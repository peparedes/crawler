2079 words; Yixing is forgetful, and they go to breakfast.

<lj-cut text=""Not in Public"">
<hr />
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Crap crap crap,&rdquo; Yixing mutters. They&rsquo;re going to be late, he knows but he isn&rsquo;t ready yet. &ldquo;Where&#39;s my iPod&mdash;Jongdae have you seen my ipo&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;On the kitchen counter.&rdquo; Jongdae says, buttoning up his coat and putting on his muffler.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh thanks.&rdquo; He hears Yixing call from the kitchen. &ldquo;Hey do you know where my ear buds are?&rdquo; Yixing asks and Jongdae shakes his head.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Night stand. Your side.&rdquo; He says and Yixing comes into the bedroom going straight for his ear buds. &ldquo;If you kept them together you wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem.&rdquo; Jongdae says handing Yixing his gloves.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah I know, I know.&rdquo; Yixing laughs it off, &ldquo;Next time I&rsquo;ll remember for sure,&rdquo; he says, rubbing the back of his neck. He takes his gloves from Jongdae and brings his other hand up to cup Jongdae&rsquo;s cheek.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Right</i>,&rdquo; Jongdae says instead of &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t make dumb promises.&rdquo; He leans in to kiss Yixing, and wraps the muffler around his boyfriend&rsquo;s neck.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s it&mdash;no wait,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not until he puts on his gloves that he notices something else is missing. &ldquo;Where&#39;s my bracelets...&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;On the table next to the couch even though I keep telling you to put them in the dresser.&rdquo; <i>Like a normal person</i>. &ldquo;What do you think? Glasses or no glasses?&rdquo; Jongdae asks holding up his black thick framed glasses up for Yixing to see. &ldquo;<i>Yixing</i>.&rdquo; He says when he doesn&rsquo;t receive an answer.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hm? You look good in whatever, Jongdae.&rdquo; Yixing mumbles absently. He&rsquo;s riffling through his duffle bag. Today the studio&rsquo;s closed so his dance classes are meeting in the western auditorium and the stage is always cold&mdash;it&rsquo;d be freezing to any sane person but is Yixing so it&rsquo;s just cold.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I asked.&rdquo; Jongdae mutters, putting his hands on his hips and then thinks better of it and turns back to look in the mirror. Looking himself over once more, he decides to go ahead and wear the glasses, liking the way they make him look smart.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;And your red sweats are in the wash so you&#39;re going to have to wear the black ones.&rdquo; Jongdae glances at Yixing through the mirror. &ldquo;The ones with the blue stripes on the sleeves.&rdquo; The black ones weren&rsquo;t as warm but they would do. &ldquo;Oh and your report&rsquo;s in your backpack. I put it there when you left it on your desk last night&mdash;like <i>usual</i>. And I put those sheet papers in the top drawer of your desk with all the other papers, but I put Bach in a folder in your backpack and...what?&rdquo; Yixing was looking at him like he&rsquo;d grown another head or something.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>What</i>?&rdquo; Jongdae says again, turning around to face the older boy. It&rsquo;s probably the first time this morning since they&rsquo;ve gotten out of bed that Yixing has given him his full attention but it makes Jongdae feel like he has something embarrassing on his face. &ldquo;It is the glasses?&rdquo; He says moving his hands to take them off.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;No, <i>no</i>.&rdquo; Yixing says quickly. &ldquo;The glasses are fine. You look wonderful. More than wonderful.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh, okay then.&rdquo; Jongdae drops his hands. &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; He says impatiently because now he&rsquo;s starting to actually get worried.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Did you also pack me lunch?&rdquo; Yixing asks and Jongdae kind of wants to throw his hands up. He hates diversions. Why can&rsquo;t Yixing ever give him a straight up answer?</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t know what you wanted so I just packed the same as mine and I put those snacks that you liked. Now what is it? Is there something on my face? <i>What</i>?&rdquo; He wants to know but Yixing just stares dumbly at him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Nothing, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; He mutters and Jongdae&rsquo;s pretty sure he&rsquo;s doing this on purpose now. He makes an exasperated noise and walks out of the bedroom. Yixing follows not long after.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh yeah&mdash;don&rsquo;t buy soda today. You already drink so much of it. Drink the tea I packed you and why do you keep looking at me that way?&rdquo; Jongdae huffs, sitting himself of the back of the couch. He crosses his arms and throws a halfhearted glare at Yixing.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he says clearing his throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I won&rsquo;t go to the vending machines today. Whatever you want.&rdquo; He walks up to Jongdae and pulls his arms apart. He leans down and kisses Jongdae&rsquo;s cheek, then pulls back. Yixing laughs quietly because he&rsquo;d been kidding about lunch, not that Jongdae has to know that.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny.&rdquo; Jongdae cups Yixing&rsquo;s chin so the older boy is looking at him. Jongdae&rsquo;s gloves are smooth along his skin. His lips are pressed together in a sort of not-pout. That frustrated look crosses his face again and Yixing laughs again.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&mdash;I love you okay?&rdquo; Yixing presses a kiss to Jongdae&#39;s lips. Jongdae&#39;s cheeks flush a slight red but once the surprise has wears off he&rsquo;s looking at Yixing with that leveled gaze, one eyebrow raised.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I know&rdquo; he says. Was that all? That still doesn&rsquo;t explain the laughing but this is Yixing so Jongdae will overlook it. &ldquo;Now hurry up and get dressed. We&#39;re&nbsp;going to Amy&rsquo;s and <i>you&rsquo;re</i> paying. I wanna get there before the breakfast rush.&rdquo;</span>
 <div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&bull;</span><span style=""font-family:segoe ui symbol,sans-serif;"">&diams;&bull;</span></div> 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yixing?&rdquo; Jongdae touches his arm. &ldquo;Geeze. I don&rsquo;t even know why I try. You <i>never</i> listen to me.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You and Joonmyun have some project to work on and Kyungsoo keeps distracting you guys. I&#39;m listening. Keep going.&rdquo; He says, sipping his iced coffee. He finished his waffles a while ago. They were waiting for Jongdae to finish his breakfast before leaving the diner and heading for the campus.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Jongdae eyes him wearily. He titles his head to side, his lips pressed into a slight pout that Yixing finds completely adorable. Of course he doesn&#39;t tell Jongdae this because the last time he told Jongdae he was adorable was last night while they were in bed. Jongdae had had his arms wrapped around him, his body was completely flushed in the most brilliant shade of red Yixing had ever seen, and making the most erotic sounds Yixing had ever heard and on second thought&hellip;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;You&rsquo;re adorable.&quot; He says, the smile on his lips widening as he watches Jongdae&#39;s cheeks tint and then flush when he begins to recall the events of last night. He half glares at Yixing but Yixing doesn&#39;t really mind because Jongdae&rsquo;s hand stays on his arm. Jongdae can&rsquo;t be that mad if he&rsquo;s still touching Yixing.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Not I&#39;m <i>public</i>.&quot; Jongdae hisses.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What? I can&#39;t compliment my boyfriend?&rdquo; Yixing says deciding that he likes this look on Jongdae. It&rsquo;s not something he gets to see every morning.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>But you&#39;re so cute when you pout.</i>&rdquo; He says in mandarin this time.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Yixing</i>!&rdquo;</span>
 
<i><span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What?</span></i><span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&rdquo; He makes a show of looking around the diner. It&rsquo;s the breakfast rush and the diner is packed but no one is paying attention to them&mdash;except maybe the group of five girls in the booth by the window who keep sneaking looks at the two of them and the guy with that perpetual blush sitting behind them but Yixing chooses to selectively forget about them and focus on what&#39;s in front of him. Besides, he doubts any of them can understand mandarin. He tells Jongdae this, absently playing with their now intertwined hands.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>But it&rsquo;s still&mdash;</i>&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Still public. I </i>know<i>.</i>&rdquo; Yixing knows. How could he forget when Jongdae doesn&#39;t even let him hold his hand ninety-nine point percent of the time they&#39;re in public. Hugs are okay sometimes, but kissing is impossible. The last time Yixing had stolen a kiss Jongdae had pushed him away and hadn&rsquo;t gone anywhere near Yixing for half the day. He put him off for nearly half a week. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">That had been last week and it&rsquo;s much too soon for Yixing to accidentally forget again and steal another, not when Yixing was enjoying Jongdae actually facing him when they were in bed. Today&#39;s starting off to be a good day. This whole week had started off well and Yixing didn&rsquo;t wasn&rsquo;t looking to change that.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>I just like your face.</i>&rdquo; Yixing steals one of Jongdae&rsquo;s sausages.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Yixi&mdash;</i>my face<i>. That&#39;s it?</i>&rdquo; Jongdae&rsquo;s hand stops midway. He narrows his eyes, affronted. Yixing thinks Jongdae would cross his arms too if Yixing wasn&#39;t currently holding one hand.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Oh I like other things too.</i>&rdquo; Yixing steals another sausage. Jongdae slaps his hand away when he reaches for another.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Like what?</i>&rdquo; Jongdae asks and Yixing smiles.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He scoots over on the stool so that he&rsquo;s closer to Jongdae. Their thighs are pressing and Yixing leans closer so their sides are too. His hand sneaks its way to Jongdae&rsquo;s hip, thumbing the waistband of his trousers. He feels Jongdae freeze under his touch. Yixing rests his head on Jongdae&rsquo;s shoulders ignoring the incredulous look Jongdae is throwing at him. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Not in public.</i>&rdquo; Yixing smirks, picking up Jongdae&rsquo;s last sausage and popping it into his mouth.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>I hate you sometimes.</i>&rdquo; This time Jongdae puts everything he has into his glare and Yixing backs away accordingly.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>That&#39;s nice Jongdae. Hurry up finish your breakfast or we&#39;re gonna be late.</i>&rdquo;</span>
 <div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&bull;</span><span style=""font-family:segoe ui symbol,sans-serif;"">&diams;&bull;</span></div> 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">They arrived at campus fairly early. Jongdae&rsquo;s classes don&rsquo;t start until noon and Yixing&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t until the next hour. Jongdae had planned on meeting Joonmyun in the student commons to go over their project in a couple minutes. Yixing has to be on stage at least ten minutes before the class actually starts anyway so they decide to go their separate ways a couple minutes after they entered the music building.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh hey wait,&rdquo; Jongdae grabs Yixing&rsquo;s arm before Yixing can get too far, &ldquo;Don&#39;t forget your lunch.&quot; He opens his bag and took out Yixing&rsquo;s lunch box. For a while Yixing just stares at him with that dopey look on his face, kind of like the same one he had on this morning and <i>oh</i>, Jongdae thinks when Yixing starts to get closer.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Not in public.&rdquo; He whines but he leans in to the kiss anyway. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you today? You&#39;re even spicier than usual.&rdquo; Jongdae asks quietly when the kiss is broken. His hands cup Yixing&rsquo;s face, caress his cheeks. He looks his boyfriend in the eyes. If there&rsquo;s something wrong he has to know.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Yixing shakes his head just like he&rsquo;s been doing the whole day&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not even half over. The thought pops up in Jongdae&rsquo;s mind and he groans internally. Yixing will drive him <i>crazy</i>. He just knows it.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Am not.&rdquo; Yixing smiles that easy smile of his. His hands come up to cover Jongdae&rsquo;s. His thumbs rub small circles in the back of Jongdae&rsquo;s hands.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Are too.&rdquo; Jongdae says because he can be stubborn too.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Am <i>not</i>.&rdquo; Yixing says. He grabs Jongdae&rsquo;s hands and starts to walk, tugging him along.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so weird,&rdquo; Jongdae mumbles, but follows without much fuss. He does complain though. &ldquo;Where are we going anyway? The commons is that way,&rdquo; he points in the opposite direction. &ldquo;And yours isn&#39;t this way either.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Yixing says absently, not answering Jongdae&rsquo;s question. It goes on like this for a couple minutes, Jongdae asking questions and making comments and Yixing not answering. It becomes a sort of game, just one in the many they play.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">After a while Yixing finally stops walking. He has his arms around Jongdae, holding him close. He leans in so that their foreheads are touching. One of his hands slips through Jongdae&rsquo;s open jacket, under his hoodie and Jongdae shivers when he feels Yixing&rsquo;s fingers on his skin.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&quot;Yixing,&quot; Jongdae warns. He knows it&rsquo;s been too short a time for Yixing to have forgotten about last week. He had made sure Yixing didn&rsquo;t forget.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>I know. Not in public.</i>&rdquo; Yixing says and then pointedly looks around. They&#39;re&nbsp;alone in an empty hallway. </span>
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">No one is around and even if someone was they wouldn&rsquo;t see them. Yixing has them pressed in against the wall in between the wall ridges that jut out a couple feet. It&rsquo;s private, secluded, and feels a little like hiding and Jongdae feels silly. He feels like a kid but when Yixing places a finger under his chin, lifts his head up so they&rsquo;re eyes meet, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter anymore.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>This is okay?</i>&rdquo; Yixing says. Jongdae can feel his breath on his lips.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says, leaning in and closing the small gap between them. This is perfect.</span></span>

793 words; Jongdae is tired from school and Yixing is watching TV on the couch.
<div style=""text-align: center;"">

</div>
<lj-cut text=""warm"">
<hr />
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like a freaking furnace.&rdquo; Jongdae mumbles. He buries himself into the tiny space between Yixing and the couch. There isn&rsquo;t that much room on the small loveseat so he ends up mostly on Yixing, their legs tangled and draped over the sofa arm. Yixing&rsquo;s head is propped up on the opposite arm with Jongdae&rsquo;s face buried in the crook of his neck, Jongdae&rsquo;s arms loosely wrapped around his shoulder.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re just cold.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s a bit of an understatement because Jongdae is <i>freezing</i>. It&rsquo;s probably because it&rsquo;s November and the only thing Jongdae has to shield himself from the cold is a T-shirt and a hoodie.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I forgot to take a jacket this morning.&rdquo; Jongdae mumbles and sighs, loving the way Yixing arms wrap around him, the way his hands rub circles in his back. He had rushed out the door that morning late for class&mdash;again, but this time it really wasn&rsquo;t his fault. He wasn&rsquo;t the one that was up until ass o&rsquo;clock in the morning banging on the keyboard finishing the project he&rsquo;d procrastinated on until the last minute and keeping his boyfriend up.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;How did the presentation go?&rdquo; He asks. He feels Yixing shrug under him.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I passed.&rdquo; Yixing says like it&rsquo;s nothing and Jongdae hates when he does that. He&rsquo;s been at the school day. There was no way he could&rsquo;ve missed all the composing students talking about the class presentations. He knew Yixing more than passed and he hated it when the other boy downplayed his talents. Any other day Jongdae would&rsquo;ve pressed this but he was cold and tired and didn&rsquo;t want to move from his spot like ever so he let it pass this once.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He just got home too&mdash;which reminds him. Jongdae lifts his head up and stays that way until Yixing finally looks away from his stupid show. Yes? His face seems to say and Jongdae just blinks, looking down at him expectantly. It takes a couple of seconds for Yixing to get it and Jongdae rolls his eyes when he sees the moment it clicks for Yixing. He gets his welcome home kiss and then another because he deserves it.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;How was your day?&rdquo; Yixing asks. His hands comb through Jongdae&#39;s hair and Jongdae closes his eyes. He blinks, a little drowsy.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Eh, same as always.&rdquo; He shrugs or shrugs as best he can while lying down. &ldquo;Did some work, ate some food, talked to some people.&rdquo; Nothing had really happened and he&#39;d come home after classes and group meetings concluded. It was late now. It had already been dark when Jongdae had left for home. Usually on Tuesday and Thursdays he had the most classes and were the most tiring.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Maybe you should go take a shower.&rdquo; Yixing says and Jongdae shakes his head. </span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wanna.&rdquo; He drops his head so he&rsquo;s facing the TV and not the back couch. &quot;This crap again?&rdquo; He says when he catches what&rsquo;s on TV.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Its not crap. Its genius.&rdquo; Yixing flicks Jongdae&rsquo;s arm.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Its about a stupid reality show about stupid people who do stupid things.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Its genius.&rdquo; Yixing insists like he always does.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Right&rdquo; Jongdae says like he always does.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Come on, get up.&rdquo; Yixing pokes him in the side and waits. When Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t move he does it again and again until Jongdae&rsquo;s squirming. He breaks out in to laughter when Yixing goes for his sides.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo; He chokes out between gasps, burring pulling himself closer to Yixing. Yixing only does when Jongdae&rsquo;s gasping for breath. Jongdae suspects that he only does either because his fingers get tired or how tightly Jongdae&rsquo;s arms are around his neck.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">When his laughter dies away Jongdae settles himself back into his previous position. Yixing&rsquo;s attention goes back his stupid show but his hands never leave Jongdae&rsquo;s back and they stay like that for a while. Yixing rubbing soothing circles on his back and Jongdae, trying not to fall asleep right then and there but it&rsquo;s so hard because Yixing is a human radiator. His warmth blankets Jongdae, seeps into his skin and forces the cold out. It gets harder and harder to keep his eyes open. Jongdae yawns quietly.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He&rsquo;s warmed up but he&rsquo;s still a little bit cold. Sighing, Jongdae decides that maybe he really should take that shower after all and pushes himself up. He doesn&rsquo;t abnormally radiate heat like Yixing does and being confined to bed with a cold during finals week isn&rsquo;t really an option so after leaning down to kiss Yixing, Jongdae makes his way to the bathroom.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You watch the weirdest crap.&rdquo; Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t forget to say halfway across the living room.</span>

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s genius.&rdquo; Yixing calls behind him and Jongdae snorts because no, it&rsquo;s not.</span>

<hr />
<lj-cut text=""The Royal Family"">

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What about this dear?&rdquo; Queen Joonmyun held up the ugliest dress shirt Baekhyun had ever seen. His younger cousin Taehyun had gifted it to him on Baekhyun&rsquo;s previous birthday as a joke. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he still had it. He thought he had told Sehun to burn it a month ago. He&rsquo;d have to talk to his little brother later.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Mother do you want me to be a laughing stock on my own coming of age ceremony?&rdquo; Baekhyun grabbed the gown from his mother&rsquo;s hands, balling it up and throwing it out the window like he should&rsquo;ve done to begin with. Joonmyun rolled his eyes at his son&rsquo;s antics.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo; The color in Joonmyun&rsquo;s face drained when he saw what Baekhyun was holding up.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Uhh&hellip;that&rsquo;s a little&hellip;no.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;Just no.&rdquo; The trousers were too short and showed way too much skin. He couldn&rsquo;t have his son&rsquo;s calves showing like one of those lascivious actors who roamed the streets Joonmyun had heard so much about.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;But <i>mother</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Baekhyun protested.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Sweetie&rdquo; Joonmyun cleared his throat, &ldquo;this is a <i>ball</i>, not a&mdash;a hoochy-choochy dance party.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hoochy&mdash;mother please never say that every again.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wearing it and that&rsquo;s final. What about this?&rdquo; Baekhyun cringed at the new gown. He hadn&rsquo;t known he had such ugly clothes in his closet. He was going to have to go through everything one day and burn all the ugly ones. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;But mother, I can&rsquo;t go in <i>that</i>. I&rsquo;ll be the laughing stock of the whole kingdom. No one wears ruffles anymore. That&rsquo;s so last century.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What about this then?&rdquo; Joonmyun kept holding up gowns, each one a little less ugly than the last, and then discarded them into a pile Baekhyun had quietly dubbed the &ldquo;to burn pile&rdquo; by the bed. Baekhyun thought that if he waited long enough his mother would finally pick something not completely hideous, but by then his ball would already have been over. He was growing impatient and, apparently, so was his mother. Joonmyun sighed. With one hand on his hip and the other waving his most recent selection in the air, he gave his son an ultimatum.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Then choose or I&rsquo;ll choose <i>for</i> you.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t choose <i>any</i> of this.&rdquo; Baekhyun huffed, planting himself on his bed. &ldquo;I need new clothes mother. I don&rsquo;t have anything to wear.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have money to get you new clothes.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have money? You and dad own the whole kingdom&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;And yet we have no money to get you new clothes.&rdquo; Joonmyun made his way to the door. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; He said turning back, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t even think about going asking your father.&rdquo; Kris was such a push over when it came to Baekhyun. Well Baekhyun and Yixing&hellip;and Chanyeol. And Kyungsoo. And Sehun. Really, Kris was just a pushover and Joonmyun blamed him for how their kids turned out.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Mother you can&rsquo;t <i>do</i> that.&rdquo; Baekhyun practically screamed. Joonmyun waved and turned down the corridor.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I can and I have.&rdquo; He said and walked out, ignoring his third oldest son&rsquo;s pleads.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not <i>fair</i>&rdquo; Baekhyun stomped his feet on the floor. &ldquo;Jongdae! Back me up. <i>Jongdae</i>.&rdquo; He turned to his best friend when he hadn&rsquo;t heard a word. Baekhyun walked to his Jongdae&rsquo;s side and looked out the window. It wasn&rsquo;t that hard to figure out what had Jongdae so enthralled.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Yixing, the kingdom&rsquo;s eldest princess, titled Fairest of Them All for the past eleven years and Baekhyun&rsquo;s eldest brother, sat in the gardens. He was singing and there were gross little critters gathering around him. Baekhyun made a face. Yixing was so weird. He could never understand what he liked about those animals. He also couldn&rsquo;t understand what why in the hell Jongdae was so obsessed with his brother.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;For the love of&mdash;<i>Jongdae</i> stop making googly eyes at my brother and help me pick out an outfit.&rdquo; Baekhyun pulled an unwilling Jongdae away from the window.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t making googly eyes at your brother!&rdquo; Jongdae defended himself, &ldquo;but so what if I was&mdash;not that I <i>was</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Jongdae started and Baekhyun rolled his eyes.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&mdash;his hair looks so soft and his skin is so fair and he&rsquo;s so gentle and the way the light hits his skin makes him look so&hellip;so <i>perfect</i>.&rdquo; Jongdae breathed the word out and Baekhyun would have found it completely sweet and adorable if it wasn&rsquo;t obvious that Jongdae thought Yixing was an angel. Yixing was most definitely <i>not</i> an angel. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He could protest to that. Before the age of fifteen Jongdae would have also, but after the summer of that particular year something had gone horribly wrong with his head. He had started to find Yixing attractive. Baekhyun and Chanyeol had done all they could to fix it but all of their attempts had been in vain. Jongdae was forever stuck a lovesick idiot.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Also one of these days Baekhyun was going to win the Fairest of Them All title and then Yixing could just suck it.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah whatever Jongdae,&rdquo; Baekhyun waved him off. There wasn&rsquo;t any time to deal with this. He had an outfit to pick out. &ldquo;What do you think about this?&rdquo; Baekhyun held up an outfit.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Not that one. It makes your hips look too wide. Do you think Yixing would look good in mauve?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;How would I know? I don&rsquo;t spend my days thinking about my brother.&rdquo; Baekhyun tossed the outfit aside and picked out another one. &ldquo;What about this one then?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;That one&rsquo;s too red. It makes your arms look fat.&rdquo; Jongdae tossed Baekhyun a different shirt. &ldquo;Try this one. What about Chanyeol then?&rdquo; Jongdae smirked.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. Chanyeol&rsquo;s not my brother.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;The eldest prince? Not your brother?&rdquo; Jongdae gasped and laughed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t marry&mdash;or <i>want</i> to marry Yixing. This family&rsquo;s messed up but not <i>that</i> messed up.&rdquo; Baekhyun threw himself on the bed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna marry Chanyeol and inherit the kingdom, the castle, fame, fortune, glory blah blah blah.&rdquo; He rolled to his back side by side with Jongdae. &ldquo;And you, my poor unlucky friend, are gonna marry my weird older brother and move to a cozy little house on the outskirts of the city where he can play with whatever little animals he wants to and you can be a creeper and stare all you want.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll visit every single month. Mother and father will insist and of course I don&rsquo;t want to deal with Sehun all by myself. And I&rsquo;ll need your council when I&rsquo;m queen. I&rsquo;ll need my head advisor.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll need me.&rdquo; Jongdae rolled his eyes. &ldquo;No one else will be fool enough to take the job. No one could handle dealing you for an extended period of time.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Baekhyun slipped his hand in Jongdae&rsquo;s. &ldquo;But you manage it,&rdquo; he says, pressing close to Jongdae&rsquo;s side.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I have to.&rdquo; Jongdae gave Baekhyun&rsquo;s hand a squeeze. &ldquo;Best friends remember.&rdquo; They&rsquo;d known each other since before they could walk. Once Baekhyun had stopped being an arrogant little jerk to him, Jongdae had stopped making fun of him and they had become the best of friends. They saw each other every day. Jongdae, being the son of the head advisor and future head advisor visited the castle just about every day with his father. When not shadowing council meetings, he could have been found with Baekhyun and Chanyeol. They were almost always together and would probably be together for a long time to come. Even if he tried, Jongdae doubted Baekhyun could get rid of him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;If you guys are done having your big gay moment, Mother wants you down for dance practice. Teacher&rsquo;s here and you know how impatient she gets.&rdquo; Kyungsoo said, staying only until the message was delivered and then running back out to a safer place within the mansion far far away from Baekhyun&rsquo;s room and wrath. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Kyungsoo</i>&rdquo; Baekhyun&rsquo;s voice boomed. Jongdae rolled away, covering his ears with one of Baekhyun&rsquo;s pillows. &ldquo;<i>What</i> did I tell you about <i>knocking</i>?&rdquo;</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">When Kyungsoo got to the bottom of the spiral stairs of Baekhyun&rsquo;s tower he tripped on the last step and fell in to the waiting arms of Kim Jongin, one of the castle guards.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Whoa hold on. Where do you think you&rsquo;re going so fast?&rdquo; Jongin spun Kyungsoo around and then set him down on the ground.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Jongin.&rdquo; Kyungsoo said, stepping back once he regained his footing but didn&rsquo;t let go of Jongin&rsquo;s arm. Kyungsoo turned back, his gaze traveling up the spiral staircase and then back to Jongin.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Baekhyun again?&rdquo; Jongin asked. Kyungsoo shrugged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in trouble again are you? Do you need protecting?&rdquo; Jongin barked out an awkward laugh and quieted a moment later when Kyungsoo didn&rsquo;t say anything, just stared at Jongin with those big round eyes of his.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I can handle my brother.&rdquo; He said quietly, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he titled his head just slightly, gazing at Jongin from underneath his lashes. He ran his hand slowly over Jongin&rsquo;s arm, fingers tracing the lean muscles. &ldquo;But if I ever do need protecting, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo; He smiled, turning and running off in the direction of the kitchen leaving Jongin stunned, staring behind him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Do you need protecting?&rdquo; Tao peaked out from behind Jongin.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh <i>Jongin</i>.&rdquo; Sehun fell against Tao, fluttering his eyelashes in a completely ridiculous manner. &ldquo;I can handle Baekhyun.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Are you sure? I could use my big, strong arms and shield you from your horrible brothers.&rdquo; Tao mocked, flexing his muscles.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh Jongin.&rdquo; Sehun fluttered his eyelashes and Jongin wanted to punch him so hard. Punch him and run away and wipe the memory of this scene from his memory.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Kyungsoo my love.&rdquo; They laughed, throwing themselves against Jongin.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; Jongin batted their arms away, untangling himself from them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo; Sehun stood straight in front of him, crossing his arms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much worse.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;So much sadder.&rdquo; Tao stood beside Sehun, matching his posture. They gave each other that look Jongin hated.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Much more pathetic.&rdquo; The two of them said together, falling against each other laughing.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Just shut the fuck up.&rdquo; Jongin yelled, pushing past the two of them.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Jongin! Is that any way to speak to your prince?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Shove it Sehun.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Prince</i> Sehun.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Shut up, <i>Prince</i> Sehun.&rdquo; Jongin gritted out, stalking off in the opposite direction Kyungsoo had gone. Much to his dismay, Tao and <i>Prince</i> Sehun followed.</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Kyungsoo slipped out the back door and into the gardens. It wasn&rsquo;t long until he saw who he was looking for sitting on the bench surrounded by birds and snakes, and other woodlin creatures that lived in the forests behind the castle. Kyungsoo plopped down beside his eldest brother with a huff.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no fun anymore. Not since all this coming of age stuff started.&rdquo; He crossed his arms, puffing his cheeks out in a pout. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t <i>this</i> bad during your ceremony.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Baekhyun just wants everything to be perfect.&rdquo; Yixing said without looking up from feeding the little garden snake that was wrapped around his arm.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah but he doesn&rsquo;t have to be a complete b&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Kyungsoo.&rdquo; Yixing chided.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kyungsoo looked at him with those big innocent eyes of his, &ldquo;I was going to say freak.&rdquo; He said. Yixing didn&rsquo;t buy it.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Freak doesn&rsquo;t start with a &lsquo;b&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Kyungsoo mumbled, looking bored.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Be nice to your bother. At least for the next couple of days.&rdquo; He added the last part quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand when it&rsquo;s your coming of age day. It&rsquo;s a stressful time. Go easy on him for now.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Why? It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s the only brother I&rsquo;ve got. Or the only other princess. Heck I don&rsquo;t even think mother would miss him if&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;He is your <i>brother</i>. And of course mother would miss him. You would too.&rdquo; Yixing stroked his younger brother&rsquo;s short hair. Kyungsoo leaned against him with a sigh.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;When you get married to Jongdae promise me you&rsquo;ll visit.&rdquo; He said, playing with the garden snake. Yixing tilted his head at his brother&rsquo;s words and paused for a couple moments before speaking again.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Who said I was getting married to Jongdae?&rdquo; He said slowly, his voice light, nonchalant.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t you like him?&rdquo; Kyungsoo asked, looking up at him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Of course I like him. He&rsquo;s a very likeable guy.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;No&rdquo; Kyungsoo shook his head. &ldquo;I mean, don&rsquo;t you <i>like</i> him like him? Isn&rsquo;t that why you&rsquo;re always looking at him and making him blush?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;make him blush&hellip;&rdquo; Yixing said quietly but by the look Kyungsoo gave him, he could tell his younger brother wasn&rsquo;t buying it.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Well&hellip;say that you did want to make him blush? Hypothetically of course. What would you do? I mean without actually doing anything.&rdquo; Yixing thought about the question for a while. He narrowed his eyes and glanced down at his brother. They weren&rsquo;t talking about Jongdae anymore.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Kyungsoo, is this about Jongin again?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Kyungsoo protested and then seemed to think better of it. &ldquo;I mean, not really. He&rsquo;s alright I guess. He has a nice face and he&rsquo;s always nice and not a total idiot like Sehun and Tao.&rdquo; &ldquo;And his butt&rsquo;s not too bad.&rdquo; At that Yixing laughed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You really like him don&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Of course I like him Yixing. He&rsquo;s all I think about. Like every day! Every second of every day! And I&rsquo;m so sick of it.&rdquo; Kyungsoo crossed his arms. &ldquo;All I ever think about is if he likes me or not. I mean sometimes I don&rsquo;t even think he notices me.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh, he notices you.&rdquo; Yixing couldn&rsquo;t count the number of times he&rsquo;s caught the other boy staring at the youngest princess, sometimes in inappropriate places, but Yixing was willing to overlook that since the boy hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything. Yixing didn&rsquo;t think Jongin had the courage and he was hopping it stayed that way. Preferably after Kyungsoo had his own coming of age ceremony, but until then Yixing was content to sneak icy glares at the other boy when he got too close to his precious younger brother, with Baekhyun&rsquo;s help of course.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have anything to worry about there, Soo.&rdquo; Yixing said, &ldquo;Just, don&rsquo;t make any rash decisions.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Rash decisions huh?&rdquo; Kyungsoo lay his head on Yixing&rsquo;s lap. He closed his eyes and let the sunlight warm him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose cornering him and making out would be too rash do you?&rdquo; He asked and Yixing laughed.</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">It wasn&rsquo;t until he could hear Baekhyun&rsquo;s yells that Luhan knew they had arrived at the castle. He glanced to Minseok, who had on a fond smile that probably matched his own and chuckled.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">The carriage stopped and Minseok got out first. After surveying the area and making sure there weren&rsquo;t any malicious beings out to get the young duke&rsquo;s life, he held out his hand to help Luhan climb out. Luhan rolled his eyes. He wasn&rsquo;t a frickin&rsquo; princess and he hated being treated like one. He didn&rsquo;t need as much protection as Minseok obviously thought he needed but complied anyway. Secretly, not so secretly&mdash;he was pretty sure the whole castle knew anyway&mdash;he liked holding Minseok&rsquo;s hand.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Brother!&rdquo; Kris exclaimed, pulling Luhan into a crushing hug.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Brother.&rdquo; Luhan chocked out, patting his brother on the back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been forever.&rdquo; Kris released him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo; Luhan rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Three weeks hardly counts as forever.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It does when one of your sons is in the middle of planning his coming of age ceremony.&rdquo; He said with a cringe and now that Luhan looked closer, Kris didn&rsquo;t look as well off as he normally did. He looked worn out and sleep deprived. His eye bags were big enough to rival Zitao&rsquo;s.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Minseok!&rdquo; Kris embraced the other man. &ldquo;Good to see you. I hope my brother hasn&rsquo;t caused much trouble for you.&rdquo; He said in that haughty king voice Luhan hated. Again, he rolled his eyes. Minseok laughed and shook his head.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Not as more than usual.&rdquo; He said this looking straight at Luhan and Luhan might or might not have melted a little at the smirk playing his bodyguard&rsquo;s lips.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Did some say Minseok?&rdquo; Zitao magically bounced out from somewhere out of the castle. &ldquo;Minseok is here?&rdquo; He lit up when he saw the older man and headed towards him. &ldquo;Oh, hello sire.&rdquo; He said with a slight bow as if it was an afterthought and if Luhan didn&rsquo;t know how much Zitao adored his old trainer, he might&rsquo;ve taken offense.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Uncle Minseok!&rdquo; Kyungsoo ran came, also out nowhere. He ran up to the older man and enveloped him a fierce hug. &ldquo;Finally. I was beginning to wonder when you&rsquo;d come again.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Kyungsoo&hellip;&rdquo; Luhan muttered dejected.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh, hi uncle Luhan.&rdquo; Kyungsoo turned to him for a second before turning back to Minseok, continuing whatever he was saying. Minseok smiled and shrugged, amused. He was soon led away.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Not fair Kyungsoo. I saw him first!&rdquo; Zitao whined, pulling on one of Minseok&rsquo;s arm.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Well tough Tao. Uncle Minseok&rsquo;s gonna help me practice my martial arts.&rdquo; Kyungsoo, who had glued himself to Minseok&rsquo;s other arm, stuck his tongue out at the younger boy.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not even your real uncle&hellip;&rdquo; was the last thing Luhan heard as the trio disappeared into the castle grounds. Luhan watched them go with mixed feelings and after a couple moments of indecisiveness abandoned Kris and set out to follow them.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">It was Kris&rsquo;s turn to roll his eyes. His brother was such a loser, he thought with a smirk and followed after Luhan.</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I would say pouting doesn&rsquo;t suit you, but you&rsquo;ve still got that baby face.&rdquo; Luhan clamped down on his lip tighter and puffed out his cheeks more when he heard the voice.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Princess Yixing.&rdquo; Luhan greeted, rolling over on the blanket. He wasn&rsquo;t feeling up to getting verbally abused that afternoon but Minseok was playing with Kyungsoo and Zitao and Luhan was bored.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Luhan&rdquo; Yixing greeted with a slight bow of his head, the evil smirk on his face ever present. Yixing had to be Luhan&rsquo;s least favorite nephew. He wasn&rsquo;t as cute as Kyungsoo and his
&ldquo;prettiness&rdquo; compared to Baekhyun was debatable&hellip;heavily, by one of Baekhyun&rsquo;s friends Yixing had somehow managed to con into falling for him. Jongdae his name was, and Luhan felt sorry for the poor sap. Though they <i>did</i> say the same of Minseok before and after he became Luhan&rsquo;s personal bodyguard but Luhan was just going to ignore the whole connection there and what it said about him as a person.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">The point was Yixing was evil and always made fun of Luhan even when Luhan never did anything to antagonize him, which sure, wasn&rsquo;t very often, but it did happen.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry about him dear, he&rsquo;s just a little grumpy.&rdquo; Joonmyun said patting the quilt for Yixing to sit down. Yixing did. He sat right on Luhan&rsquo;s hand.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oops.&rdquo; He said as a sort-of-apology that Luhan didn&rsquo;t accept anyway.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Sehun was interested in fighting.&rdquo; Kris nodded in approval as the youngest prince and Jongin entered the courtyard. He was dressed down, perfect for combat.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;he&rsquo;s not honey.&rdquo; Joonmyun patted Kris&rsquo;s arm and watched amused as the blush spread on the youngest prince&rsquo;s cheeks and down his neck when Zitao slung an arm around his shoulders, giving him his best smile. The boy was a goner, Joonmyun thought, prying for his youngest not to make a spectacular fool of himself out there.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Yixing laughed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Father, there&rsquo;s only one thing Sehun&rsquo;s interested in and it&rsquo;s not combat.&rdquo; Yixing snickered and Kris watched the boys in the courtyard, a confused expression marring his features. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever ran a day in his life,&rdquo; Yixing continued, &ldquo;god knows how&rsquo;s so skinny. He eats a ton and never&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Luhan looked up after a moment of silence, wondering what had finally shut Yixing up. It didn&rsquo;t take long to locate the source. Jongdae, the poor besotted bloke, was standing not ten feet away, waving at Yixing. He was blushing and had on a ridiculously dopey smile on, like the one Luhan sometimes had on when he looked at Minseok but really that wasn&rsquo;t the best of analogies because Minseok was ridiculously handsome. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He had an incredible body, stunning eyes and lips, a cute nose, the softest hair Luhan had ever felt and the way it fluttered when the wind caught it made Luhan&rsquo;s chest flutter. Yixing though, he was covered in twigs and dirt and smelled like wildlife. He had probably gone out into to forest again to play with his little animal friends.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Minseok&rsquo;s so much better.&rdquo; Luhan muttered but not low enough for Yixing <i>not</i> to catch it.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Is not.&rdquo; Yixing said narrowing his eyes at Luhan when Jongdae disappeared somewhere into the castle. Luhan accepted the challenge.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; He said loud enough for both Joonmyun and Kris to hear, &ldquo;when&rsquo;s the wedding.&rdquo; The King and Queen turned so fast Luhan&rsquo;s neck hurt.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What wedding?&rdquo; The king asked confused.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yixing&mdash;&rdquo; Joonmyun started.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Mother&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that Jongdae boy again is it?&rdquo; Kris narrowed his eyes.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yixing&mdash;I know you&mdash;I know you think you love him and he loves you but it&rsquo;s too soon. You&rsquo;re too young&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Mother, Father PLEASE&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It is about that Jongdae boy. Yixing you have to be careful.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice boy, but you have to take things slow&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>OhMyGOD</i>&mdash;Mother! Father!&rdquo; Yixing yelled. He clamped his hand over his ears, Luhan assumed to filter out the sound of his parents, and stood up. His face was glowing red. The speed at which he fled was impressive. Luhan counted that as a victory. Yixing was probably going to get him back for this but that was later and was Minseok taking off his outer shirt?</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Where are my socks!&rdquo; Chanyeol ripped through his wardrobe, throwing the clothes all of the room.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll like flowers?&rdquo; Jongdae huffed, hugging a pillow to his chest.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Does this shirt go with these pants?&rdquo; Chanyeol held the pants to his waist and looked in the mirror, &ldquo;Nah. They&rsquo;re too brown.&rdquo; He discarded the clothes without waiting for an answer and picked up another pair of trousers.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I wonder if he likes strawberry bread. My mom bakes the best strawberry bread.&rdquo; Who didn&rsquo;t like blueberry bread? Wasn&rsquo;t it like a sin not to like strawberries? Jongdae rolled around on the bed in deep contemplation.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my belt. I know I put it in the laundry to be washed last week.&rdquo; Chanyeol marched to his hamper and dug through it. He didn&rsquo;t find the belt.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What about blueberry bread? No one can dislike blueberry bread.&rdquo; Well no one but his aunt who lived in the next town over, but only because she always broke out in hives when she got ate them.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Jongdae are you going to help me or not?&rdquo; Chanyeol asked looking down at his best friend. He was so close Jongdae jumped when he turned to him, surprised at the proximity.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Okay okay,&rdquo; Jongdae froze when he say the horrendous outfit Chanyeol was holding up. &ldquo;Ew, you can&rsquo;t go in those.&rdquo; Jongdae said, disgusted at his best friend&rsquo;s lack of taste. &ldquo;Baekhyun&rsquo;ll kill you for embarrassing him. And then I&rsquo;d kill you for being such as eyesore. Why do you even <i>own</i> that.&rdquo; He grabbed the clothes and chucked them into a corner.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure father picked it out.&rdquo; Chanyeol said and Jongdae nodded slowly.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Right. Please don&rsquo;t accept any clothes as gifts before I check them out. Or Beak does.&rdquo; He thought for a second and then appended, &ldquo;Or better yet, just toss anything the king gives you. The queen as well.&rdquo; He added as an afterthought remembering his morning with Baekhyun.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Just sit down.&rdquo; Jongdae pushed Chanyeol onto the bed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick them out for you.&rdquo; Chanyeol did as he was told without protest, glad that he didn&rsquo;t have to pick his outfit himself. At his coming of age ceremony Baekhyun and Jongdae had teamed up to make sure Chanyeol was presentable. This year, Baekhyun was far too busy and the only one Chanyeol could rely on was Jongdae. Speaking of Baekhyun&hellip;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hey, what do you think I should get him?&rdquo; Chanyeol fiddled with the sleeve of his undershirt.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hn? What?&rdquo; Jongdae called from within his closet. &ldquo;Get who what?&rdquo; He emerged with an arm full of clothes.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Baek. For his ceremony. What are you getting him?&rdquo; He stood up and stretched his arms out. Jongdae draped the top after top on him, mix and matching them with an assortment of trousers.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Clothes.&rdquo; Jongdae said after a while, &ldquo;I thought you had your gift already prepared.&rdquo; He frowned at the crowned prince.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I did, but then Sehun told me what his gift was and Baekhyun doesn&rsquo;t need two chests of jewels&rdquo; He smiled sheepishly.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What about a new pair of boots? He could always use another pair.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;He has like a hundred of them already. They&rsquo;ll just get lost in his collection.&rdquo; In his chambers Baekhyun had a massive room just for his clothes and shoes. Chanyeol didn&rsquo;t want his gift to end up in that mass. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Jongdae.&rdquo; Chanyeol slumped down on the armchair beside the bed with a heavy <i>thud</i>. &ldquo;I just&mdash;I want to give him something nice. Something he&rsquo;ll keep with him always and not just store it away. It&rsquo;s his freakin&rsquo; coming of age ceremony. It has to be special.&rdquo; He signed, scrubbing his face with his hands. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Why was it so hard to give good presents? Chanyeol almost wished this was just any old birthday part. Then he could give Baekhyun whatever lame gift he thought of and it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered so much, but this wasn&rsquo;t just some birthday party and Chanyeol would&rsquo;ve never forgave himself if he gave his princess just some lame thoughtless gift.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeol,&rdquo; Jongdae placed his hand on Chanyeol&rsquo;s back, rubbing in small, soothing circles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stress yourself out over this. It&rsquo;ll be fine whatever you give him. You know he&rsquo;ll love anything you give him.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Chanyeol signed, &ldquo;yeah but I just want it to be perfect. Not like those dumb ones I always give him.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Jongdae leaned down, cupping Chanyeol&rsquo;s face in his hands, &ldquo;Hey, hey, hey. Don&rsquo;t look like that. Whatever you manage to think of will be amazing. And besides, not everything has to be perfect all the time. You and Baek are betrothed remember? You two are gonna be together for you whole lives. Even if you mess up, and I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t&mdash;trust me Chanyeol you won&rsquo;t. I know these things&mdash;you&rsquo;ve still got the whole rest of your life to give him something that is perfect. He&rsquo;s not going to be disappointed in you or anything so stop stressing about things you don&rsquo;t need to stress about.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Just, whatever you get him, just make it expensive.&rdquo; Jongdae said and the two boys laughed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Chanyeol looked up at Jongdae and his friend gave him a reassuring smile. Jongdae always knew what to say and Chanyeol was thankful he had such a good friend.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Chanyeol gave him a small smile. &ldquo;What would I do without you.&rdquo; Jongdae opened his mouth with that look his always had when he was about to make a really smug comment and Chanyeol quickly added &ldquo;Hurry up and marry Yixing already.&rdquo; Whatever sarcastic comment he had died on his lips. He froze, his ears turned bright red. Chanyeol exploded in laughter.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Common,&rdquo; Chanyeol stood, patting his best friend on the back, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish up here. If we&rsquo;re late for supper mother&rsquo;s going to kill me.</span>

<lj-cut text=""The Royal Family part 2"">

<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Supper was a partly chaotic affair. There was a lot of stabbing and yelling, mostly by Kyungsoo and Sehun who were seated next to each other with a basket of cherry pies between them. Chanyeol and Baekhyun sat close together as they always did. Jongdae sat across from them, trying not to blatantly stare at Yixing who was seated directly across from him. He also tried not to blush when Yixing met his gaze or get flustered when Yixing smiled. He failed miserably, knocking things over and making weird noising but that seemed to make Yixing laugh and smile more so it wasn&rsquo;t all bad.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Luhan had pushed his chair right beside Minseok&rsquo;s&mdash;for special protection of course. Who knew what kind of dangers hid in the castle&rsquo;s great dining hall? Luhan certainly didn&rsquo;t and so obviously he had to have Minseok right by his side. Kris and Joonmyun were seated next to each other at the head of the table; occasionally intervening when between the epic battle between Sehun and Kyungsoo got a little out of hand, but for the most part ignored the two youngest in favor of making small talk with the rest of the table.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">After supper the family retired to the family room as they did every night. Chanyeol called the cluster of seats by the window and dragged Baekhyun and Jongdae along with him. Kyungsoo joined them, sitting on the duvet beside Jongdae. He had learned not to take the seat next to his two older siblings, especially not when they were trying to be <i>subtle</i>. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">They played Fox and Geese for a while and then Alquerques. Kyungsoo was grateful when Jongdae suggested a change of game. They had played many rounds and he had lost most of them. He suspected Chanyeol of cheating. Baekhyun suspected it was because a certain guard, who was sitting only a couple feet away, was distracting Kyungsoo. Kyungsoo couldn&rsquo;t help the heat that spread over his face or the way his foot jutted out, accidentally colliding with Baekhyun&rsquo;s shin when the other three started laughing. He turned away from them, which probably wasn&rsquo;t the best of ideas. It was bad enough that Kyungsoo could see Jongin staring at him through the periphery of his vision, seeing it head on made him feel hotter and not just in his head.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Sehun and Tao fell over each other in poorly stifled giggles. Doing his best to ignore them, Jongin, his face flushed red, turned to back to the game. He moved his chess piece and winced at the noise his piece made when he set it on the board a little too roughly. Sehun and Tao&rsquo;s laughs got louder.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yo&mdash;&rdquo; Jongin croaked. He cleared his throat and tried again, &ldquo;your turn.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fun playing when you can&rsquo;t even focus on the game.&rdquo; Sehun said but moved his piece anyway. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know why I call you up here when all you do is stare at my brother.&rdquo; He backed away from the table and leaned into Tao. He twisted his hands in Tao&rsquo;s fur jacket, the one the youngest guard always insisted on wearing everywhere he went. It was soft and Sehun loved the feel of the black fur on his skin.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just go over there and talk to him or something? It&rsquo;s not like you don&rsquo;t go to his room every night anyway.&rdquo; Tao snickered.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo; Jongin said quietly and Sehun rolled his eyes.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Really.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a question but Jongin wasn&rsquo;t about to lie about his relationship with the youngest princess when Kyungsoo&rsquo;s parents, weird uncle and scary older siblings&mdash;minus Sehun because Jongin could deal with Sehun&mdash;were sitting only a couple feet away. They spoke in low voices but he wasn&rsquo;t about to take any chances.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Really. We don&rsquo;t <i>do</i> anything. He just&mdash;he just likes fairytales.&rdquo; Jongin muttered. Ignoring the looks his two friends were giving him, Jongin made his move. &ldquo;Check.&rdquo;</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Baekhyun watched Jongdae&rsquo;s retreating back. The room was slowly emptying. His father and mother were going off to do whatever they did at night after dinner, Baekhyun tried not to think about it. Uncle Luhan and Minseok had gone off towards Luhan&rsquo;s chambers and probably weren&rsquo;t going to be seen again for the rest of the night. Yixing had disappeared around the same time as the brats had.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going off to?&rdquo; Chanyeol&rsquo;s eyes blinked open. He had been drifting in and out for the last couple minutes. It was getting late. The sun had set hours ago, and Baekhyun supposed it was time to get to bed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;The bathroom.&rdquo; He wrapped an arm around Chanyeol, &ldquo;You should get to bed.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What? No way. I&rsquo;m perfectly fine. Not tired at all.&rdquo; Chanyeol made a show of sitting up. He wrapped his arms about Baekhyun in a tight embrace and they both laughed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;<i>Right</i>.&rdquo; Baekhyun snorted. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to go just yet.&rdquo; He said. The smile on his lips was soft, the look in his eyes more than fond. He wasn&rsquo;t allowed up in Chanyeol&rsquo;s chambers after dark and Chanyeol wasn&rsquo;t allowed in his tower. On any other night, he wouldn&rsquo;t have cared&mdash;their parents had already left and he wasn&rsquo;t so scared of getting caught. They were already betrothed to each other, Baekhyun didn&rsquo;t understand why they even had this stupid rule&mdash;but this wasn&rsquo;t any other night.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Worried?&rdquo; Chanyeol laid his head on Baekhuyn&rsquo;s lap. Baekhyun stroked his hair and after a while he nodded.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;And excited.&rdquo; He sighed, &ldquo;and so fucking scared.&rdquo; Baekhyun said and Chanyeol laughed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah, that sounds about right.&rdquo; Chanyeol remembered. Chanyeol had had his coming of age ceremony a year ago. It was Baekhyun&rsquo;s turn now. He knew what the other boy was going through, knew how anxious he was. He hadn&rsquo;t been able to sleep the night before his ceremony. Jongdae, Baekhyun and him had snuck down into the forests behind the castle and stayed there, talking and watching the stars until they were too tired to keep their eyes open and then made their way back to their rooms before anyone noticed they were gone.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Chanyeol took Baekhyun&rsquo;s hand in his own, looking up at his princes, his voice raspy with sleep. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll be you with you.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Baekhyun muttered, leaning down. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He repeated, pressing his lips to Chanyeol&rsquo;s, quick and sweet, and laughed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Tomorrow he would be of age. He wouldn&rsquo;t be seen as a child anymore, even though sometimes he still felt like one. He would have all these new responsibilities thrust upon him. He would have to start getting serious in his trainings. He was going to be queen in a couple of years but he was so far behind Yixing in training it was almost a joke. Yixing didn&rsquo;t even want to be queen. Baekhyun had never really taken the training seriously, not even after his father had announced his betrothal to Chanyeol when he was crowned heir to the throne.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He felt like he was entering another world, like everything was going to change once the ceremony was over. This was growing up, he thought and it frightened him. It frightened him so much but he was also excited. There were so many things he could do after his ceremony like travel overnight and speak at court and stay up after midnight.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">This was more than a little overwhelming but he knew he could handle it given time. Also he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be alone which took much of the stress off. He had his family, even though they irritated him to high heaven more than half the time but he knew they would stand by and support him in any decisions he made. He had Jongdae, who he knew would stay by his side no matter what. And then there was Chanyeol.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">When Kris had first brought the young boy home Baekhyun had hated him. He was dirty and had no manners even though he had already passed six summers. His parents should have taught him better, Baekhyun had told him. He had gotten in trouble for that and he didn&rsquo;t understand why until Joonmyun sat him down and explained to him that Chanyeol didn&rsquo;t have any parents, that he hadn&rsquo;t had any parents for a long time now. Baekhyun had gone easier on the boy after that. It took only a few short years before they began to actually get a long, a couple short months later they become inseparable.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Baekhyun doesn&rsquo;t really know how he had fallen for Chanyeol, not really. He hadn&rsquo;t woken up one day and professed his love to the other boy&mdash;no, it had probably taken years, Baekhyun thought. Each year, Chanyeol had grown more and more beautiful until he had become the most beautiful person Baekhyun had ever seen, not just in looks alone but also in his actions and his words. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">There was beauty in the way Chanyeol held himself, in court and at home. It was in the successes he gained and in the mistakes he made. It was even in the way his features scrunched up into the comical expression when he laughed. He loved just about everything about the other boy. What he loved the most was that Chanyeol felt the same way, but about him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Baek?&rdquo; Chanyeol&rsquo;s warm hand caressed his cheeks and Baekhyun didn&rsquo;t know when he had gotten so tired. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go up.&rdquo; Chanyeol sat up and wrapped an arm around Baekhyun and Baekhyun leaned into him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He muttered, burying his face in Chanyeol&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Big day tomorrow.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah. Big day.&rdquo; He heard Chanyeol mumble and drifted off.</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Stop smelling me.&rdquo; Tao laughed but did nothing to push Sehun away.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Shut up, you like it.&rdquo; Sehun muttered into the shoulder of Tao&rsquo;s fur overcoat.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;And watch your hand!&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He held up their intertwined hands. &ldquo;You said I could.&rdquo; He had even asked permission and everything this time.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;The <i>other</i> one.&rdquo; Tao threw him a look and Sehun&rsquo;s mouth went dry. He wondered if Tao knew how hot he looked when he narrowed his eyes like that.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo; Sehun did his best to make his voice sound normal, willed his brain to focus on the topic at hand. <i>His</i> hand. His <i>other</i> hand. The one that had somehow found its way to Tao&rsquo;s ass. Sehun couldn&rsquo;t blame his hand. Tao had a fantastic ass. Obviously his hand had great taste he said and Tao laughed. Sehun loved his laugh. He let his hand drop.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Better?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Much better.&rdquo; Tao smiled. He leaned in and Sehun stilled. &ldquo;Thanks for walking me <i>prince</i> Sehun.&rdquo; Tao smirked into the skin of Sehun&rsquo;s neck then disappeared down the dark corridor to the guard chambers.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Night.&rdquo; He muttered, dazed. He brought his hand up to the spot on his neck where Tao had pressed his lips, a slow smile spread on his face.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">When he could no longer hear the sound of Tao&rsquo;s footsteps, Sehun slumped down. He hated it when Tao did that, hated it even more that it turned him on so much. He was so doomed when it came to Tao. He knew it; Tao knew it and took full advantage whenever he could, not that Sehun minded. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">At least Tao let him hold his hand this time. That was new. He had also kind of, sort of kissed Sehun&mdash;well it was close to a kiss as Sehun was probably going to get right now, but he was working on that. It wans&rsquo;t <i>all</i> hopeless, Sehun thought. Now all he had to do was wipe that grin off his face before one of his family members or Jongin saw. They would never live that down.</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Where are <i>you</i> going?&rdquo; Luhan reached out for Minseok&rsquo;s hand. They had reached his chambers but Minseok was walking off in the other direction. Minseok raised one of his perfectly plucked eyebrows.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;To my room sire.&rdquo; He said slowly and Luhan made a face.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yes, but why?&rdquo; Luhan opened the door to his chambers. Tugging Minseok along, he entered his rooms. &ldquo;You can sleep right here.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not like he wasn&rsquo;t going to sleep here anyway. Luhan had a perfectly good bed. It was soft and warm and fit two just fine.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Sire.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You ditched me this afternoon <i>and</i> evening and <i>then</i> left me alone with that evil princess to play with those brats. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m gonna let you escape this time.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;But sire&mdash;&rdquo; Minseok started and stopped when Luhan puffed out his cheeks and looked away, &ldquo;But Luhan&hellip;&rdquo; Minseok corrected himself. He cupped Luhan&rsquo;s cheeks in his hands, turning it so the taller man was facing him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Better.&rdquo; Luhan muttered slipping his arms around Minseok&rsquo;s waist.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I have to go change. I&rsquo;m all sweaty.&rdquo; He was. Very. He had been out in the sun all evening after dinner. His forehead reflected light a homing beacon even in the candle light. His hair was matted to his head in clumps. Luhan thought it was adorable but didn&rsquo;t say anything. He knew how much Minseok hated being called that and angering the man was far from the quickest way to get him into Luhan&rsquo;s bed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;But I like you sweaty. You look very dashing,&rdquo; is what he said instead. &ldquo;My knight in damp armor.&rdquo; &nbsp;Minseok laughed and Luhan counted that as a small victory. &ldquo;Besides you can shower in <i>here</i>. I don&rsquo;t mind. I mean,&rdquo; Luhan muttered leaning in, &ldquo;What if ninjas attack me while you&rsquo;re gone? What&rsquo;ll I do then? Surely <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t defend myself.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Not even with a lifetime of self-defense training <i>and</i> weapons training?&rdquo; Minseok sounded more amused than anything else. Minseok fiddled with Luhan&rsquo;s hair. He shifted as Luhan nuzzled the crook of his neck; breathed out a laugh as Luhan&rsquo;s breathe tickled his skin.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh please Minseok. We all know you&rsquo;re the only one fast enough for ninjas.&rdquo; Luhan traced little patterns in the back of Minseok&rsquo;s shirt.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I supposed am.&rdquo; Minseok tried to guess what they were but gave up when Luhan&rsquo;s finger found the line of his spin.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;So stay?&rdquo; Luhan asked with a bright smile and really Minseok no longer had plans of leaving.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;You know I was going to come right back right?&rdquo; He removed Luhan&rsquo;s hand from his back and began unbuttoning his top shirt, making his way to the bathroom.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Well now you don&rsquo;t have to ever leave.&rdquo; Luhan smiled, trailing behind his bodyguard.</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Well&hellip;here we are.&rdquo; Jongin motioned to the door, &ldquo;At your room.&rdquo; He said so awkwardly, mentally kicking himself. Could he have been any more of an idiot?</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Would you like to come in?&rdquo; Kyungsoo asked quietly, not looking at the guard. &ldquo;I mean only for a bit, for a story.&rdquo; He smiled and that was really all it took to get Jongin to follow him inside.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Three hours later Joonmyun quietly opened the door to his youngest princess&rsquo;s room. He was careful enough not to make a sound and swiftly made his way towards to bed. Kyungsoo lay snoring in between the sheets, tucked in neatly, clutching a pillow towards his chest. Joonmyun ran a hand down his template, brushing away loose strands of hair. He kissed Kyungsoo&rsquo;s cheek and whispered a soft good night.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Joonmyun then turned to the other boy. Jongin sat slumped in the chair beside kyungsoo&rsquo;s bed. He was drooling on a pillow Kyungsoo had probably lent him and Joonmyun was careful not to touch it when he shook the boy awake. The boy woke with a start, like usual, and Joonmyun waited the necessary moments for Jongin to realize where he was and what time it was. He turned bright red, as per usual, when he caught sight of the queen. Joonmyun put his index finger to his lips, nodding his head to Kyungsoo. Jongin nodded back.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Jongin returned the chair to its place at the small table in the middle of the room, picked up the book that he must have dropped when he had nodded off and placed it on the Kyungsoo&rsquo;s nightstand.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Thank you Jongin, for reading to him.&rdquo; Joonmyun said once they were out of the room, walking down the hall.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;No problem uh your highness.&rdquo; Jongin muttered. He never did know how to act around the queen. It was even worse around the king. He always muttered and murmured and the king and queen had to ask him to repeat himself. Joonmyun didn&rsquo;t know why he was so nervous, it wasn&rsquo;t as if they hadn&rsquo;t known each other since the boy was just a lad who followed his father to the castle everyday just to catch a look at the youngest princess, which he had dubbed the prettiest of them all. Kyungsoo hadn&rsquo;t liked that nickname, claiming that it wasn&rsquo;t manly enough for a princess and Jongin had blushed bright red. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">They had gotten into a fight that day, Jongin and Kyungsoo but had soon gotten over it. They hadn&rsquo;t gotten close per say, not like Baekhyun and Jongdae, though Joonmyun supposed they were close in their own way. On some nights, most nights actually now that Kyungsoo knew he could get away with it, Kyungsoo invited Jongin in to his chambers. Kris and himself had been pissed as hell then he had found out what was going on but had a laugh about it when they had learned what was really going on.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Fairy tales,&rdquo; Jongin has stammered, unable to look at the King and Queen with those frightened eyes of his all those months ago. &ldquo;He likes fairy tales, so I read them to him. Just until he falls asleep. Then I leave. I <i>swear</i>.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">After that, the King&rsquo;s heart had been at peace. Joonmyun&rsquo;s though, not so much. He had kept a small group of servants whose main duty was to spy on the two when they were alone together in Kyungsoo&rsquo;s room because he wasn&rsquo;t an idiot. Kyungsoo got away with a lot of things but Joonmyun was not about to allow his youngest princess to get deflowered at such a young age by a castle guard of similar age. Kyungsoo could be very persuasive when he wanted to be, and Joonmyun worried for both of them.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Joomyun&rsquo;s heart had calmed when he it because obvious that Jongin was too much of a pussy to do anything to his precious princess. Joonmyun had means of making it stay that way until long after Kyungsoo&rsquo;s coming of age ceremony. He had long given up on the idea of Kyungsoo being the saving grace in the family and marring someone rich, successful, preferable with a title above duke, but, Joonmyun sighed, this was love and he couldn&rsquo;t get in the way of that. Not when his own mother had let him follow his heart.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He bid Jongin good night and made his way to his own chambers. Kris was already is bed when he arrived, just where Joonmyun had left him.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s in bed and asleep?&rdquo; Kris mumbled, his eyes still closed.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s in bed and asleep.&rdquo; Joonmyun repeated, changing into his night gown. He crawled into bed, curling up against his husband, tired and ready to pass out. &ldquo;At least I think.&rdquo; He muttered. He couldn&rsquo;t shake off the feeling that something wasn&rsquo;t quite right but for once chose to ignore it. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kris asked, wrapping his arms around Joonmyun.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Oh probably nothing.&rdquo; Joonmyun shook his head and yawned, smiling. He pressed his lips to Kris&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; He settled under the covers and closed his eyes. It was hard work having a family, especially one as boisterous as his was, but he loved them just the same. Tomorrow, though, was going to be one hell of a day. He was going to need all the energy he could get.</span>
 
 
 
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Yixing leaned against the stone wall, looking out the window. The sky was filled with stars but Jongdae had trouble focusing on them when Yixing was right there. He had trouble focusing on a lot of things when Yixing was around. And when Yixing wasn&rsquo;t around.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;So, when we <i>do</i> get married,&rdquo; Jongdae walked to stand beside eldest princess. He leaned on the edge of the window and crossed his arms over the ledge.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Who said we were getting married?&rdquo; Yixing asked and Jongdae poked him in the ribs then proceeded to tickle him until he was gasping for breath.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Okay, okay.&rdquo; Yixing cried, clasping both of Jongdae&rsquo;s hands together to stop him from tickling him. Jongdae took a couple moments to process the fact that Yixing was touching him and was this considered holding hands because this should&rsquo;ve been considered holding hands. And if they were holding hands did that mean something? Should be have said something? What would he say? What should he say to Yixing?</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Would you be offended if I brought you flowers?&rdquo; He blurted out. &ldquo;Do you like blueberry bread? Or strawberry bread? My mom makes them really well and I can learn, you know, if you do like them. And I&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Whoa Jongdae slow down.&rdquo; Yixing said, smiling. He shifted and yeah, now they were definitely holding hands. Jongdae could feel his ears redden. <i>Slow down?</i> He thought to himself. He was just getting started.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; He promptly shut his mouth when Yixing raise a finger to his lips, <i>Jongdae&rsquo;s</i> lips and Jongdae stood very <i>very</i> still.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I love you princess Yixing.&rdquo; Great, Jongdae thought. That hadn&rsquo;t meant to come out. He probably should have stopped talking then, but he opened his mouth and words just kept coming through. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;I mean I did, but I didn&rsquo;t mean to say it out loud. But I do like you Yixing. I like you a lot.&rdquo; </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Yixing laughed. Jongdae loved the sound. It was light. So light it seemed to pass right through him and seep into his chest. It settled there and made his heart beat faster, warmed him from the inside. &ldquo;You know, my parents think we&rsquo;re young too get married?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;We probably are.&rdquo; Yixing had barely pasted twenty-two summers and Jongdae was a year younger, but he didn&rsquo;t see any problem there. Baekhyun and Chanyeol were younger and they were practically married.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">Yixing dropped Jongdae&rsquo;s hands and Jongdae missed the warmth of them. Yixing placed one hand on his hips and propped his elbow on the window ledge, his head, titled, sat on his hand. He looked at Jongdae through slightly narrowed eyes. He stayed that way for what felt like a tiny infinity where Jongdae tried hard not to squirm and then he spoke as if there had been no pause.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re the son of a court advisor.&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Advisor&rsquo;s <i>apprentice</i>. I get my certification next month.&rdquo; Jongdae had been working hard on his certification. He didn&rsquo;t spend all Baekhyun and Chanyeol doing nothing all the time. He wasn&rsquo;t royal like his best friends were. He had to work.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Okay, advisor&rsquo;s apprentice.&rdquo; Yixing corrected himself. &ldquo;Either way why would a royal princess want anything to do with you?&rdquo; The question took Jongdae by surprise. He hadn&rsquo;t been excepting that. He had many good qualities. He was handsome, he was kind, he was friendly and outgoing and really the list went on and one. He could&rsquo;ve picked from any one of them, was going to, but then he opened his mouth.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo; Apparently his mouth still wasn&rsquo;t working. Foolishly he tried again. &ldquo;And you like me too&hellip;I think.&rdquo; It was kind of off and on. Sometimes it seemed like Yixing didn&rsquo;t even realize he existed and other times he paid so much attention to Jongdae it made him blush&mdash;a lot. An embarrassing amount. It had been happening so much recently too.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Are you sure about that?&rdquo; If Jongdae was to answer that question truthfully he would&rsquo;ve had to make a sort of undignified humming noise but he wasn&rsquo;t so sure he wanted to embarrass himself like that in front of Yixing. Not today anyway, not in this moment and especially not when Yixing was moving toward him. </span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">He put his hands over Jongdae&rsquo;s, intertwined their fingers. He pressed their foreheads together. A smile spread across his lips and then all Jongdae could focus on were his lips, bright and rosy and plump and parted.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He breathed out and their lips meet briefly. The contact was too brief but even so Jongdae could feel where Yixing&rsquo;s lips had been seconds before. He wanted to feel them again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; He leaned in and, to his disappointment, Yixing pulled back.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;How about we start small?&rdquo;</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Hn?&rdquo; Jongdae asked stupidly, lifting his eyes from Yixing&rsquo;s lips. He was looking at Jongdae and it was one of those looks that made him feel like they were the only two people in the world. It was one of the looks that Yixing gave him sometimes, the ones that made his heat pound.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Be my guest at Baekhyun&rsquo;s ball.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a question but even if it was Jongdae wouldn&rsquo;t have said no.</span>
 
<span style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo; He accepted and was rewarded with one last kiss. Yixing bid him good night. Jongdae watched him go. He hurried to his own rooms. The sooner he slept, the sooner tomorrow would come and hopefully, the sooner he&rsquo;d get another kiss.</span>

for: <lj user=""holeinmyface"" />: &quot;uhm, then, xing the guitar boy who meet jongdae the piano boy!&quot;</blockquote>
<lj-cut text=""304"">
<b>304</b>

<i>Right on time</i>, Yixing thought when he heard the soft murmur of the piano. He leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes, listening to the smooth melody.

That night was a pop mashup. The music started out slow, cautious. Little by little, the tempo increased. Before the chorus of the first song began, the song changed, the tempo quickened. The song after that was slower with the notes held longer, the pressure from the pianist&rsquo;s fingers softer. After a minute or so the pace began to quicken again. The transitions were fluid and well executed. Yixing would have probably missed them if he hadn&rsquo;t been listening so closely.

He could picture the swiftness in which the pianist&rsquo;s hands slid across the keys. The haphazard manner in which his limbs move and the chilling accuracy in which those fingers hit the keys. It made Yixing&rsquo;s fingers ache and yearn for his guitar.

Most nights he gave in. Holding his guitar close, Yixing played along with the songs he knew, improvising during unfamiliar parts he didn&rsquo;t recognize. Some days, like today, he held himself back, not wanting to disturb the other boy&rsquo;s practice. Those were the days he sat cross legged on the floor, his eyes closed, his ears open, just listening and enjoying the music that flowed from the third floor music room.

Kim Jongdae was the quiet boy who took most of the same classes as Yixing. He was a junior, like Yixing, and even though they had entered the university at around the same time, Yixing didn&rsquo;t really know much about the other boy. Truthfully, until two months prior Yixing had no idea who Kim Jongdae was or that the boy even existed. All he really known was that there was a boy who played the Chopin and pop songs in room 304 of the music building at one in the morning.

The only reason Yixing knew his name and year was because he had seen the boy walk into the room 304. The next day he had seen the exact same face walking into Yixing&rsquo;s music appreciation class, math class, and history class. He had asked Luhan about the boy and, not without disbelief&mdash;&ldquo;What do you mean who is he? He&rsquo;s been sitting behind you for the past <i>two</i> months, and he&rsquo;s in practically all your classes!&ldquo;&mdash;and extensive teasing, Luhan had told him.

Yixing had a bad memory when it comes to faces. He had a bad memory when it came to names and numbers and directions, he was not afraid to admit it, but when it came to music he changed. Music was part of him, something he couldn&rsquo;t live without. It seemed to be engraved into his being.

Forgetting how to play the guitar would have been like forgetting how to breathe or forgetting how to walk. He couldn&rsquo;t forget that day, almost half a year ago, when he had first heard the piano in room 304. He didn&rsquo;t know the name of the song, even now he doesn&rsquo;t, but he remembered the impression it had given him. It had been beautiful and that, in Yixing&rsquo;s opinion, was all he needed to know. To him, it was all that mattered.

Jongdae owned 304 like Yixing owned 305. He played the piano at ungodly hours of the night, just as Yixing did on his guitar. He played with skill, but more than that, he played with passion and that was all that mattered to Yixing.




It was two hours before Yixing heard the knock on the door.

&ldquo;Hyung! Are you in there?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah, hold on!&rdquo; Yixing called, placing his guitar into it&rsquo;s case and strapping it on his back. When he opened the door Jongdae stared back at him, his messenger bag slung across his shoulders and his hair hidden under baseball cap. Every time Yixing saw him, he seemed to have a perpetual smile on his face. That night was no different.

That day, when Yixing had asked Luhan about Jongdae, Luhan had taken it upon himself to introduce the two of them. (&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to forgive this one. He forgets his own name sometimes.&rdquo;) Jongdae had already known who Yixing was, which wasn&rsquo;t really a surprise if they really did have most of the classes together.

When Yixing had complimented Jongdae on his piano skills. Jongdae had returned the compliment which surprised Yixing because he had never thought that the other boy actually heard him, or listened. It was a stupid thought, but the thought had simply never crossed his mind before. It had felt a little weird&mdash;not the compliment, the idea that someone actually listened to what he played at the unholy hour of one in the morning.

Two nights after Luhan&rsquo;s introduction, Jongdae had knocked on the door to 305 and it has been that way ever since.

&ldquo;Are you finished?&rdquo; Jongdae asked, peering into the small room.

&ldquo;Yeah, I was just packing up.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; Yixing watched as Jongdae&rsquo;s smile grew wider. &ldquo;Then do you want to come over to my place to watch a movie? Baekhyun&rsquo;s not there...so...&rdquo; It was hard not to notice the blush that spreads across the other boy&rsquo;s cheeks and ears. &ldquo;Um...it&rsquo;s gonna be quiet...?&rdquo; He gave a nervous laugh. It seemed like the other boy was always either blushing, laughing or stumbling over his words.

&ldquo;Sure, why not?&rdquo; Yixing smiled at the way Jongdae&rsquo;s eyes lit up and his lips pulled into a full smile.

&ldquo;Really? Cool!&rdquo;

As Yixing got to know Jongdae, he realised that he liked the other boy. Not just the music he played, but liked Jongdae himself. Jongdae was quiet, but could got lively and energetic when he spoke about his interests. They had the same sense of humour and liked most of the same things so they had become fast friends. There were still some things that Yixing did not understand about the other boy, like why he blushed at everything and seemed perpetually nervous, but, Yixing thought, that would come in time.

Zhang Yixing is that weird kid in class that sits near the back by the window with that far off gaze in his eyes. He&rsquo;s the loner who sits in the courtyard and the library and the quad with a guitar in his lap, paying no attention to what&rsquo;s going on around him. He&rsquo;s the guy that locks himself up in the third floor music room every evening and doesn&rsquo;t leave until four in the morning. Sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t leave at all and Luhan or Kris has to kick him out or else he&rsquo;ll be there all day. 

He&rsquo;s also the boy Jongdae has a massive crush on.

&ldquo;Then do you want to come over to my place to watch a movie? Baekhyun&rsquo;s not there...so...um...it&rsquo;s gonna be quiet...?&rdquo; <i>Quiet</i>? He inwardly groans. <i>Smooth Jongdae</i>, real<i>smooth</i>. He wants to find a little hole, jump in it and never come out because Yixing must think he&rsquo;s some kind of loser, if he doesn&rsquo;t think that already.

Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t even know why he tries. Until two months ago, Yixing hadn&rsquo;t even known he existed, even though they had had so many classes together. Even though Jongdae always chose the seat closest to Yixing, somewhere he could stare all he wanted and never get caught. 

It hadn&rsquo;t come as a shock when Luhan, Yixing&rsquo;s friend had introduced them&mdash;introduced Yixing to Jongdae, but it had hurt, a lot. It hurt more than he had thought it would, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense because Jongdae already knew Yixing didn&rsquo;t care for Jongdae like Jongdae cared for him.

It was two and a half years ago, in their freshman year, when it all started. It had been late in the evening and Jongdae had been on his way to club. He had hear the older boy before he saw him, heard the soft melodies of his guitar echoing through the halls. Jongdae had followed it and it had led him to Yixing&rsquo;s favorite third floor music room. 

It was hot that day and the door had been open. Yixing sat on the bench by the open window, playing some tune Jongdae vaguely thought he knew. It was beautiful, and sad and only added to the etherealness of the boy, his hair swaying in the late autumn breeze, his frame hunched over an electric acoustic, fingers flying over the neck, a somber expression marring his features.

Jongdae hadn&rsquo;t fallen in love with Yixing that night. He hadn&rsquo;t even <i>known</i> the boy. He had known who Yixing was&mdash;<i>everyone</i> in the freshman class knew the guy who slept through all of Mr. Shim&rsquo;s classes and still passed with straight A&rsquo;s, but after that night, it was that image that stayed with Jongdae. He knew Yixing as the pretty boy who locked himself in room 305.

***

&ldquo;Sorry if it&rsquo;s a bit messy.&rdquo; Jongdae says, turning on the lights. His apartment&rsquo;s small and a bit cramped. It&rsquo;s only Baekhyun and him in there, sometimes Chanyeol or Kyungsoo or Joonmyun but most of the time all three at once so normally there&rsquo;s always crap everywhere. Tonight, though, it&rsquo;s spotless. He made sure of it before leaving and made Baekhyun promise to not touch anything while he was gone.

&ldquo;Do you want anything to drink?&rdquo; He asks, setting his bag on the small dining table.

&ldquo;Umm&hellip;do you have coke?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He smiles. 
 
They pick an action movie, and twenty minutes in Jongdae can&rsquo;t bring himself to pay attention any longer. He sits cross legged on one side of the couch with Yixing on the other. He looks so into the movie Jongdae can&rsquo;t help the small smile that spreads on his lips.

Jongdae had fallen in love with Yixing slowly. So slowly that he doesn&rsquo;t really know how it happened or the exact moment he knew he was doomed. Yixing with his guitar. Yixing asleep with his head down. Yixing dropping down from wherever far off land he had been in and coming back down to earth. Over the past two years Jongdae has watched and listened, falling harder and harder, deeper and deeper in love with the weirdo who didn&rsquo;t even know his name. 

He almost can&rsquo;t believe that the same guy is sitting in his apartment, across from him. It&rsquo;s hard not to stare, and Jongdae forgets to hide it.

&ldquo;What do you keep staring at?&rdquo; The question comes as a surprise and it takes a while for Jongdae to realize it&rsquo;s even been asked.

&ldquo;N-n-nothing!&rdquo; He stammers, his face flaming red from embarrassment. Of all the times to get caught! He can feel his ears burning. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t staring at anything&hellip;&rdquo; He draws his knees up, curling into a ball, hiding his face. He wants to die.

&ldquo;Jongdae&hellip;&rdquo; He hears and shakes his head. <i>He wants to die</i>. What does he do now? Yixing must think he&rsquo;s such a freak. Why did he even invite him over? This had been a horrible idea!

&ldquo;Jongdae&rdquo; Yixing says again. He&rsquo;s closer, much closer and when he touches Jongdae&rsquo;s shoulder Jongdae can&rsquo;t keep it in any longer. 

&ldquo;<i>Ilikeyouokay</i>?&rdquo; He sputters. &ldquo;I-I just&hellip;&rdquo; He turns his head to the side, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I just like you&hellip;&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a pause before Yixing speaks.

&ldquo;Was that it?&rdquo; 

<i>Was that it</i>? Jongdae stiles and then lifts his head, his eyes on Yixing. <i>Was that it</i>? runs through his head, over and over.

&ldquo;Wha&hellip;&rdquo; Jongdae says quietly, too quiet for Yixing to catch.

&ldquo;I like you too.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s amusement in Yixing&rsquo;s voice and then Jongdae understands.

<i>Not like that</i>. He wants to say. <i>I don&rsquo;t like you</i> like that, but the words get stuck in his throat and Yixing&rsquo;s attention is turned back to the stupid movie.

Jongdae is heartbroken. It feels like someone has just punched him in the gut and he can&rsquo;t breathe. He blinks and there are tears forming in his eyes. He wills them away but they don&rsquo;t listen so he buries his face again and tries not to make any sound.

&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Yixing tugs on his arm and Jongdae shakes his head, wiping the tears on his sleeve. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s stupid.&rdquo; He is so <i>stupid</i>. Two months ago, Yixing hadn&rsquo;t even known Jongdae <i>existed</i>. Why would he have returned Jongdae&rsquo;s <i>stupid</i> feelings&mdash;

&ldquo;Jongdae,&rdquo; Yixing says and it comes out so <i>gentle</i>.

&ldquo;No. <i>Don&rsquo;t</i>. It&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;&rdquo;

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nothing.&rdquo; Yixing manages to pull one arm free, and then another. &ldquo;Tell me?&rdquo; A hand brushes against Jongdae&rsquo;s cheek, sweeping away the tears.

&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; He starts, &ldquo;not like <i>that</i>. I&hellip;don&rsquo;t like you like that.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s that pause again and Yixing blinks. He breathes out a little laugh.

&ldquo;Jongdae, I <i>like</i> you.&rdquo; He says it slowly, calmly. Jongdae will never understand how he can say that with a straight face. He will never understand how Yixing can be so completely un-flustered, so cool, so unlike Jongdae, who blushes whenever the other boy even looks his way.

Yixing leans in and it&rsquo;s too brief, too light, too <i>sweet</i> to be called a kiss, but that&rsquo;s what it is. &ldquo;Okay?&rdquo; Yixing asks but how can things be even remotely okay? Jongdae nods anyway, waiting for the dizziness to pass. His face is burning and he can&rsquo;t bring himself to face Yixing.

The movie ends and they throw in another and another. Yixing stays without Jongdae having to ask.

<lj-cut text=""it turned into an academy school au; WIP"">
Jongdae is 16 when he is sent to the Academy. The bus drops him along with twenty other new cadets&mdash;<i>plebes</i>&mdash;off at the main entrance where they are herded off into the quad to join the rest of the recruits. They are sorted into groups and made to stand in neat, single file lines under the blazing, late summer sun. Orientation starts at fifteen thirty and Jongdae sits there, staring at the single-haired mole above Commander Gordon&rsquo;s upper lip. He tries not to get too close to the kid standing in front of him.

He doesn&rsquo;t think about how much he already hates the Academy. He doesn&rsquo;t think about the friends he has left behind. He doesn&rsquo;t think about his parents. Not his mother and how betrayed he feels at her for letting call-me-Dav Jungho send him here and definitely not his father.

The physical education is intense. They go through boot camp for the first two weeks and then again at the beginning of every trimester. There&rsquo;s PT in the morning and PT in the afternoon. Saturdays are for clubs, and baseball in the quad. Soccer is at the track. Basketball is in the gym. Sometimes, when the weather is nice enough, kids gather at the courts in the field off the track. Before the academy, sports had never been Jongdae&rsquo;s thing and, he soon learns, will never be his thing so he joins step instead.

In school they are taught about the wars and battles. They are taught combat strategies, and math, and science. They learn about honor and ethics, how to be a good man, and a better soldier. Courses are designed to teach them about teamwork but what Jongdae learns in his first year is to keep secrets. He meets all kinds of people. Some he befriends, skipping classes together then cleaning the bathrooms in the bareks when they get caught.

He sneaks out into town with Baekhyun and Chanyeol on Friday nights. Some nights they wander through the woods behind the academy. Those nights they lay under the stars, just talking and listening, not thinking about what will happen in the morning when Private Lanier makes them scrub the floors of whatever room they haven&rsquo;t already cleaned. They laugh about the stupid things they&rsquo;ve done through the week, the teachers, and the other cadets.

They don&rsquo;t talk about the things that must not be discussed. They don&rsquo;t talk about Chanyeol&rsquo;s parents or how they never visit or call or seem to care. They don&rsquo;t talk about the pills under Baekhyun&rsquo;s mattress or how he sometimes skips breakfast and lunch and dinner. They don&rsquo;t talk about where Jongdae disappears to on Satruday nights or the marks he comes back with the following morning.

Some people Jongdae avoids, and tries to ignore and when they learn to fight, Jongdae learns to defend himself. He&rsquo;s one of the shortest boys in the whole academy. It isn&rsquo;t long before he learns to use it.

The next year is like the first, except he&rsquo;s a year older, with more responsibilities and higher expectations placed upon him. He still hates the Academy, but not so much now that he has friends to share his pain with. After two years the Academy becomes his home. He knows all the hallways and corridors on campus. He becomes familiar with the places hidden from the cameras and where the security guards don&rsquo;t patrol. He gets to meet people he can call friends and for once in his life, Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t feel like the world is crashing down on him.

That all changes in his third year, when the wolf boys come.

***

&ldquo;I mean, what I don&rsquo;t get is why he had to trash my manhood like that.&rdquo; Chanyeol says, following Baekhyun and Jongdae into the auditorium. They sit in the middle with the rest of their class.

&ldquo;What manhood?&rdquo; Baekhyun says and Jongdae almost chocks on his coke laughing.

&ldquo;Damn Baek. That hurt&hellip;&rdquo; Chanyeol places his hand over his chest, his face contorts into something Jongdae thinks makes him looks like he&rsquo;s mildly constipated.

&ldquo;Coming from the guy who still sleeps with a teddy bear.&rdquo; Jongdae says just low enough for the people in the next row to hear. He smiles when he hears the snickers but is a little disappointed when Baekhyun doesn&rsquo;t show any reaction.

It&rsquo;s been months since Jongdae has gotten a reaction other than mild apathy out of the other boy and sometimes Jongdae longed to go back to their plebeian days, where they were just getting to know each other and Baekhyun didn&rsquo;t quite how to deal with him. At least Chanyeol humored him, Jongdae thinks, settling into his seat.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know, Mr. Teddy&rsquo;s a <i>panda</i> bear.&rdquo; Baekhyun corrects, &ldquo;And so what? At least I don&rsquo;t paint my toe nails, and wear fruity ass perfumes.&rdquo;

&ldquo;That was one night&mdash;&rdquo;

&ldquo;<i>One</i>?&rdquo; Chanyeol buts in, &ldquo;What about that time when in October when you&mdash;&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why do I even bother to defend you?&rdquo; He punches Chanyeol on the arm, &ldquo;I meant the nail painting. And besides, you can&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t like Passion Fruit Paradise.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay, I think we get it. None of you are men.&rdquo; Kyungsoo says when he turns. Jongdae can hear muffled snickers from more than a couple guys sitting around them. &ldquo;Now can you <i>shut up</i>? It&rsquo;s starting.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes <i>mom</i>.&rdquo; Jongdae mutters as the principal walks up on stage. The national anthem starts playing and they rise, hands over hearts, to take the pledge.

It is Monday morning of the first day of school. As per tradition, the whole school is packed into the auditorium for the annual school wide welcome back assembly. They are split by rank, year and class. Cows are placed in the middle with Yearlings and Plebeians on either side. The Firsties, the seniors, in their newly pressed dress whites take up the first couple rows with the faculty and guest speakers.

The principal launches into his start of the year welcome speech and Jongdae, having already heard this twice before, only half listens. He reclines in his seats and lets his eyes wander. He looks to the plebes, the newbies, reeking of youth and a nervous haze of excitement only [newbies]. They sit with their backs straight, their attention never wandering from the principal, or the speaker after him.

Yearlings are never interesting so Jongdae moves on to the Firsties. He spots the back of Joonmyun&rsquo;s head first, and then Minseok all the way on the other side of the auditorium. Beside him are people Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t know but he has an idea of who they maybe and he is proven right when they, along with their instructor are called up on stage and introduced by the principal.

&ldquo;International students from China&rdquo;, the principal calls them, but the cadets know them by another name, the <i>wolves</i>. Every year a set of them comes to study at the Academy. They are from all over, the Americas, Europe, Asia. Last year, was Brazil, and the year before that was Canada. The whole program is to teach the cadets about the international community or something like that. Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t really know. He&rsquo;s never listened to the whole speech.

Nobody really knows how the name came about but Jongdae thinks that it adequately describes dynamic in which the international students operate. They stick to their pack and rarely venturing off on their on their own without the permission of the alpha&mdash;their Captain. They didn&rsquo;t shun the Academy cadets&mdash;what would be the point of the program if they did?&mdash;but work together more often than not.

There&rsquo;s a rumor that the first international students who studied at the Academy had each had tattoos of wolves somewhere on their body and the name had just stuck, being passes down over the years, becoming a tradition (along with the tradition of the wolves getting tattoos at the end of their stay) in the way most of the Academy&rsquo;s traditions come about.

Jongdae had never really paid much attention to them. They a new pack arrived every year and at the end of the year they bid them farewell. The packs are primarily formed of Firsties and occasionally Cows who like to think of themselves as firsties, so Jongdae has never had that much interaction with them in the past two years. Sitting in his seat, he doesn&rsquo;t think this year will be any different.

<lj-cut text=""chen trolling kris"">
<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">They are at the aquarium and Kris gets stuck with the idiot couple. He doesn&rsquo;t know how it happens, one minute they&rsquo;re a group of twelve, the next minute everyone has scattered, leaving him third wheel to Yixing and Jongdae.</span>

Kris doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with Jongdae and Yixing holding hands. He doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with them touching each other whenever they have the chance which is usually every two seconds. He doesn&rsquo;t even have a problem with them kissing or making out, granted he not be in the general vicinity when it takes place.

Kris does, however, have a problem with Yixing and Jongdae pointing at all the little fish and comparing their &ldquo;cuteness&rdquo; to each other (their words, not his). Kris has a problem with Jongdae and Yixing calling each other by their inane nicknames. He has a problem with the two of them doing aegyo right in front of him, especially when he&rsquo;s trying to eat.

It&rsquo;s not that Kris does it on purpose. He doesn&rsquo;t mean to. The muscles in his face contort on their own. It&rsquo;s a reflex to the disgustingly high amount of unabashed cheese and sap emanating from the two guys in front of him.

It&rsquo;s not until Jongdae says:
&ldquo;Hyung, please fix your face. You don&rsquo;t wanna scare the fishes.&rdquo;
that Kris even realizes he&rsquo;s doing it.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>***</b></div>

&ldquo;Gege look.&rdquo; Jongdae runs to Yixing, holding out his hand. &ldquo;I have a booboo.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing there. Kris knows because he was there when Jongdae accidentally scuffed his hand on the edge of the dresser. He had hissed, waving his hand about and Kris had asked him if he was okay. Jongdae had nodded and they had gone back to moving furniture.

Yixing takes his hand and Kris <i>knows</i> that Yixing knows that there&rsquo;s nothing there but, much to Kris&rsquo;s chagrin, he plays along anyway.

&ldquo;Oh our poor Jongdae.&rdquo; He says and Jongdae nods, eyes wide, a pout on his lips.

&ldquo;Kiss it and make it better.&rdquo; Jongdae&rsquo;s says, his voice dripping with false innocence. It&rsquo;s more than a little disturbing, almost frightening to see Jongdae act like this and with Kris&rsquo;s <i>best friend </i>no less. It doesn&rsquo;t make it better that Yixing is going along with all of this, like he always does.

Jongdae gets his kiss, a pat on the cheek as well as a grope on his ass that Kris really wishes he had the ability to unsee. He turns around before Kris has a chance to fix his expression or look away.

&ldquo;Maybe Kris needs a kiss too. His face doesn&rsquo;t look so good.&rdquo; He says and Kris blanches. He can feel the smugness behind those innocent eyes.

At least they aren&rsquo;t doing this in public, Kris thinks. That&rsquo;s really all he can hope for at this point.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>***</b></div>

<i>They&rsquo;re being normal for once</i>, Kris thinks when he walks into the living room. Yixing and Jongdae are in the kitchen cooking because Kris refuses to acknowledge all the others things one might do when one is evil and alone with one&rsquo;s boyfriend. It looks normal enough, Kris decides, flopping onto the couch and turning on the TV.

It&rsquo;s the minute he gets comfortable&mdash;and Kris <i>knows</i> Jongdae has planned for this exact minute&mdash;that he hears a moan. It&rsquo;s followed by:

&ldquo;Jongdae <i>stop</i>.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But Yixingie hyung doesn&rsquo;t it feel good?&rdquo;

&ldquo;<i>Jongdae</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Yixing laughs.

&ldquo;Hyung you&rsquo;re so cute, especially when I touch you here&mdash;&rdquo;

And that&rsquo;s when Kris decides that <i>no he really doesn&rsquo;t want to see where this is going</i> and abruptly leaves.


(&ldquo;Quit it.&rdquo; Yixing lightly smacks Jongdae&rsquo;s wet hands away from his neck. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be washing the vegetables, not me. Now get back to work. We have to get this done. They&rsquo;ll be here in an hour.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes hyung.&rdquo; He says in a sing song voice, walking back to his place in front of the sink.

&ldquo;Oh, where did Kris go this time?&rdquo; Yixing asks when he doesn&rsquo;t see his roommate on the couch. &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t told him your parents are coming over tonight and we need the apartment.&rdquo; Jongdae shrugs.

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to be around tonight.&rdquo;

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not?&rdquo; Yixing turns to his boyfriend and throws him a questioning look. &ldquo;Did he tell you?&rdquo;

Jongdae smiles, &ldquo;I just have a feeling.&rdquo;)

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>***</b></div>

&ldquo;Hey, Yixing how&mdash;&rdquo;

&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; Yixing presses his index to his lips. &ldquo;I just got him to sleep,&rdquo; he whispers. Jongdae is curled on the couch. His head is pillowed on Yixing&rsquo;s lap, Yixing&rsquo;s hand rubbing circles on his back. For a moment Kris just stares at the two of them. Jongdae is evil, Kris is pretty sure of that, but when he sleeps he looks less of a monster.

&ldquo;You&hellip;really like him don&rsquo;t you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a question because Kris has eyes. He can see the tender look Yixing gives his sleeping boyfriend. He sees the soft, indulgent smile that spreads across Yixing&rsquo;s lips when he Jongdae mumbles something in his sleep, shifting on the couch so he is closer to Yixing.

Yixing smiles. Nodding, he says &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s so sincere Kris has to look away. He scratches the back of the head, ignoring the blush that is spreading on his face (no one other than Yixing could say something like that with a straight face).

&ldquo;Just&mdash;&rdquo; Kris starts. By now his face is flushed red, and he looks everywhere but his best friend.

&ldquo;Hn?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Justbecarefulalright?&rdquo; It comes out in one long breath. Slower he says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see you get hurt. Both of you.&rdquo; He adds the last part with a glance to Jongdae.

&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo; Kris says and he means it. If Jongdae would never let him live this down if he knew.

<b>genre &amp; rating:</b> smut &amp; NC17(?)

<lj-cut text=""cut to the story"">

Yixing grits his teeth. His grip on Jongdae&rsquo;s hair tightens as a scorching heat pools down just below his stomach. His breaths become shorter, quicker. Jongdae&rsquo;s hold on his hips strengthens, keeping Yixing steady, upright. Jongdae&rsquo;s lips clasp around his hardening cock, his cheeks hollowing and Yixing feels like he&rsquo;s being drawn out, piece by fucking piece. Biting his lips, Yixing tries to stifle the groan and he comes, hot and think into Jongdae&rsquo;s mouth.
 
Through half narrowed eyes he sees Jongdae. Sees his cheeks expand as his mouth fills with cum, <i>Yixings&rsquo;</i> <i>cum</i>. He watches Jongdae&rsquo;s swollen lips slip off his cock, pink tongue hidden under the white coating swipes over his lips. A white trail dribbles down the corner of Jongdae&rsquo;s lips, trickles down his chin and just the thought of it almost makes Yixing hard again. He mutters a quiet apology for not giving a proper warning. His thumb swipes against Jongdae&rsquo;s lips in an attempt to wipe them off, but Jongdae brushes his hand away and Yixing doesn&rsquo;t think too much about that look his eyes. The one that tells him that Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t want to be here, never has, and probably never will.
 
Leaning against the bookshelf, Yixing watches the other boy gather his things. Like usual, Jongdae leaves first and it&rsquo;s only when he&rsquo;s gone that Yixing allows himself to relax. He slumps down to the floor, runs his hands through his hair, an exasperated sound escapes his lips. He stays like that, his face buried in his hands, until his phone goes off. It&rsquo;s Luhan wondering where the hell he is. Classes are about to start.
 
It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be like this, not at first. Yixing hadn&rsquo;t really been thinking all those months ago when he had first proposed this stupid idea. He hadn&rsquo;t thought about the outcome or the hostility that would further develop between Jongdae and him. He should have thought this through dammit&mdash;he was number one in his grade&mdash;half the time that is. He should have been <i>smarter</i> about this.
 
He would have been, he thinks, if the only thoughts that had been circulating in his mind at the time weren&rsquo;t of how much he liked the younger boy red-faced and embarrassed. About how delicious Jongdae&rsquo;s lips looked or about how hot he would have looked flushed red and breathless under Yixing. Yixing is more than a little pissed that in the past two months of their little bet they hadn&rsquo;t gone farther than blowjobs in the mystery section of the library.
 
It&rsquo;s not until halfway through class, when last week&rsquo;s exams are passed back, the Yixing remembers why he doesn&rsquo;t just end it all. It&rsquo;s when Jongdae gets his papers back and Yixing sees the grin on the other boy&rsquo;s lips that he knows he doesn&rsquo;t have the power to end this. He&rsquo;s not a selfish person&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t think he is, but when Jongdae gets involved, everything changes. It&rsquo;s not that Yixing doesn&rsquo;t want to let go. It&rsquo;s more like he can&rsquo;t let go. He can&rsquo;t cancel their bet and as much as he hates how things have progressed he doesn&rsquo;t <i>wants</i> to. Like this, Jongdae is his. In a messed up way, Jongdae is <i>his</i>, and Yixing doesn&rsquo;t want to let him go.
 
 

 
&ldquo;Second again?&rdquo; Luhan says when he sees Yixing&rsquo;s exam. &ldquo;So close.&rdquo; He pats Yixing on the back, &ldquo;Maybe next time.&rdquo; Out of the corner of his eye, Yixing sees Jongdae turn in their direction.
 
&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says, turning to face Jongdae, &ldquo;maybe.&rdquo; He watches as the faint blush spreads across the other boy&rsquo;s cheeks. He loves the way Jongdae&rsquo;s lower lip protrudes in a slight pout. It&rsquo;s something the boy always does when he&rsquo;s thinking or nervous, Yixing hasn&rsquo;t figured it all out yet, but he doesn&rsquo;t think Jongdae knows he&rsquo;s doing it. It&rsquo;s involuntary, like the way Jongdae tilts his head to the side when he&rsquo;s trying to figure something out, or that thing he does with his hands when he&rsquo;s bored.
 
It&rsquo;s involuntary like the way his legs straighten and his toes curl when he&rsquo;s about to come. He mutters Yixing&rsquo;s name over and over. His voice comes out high, ragged and rough. Jongdae clutches on to Yixing so tight, like Yixing is his lifeline and Yixing loves it. He loves knowing that he&rsquo;s the only thing on Jongdae&rsquo;s mind, loves his name on Jongdae&rsquo;s tongue. He loves knowing that he can make Jongdae go crazy like that, that he has the same effect on Jongdae that Jongdae has on him.
 
&ldquo;Earth to Yixing!&rdquo; Yixing blinks and turns to his friends.
 
&ldquo;Hm? What?&rdquo; He says dumbly. Kris and Luhan share a look&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been doing that a lot recently, and Yixing doesn&rsquo;t think much of it.
 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get to you okay?&rdquo; Luhan says tentatively and Yixing almost laughs. It&rsquo;s already too late for that, he thinks, but he can tell Luhan is worried so he nods and brushes off his friends&rsquo; concerns. Throwing one last glance at Jongdae, Yixing follows Luhan and Kris out of the classroom as the lunch bell rings.

It takes about ten seconds for Jongdae to slap Yixing&rsquo;s hand away. They&rsquo;re in the gym, crowded on and around the stage. The sound isn&rsquo;t loud but Jongdae can feel the eyes on them.
 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch my hair.&rdquo; He hisses, barely glancing at Yixing.
 
&ldquo;But it looks really nice today.&rdquo; That gets Jongdae&rsquo;s attention. He looks like crap and it&rsquo;s all Yixing&rsquo;s fault but before Jongdae can say anything Yixing&rsquo;s hands are on him again. This time it&rsquo;s his neck. Gentle fingers trace down his skin, tugging at the collar of his shirt and Jongdae promptly removes them before they get any further.
 
&ldquo;What the hell.&rdquo; He spits out. <i>Not</i> <i>here</i>. He can feel the heat building in his face. Before Yixing can say anything Luhan&mdash;<i>Jongdae&rsquo;s</i> <i>savior</i>&mdash;drags him away. <i>Thank God.</i>
 
&ldquo;Are you <i>trying</i> to get punched?&rdquo; Luhan chastises, pinching his friend&rsquo;s arm. Jongdae tries not to show how delighted he is when he hears Yixing hiss in pain.
 
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything though.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;What is <i>wrong</i> with you lately?&rdquo; That is Jongdae wants to ask. His fingers go to the spot below his collar where Yixing had marked his skin that morning. He had bitten <i>hard</i>; the spot is still sore and sensitive. It isn&rsquo;t the only mark Yixing had given him that morning and Jongdae can feel the blush deepen when he thinks about the locations of the others.
 
&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Jongdae snaps out of it. &ldquo;Oh, yeah. I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; He says turning to Chanyeol.
 
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what his problem is these days.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not the only one. Yixing has been acting weird&mdash;weirder than usual that is. He keeps touching Jongdae and Jongdae wouldn&rsquo;t mind if it wasn&rsquo;t in front of so many people. Half the time Yixing opens his mouth it&rsquo;s to tease Jongdae, the other half it&rsquo;s to compliment him, even when the compliment isn&rsquo;t warranted or, in most cases even true.
 
From everyone else&rsquo;s perspective it looks like Yixing is trying to pick a fight. It&rsquo;s widely known that the two boys hate each other. They&rsquo;re always competing with each other in sports and academics. When one boy wins one competition, the other wins another. Nowadays though, it&rsquo;s Jongdae who is number one.
 
In their freshmen year, the two had got into a huge argument that resulted in a fight. They had both gotten suspended and word had traveled fast around school. From that day on, in the eyes on their peers, they were enemies but that isn&rsquo;t entirely true though. They aren&rsquo;t enemies; at least Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t think so. He hates Yixing but it&rsquo;s for entirely different reasons than what most of his classmates can come up with.
 
Jongdae hates just about everything concerning Yixing. He hates the casual way Yixing walks, and talks, the startling evenness of his voice and that dazed look in his eyes, especially when they&rsquo;re turned on him. The way Yixing puckers his lips when he talks as well as the sound of his laughter pisses Jongdae off to no end. Jongdae hates the way Yixing&rsquo;s eyes crinkle when he smiles, and the deformation in his cheek that always makes itself known when he smiles&mdash;Jongdae has no idea how the hell people can think it&rsquo;s <i>cute&mdash;</i>their words, not his.
 
On the list of Things-That-Make-Jongdae-Want-to-Kick-Yixing-in-the-Balls is the older boy&rsquo;s height&mdash;why did the stupid people get to be the taller ones? It was bad enough that whenever Jongdae looked at the older boy, his face turned into an over ripe tomato, even worse that when they touched, or were close enough to touch, his heart felt like it was going to give out. Jongdae didn&rsquo;t need the embarrassment of being the <i>shorter</i> one. He&rsquo;s read Chanyeol&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s private Manwha collection&mdash;the one she keeps hidden in the top drawer of her desk so her mom won&rsquo;t find it. He knows how these things turn out and he&rsquo;s not entirely sure he wants it that way.
 
Jongdae hates Yixing for what Yixing does to him, but what he hates the most is that the other boy doesn&rsquo;t care or seem to realize this. He doesn&rsquo;t know which one it is, but they might as well be the same. Neither one gets him any closer to what he really wants.
 
For all Yixing watches&mdash;and Jongdae knows he watches him, the whole <i>school</i> knows Yixing watches him&mdash;Yixing can&rsquo;t seem to see the uncertainty in every decision Jongdae makes or how much it frustrates him. He&rsquo;s only started to figure out what these feels are, he doesn&rsquo;t need Yixing&rsquo;s lips or that wanting look he gives Jongdae before he drags him to the mystery section to further complicate things.
 
Life would be so much easier if they were truly enemies and Jongdae could hate Yixing freely without his stupid heart getting in the way.
 
From Jongdae&rsquo;s perspective, Yixing is being childish, but then again, so was he. Yixing refuses to vacate from his seemingly permanent residence in Jongdae&rsquo;s mind and whether he knows it or not, Jongdae won&rsquo;t let him get away with it. So he ignores the older boy. Turns his head when he knows Yixing&rsquo;s is staring and pretends he doesn&rsquo;t hear when Yixing speaks. They are petty little things, but Jongdae is more than willing to be a little petty when it comes to Yixing. At least it gets the other boy to notice him.
 
He glances at Yixing. The older boy is sitting on the stage steps laughing at something one of his friends said. Jongdae nibbles on his lower lip, his eyes tracing over the way Yixing&rsquo;s back arcs when he goes to stretch, at how his top lifts up exposing the waistband of his boxers for all the world to see.
 
&ldquo;Idiot.&rdquo; Jongdae mutters and it comes out softer than he intends. He huffs, hiding his head in between his legs, not sitting up until the heat dissipates from his cheeks.
 

***
 

The mystery section is slightly darker than the rest of the library and Jongdae kind of likes it. It&rsquo;s not dark <i>dark</i>, but the lights overhead are noticeably dimmer than the ones in fiction and reference sections. It sets the mood, makes it feel romantic-<i>ish</i> even though Jongdae knows all Yixing wants is somewhere to put his cock.
 
He will never admit this and forever deny it if asked, but Jongdae likes sucking cock. He likes the tangy taste of it, the tartness of sweat on skin, and the power it gives him over Yixing. He sees that look in Yixing&rsquo;s eyes, sees the lust in them, the desire for <i>him</i> and it drives him mad with excitement. Jongdae licks his lips, his mouth pooling with saliva. Leaning in, he mouths damp kisses on Yixing&rsquo;s erection through the soft fabric of his boxers. The corners of his lips curl up when he feels the shudder that runs through Yixing&rsquo;s body. He traces the outline, teasing small gasps out of the older boy.
 
After a while Jongdae takes pity on him and peels his boxers away. Yixing&rsquo;s cock springs out and Jongdae almost moans at the sight of it. He litters wet kisses on the tip, makes his way down to the length of it and then back up. Saliva drips down his tongue, collecting on the head then trickling down. He licks it off, eyes flash up taking in Yixing&rsquo;s expression. His face is screwed up, lips parted and Jongdae enjoys the moan that escapes when he presses his lips on pink tip. He sucks and licks until it&rsquo;s swollen and red.
 
Yixing&rsquo;s cock is hot in Jongdae&rsquo;s mouth and it makes Jongdae dizzy with desire. It&rsquo;s hard and thick and for a second Jongdae just keeps it there, lightly sucking, relishing in the salty sweetness of the hardened flesh. He pulls it out slowly, scraping the head on his teeth, enjoying how Yixing&rsquo;s fingers tug at his hair. He does this over and over, each time going deeper and deeper, until his mouth is full and he&rsquo;s taken in all he can. A small content hum vibrates through his lips and Jongdae has to put a hand to Yixing&rsquo;s hip to keep him still. He challenges himself to go further.
 
Jongdae knows when Yixing is ready. It&rsquo;s the way Yixing&rsquo;s grip tightens around the locks of his hair, the way his hips buck forward, pushing more of himself into Jongdae&rsquo;s mouth, rocking back and forth in sync with Jongdae, their pace quickening with every thrust. Yixing makes these soft noises and Jongdae closes his eyes, listening, lips closing over the head of Yixing&rsquo;s cock, sucking harder and harder, tongue pressed to the sensitive tip, licking. He comes in Jongdae&rsquo;s mouth and Jongdae sucks it out of him. With his tongue pressed on the slit of the head, lapping, swallowing until Yixing is dry. When Jongdae lets go his lips are puckered and pink. Yixing&rsquo;s breathe comes out ragged and Jongdae counts it as an accomplishment. He runs his tongue across Yixing&rsquo;s softening cock, kissing, calming him down, bringing him back.
 
Jongdae hums when he feels Yixing&rsquo;s fingers threading through his hair. This is the part Jongdae hates. The after. It&rsquo;s not that Jongdae hates being touched, he yearns for it. Wants it, especially now that he&rsquo;s hard and needy, but not like this. Tonight, however, he&rsquo;s in a good mood so he keeps his eyes closed and starts counting down from ten.
 
For ten long seconds he lets Yixing fondle his hair and stroke his cheek. His eyes blink open when Yixing&rsquo;s thumb runs across his lips, is still as Yixing&rsquo;s pushes his way into his mouth. His thumb comes out wet and sticky with a mixture of saliva and small traces of cum. Yixing leans in, and it&rsquo;s not until their noses are almost touching that Jongdae realizes where this is going. He turns his head to the side so Yixing&rsquo;s lips press against his cheek. Undeterred the older boy trails kisses down his neck and Jongdae shifts so he&rsquo;s sitting on his ass instead of his knees.
 
When ten seconds passes, Jongdae starts over. He leans into Yixing&rsquo;s touch, moaning when Yixing&rsquo;s other hand envelops against his erection. He bites his lip as Yixing gnaws on the spot just below above his collarbone. It&rsquo;s almost painful to pull away but when Yixing kisses the corners of his lips Jongdae stops at two. He turns away.
 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; his voice is barely there.
 
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Yixing sighs down his neck. The frustrations, the lust is all there but Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t expect the exhaustion he finds in Yixing&rsquo;s voice. He doesn&rsquo;t know why. It&rsquo;s not the first time they&rsquo;ve had this conversation. It usually ends with one of them&mdash;Jongdae&mdash;storming out.
 
&ldquo;Is that really all you care about?&rdquo; Yixing asks when Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t answer. He pulls back, anger in his voice. This is what Jongdae is used to. Frustration, anger he can handle. &ldquo;Your stupid grades, being <i>number</i> <i>one</i>?&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;I said my <i>parents</i> care about that stuff.&rdquo; Those had been his exact words, Jongdae remembers because he&rsquo;s been repeating them for the past couple months. He had said some other words along with it, when they had agreed upon the terms of their bet, but Yixing never seems to remember. Jongdae tries not to get frustrated but it gets harder and harder every time they have this argument.
 
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the same thing?&rdquo; Yixing runs his hand through his hair. Pulling back, he turns away. Wasn&rsquo;t that just another way of rejecting him? <i>Using his parents?</i> It frustrates Yixing every time he hears it. &ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; He starts, turning back to Jongdae. He runs a hand down the side of the younger boy&rsquo;s face. His gaze goes directly to Jongdae&rsquo;s lips, but he doesn&rsquo;t dare move closer. Jongdae looks pissed off like usual. He has that don&rsquo;t-touch-me expression on his face and Yixing doesn&rsquo;t.
 
&ldquo;Maybe we should just end this.&rdquo; Yixing says but they are empty words. It&rsquo;s not the first time he&rsquo;s said them. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d hate me this much.&rdquo; He laughs&mdash;he fucking <i>laughs</i> and Jongdae thinks <i>this</i> <i>is</i> <i>why</i>. There&rsquo;s no humor in it and the hollowness of it echos in his ears. He lowers his head. His bangs cover his face. He&rsquo;s sick of this. All of this. <i>Why doesn&rsquo;t he get it?</i> <i>Why doesn&rsquo;t he fucking get it?</i> When Yixing makes to stand, Jongdae tugs on his shirt, keeping him still.
 
&ldquo;This is why I hate you.&rdquo; Jongdae mutters and Yixing almost doesn&rsquo;t catch it. &ldquo;You <i>fucking</i> <i>idiot</i>.&rdquo; Jongdae yells, lifting his head, throwing Yixing off guard. &ldquo;How the fuck did you even make it to the top two. Why don&rsquo;t you get it already?&rdquo; What could be worse than confessing, with an erection in the library? Confessing to fucking Zhang Yixing. &ldquo;Why the fuck would I kiss when you don&rsquo;t even like me&hellip;like that&hellip;&rdquo; Jongdae turns his head to the side; he can&rsquo;t face Yixing right now. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kiss me if you don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; He huffs and that&rsquo;s when Yixing gets it. Out of the corner of his eyes Jongdae can see those dusty gears turning in the older boy&rsquo;s head. His eyes narrow then widen in realization. Jongdae wants to punch Yixing so badly right now.
 
Cupping Jongdae&rsquo;s chin, Yixing turns the younger boy so they are facing.
 
&ldquo;How am I supposed to know that when you never say anything.&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious?&rdquo; Jongdae tries to push Yixing&rsquo;s hand away but it doesn&rsquo;t budge. &ldquo;Why would I have agreed to your stupid bet in the first place? Do I look like I need your help to be number one?&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;Wait&mdash;&rdquo; He says, drawing closer. Jongdae can feel his breath on his lips. &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t hate me?&rdquo;
 
&ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo; It comes out barely a whisper. &ldquo;I hate you so much right now.&rdquo; He says and Yixing can&rsquo;t quite believe him, not now, with that pout on his lips and the blush on his cheeks. He gets closer and Jongdae&rsquo;s eyes flick to Yixing&rsquo;s lips then back to his eyes.
 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kiss me if you don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; Jongdae repeats.
 
&ldquo;I mean it.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s meant it for a while now but it&rsquo;s only now that Jongdae lets him, that he believes Yixing. They kiss and it&rsquo;s all tongue and teeth. Feverish, frantic like their relationship these past few months, like their feelings for each other. Half way through Yixing realizes that there&rsquo;s no turning back.
 
They break apart and Yixing savors the dazed [wanting?] look in the younger boy&rsquo;s eyes, the redness of his cheeks, his lips pink and parted, chest raising and falling as he pants. His hair freed from its usual neatness, his clothes disheveled, shirt half undone, sliding off his shoulders and Yixing thinks Jongdae looks the best this way, beautiful, <i>his</i>.
 
&ldquo;Your kissing sucks.&rdquo; Jongdae says more to say something, so Yixing will stop <i>looking</i> at him like that. Yixing breaths out a laugh because <i>of course Jongdae would</i>.
 
&ldquo;Sure about that?&rdquo; Yixing asks, leaning in, tongue flicking across his lips.
 
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo; The word dies on his lips as Yixing presses their lips together in another kiss.

I&#39;m taking requests now for fics. Post one (or how ever many) in the comments and I&#39;ll write a little fic for you. The <b>prompts can be anything</b> (except about character death because just no D&lt; ). I&#39;m taking prompts for this week to write next week, but I&#39;m probably going to be doing this for a while though so no rush^^.

I might do other rare pairs later but for now only Xingdae pls.
<strike>also idk where to link this. I don&#39;t think I can post it on sncj because I haven&#39;t actually written anything yet @_@;; so if you know anyone who would be interested just tell them I guess...</strike>
can&#39;t wait to see what you guys come up with!

Tao/Chanyeol
1732 Words, smutty
Based on My Lady, by EXO because that song is about sex and <lj user=""meowmau"" /> wanted a TaoYeol fic.</div>

<lj-cut text=""My Man"">Pulling the covers back, Chanyeol got out of bed. He made for the bathroom, the soles of his feet padding quietly on the soft carpet floor so as not to wake his sleeping partner. He yawned and stepped under the spray of the shower, letting the hot water warm him and wake him. It soothed the soreness of his muscles and he smiled in memory of the previous night, at how good he had felt. &nbsp;Tao&rsquo;s cock had felt delicious inside of him.

His hand went up to the side of this neck, to his shoulders and then down to his chests. It was like connecting the dots, Chanyeol thought with a chuckle. He loved Tao&rsquo;s lips on him, loved his teeth when they bit into his skin and his tongue, slick and sultry.

Leaning on the side of the glass, he ran a hand down his abdomen. He still remembered the path Tao&rsquo;s mouth had traveled, the detours it had taken and Chanyeol retraced those steps, his hand landing at the base of his cock which had grown hard and hot. He stroked it, a low, cracked moan falling from his parted lips.

Chanyeol loved Tao&rsquo;s body. The two might have been the same height but Chanyeol had always thought Tao was better defined, his limbs&mdash;arms, legs, <i>thighs</i>&mdash;waist, were all thicker than Chanyeol&rsquo;s; stronger too. When Tao climb over him Chanyeol felt the weight of him. He felt the pressure and the heat that radiated from the other.

Chanyeol had never been able to control his body during sex, but Tao restrained him. He held Chanyeol down with his body and made Chanyeol feel put together. As embarrassing as it was to admit, that turned him on to no end. &nbsp;Chanyeol had also never been able to control his voice or what came out his mouth and that was no different when it came to Tao. He had screamed, loud and needy. He would have been apologetic if he didn&rsquo;t think his neighbors were already used to this.

Chanyeol flushed when he caught sight of himself in the mirror and with thoughts of the previous night still fresh in his mind, he came, hot and heavy, into his hand.

<div style=""text-align: center;"">***</div>
Tao was still asleep when Chanyeol exited the bathroom. He threw on a pair of boxers and a shirt before climbing into bed again.

Tao was younger than Chanyeol but most people were often surprised to learn this. Chanyeol&rsquo;s round features, coupled with his large eyes and the way his hair framed his face made him look younger than his age. In contrast, Tao&rsquo;s build as well as the almond shape of his eyes made him look older and unfriendly. It was only when you got to know the boy and spent time with him that you realized just how deceptive his looks were and how little they reflected his personality. Over the years Chanyeol had learned that.

They had started out as a one night stand. They had met in some random club, Tao had taken him home and they had fucked that night, hard and fast, both climaxing more than once, and then once more in the morning. Chanyeol had given Tao his number and a week later they hooked up again.

This went on for months, and Chanyeol doesn&rsquo;t remember exactly when their relationship changed from fuck buddies to friends with benefits. (Although it might&rsquo;ve been around the one time when Tao&rsquo;s friends came over unexpectedly while the two boys were having breakfast. Tao had introduced Chanyeol as a friend, but Chanyeol had left soon after that. Chanyeol&rsquo;s visits to Tao&rsquo;s little apartment became lengthier after that incident.)

It wasn&rsquo;t until a year had passed that Chanyeol noticed Tao&rsquo;s feelings for him. Tao had begun doing things for him. It started small. Tao took an interest in buying him little trinkets, like small toys or cheap pieces of custom jewelry. They were little things too small and random for Chanyeol to even have second thoughts about so he accepted them with a smile.

As time passed Tao had gotten bolder. His gifts became grander and they started to spend more and more time together outs of bed. Tao paid for meals whenever he got the chance, which pissed Chanyeol off at first because <i>he</i> was the hyung. He was supposed to be taking care of the younger boy, not the way around. It was times like that when Tao liked to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; Korean customs and do as he pleased, taking Chanyeol with him.

It had been overwhelming. Tao&rsquo;s feelings for him were growing while Chanyeol felt nothing. He liked Tao. They were good friends, but that&rsquo;s all Chanyeol felt for him and he couldn&rsquo;t <i>force</i> himself to love Tao. Needless to say, he was more than a little relieved when Tao had gone back to China that summer.

Chanyeol had hated himself for the thought but it was how he had felt. He loved Tao, loved him like a friend, but when Tao did things for him or gave him things that implied something more than friendship, it got awkward and uncomfortable. When Tao left, Chanyeol felt like he could breathe again. It gave him time to think.

When it came to relationships Chanyeol couldn&rsquo;t say he had a winning record. He never did too well, preferring hook ups to actual dating. Although he had never cheated, Chanyeol often got bored quickly. He never stuck with more than one person for a couple of months and if they weren&rsquo;t together, he wouldn&rsquo;t have limited himself to just that one person. Only a select few had ever managed to keep his interest for more than a couple months. Tao was one of them, although it had taken a while for Chanyeol to realize that.

The worst thing was that Tao had never forced Chanyeol to do anything he didn&rsquo;t like. He had never pushed when he realized Chanyeol&rsquo;s discomfort and was always the one to apologize and change the subject even though, most of the time, he had done nothing wrong. Tao was sweet and considerate and how fucked up was it that the Chanyeol could only fall for the other boy when he wasn&rsquo;t around?
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
***</div>
&ldquo;Yah,&rdquo; he pulled the covers back. &ldquo;Get up already, its past noon.&rdquo; Chanyeol poked the other boy when he didn&rsquo;t get an answer. &ldquo;Tao?&rdquo; He poked the other boy a second, third a fourth time, all while repeating his name. When Tao groaned, turning to his side with his back facing Chanyeol, he laughed.

&ldquo;Tao,&rdquo; Chanyeol wrapped his arms around the other boy, pressing the two of them together. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sleep all day you know.&rdquo; Chanyeol muttered into his back, drawing small circles on the side of Tao&rsquo;s hips.

Tao groaned again and it sounded a lot like &ldquo;Why not? You do it all the time.&rdquo; He would have gotten a smack for that if Chanyeol hadn&rsquo;t been so focused on leaving little bruises on Tao&rsquo;s back with his mouth. Chanyeol liked to think he knew Tao by now. They had known each other for a little over two years. He knew Tao&rsquo;s body well by now. He knew when Tao was hard and so what if he had just jacked off in the shower? Chanyeol was a healthy twenty-one year old and he had needs. If Tao hadn&rsquo;t given up on sleeping already, he was about to.

&ldquo;Why did you even bother to put on clothes?&rdquo; Tao said when Chanyeol turned him over. From his vantage point, it almost looked like a pout. He hovered above Tao and shrugged, kissing him on the lips. He hadn&rsquo;t really been thinking.

&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Chanyeol asked a little while later, in between kisses. Tao glanced down at his boxers and then up at him. &ldquo;These?&rdquo; Chanyeol asked, finding nothing wrong with wearing boxers while trying to have sex. Tao blinked and Chanyeol gave an exasperated sigh.

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not gonna get in the way. That&rsquo;s what the flappy thing in the front is for.&rdquo; As he tried to explain Tao sat up, pulling him closer. He pulled down Chanyeol&rsquo;s boxers, his hands slowing around the curve of Chanyeol&rsquo;s ass, and took them off.

&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a dumbass sometimes.&rdquo; He said, his smirk turning into laughter when Chanyeol smacked him.

&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; Chanyeol stroked Tao&rsquo;s cock. His lips pulled into a satisfied smirk when Tao let out a small moan.

Chanyeol worked Tao&rsquo;s heated cock in his hand, kneaded it, enjoying the reaction he got from his partner. He loved this. He loved the sounds Tao made during sex. He loved how Tao reacted when Chanyeol worked him with his hands, his mouth and tongue.

Tao put all of himself into everything he did, gave his partner his everything, let them see his all of him, and, admittedly, that had scared Chanyeol at first. Tao came on strong, and that wasn&rsquo;t Chanyeol&rsquo;s style at all, not when it came to <i>this</i>. He had never let himself get too involved, no matter how eager he let others believe he was. He had always kept part of himself hidden, but then Tao had come along and Chanyeol found that he couldn&rsquo;t hide any longer.

He still didn&rsquo;t know how he felt about that. Some days he indulged Tao, let the younger boy do as he wished, while other days, though less frequent, all he wanted to do was lock himself in his room and hide himself away from the world. Chanyeol wasn&rsquo;t as comfortable with letting himself go completely like Tao was&mdash;not just in sex, but in relationships as a whole&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t know if he ever would.

<i>However</i>, Chanyeol smiled, smacking Tao&rsquo;s hand away and pinning him down on bed, he wasn&rsquo;t going to analyze his fears about their relationship in the middle of sex.
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
***</div>
&ldquo;Why are you such a fat ass?&rdquo; Chanyeol sat up in bed. At some point his shirt had also come off and he really didn&rsquo;t know why he had bothered getting dressed or taking a shower in the first place. He also doubted they would be going anywhere that day.

&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Tao groaned, rolling over so he lay on his stomach. &ldquo;You love me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Chanyeol snorted and linked their hands together. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; He said, because even with all his fears and doubts, it was true.

Chen looses his wings. Yixing is there for him.</div>
<lj-cut text=""Angel"">
<hr />

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Jongdae breathed out with tears in his eyes. The words came out soft and small, <i>rushed,</i> carrying neither delight nor contempt but the vague bewilderment and awe that came with a sudden realization, a concession of a truth.</span>

<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">I love you. </span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">He repeated to himself and the weight of those words hit him hard in his chest. An ill-suited sorrow marred his features. Dread welled at the pit of his stomach; blood surged through his veins, making his body throb in a thick, uncomfortable heat. His breaths came short and quick. The tears spilled from his face. He shook his head. <i>No</i>. He didn&rsquo;t want this.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Yixing, I <i>Lo</i>&mdash;&rdquo; The pain came quick, sharp, and all Jongdae could do was gasp as the muscles in his body went rigid and his bones grew brittle. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">He barely got the word out when&mdash;<i>crack!</i>&mdash;another one snapped. A thick, agonizing moan escaped his lips. <i>No</i>! One after one, snap after nauseating <i>snap</i>, the bones in his wings broke. The pain was blindingly agonizing. Every fracture felt like a piercing stab into his chest, into his heart.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;<i>No</i>!&rdquo; He screamed, wanting to take those awful words back! What had he been thinking? <i>I love you</i>&mdash;how could he have been so <i>stupid</i>? He knew the rules. His brothers and sisters had taught him better than that. </span>

<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">But you never listened</span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">, his conscience mocked him. <i>You should have stayed in the garden, </i>it scolded.<i> You shouldn&rsquo;t have chased that bird or peaked over the edge&hellip;It&rsquo;s all your fault! You talked to the human boy and you fell in love. Foolish boy! You fell in love! Now look what you have done. You are falling.</i></span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">He was falling&hellip;</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;<i>No&hellip;</i>&rdquo; his voice broke and he sobbed, unable to hold himself back. He had never wanted <i>this</i>.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">He cried because of the pain, because of the loss of his wings and because he knew that taking back the words didn&rsquo;t make them any less true. It wouldn&rsquo;t have kept his wings from breaking. It wouldn&rsquo;t have kept his heart from breaking. </span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">He would never be able to fly again. Even if he had still had his wings&mdash;which was impossible, the laws were set&mdash;he would never have been permitted to go back into the garden. He would never see his brothers and sisters again and a horrifyingly grim loneliness setting over him in that moment. He felt like an irrecoverable part of him had been torn away and left to die.</span>

<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">Is this what it is like to be human?</span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""> He thought before the pain overtook him and the darkness swallowed him.</span>


 
<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">The chirping of small birds woke him up. <i>Morning</i>, he thought in misery. He would never again fly with them.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">The pain was excruciating. When he moved it became as sharp as a knife, cutting him and reopening his bloody, scabbing wounds. When he stilled it became a deep throbbing thing, raw and sore and red with heat. He could feel where they had been, his wings&mdash;the memory of them still fresh and a hundred times more agonizing than the hurt of his body.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">His feathers had fallen, he thought absently. They were everywhere on the bed and on the floor. He could see them, had <i>felt</i> them&mdash;their tips withering. The once strong bonds, now weak and flimsy, had dangled and then, becoming too heavy to hang on any longer, fell. Like he had.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">The tears made the world blurry, but he blinked them back. His throat constricted and he forced himself to relax. He would not <i>cry</i>. He wouldn&rsquo;t.</span>



<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Jongdae?&rdquo; He heard a croak and realized he was lying on the other boy. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;What&mdash;&rdquo;Jongdae looked the other boy over, biting his lips. He looked at the dark purple and red bruises that marred Yixing&rsquo;s naked chest, shoulders and arms that held him&mdash;had Yixing held on to him all night? Jongdae saw the teeth marks that sunk into Yixing&rsquo;s left shoulder and the bloodied claw marks that seemed to cut into the other boy&rsquo;s arms and sides.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; reluctantly, Jongdae stroked one. The blood had dried and they were in the process of scabbing over. &ldquo;Did I&mdash;&rdquo; He heard his voice break. He told himself he wasn&rsquo;t going to cry but the tears wouldn&rsquo;t listen and it wasn&rsquo;t long before he was sobbing again.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Jongdae,&rdquo; Yixing&rsquo;s arms tightened around him.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;I hurt you.&rdquo; He loved Yixing and yet Jongdae had hurt him.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;This is nothing. They&rsquo;ll heal.&rdquo; Why? Why didn&rsquo;t he hate him?</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo; Jongdae twisted, trying to sit up but didn&rsquo;t get very far. It was too painful to move much so they laid on their sides.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Jongdae,&rdquo; Yixing pulled his closer, shushing him and wiping away the tears as best he could. He kissed Jongdae. Kissed him on the eyes, on the forehead, on the cheeks, lips shoulders forearms, anywhere he could reach, until the tears came less frequently, until the horrible noises Jongdae was making stopped and all Jongdae could think about was <i>him</i>. How he was there, sweet, kind and solid, like a rock. Yixing was his anchor. His love.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Yixing asked, letting Jongdae bury his face in the crook of his neck. He ran a soothing hand down Jongdae&rsquo;s side where it didn&rsquo;t hurt as much.</span>
<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">Jongdae wanted everything to be okay. He wanted the pain to go away. He wanted his wings back, to be himself again. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He wanted Yixing to hold him tighter and never let go. </span>
 


<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you mad?&rdquo; Jongdae asked after a while. &ldquo;Why are you so kind to me?&rdquo; Truth be told, he dreaded the answer. He dreaded it even more when Yixing pulled him away so they were face to face, their noses almost touching. He dreaded it when Yixing looked at him and Jongdae saw the smile in his eyes; saw the happiness that lay there because it made him feel like everything would okay, even though he wasn&rsquo;t an angel anymore. It made him feel like he could live like this, as a human, with Yixing.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Because I love you.&rdquo; Yixing kissed him and held him tight across the waist. Jongdae fell asleep with silent tears in his eyes, the smell of blood and sweat and the taste of Yixing on his lips.</span>

<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">He had lost his wings and that was not okay. He was not okay, but, he thought, for Yixing he could be. For Yixing he could pretend he was okay until the lies became truths and he wouldn&rsquo;t cry whenever he thought of what he had lost, of the world he had left behind.</span>

<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">This</span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;"">, he thought,<i> is also what being human is like? </i>Being tied down and not minding. Losing things dear to you and gaining other things that, although would not replace the lost ones, would become just as precious. He would always miss his wings. He would miss the sky and the wind and the birds. He would miss his brothers and sisters and the garden that had been his home for all of his life, but he had found a new place to belong in and would make this place his home along with the one he loved.</span>

"event","This is based off of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and inspired by an 8018 doujinshi. I&#39;d love to do it someday but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll happen anytime soon. I wrote this outline like last year and didn&#39;t really finish Chen&#39;s POV or really complete the outline. I&#39;ll probably come back and edit the outline later. Also I don&#39;t check spelling or grammer in outlines so...yeah.

<b>Lay POV</b>

Starts with Chen and Lay and the rest of their crews in a fight. It&rsquo;s clear that there can be no winner and both sides are about to retreat. They&rsquo;re all in masks so no one knows the identity of anyone else. Something happens, an explosion or something and Chen&rsquo;s mask comes off. Stunned, Lay just stands there and before Chen passes out, he sees Lay take off his mask and is as shocked as Lay was to see the truth.

(Could be a freghn house &ndash; a safe house that people who have no place to go gather) It&rsquo;s not a shelter.
It&rsquo;s a big house with 5 (~6) rooms. It&rsquo;s originally Suho&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s house, but after they died, he decided to rent out the rooms. The basement&rsquo;s his and his brother&rsquo;s area. One bedroom goes to Kyungsoo, a local university student, and another is rented out by Chanyeol and Baekhyun, a young couple who have been together for a while. Chen is already there when Lay rents the last room.

Lay doesn&rsquo;t see Chen when he first starts living there but he sees Chen&rsquo;s things all around the place. He asks about him and everyone tells Lay that Chen&rsquo;s a little like him. Young, and mysterious. They don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s from or what he does for a living, but they think he&rsquo;s a university music student because of his age and because he has a violin and a piano. They can also sometimes hear him singing.

Lay tells everyone he&rsquo;s a foreign exchange student from China. He&rsquo;s young and of age so he can get away with it.

He&rsquo;s already settled when Chen finally comes back home. He arrives very early in the morning. Lay is already gone by then. That night, Lay hears something in the kitchen and goes down to check it out. He thinks that it&rsquo;s something dangerous and that he&rsquo;s been found out already. He prepares, he takes a knife and conceals it.

One of them makes a noise and they both jump to the ready, surprised. Chen&rsquo;s mouth is full, so he swallows and asks who Lay is. Lay introduces himself and Chen laughs because Suho told him about the new tenet (through SMS). He says something about not knowing the new guy was going to be that handsome and Lay doesn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s flirting with him or not. Chen continues though and asks if Lay&rsquo;s hungry too. Chen&rsquo;s just woken up so that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s eating now. Lay says no and goes back to bed.

The days pass and Chen stays in. Lay wonders if what he does because or if he&rsquo;s skipping classes. Chen&rsquo;s a mystery to him. The boy stays in his room for most of the day playing piano or violin and sometimes singing. Sometimes Lay knows the songs he plays and sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t. Chen doesn&rsquo;t leave his room unless he&rsquo;s hungry, from what Lay&rsquo;s seen. When he sees Chen out on the balcony one day Lay suddenly asks if he has no classes. Chen doesn&rsquo;t seem to know what he&rsquo;s talking about. Lay elaborates and tells him that Suho told him that he was an university student and a musicion. It takes a while before Chen responds. He just stares at Lay, squinty eyes and everything, and then slowly nods.

Chen asks if Lay&rsquo;s a student and Lay tells him his cover story. Lay names some place in china (Changsha?) and Chen recognizes it. They get into a conversation. It turns out that Chen lived in China when he was younger, in Beijing for a little while before his family moved back to South Korea. His father was transfered there for a couple years. He knows mandarin, though it&rsquo;s slowly fading (it&rsquo;s not. Lay knows it&rsquo;s perfect but he doesn&rsquo;t think much of it.)

They talk more and more and become close.

<hr />

Flash to present where Lay&rsquo;s staying over at Luhan&rsquo;s place. He&rsquo;s getting treated. Lay doesn&rsquo;t tell Luhan or Kris or Tao why he doesn&rsquo;t want to go back to his place. They know he has a boyfriend now and wonder why he hasn&rsquo;t called and told him he&rsquo;s not going to make it back. In the end he does call but all he gets is Suho saying that Chen hasn&rsquo;t come back home yet. He wonders if Chen ever will and tells the others that he doesn&rsquo;t know if he even has a boyfriend anymore. They all think it&rsquo;s just a little thing, and tell him it&rsquo;s going to be fine but he doesn&rsquo;t think so. They think he&rsquo;s being a drama queen but he still doesn&rsquo;t tell them.

He doesn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll do if they ever found out.

<hr />

Flash to past.
It&rsquo;s some kind of special day and the whole house if gathered around the table. Chen and Lay are speaking in Mandarin and someone makes a joke about them. The table laughs and all that. It&rsquo;s all fun and jokes. Later that night, they&rsquo;re all watching a movie and Lay goes outside for some fresh air. He&rsquo;s not out there long before Chen is with him. He&rsquo;s carrying some desert thing that Suho or someone made and gives it to Lay.

They flirt, look at the city&rsquo;s lights and hold hands. That&rsquo;s when they started going out.
Their first kiss was a couple nights later, their second kiss, a couple seconds after the first.

<hr />

Those were the happy times, Lay thinks. (Flash to present in Luhan&rsquo;s aprt.) He thinks about when he and Chen went out on dates and the little moments they shared. His hand goes to his neck and he thinks about the matching necklaces he gotten for their one year annaversarry. Both of them were going to be out of town then so they changed the date to earlier. He had given Chen a necklace. It was a locket but thin enough for Chen not to notice. He had hidden a bug in it, so he could know where Chen was at all times. His line of work wasn&rsquo;t very safe and he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to live with himself if he, in any way, causes Chen harm.

He thinks of using the traking device now but he can&rsquo;t bring himself to. He doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;ll do when he does locate Chen.

Thinking about how Chen was still mysterious even after they had gotten together. They both traveled. Sometimes Chen came back with strange marks, saying that he had fallen into something or tripped over something. It was a lie, it was always a lie, but Lay chose to believe it. He had though someone was hurting him, that he was being bullied or something but now he doesn&rsquo;t know what to think. Maybe Chen wasn&rsquo;t being bullied. Maybe he was the one doing the bullying.

He knew the name Chen and he knew the name Jongdae. Chen was a ruthless killer. He was crafty, manipulative and always seemed to get away clean during a job. Jongdae was the sweet boy he had meet and had fallen in love with and had sworn never to let get hurt. Never had he thought the two would be the same person. To him, they didn&rsquo;t even live in the same universe.

He wonders what he&rsquo;s going to do.

<p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">That afternoon Jongdae had come to the conclusion that Baekhyun hadn&rsquo;t been leading him on. Show Choir was actually fun, even though it was completely different from regular choir. They had pretty much belted&mdash;<i>belted</i> because what came out of their mouths was definitely <i>not</i> singing&mdash;out pop songs and discussed their favorite songs and singers for two hours. Jongdae had loved it.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He only wished there were more people in the club. It had been fun with just the three of them but with more people they would actually get to perform and compete. Competition was something Baekhyun had gone on and on about and Jongdae was more the slightly curious about how it felt to actually perform, even though he was a little nervous.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Only Baekhyun, Kyungsoo and Jongdae had attended club that afternoon. Chanyeol seemed to have disappeared after last period. Both Baekhyun and Kyungsoo had texted him and tried to call him, but had gotten no answer and gave up after a couple of minutes. Baekhyun had promised to yell at him later.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">After two hours practice was over and the boys were getting ready to leave.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to karaoke after okay?&rdquo; Baekhyun said while rummaging through his backpack.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Sure, sounds fun. I have to tell my dad first though.&rdquo; Jongdae nodded. He and Kyungsoo were sitting on the only couch in the Choir room, going through one last song.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Okay.

I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; He said and left the club room.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Ha. Alright man.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Baekhyun froze. He knew that voice. He turned around and sure enough, there was Chanyeol, but what was he doing with Kris&rsquo;s gang? Baekhyun wondered as he watched Chanyeol clap hands with Minseok, Kris and Tao, pulling each guy into a quick bro-hug.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;That was sick.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Sick? What?&rdquo; Tao turned to Minseok who chuckled.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It means good.&rdquo; he explained and Tao turned back to Chanyeol grinning (<i>what the eff?</i>). Baekhyun blinked. Was he seeing things?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Thanks. You were pretty good too. You sure you don&rsquo;t wanna come to Minseok-ge&rsquo;s with us?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah, can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m meeting a couple of friends for&hellip; &rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It was then that Chanyeol turned, finally noticing Baekhyun, who just stood there, staring at him. Baekhyun wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do or what to say. He wasn&#39;t even sure what he was seeing was actually happening because <i>what the hell</i>? Since when did Chanyeol abandon his friends and hang out wi&mdash;with Kris&rsquo;s gang like they had been friends forever when Baekhyun hadn&rsquo;t ever seen them talk to each other before this&mdash;whatever <i>this</i> was?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Therefore it was Chanyeol who spoke first. &ldquo;Baek?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Kyungsoo asked, more than a little worried. Baekhyun had come into the room fuming. He went straight to his backpack and starting shoving his things in.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; he muttered, forcing the words out through gritted teeth. There was obviously something wrong. Kyungsoo exchanged looks with Jongdae, who shrugged, as oblivious as Kyungsoo. Baekhyun had been fine before he had left.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Instead of hanging out like they had planned, the three split ways at the gates. Jongdae went home while Kyungsoo went with Baekhyun to find out what was really wrong and to make sure he was okay.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;How could he!&rdquo; Baekhyun screamed and threw himself on his bed. He yelled, thrashing his limbs every which way and Kyungsoo waited until Baekhyun stilled before cautiously approaching. He nudged the other boy over to make some room but when Baekhyun refused to move he sighed and sat crisscross in the little available space left. Baekhyun&rsquo;s bed wasn&rsquo;t very big and it didn&rsquo;t help that the boy took up more than half of it.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was a moment of silence and Kyungsoo, worried, decided to poke Baekhyun, repeatedly, not stopping until the Baekhyun gave an exasperated noise and slapped his hand away. He waited five seconds before asking, &ldquo;So are going to tell me what happened or what?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It took another five seconds for him to get an answer.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Chanyeol&rsquo;s part of the Rapping Club now.&rdquo; Baekhyun muttered into his pillow, quiet and soft, and Kyungsoo had to strain his ears to hear him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s <i>what</i>?&rdquo; It came out louder than be had expected but he couldn&rsquo;t have been bothered to care because he had not been expecting this. &ldquo;Chanyeol? But isn&rsquo;t that Kris&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;But rapping?

That&rsquo;s like&mdash;<i>wait</i>&mdash;what about Show Choir?&rdquo; Chanyeol couldn&rsquo;t be in Show Choir and in the Rapping Club at the same time.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;He quit.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;<i>What</i>?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;He quit, Kyungsoo. He fucking quit and abandoned us for those&mdash;those <i>weirdos</i>!&rdquo; Kyungsoo stared wide-eyed at Baekhyun.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Quit</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">? He couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Chanyeol had always been as passionate about Show Choir as they had. He <i>loved</i> Show Choir as much as Baekhyun and Kyungsoo. He was always the one who wanted to practice, either in the clubroom or at karaoke when practice ended.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Chanyeol was also one of the most hardworking members of the club. The three of them had been in Show Choir since they were first years (had been together since the 7<sup>th</sup> grade when Chanyeol had moved into town) and even though Chanyeol hadn&rsquo;t been the very best of singers, he had worked the hardest, practiced the hardest, and had improved the most out of everyone. Even now, he wasn&rsquo;t the best singer, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from trying.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was always one of the first ones in the clubroom and last ones to leave&mdash;well not recently, but before, the start of the semester and last year&mdash;and that&rsquo;s when it hit Kyungsoo. Chanyeol had been talking about Show Choir less and less and recently seemed to avoid the topic, always managing to digress or get distracted by something so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to talk about it. He hadn&rsquo;t gone to club at all that day&mdash;it had only been Kyungsoo and Baekhyun in the morning and the two of them plus Jongdae that afternoon. It hadn&rsquo;t seemed very unusual before this moment, but it wasn&rsquo;t until this moment that Kyungsoo realized that slowly, Chanyeol had been distancing himself from the club. He probably hadn&rsquo;t realized it because they shared so many classes.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Did he say why?&rdquo; He asked, though he thought he probably already knew the reason why.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Baekhyun turned his head to face Kyungsoo; the expression on his face was a mixture of anger and frustration. Though he didn&rsquo;t show it, Kyungsoo could tell he was also confused and felt a little betrayed because that was what Kyungsoo was feeling at the moment as well.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

Baekhyun said nothing, watching as the members of the rapping club said their goodbyes.

He fiddled with his book because he couldn&rsquo;t look Joonmyun in the eyes, embarrassed that the other boy would see through him in a heartbeat&mdash;if he hadn&rsquo;t already.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He hadn&rsquo;t lied.&nbsp; Chanyeol hung out with Kris&rsquo;s gang and Jongdae had often spotted him and Yixing together. He&rsquo;d also seen the older boy around the school, in the halls and after class. Jongdae knew that seeing someone around was not something to get embarrassed about normally, but people didn&rsquo;t normally unconsciously seek out other people now did they?

He didn&rsquo;t know Yixing. He hadn&rsquo;t even ever spoken to the guy.

Jongdae could overhear him and Baekhyun arguing the validity of the rumors surrounding Kris and he found that he really didn&rsquo;t care about Kris all that much. He had given Jongdae a shock, but he had helped him up, even if he <i>had</i> laughed at him&mdash;<i>what had that been about anyway?</i> Jongdae wasn&rsquo;t in the business of labeling people and Kris didn&rsquo;t seem like a bad guy.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Who was the other guy?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Who? Tao?&rdquo; Kyungsoo answered. &ldquo;The other tall one? He&rsquo;s a transfer student from China. He&rsquo;s supposed to be some martial arts expert.

I try not to look at them. Especially not in the eyes.&rdquo; He elbowed Jongdae in the side, smirking. Jongdae chuckled.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah, I wish I had known that.

They kinda just keep to themselves. Yixing&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know. I had math and history with him last year. He didn&rsquo;t say much and slept most of the time.&rdquo; Jongdae waited for Kyungsoo to pay for his lunch before heading off in the direction Baekhyun and Chanyeol had. &ldquo;I heard he&rsquo;s a good dancer?&rdquo; Kyungsoo shrugged again. He wasn&rsquo;t really an expert in the affairs of other students, especially not Zhang Yixing.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Why do you want to know anyway?&rdquo; Jongdae shrugged.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I saw him in the front office today and was just wondering.&rdquo; As he said it his eyes landed on the table Yixing was sitting at.

There were a surprising number of foreigners at Sung-Hee High.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">
</p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">***</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Joonmyun stretched and yawned. He leaned back into his chair and closed his eyes. A cool breeze blew in from the open window and it felt nice. It was almost the end of August, yet it still felt like summer. The weather was hot, up in the low nineties &ndash; high eighties but it was cooling down.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Joonmyun couldn&rsquo;t wait for autumn to come. It wasn&rsquo;t as hot as summer, nor as cold as winter. He guessed most people would&rsquo;ve preferred spring, the season of new life with all its holiday hype, but not Joonmyun. He held autumn close to his heart.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was a knock on the door and Joonmyun, not wanting to get up, called to whoever was outside that the door was open. He smiled when he saw Kris because he almost never saw Kris during the school day. For a fleeting moment he wondered if something horrible had happened to one of the guys and blinked when Kris set a plastic bag down on his desk.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Lunch.&rdquo; He said, taking a chair from one of the other desks. Kris pushed the papers, packets and books that were stacked on Joonmyun&rsquo;s desk onto the surrounding ones, careful to keep them in their original piles and order. He knew how Joonmyun liked to keep his desk organized and how it drove him crazy when something was out of place. It drove <i>Kris</i> crazy listening to him grumble about it and he really didn&rsquo;t want to deal with all of that right now. Needless to say, Kris liked it when Joonmyun was happy and one of the ways to keep him happy and off his back was to shut up and do things his way.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Curious, Joonmyun opened the bag, then blinked because really? McDonalds?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;What? It was all I had time to get.&rdquo; Kris said. Joonmyun shrugged and set out the paper plates that were also in the bag. He dumped the fries on one plate and set them in the middle. They always ended up stealing each other&rsquo;s anyway.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the club?&rdquo; Joonmyun asked when they were well into the meal. &ldquo;You got a new member, right? Finally got enough members to be an official club now?&rdquo; Kris chuckled into his drink and nodded.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah Finally. One more member and maybe you can even quit.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be the day.&rdquo; He smirked and popped a fry into his mouth. &ldquo;So who&rsquo;s the poor kid?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Poor kid?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Has to be something wrong with him if he wants to join a club with you in it&mdash;<i>ow</i>! Okay okay&rdquo; Joonmyun laughed when Kris kicked him under the desk.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Kidding, kidding&rdquo; He said and kicked Kris back. &ldquo;And besides, if he&rsquo;s crazy for joining your club, what&rsquo;s that make me?&rdquo; He nudged Kris from under the table, maneuvering his legs so they were pressed up against the other boy&rsquo;s and left them there, seeming to forget about them. Kris snorted and shook his head but didn&rsquo;t move his legs either.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;So who is it?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Hm?

Isn&rsquo;t he in Show Choir? Why does want to join a rapping club?&rdquo; Joonmyun wasn&rsquo;t judging, just asking. The two clubs might as well have been worlds apart. Even though they were all performers, singers and rappers didn&rsquo;t get along for some reason. Joonmyun didn&rsquo;t know why&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t pretend to know what went on in a teenager&rsquo;s head (even though he was one himself). It was all the same to him, but from what he had seen and heard, others thought otherwise.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He also knew the two clubs practiced at the same times. Chanyeol couldn&#39;t have been in both Show Choir and rapping at the same time.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Kris shrugged. &ldquo;He showed up at practice this morning. He&rsquo;s good. Really good.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Good enough to enter the talent show?&rdquo; Joonmyun asked, curious. Kris shrugged again.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; He hadn&rsquo;t thought about it. He didn&rsquo;t even know if they were going to enter the talent show this year, but the Autumn Festival was two months away. He figured he still had time to decide.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming up fast you know.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah but it&rsquo;s not here yet. Besides, I don&rsquo;t know what Minseok or Yixing are going to do. They could be dancing for the talent show.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they say that they&rsquo;re only doing it if Luhan was with them?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah but who knows what Luhan will do.

What about Tao?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Kris paused then said &ldquo;We might just do it by ourselves then. I know Tao wants to do it but he&rsquo;s a little&hellip;&rdquo; Kris trailed off and Joonmyun chuckled, thinking about the first couple of times the younger boy had performed for him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; His lack of experience combined with his inability to accurately pronounce Korean words and his stage fright didn&rsquo;t make for a very good show. The boy was getting better though. Joonmyun was looking forward to the next time he could visit the second floor music room where the club usually practiced. If only he wasn&rsquo;t so busy with the student council.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">They talked about club related things and non-club related things until the bell rang and lunch was over. Kris had Phys. Ed. next while Joonmyun had independent study which, since it was only two weeks into the semester, meant student council work. <i>It officially sucked being the President</i>, he thought with a sigh. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He thanked Kris for lunch. Kris nodded, patting Joonmyun on the head. He couldn&rsquo;t really empathize with Joonmyun, having the common sense to steer clear of any and all work related to the student council, but he still felt sorry for him and hoped that the workload lessened. He missed spending time with Joonmyun.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Oh.

He took out his homework and passed it up to the front, feigning interest for about all of ten minutes before getting lost, then bored with what the teacher was talking about and took out his cell phone.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He hated fifth period Chemistry. He barely understood anything that went on in the class even when he was paying attention. All the formulas and the names of the elements and compounds sounded like alien-speak to him, but then again, it was like that with all science classes. Sehun and science just didn&rsquo;t mesh well. He dreaded next year when he was going to have to take Biology and Physics. At least next year Jongin would be with him in Physics.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Another reason Sehun disliked the class was because he had no one to talk to. Jongin wasn&rsquo;t around and sure Jongin wasn&rsquo;t his only friend&mdash;he knew a bunch of kids who liked to skate and went to the skate park but they were just &#39;hello&#39; friends. People he could say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to in the hallway and sit with at lunch and in class so he wouldn&rsquo;t seem like such a loser. Jongin was the only one he actually talked to&mdash;about real stuff, not the stuff like how much he hated science or about how much it sucked that they had to run laps for the second half of gym or how much Coach Kang just sucked. (Not all the students were in his cross country team. <i>Why the fuck couldn&rsquo;t Kang figure that out?)</i></span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

She sat five rows away from Sehun, all the way on the other side of the classroom.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It wasn&rsquo;t that Sehun hated Krystal, he just didn&rsquo;t like her. Before, he hadn&rsquo;t really paid attention to her. She was one of the Populars, and he was a Skater. They didn&rsquo;t mix. End of story. Her existence hadn&rsquo;t bothered him all that much. Nowadays, though? It was a whole different story.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The thing was Sehun didn&rsquo;t know that much about her except for the fact that she was really pretty, really loud, dressed weirdly and was going out with Luhan. He had over looked all of that&mdash;she was a Popular, what was he going to do?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He had over looked the fact that her annoyingly high pitched voice seemed to carry from all the way to the other side of the room. He quietly cast his eyes away when she showed up to school wearing all neon everything with wacky tacky stockings with frilly tassel-ly stuff Sehun didn&rsquo;t care to know the name of.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sehun might&rsquo;ve been gay but it wasn&rsquo;t like he was afraid of girls or thought all of them were icky. He knew a naturally pretty girl from one who caked on too much make up and drowned herself in perfume and Krystal&hellip;Krystal was&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sehun huffed and buried his face in his arms. He glared at his desk because he was gay and Krystal&rsquo;s voice wasn&rsquo;t all that annoying and her choice of clothes wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> blinding, possibly fashionable&mdash;well daring at least (Sehun didn&rsquo;t pretend to understand but she did look good) and Sehun kind of admired her for it.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was gay which didn&rsquo;t change the fact that she <i>was</i> pretty and clearly didn&rsquo;t need a lot of make-up and no, she didn&rsquo;t drown herself in perfume.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was fucking gay and he kinda, sorta&mdash;yeah he pretty much hated himself at this point because the only reason he hated <i>her</i> was because she was dating <i>fucking </i><i>Lufuckinghan</i>. It didn&rsquo;t help that he sometimes wished he could like her&mdash;to crush on her instead of her boyfriend because that would make him that much more normal and that much less of the fucking loser he already was.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sehun wasn&rsquo;t stupid. He knew he didn&rsquo;t have a chance in hell with Luhan. Luhan was perfect. He was captain of the soccer team and one of the top students, while Sehun was barely passing. The whole fucking school wanted to be Luhan&rsquo;s friend; girls practically threw themselves at him, while Sehun would just settle for just one fucking glance.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sehun had fallen and fallen hard. He wasn&rsquo;t stupid but he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel that way because Jongin was right. He probably thinks that Sehun doesn&rsquo;t listen when he speaks but Sehun does. He hears every word and no matter how many times he hears them, Jongin&rsquo;s rants never failed to make him feel even shittier than he already felt.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">If there was one thing he had learned so far it was that love fucking sucked.</span></span>

<p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sung-Hee High School is&mdash;as its neighbors have affectionately dubbed it&mdash;a queer little private school nestled in quiet area and is an hours&rsquo; drive from the metropolitan city of Seoul. Sung-Hee High is known for outstanding excellence in academics, the arts and sports and its motivated students; however, the school is most notable for the unusual way it runs.</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Lee Min Hyung, the school&rsquo;s founder, had chosen to model the institution after western schools. Driving up to Sung-Hee, you may find that the exterior doesn&rsquo;t look very much different from a normal South Korean school. There are two buildings of varying sizes. One is four stories and the other is three stories high. Both stand side by side and are connected by a series of zigzagging stairways and two bridges. Sung-Hee has a moderate sized gymnasium and track to accommodate the sports teams. The school also houses a large auditorium for various school functions but is primarily used by the theater, choir and orchestra clubs. It may look like a regular high school at first&mdash;when you aren&rsquo;t looking too close that is.</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The first unusual fact people generally notice about Sung-Hee High is the lack of uniforms. Students and teachers are allowed to wear whatever they want&mdash;as long as it complies with the dress code outlined in page 11, paragraph 2 of the student handbook of course&mdash;as Sung-Hee is all about allowing their students to express themselves and believes that the implementation of uniforms suppresses a student&rsquo;s individuality as well as their creativity.</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The second abnormality people observe about the school is the casualness of interactions between grade levels compared to normal Korean schools. The ease at which students interact with each other and how the school promotes such interactions, not as a disregard for general politeness to seniors and teachers, but to promote camaraderie between the students and foster life-long friendships, which is all part of Sang-Hee High School&rsquo;s vision (page 2, paragraph 1).</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">After the initial shock of the abnormalities one and two, parents and guardians who are interested in sending their children to the high school inquire about the unique teaching style and class system that Sung-Hee employs which leads to the abnormality number three.</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">As previously stated, Lee Min Hyung, the founder, heavily modeled the school after western schools systems, specifically after the American school system, borrowing aspects he had observed while living overseas and thought would benefit the students. In Sung-Hee, the classes an individual takes are not centered around grade level, like in most traditional schools, but are based on how advanced the student is in the subject, completion of any prerequisite courses and the student&rsquo;s own initiative. Students are given the choice of which classes offered at to take. Many classes have a mix of students from all three grades levels&hellip;</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">


</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae sighed and put down the magazine. He was sitting on the bench in the main office and from what he had already seen: Sung-Hee High was not an average South Korean high school. He didn&rsquo;t need an article to tell him that. He peaked out the office windows and watched as the students shuffled through the halls. The school was unlike any other he had been to before and Jongdae had been to a lot of other schools. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The students were all dressed in casual clothes and Jongdae didn&rsquo;t know how to feel about this when he had heard about the school. He didn&rsquo;t like uniforms, but didn&rsquo;t hate them either. They gave him a sense of comfort and safety because they were school issued. Everyone else was wearing the same thing so no one could make fun of you for what you wore. He liked the idea of dressing casually at school, but Jongdae liked to dress in simple clothes. He wasn&rsquo;t flashy or trendy at all. He was currently wearing a pair of jeans he had laying around, a t-shirt and a half way zipped up hoodie. Looking at what the other kids were wearing made him feel a little self-conscious of his choice of clothes on his first day of school.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">That was the other thing. It was his <i>first</i> <i>day</i>. School had started in March. The first semester was over. It was the august and the second semester had started only two weeks prior. Jongdae had missed the start date so he couldn&rsquo;t really start fresh like he had wanted. By now everyone would have already made all the friends they would ever want to make this school year and there he would be&hellip;alone.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae shook his head and took a deep breath. This was no time to be thinking like that. It was his first day of school&mdash;one among many&mdash;but so what? He had been through this before hadn&rsquo;t he? He could handle it. He would have to. And Appa had promised that he could at least finish high school at Sung-Hee.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae was a second year. Usually his family, which now consisted of Appa and him (his younger sister chose to stay with their mother after the divorce), stayed in one place for only a couple of months before packing up and moving to a different location. This meant that if they did move again, it would be in his third year and Jongdae wanted to at least graduate <i>with</i> friends so he had jumped when Appa had told him they would be staying.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae closed his eyes and took another deep breath. Puffing up his cheeks, he exhaled slowly. He opened his eyes when he heard giggling and looked to one of the secretaries whose desk sat directly in front of him. She was young, younger than all of the other secretaries who looked to be in their 40s and 50s. She, however, looked to be in her twenties.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She gave him a knowing smile and asked &ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae made a feeble attempt to smile and nodded.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be. You&rsquo;ll be fine. The students here are really nice. You&rsquo;ll fit in in no time.&rdquo; She said. Jongdae could only hope.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It might take a while but everything will turn out okay in the end so don&rsquo;t worry too much okay sweetie? The name&rsquo;s Lee Soonkyu.&rdquo; She made a peace sign and posed like she was taking a selca. Jongdae raised a mental eyebrow. &ldquo;But everyone just calls me Sunny.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Uh, okay Sunny&hellip;?&rdquo; He said reluctantly, wondering 1) if it was actually okay to call her Sunny and 2) what kind of school this really was for a person lke Sunny to be working at.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Baekhyun should be here any minute.&rdquo; She said, looking over the papers on her desk as she spoke. &ldquo;Practice is almost over I think.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Oh, okay&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sunny glanced up at him and smiled again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, seriously. I went to this school&mdash;it&rsquo;s not that bad.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Really</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">? He opened his mouth to ask and promptly shut up when he heard a loud drawn out &ldquo;<i>Sunny</i>&rdquo;. A student walked into the office, a guitar case strapped to his back.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Baekhyun?</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;""> Jongdae, again opened his mouth and shut it when Sunny spoke.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;What do you want Yixing? I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo; She waved him away but the kid didn&rsquo;t seem to care. He squatted down next to the desk, crossed his arms on top of her desk and laid his head down.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always busy.&rdquo; He shrugged it off. Without taking her eyes off the papers Sunny sighed.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a battle at GN next Tuesday so come by and watch okay?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;What? Not even a please?&rdquo; she muttered and the Yixing kid immediately gave her a drawn out &ldquo;<i>Please</i>&rdquo;.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sunny sighed and said &ldquo;This kid. Can you believe him? Thinking I can drop everything and go to one of his dances.&rdquo; She was speaking to Jongdae and he would have nodded or done something equally awkward but as she said it the Yixing kid turned and for the first time since he entered the office was looking directly at Jongdae.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He has a strange looking face</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">, was the first thing that popped into Jongdae&rsquo;s mind. It wasn&rsquo;t ugly or unpleasant to look at and for some reason Jongdae&rsquo;s mind couldn&rsquo;t focus on anything but that thought. The other boy stared back, blinked and turned back to Sunny who sighed and mumbled <i>maybe</i> she would be there and that he should hurry up and get to class before the bell rang. Her response seemed to satisfy him because he beamed, said he&rsquo;d see her later and left without another glance at Jongdae.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">A minute or so passed until another student came in. This time Jongdae was sure it was Baekhyun because he was yelling &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here! I&rsquo;m here! Where&rsquo;s the new kid?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">
</p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">***</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">When he heard the giggling, Jongin rolled his eyes, turned to his best friend and scoffed because in the seconds it took him to turn the Populars had already rounded the corner and, as <i>usual</i>, Sehun&mdash;that transparent dumbass&mdash;had already locked his gaze on Luhan, Sung-Hee High&rsquo;s Prince. Jongin waited the thirty seconds&mdash;give or take&mdash;it took the Populars to move on to the next hallway&mdash; which was undoubtedly full of students whose sole purpose in life was to marvel at their beauty&mdash;to speak his mind because it was only then that Sehun would begin to function normally again&mdash;well as normal as he could function within an hour of being in such close proximity of Luhan.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You know you don&rsquo;t stand a chance with him right?&rdquo; Jongin shut his locker and slung his backpack over his shoulder. It took Sehun a few seconds to process his words and Jongin would&rsquo;ve thought the other boy hadn&rsquo;t heard him if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that this always happened when The Prince was nearby. It was just another one of the after effects of Sehun being able to breathe the same air as Luhan. Complete recovery would take about an hour, which was fine with Jongin because they had math first period. He and Sehun were both shit in it, no surprise there, but mostly because Jongin always slept through the class and Sehun was still on his Luhan High.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I could&hellip;&rdquo; The words came out slow and since Sehun was still staring down the hallway the Populars had disappeared to, Jongin rolled his eyes. He shut Sehun&rsquo;s locker for him, and slinging his arm around his friend, led the way to first period. The math classes were located on the fourth floor of Building A (who the hell had thought up that brilliant idea?) and there was just enough time to make it before the late bell rung.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Sure, you could.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;No really I sooooo could.&rdquo; Sehun began and then he sighed dreamily&mdash;yes <i>dreamily</i>&mdash;and said, &ldquo;He looked at me just now.&rdquo; Jongin raised an eyebrow.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Re-a-lly?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Dude, shut up. I swear he did. I saw him.&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongin sighed. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was a difference between having Luhan looking <i>at</i> you and having Luhan looking in the same direction you happen to be occupying space in for that moment in time. And besides they weren&rsquo;t the only ones who had lockers in the first year hallway&mdash;it was the <i>first year</i> <i>hallway</i> after all. By some remarkable luck they had scored the lockers near the entrance to the gym where the sports bulletin was located. It wouldn&rsquo;t really have been a surprise if the captain of the soccer team looked at it. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongin had had this conversation with Sehun before, but he sensed that the other boy hadn&rsquo;t been listening after the mention of Luhan&rsquo;s name.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Dude, face it. You&rsquo;re never gonna be able to tap that. He&rsquo;s the fucking Prince for fuck&rsquo;s sake, and you my man&mdash;&rdquo; Jongin gave Sehun a once over, emphasizing his washed out graphic-t, black skinnies that were ripped at the knees, and tore up five-month old converse, &ldquo;&mdash;are a skater.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He said it as if it was most obvious thing in the world, plain and simple. And it was, because in their world Luhan and Oh Sehun would never <i>ever</i> hook up. By the laws of nature, Populars and Skaters didn&rsquo;t mix. When the Populars weren&rsquo;t ignoring the Skaters&mdash;like they did all lesser social classes&mdash; they had&hellip;disagreements, to put it lightly. They didn&rsquo;t date or whatever it was that was going through Sehun&rsquo;s head when he was thinking of Luhan. Those were the laws of high school.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Luhan was Sung-Hee&rsquo;s fucking Prince. He was captain of the fucking soccer team. <i>Mr</i>. fucking <i>Perfect</i>. He was the guy that was fawned over, and idolized by practically the entire school. He could split up the closest of friends with a single look. He could make the most straight and narrow guys into flaming gays and lesbians fall at his feet with a wink&mdash;or so the story went. He could melt ice just by fucking smiling. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">(It was rumored that the ice caps were melting because in Luhan&rsquo;s first year, on the class trip to the ski slopes, a friend of a friend of one of the soccer members who was lucky enough to be in his almighty presence told Luhan a funny joke that made him smile for the rest of the day. He was like the fucking sun. Wherever he walked, or smiled at, snow melted.)</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Luhan was so popular and golden that when you said his name you said his full name, like Brittany Spears or Kanye West, or Regina George. But even then, Luhan was beyond celebrity status because he wasn&rsquo;t Lu-space-Han, he was Luhan.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">And Sehun was just a Skater. He had mediocre grades, didn&rsquo;t participate in clubs or sports teams, preferring to spend his time at the skate park, at the beach with some friends, or dancing with Jongin and Taemin.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">From Jongin&rsquo;s and basically everyone else&rsquo;s perspective, it was never meant to be and would not be. Not in this lifetime. If only Sehun would get that through his thick head and move on to someone a little closer to his social class. He might&rsquo;ve found someone there that suited him better.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; Jongin said as an afterthought, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going out with Krystal.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">His first class of the day was History, which, unsurprisingly, was a big snores fest. Jongdae had never been into History. He appreciated it, however the subject had never roused his interest like math or science had. It didn&rsquo;t help that Jongdae had already studied the topic being covered at his previous school.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was seat mates with Baekhyun, the Student-2-Student club member who was in charge of showing Jongdae around, and that wasn&rsquo;t so bad. They exchanged notes by passing a notebook back and forth and got to know each other better. They found out that they liked the same artists and both liked to sing. Baekhyun was going to be a world famous singer one day&mdash;or so he said, while Jongdae would&rsquo;ve been happy to just be able to get into the choir. Baekhyun had talked him into auditioning after school; he said would ask the instructor and had practically promised Jongdae a spot.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He had explained that there weren&#39;t many students who were interested in choir. Their numbers were dreadfully low. This year they didn&rsquo;t even have enough members to compete. The third years from the previous year who had made up most of the Choir had all graduated which left the total member count to three&mdash;four if Jongdae joined. They had tried recruiting members, were still tiring, but no one seemed to be even remotely interested.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Everyone at the school thought all the choir did was sing a bunch of old classical chorus songs and opera shit but that wasn&rsquo;t the case. Sung-Hee had a show choir. They sang the songs they loved, new and old, and had fun doing it. It didn&rsquo;t help that choir, show or not, was seen as uncool by the general school populous. Baekhyun didn&rsquo;t really understand this. It was just like norebang, except in front of an audience.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&#39;The woes of being a choir geek.&#39;</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;""> Baekhyun scribbled on the page, sighing softly. They were lower than the band geeks.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae had been part of the choir at his old school, but it hadn&rsquo;t been a show choir and was growing more and more excited as the conversation went on. He wasn&rsquo;t sure about the dancing bit, but he loved to sing, to perform, so why not? Joining the choir might&rsquo;ve also been a good way to make some of those <i>life-long friends</i> that magazine article had been talking about.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">After History was math and then science. Jongdae had math with Baekhyun and Chanyeol, one of Baekhyun&rsquo;s friends. Baekhyun and Jongdae parted ways in third period (Jongdae was in Mr. Han&rsquo;s science class while Baekhyun was in Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s with Chanyeol). They walked down to the science classrooms together&mdash;there were only three and they were all located on the first floor&mdash;where Jongdae was introduced to Kyungsoo, another one of Baekhyun&rsquo;s friends. Both Kyungsoo and Chanyeol were in the choir. Baekhyun assured him that he would probably want to kill both of them before the year was up with all four of them having study hall fourth period. His only escape would be in English and PE.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae had laughed and gone along with everything, silently rejoicing because this was it wasn&rsquo;t it? He had friends now. He had people to sit with at lunch on his first day and people to talk to in class and in-between classes. <i>That hadn&rsquo;t been so hard</i>, he thought to himself. He smiled and it lasted for the rest of the period.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll talk to Mrs. Im after lunch.&rdquo; Baekhyun shifted his books to one hand and opened his locker. &ldquo;Just so she&rsquo;ll know to expect you for practice today.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae nodded along while trying to fit everything in his locker. It was right beside Kyungsoo&rsquo;s, which was right beside Baekhyun which was right beside Chanyeol&rsquo;s. Jongdae hadn&rsquo;t gotten a chance to put his things in his locker that morning; he had gone straight to class, so he had been carrying all his books in his backpack. It felt immensely lighter after all his binders and textbooks were neatly organized in his locker.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The building bricks of my education</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">, Jongdae thought with a snicker, and then vowed to never make that joke again. He&rsquo;d spent more than a month alone&mdash;well alone with Appa which was more or less the same as being alone since they were so close and were used to each other&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies. He had forgotten that normal people tended to look at you strangely when you laughed randomly in the middle of the hallway.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Jongdae said, trying to play it off. He turned around only to embarrass himself further by knocking into someone and being the only one to fall.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">To be fair, the halls <i>were</i> super crowded and it didn&rsquo;t help that <i>some</i> people were just standing around, blocking the path, limiting the available walking space like they <i>owned</i> the hallway or something and if Jongdae sounded even remotely bitter about this it was only because the person who he had bumped into was tall, <i>extremely</i> tall (in hindsight it was ridiculous that he was intimidated by this because Chanyeol was tall and all but it probably wouldn&rsquo;t have left as big as impression on him if he hadn&rsquo;t been looking up from the floor), and looked pissed as hell. He looked like he could beat Jongdae to a smooth, liquidly pulp. His friend, who looked like he had never smiled a day in his life, could have probably done the same, judging by those arms.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Um&hellip;sorry?&rdquo; he tried not to squeak.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&hellip;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; The boy said without changing his expression. Jongdae couldn&rsquo;t tell if he actually meant it or not.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The guy extended his hand and for a second there Jongdae thought he really <i>was</i> going to get beat up. He held it in front of Jongdae and Jongdae just stared at it, not sure what to do next. He glanced up. The tall guy raised an eyebrow. The smirk playing at his lips wasn&rsquo;t a malicious one, maybe a little bit irritated but more amused than anything else so Jongdae decided why the hell not, and took his hand.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;No problem...&rdquo; The tall guy gave Jongdae a once over and asked &ldquo;New?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">When Jongdae nodded, yes he was new, the guy gave him another once over, snorted, then walked away. The whole encounter had probably lasted less than thirty seconds but it was one of most frightening and bizarre experiences Jongdae had ever had.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">As he watched the tall guy and his no-smile friend leave, Jongdae came face to face with another boy he hadn&#39;t noticed before. He was shorter than the others, about his height maybe, he didn&rsquo;t know for sure. What he did know was that it was same guy from this morning. In an eerie reminder of what had happened that morning, the boy stared at him, blinked and then walked away, following the two other boys.</span></span>

He gives a small smile before placing his lips on the others&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s peaceful there. In the arms of his most beloved, warm in this silent room, it was truly peaceful.

Someone was near, possibly a guard or maybe a monk he couldn&rsquo;t tell, but whoever&nbsp; it was he couldn&rsquo;t let them catch him in here, not like this, with the other holding him. Something bad would defiantly happen, to himself or to the other, mostly likely to the other.

Under the dimly lit streets and soon-to-be night sky, he smiles. He smiles remembering the memories of his childhood. Remembering the first time he climbed to the top of the tallest tree in the park, and the time when he fell down scraping his left knee on a shard of glass when he was younger, and&hellip;and the first time he met <i>him</i>, his most fondest one of all.</span></span></p><p><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">He was making mud pies in the dirt, piling them up one by one in stacks of 10s then 20s then 30s until they would topple over merging into one. He would give a little groan of pain, all his hard work going down the drain like that and having to starting all over again.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">But he looked happy. Padding the mud into shape with his little five-year-old hands while humming his little song, unaware of the fact that he was getting mud all over himself, he was happy. And that&rsquo;s what Yunho liked about him. Every day in the people filled park, he would always see that boy all alone, but enjoying every minute of it.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Yunho finally approached the boy and over time the two became close friends.

There it was, standing a foot, the small caf&eacute; the other always talked about. It was the first time Yunho had ever seen it, but judging from the outside, this was the right place. He could feel it. Painted pink and white with chairs and tables outside as well as inside, clear glass windows across both sides of the building, and a mini chalkboard sign that read &lsquo;WELCOME&rsquo;, it was felt just like <i>him</i>.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Yunho peered through the still-lit windows spying a black haired figure dressed in baby blue with an white apron hanging around his waist.

His once gentle smile turned bittersweet, eyes freezing on one particular picture.</span></span><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Jaejoong looked up from his current spot, &ldquo;huh?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;I said, what&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; A brown haired boy asked. Jaejoong had seen him around every now and then, he was always climbing trees and playing ball with the others on the other side of the field, where the baseball diamond was.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Cooking&rdquo; Jaejoong said going back to his handful of mud.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Cooking?&rdquo; the boy asked squatting next to Jaejoong, poking at the mud on the ground.</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Jaejoong nodded paying full attention to the mud, &ldquo;Umma always dose this the she&rsquo;s making bread, and I wanna make bread too, but she won&rsquo;t let me, she says the kitchen isn&rsquo;t for little kids to play with&rdquo; He staked the flat slab on top of another and picked up another handful.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">The browned haired boy did the same, mimicking Jaejoongs&rsquo; movements, but not very well.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all wrong!&rdquo;Jaejoong stopped placing his mud pie back in the mud and grabbing the others hands. &ldquo;Like this&rdquo; He guided the other&rsquo;s hands moving and shaping the mud as he pleased until it came out perfect. &ldquo;Like that.&rdquo;He let go.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; The other said grabbing another handful and starting over.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">They spent the whole day like that, and then the next and the next until it became a habit of them meeting up at the park and playing in the mud. The two became friends quickly, always together. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&lsquo;You&rsquo;d never see one without the other&rsquo; one neighbor remarked once.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">One summer&rsquo;s night at the age of 7 or 8 he proposed, saying that one day he was going to marry Jaejoong when they grew old and he happily accepted. He had said something about his appa telling him that if he really loved someone and they loved him back they would get married.</span></span><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">At that young age he didn&rsquo;t know what the meaning of <i>&lsquo;Love</i>&rsquo; was&hellip;and after all these years, he still doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</span></span><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">It wasn&rsquo;t until high school that things started to change. The other had joined numerous clubs, got himself a girlfriend and just didn&rsquo;t have anymore time to spend with him. Getting bored and lonely Jaejoong also busied himself, joining the cooking club and then taking cooking classes, after school, and making new friends.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">They began to drift apart, further and further until they didn&rsquo;t even see each other at all most days, until all they could say was a simple &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; and nothing more, until they drifted so far they became complete strangers.</span></span><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Jaejoong put the book down deciding to take a walk and get some fresh air. Before he knew it he was at the caf&eacute;. He knew he wasn&rsquo;t supposed be there and they knew he wasn&rsquo;t to be there, it being his day off and all, but he never could stay way from the place for more than a day.</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">He entered, ignoring the sighs and smirks he got from his all-knowing employees. Of course they wanted to stop him and send him right back home to rest, but with this manger of theirs&hellip;it just couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">He put on an apron, covering his black cotton pants and baby blue shirt, and started cooking. Five hours later, at 9:00 when all the employees headed home Jaejoong stayed behind to lock up. He gathered the plates and utensils putting them into the dishwasher.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">He was on the last table when he heard the <i>&lsquo;ting</i>&rsquo; of the bell. He turned around to greet the new costumer but ended up freezing in place eyes widened, mouth gaping open. The other chuckled, smiling from ear to ear just like Jaejoong remembered. Jaejoong found himself giggle slightly covering up his sweet smile with one hand, just like Yunho remembered.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Hello stranger&rdquo; Jaejoong welcomed.</span></span></p><p><br /></p></lj-cut><br /><br /><br /><b>A/N:</b> Another really old fic that I don&#39;t mind posting.

Music flooded the open streets, bursting out of night clubs and into alleys filling their ears. From techno to Hip-Hop and Rap, Jazz to Pop, Rock and Roll, it didn&rsquo;t matter. It was where Yunho was,<i>well</i></span></span>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">his mind anyway. His body, unfortunately, was trapped in a large mansion miles away from the fun. Normally his parties weren&rsquo;t that boring, but then again this wasn&rsquo;t</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;his&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">party anymore but another one of his fathers&rsquo; little ideas to help Yunho meet the person he would spend the rest of his life with. In other words: a party to find his future wife. His mother had commented saying it was romantic but it was annoying really. Yunho was only twenty-two, he was still young. He wanted to hang out with his friends, party,</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">date</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">. He didn&rsquo;t care for Jung Inc. or the fact that he would inherit the company someday, which was the whole reason his father was doing this in the first place.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Yunho sighs, backing away from the large hallway window. He walked down the empty corridor, stopping when he was face to face with the wide double doors. On the other side was his&mdash;more like his fathers&rsquo;&mdash;costume party. Closing his eyes Yunho took a deep breath. Once he stepped through those doors he was no longer</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jung</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Yunho, but</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Prince</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Yunho.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;There perfect!&rdquo; Ji-hye clapped her hands together.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Are you sure noona<sup>1</sup>?&rdquo; Jae asked.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yes, and don&rsquo;t call me noona! For tonight it&rsquo;s unni<sup>2</sup>! U-N-N-I~!&rdquo; She lectured.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Okay okay</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">unni</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&rdquo; Jae now stood looking in mirror. &ldquo;Dose this really look okay?&rdquo; This was the first time Jae doing something like this and was bothered by the feeling of getting caught.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It looks fine! Stop worrying already.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Ji-hye stepped closer to Jae and put a reassuring hand on Jae&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry so much. Just have fun. Remember, I&rsquo;ll be there with you, and so will Su-Dae and Chung-Ja.&rdquo;She stung her favorite silver heart locket around Jae&rsquo;s neck, and then combed her fingers through Jae&rsquo;s raven hair. She knew her dongseng<sup>3</sup></span></span>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">well enough to know what was wrong. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be fine&rdquo;, she repeated, &ldquo;No one will find out&rdquo; Her voice came out soft, calming some of Jae&rsquo;s nervous.</span></span></p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">One hour, one hour and twenty-six minutes since Yunho had entered the room. Eighty-six minutes&hellip;five thousand, one hundred and sixty seconds, which was exactly three hundred nine thousand and six hundred milliseconds&mdash;but then who was counting?</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">When the song ended Yunho quickly detached himself from his current dance partner, a Korean Cleopatra. She clung on for a moment but eventually got the message. The next song started and already the next girl was approaching. This time it was an Arabian princess. Yunho turned the opposite way; he couldn&rsquo;t bear to take another dance. He disappeared behind the white lace curtains and out the balcony door.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Beyond the white French doors was a balcony, a garden balcony. It was Yunho&rsquo;s favorite place. In the city of Seoul many stars are fake, but the real ones&mdash;the truly real ones, could be found there. He often went there to relax.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Yunho navigated his way through the jungle of potted and planted orchids, blooming flowers and shrubbery of all kind. Exactly in the middle of the garden was a circular fountain, the perfect place to view stars.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Stopping dead in his tracks, Yunho stared. He didn&rsquo;t expect to see anyone up there. By the moon&rsquo;s light he saw the silhouette of a woman, judging from her dress. As he walked closer he could see her more clearly. Short waves or her brown hair hugged her pale face, her white frilly dress swayed with the cool breeze and at that moment Yunho deemed her very pretty and in the back of his mind he secretly thanked his father for arranging this party.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;May I sit here?&rdquo; He asked. Startled she jumped, when she looked his way, her cheeks tinted pink, and nodded. &ldquo;Do you like to star gaze?&rdquo; Another nod, another question, and before long, Yunho wondered if this conversation was going to go anywhere. She kept to herself. She didn&rsquo;t look at him, but fiddled with a loose string on her dress, which, Yunho thought; she found more interest in then in him. He was about to give up when his one of his favorite songs came on, a song he knew all the steps to. &ldquo;Would you like to dance?&rdquo; He asked.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She hesitated but then murmured, &ldquo;uh&hellip;here?&hellip;now?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You can hear the music all the way out here so&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off. Shyly she took his extended hand.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She was a horrible dancer! She couldn&rsquo;t move with the music like Yunho could. Her steps were all wrong and her movements were awkward. It was as if she had learned the dace the day before, only to forget everything. It didn&rsquo;t help that with every mistake she made at least three more. Yunho couldn&rsquo;t help but laughed at her level of elegance, ballroom dancing was defiantly not her thing. Her face burned with embarrassment after the song ended. She made an attempt to leave, but Yunho wouldn&rsquo;t let go. Oh no, he saw this as a chance for them to get closer. The next song played and he took the lead, happy to teach her the dance moves. With each song she relaxed more and more.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Their last song was a slow song. The kind where young couples, swaying back and forth, hold each other in their arms. One arm gripped tightly around her waist, the other caressed her face. With his thumb he petted her soft skin. His princess&rsquo;s arms hung loosely around his neck and later dropped to his sides to hug him. The two stayed like that long after the song ended. They swayed to the beat of each other&rsquo;s rhythm, lost in the deep eyes that captured them both. They came closer and closer until their lips touched; an innocent brush on the lips. At that point Yunho thought she wasn&rsquo;t just pretty but beautiful. The two kissed and kissed and kissed until their lips their lips turn swollen.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Yunho mumbled in her ear.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&hellip;Jae&hellip;&rdquo;she replied reluctantly.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Jae&hellip;&rdquo; Yunho repeated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; came a hushed whisper.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">GONG, GONG, GONG</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">, the clock struck.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;Is it that time already?&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jae panicked. The clock struck once more.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; Yunho asked. Jae let go of him and backed way.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Ah yea&mdash;no&hellip;I mean I&mdash;I &hellip;&rdquo; She looked back at the open window, &ldquo;I&hellip;I have to go&hellip;&rdquo; Jae didn&rsquo;t bother to explain and in her haste didn&rsquo;t notice the silver pendent slid off and fall.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">That night Yunho didn&rsquo;t sleep. His mind&mdash;and heart&mdash;raced when he thought of her, his Cinderella. She disappeared without a trace and in the place of the glass slipper a heart shaped locket.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Yunho opened the locket. His face lit up when he was the photo inside. &ldquo;Jae?&rdquo; He asked to no one in particular. &ldquo;&hellip;no&hellip;&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t her. This one was a boy, a pretty boy, but a boy non-the-less.</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;Why did she give me this?&rsquo;</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Maybe their twins&hellip;&rdquo; He thought out loud. It didn&rsquo;t matter to him. All he cared about was finding his princess and if this picture&mdash;twin or not, could lead him to her, he didn&rsquo;t care. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Yunho to think up an idea that</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;would not fail&rdquo;</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">. He took out his cell phone and took a picture of the photo in the locket. At the bottom he texted: &ldquo;Find him&rdquo; and sent it to all the contacts on his phone. He knew his friends. They&rsquo;d try their hardest to help and find this mystery man and if they couldn&rsquo;t they&rsquo;d pass it on to all of their friends and so on and so forth. Someone was bound to find him, somewhere, and when they did word would eventually get back to him. Yunho was confident of that. He would find his princes in no time.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">About a week of waiting, an impatient Yunho finally got a reply. &ldquo;333 Lion Lane&rdquo; it read. Yunho didn&rsquo;t know where that was but if it was where she was, he was going to find out.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">When the door bell rung Ji-hye was the first to answer. Jaejoong waited in the next room pretending to watch TV. &ldquo;Yes? Who is i&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Um&rdquo; Jaejoong recognized that voice instantly.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;How&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He thought.</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;How did he&hellip;?&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He asked but already knew the answer. He&rsquo;d gotten one too&mdash;a text, a lot of them actually. The moment he had dreaded had arrived. He didn&rsquo;t think it would be so soon though. A month of two was his guess. Clearly the meeting had made more of an impression on him then they thought.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a girl named Jae. Do you know here?&rdquo; His voice seemed unsure.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I don&rsquo;t think I know the girl you&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo; Jihye stated.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; this time he sounded disappointed. Jaejoong could imagine the look on his face.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;But&rdquo; Ji-hye paused, thinking of a way to phrase her words, &ldquo;I think I know who you&rsquo;re looking for&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Ah, really?&rdquo; He replied quickly. Jaejoong could tell he was excited. This only made it harder for him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Ji-hye left Yunho at the door and walked to into the living room of their apartment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you~&rdquo; she stretched the last part, playing with the &ldquo;you~&rdquo; in a sing song voice.</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jaejoong&rsquo;s stomach turned, he</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">really</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">didn&rsquo;t want to face him, not now. &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t budge.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Get up&rdquo; his noona commanded.

He saw Yunho at the door. &ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; he half waved.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jaejoong had taken them to the playground near his apartment complex. He sat on the swings swaying hack and forth but not so much to actually lift his feet from the ground. Yunho, who he didn&rsquo;t dare look at, sat on the big plastic white spotted, green ladybug dome. He faced the opposite direction from Jaejoong.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; he started, &ldquo;The girl named Jae, you know her?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;kinda, in a way&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Is he your sister or something?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Or something&hellip;I don&rsquo;t have any</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">sisters</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">named Jae&rdquo; He quickly added, &ldquo;The only one close is Ji-the, the one who answered the door.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Huh? You&rsquo;re related?&rdquo; She looks nothing like you though.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re adopted, all nine of us&hellip;&rdquo; Jaejoong clarified.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; Yunho replied. What else could he say? &ldquo;The how do you look so much alike if you&rsquo;re not twins? Do you know where I can find her?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yeah, I know exactly where.&rdquo; He could have easily denied this but he didn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t lie, especially not to those he loved most.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Really&rdquo; He perked up like before, &ldquo;Where&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; Jaejoong said quietly.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Yunho asked looking around, obviously not understanding Jaejoong. There was no one around.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jaejoong sighed. &ldquo;The reason why she looks so much like me is because&rdquo; pause here, &ldquo;&hellip;because she is me.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m Jae. My full name is Kim Jaejoong.&rdquo; He turned to meet Yunho&rsquo;s eyes. Judging by the look on his face, Yunho was shocked, but then it turned into something else. Jaejoong&rsquo;s stomach churned. He didn&rsquo;t like being looked at like that and didn&rsquo;t expect to like the reply he was going to get from the other.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Stop kidding around,&rdquo; Yunho said, he certainly wasn&rsquo;t.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; Jaejoong looked away.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He&rsquo;s not kidding</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">. Yunho was stunned. Here he was, expecting his princess, the same beauty she had been the night before. He expected the same short silky hair he had ran his fingers through thousands of times the other night, the same tiny waist he clung to and the same pretty fingers that clung to him, which of course the one standing in front had. He just expected the girl he&rsquo;d fallen in love with that night and thought of every night after. Yunho was indeed disappointed. He was sad and mad and felt a sick, sick to his stomach. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d lost sleep over this person&hellip;this</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">guy</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">, this guy who had probably deceived him as part of some kind of cruel joke&hellip;or worse. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he kissed such a person.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Jaejoong decided to break the silence. &ldquo;I&hellip;it wasn&rsquo;t meant as a joke. Honestly&hellip;&rdquo; He knew what Yunho was thinking, his face showed it all.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Then why?&rdquo; His question came almost in a whisper.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Why did he?</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">In truth he didn&rsquo;t know it himself. He didn&rsquo;t know what came over him to go along with his sisters in the first place. He didn&rsquo;t know what came over him when he agreed to go to the party, especially dressed like that. It was a costume party but he doubted they meant for him to dress as a girl. Maybe it was all those comments of how he looked so girly&mdash;enough to pass for one. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he finally said.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t&hellip;you&rsquo;re not&hellip;&rdquo; Yunho struggled to find the right words.</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jaejoong let of a quiet laugh, &ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t normally dress up like that. I might be though, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s probably only you&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It I said I&rsquo;ve always loved you, I&rsquo;d be lying. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on going that far, actually, I didn&rsquo;t plan on meeting you either. It just&hellip;happened. And I think I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">like you</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">They stayed in silence and eventually Yunho left. Jaejoong didn&rsquo;t mind. No, that was a lie. He did. What he said was true. He really did like Yunho. He was all Jaejoong thought about &ndash;dreamed about&mdash;for the past week. Ji-hye and the others teased him about it a lot, though he didn&rsquo;t mind. He didn&rsquo;t care. But as Yunho rejected him, even in as few words a he had, he felt like throwing up, badly. He held his stomach but his heart hurt the most. It ached. He wanted to cry, and then realized he already was.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Maybe he should have lied and told Yunho he didn&rsquo;t know her, or that his Jae had died somewhere, like he felt like doing.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">A day passed, two days, three four, five then a whole week. Then two. It didn&rsquo;t matter how much time had passed by, he still couldn&rsquo;t forget. What had happened to his beautiful Cinderella? He often found himself thinking.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">What happened?</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;She turned into a guy, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It was selfish, Yunho knew, but still he couldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;d already debated that statement in his head. It always came up,</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;You could&rsquo;</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">. Then comes the question,</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;Then why?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because you&rsquo;re a jerk, because you&rsquo;re human&hellip;Because you&rsquo;re scared.&rsquo; &lsquo;Scared of what?&rsquo; &lsquo;What others might think?&rsquo; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">he never cared for such things.</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;What others might say?&rsquo; &lsquo;No&rsquo; &lsquo;Might do?&rsquo; &lsquo;NO NO NO&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">that wasn&rsquo;t it, that defiantly wasn&rsquo;t it.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;Then what?&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The voice in his head had grown impatient.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">And so had he.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Why was he so scared anyway? It wasn&rsquo;t that his princess had turned into a prince&mdash;well maybe before it mattered, but not anymore&mdash;and he already knew ton of not-so-straight- people. His best friend was one of them. All his parents needed was for Yunho to find happiness for them to find happiness,</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">so then what</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">?</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">His beauty wasn&rsquo;t a beauty for anything. Sure she&mdash;he was good looking, but he also had a soft side to him. He doubted anyone who gazed up at the stars so pensively could be a bad person. The way he blushed and made Yunho blush, smile and made Yunho smile, it all seemed so&hellip;so right. And lastly when he told him he liked him he got this weird feeling. At first he thought of it as disgust, but that wasn&rsquo;t it. He found that out while still with him that day, but instead of admitting what exactly he was feeling he left.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Now he was willing, at least he&rsquo;d like to think too.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent:.5in;""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;why?&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jaejoong didn&rsquo;t expect to see his again. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Jaejoong asked not bothering to step out of the door way. Couldn&rsquo;t this guy just leave him alone?</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Yunho muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; He looked up at Jaejoong. His face heart sank.</span></span>&nbsp;<i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&lsquo;Had he been crying?&rsquo;</span></span></i>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jaejoong&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot. On impulse Yunho moved closer to the other. Jaejoong took a step back but allowed Yunho to close the gap between them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Yunho repeated.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Stop it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; He pounded against Yunho&rsquo;s chest, trying to pull away but the harder he pushed the tighter Yunho&rsquo;s held on. Jaejoong eventually gave up.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I was thinking&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You&hellip;me&hellip;fairytales&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Fairytales?&rdquo; Jaejoong looked at Yunho.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Yunho nodded, &ldquo;Cinderella mostly.&rdquo; Jaejoong didn&rsquo;t say anything, &ldquo;I was thinking, if you were the beautiful princess, I would want to be your prince charming and live together with you happily ever after&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent:0.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jaejoong buried his face in Yunho&rsquo; chest, smiling against his shirt, &ldquo;Pabo<sup>4</sup>, this isn&rsquo;t a once upon a time story&rdquo; He hugged Yunho&rsquo;s back, &ldquo;And besides, what if I wanted to be the prince?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Words:</span></span></b>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">(you probably already knew)</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">1 Noona &ndash; Korean term for addressing an older female; used by males</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">2 Unni &ndash; Korean term for addressing an older female; used by females</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">3 Dongseng &ndash; Korean term for addressing someone younger then you</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">4 Pabo &ndash; Idiot in Korean</span></span></p><p></p><br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><b>A/N: </b>this is a really old fic. like I wrote it 4 years ago for an English project.

</p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your boyfriend&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; Baekhyun snickers and Jongdae gives him a look.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my <i>boyfriend</i>.&rdquo; He hisses back for what seems like the millionth time. Baekhyun rolls his eyes; a slight smirk is playing at his lips. &ldquo;Whatever you say Jonggie.&rdquo; He says and goes back to packing up. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Jongdae&rsquo;s look turns into a glare, but he can&rsquo;t hold it for long and decides to pout instead because he is not amused. No one <i>ever</i> believes him when he says that Yixing isn&rsquo;t his boyfriend, though he thinks it would probably help if he stopped blushing when he said the word <i>boyfriend</i>. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baekhyun snorts when he sees Jongdae and Jongdae thinks that maybe he should also stop making stupid faces.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;See you tonight?&rdquo; Baekhyun asks. Jongdae has to think about that one.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Probably not&hellip;&rdquo; His gaze travels outside, to the hallway. Class is over and most of the students have already left. Yixing is standing just outside the door. Jongdae smiles when he sees Yixing, waving back when the older boy looks his way. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Baekhyun outright laughs. <i>Not your boyfriend you say</i>, his expression says, but Jongdae chooses to ignore him and together, they leave the classroom.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Baekhyun has OHC, an online gaming club Jongdae knows he loathes, but he continues to go. Jongdae didn&rsquo;t understand <i>why</i> at first, when Baekhyun told him he had joined. He&rsquo;s known Baekhyun for forever&mdash;they met in the last year of middle school and became closer after realizing they were both going to the same high school&mdash;and could personally testify against any and all of Baekhyun&rsquo;s blasphemous claims of loving WoW (possibly the only MMO he knows of). As far as Jongdae knows, the two are not compatible. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">What&mdash;or <i>who</i> are compatible are Baekhyun and Chanyeol. The two were becoming very close lately. They aren&rsquo;t in the same major, but make sure to take the general studies classes together whenever they can. Jongdae often wonders if he should feel jealous or angry that Chanyeol is invading his best friend territory, but somehow, he doesn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s Chanyeol goal.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Baekhyun is already a forth of the way down the hall when he says: </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, Friday!&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;I know, I know.

I won&rsquo;t forget. I&rsquo;ll go pick it up this afternoon.&rdquo; Jongdae assures him, waving goodbye. He <i>knows</i> how much of a big deal this thing is to Baekhyun. He smiles and secretly thinks it&rsquo;s cute that Baekhyun would suffer sitting a room full of gaming nerds for Chanyeol.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Oh! And bring your <i>boy</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Bye Baek!&rdquo; Jongdae yells before Baekhyun can finish his sentence and huffs as Baekhyun leaves, laughing.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on Friday?&rdquo; Yixing asks, both amused and confused at Jongdae&rsquo;s reaction. He adjusts the strap of his guitar and holds Jongdae&rsquo;s books while the younger boy zips up his coat.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Chanyeol&rsquo;s congratulations party.&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">They leave the building and Jongdae explains how Baekhyun&rsquo;s throwing a surprise party for Chanyeol who had recently landed a modeling jig for the university. His face could now be seen on both the front page and the student connection&rsquo;s page of the university website. It wasn&rsquo;t such a big deal expect in the eyes of their little group (especially Byun Baekhyun&rsquo;s). </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a small part too.&rdquo; Jongdae chuckles. He holds his thumb and index finger up, trying not to shrink the already nonexistent space between them. &ldquo;But Baekhyun&rsquo;s totally into it. He was more excited when we heard Chanyeol was chosen than Chanyeol was.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">A gust of wind blows their way and Jongdae uses it as an excuse to move closer to Yixing. Silently rejoicing when Yixing puts his arms around him, Jongdae continues with his story. They make their way to Koffee Kat, a quiet little caf&eacute;/restaurant on campus. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">It was January, almost February and Jongdae and Yixing found themselves indoors most of the time. Gone are the lazy afternoons chilling outside in the campus courtyards and squares. (At least for now and Jongdae hopes MAJS will return next semester.) The winter semester is almost half way through, along with Jongdae&rsquo;s sophomore year in University. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind going downtown after, do you?&rdquo; He asks as an afterthought. &ldquo;I have to get a cake.&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Yixing says &ldquo;no&rdquo; he doesn&rsquo;t mind and Jongdae asks, with his cheeks tinted pink, if Yixing would like to go to the party with him, maybe. He doesn&rsquo;t ask him to be his date because it&rsquo;s not that kind of party, he tells himself.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">The possibility of Yixing saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to him doesn&rsquo;t even cross his mind. It feels like second nature to have Yixing with him every other day, when neither of them are working or have any other pressing engagements. Yixing is his Monday and Wednesday afternoons and evenings, evenings only on Fridays and all day most Sundays.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">As Jongdae&rsquo;s already told Baekhyun (as well as Kris, Minseok, Chanyeol, Kyungsoo, Joonmyun, Sehun, and Kai) Yixing is not his <i>boyfriend</i>. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">So what if Jongdae chose his classes this semester based on how much time he would get to spend with Yixing? (He&rsquo;s still hasn&rsquo;t gotten over the fact that World History was only offered Fridays at 4.) And so what if he&rsquo;s only taking Chinese again this semester because he wants to understand what Yixing says when he speaks to his friends in Mandarin, and because it&rsquo;s just another reason to spend time with Yixing, and because Yixing always complements Jongdae when he gets something right, and because when he doesn&rsquo;t get something right Yixing would always go over it with him slowly (very slowly) and he can listen to Yixing&rsquo;s sexy Chinese speaking voice and watch as his lips purse, forming strange words, and when his tongue&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Earth to Jongdaeeeeeeeee~&rdquo; Yixing pinches his cheeks, stretching them out, though he looks more amused than actually mad. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Owowow&mdash;Yi<i>xing</i>&mdash;ow~&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Pay more attention next time.&rdquo; Yixing sticks his tongue out and lets go. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;I was though&hellip;&rdquo; He rubs his cheeks, and puffs them out. &ldquo;Just not to what you were saying&hellip;&rdquo; He mutters the last part.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Yixing pinches one of his cheeks and Jongdae whines:</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; They both laugh.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Yixing orders for both of them and an hour and a half passes with them eating and Yixing helping Jongdae do homework.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"">

Two of Yixing&rsquo;s friends are walking up to their table and Jongdae recognizes them instantly. The taller one, Tao, is a freshie and the other one, Luhan, is a junior. Jongdae&rsquo;s seen both of them more than a couple of times. They&rsquo;re also Kris&rsquo;s friends (he knows <i>everyone</i>) and Jongdae&rsquo;s hung out with them a couple times. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d find you here.&rdquo; Luhan sounds pissed and Jongdae leans back in his chair. &ldquo;&lt;The library? Three o&rsquo;clock?&gt;&rdquo; Luhan says in rapid Chinese. Yixing just looks at him, confused and Jongdae cringes because Luhan looks even more pissed then before. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;The project? &lt;Remember scatterbrain?

The kid has dark circles under his eyes (courtesy of Comp 101 and Korean Studies 1) and has this whole fuck off aura going for him (one of the reasons why Jongdae was frightened of him the first time they met).</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Hey.

Do you like movies? I have tickets to that one movie Sunday.&rdquo; Jongdae nods and Tao takes two tickets out of his pockets.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;A s&mdash;se&mdash;&lt;senior&gt; gave them to me. &lt;But I can&rsquo;t go.&gt; I have um&hellip;&lt;what do you call it?&gt; A workbench?&rdquo; Tao says in mixed Korean and Mandarin. Jongdae just smiles and accepts the tickets. Tao is from China (where in China, Jongdae could not say) and had not yet mastered Korean.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;He means a workshop.&rdquo; Luhan clarifies.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; That made much more sense. &ldquo;With Mr. Lee again?&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Mr. Lee was one of the Korean language professors.

Thanks gege.&rdquo; Jongdae smiles, though even if Tao doesn&rsquo;t get through all the stations at the workshop, Jongdae will probably treat him to ice cream anyway. He is only one year older than the kid, but Jongdae can&rsquo;t help but want to act like a hyung around him. Tao is the kind of kid he wants to spoil. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Good Luck okay?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Okay ge.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Turning back to Yixing, Luhan says, &ldquo;&lt;I still can&rsquo;t believe how you managed to land someone as cute him&hellip;&gt;&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Jongdae is all smiles even though it&rsquo;s pretty obvious he doesn&rsquo;t really understand what&rsquo;s going on at times. The boy&rsquo;s one of the more good looking people on campus and it makes it cuter that he hasn&rsquo;t realized it yet (though Luhan doubts he ever will). He has a good personality, and if he wasn&rsquo;t already painfully attached to Yixing (and Luhan still doesn&rsquo;t understand how <i>that</i> happened), Luhan wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking him to a small dark corner of the dorms and teaching him a few things. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Tao seemed to like him anyway.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;&lt;<i>Shut</i> <i>up</i>.

It&rsquo;s just past 6:30 when they make it to the cake shop. It&rsquo;s a small corner shop that Jongdae likes to get all his cakes from. He&rsquo;s not really a sweets person, but he could eat their cupcakes for forever and he enjoys the little cartoon characters that come on each cake.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo; The lady behind the counter calls.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">Jongdae looks through the cakes on display.

It&rsquo;s not that Kris&rsquo;s apartment building is that far from campus, but Jongdae thought he would have at least have had time to think up a plan in the allotted time. It doesn&rsquo;t help, though, that all that was going through his head for the past fifteen minutes was &lsquo;omgomgomgomg&rsquo; and &lsquo;whatamIgonnado whatamIgonnado whatamIgonnado whatamIgonnado&rsquo;. Lost in his own world, he didn&rsquo;t notice it when they reached the campus or that Yixing, too, was off in his own little world. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Jongdae says when they stop outside his dorm room.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; text-justify: inter-ideograph;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: georgia,serif;"">&ldquo;Um&hellip;ah, so&mdash;so&rdquo; Yolo, he repeats to himself. <i>Just do it.

It was chilly that night and he had a ton of homework he hadn&#39;t started on (not to mention that History test he had the next day), but for some reason Suzaku wasn&#39;t stressed out like he thought he should have been. It could&#39;ve been the fact that he was currently hammered and the possibility of flunking History hadn&rsquo;t quite filtered through his brain. He wasn&rsquo;t thinking about how he was supposed to have been home hours ago or that anyone could&rsquo;ve easily walked in on them&mdash;them being him and Lelouch. He wasn&rsquo;t doing much thinking in fact, not when he was so close, or when Lelouch was doing that thing with his tongue, or when h&mdash;he&mdash;<i>fuck</i>.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suzaku shuttered and hissed, biting the bottom of his lip in a weak and unsuccessful attempt to stifle a groan. His face and ears were flushed; breathe came out in visible puffs. It took a while for his mind to come back to him; to tell him to tuck his man bits into his pants again and zip up his fly. Lelouch was already on top of him by then, nibbling along his jawline, before bombarding his mouth will little kisses that turned into a full-blown make out session just as soon as Suzaku was able to kiss back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had one hand around the other boy while another slid down beneath his jeans, passed his boxers until it was fondling the warm skin underneath, making Lelouch shiver and let out little soft moans that were always pleasing to hear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to do more, but didn&rsquo;t think that Lelouch would appreciate baring Suzaku him to the world (especially in the middle of the night and at an utterly unromantic place as on top of the slide in a playground) so they stayed like that for a couple minutes, before&mdash;and Suzaku didn&rsquo;t know how it happened or who did what&mdash;they were somehow losing their balance and sliding down. Surprised, Lelouch gasped and clung onto Suzaku, fast and hard. He let out a scream that was far too soft for a scream and Suzaku&rsquo;s hold on him tightened, never letting go until they reach the bottom of the tube and unceremoniously dumped on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pfft&mdash;&rdquo; It started out as giggles and soon they were both laughing. They laughed and laughed and even though it wasn&rsquo;t that funny and they didn&rsquo;t really know just what exactly they were laughing at, laughed until they were out of breath and their stomachs hurt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quieted as quickly as they began because all of sudden nothing was funny anymore and had Lelouch&rsquo;s eyes always been that shade of purple? That spark in his eyes could&rsquo;ve have been from the way the light from the streetlamp (which wasn&rsquo;t really a streetlamp because it was positioned along the path that snaked through the park) was hitting them or maybe it had always been there? Suzaku couldn&rsquo;t tell. All he really knew at that moment was that he loved the way Lelouch&rsquo;s eyes crinkled at the corner and narrowed a bit when he smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come home with me?&rdquo; Lelouch asked, but it wasn&rsquo;t a question and more like a command when he kissed like that. Suzaku allowed himself to be persuaded though, and after more kissing and groping on his part, the two untangled themselves and got up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Lelouch asked, shrugging on his school bag. He smoothed over his hair and uniform, fixing the little imperfections he could, a little annoyed (even in his inebriated state) at how he couldn&rsquo;t un-wrinkled his uniform or get his hair to lay flat again. Suzaku, who didn&rsquo;t bother trying to fix himself, laughed and grabbed hold of the other boy&rsquo;s hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><br />wrote it a while ago, posted it on ff.net and decided to post it here too"

Duo remembered because it was cold that day. The curtains were drawn open and the cold air seemed to seep into the room and coat everything in a layer of frigid coolness. He had slept most of the day away under the warm covers, waking up every now and then, and had only gotten up to go to the bathroom once. Noin had come in the afternoon he thought. He wasn&rsquo;t so sure. The sky was overcast and white with clouds and unchanging throughout the day. Rain fell every now and then, stopping for a couple minutes at a time then continuing for a couple more hours.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The click of the door woke Duo up and he sat up once he saw that it was Noin. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo&rdquo; she greeted. &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo; She was seated in her usual seat, in the chair by the bed. He yawned and told her he was fine, like he always was. Noin smiled like she always did and Duo thought there was something different about it, something missing in it. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was a moment of silence in which it was clear that Noin was debating over what to say next. She didn&rsquo;t look at him and fiddled with her hands, a nervous habit she had admitted to and something she rarely did when she was with him. He wondered if she would ask. He would have told her, if she asked. If he was truthful with himself he would admit that he wanted to tell her. A month had passed and he was still here. He knew that there was nothing left of his old life and Duo was never one to sit around all day waiting for something to happen. With the healing of his body almost complete restlessness was starting to set in. He had to leave. He had to get out of the hospital. He had to go&hellip;He had to&hellip;Where <i>did</i> he have to go?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">With a sigh she said:</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo, about the other night&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Noin?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t want to go there. Not yet. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the investigation? Did you find out anything new?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She became silent again at the mention of the investigation and gave him a look that wasn&rsquo;t quite pity, maybe sympathy or something akin to it. He tried not to get mad&mdash;tired not to show that he was mad, like he often did when she made that face. Duo Maxwell did not need anyone pitying him. He could take care of himself as well as any adult could. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin sighed again. She seemed to be doing that a lot recently. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going fine Duo. Nothing much has changed anyway. Why do you ask?&rdquo; She asked and there was something in her voice that told him she thought it was an odd question. Maybe it was. Maybe there was something in <i>his</i> voice that suggested that there was something wrong. Maybe it was because he wouldn&rsquo;t look her in the eye or because of what happened the night before. Duo didn&rsquo;t know. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo didn&rsquo;t think it was an unusual question. He&rsquo;d asked about the investigation the preventers were conducting on the Doctors more than once. He sometimes brought it up when he was curious or bored but always paid attention, granted he paid more attention to Noin herself than what she was actually saying but he got the gist of what was going on. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">From what Noin had told him, they were no closer finding out the cause of the explosion or what the Doctors had been doing before it. She had told him yesterday morning that the team had discovered something new and possibly crucial. She hadn&rsquo;t told Duo what exactly.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sally Po had also visited him that afternoon. Not unusual, but peculiar considering she had given him a check up the day before yesterday. She had taken his blood. He didn&rsquo;t know why because there was no need to, though he did have an idea. His wounds&mdash;the ones she knew of&mdash;were purely physical but Sally Po was a scientist, like the Doctors. He knew she would find, if she hadn&rsquo;t already, the cause of his abnormal health, how exactly his body could repair itself so quickly. Maybe she already knew, maybe she didn&rsquo;t. Duo could only guess, though his guesses tended, more often than not, to be dreadfully accurate. He wondered if that too was a result of his mechanical-self or some innate sense of intuition completely unique to himself.</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><br /></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I can help you.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She began as her mind processed what he had said, &ldquo;Duo&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I want to help.

Duo glared at her. This wasn&rsquo;t what he wanted. Why wasn&rsquo;t she listening? He had the information she needed. The investigation could&rsquo;ve been completed in far less time than it would take them to finish if she would only let him&mdash;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo,&rdquo; she called his name soft, like she always did when she was trying to wake him up or when she was trying to bring him back from his own thoughts.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He closed his eyes and tried to control himself.

What&rsquo;s going to happen to me and Heero?&rdquo; He asked. They couldn&rsquo;t keep them in the hospital forever and the two boys had nowhere to go. They had no parents, no families, no relatives, no nothing. He wondered if they were going to put them in foster care or some other type of program similar to it. He hoped they wouldn&rsquo;t. He hoped Noin wouldn&rsquo;t. She was the closest thing he had to a friend and he liked her. It would be sad not to see her again.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Her eyes widened in surprise, and then narrowed and hardened. Concern mixed with relief.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">One of the things Duo loved about Noin was how expressive she was. She wasn&rsquo;t the type to hide her emotions. They played out on her features and in the way her body moved. Any person could read what she was feeling at any single moment if they knew where to look. Her lips curled up and her eyes narrowed a little when she was happy or amused and about to laugh. They tightened and her whole face hardened when she was serious. Her eyes narrowed and sometimes it was in that same gentle way. Sometimes it wasn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t exactly freeze, but her body stiffened and she seemed taller somehow&mdash;bigger, like now.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo, both you and Heero are going to be okay I <i>promise</i> that. I&rsquo;m not going to let anything bad happen to you. <i>Either</i> of you.&rdquo; When she spoke, the words came out tense, her voice strained&mdash;with what exactly Duo didn&rsquo;t know but there was an edge in her voice that reacted with something in him&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know <i>what</i>&mdash;and gave a vague sense of recollection that flicked on and went out in a blink. It was a nameless, formless haze of emotion that rose from deep inside somewhere&mdash;deep inside himself?&mdash;and felt old like the old discolor photographs that lay in the back of photo albums or in-between the yellowed pages of the little tattered books that people liked to carry with them and depicted old people and old places and old feelings and ideas that are long gone but have left a residue of themselves in places where you can&rsquo;t reach and in the form of this feeling, this haze.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It made him sick but it was different from the sickness that came from Heero and more like the sickness that came from the hurt of loosing G but this had nothing to do with G. It was something before G, something he had forgotten and was coming back&mdash;<i>no</i>. Not coming back. Making itself known. But what <i>was</i> <i>it</i>? what was it&hellip;? Duo blinked and breathed.

The other lightly combed through his hair, smoothing over and pulling back stray strands. &ldquo;What is up with the two of you?&rdquo; She asked but it wasn&rsquo;t really a question. Both her hands cupped his face, forcing him to look her in the eyes. &ldquo;First Heero,&rdquo; Duo&rsquo;s left eye twitched, &ldquo;now you.&rdquo; Noin smiled that sad pitying smile that made him mad but he let her continue. &ldquo;Duo. I know. I know you can take care of yourself. You&rsquo;re stronger than you look. Okay, but you&rsquo;re still a kid, Duo, you&rsquo;re only <i>twelve</i> <i>years</i> <i>old</i>.&rdquo; She laugh-sighed. &ldquo;What kind of adult would I be if I&mdash;if I ignored that? Duo, you&rsquo;re a kid. I&rsquo;m the adult. Let me act like one.&rdquo; She hugged him. &ldquo;Let me take care of you.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo stilled, stunned. What was he suppose to do now? Hug her back? Stay still? Would she be offended if he didn&rsquo;t hug her? Then, tentatively, he let his hands cling to the sides of her Preventers jersey and they stayed like that until Noin pulled back. He tried not to think about how warm she was or of the new feelings bubbling inside of him. She held him at half her arm&rsquo;s length and asked:</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; For a moment, Duo stared at her, taking in what she had just said and then nodded.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I want to join Preventers.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Will you tell me about what&rsquo;s going on between you and Heero?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He hesitated before nodding. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Her eyes dropped and it was clear she didn&rsquo;t want this. In spite of herself she gave him a curt nod and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to the Chairwoman about it.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Then she left.</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><br /></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo liked Noin. He liked talking to her and he liked her talking back. He liked being around her and looking at her and liked the way she told him stories and brought him little gifts. But sometimes&hellip;sometimes she brought things out of him, made him feel things he didn&rsquo;t know or like. He thought that sometimes it was better without Noin because without her he didn&rsquo;t have to deal with all these things he didn&rsquo;t know or want or like.</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">***</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It was a week before Noin came back with an answer and Duo was certain it was afternoon this time. The sun was high in the sky and beat down on him from his spot on the bench. The day had started out sunny and Duo, having been in his room for most of the week, decided to take a walk </span></span><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">through</span></span><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;""> the</span></span><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;""> hospital</span></span><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;""> grounds. He stopped in the courtyard and had lunch</span></span><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">, </span></span><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">a sandwich one of the hospital cafeteria ladies made him</span></span><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;""> (they had grown fond of him from his more than frequent visits and made his lunch almost every day in exchange for a visit) and had grown too lazy to move so he curled down for a nap, letting the sun warm him and cover him. Noin found him there two hours later. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo, wake up. We have to go.&rdquo; A hand petted him, flattening down his hair. It was a good thing Noin smelled so good, he thought and officially woke up. He wondered if she would be this relaxed around him when he told her. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Did she&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin sighed and nodded. Her expression morphed into the same tired look she had given him a week ago but Duo couldn&rsquo;t be bothered by it this time. He had gotten what he wanted.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The walk to the meeting room was a relatively lengthy one. They went through full hallways and empty hallways and up and down elevators. It wasn&rsquo;t long before they were out of the hospital and into the main building (Preventers Headquarters was composed of many different buildings and sites, Duo had learned from one of his many conversations with Noin. The hospital was its own building but also connected, like most buildings, to many others though a labyrinth of lengthy passageways and corridors. The main building was in the heart of the base and housed offices, laboratories, training facilities and other rooms so secret Noin couldn&rsquo;t tell him) and in and out and up and down all over again. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Throughout their journey, Noin talked and talked and talked. Most of it was about etiquette and what to expect from this meeting-slash-interrogation and how to behave in front of the chairwoman Une. How you should always look her in the eyes and hold your position and how it was very important not to get intimidated by her&mdash;and if Duo didn&rsquo;t know better he&rsquo;d have thought Noin was actually frightened of the lady. All this talking held Duo&rsquo;s attention for about the five minutes before he started thinking of just how different Noin looked in her uniform. She had always worn a sundress or other casual clothes when she visited him. Sometimes she wore her Preventers jacket. She looked bigger in her uniform, taller, and more imposing then she ever had while in civilian clothing&hellip;</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo?&rdquo; Noin paused. She had stopped in front of a door with her hand on the doorknob about to turn it when she noticed Duo wasn&rsquo;t with her anymore. Noin turned around and there he was, frozen at the corner of the hall. He was pale and looked terrified she thought. <i>What</i> <i>happened</i>?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; She slowly moved towards him, careful not to frighten him any further. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; She asked again and as she was about to put her hand on his shoulder, he slapped it away, glaring at her and then at the door which opened only moments later. Sally stood in the doorway with another boy behind her.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Heero?&rdquo; Heero didn&rsquo;t look at her and simply glared at the Duo.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It was happening again, she thought. Whatever <i>it</i> was it was happening all over again. Noin looked to Sally and was met with the same alarmed expression that told her the other woman was thinking along the same lines. Silently she hoped that Sally had an idea to fix this.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Is everything alright out there?&rdquo; Noin cursed under her breathe. She hadn&rsquo;t thought the chairwoman had arrived yet. The meeting was to officially begin in twenty minutes time. The Chairwoman always arrived on time. She had other appointments and meeting and rarely was she early for one. Was she that interested in the boys? Noin hadn&rsquo;t believed it when she agreed to both Heero and Duo&rsquo;s proposals and so quickly at that. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;ah&mdash;&rdquo; Sally cleared her throat, &ldquo;Chairwoman Une, I think it would better if we moved the meeting to room I-12. &rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;<i>I-12</i>?&rdquo; the voice inside questioned. &ldquo;Dr. Po, that&rsquo;s all the way in the east wing.&rdquo; Her voice was stern but she sounded curious, suspicious. This was supposed to be the interrogation of two hospitalized children who had information that could likely help the investigation progress much faster than it already was. A regular meeting room would have been fine so why was her head Physician insisting that they move into one of the official interrogation rooms and specifically I-12, on such short notice?</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin&rsquo;s gaze leveled on Sally, her eyes had the same question in them but Sally shook her head. She couldn&rsquo;t answer now. She only had a feeling about this and didn&rsquo;t know if this would even work. She placed a hand on Heero&rsquo;s head and when the boy shrugged her away she grabbed him and lifted him up so he looked like an oversized toddler in her arms. He thrashed around but she held on as tight as she could. She motioned for Noin to do the same. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a hunch but I think this might work. My team&rsquo;s been experimenting with something we think might help.&rdquo; There was a pause, a sigh, and then the buzz of activity, papers shuffling, and chairs moving, before the chairwoman said:</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Very well.

She would take Heero.</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Room I-12 was located in the east wing of building 301 and was separated from its sister, room E-12, by a one-way mirror. Room I-12 was white and bare save an overhead light, a small square table and the four chairs that sat around it. There were cameras hidden and positioned in a way as to capture every possible angle of the room and every possible move the occupants made and sent packets of data to the many computers in room E-12 in the form of heat, inferred, and visual images to be viewed, processed, and analyzed. The room had one of the best, if not <i>the</i> best, surveillance systems in preventers. Preventer&rsquo;s security was at its finest in and out of the room because although room I-12 was almost never used it had held some of the most cunning and coldblooded criminals known to preventers. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo hadn&rsquo;t like the room from the moment he stepped foot in it.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin led him to the table and sat him down. They had taken a detour to the cafeteria and Noin purchased a variety of snacks and sweets. She had given him a juice box and a smile and Duo was thankful she hadn&rsquo;t said anything. They had then made their way to room I-12 with Noin explaining how they would be in that room while Sally and the Une and other agents would be in the other room and how all Duo had to do was answer their questions. She didn&rsquo;t mention Heero or how he had blacked out just moments ago.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It had come as a shock because even though Duo now knew Heero would be joining them (he doubted Sally would let the chance of experimenting on them pass) Duo still jumped when the door opened and Heero and his dark hair and glowering blue eyes and clenched fists entered the room. He didn&rsquo;t dare move when those eyes turned to him and matched the other boy&rsquo;s glare with one of his own. Noin was by Heero&rsquo;s side the moment he entered and tried, in vain, to get him to move closer so he could sit at the table. He didn&rsquo;t move, and instead&mdash;Duo flinched and drew back when he did this&mdash;sat cross-legged on the floor beside the door. Noin handed him a juice box also and a box of sweets similar to the box that was sitting in front of Duo. Noin returned to her seat beside Duo and for a few seconds there was nothing but silence, tense and uneasy. The tension was thick in the air, overpowering and so suffocating it was a wonder no one chocked. What disturbed Noin was how the two boys watched and reacted to each other. They were wary of each other, extremely cautious and in movement as well. When one boy moved another would flinch and draw back as if they were in a standstill in a fight, each boy waiting for the other to make a move. This wasn&rsquo;t right, she thought to herself. Two young boys should not have to have this much hatred, this much <i>fear</i>, between them. Not the first time, Noin felt hot anger bubble up inside her. She hated the Doctors for what they had done to these boys.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Heero? Duo? Are you guys okay in there?&rdquo; Sally&rsquo;s voice was coming from all over and the boys, startled, broke their stare for a second to glance at the mirror but said nothing. Noin nodded for Sally to continue. She was there as a mediator and to break off any fights or physical confrontations&mdash;judging from how they were regarding each other Noin doubted that would be the case.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sally continued by restating the purpose of the meeting and went on to introduce the key figures that were in the room with her. There were a couple agents who were part of the investigation and Chairwoman Une.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Are you feeling alright?

Any second now, he was going to fade away. He knew it. His breath came out short and uneven as he let the anxiety take over him. Nausea swam in his belly, slowly clawing its way up into his throat. His vision blurred but he hadn&rsquo;t lost sight, not yet. He wanted to throw up. He wanted to scream but stayed frozen under the careful watch of those blue eyes. He wondered if Heero was feeling it too, the begging of the sickness.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo?

They were soft and flexible and he shivered from the cold touch of his fingers. He could still feel, still touch. He looked about the room in new wonder, taking everything in as if it were the first time he was really seeing it. The room hadn&rsquo;t changed.&nbsp; It was still white and bare and there was Heero sitting on the floor five feet in front of him. Touch, sight&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">But it was quiet, <i>too quiet</i>, so surly sound was&mdash;no. There was the <i>tap</i> <i>tap</i> <i>tap</i> of Noin&rsquo;s short, clean cut nails on the surface of the table. There was the hum of the air conditioner and a faint murmur and scratching of noise that floated through the speakers that seemed to be everywhere in the room.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Wilderness, apples, candy, cookies mixed with gunfire and salt and sweat and steel that faded into the prickly sterilized scent that seemed to cling to <i>him</i>&mdash;to Heero. His mouth was too dry to taste anything.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Touch, sight, sound and smell.

Nothing save the nausea, anxiety, anticipation and if he were to be honest with himself&mdash;fear. He didn&rsquo;t understand but the more he thought about it the more his head hurt. It was a dull pounding that had seeped into his mind without his knowing and stayed there <i>throb</i> <i>throb</i> <i>throbing</i> like the steady beat of a drum.</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">In what seemed like a nanosecond something new had happened and the tension in the room subsided. Noin watched in curiosity (she was sure she wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was curious) as both boy&rsquo;s seemed to be lost in their own worlds. They were touching things such as skin and clothing and looking around the room. Duo had even closed his eyes and sniffed&mdash;sniffed what exactly she did not know. Noin threw a look at the mirror and then at the boy beside her.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Heero?

What had her team found out during experimentation and was it harming the boys? Though they didn&rsquo;t look hurt Noin never knew when it came to the boys. Appearances weren&rsquo;t everything. She knew that well. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo?&rdquo; carefully, Noin placed a hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.

They make us faster, stronger. It&rsquo;s not only our senses that get messed up. Everything else goes too.&rdquo; It was like unplugging a computer. Once the power shut off, they ceased to function.

Duo didn&rsquo;t like to think about the pang in his chest when he thought of G so he gave a little nervous giggle.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;They were working on the&mdash;your, um, problem when they died?

Was he serious? He couldn&rsquo;t have meant&mdash;but Heero nodded.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You have tried to kill him?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Heero said as if it was nothing.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;<i>Why</i>?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way to make it stop.&rdquo; The more she heard out of him the harder she had believing that she was hearing him right. Noin stared wide-eyed and then turned her gaze to Duo. He had his hands clenched and was glaring at the other boy.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t been trying either.&rdquo; He muttered and there so much malice in his voice. Noin placed a hand on his shoulder in an effort to calm him as well as to steady herself. Were these boys really trying to kill each other? It was ridiculous. She couldn&rsquo;t believe it, shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to believe it but there was evidence of this. She thought back to that day a month ago. When she had told Duo of Heero&rsquo;s whereabouts the boy had ran out of the room and launched himself at the other boy. He had the same malicious glare he had on now but had gone down screaming before he could&rsquo;ve done any damage to Heero. In the similar incident a little more than a week ago the two boys had been found unconscious in the Duo&rsquo;s room. Duo was in bed while Heero lay on the floor. It looked like he had collapsed. When the nurse examined the boys she found marks that weren&rsquo;t-quite-bruises in the shape of tiny hand prints on Duo&rsquo;s neck. They had mysteriously disappeared hours later, no doubt due to the boy&rsquo;s ability to heal rapidly. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Then she had a thought. They couldn&rsquo;t have thought this up themselves.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Did the Doctors tell you this? That killing each other was the only way to get rid of the&mdash;the buzzing?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Both boys looked at her processing what she had just said. Duo wanted to laugh but couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to and as a result his facial features contorted to an expression of pained amusement.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t even let us in the same room after it started&hellip;&rdquo; He thought back to how cautious G and J always seemed to be when they met. He would rarely see Heero during those visits. Sometimes he wouldn&rsquo;t have seen him at all. But he always felt the other boy. He always knew he was near and it drove him crazy. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;We thought of it.&rdquo; It was a mutual agreement, though neither of them had discussed it prior. Duo had been the first to attempt anything and when that failed Heero had gotten the idea and the next attempt was his. Finding opportunities had been difficult since, after the first three attempts, both G and J started getting nervous and wouldn&rsquo;t let them within a mile of each other. It had gotten to the point where when the doctors met one of the boys would be on a job. A chance of the two meeting was uncommon, rare. Slowly the animosity between the two was beginning to dwindling and then the explosion happened. That day was the first time in years the two had felt each other&hellip;and also the day there were to lose everything. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo told Noin all of this except for the last part. He had never told anyone what G was to him. He had never told anyone how much he looked up to G, how much he loved him. Not Heero, not Noin; partly because he saw it as a weakness and partly because she had never really asked about him. Duo couldn&rsquo;t understand why she hated G so much. G had never used him. G had never lied to him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;""></p></lj-cut><br /><br />Not revised ver."

I think that was taken just after I enlisted. He already had his four stripes when we met.&rdquo; She looked at the picture, Duo looked at her. Her expression went soft, almost melancholy but not quite and Duo wondered what her training days had been like. Happy? Hard? Sad? Did she wish she could forget them? Like he did? Sometimes.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She chuckled and startled him. &ldquo;We were so mischievous bad then. It&rsquo;s taboo to be in a relationship with a superior&rdquo; She explained then leaned in and cupped her hand to the side of her mouth as if she was telling him a secret. &ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; She was laughing now. &ldquo;We use to sneak out to all <i>kinds</i> of places. We went to the movies a couple of times, got caught once when we were heading back. I had to wash the bathrooms for two months and help in the kitchens. It was <i>horrible</i>.

She stared at the picture again and rubbed her thumb against the image of her husband lovingly. It was intimate and a little sad.

She laughed again and it was a little nervous-excited laugh that came out smooth and was pleasing to hear.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She was grinning at him now and asked:</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Do you have anyone you like?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I like you Noin.&rdquo; She laughed.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Thank you Duo. I like you very much too, but that&rsquo;s not what I meant. Do you have anyone you love? Anyone you remember?&rdquo; <i>From</i> <i>before</i>? He appended and could almost laugh himself. There was no room for something as pointless and as ridiculous as love. What was love anyway but a foolish desire for foolish people which, in the end, only got you killed (or badly maimed if you were lucky).</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He shook and told her this. She laughed again&mdash;he was starting to like her laugh; it was beautiful and made him want to laugh too&mdash;and told him that that was not necessarily true. Love was a beautiful and wonderful thing when shared and she hoped that one day he would find someone to share it with. He doubted it but didn&rsquo;t argue. He was getting bored and was tired of talking about love. They moved on to the next photo. </span></span></p><div style=""border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in;""><p style=""text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in;""></p></div><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">***</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Ahhh&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Ahhh&rdquo; He opened his mouth.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Tongue, under the tongue&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She threw the stick away in the trash can and told him to stay still as she examined his eyes&hellip;his ears&hellip;his chin.

It would take most people months to heal from something like what you through. I&rsquo;m happy to say that you&rsquo;ll be out of here before you know it.&rdquo; She smiled at him again and turned back to her clip board.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo couldn&rsquo;t decide whether or not he liked Sally Po. She was his doctor and very good at her job, judging from all the certificates that hung in her office, but she always treated him like a kid. It was very annoying. The professor had never treated him like a kid. He made him feel important and like an adult. He knew things that adults didn&rsquo;t know and did things that most adults couldn&rsquo;t do. On the other hand she gave him candy after every check up so he couldn&rsquo;t always be annoyed with her.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sally Po was the same height as Noin and also worked for the Preventers. She wasn&rsquo;t a pretty as Noin but she was pretty he supposed. She didn&rsquo;t wear much make up, but always enough to make her lips as red as cherries. Her eyes were blue, but much lighter than Noin&rsquo;s. Her hair was blonde and always in two big twists that he often had the urge to pull when she got too close.</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s bothering you?&rdquo; She put down her clipboard. He had her full attention.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo swirled that caramel toffee in his mouth and shook his head no. Nothing out of the usual was bothering him anyway. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was still buzzing in his head, which he had resolved never to tell her about, that seemed to be getting louder all the time. He tried to ignore it most of the time. He slept, read the books Noin had brought him. He loved it when Noin visited him. It made it easier to ignore the noise. She always found ways to distract him. He also liked visiting Sally. Really, he liked anywhere that wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near the room across the hall. The buzzing weakened as more distance was put between him and&hellip;the person who occupied the room across the hall.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He still had headaches, but that was caused by the buzzing. Separation would alleviate them. He still felt anxious and nauseous but he was growing strong enough to ignore those too. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">His body was coming back to him. He was no longer in pain and could walk again. He was well enough to leave, should have left a long time ago, but there was that problem of having nowhere to go and no one to return to. The professor had never gone through this with him. He had never told him what to do if he died. Naturally, they had both assumed that Duo would have died before him as age didn&rsquo;t matter in their particular profession.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; She had grown used to this by now.

No doubt Sally noticed. She would be making notes about this in her journal later. &ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t remember anything about him?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">That was another constant with both Sally and Noin. Neither of them knew anything about Heero at all. Apparently the other boy was staying silent also, but then again Heero had never been much for words. They had figured that the two boys knew each other. They were both at the lab, though on opposite sides, when the explosion happened&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It didn&rsquo;t take long for both women to notice how Duo reacted when Heero was brought up. There was always something small like wincing or freezing up or shutting his eyes, or gritting his teeth. He tried to control it but couldn&rsquo;t. Heero was the only thing about Duo that he couldn&rsquo;t control.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo knew that Noin was also paying regular visits to Heero and felt reassured in knowing that he was getting questioned too.

Chairwoman Une&rsquo;s office was large and well furnished. There were large ceiling-to-floor windows that always let in bright sunlight. There was a casual seating area on the left, a couch, two arm chairs and a coffee table. There were little things, like potted plants and fresh cut flowers, which made the office feel almost homely, yet the framed certificates and awards that hung on the wall gave it that professional feel.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Doctor Po.&rdquo; Lady Une greeted her from behind her desk.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Chairwoman Une.&rdquo; Sally nodded a greeting to Noin who was seated in one of the arm chairs facing the director. Sally plopped down on the seat next to her. She placed both folders she had been carrying on the desk for the chairwoman to inspect.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re healing just fine.&rdquo; Sally went on without being prompted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very peculiar really. I predicted at least four to five months but it looks like they&rsquo;ll be able to be discharged in a couple weeks. Duo still looks a little sickly though. I think he might develop another fever, I&rsquo;m not sure yet.&rdquo; Sally crossed her arms in front of her chest, something she did when she was thinking.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Une flipped through the documents.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it before. They were both defiantly battered and bruised when they arrived. I&rsquo;d say they were just healthy but they&rsquo;re healing a little too fast. Heero&rsquo;s leg was broken. He had two cracked ribs, a fractured wrist and a twisted ankle. Duo was in a similar state. It should&rsquo;ve taken months but it&rsquo;s only been one so far. I&rsquo;d say they would have already been set to leave if that incident three weeks ago, the one where Duo went into Heero&rsquo;s room, hadn&rsquo;t occurred. That is also odd. They only saw each other and, from Agent Noin&rsquo;s reports, they both had severe panic attacks. I&rsquo;ve never seen this before.&rdquo; She reiterated.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about their blood. It&rsquo;s thicker than normal and darker. I believe it&rsquo;s been mixed with another substance, but my lab hasn&rsquo;t figured out exactly what yet, though we do have a theory. We&rsquo;re going to have to run more tests to be sure but we&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s nanites. That&rsquo;s the only explanation, as improbably as it is. We believe that somehow the Doctors have found a way to implant them in a living human body and have the nanites function properly.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Une was looking at her now and Sally went on.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;This is completely uncharted territory. We thought they were just normal boys when they first came in. We only took miniscule samples. We&rsquo;d have to do the tests to be sure but if we are.&rdquo; If only her lab could somehow prove that nanotechnology could be used effectively and that wasn&rsquo;t all just science fiction nonsense&hellip;If only they had access to such technology. It would revolutionize both the scientific and medical communities, not to mention the whole Preventer organization. They could build better, stronger, faster soldiers and would be more affective in policing the Earth and the colonies. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time for physical therapy. Like I said, they&rsquo;re healing nicely, and we could run tests on how the possible nanites affect their ability to function.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Une nodded. Sally knew she was thinking the same thing she was, though perhaps less impressed with the Doctors than Sally was. The Preventer Organization was her child, both figuratively and literally. It had been started by both the chairwoman and her late husband who had served as the chairman before she took over the organization. Une was always seeking new ways to improve the organization. It was one of many qualities Sally, and many others, admired about her.</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Agent Noin?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;There was nothing at the lab.&rdquo; Noin began. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t find anything of any importance in the rubble. The explosion had wiped out most of the lab and the fire had burned down the rest but we think we have a lead. There is evidence of another location in which one of the Doctors&rsquo;, J, we think, frequented. We think it was his personal lab, judging from how frequent he went there. Either that or his home.&rdquo; Noin shrugged. &ldquo;Really the only leads we have are those boys.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;And they still don&rsquo;t recall anything?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;No but I&rsquo;m sure they know more than they&rsquo;re letting on.&rdquo; Sally nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they remember each other.&rdquo; Noin went on. &ldquo;That day, three weeks ago, when I told Duo about Heero I&rsquo;m sure he knew who I was talking about. I didn&rsquo;t say his name but he became very still, almost frightened. I&rsquo;m positive they remember each other after that. He practically ran to Heero when I told him about how we had found another boy in the building but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll tell us anything.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with both of them these past few weeks and I have to say, they&rsquo;re not bad kids. I think they&rsquo;re a little lost though. I&rsquo;m positive the Doctor&rsquo;s took care of them. We haven&rsquo;t found any family members, not even a long lost aunt. There haven&rsquo;t been any missing children that fit their description. I&rsquo;ve had Jack check the records dating all the way back to eight years ago but nothing.&rdquo; She shook her head.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;They need someone to take care of them. They&rsquo;re only twelve.&rdquo; She was begging now and she would have to choose her next words very carefully. She had never been able to stay detached when children were involved.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Agent Noin, you do understand that it is against preventer code, and highly unwise to become too attached to any person or persons involved in the investigation? You have already been informally visiting those boys. I&rsquo;ve heard reports of you bringing them gifts even.&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Une&rsquo;s piercing brown eyes were now trained on her. Noin took a moment to calm herself and let the feeling of being dissected pass. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time the Chairwoman had scrutinized her, she doubted it would be the last, though she doubted she would ever get used to it. It felt like those eyes had the power to see through you, and into you. Une knew everything that went on in her organization. It was how she liked to run things. She was like a mother with eyes in the back of her head and always knew if you had taken a cookie from the jar when you weren&rsquo;t suppose to.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yes, Chairwoman, I understand.&rdquo; Noin wouldn&rsquo;t give in, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t suggesting that I take care of them but nevertheless we can&rsquo;t just leave them in the hospital forever. Sally said they would be able to be discharged soon and I have spoken to a few people who would be more than willing to take them in. They&rsquo;re all connected to the organization in some way and we wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about security issues communications issues that could arise if we put them in some foster home. The boys are also part of the investigations so it would be beneficial to us if we were to still have some connection with them. Social Services won&rsquo;t be so keen on us hanging around them when they&rsquo;re discharged.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin gave Une a look of her own. Relief washed over her and she let out a breathe she didn&rsquo;t know she was holding when Une sighed, indicating her to go on.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><div style=""border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in;""><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in;""></p></div><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">***</span></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The room, like all others at this time, was dark. Shades and shadows of furniture stretched along the floor and the walls. The window was open and the boy stared out at the clear night sky and the glowing moon which could not be seen from his own room across the hall. It was bright and beautiful and frightening. He always felt like it would swallow him whole if he stared at it for too long.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The boy made his way towards the single bed on the other side of the small room, right where he knew he would find the other. Duo looked small lying there, smaller than usual but then again, even though they were the same age, he had always been smaller than Heero, though not by much. J had always told Heero that he looked younger than his age, Duo even more so. And lying there, on the bed, he looked far younger than his twelve years. He looked so pale and fragile and breakable like a worn toy. It would be very easy for Heero to place his hands around that slender neck and squeeze then <i>SNAP</i>! He doubted it would take much effort. Or time. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Without thinking, Heero placed a hand on Duo&rsquo;s pale neck.

The pulse was stronger, faster. He wanted to press down harder, and harder, passed the flesh and into warmth of the blood underneath. Instead he stopped and breathed in, then out. He traced his finger back up the neck, to the center, and smoothed his hand over the soft skin. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He stared, transfixed. Duo&rsquo;s skin was so soft and pale and bright in the scant light. His neck was so thin and looked so fragile, so <i>breakable</i>. All Heero would have to do was squeeze and that was it. Duo would be gone. And so would the noise and the buzzing and the sickness. Gone. Vanished. And he would be free of all this.

Heero knew Duo too was suffering from the same illness. He felt the nausea, the anxiety, the anticipation and terror of seeing the other. He knew Duo heard the buzzing. It was like white noise and tolerable only when they were apart. It stayed in the back of his mind like a hazy memory, more often like an annoying fly that wouldn&rsquo;t go away. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It was different when they were close.

Not anyone. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Heero took another deep breathe. Had it been this warm when he first entered the room? He wondered. His mind was swarming. The buzzing was getting louder and louder. It pushed itself into the edged of his mind and into every nook and cranny, seeping into his consciousness.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Heero do it.

He stared at the ceiling and lay there, trying to keep as still as he could, trying to overcome every tremor that shook his body. He didn&rsquo;t look at Heero. Wouldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;<i>Do it</i>.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t want to be consumed by the blue. &ldquo;<i>Do It.</i>&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t want to fade away. &ldquo;DO IT!&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was screaming.

Touch he clung to. He felt the suffocating dampness and humidity that seeped into his skin, into his throat and made everything blue and blur. It was cold. It was hot. It was cold and then hot and cold and hot and cold until he was in the place where hot and cold melted together, where they was both and neither at the same times.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT&rdquo; The words repeated in his head even though sound was gone. It was strong. Stronger than the violet and the buzzing. Texture had faded but pressure was still there he thought. Maybe. He tried. He tried to squeeze but&nbsp; pressure was fading too and it wasn&rsquo;t long before touch finally left him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">In the end the last sense to go was smell. A strong pungent odor he couldn&rsquo;t identify. There was the cool, sterile scent of a lab that always sent shivers down the back of his neck. There was the stale and metallic scent that reminded him of sterilized and carefully sharpen needles.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was an earthy sent that lingered and smelled familiar, like fresh cut flowers and blue skies but also dirt and mud and leaves. Wilderness. It was like being a kid again.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">A mild and pleasant scent that floated to the top like bubbles. Blistering cold steel like the blade of a dangerous knife that lay underneath.

<p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Guitar Boy Comes on Mondays.</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; "">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Guitar boy comes on Mondays. He sits on the fountain steps, hunched over, with his acoustic cradled in his arms, playing songs that make Jongdae want to jump in a sing along.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae is seated at one of the scattered tables in the courtyard, close enough to hear the music, yet far enough to feel somewhat excluded. (He likes his personal space.)</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He listens, sneaking peaks every now and then at the boy with the guitar, wondering if he should just stop pretending to study and move closer to get a better view. A crowd has already formed around the fountains and other musicians have joined in, turning guitar boy&rsquo;s afternoon practice into an impromptu jam session. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Following the theme, the next song, like all songs previous, is an acoustic version of a current pop song. The song itself, Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t like&mdash;it&rsquo;s too overplayed&mdash;but he listens anyway. Guitar boy and crew&rsquo;s version is different, more fun and lively with brief intermissions for solos and Jongdae finds himself singing along quietly to himself, making up the parts he doesn&rsquo;t know. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He tells himself to get closer, to join in and sing along, like most of the crowd is already doing, but he never does and an hour later he has to run off to Comp 102.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; "">

</p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Mondays are Good days.</span></span></i>
</p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">When asked about his freakishly cheery disposition, Jongdae simply replies that he loves Mondays; however he doesn&rsquo;t think his friends quite buy that. A love for Mondays does not explain the random smiles and sometimes sighs, that far off look that graces his face whenever he thinks no one is looking (but in reality they&rsquo;re all watching for it), or his sudden inability to sit still and focus for the last half hour of Calc. They wonder where he disappears to during the two hour free block before Comp 102 and why he&rsquo;s suddenly asking for notes he was busy daydreaming to take down.&nbsp; (Jongdae was usually the one who let others borrow notes from.)</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The guys joke about how he&rsquo;s gone crazy, about how the pressure of taking two math classes in one semester has gotten to him. Sehun&rsquo;s been formulating a theory that his mind&rsquo;s been taken over by aliens and Kai agrees, though they&rsquo;ve recently had a scifi movie marathon and possibly not in their right minds. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Baekhyun and Kyungsoo are responsible for Jongdae&rsquo;s secret boyfriend. Even though Jongdae won&rsquo;t tell them the details they&rsquo;re pretty positive he&rsquo;s a cross between Kim Bum and Ricky Kim&mdash;someone tall and manly because apparently Jongdae looks like the type you want to take care of&mdash;who&rsquo;s hard working and treats Jongdae kindly but has outrageous working hours.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae mocks them back, but secretly he wishes it were true, though he could think of someone better than a Kim Bum/Ricky Kim crossover.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Chanyeol just wants Jongdae to concentrate more in Comp so he can go back to being the borrower in and not the borrow-ee. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Kris is the worst. Not because he mocks him, Kris never mocks Jongdae, quite the opposite actually. Kris always has on one of his sly, half smiles, and that I-know-something-you-don&rsquo;t expression on his face when Jongdae&rsquo;s weird Monday behavior or his nonexistent boyfriend is brought up in conversation. Jongdae ignores it for the most part, but then again, for the most part his thoughts are occupied.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">So when asked about his odd Monday behavior, Jongdae replies that he simply likes Mondays&mdash;which is not untrue. Mondays are when he spends his afternoon free time in the courtyard by the art department, sitting at his table (he&rsquo;s officially claimed it) listening to what has been dubbed the Monday Afternoon Jam Session (at least in his head that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called). It can&rsquo;t be helped that his eyes drift towards a certain guitarist whose name Jongdae still doesn&rsquo;t know, or the fact that he finds the way guitar boy&rsquo;s fingers glide up and down the neck of the guitar extremely sexy.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Even though he&rsquo;s not an art major, Jongdae still appreciates the look of total concentration in guitar boy&rsquo;s expression, those dark mystifying eyes, the way he purses his lips when he plays&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">When he opens his mouth, Jongdae is careful to listen to every word&mdash;though the lyrics are sometimes thick and heavily accented and Jongdae can&rsquo;t quite understand what is being sung. Mostly, Jongdae listens just to hear his voice. It&rsquo;s low, not quite deep, husky and smooth, and always in perfect harmony with his guitar or whatever instrument is currently playing. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">During these Jam sessions, Jongdae never joins in, preferring to sit and watch and listen. During particular moments, when it seems like Guitar boy is looking right at him, Jongdae wishes everyday was Monday. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; "">

</p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The Revenge of Comp 102</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; "">
</p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; "">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jongdae asks, not sure he heard right. &ldquo;</span><i style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; "">Test</i><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; "">?&rdquo;</span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Baekhyun nods slowly, &ldquo;yeah, the test&hellip;you know, the one she&rsquo;s been talking about all last week?&rdquo; Jongdae shakes his head and slumps into his chair. He hadn&rsquo;t heard anything about a test. He hadn&rsquo;t been in class on Wednesday, having gone to the museum with his art history class, and had been sick on Friday. Monday&hellip;he just hadn&rsquo;t been paying attention on Monday. He hadn&rsquo;t had any time to go over Chanyeol and Baekhyun&rsquo;s notes over the weekend either, both his physics and Calc professors had made sure of that. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;There there&rdquo; Baekhyun pats his friend on the back, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still time before class. I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Me and Chanyeol were going to go to the library to study anyway.&rdquo; Baekhyun shrugged. Prof. Han&rsquo;s tests are killer and they aren&rsquo;t all top students like Jongdae is (was?).</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">True to his word, Baekhyun helps Jongdae study. He&rsquo;s made flash cards of all the terms and goes over the notes section by section with Jongdae. With the help of Baekhyun and Chanyeol, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for Jongdae to learn most of the material. He&rsquo;s still iffy on semantics and syntax, but he doesn&rsquo;t think there will be that many questions relating to those two on the test. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">They spend the whole two hours in the library, immersed in their studying and it&rsquo;s only after Prof. Han calls time and collects tests that he remembers its Monday. It&rsquo;s the first time he&rsquo;s missed MAJS.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">At first he&rsquo;s pissed off at himself but this whole thing was his fault. He&rsquo;s the one who didn&rsquo;t pay attention in class and he&rsquo;s the one who forgot about the test, so he goes through the rest of the day in a sullen mood, silently cursing the class. He hated literature and would be glad when the semester finally ended so he could take something more interesting, like World Music.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; "">

</p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Kris to the rescue?</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; "">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Hyung, I don&rsquo;t wanna go.&rdquo; Jongdae puffs his cheeks out and glares at Kris. It&rsquo;s Tuesday morning and Jongdae and Kris are at the caf&eacute; down the street waiting for Kyungsoo, Kai and Sehun. Chanyeol and Baekhyun had a club meeting to go to.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae has his arms crossed on the table, his head buried in them. Kris is trying to get him to go to this forum the Chinese club hosts on Tuesdays but he doesn&rsquo;t want to. Still disappointed about not getting to go to MAJS the day before, Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t feel like doing much of anything. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like Kris got the message.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Come on. It&rsquo;ll be fun and you might meet someone new.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jongdae doubts that. He isn&rsquo;t very good at the whole meeting new people business. He either embarrasses himself and babbles on or just doesn&rsquo;t talk at all, but Kris won&rsquo;t care either way so he opts to approach this argument from a different angle. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have to speak Chinese there?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Well yeah, but you&rsquo;ll do fine.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Hyung, I&rsquo;m in Chinese <i>one</i>. I don&rsquo;t know anything! I can barely keep up in that class.&rdquo; He isn&rsquo;t a native speaker like Kris. He can&rsquo;t speak that well and half the time he doesn&rsquo;t even know what his professor is talking about. Shim Laoshi was one of those teachers who believe in complete emersion. She only speaks in Chinese to her students, whether they are in Chinese one or four (and then gets irritated when they don&rsquo;t understand what she was saying).</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a good grade in that class?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Kris rolled his eyes. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Besides this&rsquo;ll improve you Chinese.

He takes Jongdae&rsquo;s arms and unfolds them; holding on to his hands, and says &ldquo;at least do it for me? It won&rsquo;t be that bad and I promise you&rsquo;re going to like it.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae purses his lips.

He knows there are a lot of native Chinese people at the university, but he doesn&rsquo;t expect there to be enough to fill up the entire auditorium. There are also non-Chinese people he kind-of-sort-of recognizes from class and around the campus. The whole forum takes place in the auditorium and the square outside of the building. It&rsquo;s kind of like a party; there&rsquo;s loud music, dancing, socializing and obligatory plastic red cups. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae also never noticed how popular Kris is. There are always people coming up to him, either to ask him questions or just to talk. It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising because Kris was nice and easy to talk to. He also knows pretty much everyone (something Jongdae constantly forgets).</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The forum isn&rsquo;t as bad as he thought it was going to be. He can&rsquo;t understand everything that&rsquo;s said but he does catch little phrases and words. The people aren&rsquo;t that bad. Some of the ones he talks to (all friends of Kris) are patient with him and even teach him a couple new phrases. As much as he hates to admit: Kris is right; he is having fun.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Everything was going well until Kris leaves him. There&rsquo;s something happening inside the auditorium (Jongdae and Kris have drifted outside, into the square) and Jongdae can tell Kris wants to see it, whatever <i>it</i> is. It&rsquo;s cute watching Kris fidget beside him, but in the end Jongdae decides to let Kris go. He knows he won&rsquo;t be interested in whatever&rsquo;s happening inside but doesn&rsquo;t want Kris, who is clearly interested, to miss out on it. When Kris protests Jongdae tells him that he&rsquo;ll be fine and that he doesn&rsquo;t need his gege by his side all the time. He isn&rsquo;t scare, he says, even though that&rsquo;s a lie. He doesn&rsquo;t want to be left alone in a sea of people he doesn&rsquo;t know. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&lt;You sure?&gt;&rdquo; Kris asks one last time.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&lt;Yes ge. Now go&gt;&rdquo; <i>Before I change my mind.</i> Jongdae pushes him in the general direction of the auditorium. Kris leaves, promising to be back as soon as it&rsquo;s over.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;"">

</p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Without Kris and his friends Jongdae feels awkward. He just stands there, looking around at all the people talking and laughing, and doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with himself. He wonders around for a couple minutes, not sure if he should leave, or follow Kris. In the end he decides to take a seat at the circular bench under Willow, a tall tree planted in the middle of the square.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Jongdae looks around and sort of plays with his hands and thinks of how lame he&rsquo;s being right now. He puts his hands on his lap and wills them to stay there, but his will is pretty weak, once he starts looking around he becomes awkward and lame again. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He starts to hum, a nervous habit he&rsquo;s developed over the years (and something he only does when he&rsquo;s alone). He doesn&rsquo;t know what song it is until he gets to the chorus and smiles because it&rsquo;s a song Guitar boy played a couple Mondays back. Jongdae had liked the song, and had looked up the lyrics afterwards. Though that was pretty long ago, he wonders if he still remembers&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He sings quietly to himself.

He&rsquo;s mortified at first. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t think anyone was there. Most of the forum go-ers were concentrated near the auditorium and scattered from there. He can&rsquo;t believe someone actually heard him sing! Jongdae feels his face turn warm and he wants to run away. When he sees who it is, he wants to sprint out of there, but it feels like he&rsquo;s glued down.

By the art building&hellip;the one with the unicorn fountain?&rdquo; When Jongdae doesn&rsquo;t say anything Guitar boy goes on. A blush is creeping up his neck and it looks like he&rsquo;s nervous, &ldquo;I see you there some times, I think. On Mondays&hellip;&rdquo; he looks away, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always studying or something, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; He trails off. </span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">A hundred thoughts run through Jongdae&rsquo;s mind, but what comes out is: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve seen me?&rdquo; Without looking at him, Guitar boy nods.</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Around, yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">What was he suppose to say now?

also not my usual style. I kept forgetting and having to change it from past tense to present tense.
the lyrics are also random but 10 points to anyone who can guess what song it&#39;s from.
I tried but I really can&#39;t resist unicorn jokes but in my defense, it&#39;s an art building, there&#39;re bound to have weird statures and stuff."

"event","Title: Daydreams<br />Pairing: Minkhun<br />Summary: Where Minho has sweet dreams, Nichkhun tries his hand at photography and teaching, Junho writes and composes songs, Chansung becomes a model. Eli is a chef and Kevin is his lovely perfect self.<br /><br /><span style=""display: none; "">&nbsp;</span>Chapter 1.<span style=""display: none; "">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Daydreams 1""><br /><br />The kiss was sloppy, open mouthed. Lips bruising, reddening; tongue darting into the unknown, exploring, discovering, and tasting. Minho&rsquo;s arms clung tightly around the other boy&rsquo;s neck. His hands were squeezed tight into fists. He rocked back and forth in Nichkhun&rsquo;s lap; digging into the older boy&rsquo;s clothed erection and loving the feeling of the other&rsquo;s hardness. All these sensations made him dizzy. It sent his head spinning and his heart wild with excitement. He felt charged; like the high he got after running and he never wanted it to stop. He moaned into Nichkhun&rsquo;s mouth and the boy kissed him harder, faster.<br /><br />Minho &lsquo;<i>hmm</i>&rsquo;-ed, liking the tingles he got when Nichkhun touched him. He felt a hand on his hip and the other on the back of his thigh moving higher and higher all the time. He smiled and wiggled when it squeezed his butt, stopping when those fingers slipped under the waistband of his boxers. The tingles were unbearable when Nichkhun&rsquo;s fingers traced along his bare ass, squeezing and messaging his round cheeks, and finally traveling in between them.<br /><br />He pressed closer against Nichkhun, clung to him tighter when a finger rimmed around his entrance; moaned when a finger grazed over the spot, back and forth, petting him. He stiffened and held his breath. He heard the older boy chuckle. His kisses traveled south. His lips sucked on Minho&rsquo;s neck, teeth leaving small little love-bites. His <i>other </i>hand, with his <i>other </i>fingers, traced circle around Minho&rsquo;s hip.<br /><br />&ldquo;Relax&rdquo; was breathed in his ear and he tried. He let out a shattering breath and tried to relax, to loosen his muscles. He gasped, surprised, relieved when it entered and felt a jolt of sensation. Cold, hot, slippery, wet, sticky&mdash;<br /><br /><br /><br />Minho woke, startled. He sat up on his bed. His breathing ragged and tattered. He stayed still for a few seconds and calmed himself down. He shifted in his sheets, in his boxers. The room felt stuffy. He was sweating and his sheets were too warm and wet.<br /><br />&ldquo;Shit&rdquo; he whispered. <i>Fuck</i>. Not again.<br /><br />He didn&rsquo;t need to look down to see the mess he had made. He cursed again and could only thank the heavens that he was alone. His brother hadn&rsquo;t come home that night. Minho assumed he was staying over at his girlfriend&rsquo;s like usual. He would have died of embarrassment if any of the guys had stayed over and was thankful that Kibum hadn&rsquo;t spent the night.<br /><br />He looked at the cock&mdash;the <i>clock </i>on the nightstand and signed. There was no point in going back to sleep. It was almost time for him to wake up anyway he reasoned, got out of bed and headed straight for the bathroom. He would change his sheets later&mdash;he dreaded the thought of his mother finding them. Right now he needed a shower to cool his head.<br /><br />By the time he was done the bathroom was all fogged up, but he didn&rsquo;t feel any better. He washed his hair and brushed his teeth quickly, ignoring the hard on he was getting trying not to think about his dream. He dressed in a clean pair of boxers and an old shirt. There was no use in getting dressed in his uniform. He had a good three hours before he had to be awake, and five hours before he had to actually be at school.<br /><br />He changed his sheets and took his hamper to the laundry room. Minho had spent more time in the room than he would ever want to spend in a laundry room the past couple months and it was all Nichkhun&rsquo;s fault. If he wasn&rsquo;t so infuriatingly forward and always trying to invade Minho&rsquo;s personal space Minho&rsquo;s life would have been so much better. If Nichkhun wasn&rsquo;t so hard to get rid of or annoyingly sexy whenever he got that stupid grin on his face whenever Minho gave in, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been suffering like this. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been thinking about those lips and how he wanted them on him. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been thinking about how it would feel to have those strong arms hold him or&mdash;<br /><br />Minho glared at the wall. The point was it was all Nichkhun&rsquo;s fault.<br /><br /><br /><br />&ldquo;You look awful&rdquo; Key greeted him and ignored the glare sent his way. He eyed his friend up and down and took note of how haggard he looked. Minho had bags under his eyes, which were red and watery like he was about to cry, and his hair was even more of a mess than usual, sticking out in every direction. His uniform was rumpled and Key instinctively reached out to straighten Minho&rsquo;s tie and collar.<br /><br />&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; came a dry response. Minho raised his arms as Key patted down the wrinkles in his blazer and yawned. &ldquo;I woke up in the middle of the night, couldn&rsquo;t get back to sleep.&rdquo; He shrugged and slapped Key&rsquo;s hands away when they got lower.<br /><br />Key stepped back and gave him a curious look. &ldquo;Nightmare?&rdquo;<br /><br />Minho snorted, &ldquo;You could say that.&rdquo; Key watched his friend&rsquo;s face scrunch up in annoyance and his grip tighten around the strap of backpack but said nothing. Instead he whipped out a comb and went to work on Minho&rsquo;s hair. It was dreadful and he couldn&rsquo;t have any friend of his looking like a zombie. Not in public at least. Used to this, Minho yawned again and leaned on the plastic wall of the bus stop. He closed his eyes and tried to relax but couldn&rsquo;t. All that came to mind were unwanted images of a certain person he didn&rsquo;t want to deal with.<br /><br />The bus came and they boarded. They found seats in the middle. Minho took the window seat and Key sat beside him.<br /><br />&ldquo;So Taemin called last night about&hellip;&rdquo; Key started but Minho only half listened. He was tired and agitated and all he wanted was to go to sleep. He opted to stare out the window at nothing in particular.<br /><br />It was a normal day; dawn and with a gray-blue sky. Patches of white sunlight were blinding when they peaked out behind the clouds, promising a warm sunny day. Minho blinked, closed his eyes for a second and was out like a light.<br /><br />Key pulled him close so Minho&rsquo;s head was lying on his shoulder instead of smushed against the cold glass. He did another one-over and sighed. There was something wrong with Minho but he didn&rsquo;t know what. He had an idea a pretty good idea though.<br /><br />Minho was one of those annoyingly cheery <i>morning </i>people. He woke up at the ungodly hours like five and six in the morning just to take a run around the neighborhood and was even more cheery afterwards. Key was usually the one who looked this drowsy and usually after Minho woke him up but before Minho had forced him out for a run. That bitch. He knew how much Key hated getting up in the mornings.<br /><br />When he had slept over at Minho&rsquo;s the night before Kibum hadn&rsquo;t n0ticed anything wrong. He was a little jumpy when Key told him he was staying over but other than that, nothing had happened. Minho had dragged Key out of bed at the unholy hour of six-thirty for another stupid jog. Key had hit him with his pillow which had led to a vicious pillow fight. Minho had won&mdash;the fucker&mdash;and they had gone for a jog.<br /><br />Absently, Key stroked Minho&rsquo;s hair in thought.<br /><br />Minho had this ridiculously huge crush on Nichkhun Hor-something&mdash;Key could never remember his last name. He doubted he would pronounce it correctly if he remembered anyway. The boy was Thai and had one of those confusing, though amazingly short, Thai names. He was on the youth center&rsquo;s Dream Team, as one of the trainers and went to a local university.<br /><br />Key only knew a bit about the older boy, and though he had seen Nichkhun often when he accompanied Minho to practice, they&mdash;Nichkhun and Minho&mdash;weren&rsquo;t friends. They didn&rsquo;t talk to each other much. Nichukhun was almost always surrounded by other people and Minho always seemed reluctant to go near him, which Key thought was stupid. How was Minho going to get the boy if he was too scared to approach him? Sure, all the girls that surrounded the older boy were pretty, and well, girls&hellip;but Nichkhun was bi so there was always a chance. And sure all the guys that hung around him were all big and buff and good looking and that one guy with the red hair was so incredible sexy, Key&mdash;<br /><br />The point was: Minho still had a chance. Key knew his best friend. Minho could come off as a little standoffish at first but that was only because he was shy. Minho didn&rsquo;t always make the best first impressions, but once he got to know the person he became a whole different person. He was so cute and kind and funny and Key could only hope that Minho had gotten used to Nichkhun by now, but then again Minho was crushing on the boy. Minho wasn&rsquo;t easily infatuated with people but when he was he was usually too nervous to do anything about it. That was usually when Key stepped in. but how?<br /><br />Key frowned. He wasn&rsquo;t good friends with Nichkhun, but maybe it was time for that to change.<br /><br />The bus was approaching their stop so Key woke Minho up. The other boy grunted and pouted and never really fully opened his eyes but let Key lead him off the bus and off to school.<br /><br /><br /><br />&ldquo;So then I was like &lsquo;$#%^&amp;#$*$%@$, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me&rsquo;, and he was like&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No way.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yes way.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;But Jiwon-hyung would <i>never</i>&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Taemin, I&rsquo;m telling you Jinwon&rsquo;s a total&mdash;Minho where&rsquo;re you going? I was about to get to the good part.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;&hellip;ah&hellip;the bathroom&rdquo; Minho called, already halfway to the exit and gaining speed. He waved bye and Key knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be seeing him until after lunch ended. He didn&rsquo;t have to wait long to find out the cause when Kiseop and Dongho came up to their table a little while later.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey guys.&rdquo; They said. Key greeted them with a nod and signaled for them to continue. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Minho? I thought I saw him here a minute ago.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;He&hellip;had to go see the teacher about sometime.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;oh. Is he coming back?&rdquo; Key glanced at his watch.<br />&ldquo;Not likely. You need him for something?&rdquo; Kiseop and Dongho shared a look.<br />&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; Kiseop started.<br />&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t show up at morning practice&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;so we were just wondering it something was up.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;We thought he was sick&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;but then we saw him in at school so&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;we were just kind of&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;worried.&rdquo; They said the last word together. It was like watching a ping pong match, Key thought. They were both so energetic and enthusiastic&mdash;Key didn&rsquo;t know what they were enthusiastic about, probably, since they were always this way, about life&mdash;they kept interrupting each other. Key opened his mouth to say something but another person came to their table.<br /><br />&ldquo;Did you guys find out what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; It was none other than Amber, full time tomboy and self proclaimed soccer star. She was also Key&rsquo;s number one rival.<br />&ldquo;Key.&rdquo; She whipped her hair, executing a remarkable hair flip.<br />&ldquo;Amber.&rdquo; Key did the same, though his hair flip was decidedly less remarkable. He had just styled his hair to get it the way he wanted it and didn&rsquo;t want to mess it up.<br />They narrowed their eyes at each other while Taemin, Jinki and Jonghyun rolled theirs. This whole rivalry thing got tiring after a while. Especially if it was drawn out for years and years&hellip;<br /><br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;to the teacher.&rdquo; Dongho finished.<br />&ldquo;Oh. We&rsquo;ll just have to talk to him after school then.&rdquo; Both Kiseop and Dongho weren&rsquo;t in the same grade as Minho and Amber wasn&rsquo;t in the same class.<br />&ldquo;Why are you guys looking for him? It&rsquo;s this like the first practice he&rsquo;s missed?&rdquo; The three of them turned to Jonghyun and shrugged. They took a seat at the table and Key knew this was going to be along story.<br />&ldquo;Well&rdquo;, Amber began, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a meet coming up and Minho&rsquo;s our best runner so we really need him.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s running three events&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I thought it was four&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Really? Because Taec-hyung told me five.&rdquo; Dongho and Kiseop rolled their eyes.<br />&ldquo;Taecyeon-hyung&rsquo;s always exaggerating&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;yeah and shouldn&rsquo;t you call him &lsquo;oppa&rsquo; Amber?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Shut up Dongho. I don&rsquo;t wanna hear that from you. With the amount of time you cross-dress&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Can we get back to Minho?&rdquo; Key cut in. He did not want to deal with this right now.<br />&ldquo;Right&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Okay&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Ye&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Guys, <i>Minho</i>.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Right&mdash;so we really need him with the meet coming up and everything since he&rsquo;s running the most. It&rsquo;s the last meet of the year and we&rsquo;re tied with those %$#%#@$#$%1 that go to&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;<i>Amber</i>&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;<i>What</i>? They are! So anyway, we can&rsquo;t lose this one.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;And&hellip;&rdquo; Kiseop leaned in and whispered &ldquo;he&rsquo;s kind of been acting weird lately&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Dongho leaned in and whispered &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something wrong with him&hellip;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;And we think&hellip;&rdquo; finally Amber leaned in and whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s something to do with Khun&mdash;hyung.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Khun&mdash;<i>oppa</i>&rdquo; Dongho hissed. Amber hissed back.<br /><i>Interesting</i>, Key thought. He looked to Taemin, Jonghyun and Jinki and could see that they were thinking the same thing.<br /><br />&ldquo;Nichkhun-hyun you say?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah. There&rsquo;s something going on with them. They never talk to each other or anything and when they do it&rsquo;s really awkward. Sometimes Khun-hyun tries to talk to him but lately Minho&rsquo;s just been brushing him off or&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;or when he does talk he stutters or says something weird&mdash;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;or just changes the subject&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment all three Dream Team members, remembering a particular Minho and Nichkhun moment, snorted with laughter.<br />&ldquo;Wha&mdash;&rdquo; Teamin began but stopped when Key put a hand on his shoulder and shook his head. Judging by the instantaneous laughter, it was probably a horrifyingly embarrassing moment Minho would never want to even be reminded of and probably didn&rsquo;t want his best friends to know. Key, having been lucky enough to witness most of them, would tell the rest of the gang later.<br /><br />The conversation continued. It was more talk about Minho and Nichkhun&rsquo;s relationship&mdash;or sad their sad excuse of one, the coming up meet and whether or not Dongho should continue with the Dream Team or stay with his job (they could not reach a decision, but Kiseop and Amber were leaning more towards the Dream Team. It was soccer season next and Dongho had a killer kick).<br /><br />When Amber, Kiseop and Dongho left, Key told the horrible story of how Minho embarrassed himself in front of Nichkhun and the whole Dream Team (aka the <i>Discus incident</i>). They felt horrible for laughing, but the whole incident could&rsquo;ve been avoided if Minho hadn&rsquo;t opened his mouth, or started running, or&mdash;actually he should&rsquo;ve just stood still and looked pretty until Nichkhun had passed.<br /><br />After listening to Key tell the story they all agreed that Minho needed help. They spent the rest of the day brainstorming possible plans that would a) get Minho and Nichkhun together&mdash;both physically and romantically, b) get Minho to relax and not make an idiot out of himself, c) get Nichkhun to like Minho if he didn&rsquo;t already (but who didn&rsquo;t like Minho?) and d) be inconspicuous enough so that Minho wouldn&rsquo;t find out and freak out that his friends were trying to set him up with someone (again) and blab on about how this would blow up in their faces like what happened the<i> Lee Episode</i> (though Key still didn&rsquo;t think it was his fault that things went spectacularly awry with Lee and also they agreed never to mention the events of the <i>Lee Episode</i> in public <i>or</i> private).<br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br />//<br />next chapter is mainly 2PM and U-kiss<br />not beta&#39;d. anyone interested?"

In this case it was the cool, sterile scent of a lab that always sent shivers down the back of his neck. There was the stale and metallic scent that reminded him of sterilized and carefully sharpen needles. He didn&rsquo;t have to open his eyes to know he was in a hospital, but he did so anyway, blinking a few times before the light wasn&rsquo;t so blinding.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It took more time for sound to come back, to hear something other than the high-pitched resonance that echoed in his head. In faded the humming and beeping of the computerized hospital equipment. <i>There</i> was the bussing of the small radio on the night table and then the rustling of the sheets as he started to get up. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He grunted when a sharp pain shot up from his leg; bit his lip and groaned louder. He wasn&rsquo;t bleeding, not yet, not anymore, he guessed and swept his tongue across his lips and the inside of his mouth. Iron. And morning breath. He couldn&rsquo;t decide which was worse.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He shifted around, trying to find a more comfortable position to sit in, but gave up after a while. His legs throbbed, his body ached, and his head was killing him. There was not much he could do to ease the pain except to stay very still, something he had never been particularly good at off the clock.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&rsquo;uck &lsquo;appened?&rdquo; His voice came out as a croak and he groaned. <i>Great.</i></span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He tried to remember what had happened, but his mind blurred which was unusual. He couldn&rsquo;t grasp the whole event, only small pieces here and there.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He remembered the bang. It had been loud and made his ears ring. There had been smoke, think and suffocating, and then the fire. He had tried to get out, to safety, but then the ground shook and he lost his balance. He remembered tripping, falling and trying to get back up. Something had hit him hard across the face and then everything went black.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&hellip;check&hellip;lab&hellip;.surv&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;wait&hellip;.someone&hellip;.boy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></i></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There were voices after that. He hadn&rsquo;t known if they were male or female. At the time everything sounded like noise. Distant and far-off like static that lay in the peripheral of comprehension. His body was paralyzed, his mind was swarming. He was somewhere between unconscious and fully conscious. Unaware yet had a small, fleeting notion of what was happening. He knew something had latched onto him and then he was off the ground and moving. To where or for how long he did not know and could not stay aware long enough to find out.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Oh dear! Are you awake?&rdquo; The boy jumped, surprised then winced at the pain. He hadn&rsquo;t heard her come in. &ldquo;Oh, are you okay? Don&rsquo;t move dear.&rdquo; She said, shaking her head. He didn&rsquo;t and watched as she approached. She set her tray down on the night table and reached for the phone that hung on the wall above the night table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just call the doctor and tell her you&rsquo;re awake&rdquo; She winked. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yes, doctor? He&rsquo;s awake&hellip;.Now I think, I&rsquo;ve only just come in&hellip;okay&hellip;okay&hellip;Alright. I&rsquo;ll see you when you come up.&rdquo; She set the phone back in the receiver looked at him. She smiled sweetly. &ldquo;The doctor will be right up dear.&rdquo; She then turned her attention to the tray, but kept talking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve finally woken up. I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Noin will just be overjoyed to hear&hellip;&rdquo; She went on, but he had stopped listening.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Doctor</span></span></i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">... Something&mdash; recollection?&mdash;familiarity?&mdash;popped up into his mind. Ignoring the pain in his head, he tried to recall the memory. It was something he should&rsquo;ve known. Something important, but what? <i>What? </i></span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><i><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Doctor?...Doctor?

Where was the professor? Why wasn&rsquo;t he with him? He thought. Where had the professor been at the time of the bang? Had he made it out or had he still been in his lab?</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;G?&rdquo; His vision blurred. He couldn&rsquo;t have been. &ldquo;No&rdquo; He whispered. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said, louder this time. &ldquo;<i>Fuck</i> no. G.&rdquo; This couldn&rsquo;t have been happening. <i>It couldn&rsquo;t</i>. He didn&rsquo;t want it to. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The boy sank into the sheets, ignoring the protests from his body and buried his head in his hands. All he could think was <i>fuck</i> and <i>no </i>and <i>G</i>. He did not hear the nurse&rsquo;s concerned questions and barely registered the soothing hand on his shoulder. He did not notice the group of doctors and nurses that entered the room and crowded him. They checked his vitals, changed the needles and the IV drip to a fuller bag. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He should have taken note of the contents of the bag, or memorized the faces of the hospital employees like G had taught him to, but it took all his concentration to suppress the churning in his stomach. He tried to ignore the nausea that was creeping up on him. He sealed his mouth so he couldn&rsquo;t scream, or throw up or both and shut his eyes tighter so he couldn&rsquo;t cry. G would have been disappointed if he had cried, he thought. He shut himself in tighter and curled into a ball. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The ache of his body was nothing compared to this new one. This one ran deeper. It couldn&rsquo;t be soothed with ointment or bandaged like a cut could. It was overwhelming. The pain consumed him and broke him down much faster. It made him sick everywhere. He didn&rsquo;t know where it came from or how to make it stop, if it <i>could</i> have been stopped. He did know, however, that it would leave a scar. Hurt this bad always did.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">***</span></span></p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It smelled like sunshine the next time he awoke. Warm light covered him like an extra blanket. He kept his eyes closed this time and basked in the sunlight. There was a fragrance in the room that dulled the scent he had come to associate with hospitals. It was earthy, flowery and worked to relax him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was exhausted but didn&rsquo;t ache like before. The pain was duller but not completely gone. It was there, and he felt it every time his heart beat. It was so close, yet far away at the same time; somewhere on the edge of himself. It reached out to grab hold of him, to take control, but couldn&rsquo;t completely seize him and make him submit. Not like before.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The boy shifted into a more comfortable position, not liking the feel of the starchy sheets or the too firm bed. He was sore which helped to dull the ache of his body. Sweat matted his bangs to his forehead, but he did not feel hot nor was it stuffy in the room. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">A soft <i>thud</i> made him open his eyes. The wall was painted an orange-ish creamy color with framed landscapes he did not recognize. There was a large short rectangular dresser pushed up against the wall and a mirror hanging in the center. Vases filled with very colorful flowers sat on top of a lightly colored dresser and he smiled, almost laughed. The room was very bright and colorful, as if it were designed for a child. He couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he had felt like a child. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The boy turned to the other side and saw that there were more flowers on the night table. They smelled nice and he wondered who could have gotten him such nice looking flowers. It wasn&rsquo;t as if he had a long list of friends or anyone who really cared about him. Not anymore. But his memory was a little fuzzy. He couldn&rsquo;t really be sure.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">His eyes found a book. One of those thick picture-less books he hated to read. There was an elbow perched on top the book and he followed it, his mind not quite comprehending just what he was seeing. There was a hand, then a chin. Lips, nose, eyes. He breathed out a laugh because her eyes were dark blue and beautiful. They were staring at him and he stared at them. He zoomed out and saw that she was beautiful too. She had blue-black hair that fell on one side of her face and matched her eyes. Her lips were red and up-turned. If he was fully aware, he would have said she looked amused.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Her red lips moved and it took a few moments for him to understand what she had just said.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Hello. My name is Lucrezia Noin.&rdquo; She spoke slowly and carefully, as if she was talking to a child. He laughed again.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t croak, but his voice broke mid-word. She smiled and nodded.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Can you tell me your name?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">His name? He hadn&rsquo;t thought about that in what seemed like forever. What was it again? He frowned. He couldn&rsquo;t remember yet at the moment it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter. He smiled and said:</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Lucrezia Noin&rdquo; She frowned a little and shook her head. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s <i>my</i> name. What&rsquo;s <i>your</i> name?&rdquo; She tried again. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Lucrezia Noin&rdquo; He said again. This time less sure and also shook his head. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;No&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;No&rdquo; he shook his head and chanted &ldquo;no no no no no no no no&rdquo; He yawned and slipped deeper under his comforter. It wasn&rsquo;t long before he was asleep again.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Lucrezia Noin sighed. She leant down and soothed the boy&rsquo;s bangs. Sally had warned her about this, about overexerting him, yet she couldn&rsquo;t help it. He looked so cute lying there, like a little infant who had only now just learned how to walk and wanted to explore the world. His eyes had gone so big when he had seen her and his smile was so wide. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin took a cloth from the table and wiped the sweat off the boy&rsquo;s face. He looked so small and fragile; she couldn&rsquo;t believe he was twelve as Sally had calculated. He hadn&rsquo;t looked that old when she had found him either, but neither had the other boy, before they arrived at the base.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She sighed. The two boys had improved so much after they had gotten treatment. She had been worried when she had heard that this boy had caught a fever. He was the smaller of the two and the one who made her worry the most. Thankfully the fever had broken during the night. He was now only recovering. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Sally had given him something&mdash;Noin had forgotten the name of the drug&mdash;to calm him down and help him recover during treatment. Before the fever, he had been very upset. Trauma, Sally had explained, from the explosion. He needed something to help him recover and calm him down, but the drug Sally prescribed left him drained and childish. It was like he was only half there. It made her fear for his sanity, but Sally said he would be okay once the treatment was over. Noin could only hope. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She watched the boy sleep and smiled fondly. The drugs had calmed him down alright. She gazed at him one last time before packing up and leaving. It was almost time for her shift to start and Clark would be pissed if she was late again. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">***</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He sat up. The pain was growing weaker as he was getting stronger. He grunted when short bursts of ache shot through his stiff joints as he tried to relax them. He tested his legs and they too were feeling better. Stiff, but okay.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He exhaled and leaned back on the headboard. There was a familiar buzzing in the back of his head he hadn&rsquo;t heard in what felt like a long time. He concentrated on it, trying to make the noise clearer. It was louder now, louder than it had ever been before, but he didn&rsquo;t get much further because someone was approaching.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was an earthy sent that smelled familiar. It smelled like fresh cut flowers and blue skies, but also dirt and mud and leaves. Wilderness. It was like being a kid again, exploring the outdoors.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The smell intensified, but so did the buzzing. He was confused because never in his life had the two been associated. The buzzing always preceded a spicy metallic scent. Gunfire and the heat created when a bullet was fired. Salty sweat with something sweet and warm underneath, but he never dared approach to find out what. That was when <i>he </i>came. Another person. A boy. The same as him, yet completely different in more ways than one. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Could it have been <i>him</i>? Could the person approaching be <i>him</i>? </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">His stomach turned and all of a sudden he felt sick. He tried to fight off the nausea that came with the anxiety and anticipation.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The door clicked open and a lady stepped inside. She didn&rsquo;t see him at first, too preoccupied with something inside her bag. She entered and closed the door behind her before she saw him. She jumped, smiled and walked over to the chair by the night table. She was smiling at him and this felt all too familiar, like he had lived this particular scene before in his life and he was re-living it now, though different somehow.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; She said and he nodded. There wasn&rsquo;t much else to do. He looked at her and thought that she was beautiful. She had dark blue black hair that fell on one side of her face. They matched her eyes, which he had thought to be black on sight but turned into a dark blue on closer inspection. Her lips were red and bright. Bright like her smile and the floral top she wore. Bright like the room, which made him feel like a kid, and bight like the sunlight that filtered though the room. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It was morning, he thought absently. He could hear birds chirping close by. A twig snapped and a squirrel scampered down below.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He knew this woman. He stared at her as she rumpled through her bag.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something for you. I didn&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d be awake of not, but I had hoped so. Sally said not to but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. Hospital food doesn&rsquo;t taste that good&mdash;&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in here plenty of times to know that&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo; She pulled whatever it was out.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">It was a juice box. She detached the straw and put it through the hole at the top before handing it to him.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Here. This should make your throat feel a lot better. You weren&rsquo;t sounding good the last time.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He nodded, a little lost and took the drink. <i>The last time what?</i></span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He sipped it and smiled. It was apple. He drank slowly. His throat was hot and rough and dry. It hurt a little when it went down but the coolness of the liquid soothed him. It helped and he wondered how she knew it would. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You look better.&rdquo; She was talking again and he placed his attention back on her. &ldquo;I was getting worried for a while there. Sally said&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Who&mdash;?&rdquo; He croaked but stopped because he already knew who. A name popped into his head. &ldquo;Lucrezia Noin&rdquo; How he had known he couldn&rsquo;t remember. He only had a vague recollection of meeting her sometime in the past. How long in the past he didn&rsquo;t know. His memories were broken up into jigsaw pieces and scatter wildly about. Hide and seek he was good at; puzzles? Not so much.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She seemed to light up at the mention of her name.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;You remember?&rdquo; She sounded surprised, then relived and sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo; She had been in there many times. Sometimes he slept through her whole visit, but sometimes he woke up, always in the same childlike, drug-induced state. He had never remembered her name before and almost always drifted off before she could draw him into any sort of extended conversation.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She looked at him staring at her and smiled.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Now you know <i>my</i> name, but I don&rsquo;t have anything to call <i>you</i> by. Can you tell me your name?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">His name? That would be more difficult. It felt like a long time had passed since he had used it, since anyone had asked for it. He didn&rsquo;t remember right away and then it popped into his head like, hers had moments before. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He smiled; amused that he had almost forgotten his own name when <i>his</i> name was always on his mind, on the tip of his tongue. Staring at the woman, he wondered how he could have ever thought she was <i>him</i>. She seemed sweet and harmless enough. She had even given him a gift. He could easily give her his name.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Duo&rdquo; He squeaked, cleared his throat and tried again. &ldquo;Duo Maxwell.&rdquo; The words felt strange coming out. It felt strange to speak. His mouth was slack and unused. He swiped his tongue across his chapped lips. His mouth tasted like apple juice, old blood and saliva underneath. There was the powdery taste of crushed pills and, of course, morning breath.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He tried not thinking of the needles sticking out from his wrist or the urge to rip them out and run. He didn&rsquo;t think about the drip standing beside him or the hum of the hospital equipment in the room. Instead, he focused on the woman beside him. She was speaking and smiling and made him calmer.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&hellip;better sooner than expected. The whole team was all very worried about whether or not you two would make it when we brought you here but you seem okay now.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">What was she talking about? He thought. She wasn&rsquo;t making any sense.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;&rsquo;at&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; That seemed like a good place to start.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin paused and sighed. She knew this was coming. &ldquo;You were involved in an accident, an explosion of some kind, we&rsquo;re still not sure. We haven&rsquo;t figure out what caused it or how it happened. We&rsquo;ve been investigating for a while now but still nothing.&rdquo; She watched him and went on, &ldquo;We found the two of you in the building buried under some debris and badly injured. You were both taken here to get treated.&rdquo; </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo listened carefully, but she still wasn&rsquo;t making any sense. He remembered the explosion. He remembered running, falling and tripping. He remembered getting hit by something and then blacking out.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Two of us?&rdquo; He vaguely remembered another person there but not with him. <i>Two</i>. He felt sick again. <i>&lsquo;the two of you&rsquo;</i>.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yes. You and another boy. He was also badly hurt.&rdquo;&nbsp; The buzzing was back in his mind, stronger, faster, closer.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Is he&hellip;is he here?&rdquo; He his gaze went toward the ceiling. All of a sudden it was freezing and he shivered as a chill ran down his spine. The nausea was back and so was the anxiety. He anticipated her next words and also dreaded them, already knowing the answer.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Noin nodded, slowly, watching the changes in the boy lying beside her. The sheets bunched up around his clenched fists and he was glaring at the ceiling. Something odd had come over him. She didn&rsquo;t know what.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">She lay her a hand over his. He winced, glanced at her and tried to throw her hand off, but she clamped down on it. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; she was getting worried. &ldquo;Should I call a nurse up?&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo; He asked again. He needed to hear her say it. The nausea only intensified the longer he waited. The buzzing got louder and louder. He barely heard her say:</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s here. In the room across the hall.&rdquo;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">The room across the hall. Across the hall. <i>Across the Hall</i>. <i>Right there</i>. Duo had to see him; had to see if he was still alive.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">Duo didn&rsquo;t hear Noin as he got up from the bed. He ignored the pain and the throbbing of his legs as he tried to stand up. He swayed, his legs not yet accustomed to his weight after lying down for so long. Something held him back, wrapped around his shoulders and pulled him closer to it. He kicked and screamed and pushed until they loosened then dashed to the door. The room was small and it wasn&rsquo;t a long way to the door. It opened easily and there it was. <i>The room across the hall</i>. Where <i>he</i> was. He stared at the door. This couldn&rsquo;t have been real. </span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He made his way across the short width of the hallway. Almost automatic, he opened the door. This couldn&rsquo;t have been real, he thought. He couldn&rsquo;t have&hellip;<i>he</i> couldn&rsquo;t have&hellip;where was the professor? Where was G? Where was J? Why was <i>he</i> here? When&hellip;when&hellip;</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">There was that glare. Those blue eyes stared back at him. His mind was swimming. He was falling and then he was lost in them. Gone. The anxiety was gone. The nausea floated away. The pain had faded. He had faded, until all that was left was blue. A cold crystal blue that seeped into his skin, through his joints and into his bones. It made his blood rush and chill at the same time. Blue clung to his throat making it impossible to speak or breathe or think. It swallowed him whole leaving nothing of himself behind. It was suffocating.</span></span></p><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was suffocating.</span></span></p><p style=""margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He was choking.</span></span></p><p style=""margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He needed to breathe.</span></span></p><p style=""margin-left: 1.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">He needed to scream.</span></span></p><p style=""margin-left: 2in; text-indent: 0.5in; ""><span style=""font-family:georgia,serif;""><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;"">And run before he completely lost himself.</span></span></p><p align=""center""><br /><a href=""http://my-midevilmind.livejournal.com/9974.html#cutid1"">1b - There</a></p></lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

And you all will be with white kids because you just cant seem to take the point of being around with other races becuase you guys are just to good for it lol..."

<TD>Ok, so you can attract a few people. But, don't get too cocky. I said a few! Not many people have erotic thoughts about you. Perhaps it's because you're too hard-to-get. Ya know, have high standards and live in a fantasy of everything being perfect and grand. Well, it's not that way, sweetie! Perhaps it's because you're too shy. Ya know, shy can be cute, but it can also be annoying. If you're always nervous and insecure, it's hard to see you as much else. Be bold! Be sexy! </TD></TR>

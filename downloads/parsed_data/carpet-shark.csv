"event","just some thought on the day....i advocate writting to all my inmates as a way to release feelings pent up inside. putting them down on paper is very theraputic and a usful tool for seeing what's inside your head and heart. but here i am, barely taking my own advice. i love to write and i would dearly love to put more here or somewhere. i don't mind ppl reading what i write as i don't really know them..ya know. but a few times my hubby looks over my shoulder and makes me self consious about what i'm typing. like just now he walks out here after having gone to bed an hour ago and asks me what i'm doing. i know he came because he heard the tippy tap of my hunt and peck style of typing. altho even if i were the greatest typer ever there would be that certain sound made when doing so. so back to what i was saying..i know he thought i was out here chatting to some great unknown to him person. this person would of course be someone other then himself that i was sharing my feelings and inner most thought with and not him. i HAVE done that before...not cheating in a physical sense but in a interpersonal way...sharing my thoughts and unhappiness with a stranger...perhaps i need a stranger to talk to. isn't it easier to express what you 'really' feel with someone who has NO emotional attachment to you? someone who listens and perhaps offers ideas but is non confrontational nor hurt by the things you say? i have gone to see psychologists before and it has all turned out bad. working where i do and with those in the field..it makes it hard to find someone NOT affiliated with my job in some fashion. so finding a qualified therapist who i feel comfortable with is so damn hard! so here i sit late at night when i shpould be sleeping, with the stiffness of my fingers aching and my back spasming wanting to share with another being (human is not important).

but what would i say? really? would i be totally honest? i don't think so at this point...i'm not honest with myself very often. the delusion i live under keeps the real world from interfearing and upsetting this delicate balance i've created in my mind that gets me throught each day. i need to go to work every day. i need to spend time with my family and animals and those that depend on me. i need to BE here for them.         .............i WANT to do my own thing, be that sleeping all day, reading my book, playing my games. being totally selfish in such a complete way that no other person or thing is involved at all! just me. what I want. what I need. what I hear. what I feel.  hhmmmm sounds delightful :)

only in my dreams...and not really even there for i dream of always 'doing' things and they pile upon me crushing me with their weight and supposed importance. this is my life...others are what i do...who i am....isn't it?"

"event","went to work today...and yesterday...so now i'm sitting here tring to stay awake untill bedtime. i was gonna go lay down for an hour but hubby made it clear he wasn't happy with that idea so here i am. to tired to play my game, which by the way i GM'd smithy today! yea for me!! now i just have to figure out how to get from 100 to 120..ha.
  i feel in a fog, sleepy and slow. i hate feeling this way, but what am i supposed to do? i just can't say, ""self, you are NOT sleepy. You are fine."" huh if only it worked that well.
  I wish i knew how to type better...oh dear. even this is making me even more tired. i had hoped that writing would help me stay awake. pooh. gotta find something else to do. maybe i'll eat. kinda hungry."

"event","now that i'm feeling better, i have to rejoin the real world and head back to work. it really rips me tho that no one even called to see if i was alive or anything! it burns me 'cuz if it was anyone else they'd sent flowers and cards and shown up to do housework and shit! those bastards sucked the life right out of me and don't even have the decency to show me any kind of support for my mental or physical wellbeing. well, fuck 'em and feed 'em fish!!

the really hard part is just getting back into the swing of things. i sohate being out of it and then having to pick it up where life dropped you in the shitter and move on. it's like standing in line with a few items at the store and then realizing you forgot something waaaayyy at the back so you can't just say 'hold on' you have to completely step out of line, run all the way to the item, and then find another line to get in, as if you had never been there in the first place.

at least it is my friday. which means i only have to get thru those 8 horrible hours, but it also means that i missed 4 days or 32 hours of work and i don't know if i have the time to cover it. of course my hubby thinks i don't, but i really think i might cuz i've worked a few holidays of late and that puts 8 hours on the books every time i work one. so i guess i won't know untill i call personell to ask. altho we have a new specialist who knows nothing about how to track out time and pay us correctly. altho cdc hasn't done it right since i started with the bastards 6 years ago!

ok ok ok. off to bed, and a wee bit of shut eye. nighty night"

"event","haven't passed on to the light yet. Damn! I think I've become anemic and started taking iron suppliments. I feel better today then I have all week!
amazing what a few pills and some seriouse stressless days can accoplish. not that they were completely stress free as i do feel guilty for not being at work. and i feel guilty for not getting things done around the house. and i feel guilty for just about everything that goes on around me!!
 anyhoo i am feeling somewhat better today. and i think i shall return to the world of the living tomarrow."

"event","when i feel icky i saty home. i lounge in my jammies and play on the puter or watch tv and nap. i love to read too. i feel icky today..little visiter hitting hard! when it decides to really show up it hurts my whole body. i feel dirty and no matter how much i may wash or change clothes i still feel unclean. i want to wash my hair and brush my teeth and scrub my body over and over and over till i don'y feel this way anymore. i know it's in my head...mostly, but it's uncomfortable to feel this way. it's like 4:30 in the afternoon and i've only been up for a few hours. i should have gone to work today, but i would have spent the whole eight hours in the bathroom, so no work gets done from in their. i know the time off hurts me and makes me look bad, which adds to my feelings of anxiety and depression. perhaps here i'll write what i really think/feel and others cam read it and see what a crazy person i've become in my old age1 the eally funny thing is that this is what i do for a living. my job is careing for the mantally insane. the irony is not lost on me. i enjoy the inside joke of it all. my husband doesn't understand my illness or feelings of guilt and inadequacy i feel over most things i do. i used to be more outgoing and self assured. happy even. but of late it isn't to be i guess. we are to move soon that is if any other place will take me with my sick records...i've called in sick a lot! mostly cuz i'm sick a lot, but also cuz i hate where i'm working! they suck suck suck suck!!!!!

i've decided to give in to the urge to shower and scrub my whole self from head to toe and back again...ya know how it says to wash rinse and repeat on the shampoo? i do that! really..can't help myself. i'm off to bathe and i'll be back clean and smelling good and soft and pink from head to toe!"

"event","Well americans have been down over a week and are going back thursday I have really conected to one - two people.

But I am writing in here to say a story some one told me. I was having trouble listening to gods call and he said perhaps I am looking to hard or perhaps it is in front of me so simple I don't know it (or some thing like that).

There was a man and he was on the roof of a building and the place was flooding and a boat came and said ""come on get in the boat it isn't safe here the place is flooding"". The man said ""no god will save me"".

So a bit later one the water has risen and it was up to the roof now. The boat comes along again and says ""Now come on mate get in the boat this is silly"" the man said ""No god will save me"".

So now the water has risen even more and is up to his neck. This time a helicopter came and said ""come on now mate this is ridicilous get in"" the man said ""No god will save me"".

The water finnaly rised and the man drowned. 

When the man got to heaven he said to god ""lord why didn't you save me"" God said ""I sent 2 boats and a helicopter"".

The morale of the story is that when you are looking for some sign that god is trying to talk to you or you are looking for a reply then perhaps it is simpler then you thought it can be the most obvious thing."

I havent wrote in here in awhile and the main reason is was lazy and I forgot. But today Im bored nothing to do sorta down so I thought I would put some of the stuff that seems to happen.

Well first of all I had a ok x-mas I hope every one did to and thast about it been playing Land Warrior online mostly and thats about it I enrolled back in college today for same course because I failed it last time and I guess that is it.

I dont no if god wants me to say anything but from my experience dont turn your back on him he is so easy to forget about but I try to remember to pray every night. If I had more trust in god adn fully relied on him I no my life would be alot happier then it is right now. I have faith lots of it but I have trouble being a good christian and I guess I am saying this because I want people to know if you are having trouble there are always christians to talk to on christian chat rooms forums etc. a very good one that is still growing is http://www.thechristianforum.org/ please check it out help it grow and learna nd get help even help people.

"event","Hey all well today I woke up at about 1:40pm something like that and um..... thats really it I watched alot of tv but good news is last night I finnaly finished my christian forum http://www.teenchristianforum.tk/ right now I am the only member but please signup and ask questions.

You might think what I have written in my journal so far is a laugh but it isnt really I talk to God most days and today I sinned a few times I think and I always ask him to forgive me.

Some timed I do stupid things when I no I am doing them and I think I shouldnt be doing this because it is bad but I put God to the back of my head and I feel dumb because I no I was doing it but I no I have to stop doing that but the thing is I no I should but I dont so for now on from this moment I am going to do my best not to.

If you think no one loves you God does he thinks you brilliant he thinks your the best you can never let him down so much that he wont love you because his love for you is eternal.

I hope my forum takes off I want to have a community of people who I can talk to and help and they can help other people. I am full of advice and I would gladly like to talk to any one.

I no I am going to keep writing about god and some times I may repeat myself but that is only because he wants me to say these things. I no what I have to do for God he wants me to spread his word whether online or off.

This is what God wants me to do for now and some times I think because I am so bad and I dont think God would be happy because I am not doing his work but at the end of everything that has happend to me and only now as I am writing this I realised that he has got me spreading his word!.

See out of everything that has happend to me with my x-fiance etc. up to now he planned this for me because at the end of it all he new I would understand and I would do what he wanted but I didnt even no I was doing it.

The great thing about God is what ever he does for you at the end you will always realise that he done it for a good reason and you will look back and see that yes it migt have been ahrd or something like that but at the end God came through and made your life that little bit better or he amde you a littlebit better either way he has helped you and trust me it makes you feel great knowing that you have been used for a great thing! it makes me happy knowing he ahs used me and it is even better knowing that he loves me and I love him.

God is mearly using me to type this he is putting the words in me.

We are Gods hands, feet, mouth and ears think about that we are part of god and we are doing what he wants.

Well god bless all!

I will write probably tommorow or during the week next =)"

After the cafe I came home and came online and well thats it I went shopping with my dad and then he dropped me off home where I watched dvds.

Today I came here and I decided to make the website for the christian forum I am still trying to design the logo I want but I am sure I will get there.

I also need a forum design but I am sure I will find one.

As far as I wanna talka bout God I no he wants me to say soemthing but I dont no what.

The fact is he loves every one so much I mean  you can sin as much as you want but at the end of every day he is there and if you as him to forgive you he will.

Your parents pnish you ground you etc. but God says it is ok and he gives you another chance.

I no my actions might not have been the best lately but I no God will make me make things right.

My lying has not become so bad it has gotten better God is making me be more carful about the things I say so if I say a lie now then I will automatically correct it or if i dont remember it or ntice it till it is to I ask God to forgive me for it.

Well thats all from me.

God Bless

Insid eme he made me feel warm for when i was doing good adn right adnd was being honest but when I wrote something that i might have thought was true but wasnt then he  would make it go cold and I am srelived that he is here for me because no one can no how much he means to me and how much I need him!

"event","hey all well I am writing in here early today I am not gonna talk about my day I might write it in later on.

I was going through my bible and I found some old paragraphs from when I used to be getting bullied.

When I got bullied it wasnt nice I really hated it then who does like it.

I was in year 9 or 10m pretty sure 9 when I was getting bullied nad it hurt so bad I was so scared to get out of the house I couldnt even go to the salvation army or my local church with out being scared.

Pretty much a few months into the bullying I think it was I came to christ I prayed and I received him into my life and as ahrd as it was getting bullied I always had  a relief when I had some one to talk to and that person was God I could talk to him be upset and one day on a Sunday I sat on my bed and I asked him for help and I went throught he bible I think I aske dhim to show me through ti adn stop me some where that could help me. I stopped on Psalm 59 and 61 and a few more paragraphs on that page helped to there were some more but after I realised he could protect me I started praying to him and he did help me it wasnt a instant thing but it got better now I dont get bullied and I couldnt even go to my favourite place to hang out because it was so bad.

Well the fact is God helped me and he answered my prayers.

Some times it seems he isnt answering them but he is it just takes time.

A friend told me today he was talking ot some one cant remember who but this person is very high in teh catholic church any way he said that ""out of the 6 billion people in the world on you can do Gods work no one else can do your job but you"" whether it is a stepping stone for some one else you are still doing Gods work. 

Think you could be helping people with your effort it might not seem like it at first but if you make that stepping stone for some one else imagine how many people they could help but if you didnt do Gods work then that stepping stone would be missing and that person couldnt complete the task.

Well I want to right more and it should be about something but I dont no what.

In this world I want to be happy and sin free but we all sin and you have to remember God forgives and I no that he is the ultimate person he will be there for you and he is the only one who can really help you in life! remember money or possesion of worldy goods is nothing because they stay behind when you are in heaven!.

I will write more about ym day later on but I really needed to write this God is using me alot ercfently and all I can assume it is something big later I will tell you where god has made a difference! I will write it ehre with reports but soon I might make a site for all my information and experiences on God!"

"event","Hey all *yawns* yet another day I been bored today well since I got home from college.

I have had a ok day in college 1 person wasnt in and apart form that I done everything i was set out to do for the day.

I got home after college sat down on here I tryed to get some sleep I really need it but I couldnt so I was on here for a bit and then I went up me sisters place with my dad we talked about how much my mum is bothering with her new boy friend and how she is neglecting every one else and how she si showing her true colours she used to have my neices down but she dont want them now she has a boy friend she lied to me to get me to baby sit so she could go out.

If she asked me I would have sauid yes any way but she lied so that made it worse.

I been lying for years not to every one but most of the people I no and I need to stop but iI cant so I am thinking of seeking professional help.

Well after that came home came on here and thats about it.

I have this urge to talk about God but I dont now ut to type up Im mean God RULES! and I cant explain my love for him he is so great he has helped me so much and I am so excited that he is always there for me I love talking to him I no that it seems weird that some times I talk to myself but at the end of it all I no God is listening to me and if I need some one to talk to about anything I have God and the best thing about talking to him is he can help what ever your problem is!!

The one person at the end of every day I can trust is God mean think about it day or night he is there for you!. You can talk to him cry to him and if you are honest with him and tell him how you feel about him good or bad he likes the honesty!

Some times it seems a struggle but at the end of it all I no God is there and it makes sense everything that happens makes sense.

Like i said before when bad things were happening to me I thought God wasnt there but he was I was concentrating on the bad things and I didnt see the bigger picture!

I was looking at a 2D view just the facts nothing else but recently I noticed that there was more to it then meets the eye and I saw Gods work in a 3D view and I saw the whole picture.

Well thats it for my entry I will see you all soon and please consider having God in your life it really does make your life a whole lot better!.

Remember faith is in the heart  and thats where God is he wil touch it if you want him to you just need to ask him into your life!

He has made such a difference in mine and I no I couldnt live with out him.

Well thast my entry I am stopping here unless God wants me to write more!

Take care all and God Bless!!"

"event","Hey well today out of 5 and a half hours in college I done no work because the lecturer wouldnt help me or my friend! then we got till tommorow to finish it off and mine aint done but I intend to report the teacher tommorow my friend is going to stay home.

After all of college I cam onilne I seen leish a friend of my xfiancy and she told me what marie was like how she always acts the victim! and how she is always after guys or girls! she even said to her that her baby had a miscarriage but marie had her baby so she lied again and well in a way it made me feel so good that I new what she was like and after everything I dont have to feel bad about what she said like she said I hurt her etc. because I no she lied and hurt me more and more all the time! and she made her self the victim and turned people against me well atleast now I no I did nothing wrong and well it takes a load off my mind and concious.

God made her a learning experience one which I wont forget I did not know or even think it was a lesson from God untill some one said to me about it over the holidays and it made me see I am not looking at what God is doing for me I am just looking at what is in front of me God does things and I dont see them because I am looking at it from a 2d view what I see is what I Get but in order to see what God is doing you need to look at it 3d.

God is some times hard to beleive in because you cant see him but you cant live with out him. but you breathe air you cant see it but you need it to live thats what god is we need him.

God is here to protect us from the devil and hell but God only offers a way to have happiness it is up to you whether or not you accept him.

If God doesnt exist and there is nothing after death would you prefer to beleive in God any way and make sure you are not going to hell or dont beleive in him and go to hell for eternal pain! To be on the safe side I would beleive in God! he is the only one who can protect us.

God kicked Lucifer out of heaven because he wanted to be more powerfuller then God and he didnt like what God wanted for him. So God created hell a place for Lucifer so people could choose the path they went on.

God is powerfuller then the Lucifer. God created Lucifer and God is powerfuller then the people he created.

If you want to no more about God anything at all please go to http://www.thechristanforum.org/ it is a small community but the people there are abundant with information and will answer any of your questions. My username on the forum is bioggy.

It made me and esspecially when I failed the part I past the last time =(!. My mum was pissing me off about it which is nothing new she has gone a tottal bitch since she got back with her x b/f my sister is even pissed off by her.

Well day goes by I had a driving lesson it went ok apart from driving on the wrong side of the road and cutting corners. My mind wasn't with it today I didn't really want to do a driving lesson today.

Well went to the cafe and talked to my mate Jonathon well boht of them there is Jonathon Mantle and Johnathon the IT guy they are both cool get on with them great. I left here at about 4'ish and posted some letters for Jonathonhe way to the bank to put a cheque in.

Well I got home came online played some roms snes ones they rule! Then my dad phoned and asked if I wanted to go shopping with him I said yes.

He came home picked me up and we went shopping came back home with the shopping and then came online.

Well when I got online I talked to ishy who rulez! and I talked to some one a pretty god friend I cant use her name with out her permission! but she told me something about some one which made me upset =( and I still am so I decided to talk to my bestest friend leonie about it but she just practicaly ignored me she said she was listening but I didn't think she was ='(.

Maybe some day I will have a good life with some one who I can love and who will love me but until then I treat g/f's with so much respect I would do anything for them well not all of them just the ones I really love like when I used to love Marie but now I am seeing some one else and I am not gonna say who it is now but I sis mention her name Anna in yesterdays entry ;).

Any way I am off now so I will write tommorow. Also after all this tie I still havent posted a poem but instead I am going to make a book of them when I get about 30 or something!"

Started reading my book again today it is out of the night world series. It reminds me of danielle a friend.

The Night World
Book number 4
Dark Angel
by  L.J. Smith

This book fills me with love in my heart every time i read it my heart just gives me a feeling one which i can't let go of. I suggest every one should read it. These books are brilliant and unique.

Toni's parents came over to see me i saved the day by climbing over the backyard wall and running to get a chineese. I saved Toni's ass. Basically my day in long paragraphs :D.

I am looking into visas even more and right now it has gotten alot more complicated but i am going to apply for one in september when i am 18 this is the only time i can apply for one because you have to be 18 and beable to work at normal standards like other people. I might find a company who will do all the paper work for me and i will work for that company out there that way i can have a new life a new start."

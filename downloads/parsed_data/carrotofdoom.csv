"event","i'm insane......i finally aired things out to the ex about things that happened. took so long to find the words...so now i'm a new bundle of confusion.

i go from not expecting to hear back from her to ""why hasn't she written back""....

i'd like for her to take my insane, yet purposeful ranting well.

yes i did plot to do my best to cause major chaos and humiliation in her life....but in the end i couldn't! i can't stop caring and i can't stop being her friend no matter how hard i try.

i guess i'm worried i didn't stress that enough. i didn't hve to tell her the ""master plan"", but as a friend I did.

it was hard, but she used to be someone...no, the one person i could tell anything.

now the more insane part is the fact i see her on msn messenger. i'm sure i'm not on her list cause we used to use AIM....but i know she's got the e-mail. 

maybe she's reading it now....maybe she's writing back...maybe she's striken speechless with a wave of long pent up emotion.

now that most of the anger is out and such, part of me wants to say hi....but i can't. i'm a ghost."

"event","well i did it. sent word to the ex, let everything out once and for all. told her of my ""master plan"" everything.

she diserved better than what i got. she might have had it coming. but i can't turn my back on her. and i was planning to do my best to cause enough turmoil that she couldn't possibly hide from what she did any longer.....

but fact of the matter, i still love her and miss my friend and everything else. and i'm incapable of bringing her any form of harm.

and turns out as i aired my grievances, that my anger and thirst for revenge. was me avoiding the feelings i still had. i still hurt over what was done. even though i'd moved on. but it seemed sensable to cause her pain to get ride of mine. let her have it back.

anger doesn't give you strength, even if you think you're channeling it in the right directions. it takes so much more strength to look back and remember the good things, knowing they might never be ever again, ever. it doesnt' have to hurt. it's sad. but letting anger cloud your vision only strips that much more away.

i guess that was my final lesson after all. 

also i could feel the weight lifting as i wrote and let thigns out. i'm still mad, still sore, but feel better. and now i feel lighter and it's really weird having more room inside. i had no idea how full of anger i'd let myself become.

but now having said my peice and really let somethings go...now it's kinda like losing her again. i'm not ""sad"" sad. but mopey. 

and i hope that maybe if she needed to that she'll feel better knowing that i still care and will always be there.

oh and just to note. really don't let anger fuel you. i am so sore, achey, and physically drained after everything finally coming to a head, you wouldn't believe."

"event","....i think i've lost my nerve.....the whole while i've been ranting and raving on my revenge toward the ex.....even more tactful approaches to letting the truth be known, a good one a bud suggested.....but the more i'm faced with making my stand, my final confrontation against the injustice vested upon me.....the more i can't see the ""enemy"".

by all accounts i don't owe her a damn thing after what she did....and she diserves her comeuppance! but i just am losing the nerve to do anything that could potentially hurt her.

and it drives me nuts! i watched my best friend do everything possible to avoid having to deal with me, and face what she did. perfering to ignore it, replace me lickety split.

it took like a week to get the new guy that was the right color, into the picture. how much of this haste was her trying to avoid thinking about what happened? she had major avoidance issues with anything difficult or unpleasant.

even though i was messed up. i made the honest effort to be just friends again.....she didn't. she got to where i'd barely get the time of day.

backstabbed, heartbroken, replaced like a roll of toilet paper. AND I'M STILL A LOYAL FRIEND? she doesn't deserve a friend like me!

might not be together, she might prefer to pretened i don't exist...but she's still my friend.

and as much as i want hate her..........she's not the enemy i want her to be. striking back with my glorious vengence, sounds fun. but i can't hurt her. and try as i might with all my anger, i don't hate her....i can't.

again i owe her nothing....but i still can't bring about actions that could destroy any feelings she has left......maybe it's foolhardy wishful thinking but i think some where deep down inside, some still remain. and even if there's no chance of them getting back out, and there most likely isn't. i can't destroy it.

whether she's still my friend or not. i'm still hers.

and i think maybe my final confrontation and stand, isn't reaping glorious revenge. but confronting her and making my stand against her. tell her how i deserved better. tell it all like it is.

then whatever may come, let that decide my next course of action. i reckon i do owe an old friend one final chance. whether they diserve it or not.

funny, i would like to know if over the ages i've ever crossed her mind.....but i'm terrified to find out if the answer is ""no"".

it's one thing to be cast out.....it's another to entirely be forgotten."

"event","*sigh* it's really eating me up inside being so close to my ""masters"" dream coming to fruition that it's hard to contain myself.

I've found his ""target"". I must say it was a lot easier to do than I had anticipated.....why i didn't think of checking a couple of places a long time ago is beyond me.

so now i am making myself at home in those places, i reckon that means here too. 

i still don't understand the master's hesitance to put his plan into motion. it's not really like he owes this person anything after what happened to him. he doesn't deny that some measure of fault might be his in the matter. but what happened still shouldn't have happened. just ain't right. 

i try to convence him that he shouldn't feel guilty for doing what he has to to finally be rid of the chains that bind him, and set things straight. but he's got one mean streak of loyalty.

guess that just goes to show something for his character, that despite the anger and bitterness of having a friend totally destroy you, that he can still bear them no ill will.

how freakin' ""Kill Bill"" is that? It's totally like that, only no killing or anything. You've got ""B""(for those that may have yet to see it) she's freaking betrayed, shot, and left for dead. and despite all her rage, and quest for revenge she still loved Bill?

Just like my master more or less. 'cept his coma was a waking one. but he's awake now, and much as he hides it, he's damn pissed.

but he's giving the friend in question one chance(even though they may never know it)to stop him from spilling ALL the beans. And force them to confront some measure of what they've done."

"event","I'm back in Phoenix and across the country from Ian. He's completely stopped talking to me and part of me still hopes that he will realize how much I'm worth, but he clearly won't. He's been drunk almost every day since he's been back in new york. He's not looking for a job or trying to model or even working on getting in the school he wanted. He's taking money from his parents and living like the people I came to hate in New York. I was comforted that Lindsey was with him because she's smart and kind and interesting, but I don't think it's enough. No one holds him accountable. We haven't talked for a couple weeks and all I know is that they had this underwear party where ian looked really sick, but it was mostly because he was wearing eye-liner. I just don't get how he can just not care about me anymore. I'm trying to give up, but I really do love him and care about him. I've been seeing someone, but it's sort of a secret. It's all too complicated. 

I need to be on medication or something.

"event","With optimism and relief and after much thought, I am going back to Phoenix. Part of me feels really silly for moving here to begin with, but AIDS Walk has had a huge impact on my life and I'm super grateful. 

I am heading back because AIDS Walk is over, I have almost no friends, and Ian is a dead end. Most of his friends have no expectations of him and they are able to get along just fine with him. The ones who do have expectations find their phone calls being ignored. I am planning to fall in to the latter half. He's a great guy in a lot of ways. He's gorgeous, fun, adventurous, politically aware, and has a huge heart for the masses, just not for me. 

I also want to head back because RENT is going to be st the start of Nearly Naked's season. It's always been a dream and I would love to do the show with my friends. I miss having a community and being cast would certainly help my esteem. I don't need free time right now. 

I am going in to it knowing that a lot has changed. Natalie, Emily, and Ryan all live in other states. I don't have a best friend. Alex has a girlfriend. I am just going to do my best and try to work through this. 

Onward if not upward."

"event","I am so insanely insecure and it's not getting better with age. Ian was stopped on the street on saturday and asked to be a model. He's doing a show for FIT and being picked up by Boss Models. This is a pretty huge deal. If it were any other friend, I would be so happy. I would be jumping for joy. Since it's Ian, all I can think about is him abandoning me. This is a really bad sign. It's a mixture of self-hate and distrust. Ian is 20 and I'm 27 and I can't trust that he will stick around. I hate that I feel this way. It makes me feel like an awful friend.

We got in an awful fight on Saturday night after he tried to get me to dance with a guy who we were both attracted to. I didn't want to deal with drama, but it happened anyway.

I need to get back to doing theatre soooooo badly. I really hope I can do something once AIDS Walk is done. I need to do something with Tom or John. I would love to work on some original plays. 

On the up side, I got hit on a lot this weekend. I gave a guy my number and thought he was semi-cute and then he added me on facebook and found out that he's 19. =/ haha. LAME!"

"event","Ian is insane. He is dead set on changing the way he's been living and part of that involves him asking me if he can move back in with me. What? Was he not there the first time? I don't know if he knows what he's asking me. Part of me wants him to move in because I would save 325/month and I would worry a lot less about him. I'm currently not interested in dating anyone because I don't think that I should be in my current mind set. He says the same thing. Maybe it would be different than before because he's gotten it out of his system. I don't know. 

I am going to dinner with his parents when they get here. They love me and I love them. 

Here's the deal: if I let him move back in, I will probably move back to AZ right when the lease is up. I'm feeling much healthier mentally since starting to see my therapist, but I can continue that work in AZ where people are friendlier and more genuine.

I blamed a lot of my problems and unhappiness on being selfless and not thinking about myself enough. Over the last year and a half I have tried to be selfish in order to make myself happy. It turns out that the problem is that ""happiness"" is always temporary. Theatre makes me happy. My friends make me happy. Why do I think that I need a guy to make me happy? What was it that I mis-learned in my childhood which lead me to think that I was half of a person? And what would make me think that I could find what's missing in another person when other people are just as lost as I am. I spent years trying to find it in alex and if I dont change it, I will spend years trying to find it in ian.

I was thinking about my relationship with alex and how good it was to get past the part where I'm controling and possessive because then I could focus on me and do theatre because I had someone there who I could trust. I say that now, but I don't know if I ever really trusted him since he wouldn't be my boyfriend or even admit that he had feelings for me. He used to tell me that he liked me as a friend and he was sexually attracted to me, but had no romantic feelings for me. 

Ian wants to spend at least 4 days a week with me, but doesn't want to be with me. That's hard for me to understand. What does he think will happen when either of us date someone?

It's ian's birthday this week and I bought him a present. I feel like a total chump buying him something when I can tell he is just over his friendship with me. He has Mitch here and doesnt need me to hang out with him unless mitch doesnt want to. we went to a bar last night and he got pissed off at me and wouldnt tell me why. I'm sure it has something to do with me getting hit on by multiple guys. He didn't talk to me the rest of the night and made out with some super drunk guy. It made me a little sad, but I am mostly trying not to care. I feel like he came to new york to get laid, get drunk, and do coke. That's not the person I thought I was moving here with. 

I got him an interview with the company I work for, but a different store. I also charged his phone and took it to him tonight(I was in union square anyway). He got out of work and didnt even call to see if I wanted to do anything. He just went over to mitch's. He clearly doesnt care about me anymore. 

it makes me upset because I wish that I didn't care about him at all. I know that I shouldn't, but I have always been that type of friend that forgives way too often. Emily got a dui in my car and I forgave her. Matt Gilbert put me through hell. Now I have Ian to take advantage of me and hurt me. 

I won't lie. Sometimes things are good and we get along like we did before we were ever together, but those times are getting to be fewer and fewer and I'm not sure they're worth the hurt.

I tried to be what he thought was attractive and acted in a way that I thought would make him like me. None of it worked. It was completely futile. 

On top of that, I have an insanely low self-esteem and self-image. I spent years having sex with this person because I wanted that attention from him even if it wasn't exactly what I wanted. As you can imagine, this only made my self-esteem lower. It made me feel ugly and unworthy. It made me feel like there was absolutely nothing that I could do to be loveable. I spent the entire time trying to find someone who could make me feel safe and secure. I still can't find that because I always look outside of myself.

I bring this up because I am refusing to let history repeat itself. I deserve to be loved on my terms. I deserve more than just table scraps of affection. I can't spend any more time and energy and love and affection on someone who thinks they can do better than me.

I want to say that there's no way it can ever happen again. I want to say ""I am better than this. I deserve better. You're not worth waiting for.""

You and I had drifted apart and he was there to take over as if someone sent him.then you started to feel. You started to miss me and dread losing me to him. You and I were never anything but our names. No title. And suddenly you wanted so much more than I could give you. And I was neck deep into his life. 

I wanted to want you again. I wanted to give up on him and just pour my love in to you. I wanted it to be complete. And everyone would have been so happy for us for finally getting it right. It would have been a dream come true.

I have so many friends that I know will understand this. People who imagine and dream. I have a few that won't.

"event","made out with someone that I wanted to tonight. that's always fun. this guy was a funny choice of make out, but I don't think I can go in to that here.  

on a completely different note, I may buy a prius. I need to save some more money, but then I'll be able to have a payment pretty close to what I have and I can spend less on gas. it's nice to dream. we'll see.

sleeeep."

But when I come home on a sunday night and alex isn't here and it's dark and quiet, I just wish there was someone here to snuggle up on the couch and watch the simpsons and kiss and eat dinner. Someone to share all of this with. I can never seem to find it in myself and I'm sick of trying to find someone else who really wants to be there. Where will this guy come from? Do I already know him? When is someone going to surprise me?"

"event","the show is going soooooo well. we are starting to sell out every show, so they are thinking about adding 3 more shows. I love it so much. If I ever do have a boyfriend, they may just hate me for never being able to love them as much as performing. haha. not a bad thing to admit. 

Laura and Ashley- I hope you can make it, because tonight I was imagining you watching it and loving it.

Jen- I hope that you'll come to see the play mostly so we can see each other grown up and with nice teeth. And you should bring Michal with you. she'd like it too.

Justin & Randy- I hope you can make it too. Daniel and Ian are going to try. It would really mean a lot to me.

that's all. I hope...I hope...I hope.

I'm currently obsessed with this guy. I'm thinking of working with Natalie and Alex on a play about this theory. It would be about the social and emotional affects of living for 1000 years or more. Pretty insane and amazing stuff."

"event","I am so intensly tired as of late and it's because I stay up too late and have have to wake up too early. I have been dead tired at work and I still don't go to be on time, 

BUT

I got to go back to another weekend of doing the show and it's so amazing. When I'm really tired, I sometimes forget how incredibly lucky I am. I get bogged down and can't see past a small problem. This play is probably one of my top 3 favorite plays to be in. I also love watching it from off stage. I had about 12 people at the show tonight. They all totally got it. What an amazing life I lead. 

I really hope that everyone gets to lead a fulfilling and productive life. I can't imagine being like so many people that I work with and just going through the day to day. Find something to inspire and motivate you or else, what's the point? Why are you alive? To get drunk and fuck and survive? what a waste! I don't even want people like that around me. It's too easy for that type of life to seem like enough. 

come see it if you haven't. Not for me, but for the experience of seeing people create art in front of you. And because it's so insanely funny. : )"

"event","saw Of Montreal tonight. I went in to it expecting nothing and had the best time. danced like a maniac. saw some of my fave people.

I also saw Ethan. It was little weird seeing him because I just sent him a message today after months of not talking to him. He plans on coming to my play. he looked good and said we should hang out, but I am pretty over the whole thing. It still says straight on his profile, so that's not a good sign. I think that if you exchange fluids with men, you're gay. sorry.

and my mormon friend came out to me. I can say it here because no one knows him. He is still really upset about the whole thing. He's so sweet and likeable. I just don't think that I could date someone who is in the closet still. Plus people would suspect because I don't hide anything. haha.

life is pretty good right now. not going to lie."

"event","I have had a long and stupid history of liking guys that are completely selfish and self absorbed. Why would I like anyone who only cares about their own well being and doesn't wory about whether sometime might make me feel bad or disapoint me?

well I have to change that. I can't expect someone else to change for me when they don't care about other people to begin with. I am the only one that can make that change. I won't accept that from friends or guys that I am dating. i can only take so much before I'm hurting myself.

If I am wrong, then I suppose they'll have to prove it and make a real effort because I'm done trying hard enough for everyone. 

seeing cabaret tonight with a very sweet and caring group of friends. should be great. more updates later."

"event","1) the show opened and it went really well. Stray Cat is still the best theatre in az to me. 

2) barely got to see natalie tonight at Holgas. always nice.

3) Ate a hooters and had someone texting me all night who was not in my phone. I thought it was one of my friends messing with me or a guy who I hadn't talked to in a long time. It turned out to be the deck manager for the show. awk.

4) found out that Todd who did the props for the show is a piano badass which made me somewhat attracted to him even though he has a mommy body, but then Kim asked if he had a boyfriend and he said, ""No, actually I'm straight."" She also found out that he's mormon. I didn't like him or anything, so I wasn't sad, but I was uterly shocked. When you are a great piano player and you do musical directing for shows, it doesn't always mean you're gay, but it usually does. And this guy is a nancy boy. Gayer than gay. Closeted theatre people blow my mind. Evem when they're mormon. so weird to me.

5) Seth sent me a text to wish me luck on the show. I'm an idiot. he's so sweet.

6) I'm tired as fuck and happy that I am done with rehearsals and can go back to having nights to sit at my house. sleeeeeeeeep."

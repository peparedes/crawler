kicking it,

"event","There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want 
to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! 

When the door of happiness closes, another opens; but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the
one, which has been opened for us. 

Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.  Go for someone who makes you smile,
because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. 

May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you 
strong, enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy. 
The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along
their way. 

When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so at the end, you're the one who is
smiling and everyone around you is crying. 

Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take; but by the moments 
that take our breath away!"

"event","There once was a little girl who had a bad temper. Her mother gave her a
bag of nails and told her that every time she lost her temper, she must
hammer a nail into the back of the fence.

The first day the girl had driven 37 nails into the fence.  Over the next
few 
weeks, as she learned to control her anger, the number of nails hammered 
daily gradually dwindled down. She discovered it was easier to hold her 
temper than to drive those nails into the fence.

Finally the day came when the girl didn't lose her temper at all.  She told 
her mother about it and the mother suggested that the girl now pull out one 
nail for each day that she was able to hold her temper. The days passed 
and the young girl was finally able to tell her mother that all the nails
were 
gone. The mother took her daughter by the hand and led her to the fence.
She said, ""You have done well, my daughter, but look at the holes in the
fence.  The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, 
they leave a scar just like this one.  You can put a knife in a person and 
draw it out.  It won' t matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound 
is still there.  A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one.


To all of my friends out there, Please forgive me if I have ever left a hole in your fence."

"event","I sat in my seat of the Boeing 767 waiting for everyone to hurry and
stow their carry-ons and grab a seat so we could start what I was sure to
be a long , uneventful flight home. With the huge capacity and slow moving
people taking their time to stuff luggage far too big for the overhead and
never paying much attention to holding up the growing line behind them, I
simply shook my head knowing that this flight was not starting out very
well.
I was anxious to get home to see my loved ones so I was focused on ""my""
issues and just felt like standing up and yelling for some of these clowns
to get their act together. I knew I couldn't say a word so I just thumbed
thru the ""Sky Mall"" magazine from the seat pocket in front of me. You know
it's really getting rough when you resort to the over priced, useless sky
mall crap to break the monotony. With everyone finally seated, we just sat
there with the cabin door open and no one in any hurry to get us going
although we were well past the scheduled take off time. No wonder the
airline industry is in trouble I told myself. Just then, the attendant came
on the intercom to inform us all that we were being delayed. The entire
plane let out a collective groan. She resumed speaking to say ""We
are holding the aircraft for some very special people who are on their way
to the plane and the delay shouldn't be more than 5 minutes. The word came
after waiting six times as long as we were promised that ""I"" was finally
going to be on my way home. Why the hoopla over ""these"" folks? I was
expecting some celebrity or sport figure to be the reason for the hold
up.........Just get their butts in a seat and lets hit the gas I thought.
The attendant came back on the speaker to announce in a loud and excited
voice that we were being joined by several U. S. Marines returning home
from Iraq!!! Just as they walked on board, the entire plane erupted into
applause.


The men were a bit taken by surprise by the 340 people cheering for
them as they searched for their seats. They were having their hands shook
and touched by almost everyone who was within an arm's distance of them as
they passed down the aisle. One elderly woman kissed the hand of one of the
Marines as he passed by her. The applause, whistles and cheering didn't
stop for a long time. When we were finally airborne, ""I"" was not the only
civilian checking his conscience as to the delays in ""me"" getting home,
finding my easy chair, a cold beverage and the remote in my hand.
These men had done for all of us and I had been complaining silently about
""me"" and ""my"" issues. I took for granted the everyday freedoms I enjoy and
the conveniences of the American way of life I took for granted others paid
the price for my ability to moan and complain about a few minutes delay to
""me"" those Heroes going home to their loved ones. I attempted to get my
selfish outlook back in order and minutes before we landed I suggested to
the attendant that she announce over the speaker a request for everyone to
remain in their seats until our hero's were allowed to gather their things
and be first off the plane.


The cheers and applause continued until the last Marine stepped off and
we all rose to go about our too often taken for granted everyday
freedoms......... I felt proud of them. I felt it an honor and a privilege
to be among the first to welcome them home and say Thank You for a job well
done. I vowed that I will never forget that flight nor the lesson learned.
I can't say it enough, THANK YOU to those Veterans and active servicemen
and women who may read this and a prayer for those who cannot because they
are no longer with us. GOD BLESS AMERICA! WELCOME HOME! AND THANKS FOR A JOB WELL DONE"

"event","EXCERPTS FROM A CAT'S DIARY:

Day number 180
My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. 
The only thing that keeps me going insane is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another house plant.

Day number 181
Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking. Almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair...must try this on their pillow.

Day number 182
Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in an attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was.
Hmmm.... Not working according to plan.

Day number 183
I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. 
This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called ""shampoo"".
What sick minds could invent such a liquid? 
My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth.

Day number 184
There was some sort of gathering of the humans.
I was placed in solitary confinement throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call ""beer"". More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of ""allergies."" Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.

Day number 185
I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. 
The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. 
The bird on the other hand has got to be an informant, and speaks with the humans regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal cage, his safety is assured. FOR NOW! 
But it is only a matter of time......."

"event","1. 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. 

2. In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger. 

3. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. 

4. One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a University of Washington study. 

5. Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. 

6. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.

7. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page.

8. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can 
slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer. 

And now for the properties of COKE: 

1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 

2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days.

3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and let the ""real thing"" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china.

4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a rumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.

5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 

6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes. 

7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy. 

8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add 
detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield. 

For Your Info: 

1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail 
in about 4 days. Phosphoric acid also leaches calcium from bones and is a major contributor to the rising increase in osteoporosis. 

2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous Material placards reserved for Highly corrosive materials. 

3. The distributors of Coke have been using it 
to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years! 

Now the question is, would you like a glass of water or a glass of coke???"

Today the world lost a great person and a dear friend of mine. News came to me from his wife, Mike was killed in combat fighting for what he whole heartedly believed in!  Mike was one of the most outspoken people I have ever met and wasn't afraid to let it be known that he was a very proud soldier...

I recall talking with him many time about his views on the upcoming war, and though he never expressed this to me personally....I do believe he had asked to get sent over. He was in charge of a SLRM and in charge of 3 other men....his job was to help give ground support to the infantry.

The best I can make of it thus far, he was hit with incoming artillery fire on March 23, 2003 and wasn't officially found until March 28, 2003.

Erica, we all feel your deep loss right now and just know....Mike is watching over you and your soon to be born son ....now and always!

"event","To nobody's surprise there were protesters today in DC, they attempted to 
disrupt the metro system and block the Key Bridge, a leading artery into DC 
from Northern Virginia. I got hosed twice because I come in from NoVA on 
the metro and it is raining hard which makes traffic worse any way. My commute was long and arduous and only caused further resentment for protesters (but that isn't the point of this thread). 
Anyway, I'll get to the point. 

I got off the train in Rosslyn because I had to use the bathroom and 
the train was moving quite slowly. When I was getting back on the 
train, there were protesters on the train platform handing out pamphlets 
on the evils of America. I politely declined to take one. An elderly 
woman was behind me getting off the escalator and a young (20ish) female 
protester offered her a pamphlet, which she politely declined. The young 
protester put her hand on the old woman's shoulder as a gesture of 
friendship and in a very soft voice said, ""Ma'am, don't you care about the 
children of Iraq?"" The old woman looked up at her and said, ""Honey, my first 
husband died in France during World War II so you could have the right to 
stand here and bad mouth your country. And if you touch me again, I'll stick 
this umbrella up your ass and open it."" 

I'm glad to report that loud applause broke out among the onlookers and the 
young protester was at a total loss for words."

"event","I keep telling myself that I won't post anything here in my journal about the war, yet I can't seem to help myself.

Today we found a hospital...comes as no suprize to me...that has weapons and munitions as well as 3,000 chemical suits and the antidote for nerve gas over in Iraq. Imagine what we WILL find once the fighting has stopped and we have real time and people searching. We already know Saddam has the weapons....they have been listed in the 12,000 page report for over 12 years now....he just couldn't or wouldn't show proof that he destroyed any of them..."

"event","I've been asked a very weird request from a few ladies I know. And for the life of me, I can't figure out why any woman would actually want to see a man in a Kilt.

I told them I would consider this, but they also needed to give me just 1 valid reason why a kilt. Needless to say, they both responded with many reasons, just none that could be considered valid.

I think the best so far has been that she loves to see a guy's naked knees, which is cool with me, but I certainly don't need to be in a kilt to show my knees. Another great reply was it just makes it a lot easier to ""peek"". Ah hell, if that is all that is wanted, I'd gladly just take my pants off.

Don't know what the fascination with a guy in a kilt is, but perhaps someday I will"

"event","It is disturbing to me to know there are people in this country who are so arrogant to believe we should not be in this war because of how some other country might precieve us.

Because somebody might see this as a first strike and think we are wrong or we are being bullies.

When in reality there are more countries who see the few people in this country who are against the American government and this administration as being anti American.

These other countries see the protestors in the streets. They see them obstructing traffic.(infringing on others personal rights)They see them destroying personal and public property. They see them throw things at law enforcement personal.

Do I need to remind you we are currently in a war with threats of terrorism and these same law enforcement personal are need to protect the citizens of this country. How arrogant of you to believe your right to do these things is more important than allowing the police to do their jobs.

Theres more to this war than just removing Saddam from power or eliminating the weapons of mass destruction. We will put a stop to the rape camps where 9 and 10 year old girls are used as payment for a good job to the Iraqi military. While your out there in the streets fighting for their right to pull a train on these young girls. Our soldiers are over their trying to stop them from doing it.

How about the mothers of small children who are shot in front of them to insure the next generation will be more compliant.

How about the small children who are taken away from their families with a promise to reunite them,to insure their parents will work harder so Saddam can afford to live in billion dollar mansions. 

I'm sick of hearing you complain because you have a right to complain or you are afraid of what someone might think of you if you try to stop these things from happening.

Your damn right I'm mad,so you can take your signs and stick them up your arrogant asses and kiss mine.

Don't try to justify those silly little wining noises you make by saying I support our troops (but).

If you want to support the troops,DO IT don't just say it."

"event","There are all sorts of ""reasons"" and ""goals"" that have been slung about for the war, and all sorts of denials by those who simply must grab a sign and parade in the streets to get their pictures on TV to show their opposition. 

Whenever you wonder why we are fighting this war, I suggest you go to this site: 

http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/03/02/08_gassing.html

Look at the picture of the Kurdish woman lying dead clutching her child. She and the baby were gassed by Saddam Hussein. Along with about 5000 of her fellow citizens of Halabja.

For the crime of being a Kurd.

Imagine, now, for a moment, yourself in her place, holding your child in your arms, aware that you both are dying a horribly painful death. 

No amount of appeasement, diplomacy, sanctions nor handslaps will erase the shameful guilt of that incident. If Saddam Hussein can do that to women and children with poison gas, do you think he would stop with just the Kurds if he had nuclear weapons? And he has been working very hard to get them. 

The irony is that all of those people with the ""give peace a chance"" signs should have been flashing them at Saddam. Doing it now, when we are trying to rid the world of such a monster only lends tacit approval to the acts he committed. It is as if they are saying ""OK, so he gassed a few Kurdish women and children, so what? Getting our pictures on TV matters more than that."" 

Incidentally, one might think that the site to which I refer you is a bastion of Conservative propaganda. It is not. It is actually a liberal site condemning the administration for not doing something about the Halabja incident. It is one of the few sites that still has pictures of the Halabja massacre. 

There will be a million reasons and justifications for the war. And a million more condemnations of it. When I hear them, I remember the image of the mother and her child, and wonder what it must have been like for her in that last instant of her life. And for THAT, I want to see Saddam Hussein and his political machine dead. And I cannot understand why anyone in this country would not want to hold that photo in front of his face while the last light of life went out of his villainous eyes.

To condemn or vilify the Bush administration for going after the perpetrator of that poisonous act is the same as justifying Saddam's murderous behavior. It is saying ""We don't care what the guy did, just leave him alone."" How can that be acceptable in this country? 

The only way for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. 

Such evil must never, ever, be allowed to triumph."

Football practice has started once again .....another year....more bullshit to deal with....didn't want Shane playing on the offense this season...but...unfortunatly...it does look like Jerry has plans to keep him as a running back.....gawd I hope not......he's 62 pounds of energy.....but playing in a 135 pound league......that's a lot of extra weight to be getting hit with almost every play.....at least on defense....he'll be doing the hitting....which I'm sure he'll be fine with as he proved that last year already......had no problems when we'd scrimmage the older team....."

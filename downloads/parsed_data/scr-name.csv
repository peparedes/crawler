"event","well today was supposed to be exciting but it was just like a regular day. see i was ready for someone to shoot or blow up my school, but no. i was also ready to go into the bathroom and not be able to see the other end for weed smoke, but yet again, no.

in fact nothing out of the ordinary happened today except the fact i was called ""a long haired skinhead"" by someone at my school. i diddnt know a such thing exsited.

ok thats enough on my boaring day"

grey's last night was amazing, after sitting there for quite a while, while everyone squeeed and screamed over the *really* hot sex and the dying-ness, have spent most of the time since theorising about next season after it's third season was finally confirmed last night, (although it is moving to a thursday, where there will be greater competition from CSI, but i think if the ratings really suck, they'll move it again, THEY CANNOT CANCEL GREYS)

have also been trying to discover the fate of all of our other much loved shows. spoilerfix.com, has a pretty up to date list of all the shows it covers, it's just waiting for the final updates tomorrow, although rumour has it, that supernatural has been picked up for 22 episodes (Robin did a very fun dance while making odd noises when she found out.), VM has been picked up for 22 (although could drop to 13 if ratings suck), GG is apparantley only up for 13, but this is to be revisited mid-season. there are more, but i can't remember...

Tom: so what letters do i press?
Me: you hold down ctrl, then A, C, and V.
Tom: okay, A....C...and what?
Me: *slaps forehead with palm* press v.
Tom: ok, got it, thanks
*puts down phone*
*phone rings again two minutes later*
Tom: Well, i did what you said...
Me: and...
Tom: Well, it took so long to copy that i forgot it again....
Me: *repeatedly hits head against wall* A....C....V
Tom: okay, let me just try, can you hang on a sec...
*ten minute wait while he tries to locate three damn keys on the keyboard*

and then the conversation continued in much the same way for at least another 15 minutes, with him phoning me a total of 6 times with in the half an hour period, at least my mum wont let him ring me like that again from turkey, too expensive...she goes in like 12 hours, and i will officially be living alone...crazy much. x."

in actual fact it possibly couldn't have gone worse. i hate partial pressure, i hate organic, i hate the whole bloody lot. anyway enough of that, i have too much revision to even think about.

last night was, well, interesting! firstly found a brilliant website, www.effingpot.com, it's a british guide for americans, and let's just say it's wrong, very wrong, and not just in the way that they have the wrong definitions of stuff, we apparantly have very dirty expressions that are used daily, i mean what do you really think 'keep your pecker up' means? as well as the millions of ways of describing sex and getting drunk, we are a very dirty county indeed.

this was soon followed by a large number of jokes about vicky holding a hard drive and all the really wrong meanings associated with that sentence, i'm sorry, i can't help it, when i'm tired my mind really does pick up the dirty things in everything, plus it wasn't just me who was making the associations. someone should really record our conversations for amusement sake.

no-one should ever give emma coffee. last night emma had, what can only be described as a mini meltdown, running round, crawling on the floor, doing forward rolls off her bed and hitting the wall repeatedly, it was really amusing til she told me i hiccuped like a moose. her life goals shifted remarkably, first from wanting  to live in a nunnery, where i still maintain she wouldn't last very long at all, and then she decided she was going to give up school, become a basket weaver, in, i think we finally decided on tanzania, and i was going to be her assistant cause i am too retarded to make them myself. all this to get away from doing biology! 

alas, geography revision awaits, as does worrying about what to wear to an oscar themed party on friday night, am screwed, more than three days notice would have been helpful as i need clothes and shoes...all of which are at home...."

haven't written here in ages but am tired and can't be fucked to write a lot. got back from egypt on friday, really interesting trip, etc etc...no i mean it was good, but 10 days of constant travelling right after the end of school was exhausting. still don't know if i want to go to uni in september or take a gap year...hate potentially life changing decisions...have so much work, have to do my year book page and at the mo am drawing blanks on what to put, maybe will leave the page blank...wow that leads me to a very depressing thought path about my time at coll, entirely inappropriate for christmas day i feel...have to start packing up my room soon, as i don't want to come back for exeat so this will be my only oppurtunity, and although my mum officially knows i have been smoking, (whole other story about that one) there are still somethings she better not see...alcohol bottles for one...everyone had better come and visit me, thankfully i'm still in hartley wintney, but the only good thing about this whole move to me living with tom above the pet shop on the high street is the fact that tom won't be there during the week as he'll be on this crazy course, there are no close neighbours living around there and my mum will be several thousand miles away in turkey. i have such a brilliant relationship with my parents...i never see my dad, i'll see my mum for a few days three times a year, and my step-dad i'll see roughly every three weeks...

"event","why do people suddenly seem to think i am good at following instructions, i'm just not, and i think my past record really verifies that, 'hand your prep in on monday...,' now you know that's going to be given in on wednesday at the earliest, 'nicola, don't smoke...,' whoops, 'nicola, stop smoking...,' whoops again, and the list goes on so why do people still seem surprised when i haven't done as they asked, but then again, why do people still bother asking. i don't mean to be unreliable, it's just the way i an, and at this point i don't think anything is going to change, i mean, even stuff i tell myself to do, still doesn't get done like not leaving prep to the last minute, and getting up in the morning more than five minutes before we have to be at school,so it seems completely pointless to actually be making resolutions for the year following my birthday, it never has before, but i feel i should at least try.
1. stop smoking, really really bad habit that must be stopped
2. drink less alcohol, strange that as i turn 18 i'm trying to cut down, i have to say this one i feel probably wont work.
3. at least don't spend all money on alcohol, must start saving money, have just realised if i am living at home alone when my parent's are in turkey, i'm going to have to save my money, so i can, oh i dunno, eat.
4. really, really don't leave work till the last minute, this i feel is the least likely to work out of al of them is the one i am most likely to fail at, have been telling myself this for the last 7 years to no avail, for example am sitting here on a sunday night, procrastinating, with loads of prep and knowing full well that i have no intention of working on monday and tuesday night, but this thought still isn't enough for me to get up and actually do anything, wow, i really need to grow up at some point. 

think those are enough for now, will add in more if i feel the need.
bit bummed out at the mo, mum didn't have the best news from the investors, really home she can sort this out, it's an amazing oppurtunity.
also found out today that my village, darling hartley wintney does infact have a weekly street market, consisting of roughly 4 stalls, i cannot wait to go home and mock it mercilessly, apparantly having a 'community orchard' wasn't enough, or the repetitive village fete which is the same every year, it has to go one step further and introduce a street market,i mean come on. but i have to say i am very fond of my dear village, mum's mention of buying a house cloer to wherever i am at uni feel on outraged ears, and the thought of, instead of them buying a house, they just stay with me at uni whenever they're back here, really did have me completely outraged, unfortunately there really is no polite way of saying, 'really? are you kidding me, that would be hell.' but it was decided that we would talk about that closer to the time, thankfully i don't have to worry about me being homeless just yet.
am off to battle with my hair, after having it cut so short, it has gone about a million times curlier and it's annoying cause it doesn't tie up properly so am going to attack it with hair straighteners as another form of procrastination."

"event","'lonely planet.' i have to say those two words have haunted me since the expedition, i think i actually had a few nightmsres there too, but never did i think i would hear those words ever EVER again, that was until a certain, crazy gap year person came into WWH hall today, high kicks and all, and i think every other word out of his mouth was '...lonely planet' it was insane, i had severe flash backs, that combined with the malibu and cokes last night, which just made me feel like i was back at kipepeo again, it was bizarre.
i have to say in the last few days i have participated more in coll activities, i went to a chamber music concert last night, and rachel and alice were so surprised to see me there, so not me...unfortunately they couldn't also persuade me to go to the holy communion service too, that was pushing it a bit too far i feel. then of course we participated in some extra-curricular drinking, which is always fun, got really dizzy again, nearly walked into several people in my attempt to walk in a straight line. alison worried that we were actually buying too much alcohol, that the bottle was too big and would be a waste, but between the four of us we managed to finish the whole, rather large bottle of malibu which i thought was an impressive feat, couldn't sleep afterwards due to the large about of cola we drunk the malibu with, so lay awake for several hours. 
carrying on with the whole coll participation thing, attended the talk by johnathan porrit this afternoon, about development and it's affect on the environment in the past and in the future, which was really interesting, goes with the whole geography thing i think, whilst of course the whole ucas thing is still kinda sucking to be honest, got a meeting with mrs revell on monday, and still have to cut 200 characters out of my personal statement, whilst doing two geog essays, but you know, none of this really matters cause...it's my birthday on tuesday!!! (although i do have a maths test on the same day) and i fully intend on spending tomorrow sleeping as the next few weeks are going to be mental, st. andrews open day, going to turkey to look at property, driving test, ucas, etc...the list goes on, as does my babbling it seems..."

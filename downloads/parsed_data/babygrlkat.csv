"event",":So...: Last night was kinda fun, Me and Sarah went to the Montgomery football game for a little bit, then decided to leave and find sumthing to eat... After that went to my friends Matt's football game in hughsville for like the last 10 mins of the game they played good thow... even thow matt didn't get to play much I still got to see him in his football uniform lol... Anyways... Then Me and Sarah went to montoursville and stopped @ jack's house for a little bit to chat and shot the shit... Then drove around summore and stopped @ james house shoting the shit with him sum, Then sum more driven around while talking to Sarah's boyfriend and singing on my cell w/ the speaker phone on as loud as it would go... hahaha.. good times...priceless!

:Guy Situation: So... i talked to Gene last nite right before me and sarah stopped to get sumthing to eat... Just kinda of a what's up and blah blah blah... I read his last entry... most of it being about me ... I dont know, he has a point our personalities mesh so well it's unreal... to actually have a person who can understand me as much as he does just blows my mind outta the water...He's a really awesome guys and idk i love him and i tell em all the time... But i dont really know what our situation is as far as dateing wise... At times and i'll be honest... I would love to ... but yet as he's said our timing always sucks ... but then theres some downsides ... he lives in lewistown and i live in montgomery, I dont drive yet cuz i'm waiting till I'm turn 18 which isn't to long away but i dont know if a long distance relationship would work... Another downer is that we have been friends for such a long time I woudn't wanna lose that friendship for the world... and I'm afraid that if we did date and we didn't work out for sum odd reason that I would lose all of that and in no means would I ever want that to happen. So I really dont know what to think or what to say about our situation... I dont know maybe if he comes to see me sumtimes soon i'll be able to have a better output then what I have now ... If you know what I mean ... Anyways ... I'm suppose to call him at sumpoint today but I dont wanna interrupt him while he's working so I think i'll wait till atleast like i dont know maybe 5:30 or sumthing I have no idea but I am most def. gonna call him tonite ... but i'll keep this whole ordeal updated... 

:Saturday nite: I'm prolly not going to be doing much of anything considering Sarah has to babysit and I dunno the two people that i would consider hangin out with either dont have a car or live to far away to hang out for just one nite so... i'll prolly be sitten here like usaul ... but that's nothing new... o well i guess that's all i have to say ... more later I promise ..

"event",":Wow: What a weekend... I went to sabrinas saturday morning and then stayed for the rest of the weekend and let me tell you it was pretty interesting Well first off Nick and his g/f Lauren totally avoided us they where gone all weekend because i was there the only reason that they came back to the house was because me and sabrina had a graduation party for John on sunday and those two didn't even get john a card nor did they even make one ... Nick has def. changed it's not @ all like he was ever since he got back w/ lauren i'm sorry to say but he went down hill he doesn't do anything they just sit around w/ each other like seriosuly dont they ever just need some space alone... like my themselves ... i know i'd get sick of seeing sumone all the time ... but idk that's just me ... anyways there just idk two faced talking shit on people then being like i dont know what your talking about ... there just rude that's all ... but o well that's not my problem... i felt bad because nick and lauren where talking shit on sabrina ... and there was a really bad fight between lauren and sabrina @ the house during the party w/ all of john and sabrinas family there ... then sabrina up and left... so me and john went looken for her ... finially she went back home and so did we ... nothing was settled... that i know sabrina said she didn't wanna talk about it ... lauren was callen nick low for being w/ me right in front of my face ... yeah w/e she think's he's low for daten me and being w/ me ... well she's low for running back to his cheating ass everytime ... plus i told jphn i was just to pretty for nick typelol ... anyways ... lol .. that was kinda mean but fuck if i care he's n asshole and a puss lol that can't even come around his own friends and he said that he got kicked outta his own house just because i was there this weekend... which is bull because i figured they would be here but just ya know we wouldn't talk to each other and they would stay in there rooms like they do ant other time i've heard......well not that i got that out ... some other drama started w/ me and brittany because she started her shit iming me while i was @ sabrinas on the computer sayen i'm running my mouth to everyone ... when i only told two ppl and one was nick who mite have possibly been the father or her baby so wtf... i was pissed she was callen a lil bitch over the internet so i called jess's phone ... and told britt to get on the phone and she wouldn't ... then she finially did but she didn't call me a bitch she just called me a whore and shit ... she was trying to act like she totally knew me when one she dont @ all and two i aint no fuckin whore ... yes i will admite i can be a bitch but i am not a whore ... she's the one the spreads her fuckin legs like butter... slut ... anyways... i think that's about it ... o and the party went okay w/ john and all there was some funny part but i dont feel like explaing them... 

:Thankfull: I'm just thankful that i have friends like john and sabrina i had so much fun this weekend and the best part is i know i'm totally over nick because i saw him this weekend and nothing in my chest had a werid feelings ... like butterflies ... you know what i mean ... well i didn't have those ... which is good cuz that means i'm totally over his ass... which is good so i'm most def. moved on ... i haven't found a guy yet ... but i dont think i really want a relationship rite now i just wanna be single and hang i mean it sucks to see couples like john and sabrina knowing i dont have someone to turn to and kiss that's the only thing i miss about haven a boyfriend ... other then that ... and the companionship.. but that's it ... but i think i've wrote enouight about my weekend... more later

So many thing i want to say and to feel and to be to someone else but i know i can't because the timing isn't right... and idk i just hope my horoscope is right... is said that something new and special is about to come my way and that i should feel no guilt for a new flirty relationship... and it makes me think back to the situation i'm haven in my life right now ... i really wish things would just work out the way i want them too... but i dk if that will happen because usally that's not my luck... i just hope things work out for me in the more positive way... then the negitive...
 
I talked to Gene a little last nite... i really can't wait to hang out w/ him again sometimes it suck i got like so many people including Gene that care about me... that i can't even see to give me a hug on a bad day, nor can i give them a hug when there haven a bad day... i wish... i wish i could change that ... and maybe soon enought i can... i only have one year of high school and i haven't decided if i'm going to college or not ... but if i do i wanna go to one closer to my real friends to the friends that have been there for me for like 2 or more years and that i know will always be there for me that's what's true & real friends are all about ... always being there year after year....
 
Yesterday i watched the movie "" A walk to remember"" w/ mandy moore and shane west... whos a total hottie... anyways that movie got me thinking alot about SO many different things... And theres one person i wish i could tell how i feel... and how i wanna try things w/ him so bad and just god .... it's... so... hard to idk talk to him and not tell him... i just wanna be like god i wanna be w/ you... your everything i've been looken for and i dont care who knows... but i know things can't be like that... but i really hope someday they can... someday things will be okay... that's what i keep tellen myself to keep on trucken lol and just laugh & put a smile on my face everyday... that's the only thing i really can do... Oh and here a quote from the Movie i was talking about ...
 
Love Is...
 
Love is always patient and kind,
It is never jealous,
Love is never boastful nor conceded,
It is never rude nor selfish,
does not take a fence, 
and is not resentful. 
Love takes no pleasure in other peoples sins, delights and the truth
It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope and to indore what ever comes.
 
 
well that's it... more later

I've been trying...with many failed attemps to try and talk to Gene but have failed seems like he doesn't have time for me anymore... but i mean if that's he's new style then i guess... let the knew style fly.... which i'm hopeing isn't but it'd be really nice to be able to actually have a conversation w/ him again, i always loved talking to him because he's just as random as I am, and i love it ... because "" Life is random & so am I"" that's what i say.... because it's so true life is so random in so mainy different ways,... and ... and i guess that's what makes life so fun!

Make Her Feel Good 

Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel?
That wanna make a girl feel,
Make her feel good?
All I wanna know
Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel?
That wanna make a girl feel,
Make her feel good?
I just wanna know 

[Verse 1:]
Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong,
When it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed?
(huh huh huh)
Can't a girl from tha hood find a homie,
That ain't just tryna hang around me?

Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me,
Everytime he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to set a full cat black case?
Stroke cuz he go
(mmh girl no)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie,
That wanna do more than spend money on me?


[Verse 2:]
How come I got a nigga but can't trust him?
Why every answer to my question is a question?
Why can't my nigga be my own lil somethin'?
And every girl on my block can't say they don' bumped wit?

I'm so tired of these so called wanna be hard cold pretenders that
(have no clue)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie,
That I ain't gotta tell how to put it on me?


[Bridge:]
Why why is it so hard
Hard for a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel) 
Why is it so hard
Hard for a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel) 
I just wanna know."

Didn't do much sunday i wanted to go to big andys but my friend couldn't go... the main reason i wanted to go is because i was suppose to be meeting this guy that i've been talking to on myspace... but i didn't wanna go w/ out my friend to dance w/... So needless to say i stayed home... it was boring no one was on and  i didn't have anyone to talk to.. My night was pretty boring lol

Ok so me and jess went out to the club last nite and we where having a blast, but at the same time trying to find our friend allen who like always goes to the club... well we finially found and him hey allen since you dont live far from where i live can you give me and jess a ride home at 1 when this is over... he's like i'm getting a ride from one of the bouncers, so i'm thinking in my head ... i'm fuckin sweared we have no ride, and we really didn't want to call our parnets to bail us out and come pick us up and have them bitching at us... So we left the club about 12:45am and went over the Milton Mcdonalds and used the payphone... while a cop watched where like fuck he's going to say something too us... Try to call my friend dm but he said he couldn't give us a ride... i'm like i knew he wouldn't give us one... So now  i'm like wtf are we going to do i'm like well lets go over the the A-plus and get change for a dollar and a lets get a soda too... so we talked in a jess went in the back to grab a soda and the fuckin cashier is like i can't give you change on a weekend... i'm thinking in my head oooh you dumb fuckin bitch so i stuck the money back in my pocket turned around to jess and was like she said she can't give me fuckin change because it's a weekend... so we got a soda and got  63 cents from the 2 bucks we gave her ... and got 50 cents to call someone else we called two other people and no one answered ... So out last resort... call dm again... so that's what we did jess is like dm please we have no other ways home and... well there was alot of guy standing around us and we where gettin nerous so he's like yeah where you at .... he only came because there was a lot of guys around us... At first i felt really bad... but i dont feel that bad anymore because he wasn't gonna do it in the first place... but one i'll remember that and too i'll also remember him picking us up.. so if he ever calls me when i start driving and ask for a ride i'll say no first then maybe i will come get him over after a he begs... But anyway that was my wonderful nite... Needless to say we did make it home around 1:35am.... and i went rite the fuck to sleep my ass was beat... and  I WAS JUST THANKFULL I EVEN MADE IT HOME LAST NITE....."

But it's okay, i'm just glad i even had a change with a guy like him... i told him at the then end of a letter i had wrote him... that  I hope I had as much of an inpact on his life as he did mine and that he will always have a specail place in my heart... I think it hurts more because he wasn't ever a asshole too me and never treated me bad and i really didn't wanna end things... but i didn't want to stick around for someone who didn't know what they wanted... because I've done that before and it always leads me down the same road or getting hurt... but i guess seeing him tonite and sayen goodbye ... was my closure... i guess.... but idk that's about everything for now... and well i'm def. gonna stay single for a while and maybe kiss a boy hear or there but i dont want nothing else... i just wanna worry about myself.... plus i'm always in a realationship... i think i need a break from them because the whole daten scean isn't gettin me anywhere lol...

oh and i found this awesome poem i wanted to share w/ every1 ...so here it was

AT THIS VERY MINUTE....

someone is thinking of you
someone cares about you.
someone misses you
someone wants to hold your hand.
someone wants you to be happy.
someone wants to hug you.
someone will do anything for you.
someone needs to know your love is unconditional.
someone wants to tell you how much they care.
someone wants to stay up watching movies w/ you.
someone wants to hold you in their arms.
someone wants to see you.
someone wants to be your lover.
someone loves you for who you are.
someone loves the way you make them feel.
someone wants to be with you.
someone wants you to know they are there for you.
someone is glad that you're their friend.
someone is wishing you would notice them.
someone wants to get to know you better.
someone loves you."

It was fun i danced a little bit but when it gets to the point when they bouncers told us that at 500 ppl there where closeing the doors ... IT WAS SO PACKED.. it was fuckin crazy... like you couldn't even move... it was a nitemare...i mean if dieseae's where airborn i'd prolly be did like omg it was fuckin nuts... anyways i mostly hung out with mandy, jess and allen... once in a while baylor would come talk to me... lol i had fun... but the music in the place was way to loud.. i got home around 1:45am and didn't get to bed till 2:00am, and then i got up @ 9:30... my legs are sore cuz i haven't been out there to the club since new year.. but i think the worst part about my nite is that some guy was like looken @ me while i was sitten on a stool @ my table and my one friend had walked away to get his smoke's and this guy starts like grinding on my knee ... i'm thinking wtf are u doing man did i say you could ya know come ride me ... NO!... i gave him a little smile and he's like come dance with me.. i'm like not thanks i dont want to rite now... lol yeah right like i would dance with that freak... yucky... anyways the was the first worst part theres more to come then when i'm leaven the club cuz my and mandy and baylor where ready to get outta there... this once chicked named Bree E. comes up to me and is like why u talking shit on my i'm like wtf are u talking about ur name doesn't even come outta my mouth she's like well Kendra said you where ... i'm like fuck kendra like really i dont even talk to her either... so how in the fuck would she know ... i hate it when bitchs start shit as ur leaven when they know you've been in the club sitten the whole damn time... i mean wtf is up with that... anyways i got over it... but i think the very worst part is that my so called on a break boyfriend... was hitten on my friends ..and then i read the convo and he still says he didn't say it.. and the fact that anything i ever tell him he never ever ever believes me ... it's just so annoying to have someone who says they love you n all and do all the shit and then not even believe what you say but your suppose to believe everything he say's ...it's just retarted... i dunno but if he dont stop the shit i'm seriously completely done w/ him... i can move on... and i'll be a strong single women ... and i dont take shit from people... or even freaky ugly guys who try grinding w/ me in a club, well ur just chillin @ your table... haha ... what a fag... ok i'm done that was my nite and well today sucks ... but o well .... leave a comment if u like... i dont care... later"

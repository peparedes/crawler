"event","I hate you. It's taken me so long to hate you this much. Of course I still love with you. With all of my heart. But guess what, I am my own person. I'm me. Not some creation that you've made. I'm fucking tired of it. Trying to talk about myself and being like well here's the thing, I was with this one girl... or well, since I was with her... or like anything to do with me. I cannot talk about who I am without you coming up ten billion times. Is that what you were trying for? I always knew you were a game player, but after all this time I'm finally seeing just what your game is. 
I could be happy with this girl. After all this time you still get in the way. I don't even realize that I think about you, but yet you're name comes out of my mouth a thousand times a day still. And I'm pretty sure she's over it. 
I guess I'll just always be yours... happy now?"

I'm starting to see that the very obvious lines we set were there for good reason. When my mind started crossing them it was kinda weird, but that I can deal with. Actually talking about it a little? it was just weird. 
I love this girl. She's fucking amazing. I don't ever wanna do anything to hurt her. Actually what I want, is I was to hurt for her. i don't want to hurt because she's with another woman that likes her. I don't want to hurt when she tries to say goodbye. I don't even want to hurt for her pain. I want to know that she's far away, and I want it to hit me. I wake up every morning, and it's her I think about. I spent over an hour thinking about her this morning before I finally decided to text her, cuz I thought maybe she didn't wanna talk to me. And guess what. i still didn't do it. It's like.. i can't get her out of my head. I want a life with her. I toss and turn on nights that I don't tell her that I love her. But then when I say it... I get this bad feeling inside. And it's not because I don't mean it. It's because I know that when I say it, it makes her smile. Every time I say anything sweet like that, I know it makes her think of our possibilities, and how much she cares. And so, I like to keep her attachment as low as possible. So I just don't say things like that. But then she thinks that I don't actually feel it, and she decides its time to walk away. And then I freak out. And then it starts all over again. 
I want to think about it, I want it to bother me, I want it to hurt me, before it's pushed in my face. 
I know she's different. And I know that I'm much different now than I used to be... like, everything is different... but sometimes it all reminds me too much of how things were between us. And then I just hate myself. 
I don't know if I could ever try with you again. because yes, I am an idiot. And you deserve the world. And I suck at relationships. Yeah, I hate her for how she treats you. But I wouldn't give you what you need or deserve either. I hope that you find someone who truly loves you, wants to give you everything, and treats you better than anyone in the world. 
I do love her so fucking much. I just wish that I would have been the one to hit rock bottom first. I don't care about me. I want to feel that she is safe. And my heart is a cold bitch."

"event","you told me once that it feels good to get things out. That it's important to... So I'm going to. But I'm hoping that afterwards, we can forget that I said anything. 

I feel like part of me may be begining to fall. But it's something that I should have done a very long time ago now. Then maybe I would't be in the situation that I am in today. Looking back, I should have been the one apologizing. I'm sorry for what I did. I'm sorry for how selfish I can be, for the fact that part of me wishes you would have waited. But that's not very nice of me. You deserve more than the pain I cause. 
After awhile I was scared that you might get rid of some of the things yo wrote to me. I don't think I ever told you this, so please do't think that I'm a freak, but I saved some of them. I didn't wanna forget the small amount of time we shared. 
I knew that I was lucky before, but I was so bitter and full of hate I didn't see it very much. My trust issues were so bad I told myself that everything you said was a lie. I met you at the worst possible time in my life. So today I went back and I read some of those things. It was really hard. Actually, less than halfway through your first letter I was balling my eyes out. For a short period of time I had the most amazing thing in the world, and I was completely blind to it. 
One good thing for me came out of it for me. I learned to not be so stupid. That I don't have to trust everyone, but sometimes it's ok to  let go a little. I guess I got a serious wake up call... but not at the time. months later I realized how stupid I was. But it was too late. For awhile I wished that I would have tried to get ahold of you when I first thought about it, two days sooner than it happened... but I know that that probably wouldn't have changed anyhthing. you were already moved on. Which is good. I'm no good for you.
I was scared of how sweet you were. Of how innocent you sounded when you were talkig about your feelings. I never wanted to hurt you.. and I was horrible. i still don't understand why you put up with me today. But I'll say, I'm so thankful that you do. You're the best friend I've ever had..."

why haven't I done my own research? I'll tell the doctor what meds to give me this time, since theirs never seem to work.
I fall asleep only in hopes of dreaming, that everything will be like it was before.
R.I.P. my Betty Spaghetti
God do I miss you.
You died all for my stupidity.. you deserved so much better than I ever gave you. I'm sorry.
And because of that guilt I freak everytime I leave the house. What careless act is going to curse someone else too?
I miss her a lot. Too much I think. Because from what I've been told she doesn't even talk about me... she doesn't even want to talk to me, that's obvious.. What we had is now dead to her.
Like I've said she is to me, 
but she never was
and after that, she for sure wont be now. 
But whatever. 
I should go straight...haha... that's the first time I've ever said that. But I'm pretty good with guys, currently have them surrounding me like fucking mosquitos.. .he'd treat me good if I let him. But what do I do? I obsess over the day that she might come back.
Yeah right Jasmine.Get over yourself, It's pretty obvious that she was using you all along anyways.
And you... yes YOU! you know who you are. FUCK YOU! Yes, I want you back in my life, but not to try to hurt me. Not to bother me on purpose just because you have such beautiful women surrounding you.. what the fuck ever. 
There's no doubt in my mind I'm the best you will ever have, and you wont even take the chance... so HA!
Shamanna's doing a lot better. She'll probably never be ok.. but she's doing better. We're talking more... and I can somewhat understand what she's saying now. I missed her a lot.
""You're my best friend in the world, how can I love anyone more than you?""

"event","About my sanity mostly. 

See, in the past when I've gotten really stressed out I've felt like I was somewhat losing my mind. Which I'm sure everyone does. But I tend to see things and hear things that are obvious to even me that there is no possible way they're even there. 
It started a couple years ago and it was only once in a long while. Well lately.. it's been happening a lot. Almost all the time. 

And it really hit me today, am I ok?

And I know I've been told this a million times before and it even makes sense, that people who ask if they're crazy really aren't. Because those who are don't question themselves because that is their reality. 

So I'm always telling myself that I'm not crazy because I know that whats going on isn't real. And maybe that's not all I'm worried about anyways... 
Who really knows..

I just know that there's too much shit going on right now. wayy to much for me to deal with and slowly but surely little weird things are happening. 
And I hate it. 
I'm such a paraniod person I just can't stand it. 

I don't even know why I started writing this. 

I guess I just know the feeling of losing your mind. I remember the first time it really happened to me. It was one of the most amazing days of my life. I remember how it felt and there has been times that I would have given anything to have been able to get it back. But I have too much shit going for me right now. 

I guess a lot of it I can't talk about on here.

"event","I miss writing. I miss getting it all out. I miss how I used to just be able to do it. And how I wasn't afraid to let my journal learn things about me. But now it's like I can't even admit to myself who I am. Why after all this time do I still think of myself as her ex. Is that all I'm letting myself be? A part of her past?
But that's not even it. I loved myself. She showed me that I deserved it. And if she couldn't love me I didn't deserve the love that I was giving myself. It's like I lost myself when she said goodbye. I sent every last piece of who I was over the phone and into the nearest garbage can on her side of the country. 
Then, when I was all gone, all that was left was a memory of her. And that's why I did the bad things I did. I didn't know anything else but that. She was all that was left inside of me and I didn't know how to exsist anymore. 
And now that that is gone. I've lost how to even be her anymore, I don't remember anything else. I'm left with the one thing I knew before her. 

Drinking. 

I don't even know myself anymore. Some days I wonder. When something happens I actually have to ask myself, Jasmine, how do you react to this? 

It's like I'm reteaching myself how to walk and talk and be a human being. 

I know it's pathetic. 


I hate myself when I'm drunk. It's like, after that first shot of the morning I just break down. I tell myself every day, today will be the day. Today, I'm not going to need it. But then I see it, whatever kind of alcohol is closest to the coffee pot, since that's the first thing I do in the morning. And... it drives me insane. Every little thing I try to make as an excuse, this isn't going my way so I can drink. Then I'm like,no. Then, I don't have anything to do today, so I can drink. Then I'm like, no. Then, It'll help my nerves... 
then I'm like, no... 

And I always do it. 

and since I'm always drinking, I'm always hating myself... 

But I don't know myself sober. 

I can't sleep. I can't eat. It's like I literally don't know how to live. 
you should see me on sober nights, I remember the first one I had in almost a half a year, I literally layed there in bed that night and asked myself, how do I do this again? and I tossed and turned for days.... then about three days into it the physical withdrawls set it... I don't think I can ever go though that again...
well, I don't want to. 

I'm stuck at my dads house, I've been sober for days... I can't think straight. I'm shaky. my body hurts... thankfully not the all over body cramps I went through the first time. I was literally stuck on the kitchen floor and couldn't move anywhere. I was stuck there crying. 

that's not anything what I wanted to write this entry about. Actually... I don't know what I wanted to write it about. 

Well... there was lyrics to a song I wanted to post... there's mixed feelings about it....



Lyrics to The B-Side To The Truth :
I hate the way that my words come together at your expense
Wish that when I wrote I wouldn't have to be so honest
Show some tact or show some class or maybe just some respect
I'll respect you when you respect me, what can you expect?
I'm just being honest

I still fight the urge to call, I know there's nothing to say
I still love you and I think about you every day
It's not easy for me though I know I act like it is
Feel the pain that hurts so bad I guess I've gotta fake it
Just like I've gotta say this

That this song is the b-side to the truth
About how I really feel about you
And I know sometimes my words they burn like hell
But I still want you, if you can't tell

It's hard to see you I know that we've got to act like we're friends
Force a smile, fake a hug and try not to act nervous
""How am I? I'm good, no great, no perfect, life's just a treat""
Ask you question after question, I don't want you to leave
I just want you to see

That this song is the b-side to the truth
About how I really feel about you
And I know sometimes my words they burn like hell
I still want you, if you can't tell

I've got the keys if you wanna roll
I'll take you anywhere that you wanna go
We'll climb in the backseat like when we first met
I'll lay on my back while you lay on my chest

I've got the keys if you wanna roll
I'll take you anywhere that you wanna go
We'll climb in the backseat like when we first met
I'll lay on my back while you lay on my chest
While you lay on my chest

This song is the b-side to the truth




Especially... 
I still fight the urge to call, I know there's nothing to say
I still love you and I think about you every day
It's not easy for me though I know I act like it is
Feel the pain that hurts so bad I guess I've gotta fake it
Just like I've gotta say this

It's really hard ya know... just looking at them.. all the beautiful pictures. I wish I would have gotten over my shit and told her that I loved her a long time ago. 
Here's my problem, there's so many things that I would not give up that I've been through... it just wasn't meant to be. I think I get it now. No matter how much I love to think about it. How perfect it would have been. How amazing she is... it's just for my dreams. She'll never be mine. She was good to be for awhile.... and I got more then I deserved. 
It's... it's still hard not to call sometimes."

First... don't just see part of a conversation and assume you know how I'm feeling, or that I hate you and don't want to talk to you anymore or something. I would tell you exactly that if that was it. 
I just... don't want to start shit, but found out a couple things from a couple different people about you talking more shit about me and more of what you've said in the past. Things that you either took wrong or completely made up, and that's not cool. 

I tried to be there for you no matter what. I tried to be a good friend, and from what I can see you just walked all over the friendship I tried to give you. And I just... have too much shit going on right now to think about it too much. 
I will always care about you. And if you need anything, or someone to talk to, you know I'm always here. 

And that thing about you being a dollar, the only thing I can think of is some application that I added to myspace with buying people and being the boss or something. And like, the bid starts at $1 or something... It just confused me so I clicked yes on a bunch of people and gave up. I've never said that you're only worth a dollar. 

Next time if you want to confront me, just have the time. Cuz it's not fair for you to say that you're done and not give me time to explain what's going on and why I didn't go to you in the first place. 

Honestly... I think you talk too much shit about people that you wouldn't say to they're face.. and if everything that I've heard you've said is true.. well, that's just really fucked up. 
When did I once try and get you to cheat on anyone? and when did I try to get you to do stuff in bed with me?
and how exactly did anything start between us? do you not remember? it usually wasn't me. 
I know that I did get a little in over my head fast with the whole feelings thing.. but honestly, it's just how I can be at times. But for anything that I ever said to you, did I not get something back? in writing or not? 
And when months and months ago you told me that you felt bad, that you'd found karma and you were going to try being a better person, and I know you kept talking shit about me, who knows about anyone else. 

I don't want to start a fight... I'm sorry I brought all this up. It's just been bothering me for a long time."

The Risk-Taker needs an adrenaline rush to feel true sexual excitement. If it's forbidden, you're the first in line to give it a try. Defying social conventions turns you on like nothing else. If it's liable to get you fired, divorced, or ex-communicated, you're into it. You're not likely to ""listen to reason"" because level-headedness is at odds with your needs. Many risk-takers practice some form of danger-seeking in their daily lives, but some of them only fantasize about it. Danger is an aphrodisiac to you, and you are drawn to it in and out of bed."

And like, no ones giving me any credit for it. I am seventeen years old and neither of my parents have ever helped me with any schoolwork my entire life that I've been homeschooled. I dropped out of public school almost five years ago, and I'm still a year ahead of my self, and oh my god it's not even college level yet. Well fuck off, at least I can do shit for myself. I wouldn't be anywhere now if I had to count on my crappy ass parents. 

I'm having no luck finding a job. I work saturdays, that's it. And it doens't matter if I work 13 hour days they wont pay me for more then 8. And I have to work for as long as they need me. It's fucked up. 

I'm taking off to oregon on thursday. I can't fucking wait to get away from everything and everyone here for awhile. I'm so over washington. 

Hopefully I'm going to Mass in september, but I gotta kiss up to my dad and get some money from him, since that's really all he's good for. 

I'm totally in love.. I don't know what to do. This woman means the world to me....
and it's never going to happen. 

My best friend, my love and my world.. is doing meth. And there's nothing anyone can do about it since she's over 14... fuck do I love that girl... I hate seeing and not being able to do anything when she's practically begging me for help.

I'm confused. 

Do you know that I still cry about you all the time? You're still... it. And you'll never know who you are. 

Because there's so many poeple I talk about... hahahaha... 
Not like you're going to read this anyways... who even gives a shit about what I have to say. 

I've become a very bad friend... I'm not ditching them like I did last time, that was totally fucked up... but I've recently been rerealizing who my real friends are and who needs me the most. 
I'm trying to get everything together lately. It's not going so well, but I'm really really trying. 

Fuck... There's too much else to say that I can't... There's so much I need to tell someone... 
but I can't. 
I could never do that. it'd fuck up too much for too many people. 
I hate holding this much control of lives and happiness.

Sometimes when we touch the honesty's too much
and I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides



or more like the fear in you subsides. 

How could you have done this? and why did I let it happen? I guess I had more faith in both of us than I ever should have. 
You really are a... I can't say it. 
I love you. 


But... why did I write that much to someone that had no idea that this livejournal even exsists? someone that even if she did, she would never take the time to read it. She wouldn't even listen long enough if I wanted to sit her down and tell her.

I don't think I'll ever let you read this letter, but there's some things I kinds just need to get out. 

I've been completely numb for so long. I haven't felt shit... till I met you. There's been so many amazing girls that haven't gotten me anywhere. I thought it'd never happen again. I'd given up by the time you came into my life. But Rachel, there's just something about you. And it happened out of nowhere. I never thought you'd be the one to push me over the edge. Bot that it's you, I believed that it just wasn't possible. But I've fallen so far so fast. 

I've come to love you so much. It's hurting so bad... and just knowing that you don't feel the same. You've come to form such a big place inside of me for yourself. I wish you'd take it. 
It's killing me knowing that I can't force you to feel the same. Or take what I want to give you.. But I'd never try. Even if I knew I could do it. 

I have to leave you be. Let you figure yourself out on your own. And if I'm ever it,. I have to learn to take it for what it is. And if your friendship is all I can ever have, I have to tell myself to take just that... I don't want to lose you.

I know by now I sound like a total pathetic freak. But you have no idea how much this all means to me. 


I kept telling myself that yeah, I had feelings for other people, but right now I need you. And now that I can fully admit that I'm in love with you, I've realized why...

9-26-07
It's the way your eyes
are so un-mine
that wakes me want them the most. 
To make you promise to feel
as I hide behind my walls.
But if you'd help me,
I'm sure the glass is thin,
you could shatter them
with just a glance.
Physical pain means nothing to me now. 
I need something more
something deeper
that I really might feel.
So I'd help you break through
if you promise to make it hurt.
Cuz I'm lost
and I'm numb
and I'm done trying this on my own.
So wait just a month or two, 
make me falls
till I've lost it all
please make me see
that I can do this again
and let me really be free.

I got my wish. That's all I needed... I needed  you to help me really feel again."

Interactions with others become a bit strained; the passionate Scorpio Sun requires the depth of emotional intensity while the clever Gemini Moon needs to stay closer to the surface. Fiery Mars forms an uncomfortable quincunx with wounded Chiron, challenging us to move past our fears instead of frittering away an opportunity for intimacy.

Not only with life and things going on, but with me. and out of no where last night around almost one in the morning, I was at a party.. and out of no where, I couldn't take being with people. Just because it was work.. I had to strain myself to talk to them or anything... for the last while that I was there I sat in the living room where no one was on the phone to my friend...Emotional intensity? I'm feeling more lately.. I'm more letting myself somewhat get hurt.......challenging us to move past our fears instead of frittering away an opportunity for intimacy........ I'm done running away from things... I want to talk to Rachel.. I want her to know what's up. 

Now another one...well, it's from the same place, they kinda go together..

You may not be able to relax enough today to feel fully at ease. You can sense that something big is coming down the path, but you cannot possibly know how to respond until you know exactly what it is. Don't push for a solution; clarity will return in time and you'll be able to take definitive action. 

And I also got like a tarot reading or something last night.. and I'm supposed to have someone new coming into my life soon... most likely someone I don't know at all, but it could be someone that I already know that will try and get closer to me... and they will be very smart, and helpful.. and just great. And they will be a very big thing to me.. but I have to watch out, because especially if it's someone that I know at all already, they will be very strog witted and cunning.. and wont try to do good things at all...
And I'm very excited about this. Not the bad things part.. just someone new comeing into my life.. I could use a change right now before I go fucking insane... 

yeah.. I guess that's about it right now. Everything else in my head is too scattered up to find words for any of it."

For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

Oh, oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

Oh Oh Oh Oh 
For the longest time
Oh Oh Oh Oh
For the longest time
Oh Oh Oh Oh
For the longest time

I don't think I'mr eady for a relationship... like I think I even was like a couple weeks ago. But now, enotionally I don't think I could take it. And for once in a really long time I want one. I like her... I really really like her. And I miss her... already.... She's so... I don't even know. 

I cut myself... because I needed to cry... but it didn't help. I thought it might make me like it always did... this time though I just laughed at myself and realized how pathetic I was freaking out over nothing.

Give up on an unrealistic goal, if it was meant to be it will come back to you.... or it was something like that. Now... Fuck off. 

SO I know I sbould give up, but... I don't know. It's not like I even have any hope or anything. I'm not a very hopeful person anymore.

Her though... she could do it to me. But she wont. I'm not the one she wants and I madly wish I was.

I want to cry and not be able to stop for days. I want to remember the stomach wrenching pains and the nausea. I wanna feel like I still need physical pain. I want to want to cut myself. I miss the fresh scars. I want to be built up and have the rug pulled out from under me again. I want someone to help me stand on my own two feet again and then throw me oever that ledge.

"event","I'm sorry... I honestly am. you have no idea how much I've been thinking about things today. 
I never meant for you to get this link. But one day I was randomly reading my friends profile and I saw that she had a link to her livejournal in it.. and I was like, huh. how come I never thought about that? and I put it in there... then Friday I think it was I had just about the biggest spazz attack when I thought about you or Hailey or my dad or something getting it... so I took it out. You hand't said anything, so I thought you hadn't read it. 

Yeah, I can't go back and change things. And I'm not going to say that I regret anything. But I feel bad... I was a bitch. I'm sorry for what I did. I should have been more honest with you all along. It would have never gotten to this... remember a while back I asked if it was possible to turn into your ex? yeah... this is pretty  much what I'm talking about.... and you still probably have no idea what I'm talking about. 

So.... I never lied to you. Not once or at all... but reading this was probably like a whole nother something, huh? I do that... I try not to. But I don't anymore... not at all. I'm completely open from now on. I hate the shit that I get myself into cuz I just can't fucking be honest and open. 

I should have told you right away when I felt things changing... but I didn't know how to. It literally happened in about four or five minutes. ANd then I was just lost and confused. Like what the fuck just happened? 

I honestly was never just trying to get you to fall for me... at least not that I know of. And I know I have to take blame and I can't make up excuses... but sometimes I just don't know what the fuck is happening in my head. And with you, it's really been like that a lot. 

**

So today I'm going through my phone, right? deleting old pics that I don't want anymore, and texts that I've had for way too long... it was crazy. The memories that I have in there that I've forgotten about. I have things from back in February when I got that phone.... cuz you see, I have this problem where I don't delete text messages if they mean a lot to me... and well..... there were some from you. And it brought back things that I'd forgotten about totally... and just the way it used to be and the way I felt... even if it was just about a little over a month ago that things started changing with me. I'd totally forgotten... and then, out of no where, I missed you. Lately I've been so pissed off at you, I haven't wanted to talk to you or anything... and missing you... I don't know....

And ya know what I usually do in a situation like that? I act all sweet...I tell stupid little lies to make it seem like I didn't do anything and you have no idea not to like me anymore. And I get things all better, and make you fall for me harder... thing is... I care about you. I care about you a lot.. and I can't do that. Yeah, I want you in my life. But you mean too much to me to keep doing to you what I've been doing. I can't know that I'm hurting you...

If you still want to be in my life, that's fine with me.... and you know I'll always be here... but things can't stay the same... I couldn't take that. I'm done being horrible... I think this is the first time in my life I've been so set on it.... 
But the thing is, if you need time away from me I completely understand.... I just need to be honest with you from now on... and I'm still not so good at it. But I'm trying... 

So yeah... it's all up to you whatever you want to do."

Beautiful Disaster lyrics by Jon Mclaughlin.

She loves her mama's lemonade,
Hates the sounds that goodbyes make.
She prays one day she'll find someone to need her.
She swears that there's no difference,
Between the lies and complements.
It's all the same if everybody leaves her.

And every magazine tells her she's not good enough,
The pictures that she sees make her cry.

And she would change everything, everything just ask her.
Caught in the in between of beautiful disaster,
And she needs someone to take her home.

She's giving boys what they want, tries to act so nonchalant,
Afraid they'll see that she's lost her direction.
She never stays the same for long,
Assuming that she'll get it wrong.
Perfect only in her imperfection.

She's not a drama queen,
She doesn't want to feel this way, only seventeen but tired

She would change everything for happy ever after.
Caught in the in between of beautiful disaster,
But she just needs someone to take her home.

Cuz she's just the way she is, but no ones told her that's ok.

And she would change everything, everything just ask her.
Caught in the in between of beautiful disaster,

And she would change everything for happy ever after.
Caught in the in between of beautiful disaster,

But she just needs someone to take her home
And just needs someone to take her home."

Mom, 
I miss you. Yeah, the past few day's that you weren't drinking you kinda really drove me insane. But I was happy that you weren't drinking. I don't think you'll ever realize how much it hurts me... and Jesse. He wanted you home so bad tonight. You should have seen the disappointment on his face when he was trying to talk you into coming home. Why'd you give up?
I miss our relationship. I miss when I used to be able to talk to you. Back when you used to b e there for me. You might think you have a year and a half with me, but you have no idea who fast that time will go. And at this point I don't see me coming back. I have nothing to come back for. I'll have Jesse come and say with me some... I don't wanna see you. 
I don't think you get how much you hurt me. You just don't get it. Yesterday, I really did have a fucked up day. Lately, I;'ve been having a massive mental breakdown. Have you noticed at all? And yesterday, it had nothing to do with not monopolizing the phone and internet. I enjoyed the time alone. 
Do you get that I really don't have a life? I'm stuck home all the time? And that's why I'm on the phone and computer all the time. What the fuck do you expect me to do with my time? Clean the house to make you happy? That's not fair to me.
Ya know what? I'm done. I'm going to play a game with Jesse, spend time with him to get his mind off of you. You should see how bummed he looks.
Fuck you mom.

Love always,
Jasmine.

And this is a journal entry I wrote tonight, I am going to trigger it, just because... well, if you think you might be tempted to cut, don't read it..

It's crazy. Something that happened so long ago can still throw me so far over the edge. Over a month now. I've done so well,

But sooner or later that razor decides it misses the taste of my flesh. The sight of the blood is what forces me to do it. The thought of it pouring down my arm, the memory of the taste as it runs over my lips. Have you ever cut your lips? I haven't. But I'm considering it right now. As I hold the piece of metal in my hands I long to squeeze, tearing apart those lines I could never figure out how to read. Life lines and love lines. Just dumb creases that give people too much hope, if you ask me. The side of your wrist stings if you don't push deep enough... who stops at one? That's my problem I just want to keep going. But what if she sees it? I think I need her right now..."

"event","A little journal entry I wrote today...
~~~~~~

I'm breaking down. I don't want to let myself, but I think I need to. IO've been ahving a massive mental breakdown over the past couple days, butnow I'm really cruing and freaking out. It started when my mom left for work. I sat here and watched her pull out the the driveway and rerealized how much I love her. I tried to call her to tell her and it went straight to the voicemeal. She was calling me at the same time to tell me. We're not getting along at all... adn it's killing me. I miss her so much. I'm one in less than a year and a half... I'll never be able to live without her. 
This isn't who I wanted to be. Just abuot none of me is. I can't care anymore. Yeah, I do care about people and things to a point, but I don't give a fuck. I just can't. No matter how much part of me wants to. Even most of my best friends I could calre less if I ever talk to them again. I've known her for almost thriteen... my mom just called... she heard cants in the cradle and she's crying too.. what the fuck?... I've known her for almost thirteen years now, and I'm giving up on someone I love more than anything... because she'd depressed mostly. No, that's not why, it's because of how she's acting towards me, but that's because of the deoression. And I just can't take it anymore. 
I went to the doctor the other day. I weight more then I have in years. Yeah, I'm also taller lately, but it scared me. I look thinner... but I still hate it.
It's like I need there to be something wrong with me.. maybe to feel slightly sane? Does that make sense? So I have an excuse? People say I'm not totally crazy... and I know that I'm not. But my head's just not working likme it used to.. it scares me. My mood swings are coming back. I'm thinking totally fucking psychotic again.. but physically I'm just blah.. And it's driving me crazy. 
I miss Ani too mych. I still love her more then anything... for that I feel guilty.. but it's saving my life and my heart right now. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now this is random updates I guess...
~~~~~

When I went to the doctor the other day I had a bunch of blood tests done, and there's something fucked up with my liver... as soon as this virus thingy I have is totally gone I'm going to get more tests done to see if it's really bad. Honestly, I'm scared it's from drinking too much. I don't think that I ever drank way too much. And I cut back. It's been over a week since I've been drunk... but I think that drinking may have helped it... so I'm going to try and quit.. haha. right. Like that's going to work. 

She's... oh god. She's fucking amazing. I want to be good for her... I want to be fucking perfect, and everything that she needs... but I know that I'm not. I know that I will do her no good, and she's better off without me in her life. I'm just going to fuck things up for her.... I've tried to tell her this.. but it hurts. And she wont listen to me. Now... here's my really big problem with her. I'm a healous person.... a really really jealous person... but I never let it show. not at all... and I've realized with her, I can't help it. I never let people realize how jealous I am of something.. but it just comes out while we're talking... I hate it. I try not to let it.. but it just does. 

I had another ultrasound today.. I do still have gallstones. Why I haven't had an attack in over a year and a half I can't quite figure out.. it's driving me crazy. So, I probably am going to have to get my gallbladder taken out.. so not looking forward to that. But I know that it's best for me. 

I blame the heat for this bread down I've been having.. this fucking heat wave is crazy.. it's over 90, and it's only 1:56... It's going to get worse... today is supposed to be the worst day... but it's not going to end for a couple more days... I don't know how I'm going to live though this. 

Well.. there was something else I was going to write about.. but I just realized that that person might read this. so I can't... and yeah, there was something else too, and someone else can't read it.... damn.... maybe I'll srite about it on myspace... or one of my other million LJs... and I think I have a Xanga... haha... oh wow. Let's see if maybe someone figures some things out by that. if you do read it... there's your secret... and I fucking hate you. 

My ex moved... like, a couple hours away.. and I already miss her. I don't have feelings for her. And I don't think that I ever did. I just liked having someone here... but every time I talk to her, I miss her so much... I've only hung out with her like two or three times since we broke up in April... Now I don't know when I'm ever going to be able to see her again.. 

Yeah.. I guess that's it for now. If anyone read that... thank you. It means a lot to me."

This fucking urge to open up to her is driving me crazy... But I can't do it. I wont let myself. I have to force myself to not say so many fucking things to her.. And there she us. She just texted me.... grr... 

Sometimes I think that just maybe I need a distraction, and I really don't like her that much... but I don't know. She's all scared to be vunerable.. and wanna know what? As of right now I'm the last person in the world that she should let herself be vulnerable towards.. cuz I Just don't care about shit.. and I know for a fact that I'm going to break her heart if I keep doing what I'm doing.. 

Why am I trying to get her to fall for me so hard like I am? Cuz I know for a fact that I'm not falling for her quite as much as I'm making her believe. But I'm not doing it on purpose... it's like it's just happening. Or am I falling her her that much, and just trying to make myself believe that I'm not. Cuz I do stuff like that.. I'm so tired of being hurt. Like maybe I wont let myself fall for her till I know that I have her.. then I'll let it all happen.... 

But I can't do that.. I remember last time I did that. It wasn't that long ago... and it broke me for life. I'll never be the same... that's why I just don't count on people anymore.. I don't let myself get attached.. I ready myself for anything, so when it comes, I just don't care. 

But then there's Ani.. She's getting in the way of fucking life. But I can't let her go... I don't know what I would do without her.. She still do this day means the fucking world to me. And I once again mean fucking nothing.. but I Love her so much. I've fallen for her so fucking hard again.. As of right now, she's the only person in the world, that I'd give myself to. That I'd promise myself to... Really... she's just the only one... And I wish it meant something to her. 

So yes, my feelings for Ani are getting in the way of her... I hate it.. but I think it's for the better. 

Not girlfriend material? And do you even want to tell me things like this? no.. just fucking keep locked up.. don't tell me shit... just know that I miss you.. and I feel a lot... but honestly? Just forget.. let me go. Don't do this to yourself... you have to stop it... cuz I can't, no matter how hard I'm trying... You're such a strong person.. just say no to me."

Lie To Me 


[Verse 1]
Why didn't i listen to my heart
When she had me guessin' from the start
More and more i wonder
Why do i still want her 
After all the love i gave to you
All this pain i'm in because of you

[Chorus]
What am i supposed to do 
When it's all a lie
Where am i supposed to go
When it's dark outside
What am i supposed to do 
When it's all a lie
Lie to me [6X]
One last time

[Verse 2]
Still had those letters from last fall
And everytime the phone rings
Wish it was your call
More and more i wonder
Why do i still want her
After all the love i gave to you
All this pain and all beacuse of you

[Chorus]
What am i supposed to do 
When it's all a lie
Where am i supposed to go
When it's dark outside
What am i supposed to do 
When it's all a lie
Lie to me [6X]
One last time

[Bridge]
Why did you have to hurt (to hurt)
Loved you for all your lies (your lies)
One thing i know is true
Ill never stop
Lovin' you
So tell me

[Chorus]
What am i supposed to do 
When it's all a lie
Where am i supposed to go
When it's dark outside
What am i supposed to do 
When it's all a lie
Won't you lie to me lie to me baby
Lie to me lie to me baby
Won't you lie to me baby
One last time"

"event","So, I'm listening to this cd that I haven't heard in a while, and there is this one song on it that I always liked, but it never really meant a lot to me. But....now it's like...wow...it really made me realize some things. 

Maybe things aren't going in my life just how I want them to...fine...I'll stop lying to myself and anyone who just might read this for some reason.....

Maybe there is something in my life that isn't working out how I want it to...but I can't do a lot about that. I just need to accept it how it is. It's not what I want..yeah, maybe it's broken my heart. Maybe it's not the only reason, but it's kinda thrown me over the edge back into this depression...but that's how it is. I just need to...maybe not exactly move on. But give myself the chance to. Give myself room to grow, change and all that good stuff. Just believe that I deserve at least something....

At times I think that I try and make myself believe that I'm a bigger bitch then I actually am. But then...sometimes I think that I'm one of the worst kinds...I don't even notice things that I do until they're all done and over. I don't think about how much of a bitch I am until it's kinda thrown in my face....but...no one...no one in the world get's exactly what's going on in my head and how bad it is....cuz I don't fully get it....and...honestly?..I'm not ready to show it to anyone. 

And in some ways I'm strong...it's kinda a amazing feeling...but then...sometimes I realize how much of a weak ass I am...I look to others to tell me how I feel about things...why can't I just figure it for myself? it's kinda driving me nuts. 

..............
I'm too young to take things so seriously....don't people think that I fucking get that? I do....I realize how young I am....but ya know what? I don't really fucking care...
................

AND......I have a crush.....and it's getting bigger......................I don't like it...it's wrong..I shouldn't have it.....it's not going anywhere, and I'm...being stupid...but whatever.......

I'm having all these thoughts...ones that I kinda want to get out....but I don't wanna talk to anyone about them....so.................nevermind...I can't tell you...

you....don't know who that you was...the whole world I guess...

I have a secret.......I have a couple secrets...it feels so amazing....I forgot how much I loved the feeling of having something all to myself....

maybe they aren't big....but I love them all the same..."

"event","So I took the entry off private...I get what you're saying and why you want to say it and such...I just...really don't want you to read it over and over again and like build up all this anger for me or something...But yeah..have fun with it...

I want you to know that I never lied to you, I really wasn't into it with other people, and I was confortable with you...I wasn't comfortable with other people....

There's just one thing that's really pissing me off...maybe I should be writing this in my other one, or emailing you about it, but whatever..I need to get it out now before I forget...like, ok. When I got Jayna's phone number, you were all, ok. it seems like you're already over me now...and then what I told you today and you're like, saying how I'm totally over you and all this shit...Well...what the fuck? Three days after you broke up with me you were dating Steph...did I say anything like that?...I guess to me it seems somewhat like you really don't care that you've lost me as your girlfriend...I get the distance. I really fucking do, it was driving me crazy too....but, god..this actually hurts to ask you....do you honestly care whatsoever that I'm not your girlfriend anymore? Or were you always totally over that?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ok..I'm gonna stop now...I started thinking about things..I need to be able to get to sleep tonight..right...I can't sleep worth a shit....member all the chest pains? I've been paying more attention to them. They're not totally the same as the ones I have when I have an anxiety attack, but I think that's what it has to do with...some type of anxiety disorder or something.

~~~
now this song..I'm totally in love with it. Like the part about the mask...It's amazing....just one part I'd change, the hate part..I'd say I'm your love, I'm your love when you want hate........

ohh, and the whole I'm your life and I no longer care...not so much so...maybe the other way around...but I'm not gonna get into that now.....

Wanna know what I don't get? How I can be so angry and hateful, and just like..freak out. Almost go off on things so many times....but yet like..I'm not all that angry...is it just how pathetic I am for stupid reasons that I'm not going to talk about right now? 

And there's something in my head, and it's probably not good..it shouldn't be there...but for some reason I really like it...

I'm gonna go to hell......

But I....enjoy this....

"event","It's time now to let go of any emotional wounds you have received in the past, especially concerning issues of romantic love. Naturally, this is easier to say than to do, but your best path to healing is through clear communication. Everything won't be fixed with one quick conversation, for you are undertaking a long-term project. Embark on it today to maximize your chance to heal. 

Part of my horoscope for today....kinda scared the shit out of me...

I have to go get ready to go to my grandparents house..I really don't want to..I just want to be alone, but at the same time I don't...I just want to break down, but I can't...I start, and it wont come...if I could finish, I'd be all for it...but no...just little bits of tears here and there...massive anxiety problems....When I think I can't breathe all that well....I need help, I know...but I can't get it. And it pisses me of...

"event","I believe in poeple. I believe in people too much. More then they could ever believe in themselves, so that's why I'm always let down....But, for some reason I don't think that I ever once believed in you too much....I think that I just believed you too much...I think that you can go and do whatever you want, I think I've believed in you more then just about anyone in the world...but I'm not wrong about you. I know that.....I just have to tell myself not to believe everything about someone again...and I'm getting better at it.

I don't believe anything anymore, everything is a lie...and I like it that way.

I started thinking about this a couple days ago, about why I'm saying sorry so much lately...I always have said it a lot, but it's getting more and more. And I really think it is that I'm just trying to believe tat something could be my fault. I've always blamed everything on other people, no matter what it is, and I've felt totally powerless....and when I do think that I have conrol over something or someone, it was never real, or it all just disappears...so I'm saying sorry...to juts about everything that people say...just to feel powerful...to think that I've caused something...so I can believe that I've done something to someone....

So, yesterday someone told me that she hated me....and she says that she had to say it, but she doesn't totally mean it...and I totally get it. When someone breaks your heart, and you hate them more then anything. And you just want to scream at them, and beat the shit out of them, but yet you'll never love them any less, and that's why you keep talking to them..you keep trying to get them to fall for you more....but when she said it...I don't know...it was almost orgasmic. I loved the way it felt to have someone say it...and I actually wanted her to say it again, but she wouldn't....I told her to freak out on me..but I couldn't get her to.....

I live my life to be accepted, and have everyone agree with me. And not judge me, so I put up my mask, whatever it is I think they want to see in me....but the whole I hate you thing, I think that was just knowing that I've caused something...I'm the reason for some big amazing feeling that just eats you alive...

I always thought that if I broke someones heart it would be an amazing feeling...I always wanted to do it..just to cause someone the pain....but yet, when she said it. I almost started crying....it doens't feel as good as I thought it would...it doens't feel good at all...

I guess....I can hate you for making me think that everything was fine....and I do. You made me think that you were happy, that we were all cool...and it was just more of the lies...I hate you for what you did..but i guess I also have to thank you, because I really was happy...for just about the whole time that I've known you, and especially the two months that we were together, I was really truthfully happy....so I thank you for that. 

The thing that bothers me a lot, is when you said that you probably had a little laugh about it...the whole fucking Elyse when you had the breakdown, and lying about it...I never did believe your story, but when I asked about it you freaked on me and made me feel all guilty for caring at all...we were fucking dating! How do I have no right to care?

And the ass, that wasn't even a big deal to me....why did you lie about it so much? All I asked was if something clicked in your head, was it a hot ass or not? You liking that one chick, whoever it was with the tests or something like that, woudn't have freaked about that either...yeah, maybe I'd be a little jealous, but I wouldn't freak out on you....

This is what I think...you knew what you were doing to me the whole time. Even if some of the time you didn't totally think about what you were doing, it was somewhere in your head...you built me up there, making me so happy. Making me think that everything was fucking perfect, and you loved me oh so much, you were mine until I didn't want you anymore...you promised me things you knew you wouldn't be able to keep. Just to tear me down...because you knew that you had control over me. You say that  you didn't...that I don't have many weaknesses. Maybe I don't have all that many weaknesses, but you know all of them...you seem to be able to find them better then I can....but wanna know what I think? I think that if you tell me I have a weakness or a fault, I'll believe it. I'll make it into a weakness or a fault...you tell me that I can't do something, and I know that I can't..I believe it. And you say that you never had control of me, because I couldn't be controlled....right. You know how easy it is to control me, and you knew how much control you had over me, and you loved it. And you took advantage of it...

I think that you love the fact that you hurt me.... that you were able to break me so hard...and I just fed into it...oh god Bri, you broke my heart, I loved you so much...you were my everythig, I'll always love you.....and you just fucking love it.

Ferris Wheel

there is no dark side to me
you said to me that night
what you see is what you get -
there will be no surprises you said
and I believed you as much as I could
but there were signs of the opposite
deom the minute that we met
and part of that is what made me trust you

cause you would not lie and you could not steal
any more imagination from inside this ferris wheel
that is my own  desire to be different someday
more like you are... is getting in my way

there is a dark side to me,
I promised you that night
what you see isn't always what you get -
there will be some surprises I bet
but you appeased ,e as much as you could
'cause there were signs of divinity
in my struggle to  be free and 
aprt of that is what made you love me

'cause you would not lie and you could not steal
any more imagination from inside this ferris wheel
that is my won desire to be different somday
more like you are... is getting in the way

deep inside my lovers oven
is there hope to melt the sugar
that begets he bittersweet
ribbon candy tripping over 
all the lies and slow surrender
that is champion of defeat in matters such as these
in my attempts to please you... in matters such as these

Tell me exactly
what am I supposed to do?
Now that I have
allowed you to beat me!
Do you think that
we could play another game?
Maybe I can win this time?
I kind of like
the misery you put me through.
Darling, you can trust me
completely.
If you even try
to look the other way,
I think that I could kill this time.

Rah! Rah! [x2]

It doesn't really seem
I'm getting through to you.
Though I see you weeping so sweetly.
I think that you might
have to take another taste,
a little bit of hell this time.

Rah! Rah!
Lie to me!
Rah! Rah!
Lie to me!

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now run for her life
in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?!
Is she insane?!
Will she now run for her life
now that she LIED TO ME!

You always wanted
people to remember you.
You leave your little mark on
society!
Don't you know your wish
is coming true today?
Another victim dies tonight.

Rah! Rah!
Lie to me!
Rah! Rah!
Lie to me!

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now run for her life
in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?!
Is she insane?!
Will she now run for her life
now that she LIED TO ME!

Ramidi ma ma ba di ma!
Ramidi ma ma din do!
Ramidi ma ma ba di ma!
Ramidi ma ma ba di mo!
[all x3]

Is she really telling lies again?
Doesn't she realize she's in danger?

Eeeeeeeyow!

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now run for her life
in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?!
Is she insane?!
Will she now run for her life
now that she LIED TO ME!

The little bitch,
she went and she told A LIE!
Now she will never tell another.
A LIE!
The little bitch,
she went and she told A LIE!
NEVER FUCKING LIE TO ME!"

"event","I realized just a little  bit ago, I'm really depressed....I know that I have been more then usual lately, but like..wow...it's getting really bad...I was filling out a survey for myspace and like, with all my answers...it was scary...so I decided not to post it. The last time I posted a couple my friend actually asked me if I was depressed...I didn't even really realize it...

Whatever...I'm used to it...it's all coming back on me now..stupid me thinking it was possible to be happy...

I'll never attempt that again...

right...I will..I know myself oh too well, even though I try to make it seem like I don't..no, of course I don't realize what I'm doing..it just...happens...

and I lead people on..I fucking hate it...but lies..oh god I'm so good with them..no no no. I'd NEVER EVER play mind games with you...haha..right..I enjoy my mind games. I like being a bitch...and no one get's why I do things...they just look right past it...and I do everything I can to get in there and just...

*poof*

and I just erased your memory...you didn't read any of that...you're imagining things...I'd never say something like that..I'd never admit...I mean uhh...who said that?

wow...I'm a total fucking dork..

So I ate...I fucking ate food..and wanna know what's really funny? both times I just wrote ate I actually wrote hate and I had to go fix it.....probably because of what I was thinking..I fucking HATE myself for it..but whatever....I'll find a way to punish myself for it somehow..

Why am I being so honest? why am I writing all this and actually planning on posting it on public? because I'm a fucking dumbass...and no I don't just want attention...I just really don't fucking care about anything right now...

yes I do..that's all I do with my time now....care..fucking pity myself..well I'm over it. I'm fucking over everything..

but at the same time, I'm actually really happy right now...kinda..to a point....not really...but if I thought long and hard something might make me happy...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ok..I...wait...not happy....................ok...I got it..god I'm so good.I get coffee in the morning! yayness...now I kinda want to wake up.

I want to go back to counseling..I miss Deb...she was fucking amazing, and I was never honest with her...well I'm ready to be now, but no one gets that I need it now more then I ever did in the past. My head is seriously fucking up..

So, fucking dumbass me got out my rubberband again..when was it? today or yesterday....and I put it on my wrist, so I'd have it there anytime I needed it..Well I took i...it was yesterday..I took it off today, I'm sure I'll put it back on though, I only took it off cuz it pinched me when I moved my hand..I don't like pain like that..I only want it if I cause it on purpose..So I'll snap my wrist with it till it's raw and it hurts to fucking move my hand at all, but god forbid it accidentally snap me and I freak the fuck out..

I guess....that's it...

fuck you..."

Bri, remember how I told you when I went to that concert and I heard that song and I started crying cuz all I could think about was how much I wanted to be with you? Well, I thought it was just that one time, with all the couples...well I listened to that song again a couple days ago, and I cried again...I don't know why I think of you so much when I hear it....but here are the lyrics to it....

C'mon in, yeah welcome to my life

Grab a cup of coffee
Check out and pack my car

All the girls are pretty

So i promise to grab my soul 
And leave my ego at the door
I'm gonna open up my eyes
So, c'mon sing along if ya wanna
Cry if ya hafta
Lean back into your lover's arms
Grab the hand of the person
standing right next to you

Yeah, see I have 4 bags, 2 guitars, my friend Jen
Who helps me remember that its the fans who got me where I am
So if I close out a show and I m still 40 dollars in the hole
You know, I just put the room on plastic 
And sleep another night on an unfamiliar mattress 
And wonder where you are.
I wonder where you are

So im gonna grab my soul
And leave my ego at the door
I'm gonna open up my eyes
So, c'mon sing along if ya wanna

I'm still honest with you. I don't lie to you about anything in the world...I just don't talk to you as much..and I hate it...I really do hate...I don't know...I'm not saying that I want you to drop everything to still be able to talk to me on the phone all day every day still, I just hate the thought of losing you...and I know that I'm not going to, thank you for not totally dropping me....just growing apart from you...You really are just about the best thing that's ever happened to me..You've helped me with a lot. I hate it when you say something about how I don't need you, because I have everyone else..you need to get that I do need you..you're still usually the person that I go to..and the only person in the world that I don't keep anything from...you never let me explain to you why I kinda freaked when you called me your ex...I get that we were together and we're not anymore..I am your ex...it just made me realize that it's in the past...and I just want to believe so bad that we're not in the past. Maybe we're not together right now..but I hope for us in the future....but that's probably just wishful thinking..I just need to get over it and move on....

Stevi..I really am happy that we're talking again. I did miss you, and I never want you to be someone from my past...I like having you in my life. Yeah, there's things that have kinda really pissed  me off and such...but I'd like to work through them all..I uhh.....had something to say and I'm trying to remember....when we were talking yesterday, and we were listening to music...listening to that song and talking to you, it was the weirdest feeling..I didn't start crying, but for those few minutes that it was playing, I totally felt how I did back when we had our thing....I'd forgotten what it felt like...and truthfully, I'm glad that I have a way to relive it...

and you know that if you think that this is game
well I am not joking

she is tired of being broken

The future looks bright ahead,

Till the end of time.

I love you because, because my heart is ligther
honey everytime, everytime I'm walking by your side
and I love you, yes I love you because the future is a little bit
brighter
and the door, the door of my happiness, you open wide
No matter what may be the style or season,
I know your heart will always be true.
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons,
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hold me close, hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand from the start
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart

Ev'ry time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling, you're all that I'm living for
I want you, I need you, I love you
More and more

I thought I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that
I will go on loving you eternally

Won't you please be my woman
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die ev'ry time we're apart
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart"

Every Night 
by Michelle 
Every night, when I lay me down to sleep,
I want to reach over, to feel your lips so sweet.
Although I know I cannot be there,
You will always keep me from having any fear.

The sheets are very cold;
I feel like I'm in a huge hole.
What if we never meet?
Would my life be any better yet?

I long for the day we lock eyes;
I want you to be surprised.
As much as you may imagine what I'll be,
I can only be me.

So every night, when I lay me down to sleep,
You are in my mind with me.
And right before I fall asleep,
I wish upon that star for you to be with me.  


~~~~~~~~~~~~
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one
thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my
own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come
true
All I want for Christmas is you

I
don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing
I need, and I
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang
my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus
won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever
know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
is you, youuuuu, ooh ooh baby, oh oh

I won't ask
for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow,
and I
I just want to keep on waiting
Underneath the
mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay
up late
To hear those magic reindeer click

'Cuz I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me
so tight
What more can I do
Oh, Baby all I want for
Christmas is you, youuuu, ooh baby

All the lights are
shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of
childrens'
Laughter fills the air

And
everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
The one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly, yeah

Ohh ohh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This
is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Ohh ohh, I just want
you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my
wish come true
Oh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you,
you ooh, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, ooh
baby

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Innocent, that's my way

Don't know where I am

Catch my breath, can't think straight

Gotta make a plan



But I get butterflies

Water in my eyes



'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name

Fragile when you call

This could be the nearest thing to love

And I'm fragile when I hear you speak

Fragile feeling small

This could be the closest thing to love



Shake and sweat, wipe my brow

Scared of what's to come

Lie awake, toss and turn

Am I the only one



But I get butterflies

Water in my eyes



'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name

Fragile when you call

This could be the nearest thing to love

And I'm fragile when I hear you speak

Fragile feeling small

This could be the closest thing to love



But I get butterflies

Water in my eyes

When I think of you

I could break in two



'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name

Fragile when you call

This could be the nearest thing to love

And I'm fragile when I hear you speak

Fragile feeling small

This could be the closest thing to love

I'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before

Now I see
This is the way it's supposed to be
I met and now I see
This is the way it should be

This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own

So come to me
Now we can be what we wanna be
I love you and now I see
This is the way it should be

This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own

I'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before
(This never happened before)
This never happened before
(This never happened before)
This never happened before
(This never happened before)
This never happened before

Fuck Bri that hurt... really bad.. but thank you.at least you were honest with me."

"event","Soo...... I guess there's been quite a bit going on in my head... I think at least. I'm not so sure what it all is though. 

I fucking hate my computer. And I've been so angry towards the entire world.... but Bri, when you call me, I hear your ring and your voice... or you text me or anything.. fuck. just the thought of you, and I'm all happy.... It's like... weird... I'm totally different then I've ever been. I saw Jeremy today, I ignored him.. I haven't done that in over a year and a half... I was busy thinking about you. I didn't start freaking about how much of a bitch he was or anything.... I seriously never stare at other people or follow them around or anything. Yeah, I'll see someone hot and be like, she's hot.... but I forget about them instantly. Like, they were never in my head at all... never once have I been like that at all. 

Stevi... if you ever read this, I'm gonna apologize right now. I didn't snoop really, didn't read anything at all.. kk? promise.... 

So stevi asked me to keep her main hotmail open while she was in jail. Just log in once a month or so to make sure that it doesn't get closed... well, I started thinking about how she told me that she had every email I ever sent her saved so I clicked on the mail folder.... it was there.. and it was still titled mah beautiful....... 

I guess I really don't know exactly how to explain how I felt when I saw it... Truthfully? I think I liked the fact that things have been over for so long, and like.. at least somewhat she was remembering it.. whatever it was exactly.... 

When I read her Xanga... I think that hurt more then just about anything ever had. It was like, I knew that she liked Wendy, but I thought it was us... I thought we were gonna be together forever. I din't think about her wanting to be with other people..... It was just the two of us forever and for always... and then I find out that she was thinking about this other girl while she was telling me that she'd only want me for the rest of her life. She was never gonna be with anyone else, and she didn't want anyone at all but me.... 

It's been a month today since the last time I cut.... I'd like to be all, I'm so proud of myself. I can't believe I made it this long. I'm doing so good.. .I'm trying to quit.. well, yeah. All that's true... but cuttings not a big thing to me. When someone I love and care about does it then yeah... but I could care less if I cut all day every day. I truthfully don't care what it does to me... I guess somewhat why I quit was cuz I knew that when it came up, or Bri would ask me about it or something, I thought that she was blaming herself for it. And I know that it's not her fault.... I don't want her to feel guilty for what dumbass things I do... So I stopped cutting... 

Bri I've liked you a fucking lot for a really long time... I'm pretty sure you know that. And I'm a jealous bitch. Before we were dating, I freaked when you told me about fucking other poeple.... but not only that, anyhting that showed that you thought about anything in the world but me.... Then once we were dating, I was like, yes. She's mine. She can't be with anyone else... I guess what bothered me the most was that I gave you the option of it being an open relationship, but either way I wasn't gonna be with anyone else. I just wanted you to be comfortable. And you said that you weren't gonna be with anyone else... you weren't gonna fuck anyone else or anything.... god when you told me that you had sex with Elyse... like, my stomach dropped so fucking far and hard... it was horrible. I don't think I went thrity seconds all that day without crying. I tried so hard to blame it all on her.. that she took advantage of you while you were breaking down... But.. I don't know.. I really don't know why I started writing about it... I try not to think about it at all... I'm sorry.. 

I don't even go about looking for attention from random people as much as I used to... 

I can't fucking stand my mother anymore. Everytime that I'm around her I just feel like a worthless piece of shit... Just how she obviously hates it when I talk. She either tells me that she doesn't want to hear it or she doesn't have time, or how she rolls her eyes.. or that sigh that she does as soon as I open my mouth. So I tell myself that I just wont talk to her anymore... I try so hard not to. I try not to bother her or piss her off or get in her way... but all I want is to talk to her. I want to be able to be close to her like I used to be. I want to be able to tell her everything again... I really do miss her. 

Sometimes I wish that I could just hate my father again so I wouldn't feel so guilty for keeping so many secrets from him.... I know that he wouldn't freak... god.. he's an amazing person. I know that just about anything that I tell him he will either fully accept or he'll at least still love me. He'd be there for me... 

I'm totally pulling back from people. I don't want to really talk to most people I know.... all the time I wish that I could just forget that the world exists..

I hate myself for how much I've been eating... I'm massivly disgusted with myself all the time... I feel dirty and wrong for believing that I should be allowed to eat. 

I guess... I'm gonna end this now. My mom just came downstairs.... god I hate her."

Today could be demanding and somewhat frustrating as you find yourself engaged in routine affairs. Focus on organizing your world and opportunity will follow. It's a great day to consider investing in long-term endeavors. Don't let disagreements with a loved one regarding money ruin your day.

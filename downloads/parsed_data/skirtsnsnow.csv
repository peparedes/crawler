Before we had left, I noticed something yellow squirming around in the grass, being the curious girl I am, I wondered up to it, to be greeted by a little snorunt!

The first thing I noticed was the frightened look in her eyes, and how she was shaking frantically. I scooped her up in my arms and gave her a light hug for comfort, suprisingly, she didn't try to jump out of my grasp or anything! I headed back to Snowpoint to go to the pokemon center, to get her checked up to make sure she wasn't hurt or had contracted that rare pokerus disease I have heard about. 

She's perfectly fine, and I honestly thought she was one of the cutest pokemon I had ever seen. So, as you have probably already guessed, I've got a new pokemon now! ^^"

"event","Long time no post! We had a HUGE storm, which knocked my internet out for around and week. D:


When summer starts, trainers flock to Snowpoint, since the weather isn't quite as harsh as it usually it, and let me tell you, we've had a lot of challenges, so I have been busy.

I've got to wrap this up, because I'm going to walk with my Weavile to the lake. &lt;3
Buu, you all have nicknames for your pokemon, why can't I ever stir up some creativity for mine? 

Byebye~!"

"event","&nbsp;Hehe! I've finally gotten my first entry up. And it's about time, too.&nbsp; ^^;

So, uh, about my day. It hasn't gone so well. 
We received only a single challenge today, and it was just that certain trainer who caused a lot of chaos in my gym. 

The kid ran in and started to crush the balls of ice like every other, but when he only had two more to clear, he became frustrated and grabbed a handful of snow, packed it into a ball, and sent it hurling at Isaiah (why he did, I dunno, young trainers are just stupid like that) . The snow ball smashed into the back of his head, and caused him to fall down.

To make this short and sweet, one thing led to another, and all of the Aces in my gym began to have a snow ball fight with each other. Anton ran at Allicia, but tripped over a pile of snow in the process and tumbled down the ice levels. He ended up breaking his right leg.

Poor guy, I bet his snover doesn't feel to good about his trainer getting hurt. 

Jeeze, that wasn't very short, huh? Oh well, I guess that's what you do on this site anyways. 
Soooo, yeah, that's pretty much it. ^-^"

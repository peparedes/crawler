"event","Okay I got back from Tennessee with Ashley and Celena Sunday. I have never been happier to be in my own bed. I don't use my bed but to lay on it but hey! Thats just as good right? NOW IT IS!
anyways... In Tennessee 90% of the time we went swimming in the lake. I LOVED IT! I made them go swimming with me... Alot. MWAHAHAHAHAHA! We went to church like atleast 5 times, (I didn't have a problem with that) and ... ate... ALOT. EVERY night we stayed alnight on the houseboat and had a wonner roast/ marshmellow roast. It was nice. I had to watch The Phantom Of The Opera 14 times. 
MOVING ON... Now i'm back so thats all that counts. But on days as hot as yesturday... I wish the lake was next door. *sighes* 
Wel I'm leaving. 
CHOW!"

"event","Ok everyone. It has been FOREVER since I wrote on this LJ thing.
We have six more school days left of school. HOW SWEET! I can't wait for the summer. My summer sounds booked but its not when I look at the calender. I AM GOING TO JROTC CAMP! How freaking sweet. Going to Kings Island on my Y-G trip and oh yeah, Marching band. It starts like 2 weeks befor school starts or more. SO THATS WHY MY SUMMER SEEMED BOOOKED! 
                                        Moving on...
I wreaked today. Wasn't bad but I had a cuncution aparently. I didn't know I did. I didn't feel it till I woke-up laying in the middle of the road with cars behind me. LoL. Okay here is how it went. Today when I got home from school I laid down and took a nap till 730. I woke-up and asked Ernie would he go rollerblading with me. He was like, *sure. We could use it!* So we went rollerblading and I noticed my right blade was REALLY lose at the bottem and WAY to tight at the top. I was like well effe. It will live till I get home. So Ernie got tired and desided to turn around. WEELLLLL... I keep going and there was this BIIIIIGGGGGGGGG hill. I skated up it till my sweat came from my teeth. (ALOT of sweating) When I got at the top of the hill I turned around and flew down the hill on my skates. Ernie was just alittle ways infront of me and there was a car behind me. Ernie asked me to stop and wait for him so (if you have ever been to my house, there is a big blue house above mine) I started slowing down. As I started slowing down I didn't see any rocks so I went right (with the bad blade. STUPID BLADE) and started tripping. I couldn't keep my balence so I feel in the road and rolled over into the ditch. Ernie said I past out. He said he tried to wake me up and trash but I wouldn't. He said people stopped and asked did I need help and was I okay but I didn't answer and he told them to go on. He said until Madison got there I was out of it. I had to clue what I was saying or anything (Like I remember. I didn't even know ppl stopped) When I got home my head was hurting REALLY bad. I started rubbing my head and felt this big pump knot. I was like *holy crap* I tried to go to sleep. But my mamaw keep hitting me. She said *NOOOO. You will die* I was like *I DON'T CARE! I'M SLEEPH!* I felt this sharp pain in my hip and in my neck. When my mom got home she took me to the hospital. When I was in the car on the way to the hospital I was looking over myself and notcied millions of cuts on my leg and my back went to crap. We got at the hospital at 949pm and got out at 126am. The dr said I can't do any activitys that I could get bumped on the head for two weeks, or I could go into ceisiers. (how ever you spell it)Well.. Thats my story so I am leaving.

"event","So... I just found out my friends like to talk about me. Well... Not totally good. But hey I like to hear the brutal truth. It's SO about time for someone to tell me. LoL. Well If you all can talk about me, SO CAN I. It's wrong of me to but hey. What can I say. I'm not a very friendly person. 

Hylton: You know what? You can change your posts on this live trash. PLEASE do. PLEASE. It's not like I'm afraid to hear that trash, but if it gets to *B-F* our relationship could be like... SO over. I don't want it. I love him like... ALOT, but like I said I've had other things on my mind. Don't you when you talk to Jordan? PLEASE change it and don't use names on my comment thing and like I said. If you want to talk about me, talk about me to my face, not to these people that reads L.J.'s. If you talk about me behind my back, thats how I lose like 99.9% of my friends that I HAVE lost.

Tim Hall: Hey princess! LoL. I'm sorry I just think it is so cute to say princess to a guy. Its like a oxy moron or something. LoL. Anyways. Love you and hope to see your prblems will work out.

Sara: Yeah for once I'm on Hylton's side. You have to find someone else or your never going to get over poor Shawn. I have to agree Ashley W. done you wrong but, didn't Shawn also? I love you though. Your like one of my best friends. LoL. I love you though doll.

Candice: I LOVE YOU SOOOOOOOOO MUCH. Don't let some slut get to you and some little 10 year old looking boy hurt your feelings. That ho has a boyfriend and she forgets about him when another bot comes around??? WTF? She don't love him than. She don't love no one. Thats what a ho is. DUDE... But you can't let this get to her. NONE of this trash. I love her too. She is one on my lezbo's but I don't like some of her ways. Thank for making my page tight! 

Tackett: Yeah... I'm with Hylton again. You REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY need to stop talking about Bryan and Jesse and Justin. I'm SO tired of hearing their names. It's killing me. Everytime I hear there names I wanna run to you and cut off your head even though you aren't the one saying there names. Thats how annoyed I am. It's getting bad. Like REALLY bad. Atleast when your around me, don't talk about them unless it's been like.... 65790678975467546544 years. PLEASE? I love you though.... STILL.

Ashley J: I LOVE YOU SOOOOOOOOO MUCH TOO! Your like the best friend a girl could ask for. Cheer me up when I'm down, give me your shoulder when I need one, and always, ALWAYS, helps bring me back up when I feel like nothing else could go wrong and just wanna go to a corner and kill myself. I love this much. <-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------> And then alot more. Thank you.

Celena: Your just like Ashley but... No... Your not. I changed my mind. You put me downer when I'm the downest I could get and when I'm the happiest I can get, you make me happier. Don't know how you do it, but LoL. I love it. You make me more down but I laugh at it. LoL. Then it like starts over form the happiest I could EVER get whenI am the downest person on the face of the earth. LoL. I love you. Your so dumb. Your one of my fourths of a brain. LoL. Much love to you. 

Madison: You need a g-f bad. A g-f that loves you ALOT and won't treat you like you should die. Anyways, Lets go fourwheeler riding again sometime another. I have a blast everytime I'm with you and so does Danilla. I you all so much.

Danilla: I'm going to miss you so much when you go back to Brazil. Make sure you stay in touch with me. Much MUCH love to you. 

Cindy: Black ISN'T a bad color. People are gay and don't know what they are talking about. They all need to die or something. LoL. I am going to miss you SO bad. DON'T LEAVE ME HERE. I love you. 
Danny: Hey girlly! I love you. Your pretty cool to be Ashleys bestfriend. LoL. ((Sorry Ash))Thank for letting me borrow the books. Love to you.

Stephine: I love you little one but man, your getting annoying when all you say to me is mostly your brother hates me, and all you wanna talk about is Peanut. It's getting really annoying. So please. Cut the trash.

Julie: I love you! Your my favorite! Member that forever! Oh yeah... You need to find a boyfriend. Make that faggot feel like trash... *NASTY* Just THINKING about such a loser make me sick. *cough cough* For real. LoL.

Sarah McCoy: I love you. Your pretty cool. Even though your like one of my best lezbo's ***Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*** Don't tell my wife, I LOVE YOU ALOT! 

Ashley Little: Your my wife... I would never cheat on you. LoL. Don't read Sarahs or Julies post... I'M NOT LEAVING YOU. EVER.

Ben: Like I said. I odn't hate her. I PROMISE. I just don't like some of her ways. I don't like ALOT of my friends ways but hey... I still love them. She don't like me that well, but ahhh... I'll get over it.

"event","Well... Here I am sitting at home (of course), getting fat (OF COURSE), eatting (whatelse is there to do). Anyways I have just desided that I am making a cure for boredom. It will the BEST cure in the world. Better than the cure for illnesses or the cure for rapers. I promise it will be the best. I will start on it... One day. Maybe not today... Maybe not tomarrow... and maybe not the day after tomarrow, but one day. MAYBE NOT EVEN THIS LIFE TIME! (<<<I like that idea<<<!) 
Moving on...
Finally we go back to school tomarrow. It feels like I have been trapped here FOREVER and it has only been 3 days. Yeah think thats bad. You should see me in the summers. (NASTY) Can't stand me. I should know! Well... Not I really have anything important to say so if you want to stop reading my trash... Its more than okay. Not like I will come and shot you dead or anything... (Not right yet anyways). *Laughs evil* Man... I need a life. Like really bad.
Well... If you haven't stopped reading my trash yet you should now because your just wasting your time reading about my boring life that I don't have. You wanna hear my boring life? Good! Your going to because I can do whatever I want since this is my page thing and your just a reader and well, I'm running outta things to say. 
Wake up
Eat breakfest
Go to school (sometimes)
---When I'm not at school I'm playing nitendo---
Come home from school
Go to my room and play nitendo (Tell me you knew that was coming)
Bet the game (Figures. To much free time to do nothing)
Around 10 or 11pm go do homework
Get done with homework then go to the kithen and eat
Grt done eatting and go take a bath
Get outta the shower around 1230 or 1
Go to bed or get on internet
Than start day from the top again!!!

See how WONDERFUL my boring life is???? AYE AYE AYE?! Its so FUNNNNNN! BORING! Boring boring boring. SOMEONE PLEASE KILL ME NOW! PLEASE! I mean I live with my 3 brothers, my dad, my mom, and pets when my cuz.'s deside to come down. (Every night almost) Just please kill me! I will give you the gun. You can kill me so I don't have to waste my time on it. It would give me something to do from being bored but I don't think I could live with the thought of killing my other selves. HAHA. Get it? Get it? Yeah... Didn't think so. Well... If you haven't stopped reading this yet AGAIN then do so now. I must warn you, what I'm about to say is BADDDDD. You see it allllll started with a man and his dog. That man loved that dog, but that dog didn't love that man. One day, the dog turned on the man turning into a man eatting 50foot wilderbeast/rabbit/little girl scoot girl/your mom and chewed off his head! The man eatting 50foot wilderbeast/rabbit/ little girl scoot girl/your mom lived Happy Ever after with a mans body and a full tummy that got filled with a head. THE END!
Yeah... It's time for me to leave now because I have nothing more to say so... STOP READING THIS YOU IDIOT AND GO TAKE A NAP. Naps=YAY!
*kiss-kiss* Love to ya! Uh-Buh-Bye!"

Christmas was better than I thought it was gonna be. *I thought I would hate all 100% of it, nahhh... I only hated 89% of it* New Years is gay. Why does people say happy new years and no one is EVER happy when it turns to the new year? I don't get it. I don't get human life form. Weird little cookies if you ask me. Moving on... I wrecked my dirtbike. It hurt... REALLY bad. I got scarps and scars and bruses and trash all over my body now. My back is a new mess (again). Ah... School is finally coming back in so I can't wreck EVERYDAY now. Only on the weekends. Tee-Hee. Well... I'm really sleepy and can't get this effe'n song outta my head. I'm going to kill stupid CD's.

I got back from Florida like Wednesday or Thursday one with my dad and Jenni Bartley. Let me tell you... I didn't wanna go, and I never wanna go again. I sat and got even more fat that I didn't need. I mean look at meh... Do you think I need to gain a couple pounds???? DIDN'T THINK SO.

Uhmmm... I really don't have nothing more to say... WAIT... Scheeler had baby!!! She's so cute. I want one. GERRR... She so cute I could eat her *bites off baby's head* TASTY! 
I played nitendo a while ago and I beat my last score!!!! MA HAHAHAHAHA. Not like you all wanted to know that but if you didn't wanna hear about my boring life than well... Don't read my l-j because it talks about nothing but my BORING life. Ahhh... And me finally got done with my whole room. It's hot! I need more pictures of alot of people so I can add them to the back of my door. IT'S SEXY!!!
          
           I hate it that you treat him like crap as he treats you like you are the queen.
           I hate it that you don't talk to him when your/his friends are around and yet he only wants to talk to you when they are or are not.
           I hate that he talks about you 24/7 and you are the biggest whore EVER.
           I hate it that he is my best friend and I don't want him to get hurt,
           But I hate it the most that I talk about you behind your back and I don't want to. You do so many things that it is hard NOT to talk about you.
                I'm sorry but I can't STAND you. I hope you die. You know who you are and it's not hard for anyone to tell because everyone feels that same about you as I do."

"event","<p>To Mr. Obama,<br />&nbsp; You want to win the next election? You want a surefire strategy to dominate popular opinion? No worries, I got this.<br /><br />It&#39;s really quite simple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not take a single dollar, a single dime, a single red cent, in corporate campaign donations. Nothing, nada, nil. You already sit on what is quite possibly the most visible and powerful speaking platform in the entire world. In this day and age, all you really need to communicate to a worldwide audience is a laptop with a webcam. Sit yourself down in your office, turn that badboy on, and explain why and how your next term will be purpose driven to serve the American middle class.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If people want anything from a politician these days, they want most for someone who is NOT bought by corporations, someone whose morals and decisions cannot be swayed by the almighty dollar. Someone who will fight for them to have a fighting chance to live a decent life, make a decent wage, and have more security in their future and that of their children. This requires someone who is completely and sustainably on the side of the working class. As soon as you receive money from the corporations (who have their boot-heels on the throats of the working class), you are tainted goods. Endorsing (or taking endorsement from) that behemoth makes you part of the problem. Part of the beating we are receiving. That boot in the face is both unpalatable and adversarial.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you still win the election and carry on with full corporate sponsorship? Probably. Do you need oodles of money in order to win the popular vote &amp; popular opinion? Not at all, and you&#39;d probably do much better without.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, you already raised a bunch of money from corporate interests? No worries. Give it back. Even better, collect a few hundred million from the biggest companies you can find. Stack it up to a billion. Stack up 10 billion. But don&#39;t use it for campaigning. We already know your name, you already have the ability to get your voice heard everywhere, you have an automatic shoe-in to every debate you want to take part in. Take that money and cut a check to every man woman and child in the United States. Maybe it doesn&#39;t amount to much when it&#39;s all divvied up. Maybe a dollar, maybe five. That doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s a symbolic gesture. It&#39;s a statement that goes something like this,<i> &quot;This isn&#39;t about me, this isn&#39;t about money. This term is about YOU. The working class American. I won&#39;t be bought, I won&#39;t be swayed, I won&#39;t cower or capitulate. I will fight to give back to the 99% what they&#39;ve worked for the last 30 years and have been robbed of, what is rightfully theirs.&quot; </i><br />(You can probably say it better, your charismatic speaking skills are quite notable).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, don&#39;t let it be just words this time. Mean it. Fight for it. Start every legislative battle from the position of what&#39;s RIGHT for the majority Americans, not just what you think you may be able to get enough Republican support for. Be fearless, be steadfast, be outspoken. Don&#39;t just be presiding over the White House, OCCUPY IT!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if you need reference for this activity, just take a look around the entire world, millions are setting an example for you.)</p>"

"event","Sitting inside with the wifey, it's a rainy, chilly 52 degrees outside, heading to the mid 40's for the overnight low.
Considerably cooler than typical weather for August here in Bavaria, but I'm enjoying it. :)

So, update time. 
Guess I'll jump back to around the time of my last post/rant. During the week after arrival I got fully enrolled in health insurance, got a bank account, and registered with the civil authorities that I'm officially residing here. Everything went smoothly. After spending that week together, Nadine went back to work. I've gone along with her some days, riding in the delivery van as she drives her route (she works as a small parcel courier). Other days I've stayed home, working on some artwork, music, and generally taking it easy. For the most part I was going every other day or so because riding along in the van does a number on my back injury and I let it unwind the following day. Regardless I've had fun riding along with her and being able to spend that time together. The week after I arrived we went to Schloss (castle) Dennenlohe for a garden exhibit. It was very nice and I&nbsp;will have pictures up soon. We've also been to Ansbach, Illesheim, Bad Windsheim, and several other places. Kicking around some of our old favorite places, reminiscing on good times, and making new memories. Mostly on the weekends (which are generally only Sunday for her), we've been staying in, so she can get some rest. We've been to a couple of flea markets, wandering around and looking at the goods. The flea markets here are a bit different than the ones I've been to in the US. There are a fair share of vendors who make flea-marketing their full-time gig, but a lot of people selling at the flea markets are there with a bunch of old stuff from home that they don't want anymore. So something like a flea market meets the garage sale, all lined up along the sides of the cobble-stoned streets of the 'altstadt' (or the 'old city', the part of the city that tries to stay with traditional architecture, traditions, etc). This past Saturday, we also participated in a flea market in Hilpoltstein. Brought a whole bunch of old stuff from home, the whole family, and some food and drink. We sold some stuff, and were pleased with the takings. Mostly though, it was a nice day to spend together, hang out and talk and do some people watching. Tomorrow we'll be going to the zoo in Nuremberg, which should be fun. 
I've been to the doctor once so far, got a prescription for some heartburn meds, and picked up those meds from the pharmacy, for a grand total of $0. Also went to the dentist yesterday and had an exam, x-ray, and a wisdom tooth pulled (thing has been hurting for 2 years or more, never had the money to get it taken care of), the grand total being a whopping $0. (I'm on the wife's health insurance policy, which actually doesn't cost her any extra to cover me). So for my experience with socialized medicine as a civilian so far, I'd have to say I&nbsp;like it. The service has been prompt, the providers very professional, and the paperwork minimal.&nbsp;
Lets see.. what else has been going on. Oh, I&nbsp;sold my first commissioned art here this past week. It was a personal piece for a coworker of Nadine's. I'll post an image at a later date, it's a surprise gift and I don't want to accidentally spill the beans. (doubtful the people involved would read this or see my F.B., but you never know). 
As for food and drink, I've been very happy there as well. Mama Janzon (Nadine's mother, with whom we live) has quite a nice garden going, so we're treated to lots of fresh fruits and veggies. Have had lots of fresh zucchini, radishes, lettuce, beans, onions, kohlrabi, currant, strawberries, peppers, apples, etc, etc. Other favorite foods I've been enjoying; muesli (breakfast cereal) , spaezle (flour noodles, often baked with onions and cheese),&nbsp; erdnuss flips (little puffed snack things, made with peanuts, they're delicious), Bratwurst (in many different varieties), Spezi (a soda that is a mix of orange and cola flavors, and is quite popular here), rum coconut chocolate ball candies (with real rum inside), Doener (a Turkish import, but one of the most popular fast-food items here, they're oh so good), Bienenstich cake (om nom nom nom nom).. etc. Also love the fresh breads from the local bakeries.
More recently I've been cutting back on my meat and dairy consumption, for environmental, ethical, and health reasons. I'm not real hard-core about it, but have been sampling a lot of vegan foods and soy alternatives, things like that. There is a decent amount of such products in the store, but some of them do tend to run slightly higher in price. 
It's getting pretty late and we're heading out early in the morning for the Zoo (forgot to mention, Nadine is on vacation all this week, which is very nice), so I'll close this out for now. Sure I'll think of more things to update with soon. (planning to do a bunch on some cultural differences and such, for those who plan to visit here someday (wink))
Hope everyone is doing well, 
Take care of each other.
~Peace!"

"event","Glad I'm not planning on air travel again soon, the trip over here was full of frustration and fail, but I suppose it all worked out in the end more or less. I&nbsp;am here after all, and beginning the daily life in Germany with the wife. :)<br /><br />I&nbsp;got the tickets online through Travelocity, no problems there. Got a pretty good rate and no complications.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems started at the airport. The check-in area for American Airlines at DFW was a complete mess. I checked in at the automated station and payed $60 for my first additional checked bag at that terminal. The terminal only allowed for registering that one additional checked bag. After doing that check in, I&nbsp;went and stood in what I&nbsp;hoped was the right place to stand, waiting to physically check all my baggage. The digital signs/screens over the various counters were completely unhelpful and uninformative. After waiting there with a crowd of maybe 50 people for a good 40 minutes, I&nbsp;discovered I&nbsp;was indeed in the right place. This was not a line people were standing in, but sort of a corral with people just kind of milling about and looking confused. The service people at the counter were then shouting the names of whoever they were serving, and the named person would come up and check their bags. That is, if the person guessed correctly about where they should go after the electronic kiosk. Fortunately, I&nbsp;got that part right. So they called my name and I&nbsp;went up to the counter with my cart full of bags. I&nbsp;informed them that I&nbsp;had 3 additional checked bags to pay for and have checked. The lady at the desk told me it would cost me $450 to check those 3 bags. I&nbsp;was flabbergasted. All information on the American Airlines website points to a pay structure like this for international flights: the first checked bag is free, additional checked bags cost $60. Any overweight or oversized bags carry additional fees. What they failed to make clear in the website is that only the second checked bag is $60. Every bag after that costs $150 each to check. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So here I&nbsp;am standing at the baggage check with more bags than I&nbsp;can afford to check. Don't have enough cash on hand to cover the whole fee, don't have enough in the bank to cover the whole fee, but maybe if I&nbsp;combine cash and check card I&nbsp;can make it happen. Unfortunately the woman behind the counter is completely dumbfounded by the idea of using more than one form of payment on a transaction, and is also unwilling to figure out how to do it. After she messes around with the computer for a while, I tell her nevermind, I'll check just 2 additional bags and pay the $300 for that in cash. So I pay that and am left with 1 un-checked suitcase, my transportation to the airport has already left, I&nbsp;don't have a usable cell phone to call for help and kind of run in to panic mode.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I formulate a quick hopeful plan in my head, to call up John who gave me a ride to the airport, ask him to come back by the place and pick up my extra bag I&nbsp;can't afford to check. I&nbsp;have no idea how far he has driven away by this time, could be halfway back to Austin for all I&nbsp;know. So I search my bag for his phone number, can't find the paper I&nbsp;wrote it down on. Crap. Instead I use my Germany based T-mobile phone to try to call mom, so she can call john, and relay my predicament. Cell phone doesn't work for crap, she can't hear what I'm saying. So I run to the pay phone, don't have enough change to make a payphone call. Crap. So I&nbsp;try the debit card in the payphone, and it works. Finally a small victory. I&nbsp;get ahold of mom, ask her to relay the situation to John and beg him to come get my extra suitcase. Get off the phone and wait a few minutes, then call her back again and everything is good to go. John is headed back to the airport to pick up my suitcase. Big ups to the payphone peoples for putting debit card readers on the phones, and many thanks to John for making the detour to help me out.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The one suitcase I've chosen not to check has in it only my desktop computer and some blankets &amp;&nbsp;pillows for padding. I'm still not sure how to work out getting the machine over here now, but it seemed the only logical choice at the time. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; John comes by and picks up the suitcase, I&nbsp;run in and do the security screening, no problems there. I&nbsp;arrive at the gate and the people at the counter are working frantically, rearranging the seating plans for the flight. I&nbsp;don't know if the cause was over-booking or some people maybe had earlier flights canceled and were still trying to find spots or what, but it was pretty chaotic at the gate. I was called up and had my seat changed a couple of times, which was fine. At this point I&nbsp;don't really care where I&nbsp;sit, as long as I get on the damn plane and have a successful flight.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally we board the plane, considerably later than scheduled. Then I&nbsp;discover that the plane we're on is a Boeing 767, which appears to be one of the lot produced in the early 80's. The ashtrays in the armrests have been welded shut, and they have placed updated flat screens at the forward end of each cabin, but otherwise the interior is almost completely unchanged. The interior paneling and the window panes show their age considerably. They are much abused, warped, and cracked from the many years the plane has been in service. There are essentially no comfort considerations. It doesn't even have the little air blowers above each passenger for a bit of personal temperature control. Having worked on airframes before, it made me somewhat uncomfortable looking out over the wing and seeing very visible wear &amp;&nbsp;tear on the exterior. The dents, material damages, and paint cracks made me want to go out and do maintenance checks on the airframe rivets myself. If I&nbsp;were running the airline, there is essentially no way this plane would still be in service. That being said, I'm sure the aircraft is regularly inspected and maintained by law, so I put my misgivings aside and settled in for the flight. <br />&nbsp; The flight was okay, the crew were very professional and friendly. The pilot seemed to have a bit of a mumbling problem. It was nearly impossible to make out what he said over the intercom, though he was speaking English. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; After arriving in the Frankfurt airport, I&nbsp;went first through the Passport control station. They were well staffed and friendly, had no problems there. Then it was off to the baggage claim. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; There I&nbsp;discovered that my bags were thoroughly abused. One duffel was ripped on the the end, though only a small hole. Another had the zipper open, though it didn't appear that much had fallen out. My large green army duffel bag, however, was on the baggage claim completely open. The steel clasp at the top had been twisted out of shape, and a bunch of my stuff was strewn all along the baggage claim. Being exhausted and already severely annoyed, this was extremely frustrating. I&nbsp;collected all the belongings of mine that I could find laying on the belt, though I&nbsp;really don't know if everything was there, or if some things are lost forever. I&nbsp;was already pretty tired when packing, so I couldn't remember precisely what was in which bag. I&nbsp;shrugged it off as best I&nbsp;could and gathered all my bags. Then I&nbsp;discovered that the luggage carts cost 2 euro each to rent. I&nbsp;had 1 euro and some change, not enough to rent a cart, and four large bags to move. So I&nbsp;tried my debit card in the cart corral machine, didn't work. Crap. Stood around looking dazed and confused for a bit, hoping someone might pass by that I&nbsp;could beg a euro from. (Money exchanges are located after the baggage claim and customs, kind of silly). Eventually tried out the debit card on the machine again, and this time it worked. Woot! So I&nbsp;got a cart, and loaded up the bags.<br />&nbsp; Discovered later when unpacking that TSA had rifled through each and every one of my bags. (they leave a little note in there informing you they've gone through it). They opened all boxes and then re-taped them closed (Tape with TSA logo on it). Left all the stuff generally tossed-through when they put it back in the bags. For the bag that was left open I don't know what happened. Either TSA wrenched it open with a tool of some sort, then failed to close it properly, or it perhaps snagged somewhere in the machinery of bag transporting. While I've never had one of those heavy steel clasps get bent &amp; opened by the transport machinery, I would have to leave it open as a possibility. Either way, it pissed me right the hell off to arrive at the baggage claim and see my stuff thrown about all over the place. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I coasted through customs (there was actually no one at customs, so I&nbsp;just walked right through), and found my wonderful wife on the other side. Good thing she was there to meet me and hug me and calm me down. The whole travel experience was making me want to <strong>RAGE</strong>.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All's well that ends well I&nbsp;suppose. Now I'm pretty well settled down here in Deutschland, the trials and tribulations of the journey are fading. Not planning on flying anywhere again really soon though, that's for sure. ;-)"

I'm not a great communicator in spoken conversation sometimes. Especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Some things are too emotional for me to express well in speech &amp; the blank page just works better.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure most everyone who knows me is aware that I am currently unwillingly separated from my wife. She's living in Germany and I'm here in Texas. I don't know if I could find the right words to express the heart-crushing pain this causes for me, and for her as well. It's kind of like being half zombie; alive and dead all at once, but still being conscious enough to feel yourself falling apart.&nbsp; Every day, every hour, all the time. It has been this way for too long. I love my wife and I don't want to lose her. I don't want what we have together to continue being damaged by the distance. So what's to be done?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be moving to Germany. Some in the family have suggested it, or wondered why I didn't go already. Some may be surprised. Hopefully everyone will be able to understand that its just part of who I am. I have to do what I feel is the right thing. Its kind of like when&nbsp;I joined the army, I am aware that it may be difficult for some of my loved ones, but I&nbsp;feel its the right thing to do. I don't know how it will all work out. I don't know exactly what I'll do when I'm there. I don't know a lot of things. But I do know that I&nbsp;feel its the right thing for me to do. What more can I do in this crazy mixed-up world than try to do what I feel is right? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It will certainly be an awfully big adventure. I do already speak some German, though not as much as I would like, and not enough really to make passable conversation. So I'll be working on that some as I go forward. Also, I have a lot of stuff. Some of it I will be mailing and some of it I will be selling or giving away, or tossing if it's just junk. I will be selling my car for certain, looking for $3000 or so. I don't have a date yet for when I will be leaving. I'll be sure to let people know once I have that pinned down. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So.. kind of short and to the point. As well as I could anyway. Feel free to let me know what you think. Good, bad, or indifferent. <br /><br />~B</div>"

"event","But aren't we all?

A few days before Christmas, I was out shopping for the last-minute gifts. The store was pretty busy and the parking lot was moderately full. Not really packed, just busy. 
As I was walking out of the store someone driving by the entrance decided to follow me to my car. It was probably a good 150 feet away from the entrance. Not a great parking spot by any measure. Once I noticed the car was following me at my pace, I slowed my walking a bit just to be sure. They continued to follow, practically idling to avoid overtaking me. As I arrived at my car and got in, the other car stopped and waited. Now, I may be strange in this, but it gets on my nerves a bit when people do this. They easily could have driven at normal speed, parked, and been on their happy little way into the store on foot by now. Would they maybe have had to park 20 feet further out? Sure. Does it mean anything to me if they have the spot after I've left? Not at all. However, substantially slowing down the entire flow of traffic through the lot, and pissing off other drivers who just want to get through the lot, just to gain that spot 20 feet closer is a jerky move. Not a big deal, but enough to make me feel like returning the favor. 
So I got in my car and sat there. Didn't start it up or go anywhere. The driver of the other car who had followed me waited. And waited. And waited. 
Finally about 5 minutes into this standoff, the other cars behind the waiter start going crazy, honking, flashing their lights, etc. So the driver sees the failure of his plan, and moves on. Maybe a bit wiser, maybe not, but very likely annoyed. 
I, however, am amused. I don't usually find mirth in being annoying to others. I usually go out of my way to be unobtrusive. It's a pet-peeve of mine when people pull this move though, so I have fun with it. 
I am a jerk sometimes, but aren't we all?"

If someone has a bad credit score, because they are unemployed, and they can't pay.. oh I don't know.. emergency hospital bills, then they will need something to rectify that situation. Something to fix their debt. Something to get their credit rating in the right place again.
That something is, a job.

"event","Back again.. again.
Changed the color theme. I don't know that my journal itself ever had a theme, so that's not really changing. I do think I need to write. Need being the key word. I've been somewhat mentally stagnating. Haven't been able to feel much creativity or inspiration. Haven't been able to communicate well. Have to force myself when it comes to these things because somewhere in my subconscious is an antisocial complex. Its a kind of environmentally driven thing. If I'm in an environment where social connections are readily available and easy, I can be a very social person. If I'm in an environment where there isn't much social connection available, I can shut off and completely internalize myself. The problem is that the ""shutting off"" is the stronger of the two tendencies. Even in easily social situations I will shut off. Anyway, I have a much longer self-analysis.. 'essay' (I guess) in the works. So I won't go much further into it now. 
The point of this rambling really is, this is my personality. I know its hard to deal with and I don't blame anyone for holding a grudge with me for my antisocial behavior. 
Trying to get back to writing often. I plan to try to write daily. It will be current social/political thoughts, memories from my life, fiction, poetry, whatever comes to mind. Also, as I'm trying to learn more German, I will be attempting to translate some of my entries. (this will most likely be a laugh for my wife). 
I'm sure I have too far alienated many friends, but for anyone still reading, I'm back again.. again. :)"

as of monday i was the strong one. i had everything together, and nothing was going completely wrong...

Then:
i failed
dropped my grade
didnt get a dress
cried
got sick
cried more
got sicker
felt stupid
felt betrayed(old feeling surfacing)
realized that i am still alone after almost a year
realized that i am not going to be with someone again for a long time and that i am undesirable

Now:
still sick
saw my mom, grandparents, cousin (they made me feel better)
spring break is right around the corner
going to hang out with people no matter what. NO MATTER WHAT. esp Weiner #1, Meener, and Noel.

"event","tonight was pretty good.


i had a bit of a breakdown with my dad, but then i went to santa sues alice and wonderland play (which was hilarious) then to carl's jr with kaity and katy mac and we made fun of all the 12 year olds being retarded over there.

so on the way home we drove by&nbsp; kyle's house, so i called meaghann and told her to come outside where she informed me that Ethan (ironically my cousin's nephew, which we found out one day a long time ago when kyle's mom was babysitting) was there, so i went inside to say hi to him, and kyle's mom and all that jazz...it was good, i havent been there in awhile, they got a new coffee table. 

i would say that today was a good day. 

i hope that vchb went well for everyone. and i missed all of you on thursday."

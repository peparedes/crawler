"event","heylo everyone,

Just got home from work and i had a good night. I spent the day with Ben and Jan. Jan showed me how to paint sereamics. *It was at the flea market*. I think that i will hang with them out there for often, because what Jan does is so cool. it's a very good hoppy. *Mesa like it alot ^.^* It also gives me a chance to be with Ben. After all at this point in time in my life I am so glad i have someone like him. 

Then i went home and took a nap. Then i went to work and hung out with Lesli and Jackie. They are pretty cool. i really like them. but god i do not like my boss sam. He yells at me for the dumbest things and it pisses me off. I am thinking about getting a new job because he really pisses me off there.

But oh well that is my story in a day in the life. 

Das ve Danya

instead it was torcher... i wish things were not this bad at home. i wish i didn't have to feel pain and anguish al the time every waking min of my life. i want to be happy once for the hole day. a day i know i would never forget. but i might as well keep dreaming nothing goes as i hope for and neither for mom. oh well though. one day i will find a place where nothing will go wrong and everyone would be happy and everyone could laugh and do whatever they want without hurting everyone else. anyway i hope that i can find it one day even if it isn't in this world. bye they way if ben ever reads this i want to let him know he is always and forever  in my heart. i love him and always will. i just want him to know that well good bye lj."

well i guess today i have to work although i don't feel like  going i must if i don't want fired. anyway i went to bettys last night. its was fun another night of learning. lol anyway *yawn* im tired. fourth hour is so boring im sitting here with joanna pondering the mysteries of life while she stares at her book of doom. and lauren was talking at the wall today yet again. she is a sweet girl when she wants to be anyway. she told me that roin busted her hand and i hope she is ok. more of my family is dieing yet agian. its hurts to lose someone but lately im so use to seeing someone die in my family that i don't get upset anymore. i mean i know that sounds mean  but i will always love and pray for them. because they where always there for me. im also hoping to get my room changed around with some new furniture. my room is going to be based on moons and stars with chines and japaniess symbols. along with lepaord stuff and things like that. i figure that its best to tell my thoughts here on lj but as for my family my god keep them all safe because soon  wont be here anymore. i will move far away because me and this town bounce energy off each other and i figure that if i can get out of this state or just to a diffrent town then things would be better and i wont feel annoyed all the time. im serious when someone says something to me i just want to hit them and i can't figure out why? well anyway that is just my thought. but i hope i will get over it soon before i feel this way again."

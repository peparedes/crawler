"event","I am posting this to Dreamwidth and echoing it to LJ because neither of us can comment on Blaise's LJ post. We both get errors. Congratulations, LJ, you broke the system. Happy now?? Stop trying to be just like the Faceborg and Galling+!!

Anyway, <b>update</b>: Blaise no longer knows how long it will take to get the server up again. What should have taken the hosting company no more than 4 hours has now taken 3 days and counting. Once the system is stable, it shouldn't take Blaise more than 8 hours to restore configurations and data. He's hoping by noon tomorrow, but, of course, can't guarantee that. He apologizes for the inconvenience. 

Feel free to pass this on to anyone else who might not see it elsewhere.

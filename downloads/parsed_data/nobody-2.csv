"event","<p>Not much to say on college, except for it's extremely draining.<br /><br />History<br />My first class made me really nervous, then I saw Abby Greenwell. All I can ever think when I see her, is how I stole her bike (A story I should relay sometime) So that totally took my mind off the nerves. We talked for a bit until the teacher wallked in.<br /><br />Mr. Stone is a total Jew, but he's really nice.<br /><br />Geology&nbsp;<br />This class comes with a pair of<strong> 3D</strong> glasses and <strong>3D</strong> images that aren't that <strong>3D<br /></strong><br />Psychology<br />&nbsp;The teacher is really tall. I met Sonya from highschool there. We've had about 4 classes togethe in that spanr but have never really talked until a couple days ago.<br /><br />AND THEN LIEK<br /><br />When I entered drama class, I was expecting a flow of Theater faggots that wear those&nbsp;""News boy"" hats that I hate with utter passion who listen to indie music because it's indie, but really, all I got was a bunch of ""I must comment eurrything the teacher says with something witty in hopes to drain a laugh out of&nbsp; class"" douche bags that wear baseball caps ~BACKWARDS~<br /><br /><br /><br />I worked with bitchy mc bitch bitch today, I'm totally re-naming her Stally, mc stall stall. since that's all she did today.&nbsp;<br />FUCKING 3 BREAKS!?</p>"

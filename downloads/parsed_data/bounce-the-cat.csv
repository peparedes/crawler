Have you ever had Jamba Juice?
Had the what?

If you know me you will appreciate the irony... I tried to get girls to confess their sins to me and accept the penance I'd give them >:)  The year before that I was a Necromancer, and I would have won the party's prize for scariest costume... if it hadn't been for Dave dressing up as Paris Hilton...

Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Grand Admiral Thrawn... the guy was a military genius, and he would have pulled it off, if it hadn't been for those pesky kids... Mara Jade is pretty damn cool too. Of characters from the 2 1/2 real movies, Han Solo, from the 3 1/2 fake/bad ones again Han Solo (2nd half of Jedi) or Mace Windu

If I think they will call yeah, if I don't really expect a call then no

What books, if any, have made you cry?
Nothing lately, but when I was younger I had a very strong emotional reaction to Uncle Tom's Cabin and a vampire novel called Vampire of the Mists.

Do you think you're attractive?
I shall leave that to others to decide

What are you allergic to?
Bullshit

Are you a jealous person?
I can be possessive/jealous, but not insanely so. I am not the controlling type, I just don't like being ignored in favor of somebody else if I am the one with the girl

What's your opinion on sex without emotional commitment?
Not really my thing... I need to have some emotional bond to the person (not necessary love, but at least mutual caring and respect) I have had friends with benefits, but the focus there is on the friend, not the benefits

"event","I know I haven't written in ages. But we've been really busy and a lot has gone on in our little lives. 

First of all, Daddy graduated from this college thing he kept going off to. *Drumroll and applause please* He finished his thesis thing and defended it in December, after spending a lot of time working on it instead of playing with me.

After that he spent a lot of time at home, since he could no longer work at nights and had to find a 'real job' as he called it. He did find one of those, which led to important news #3:

We moved halfway across the country. We are now living in a place called 'Delaware' and Daddy drives to a city called 'Phillydelphia' every day. He's gone for a long time, but he seems happy about it. He is working for a company called Dancing Ferret Discs. Strange name. The ferrets I met never danced, they kinda just hobbled along and fell off places. But oh well, maybe the ferrets in Phillydelphia actually dance on discs...

Instead of our nice apartment we now live in a nice house, where daddy is renting a room. The house belongs to a nice lady, who sometimes scolds me, but is otherwise pretty cool. Daddy and her get along really well. She has a cat named Kona, and her and I have had our differences. All I want is to play tag while she's sleeping, and she doesn't always like that... but we get along much better now. 

The trip down to Delaware was not nice though... I don't like the car, and this time Daddy did not put me in the carrier. He said something about not wanting me to be cooped up for ten hours. The night before the sneaky bastard actually tried to put something into my water, but smart cat as I am, I didn't touch it. But I was so scared on the drive that Daddy said I started to breathe all funny. So he stopped over and we visited the vet. She was nice, but after she petted me for a bit she poked me with a needle. Why does she keep doing that? Anyhow, I got really tired and I slept most of the way to Delaware. I think Daddy was happy about that too. Though he kept calling me sneakycat again, because I looked for a nice dark place to sleep in and he couldn't find me for a few minutes.

Daddy really likes Phillydelphia and Delaware. He keeps saying that we lived in a cultural wasteland in Michigan. Nice people, but nothing much to do. Here he has a lot to do for work, but he has a great time. Last night he met a woman called Kristanna Loken, who apparently is some sort of movie star. And he hung out with Steven and Donna from Ego Likeness and Voltaire. He came home really late, but he must have enjoyed himself. And every Wednesday he goes to something called Nocturne, which seems a lot of fun as well. I'd love to go with him sometime, but I know I'd have to ride in the car, and I don't want that.

Anyhow, we will try to post more often in the future, but oh well, I'm a cat, easily distracted by oooh... shiny....

Quick edit... for those of you not yet aware of the natural superiority of cats, take a look at www.rathergood.com/laibach ... you will see why you should give us all the tuna we want... or else"

<ol>
<li><b> bergkamen</b>:<br>The city I grew up in. I'm still not sure if I like it or not :P It has it's good points, mostly family and friends, and it's got its bad sides, mostly the people that are NOT family and friends :P</li><li><b> cats</b>:<br>If they wanted to, they could rule the world. They already rule the cat owners. Bounce graciously allows me to maintain the illusion of free will, so I feel a little better about myself. But I'm his slave, and we both know it.</li><li><b> dortmund</b>:<br>Biggest city close to home. Very good place to go shopping, bad place to go clubbing. Some very nice small places to eat, like the Cash Cafe or the Cafe Chat Noir. Avoid the Alex or the Extrablatt, you will get fuckin ripped off.</li><li><b> goth</b>:<br>I'm a goth. I'm also a gamer, a punk, a metalhead, and half a dozen other little boxes you could put me in (after you break me down to fit me) I like the subculture, I like the music, I like the clothing. I am too happy and upbeat to be a deep and depressive Uber-Goth, but those people basically only exist in the mind of mundanes anyhow :P</li><li><b> michigan state university</b>:<br>My alma mater. And also the place I'm still studying at. Been here for six years, and I have seen the administration and the city council of East Lansing grow worse with every year. I have never seen a place so openly hostile to students.</li><li><b> nrw</b>:<br>Northrhine-Westphalia, one of the larger German states, and the one that Bergkamen and Dortmund are located in. Not really an interest of mine, I just put it on there to be able to search for chicks from tha area *evil laugh*... no serious, I put it on there because I wanted a few more interests listed... nothing special there.</li><li><b> rats</b>:<br>Love 'em. Sweet, cuddly, smart, friendly... I only wish they lived longer than two or three years. My first rat, Tink, was the sweetest rat you'd ever meet. She jumped up and down in her cage when I came in, and reached through the bars to grab my attention... I miss her *sniff*</li><li><b> role playing</b>:<br>Yes, I'm a D&D nerd. There, I admit it. I love it. It's a way to relax, to hang out with friends, and to really stick it to the enemy, i.e. the game master. I am a munchkin/power-gamer/twink, and though I am not nearly as bad as some other people I know, I am pretty bad. But I'm working on it... if only the game designers didn't make it so damn easy to twink out :P</li><li><b> talking about movies</b>:<br>Yes, I can talk movies for hours. I'm a fount of useless trivia and pointless information. By the way, one of my fave little references in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (will be out this friday) is the manufacturer of the piano... you'll get it when you see it... you better :P</li><li><b> the ramones</b>:<br>One of the greatest bands there was. I remember the year Joey died, happened a few months after I broke up with a girl that had been lying to me for almost a year. I didn't cry when I told her it was over, even though she tried her best to make me feel like crap... I cried when I heard that Joey died :(</li>

"event","Today Daddy went to Ren Faire in Holly. He usually has a great time, and though he and his friends left late today, he still got to see a lot of nice things. He drooled over a pair of tooled leather greaves at Pyramid, but he didn't have the money, so he has to wait until next year :(

He actually met a few nice people at one of the booths, and hung out with them for quite a while. Either he is not as repulsive and anti-social as he believed he was (that's what he'd like to think) or they took pity on the pathetic little creature he is (that's what I think *smirk*)

He keeps cleaning the place, yesterday he scared the living shit out of me with a noise-maker from hell. On the other hand, when he was done the floor was all clean and nice and soft under my paws. So I guess it's a trade-off. I just hope he won't do it again anytime soon. But knowing my luck he'll do it tommorow.

Right now he's at work, so I will take a nap on his clean shirts, or maybe his underwear, so it's all marked as MINE when he comes home. Aren't I just too sweet, letting him know exactly what to expect? Maybe I'll even find some tuna in the magic cupboard. He bought a new can-opener after I accidentally broke the old one (he doesn't know it was me, he is still wondering why it broke) but I think it's a feline-unfriendly one as well... Why can't they make a can-opener that cats can use?"

"event","Daddy has been gone all day. Apparently his work shifts changed, so he now works Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Since he has class all day on Mondays that means he leaves early in the morning and doesn't come back until Tuesday morning. I hate that. Maybe in the future he will come home after his last class, rather than waste his time in the stupid computer labs. He has to play with me and make me feel loved and wanted, or I will be upset. And when the Bounce is upset, PEOPLE DIE!!!

Anyhow, I know he is getting really excited because Chris and Steffi will be here in a week. He is slightly stressed about getting the place cleaned up, since Sara never got her shit together to get her shit out of there. He will probably just dump it all. She has made it abundantly clear that she does not want it anymore. Interesting how fast passionate love can turn into apparent indifference. A little scary even.

Anyhow, there is not much going on here as usual. My life is very simple. I wake up. I pester daddy. I eat. I pester daddy. I miss daddy while he's gone. I sleep. Being a cat RULES!"

"event","Daddy has come home about two weeks ago, and picked me up two days after he got home. It was great seeing the big guy again, even though I'll miss my little playmate at Chris and Summer's place. They got a baby kitten a few weeks before I left. Oh well, I am back with daddy now, and I am happy.

Unfortunately Tink crossed the Rainbow Bridge a few weeks ago, but the other rats have grown huge. I know that I would not mess with them now, if they were out of their cage. But they don't come out, I don't go in there, and we all are cool *smirks*

Daddy is trying to get his apartment taken care of, since two of his friends are coming to visit in three weeks. He tried to contact Sara about it, hopefully they can get her stuff out within the next two weeks. He is really looking forward to that visit, and I am curious to see the people that Daddy hangs out with in his cat-free time.

Oh well, gotta go raid the magic cupboard... there's GOT to be tuna here somewhere..."

"event","1. Do NOT lock your tent with cheap-ass combination locks that fuck you over when you try to open them :(

2. Security guards with multi-functional tools (i.e. Leatherman) are great people to find if you want to get back into your tent after midnight... they are also fucking hard people to find after midnight

3. The only person who is an even greater friend than the security guard with the leatherman, is the security guard with the firehose...

4. Water smells FUCKING AWESOME!!!

5. If the lines in front of the real toilets are half a mile long, you can always try the stinky yucky dixies... they will be lonely and unwanted...

6. If you buy CDs by obscure bands that are not well-known, remember your spelling... or you might end up with Susperia, rather than Suspiria.

7. Whoever invented sunscreen lotion deserves a 300 foot statue made from pure gold in his honor. But nowhere too hot, so it won't melt... like ice in the sunshine, like ice in the sunshine... errr... okay, nevermind :P

8. Just because there are people walking by your tent and having loud conversations about showers and sleeping late, does NOT mean it is later than 4.30 am.

9. A maglite and a leatherman are NOT useful when they are INSIDE your locked tent, and you are OUTSIDE your locked tent.

10. Since people ALWAYS trip over your tent lines and make your tent collapse on your poor sleeping body, and then drag the lines away without noticing, it is always good to bring extra string... lots of it."

"event","Until Daddy comes back to Michigan. I think it is high time. I miss the big klutz... And I know he really misses me too.

But I think he is really looking forward to his freedom again. While he really loves his family, it is getting too much for him. They love to spend HIS time. It is not even that, which bugs him. Sure he is willing to help out. Sure he doesn't mind the lawn. But what pisses him off royally is that they don't even ASK him anymore. It is more like 'Saturday we'll work on removing those beams and lay down the rest of the floorboards' or 'If the weather is good at three, you can go and mow the lawn' Stuff like that brings daddy's blood to the boiling point. But since he is a nice and gentle person he doesn't do what he feels like doing, and tells them all to go to hell.

Monday he'll start a summer job for four weeks. His mom doesn't like him sitting around all day doing nothing. Well, it was not HIS idea to come over for four months. He had to have his visa renewed, which used to take eight weeks minimum... and took two this time. Otherwise he would either have stayed in Michigan longer, or returned to Michigan sooner. And next summer he's probably going to go over for only eight weeks... this way he can enjoy the Michigan summer, work his night job, and cuddle me.

I think having this job will help daddy get his mind off the kitten-shaped hole in his life, his lack of feline companionship that he is going through at the moment. And having a little extra money sure won't hurt... though it is doubtful how much of that money he will get as actual spending money... it is more likely that his parents will tell him 'You can use this for gas and food, this way we don't have to help you out for a month or two' In some certain key areas daddy knows exactly what to expect from his people...

Anyhow, he was really happy last week, when he got to go to that concert of his. Apparently the show was awesome as always, and he can't wait to see them again this sunday. I hope he'll have a great time, he is taking two of his friends to see the Cruxshadows for the first time ever... and hopes that they will be just as hooked as he is...

*Purrs softly* I know that he hopes that I will even remember him when he gets back, and that I am not mad at him for leaving me for this long. Four months is a LONG time for a little kitten... well, I won't forget him, but I am still a little miffed about being left alone for so long... we will see if I can forgive him *smirks*"

"event","He was supposed to go on his motorbike tour yesterday, but because of the weather that did not happen. He rode for a few hours today, but it is not the same really...

Then he found out that his favourite band is playing a major music festival next weekend. But he did not get a ticket for it, because there is another one a few weeks later with more bands that he likes, so he decided to go to that one instead. Plus the one next weekend is at a place called the Lorelei, where he was supposed to go on his bike tour this weekend, which is another reason he decided not to go there, because he would have been gone there already... now he's not going there at all, and he can't see that band... Oh well, he's gonna see them three days earlier, and a week later, so it should be okay... but it is annoying nonetheless...

Two days ago Daddy went to his old high school, to visit his old english teacher's classes. He does this every year, to tell kids about life in the states, going to college, living thousands of miles away from home. Sometimes they seem interested, but Daddy has noticed that they get more and more indifferent every year. He feels old, mostly because he cannot relate to their mindset. To him Johnny Knoxville is not a hero and totally funny guy, but pretty much a sad, sad person, the kind of kid that eats bugs in school to get attention, grown into a man. And a show like the Osbournes is not really that cool to Daddy either, because to him Ozzy should be the poster child for a new drug-awareness campaign 'Do you want to become this when you are 50... don't do drugs!' Don't get me wrong, Ozzy wrote some great songs, is an awesome singer, and deserves a lot of credit. He is probably a great person as well. But should he be a role model to 14 year olds, who see him stagger around his house in a confused daze, hardly ever noticing what the fuck is going on around him? Daddy feels a little weird ranting about role models for kids and stuff like that. Some of the people he really likes are not exactly model citizens either. And if he dressed up to go clubbing (REALLY dressed up, rather than the stuff he wears normally) he would not be let into the one dinky little place his hometown in Germany has... then again, he would not go to that place anyhow, because it caters to a crowd he couldn't be part of if he tried (or wanted to)

All in all daddy feels tired, burnt out, old, depressed, and a little bit lonely. I wish I was there to cheer him up, and I know the rat-pack would help too, but we are too far away. And I have a feeling that daddy needs not only feline, but maybe also some female companionship... but I might be wrong about that :P"

In October two of daddy's friends from Germany are thinking of visiting, and he is very happy about that. Apparently he told them of me, and they want to come and worship at the Altar of Bounce. They are welcome, if they bring the gift of Tuna... if not they will wake up with a furry facemask every night *Evil kitten-grin*

But he gets to do a lot of things that take his mind off of missing me. I know that he has seen both Troy and Day After Tommorow two times each, and that he went shopping for CDs recently. Why can't I go shop for CDs? Oh right... I have no job. I have no money. I steal Daddy's CDs and listen to them when he's at work or in class.

He once again bought CDs on impulse. Just because he heard of a band in a movie he likes and heard a few seconds of music, he goes out and buys their albums... how foolish can you be? Anyhow, he got lucky with the Beta Band a few weeks ago, and now he apparently got lucky again when he bought an album by Stiff Little Fingers... and he is currently waiting for the new Nightwish album, the two new Cruxshadows CDs, and the new album by Bella Morte... He doesn't think that he can get a CD by Kinky there, but he will try...

Anyhow, enough of the music talk, let's talk the important stuff... let's talk TUNA! Apparently in Germany you can get tuna on pizza. And I have to stay here... anyhow, daddy doesn't like tuna (blasphemer) and therefore would never order it on a pizza here, even if it was offered... but imagine... a place where tuna and pizza go together hand in hand... *drools slightly*"

A little over two weeks ago he had to go back to Germany to be with his family over the summer, and to extend something he calls his visa... Apparently he needs it to stay here with me. But if he needs it to stay with me, he should not have to go to Germany to get my permission... I want him to stay here.

Anyhow, he brought me to friends of his, and I have stayed there ever since. I miss daddy, and I know that daddy misses me as well. I hope I get to see him soon, he said that he would be back in August. I hope that's soon.

Of course, being the Bounce-Kitten I know what he is doing in Germany, so I will know if he falls for another cat... if he does, I will rearrange the skin on his face when he comes back... but I know that he never would, so he doesn't have to worry... much *smirk*

Tonight daddy was at the birthday party for his granny. She turned 70. That's like 10 in cat years. Daddy's birthday was earlier this month, before he left. But he didn't celebrate much. Anyhow, I don't know how much fun daddy had. There was nobody to talk to under the age of 60 or so, besides a few family members, and the music was too loud to talk. And since it was German folk music, which daddy hates with a purple passion, I don't think he enjoyed the music either. I think he much rather would have been at the WGT in Leipzig, hanging out with hundreds of younger people, seeing some really great bands. But I know that he loves his family, so he stayed home and went to his granny's party.

Other than missing me, daddy seems not to mind Germany too much. The food is okay (but too much, he has gained almost ten pounds in two weeks) and he can hang out with friends from his younger days. And he is planning on going to M'Era Luna festival in August, a few weeks before he's coming home. He went last year and loved it, and if he goes this year he will get another nice little band around his wrist that I can play with when he comes home. I am sure that's why he goes to those shows, to get wristbands for me to play with.

Oh well, it is quite depressing to write about daddy while he's not around to pet me or feed me tuna. I can't even bug him by climbing on the rat cage, because the rats are with other friends of his. Oh well, time to see if Summer will feed me some tuna if I meow loud enough..."

"event","since my last update, but I don't think anybody really minded, right? After all, I am a cute cuddly kitten so you HAVE to forgive me anything I do, right? Right.

Anyhow, here's what happened in mine and daddy's life lately.

Daddy went to see one of his favourite bands, Rasputina, not just once but two times. Last Saturday at a place called 'The Intersection' in Grand Rapids, and again on Wednesday at the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor. Both shows were great he says, but he got really mad at the guys at the Intersection, because they scheduled another event after the Rasputina show, so their set was cut short and everybody had to leave. That just isn't nice, it really made him mad at the place and I don't think he will go there again unless it is a really really really special occasion. The concert at the Blind Pig was more fun he says, because he got to meet the band after the show and get their autographs and talk to them for a bit.

Sunday night daddy was not feeling well at all, he had a really bad tummy-ache and was worried that he had a kidney stone again. He had one last year (before I was even born) and he says the pain was excruciating. I don't know what that word means, excruciating, but it doesn't sound nice. So Monday morning daddy decided to drive himself into the ER, to make sure that he didn't have a kidney stone. It turned out to be false alarm, daddy's kidneys are not stoned. In fact, he says that the moment he stepped into the ER, he felt fine, but then decided to go through with it anyhow, just to be on the safe side. I am glad that daddy is doing okay, I don't like for him to be in pain.

Other than that there is nothing much exciting going on lately. He works, he sleeps, he studies, he watches some movies, and he plays video games. Some of these things he does more than others, he still is trying to figure out a healthy balance. He is glad that the semester is almost over, and wondering where the hell the four months went. It seems to him that time is passing without him even noticing, and he has nothing to show for it.

Oh well. He will learn to cope..."

He came back in an awesome mood, even though I think I could hear his knee joints creak and his legs looked very shaky. Apparently he has been dancing all night (which is a rare occasion) and he wasn't even drunk. He must have had a great time.

He told me about the place, and it seems to kick ass. It even has it's own sushi bar... errrr... pond with fish. Of course he couldn't get his ass out of bed until almost 5 today, but that's okay, it's not like he had anything major to do.

Anyhow, it's been a while in between updated, but that's a cat's life for you. I eat, I sleep, I look cute. And I am good at what I do :P"

He is thrilled, I am jealous, because I never get to go to cool concerts. Anyhow, he's currently wondering what to wear. Black leather pants of course, combat boots most likely, and he wishes he had a black fishnet shirt, but he doesn't, so it will most likely be a band shirt, unless he decides to raid Hot Topic before the show, which he might do. He is also pondering whether to wear his pieces of leather armor (shoulder and arms) for the show or not. It looks kick-ass, but he is worried that he might look a little foolish. The vambraces are a must of course, but the shoulder pieces might be a tad too much...

Oh well, he still has a while to decide, and he can always change his mind during the ride there..."

"event","Daddy went and saw the baby kittens tonight. He says that they are black and white or pure black, not grey striped as he was told at first. Not mine *sniffles* Oh well, I am too young to be a daddy anyhow. I just don't like the thought that now I never will be. Oh well... 

In other news, daddy is going to the Wolfsheim concert in Detroit tommorow night. He has a ride, so he doesn't have to drive on his own, which means that he can actually drink tommorow night. Not that he drinks much, but when he does he doesn't like to drive. Which is probably why he doesn't drink much in the first place *kittensmirk*

I hope he'll have a good time, and with any luck he'll meet a nice gothette at the show..."

"event","Most of you won't really care because you aren't as fanatical about them as daddy is, but Stacey Campbell has left the Cruxshadows. Daddy was really down about it for a bit, because he loves Stacey's stage presence, and thinks she is an incredibly talented guitar player. She is also amazingly beautiful and fun to talk to, but I don't think that had anything to do with daddy being sad... it's all about the music... right :P

Tonight daddy can't sleep again, which means that I don't get any sleep either... it's supposed to be the other way around, I am the one that's supposed to keep HIM awake. Oh well.

In other bad news, I found out what the whole deal with my cat's ration was. I messed up the letters, probably because I never would have thought that he would do this to me. But he had me CASTRATED. I was really pissed about it, took me a moment to grasp it because I was totally out of it for a day or two. But now I realized what happened. My balls are gone. He had the vet emasculate me. Turn me into only half a cat. I was really angry, but then I read about it on the net and found out WHY he did it. Sure, I did pee on his carpet once or twice, but I think he did it because he wants me to live longer and live happily. As happily as I can without testicles...

In good news though, beautiful Tiamat had a litter of kittens on saturday. Daddy has not seen the babies yet, but Sara says that some of them might be mine. I am sure daddy will let me know if I have become a daddy as well. Sara took care of me when daddy was in Germany over something he called christmas break, and Tiamat and Gally are Sara's cats. Daddy and Sara don't know if I errr... got to know Tiamat better, and a gentlecat never kisses and tells. The dates would work out, but Tiamat now lives with another male cat named Bruiser (who still has his balls, thank you very much daddy) and their fourth cat is pregnant as well. But Bruiser is black and white, Tiamat is almost pure black, and Sara said on the phone that some of the babies have grey stripes... that would be me baby... *grins*

Oh well, daddy apparently wants to try to go to sleep, so I got to keep him awake a little longer *kittysmirk*"

"event","Daddy took me to the vet yesterday morning... I was all excited, since I like going to the vet, even though I hate riding in the car. That's because daddy always puts me in the cat carrier, rather than letting me roam the car freely. I can't really blame him, not after I errr... had a little accident when he took me to the vet the first time. But still, I don't like it. So I voiced my concerns and discomfort for the entire car ride *smirks*

At the vet's place Daddy left me in their care, after filling out some paperwork. I was all happy because I knew that I would get my dues now. Instead they poked me with needles, and then I fell asleep. I never got my cat's ration it seems."

"event","Tommorow Daddy is taking me to the vet, so I can get my cat's ration. I have to get up very early, and even though I hate the car ride I am soooo ready for it. Daddy even made sure that I don't spoil my appetite, so he took away my food bowl tonight. At first I was a little annoyed, but then I realized that he did it because he wanted me to be able to enjoy tommorow to the fullest. Isn't he the nicest guy?Anyhow, he's at work right now, and I am resting up for tommorow, got a big day ahead of me.

Daddy is feeling a lot better than he did last week, he was really depressed for a few days. Apparently there was some problems extending his 'lease' whatever that is, and he was worried that we'd have to move to a new place. I don't want to move out, I love the apartment. Unfortunately Daddy told me that he will go to Germany again for a long time this summer, and he is still looking for somebody to take care of me. I'm a big boy, but I can't really go buy my own food and clean my own litterbox, so he can't leave me alone. And most of his friends can't take me, because they have cats of their own that might not like me. I hope he finds somebody nice to take care of me.

He is totally hyped about a few concerts that are coming up in the next few weeks. Wolfsheim is playing in Detroit on the 27th, Rasputina is playing in Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor on the 15th and 21st of April, and he is looking forward to something called M'Era Luna, even though that is still half a year away...

I wish he'd take me to those shows, but I hate riding in the car, and most clubs discriminate against cats."

"event","Not that I have been in love in my life, or lost love, but I love these songs and they make me think that I know what it would be like.

10. The Mission UK - Shades of Green
 The Mission UK are one of daddy's favourite bands, and he really loves this song. It is about betrayal, unfaithfulness, and a man's attempt to cope with it. Only in the end does it become clear that his lover was not the only one to be untrue.

9. Bad Religion - 1000 Memories
 Another favourite band of daddy's, Bad Religion has been a powerful force in the punk scene, mixing socio-political messages with kick-ass tunes. 1000 Memories deals with a man's more or less successful attempt to deal with the memories of a lost love, who now to him is 'nothing but a picture and a thousand memories'

8. The Cruxshadows - Marilyn, My Bitterness
 This song should probably be ranked a little higher, but there are already two other Cruxshadows songs in the top 5, so Marilyn ended up here. Rogue's powerful lyrics describe how the singer tries to understand why his lover left him, and what she is doing now, and while he vows to carry the pain and be strong, the chorus still echoes with his need to be with her, his feeling of being lost without her. Yet he also knows that one day Marilyn will realize what she did and will regret it. Marilyn actually does mean 'bitterness' I think, so we cannot be sure whether Rogue is singing of an actual past relationship or not. 

7. The Mission UK - Trail of Scarlet
 Another song by Wayne Hussey and the Mission UK, Trail of Scarlet is the bitter, scathing rant of a man who was betrayed and had to learn from a friend. While Shades of Green is still civil to her ('Don't wish you any pain but I don't ever want to see you again') Trail of Scarlet is more angry than hurt, mostly because in this song the singer himself had been faithful to his lover.

6. Skyclad - Little Miss Take
 Another bitter song, this one by England's Skyclad, Little Miss Take is full of sarcasm, cynical jokes, and plays on words, and rather amusing. The cheating ex-girlfriend is turned into an object of ridicule and scorn, rather than somebody the singer is still hung up about.
  
5. Blind Guardian - When Sorrow Sang
 This song is beautiful, but the lyrics are very specific to Tolkien's Silmarillion. The lovers are separated by many bounds (including death as the speaker seems to be a ghost) and the speaker revels in his memories for her, his longing for her. He refuses to fade away until they can say their farewells, while she is crying over her lost love, not knowing that he can hear.

4. The Cruxshadows - Monument
 Another beautiful song by the Cruxshadows this is one of their slower, more mellow pieces. It is a lover's lament that he never wrote a love song for his lady while they were still together, and that it is too late now. So instead he will build a monument to the times they shared, so he can always remember what he had and could not hold on to. The song features a beautiful recitation of a poem by Keats, which proves that Rogue can blend his own words with those of other great poets almost seamlessly.

3. Bella Morte - Regret
 Daddy listened to this song for quite a while after his last relationship ended. The singer wonders why his lover decided to leave him, if another guy was involved, and whether she had been truthful to him from the beginning. He finds comfort in knowing that he did everything he could to keep her, and that he will find a new love, while she will one day realize just what she threw away (similar to The Cruxshadow's Marilyn) And that one day she will want him back, but that by then it will be too late.

2. Sinead O'Connor - This is the Last Day of our Acquaintance
 This song is just sad. Sinead sings about the day that a divorce is about to be finalized, that she is about to meet her soon to be ex-husband in an office and that she will try again to salvage their love but knows that she will fail. Her voice is haunting, the song is just beautiful, and it undeservedly was ignored in favor of 'Nothing Compares To You'

1. The Cruxshadows - Go Away
 The third Cruxshadows song in this list (do you recognize a pattern here? :P) this song is great on CD, but breathtaking when performed on stage. Rogue sings about a love that once was pure and sweet, but now has faded, and all his fears of what might happen have come true, because she told him that she no longer loved and wanted him. It is very very moving.

Of course there are a whole bunch of other great songs like that out there, but these are probably my favourite ten at this time. Still, it depends on my mood, and sometimes I really love hearing The Mission and am not in a Bella Morte mood at all, so take these with a grain of salt."

She is doing a lot better, but still seems a little under weather. She is getting anti-biotics twice a day, which she really seems to like, but is still a little lethargic at times.

Daddy still has to tell HIS mommy and daddy how much he had to pay for the vet. He says it was worth every cent to have Tink back, but I know he had to reschedule my own appointment so he could pay for both. Yeah, I am going to the vet in two weeks. Dad says I am getting my Cat's Ration. I don't know what that is, but I think it is something like the Lion's Share. He seemed kinda sad when he told me that he scheduled my Cat's Ration, but I am sure it is because he is sorry that I can't get it next week. After all, if it is for cats, it is my due to get it as soon as possible. Or it is because he is a human, and is not entitled to a Cat's Ration...

Dad is still worried about her of course, but he knows that she is in the best hands, and is getting the best medical attention she can get. I hope she pulls through, she has been with dad for almost a year and a half now, and sure, rats don't live as long as us cats, but daddy had hoped that Tink would live for two or three years at least, which is possible if rats are taken good care of.

Okay, not that, but I give you three points if you catch that pop culture reference (3 million points are redeemable for a fish head)

Anyhow, here are my top 10 favourite songs about vampires, or related topics :P

10. Skyclad - Catherine at the Wheel.
This song by the British folk-metal combo Skyclad is about a child-vampire (think Claudia from Interview with a Vampire) that uses her apparent youth to lure dirty old men to a well-deserved demise. While Skyclad made better songs this is still a solid performance, and deserves a spot in the top 10.

9. Beborn Beton - Hemoglobin
A high-energy fast-pace song by this German band deals with the loneliness and despair that comes from being immortal and seeing time passing, leaving you unchanged. The pace of the song is out of sync with the lyrics (except for the chorus) but the beat just makes you want to jump up and dance.

8. Wench - Heart of Darkness
Eerily haunting, seductive, a song that makes you think of moving shadows, whispering voices telling you forbidden secrets and luring you into pleasures best not tasted. This song is one of the best songs by this SF Bay Area band, whose style cannot be described, but must be experienced.

7. Paralyzed Age - Bloodsucker 2000
Another fast-paced high-energy song by a German band, this song's lyrics are dark but amusing, and evoke images of Transsylvanian castles and cowering peasants hiding behind stout doors and wreaths of garlic as the sun goes down.

6. Iced Earth - Dragon of Blood
Iced Earth is one of the best current US power metal bands, and their release 'Horror Show' is a homage to horror movies and their creatures. Dragon of Blood is a beautiful but tragic power ballad about lost love, hope betrayed, and the horrible revenge that followed. If you saw Bram Stoker's Dracula with Gary Oldman you will recognize the theme of damnation due to love. While the sheer power of the music is intense in itself, the lyrics turn it into a piece of pure beauty.

5. Voltaire - Vampire Club
Not exactly a song about vampires themselves, but instead about wannabe-vampires and their antics, this song by New Jersey's Voltaire (an incredibly talented artist and musician) is simply hilarious. Lines such as 'Dressed in black from toe to head, singing ""Bela Lugosi's STILL Undead""' bring a smile to my face everytime I hear them.

4. Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead
One of the original goth bands, this rather long piece has surprisingly little in the ways of lyrics, but the lyrics work great. Catch The Hunger with David Bowie to see it performed, it is simply breathtaking.

3. Bella Morte - Fall No More
Bella Morte is one of the premier deathrock/darkwave bands of the United States, and are slowly developing a well-deserved following in Europe as well. Still they are nowhere near as popular and famous as they deserve. Fall No More is an example of their incredible talent as songwriters and musicians, as mellow but powerful song, that should have gotten way more attention that it has.

2. The Cruxshadows - Deception
Featuring an incredible violin solo by the beautiful Rachel McDonnell this song helped catapult the Cruxshadows to the top of the Goth/Darkwave scene, and got them the attention that they deserve. While they are still not nearly as well known in America as they should be, they are highly successful in Europe and people in the know in the US eagerly anticipate each new release. Deception is similar to Skyclad's Catherine at the Wheel in the way that it deals with a young female and her vulnerability. In the music video (which you will never see on MTV) it does become clear that she is using vulnerability as a weapon, and that there is more to her than meets the eye. The chorus 'Pray for Daylight, Pray for Morning, Pray for an End to our Deception' gives a pretty good idea what she really is.

1. Sting - Moon Over Bourbon Street
Easily the most beautiful vampire song ever written, Sting manages to convey the image of a vampire haunted by his own instincts, his need to love, and his inability to keep himself from destroying what he cares about. He makes you feel the vampire's loneliness, his yearning for his lost humanity, and the spark of beauty and goodness still burning in the depths of his soul. Daddy loves this song, it does not exactly make him cry, but it is one of the songs that resonates with him, that expresses what he feels sometimes, in a way that he could not do himself because he does not have the words."

"event","Daddy is at work right now, and I got nothing to do but look for tuna and listen to his music. I tried to get his movies to work, but it's tough to reach everything with my little paws.

I have grown huge though, Uncle Scott says I am already bigger than Honor, and Honor is much older than me. Of course Honor is also mostly fluff Uncle Scott and Daddy say, but I would not know, I never met her. I picture her as this beautiful black cat with amazingly beautiful eyes that is just aching to meet me. After all, all the girls are just dying to meet the Bounce, aren't they?

Anyhow, Daddy was in a bit of a funk lately. He feels lonely, and he is trying to get over it in the best way he can. He tries to ignore it, to tell himself that he is too strong to let this get him down. He sees every day as a challenge to begin with, so what's a little raise to the stakes? Daddy says 'Nothing in this life is given to us. All we have is what we work for and earn' and this is Daddy's problem. Part of him thinks that he's not working hard enough for the things that he wants, his degree, his art (he loves to write, but hasn't done it in forever) and the things that really matter to him. Instead he spends his time playing silly videogames or surfing the Internet. There is nothing real there, it's all fluff. Daddy needs something real in his life. I am good for him, as are the rats, but I think we are not enough. Dad needs somebody to share his thoughts with, somebody to talk to about ideas he had for his thesis, to watch a movie with and discuss it later on.

Dad does not even really need a highly romantic relationship lasting until the end of forever. He can be a romantic, but he does not believe in candy-coated cuteness forever. He mostly wants a cuddlebuddy, somebody to hug, somebody who will eat his meals with him, who will cheer him up when he is blue, who will laugh when he tells a joke. I would do all these things for him if I could, but I am not as good as it as I would like to be.

Oh well, I am not sure if I should share this here. But then again, the only people who will see this are Daddy's friends anyhow, so it's cool."

"event","... for Bounce's Top 5 CDs of the week...

1. Nick Cave - Murder Ballads.

Okay, a whole CD devoted to murder, definitely sounds screwed up, doesn't it? But if you look past that commonality you have a surprisingly artistic and diverse collection of songs, ranging from the hauntingly beautiful ballad ""Where the Wild Roses Grow"" with Kylie Minogue to the rough ""Stagger Lee"" which would have a radio edit containing more 'bleep's than actual words. Favourites are 'O'Malley's Bar' which describes a night of carnage at the local Irish pub (but quite humurously if you look past the violence) and 'The Curse of Millhaven' which makes me smile every time I hear the line 'They ask me if I feel remorse, and I answer 'why of course' there's so much more I could have done if they'd let me' Don't get me wrong though. I do not find murder funny in reality. There is nothing amusing about mass murderers, shootings, or anything like that. There is a difference between fact and fiction though, and fictional killings can be entertaining, as long as you remain aware of the difference.

2. Danzig - III How the Gods Kill

Staying with big creepy dudes singing creepy songs we have Danzig III, How the Gods Kill. More diverse than Danzig's first two albums, he sheds a bit of his blues influences, and explores a wider variety of styles. From the slow and eerily haunting 'Sistinas' to the more upbeat and fast-paced 'Dirty Black Summer' and 'Do You Wear the Mark?' the songs are solid and ear-catching. The most powerful song is clearly 'Anything' while Danzig's vocals on 'Bodies' are great as well. Unfortunately there are no songs (with the exception of 'Anything') to match some of the great songs on earlier releases, such as 'Devil's Plaything' 'Her Black Wings' or 'Mother' but the CD as a whole sounds more refined, a little less monotonous.

3. The Clash - The Clash on Broadway

Here we have the quintessential The Clash collection. A three CD set featuring almost 80 songs by this incredibly talented UK punk band. While there are some weak tracks of course, the power of 'Should I Stay or Should I Go?' and 'Rock the Casbah' cannot be denied. While the original vinyl collection was relatively cheap, not costing more than a regular record at the time (the band wanted it to be affordable for the fans) the CD version is a little pricey at somewhere around 30 dollars, but it is 30 dollars well spent on good music. Personal favourites include 'English Civil War', 'Spanish Bombs' and 'Career Opportunities' as well as 'Washington Bullets' and 'I Fought the Law (and the Law Won)'

4. Original Soundtrack - Platoon

One of daddy's favourite movies, this story of a young infantryman in Viet Nam can only be described as 'intense'. Focusing less on the brutality of the war itself, but on the moral struggle of the young protagonist in a war he no longer believes in, is one of the most powerful movies ever made. It also features a very interesting soundtrack, which gives an interesting overview of the music of the time. Ranging from extreme anti-hippie songs (Merle Haggard's 'Okie from Muskogee' which has dad laughing his ass off every time he hears it) to psychedelic music comparing Alice in Wonderland to an acid trip (Jefferson Airplane's 'White Rabbit' one of only two songs Daddy ever sang at Karaoke) this CD is just great. Some songs are almost corny (while I like the lyrics to 'When a Man Loves a Woman' I would gladly give up one of my nine lives to hear it sung in a voice that is NOT whiny as hell) while others are simple, relaxed and to the point.

5. Qntal - III Tristan und Isolde

Qntal is a band that defies description. Beautiful medieval songs meet modern synthesizers, blending in with the incredibly beautiful voice of singer Syrah, to create music that makes the listener forget time and space and just feel like he's floating among the stars. The songs are in latin, ancient french, old german and old english, which means that you don't really understand most of the lyrics unless you look them up. The favourites at this time are 'Entre Moi et Mon Amin' and a faster version of 'Ecce Gratum' from Carl Orff's 'Carmina Burana'"

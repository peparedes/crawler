"event","Prom is upon us, and much sooner than originally planned no less.  I suppose I will attend.  Never have I been keen on the negative connotations of the event, but alas.  Such nonsense aside, it would be to my best interest to be there.

"event","Certain people I know would say attending the party would have been to my benefit.  I believe there are leagues between social experience and moronic activity.  I can only imagine what sorts of things transpired at that party.

It has been nigh two months since I last posted.

I returned home come New Year, as I planned.  It was a restful return.  It would have been more so had my guardians refrained from prodding me about particular aspects of my life in Oshima.  Their parental concern I can understand, but they too should understand a woman deserves her privacy.  Besides, I had nothing to hide from them.  Perhaps that to them is a concern in of itself."

"event","The holidays come and go, just as any other day, except with an added tinge of nostalgia for times long passed.  I suppose I'll wish everyone a happy holiday out of customary congeniality.  I assume all is well during these festive times?  I would add a wish of good luck for the upcoming year, but I believe luck is determined by your own doings.  If you conscientiously keep up with all you do, more pleasant outcomes and opportunities will come your way.

I have not been home for quite some time, yet I cannot say I miss it terribly as I've been preoccupied with my time here on the island.  Perhaps I'll return for a short while after New Year's.  I would return sooner if it were not for my involvement in an out-of-school studio's performance of a stage musical adaptation of the peculiar film <i>Dancer in the Dark</i>.  The last performance does not occur until early afternoon on the 31st.

My friend has not visited me since before coming to Oshima.  For that, I am much grateful.  Moving here has actually proven beneficial."

Impress me.  I don't wish this to be a waste of time."

"event","I have just arrived in Oshima after an uneventful boat ride.  I seemed to have transferred near the conclusion of the semester, so I may not actively attend classes until the start of the next.  It is best to begin when you have the entire semester to work rather than coming in late hoping to scrape by with a passing grade.  I expect the dance curriculum at the school to be as excellent as its reputations boasts, or I will be greatly disappointed otherwise.

The students and faculty appear to be very animated.  I must have missed a big event."

"event","Right, so I finished my Fafsa today, I'm calling U of L (hell) tomorrow and finishing up the money I owe them in a payment plan... I cannot WAIT!&nbsp; I'm so excited to announce the news...&nbsp; I'M GOING BACK TO COLLEGE!<br /><br />I'm so hyped, I think I wanna take a communications class, math class (rudimentary of course since I've been out of college almost 2 years), and definitely my clarinet lessons... OH!&nbsp; And I've always wanted to take an art class!&nbsp; YAY!<br /><br />So EXCITED!<br /><br />as far enough to say...<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://homepage.mac.com/lawrencedavid/cuteanimals/baby_tiger_surprised_face.jpg"" /><br />LOL This excited...<br />&gt;_&lt;&nbsp; adorable isn't he?&nbsp; Not as ""hot"" as a phoenix, but he'll definitely do.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway... So, college choices are as follows:<br />1. Morehead State University<br />2. Indiana University-Southeast<br />3. Eastern Kentucky University<br /><br />I don't really care which one... I'm definitely willing to pick any of them at this point in time, although if I could go back to Morehead I would most definitely have the joy of being with all my old friends!&nbsp; :D&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm happy to be back to my old self, and I can see how happy I am and I'm relieved...&nbsp; I never thought I'd get to go back to be the happy person I once was long ago.&nbsp; W00T for Renaissance and W00T for college!?!?<br /><br />or as my colleagues spell it..&nbsp; c0//3g3 ... well whatever the lingo I'm SUPER STOKED!"

"event","I've been pretty emotional and aware of God's voice this Christmas season. It's...interesting. Lately, for most of this semester I should say, I've felt a bit distant from God. I knew He was there, I knew He was taking care of me, but I was not listening as well as usual to Him and my relationship with Him was suffering. Until about a week or so ago.

Let me give a little background on what happened. One of my dearest friends lost her baby last week. The funeral is tomorrow, and I would appreciate your prayers for her and her husband if you think about it. I've come to realize that God has created me as an incredibly empathetic person. If someone else is hurting, I take that hurt upon myself and do what I can to care for and ease the other person's pain. Facing this loss was harder for me, I think, than many other things I've had to face in my life. I couldn't fix it. I didn't know what to say. All I could do was love. All I can do is love. The other thing I've come to realize is that because I care well for people, because I do my best to love them no matter what, people trust me and are comfortable with me. I make friends easily, which is a new thing for me. I never used to be comfortable with myself and with making friends. Now, every person I meet is a prospective friend, and God has brought some incredible people into my life this way. I am so thankful that God has created me the way that I am, and that He has healed my brokenness when it comes to friendships and trust issues...He had made me clean, pure, and innocent again...but I digress...

I got choked up several times while we were singing at church this Sunday. I really, really enjoy my home church's new pastor, and I believe that God is going to use her in amazing ways to grow New Salem Presbyterian church. She preached yesterday on how NSPC needs to be pregnant with LOVE. And how they need to do everything out of love and nothing else...and then God will bring opportunities to minister to the church. At the evening service, she quoted on of my favorite Scripture passages:

    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with   God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. John 1:1-5.

The light of the world is Jesus. Jesus saves, Jesus extinguishes the darkness, Jesus heals the broken, and Jesus brings saving Grace. I love Him, and my heart breaks everytime someone I know hasn't experienced His love. I think this Christmas season my focus has been returned to Jesus. I rest in His love, because His love comes from God. I have the ability to love others only because the love that I feel from God is overflowing from my heart. I CANNOT do it alone. Let me close with a small prayer, a combination of a few of my favorite Christmas hymns.

O, come, O, come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel. Come, Son of God, love's pure light. Let the radiant beams from thy Holy face illumine our lives so we can see the dawn of thy redeeming grace. Thank you, Lord Jesus, Loving God Incarnate, for coming to as a babe to save us. Be near us and stay close beside us in this coming year, and let us fix our eyes on you, and you alone, the author and perfector of our faith. Amen and Amen."

"event","The semester, that is. And I can scarcely believe it. It's a little crazy, all that God has done in my life in the past few months. I invite you to join me on a journey of relflection on the God's goodness, God's provision, God's steadfastness, and His many other characteristics. Where to start?

Before I get into what God has been doing, I want to ask for some prayer. A good friend of mine, who has truly been a blessing from God to me this semester, lost her baby this week. It has been rough. I am finding more and more that God has broken my heart for others who are hurting, and sometimes it makes life difficult for me too. Please pray that I would have the strength, the love, and the encouragement to care for this friend, even as I am at home for Christmas. Please pray for her and her husband as well, because this was their first baby and they have been trying for a while to concieve. It's particularly hard at this time of the year. I won't divulge their names on the internet, but please just pray. Thanks. Enough sad stuff...on to good things!

I was nervous beginning this semester. I was worried that no-one would come to SWAT, that I wouldn't get along with my new on-campus supervisor, and that working with my new area director would be difficult. I worried about support raising and asking people for money. I stressed out over my leadership team, and I stressed even more about things I did or did not do. But, let me just tell you a little bit about how God has worked through these things.

God has been incredibly faithful in bringing amazing students to SWAT. This group may be smaller, and I may be taking fewer students to Jubilee this year, but it doesn't matter. They are willing to stretch themselves, and they are willing to be vulnerable in a group. But not only did God bring students to SWAT. He brought students into my life who wanted to attend church as well. I have taken at least two students to Pond Bank each week this semester. But God didn't see fit to stop there, even! He brought Angelika into my life. She is a deaf student who really wanted to go to a church that had an interpreter. It just so happens that a friend of mine from Pond Bank is an interpreter and pulled her connections to get me into a sign language class, as well as to get an interpreter there and paid for anytime Angelika wants to go to church. It's amazing the way God works.

Kim, my new on-campus supervisor, is not just an AWESOME boss, but also has become a great friend. I really like the way she thinks, and we definitely work well together. God brings everyone into my life for a reason, and professional development is definitely part of the reason Kim is there for me. She cares about me as a person, as well as professionally. She holds me to a higher standard. It's nice. And she's on my side and will help me out with anything I need, and will let me know if I do something wrong.

The same goes for my new CCO area director (that's CCO lingo for boss). Charity is also awesome. She and I are pretty similar, so she has be pegged pretty well. She can usually figure out what I am thinking and how I will react to certain things. It's nice. Granted, it's tough sometimes to have a boss who holds you accoutable to the things that you are supposed to be doing, as well as challenges you to go a step beyond that. But, I would rather have an involved, caring, questions-asking AD than one who is hands-off. I praise God for working things out to allow Charity to be my boss.

Support raising. Need I say more? Believe it or not, this is not my favorite part of the job. But, God provides. Jehovah-Jireh. So true. I worked my butt off over the summer and at the beginning of the semester trying to get my level of support up. At this time last year, I was barely, and I mean barely, making it. I was hardly at 30% of what my paycheck should have been. After a lot of prayer and prodding, I put the pedal to the metal and worked hard to figure out what being faithful in support raising actually looked like for me. For me, it's about relationships. I couldn't ask for better churches than the ones that take care of me in Franklin County. Pond Bank and Salem just to name two. It's not just about the money. I have found friends and community, and I am thankful for that. I am living in one of the church member's houses for the next three months to save money, as well as she is my support raising accountability partner. She rocks. I am proud to say that right now, thanks to God, Wendy, and lots of hard work, I am at about 50-60% of where I should be support-wise. I have a long way to go, but God is faithful and I am trying.

There are still more areas of my life where God has been faithful and good when I haven't been. He loves me and cares for me more than I deserve. I have been so selfish this past semester, and I haven't spent enough time with Him. Be looking for more reflections in the next few days. I am actually taking some time off over the Christmas holiday to process my semester and to see what I can do better in the future. Please pray for me as I go through this process. And have a wonderful and Blessed Christmas! I love you all! *hug*"

"event","Have you ever felt like you were just stuck? Like you couldn't pray, didn't want to pray, couldn't focus to pray, and guilty over it all? I am a campus minister with the Coalition for Christian Outreach. I put up a pretty good front sometimes, but I definitely don't always have it together. But I've found that it is in those moments of weakness, of feeling stuck, God finds ways to speak to me and to restore my soul.

It's funny the way God works. I read blogs pretty regularly...and oftentimes they are how I connect with God. I have a hard time focusing on writing in my own journal or on my own blog about different Biblical passages and whatnot, so I turn to others. It's nice to have my beliefs reinforced by something else I read. Anyway...recently I read one blog and one article at http://www.relevantmag.com that helped me see God a little more clearly.

In the first, an article that you can read at http://www.thelongbrake.com, the writer reflected on renewal. I've been in some serious need of attitude re-vamping lately, as evidenced in my often crappy mood. When I am not ""plugged into the vine"" very well, I get tired and cranky. In the post previously mentioned, the author states two things that struck me. Here's the first:

    ""you are who you are because of the things you've gone through. God has taken you through some very specific things, both big and small, to shape you into who He wants you to be. it's true. it's not always easy, but it's true.""

Can you say, Wow? I had a bit of a tiff with one of my dearest friends on Tuesday night. But she is a new friend; I've only been spending time with her since about August. She doesn't know the back story to my life. She doesn't know the dark places in my soul where I struggle. It's a challenge for me to go there and share why certain things upset me and why I react the way I do to certain things. I can't blame her for wondering why I was upset when I've never shown her certain sides of me. It's in those moments that I remember. I remember how God has molded me and shaped me into who I am NOW. The old has passed away; the new has come. I am a different person than I was years ago. I hate it when old issues rear their head, but it's then that I go back to God, and He heals me and renews me again. Amen and Amen.

This is how the aforementioned writer closes his post, and I can't echo it more wholeheartedly:

    ""i have come to believe that God is a God of restoration. of redemption. of rescue.

    i believe that God wants to restore you. me. i don't claim to have all of the answers, nor do i claim to understand God very well, if at all. but i do know that rescue is central to who He is.

    so i hope that you, friend, will be restored today. i hope that you will be rescued and gain a more full understanding that God loves you. your past. your present. your pains. your failings and victories. all of it.

    all of it.

    you are who you are because He formed you this way. and He wants you to be who you will be under his rescuing and redemptive hand.

    and as i live, i keep hearing Him say come back. i love you. i want you for who you are. come back. keeping coming back.""

God is my rescuer, my redeemer, my healer. And I can't thank Him enough for that on a day to to day basis. Even when I am in a funk, even when I feel like I'm lost and can't pray, He's still there to pick me up off of my face.

The other article from Relevantmag.com titled ""Wading in the Worry"" ends on this note:

    ""Next time every decision in your life seems to be staring you straight in the face and everything you have so carefully constructed seems to be collapsing, remember the futility of worrying. Instead of lending yourself to despair and anxiety and trying to add days onto your life, please take a chance to remember the timing and sovereignty of God and allow Him to provide you with comfort.

    He has and will provide you with everything that you need; be content to rest in His arms and accept His peace because it might just change your life.""

Amen and Amen. I worry too much somtimes about how badly I've failed in certain aspects of my job, or even what people think of me because of the job that I do. I have to surrender these thoughts to God. He will take them from me and heal me and show me that my real value lies in Him and in Him alone. It's ""the timing and sovereignty of God"" that I have to remember on a day to day basis. He's in charge; not me. He knows what I will do with the rest of my life. He knows who I'll marry, He knows where I'll live out my days, He knows what jobs I'll do. I don't need to worry because He's got a plan, and He's in control. I take comfort in that. When I take the time to lean on Him and to rest in His arms, I am refreshed. And my soul is restored. I just have to remember to go to Him in these times."

"event","Hi folks! Sorry it's been so long since I've updated...my life is a whirlwind of activity these days, and my internet access is limited. I've also had a bit of writer's block...so much has been going on that it's been hard for me to even put words to what I'm feeling! It's craziness...but God is steadfast in the midst of these things.

So, where to start? I guess I can start by telling you all that I have been incredibly challenged lately. I have several students that keep me hopping all the time, as well as I have been struggling with some stuff of my own. It's so hard to be faithful sometimes! It's especially hard when you are alone on a campus, and running the ministry on your own. I have to make some really hard decisions, and I definitely can't do everything. I am beginning to realize why Jesus sent the disciples out two by two. I don't have all the answers, and I can't provide them for every student. Not that I didn't know this before, but sometimes it's just a slap in the face reminder.

And, how the heck do you deal with coworkers who hate working where they do? I love Mont Alto, and I love my students. I understand that they are not all at a level where they are ready to do certain things, like give up their spring break for a service project. What do you do when your coworker insinuates that all Christians should be doing service and should understand the concept? I tried to explain that my students are doing all that they can do and are ready to do right now, but this person just didn't want to hear it. It makes for my job to be a little difficult when there are those who make me feel like I'm not doing it well. Anyway...

On the bright side of things, campus gave me $2100 to take students to Jubilee, and I think we have a church volunteering a bus to drive us out. It's exciting!

And I've been having some good friend time lately. It's awesome when you can connect with someone else in the ministry who is having similar struggles to yours. It is always good to be able to talk through things with someone who understands!

Another exciting thing is that Pond Bank is providing a regular interpreter for my deaf student on Sunday mornings. I am really thankful for this amazing community of people, and I couldn't imagine leaving them right now.

And God sure does like to convict us. Last Sunday, Pastor Lin preached on the ""Honor your father and your mother"" commandment. Imagine that. The Sunday that I am angry with my folks for not coming out to visit, she preaches on how hard it is for us to understand our parents and respect them even if they aren't always great. Wow. Thanks God. It's so hard to be in my position sometimes. Mainly due to the fact that I know I am pleasing God, but displeasing my parents and many other folks from home by not using my college degree and making the big bucks. It's hard to not fit into the mold. But I try my hardest to let that go. God is in control, and I am doing what He has called me to do. I have taken up my cross and followed Him, and that's all that matters. On that note, I need to go do some more support raising stuff. Good day, all!"

"event","Today is the 5-yr anniversary of 9/11.  I think sometimes we so easily forget about all the people who lost their lives that day trying to save others, or simply by showing up for work.  I was just thinking the other day about how I really don't face any danger when I go to work every day.  Yes, it is a spiritual battleground...but I am not generally in any physical danger.  There are people who risk their lives every day to share the Love of Christ.  I don't consider myself to be one of those...sometimes I feel like my job is play.  Sometimes I think people misunderstand my job is a real job.  I hate it when people ask me, ""so, is this a shorttime gig, a bridge job, or do you plan on doing it forever?"" Depending on the circumstances, oftentimes I just tell them that it's up to God what I do two years from now when my CCO contract is up.  But that's not always the answer that is appropriate.  It drives me nuts...

What also got me thinking today was an interaction with one of my coworkers as well as a conversation with my area director.  Not everyone I work with is going to extend grace to me.  Some people just really aren't going to like me.  Some people just really aren't going to be nice.  And that's when I have to extend the love of Christ the most.  That's when I have to be patient and keep my mouth shut.  That's when I have to walk away when I'm upset.  But it's so hard sometimes!  Those old habits die hard.  At least being snappy is not necessarily in my nature.  I don't know how to respond when people are mean to me.  It's tough.

But then I began to put things into perspective.  I have friends here who love me, both on campus and off.  Julie bought me chocolate and dinner today.  Even though it's dreary outside, I can be happy because I know Jesus.  No matter how tired I get, or how hard of a day I am having, when I fix my eyes on Jesus, the author and perfector of my faith, it'll be okay.  Jesus never said we signed up for something easy by following Him, and I have to continually remind myself of that.  Not to say that that is easy...but when I remain positive, remain in prayer, and remain focused on Christ, I'm a much happier person.  And that's it for now."

"event","Wow. The first week of classes is over as of the end of today. It's been a rollercoaster couple of weeks for me. If you were to ask me what I have done these past two weeks...I don't know that I could necessarily tell you. Sometimes it's really a hard thing to explain...but yesterday my landlord described it pretty accurately by stating that I ""just spend a lot of time with people."" That's pretty much the explanation of my job...I help people to feel comfortable with me and to trust me, and then hopefully it will come to the point where I can share the gospel with them. Even if I never do, the ground has been laid. The foundations for friendship and for trust of other Christians in the future has been created. It's hard sometimes to know that I won't always see the results of my labor, but I still love my job. I honestly wouldn't be doing anything else right now.

Yesterday was really cool. I have a deaf student named Angelika this year, and she is a Christian. She desperately wants to go to church, but PSU won't pay for a translator for personal use. Therefore, God bless her, my friend Lisa from Pond Bank came over yesterday and met with Angelika. Lisa's been signing off and on for about 30 years, so she and Angelika had a pretty good conversation...and then after Lisa left, Angelika and I proceeded to have a good conversation (via paper and pencil, mind you) as well. It was really awesome. She's got a cool story, and I really look forward to getting to know her better. She is going to Pond Bank with me on Sunday...Lisa is trying to find someone to interpret for her. But I think she'll like it whether we have an interpreter or not. The people are so wonderful and caring there...I wish I could get more students to go with me. I may have a few going this Sunday...we shall see. Things seem to be pretty hit or miss around here lately.

For example, I had 23 students at chapel Sunday morning and 36 students sign up for SWAT on the list at the involvement fair. But how many actually showed up at SWAT last night? Only about 15 or 20. It was weird. I was even missing a quarter of my leadership team. Maybe it's my fault for not communicating well with them...maybe it's my fault for not advertising SWAT better...however, I was pretty disappointed in some of my leaders last night. It may be a rough year ahead. We shall see! But I'm trying to look on the bright side....if I have reached ONE SINGLE student in my time here, than I have been successful. If I have helped one student step outside of his or her comfort zone and question something, than I have been successful. But it's hard sometimes...I guess I shouldn't set expectations.

I'm excited for Sunday this week. I am playing at Salem, picking some students up to go to Pond Bank, and then heading out to a crab feed with Lin after church. Really excited about that...she's paying for me...all the crabs, chicken, and sides you can eat, and all the beer, soda, and iced tea you can drink. It's to benefit the local retirement home for nuns. Nothing like tossing one back with the local Catholics and having some good conversations! Super excited about it...

Oh well...I'm gonna sign off for now...my area director is coming at 2, and I have some stuff to contemplate and to do before she shows up. I hope the community board meeting goes well tonight! Take care all, and talk to you soon!"

"event","So, I've been pondering again. It's a dangerous passtime. I've been reading the Sisterchicks series of books these past few days. And don't you dare laugh at me. All of us need our releases, and mine just happens to be cheesy, girly, feel-good novels. I know they are super cheesy...but I love them! But anyway...I've been reading these books and realizing how grateful I am for the girlfriends I have.

I was pretty lonely all last year out here in the middle of nowhere...I missed my sorority sisters and the community I had with them. I missed late night donut runs and girly movies. I missed having someone to hold me when I was crying and comfort me when I was upset. But God is good. It took me a year to really realize how important my girls are. 

Today especially I realized that I am going to make it. A newfound girlfriend of mine from here shared with me that she has FINALLY gotten pregnant. I know she's not sharing that with everyone because it's still early. I am truly blessed to be a part of her life. I don't care what age my ""sisterchicks"" are...they are important to me! There's this friend, who is about 28, and then there's my pastor friend who is pushing 50...they both represent different things in my life, and I wouldn't be the same without them. It took a while, but when I was open and allowed myself to be known, the friendships came. Now I have to learn how to make time for them again.

Anyway...here's a shout-out to all my girls...even if we don't talk all the time...you have blessed me in some way...and I am glad to know you. I know that if I ever needed anything...I could turn to any of you and in an instant you'd be by my side if you could. Thanks for all you have been and are to me! I love you! God truly created us to be relational creatures, and for that, I am truly thankful. Amen and Amen."

"event","Well all, it's that wonderful time of year again when my students return. Except this year, I know what to expect. Sort of. There are so many things I should have done last year or this summer, and so many things I shouldn't have done. All I can do is continue to live daily in the light of God's grace and let go of my mistakes. All I can do is be weak and allow Him to be strong and to work out His purpose through me.

While I was at Roxbury recently, one of my favorite pastors used one of my new favorite ""Christian-ese"" phrases. He said that we all need to be ""Jesus with SKIN-ON"" and that we need to find people who for us are ""Jesus with Skin-on"". Hm. Since he used this phrase, I've been trying to figure out what the heck that means for me. How can I be the hands and feet of Christ in my humanness? In my sinful, weak, fallen state? How can I NOT let the things of this world get in my way when I am trying to care for my students and bring them nearer to their Lord and Savior? How can I not let the ""Red tape"" of PSU get in my way? I may not always do things to the best of my ability...and that is not glorifying to God. So how do I deal with it? I let it go when I mess up, let Him take charge, and do better next time. It's taken me a while to learn how to do this. And it's still hard.

It's hard for me as well to balance. It will be different this year because I know the campus folk. I just don't know lots of students yet. How can I get my energy back that I need? Prayer. Rest. Friends. But how do I balance these things? We're still working this one out.

I've also been pondering what it means to walk what I talk. I do to a point, but then there comes the point when I get tired of walking the walk. But I CAN'T....CAN'T give up pursuing the goodness of God. When I focus on Jesus 100% all the time....I can make it. I need to stay focused on Jesus...not on money, not on movies, not on who my future husband will be, not on friends...ON JESUS. Then I can make it and be happy. It's hard...and it goes against all the world has to say...but I have to do it. I am called to do it. I can't be like Peter and take my eyes of Jesus and sink. Yes, we all screw up. But the more I screw up, the further from Jesus I become. And I DON'T like being far away from Jesus. So yeah. That's where I'm at right now. Please pray for my energy levels and my passion as my students return...I was reading my friend Byron's page today...he is so passionate about what he does. He loves his books, and even though he doesn't regularly have students, he loves them as well. He pursues the best at all times. I aspire to be like him. I need to find my passion. I dabble in passions right now. I love Mont Alto. I love my students. But I don't want to support raise for the rest of my life. What are my dreams? What are my aspirations? I am not sure. God is directing my life right now. But what does that mean for the rest of my life? What am I going to do when my three years with CCO are up? Grad school? Teaching? Seminary? What? I'm not too good at saving money right now...or at preparing for the future. So, right now I'm resting in God's grace. That's all I can do. Trust that God is in control...and that it will all work out. Thanks for reading my rambling, and talk to you all soon! ;-)"

"event","So, I've been a very busy girl lately...I led worship Sunday at Salem, went to church at Pond Bank, and then spent the afternoon and part of the evening at Roxbury.  I have been at Roxbury for at least one service a day since Saturday, except for last night.  But God has been good.  In short, I was really having a rough day on Sunday, and God provided a message through the speaker directly to me.  I love it when that happens!  I had a pastor friend and his wife and another woman pray for me, and things have been pretty good since.  There have been some resolutions in the relationship I've been struggling with lately, and God has really given me a peace in that area.

Last night was a huge blessing as well.  Monday morning, after praying Sunday night that I would figure out what it means to have friends and not be lonely out here in Mont Alto, a girl from church gave me a call.  She is really cool, but I would never have expected her to just call me and invite me over to have dinner and hang out.  She's a blessing.  We ate at 5:30, and I ended up leaving around 10.  God is good.  We had good ""girlie"" conversation, ate some cobbler, and LAUGHED!  We had some serious convo in there too...it was a great mixture.  God definitely is good!

But I do have one prayer request...and this seems to be a recurring one.  Please pray that I figure out this housing thing...I like where I'm living...but it's hard sometimes because it's someone else's house.  She really couldn't ask for a better tenant...I have been courteous, clean, and not had a drinking binge parties.  Imagine that!  But she's pretty nit-picky at times...so please pray that I can figure out why God put me here...I know there's a reason...just not sure what.  Please pray as well that if this is not where I'm supposed to be, God would work things out, and that I would trust Him in the situation no matter what.  That not trusting Him thing...it might be why I ended up where I am now.  We shall see what happens!

Anyway...thanks for reading, devoted friends, and have a great day! I'm off to Roxbury with Jodi for Missions day! WoOt!"

"event","You know there's something wrong when it's not even 10 o'clock in the morning and you can SEE the air...yicky humidity. I like the fall, when there are cool breezes and pretty trees. This humidity and heat is fine if you have air conditioning, a swimming pool, or absolutely nothing to do. It stinks for animals and for the elderly and for the young. It's definitely not fun for those who work outside. I prayer walked my campus last night, and it wasn't even that hot. But because of the humidity, I was covered in sweat and nastiness. I said a quick prayer for the kids who are attending band camp on Mont Alto's campus this week...we definitely don't need anyone to die of heatstroke. All I can do is pray that they are taking adequate breaks and drinking lots of water.

Anyway...life has been pretty good lately. Shawn and I have been hanging out more than usual, and it's been really fun. He definitely keeps me accountable to taking time off and to doing my job well! I also got my new computer last Friday. God is super awesome in how He provides for us! A man from one of the churches I attend donated me a brand new acer travelmate 2420 with microsoft office for FREE! Absolutely free. God is good. I thank and praise Him daily for all He does for me, even when I don't deserve it!

One sad note, though. Please continue praying for my friend Georg and his family. His initial surgery to remove the tumor went well, but since then he has had swelling on the brain that the doctors are having a tough time controlling. Then today they found out that he has blood clots in his lungs, which means that he is back in ICU. He can't take blood thinners to fix the problem because it would cause him to bleed on the brain again. So please be praying for him. He is an amazing man of God, and I have been blessed to know him.

I'll be heading out here shortly to let the dog out for my landlord, and then I'm going to a concert in Shippensburg with Shawn. Good times! The only problem is, it's stinkin' hot! Drink lots of water, friends, and stay cool if possible! Take care all!"

"event","Hi folks.  Last week was awesome.  I drove up to Ocean City, NJ to visit one of my students who is taking part in the Ocean City Beach Project.  She's having a blast, and I really think she is benefitting from this summer.  WoOt!  It was really good for me to go up and chat with her and care for her and care for my other friends who are staffing the beach project, as well as meet new students and have other good conversations with them.  It was especially a large blessing to be able to be there while Byron Borger of Hearts and Minds Bookstore was the week's speaker.  He talked about faithfulness in all areas of life, and a wholistic, all of life redeemed perspective on the Gospel.  It was wonderful, as usual!  I purchased ""The Fabric of Faithfulness"" and ""Velvet Elvis"".  Velvet Elvis is such a good book! I bought the audio version and listened to it on my drive back from the beach, and then again on my drive home for my sister's party.  I am really looking forward to ""Fabric"" because I really enjoyed Mr. Garber when he spoke at Staff Sem.  We shall see!  I would definitely recommened both books to anyone who cares about faith stuff at all...both are different kinds of books with similiar purposes...sustaining the church and glorfying God.

Right before I left I got to catch up with one of my best friends from college.  She just happened to be driving through the area, so she stopped by with her boyfriend and we got some Italian food from Arturo's.  It was really good to catch up with her! It was just like old times...sitting around and chatting about life in general.  I miss my 'Minny girls!  But I guess that's just part of growing up sometimes...I know if I ever needed any of my KD sisters, they'd be here in an instant...all I'd have to do was call.  But I still miss living on the suite with them and seeing them daily.  Anyway...

When I got back from the Beach I drove home for my sister's highschool graduation party.  I felt badly for her, because it rained all day and not too many people showed up.  But the bonfire was good, and we got to roast some really tasty marshmallows!

My good friend is finally back stateside after leading a missions trip to Romania.  We are hanging out to catch up and stuff tomorrow around 1.  Super excited!  Can't wait to hear all about it!

My friend Georg's surgery today went well.  They got all of his brain tumor except the ""tail,"" but the doctor's prognosis is pretty good. Praise Jesus!

I should be getting my laptop by the end of this week.   Hooray! God is good, and He provides!

Now onto the deeper part of my post...I've probably been thinking too much lately.  I meet with my new AD on Wednesday.  I was super excited about it until I learned that she is meeting with my new on-campus supervisor beforehand.  I hope that both meetings go well, and that I haven't said anything recently to stick my foot in my mouth.  It seems as though I have been pretty good at that lately.  I definitely said something to my supervisor that I probably shouldn't have said about my relationship with my previous AD, but hopefully she's forgotten by now and won't bring it up to the new AD.  I need to learn to better reign in my anger/hostilities.  When I begin to get angry or frustrated, I automatically go into defense mode.  It's not good.  It's then that I say things I shouldn't, whether they be hurtful or just plain STUPID.  God has changed my heart from stone to flesh in the area of sharing how I'm feeling, but I still need to let go of the angry, hostile side.  I don't get like that often, but I act like a cornered animal when I do.  Anyway...I was just pondering about how much God has changed my heart since I've truly come to know him.  I used to be really really good at putting on the mask and not letting anyone know I was hurt or upset.  NOT ANY MORE!  God has melted that stony mask away and transformed it into vulnerability.  So now the question is what to do with it.  For me to be faithful to who I know I really am, and for me to be faithful to God, I have to learn to control my words and my tongue...because words do damage.  It's so hard though!  Definitely an issue of balance.  Anyway...Sometimes I really wish I could hide things better...but I know that it's healthier to get them out in the open.  I praise God for the work He's already done in my heart, and all I can do is keep asking Him to work on me and mold me to who He wants me to be....all I can do is keep clinging to Him and going back to Him and repenting when I screw up.  I need His strength to get through things and to forgive.  Anyway...enough deep stuff for now....hope you are well and hope to talk to you all soon!   Keep me in your prayers as I head into the new semester pretty soon!  *HUGS*"

"event","Working alone on a branch campus of a public college can be somewhat burdensome.  Let me elaborate.  I now have an on-campus supervisor.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing, however, it already seems to be making things difficult.  I will only be included in one day of OL training and Orientation, as opposed to being involved in everything like last year.  I know that this only makes sense, since I needed orientation to the campus as well last year. But now, my main purpose in being there would be to be a support to staff, and to get to know students.  I dunno...it's going to be an interesting ride.

Please pray for me as I deal with some repurcussions from a slip of the tongue on my part last year as well.  I believe I hurt someone with whom I am on staff, and may have damaged our friendship.  I may be imagining things, but it seems to me as though she really doesn't want to have anything to do with me this year.  Bummer.  I really liked her.  We shall see though.  All I can do is pray, and attempt to live out the forgiveness I thought I had received.  I think it is going to be more predominant this year that I am not just another PSU staff member.  No more flying under the radar. *Sigh* Things are going to be different this year, and that's hard.  I am trying to find community here...and I do have some friends, but none of them are from my age group.  Everyone I've connected with out here so far is at least 37...or married for the most part.  Neither is a big deal, but every now and again it would be nice to have someone to hang out with who is my age and can relate to the things with which I am struggling.  I want Shawn to come home.  I miss having him to spend time with, and I miss talking to him.  *SIGH*

But what can you do?  God is in control.  I keep telling myself this over and over...but it's so hard sometime to relinquish control.  And, Satan wants to infringe, dadgumit!  When I am doing good things, he attacks those weak spots in my life, such as acceptance issues and inclusion issues.  Then he tries to worm his way into my professional life...all I can do is pray that God would kick him back to the gutter where he belongs, and attempt to be faithful in what I've been called to do.  Anyway....enough rambling for now.  Thanks for your support, and please keep praying for me and for my campus! Thanks!"

"event","Processing, Processing...what fun times! It's been an amazing few months...I feel like all I get done is think through the experiences I've had and how I can learn and grow from them. Please bear with me in this post...it's the first place I've thought through these things, so the ideas may be a bit jumbled.

I spoke at Salem twice yesterday and then I went with 15 other folks from there down to Baltimore to hear Billy Graham speak. It was just supposed to be Franklin, but Billy's health allowed him to speak instead of Franklin. It was pretty awesome to know this guy is 84 and has Parkinson's and is still serving the Lord. It was also awesome to hear George Beverly Shea sing. He is 97!!! It was crazy. Going to something like this was a new experience for me. I grew up Presbyterian, therefore the altar call and lots of evangelism stuff are not really part of tradition. I really am not so sure how I feel about the altar call. I did not really like the idea while I was in college. I would never have responded to anything like it, but I think that's more because I am more of a one-on-one kind of personality. However, it got me thinking. Hundreds and hundreds of people went forward when Franklin presented the invitation to come to know Christ or to recommit yourself to Him. It was amazing.

Here's what it made me think. What would it look like if I found a way to present the gospel every week at SWAT? Why am I so afraid to offer an invitation to the students with whom I interact? How can things be different this year? Things are actually looking up, and I am really, honestly going to try to be more intentional about sharing the actual gospel of Salvation with my students this year. I need to let go of my fear of scaring them away, and look at it as an opportunity to help folks enter the Kingdom of God in a non-abrasive and non-confrontational manner. So the next step is to figure out what that is supposed to look like. Please be praying for me as I figure this out, and please pray for my students as well, both the ones I've already known for a year and the ones I don't yet know, that their hearts would be open to Christ.

On another note, this is going to be a busy week. I am helping campus prepare for orientation, so I have a meeting with department people on Thursday. Tomorrow night, praise Jesus, I am having a phone conversation with Jeff Obafemi-Carr's agent about bringing him to campus this year. In case you don't know who he is, he co-starred with Michael W. Smith in The Second Chance. My students loved the movie at Jubilee, and I can't wait to see what happens when I bring both him and the movie here.

And at 4:00 today I have a community board meeting. My first with the new AD and on-campus supervisor present, and my last with the old AD. I am meeting with the old AD for the last time at 2:30. I'm a little bit nervous because there are a lot of things I need to get off my chest with him before we part ways, but I have to figure out how to do it in a gentle, loving manner. So pray for me if you read this before then. I also am nervous about working with my new supervisor. She seems cool, but with all the crap that happened last year at the end of the year, I'm moving gingerly in how I interact with her. We'll see. I also am nervous about how the community board is going to receive the changing of the guard. I hope it goes well, and I really am looking forward to watching the new AD help my community board function better. It's going to be a good year, working with her and with my new supervisor, I just know it. I can only pray that God will bless the ministry here yet again!

On a lighter note, I get to hang out with the CCO president and the Development team this afternoon for dinner! I feel priveleged! How often does the president of your organization come to your area and give you a call to go out to dinner with him and the folks he's with? I really like these folks, and I'm sure it will be a time of refreshing for me.

Anyway, that's just a quick update. I hope to put up pictures of the new place soon. Haven't really had time to take pictures yet! But I'm loving it so far...it's quiet, safe, and close to campus. I can ride my bike! I really am enjoying it so far...thanks for your prayers! Love ya guys!

OH! I also forgot to mention the blessing I am receiving soon! I am getting a FREE! YES, FREE! Laptop computer! One of the families I've met out here runs a computer business and he's donating one to my ministry! How awesome is that? More on that story later, cause it's really cool...have a great day!"

"event","Whew! It's been a long 2 months! I can't believe this time next week, it'll be July! I've been back in the Mont Alto area for a week...dealing with the torrential downpours and flooding. I have bene house-and-dog sitting for a friend this week, and it's been an adventure. But more on that later. I'm BAA-ACK! And it's good to be back. I missed the community here and my friends from here. It's amazing the way God develops relationships. So, let me attempt to tell you in a nutshell what the past two months have entailed for me. 

Let's see...it all started with heading to Spring Institute in May...which was a challenge. It was hard to be back around everyone all at once again after a year alone. I have community here, but it definitely looks different than CCO community and is separate from CCO community. Both are good, and both are healthy (I think) but it's hard to transition between the two. It was awesome to room with my friend Brandie and to get to spend some time with some other friends. It was an interesting first week. And then I headed into the woods. Wow. Still processing this experience. This trip was so different from the trip I took after my senior year of highschool. It was physically, spiritually, and emotionally challenging yet again, but in a different way. I was the YOUNGEST on the trip. How crazy is that? But it was good to receive guidance and to be involved in true loving community. We hiked 1-1.5 miles up a mountain. It was straight up, until we reached 3500 feet. I'll hopefully be able to post some pics in the future. I was scared to do it, and almost copped out, but Harbo talked me into it and I was fine. It was good to spend time with the group that went up and get to know those who I didn't know as well better. And the best part was allowing people to care for me. Becky carried my bag down, and Kelly placed her feet firmly in front of my so I could slide into them. Wouldn't have made it down the mountain without injury without them. Good folks. But more on that later...

Then I went home for a week of vacation and a week of support raising/school stuff. Fun times! I washed down my Gram's porch, caught up with my friend Stang, and read alot. It was good to be home for a while, but I definitely am where I belong now. It was hard to live, but good to leave at the same time....I don't know how to explain it. Home is not the healthiest environment for me, I am discovering. I love my family, and they are wonderful, don't get me wrong. But they don't understand what I do and they don't understand my schedule and they don't understand me. Our beliefs are somewhat different, and it's hard for me to be around the negativity. But God is good and He provides. It was a good time of reflection and learning to live in the midst of change.

Now that I'm back at Mont Alto, I have a new supervisor and a different area director. I am looking forward to the fall, but I am also pretty scared about all that it entails. I really need to get my prayer life back on track, and start praying harder for my students and for the ministry this year. I have so many dreams, but achieving them is all up to God...and transitions are hard. I am praying that I can keep my energy up, and that transitions go smoothly. So, please pray for me. That's about it for now...there's definitely more, but I'm not sure how to put it all into words just yet...so maybe in another post. Hope you all are well!"

My internet access for the next few weeks is going to be sketchy....so I may or may not be posting frequently.  Here's a little rundown of what I'll be doing so you can be praying for me....

Spring Institute Training with the CCO: May 21-June 2nd...I'll be on a canoe trip the 28-2nd...craziness! Please pray that my ankle does okay...this will be it's first test!
New England Camp Cherith: June 4th-June 11th....WoOt! Super excited...I get to teach archery to the counselors and hang out with some really awesome folks!
June 11-??: I'll be at home in good ole' Uniontown, PA....I have a wedding, and I'll also be doing some support raising and relaxing....please pray that I can get along with my parents okay, and that my support raising is fruitful...thanks!

When I'm done at home, I'll come back here to Mont Alto.  I have a new place withing walking distance of campus...I think I might bring my bike back with me.  Anyway, thought you all would like to know what I'm up to....thanks for your prayers! *HUGS*"

"event","Hey friends.  So, I've been thinking...I think I need to discontinue use of Xanga and livejournal.  I don't really have time to keep them up well, and I really enjoy posting on blogspot.  I have facebook, and I was also considering getting myspace.  Maybe I'm too wrapped up in this whole internet thing.  I won't even have time to do too much of it over the summer.  But what do you all think?  Should I stick to blogspot only?  Should I get a myspace account?  I don't use facebook often....it's mainly to keep track of my students. 

I also think I am going to start a blog on my ministry.  For those friends of mine who are technologically able, it will be easier for them to access, more up to date, and cheaper for me.  I get tired of paying to copy newsletters and mail them out!  But enough on that...

I think I deserve either sushi or a good cup of coffee tonight.  I have had a long few days...and I worked really really hard on my newsletter today to get it finished.  I deserve the time off. 

But I've also been trying to figure out how in the heck I am supposed to be a good steward of my money lately.  It's tough! I don't like being an adult and having to pay rent, pay loan bills, buy my own groceries, etc.!  It is definitely an interesting ride, and definitely not always a fun one!  Especially when I chose to have a job that entails raising half of my salary.  Not fun, but good.  It's challenged me to think about how I use my money, and where each cent comes from.  It's kind of crazy.

Anyway, I'm done rambling for now...I'm sure there are tons of other thoughts up in this crazy head of mine...but for now I'm off to copy my newsletter for the community board mailing and to do a few other errands....hope you all are having a great day! *hug*"

"event","Wow.  The semester is over.  I have survived my first year of ministry.  All of my students will be gone from campus tomorrow.  I don't know what I'm going to do with myself!  It's really really odd to be on this side of life.  I know that some of them will be coming back in the fall, but others I might never see again! Imagine that!  This summer is going to be full of craziness...I'm working in ME for 10 days, Joy is getting married, I'm canoeing for Spring training with a bunch of canoeing virgins...and hopefully having a lot of fun and learning a lot in between!  I hope to lead a Bible study for locals around here...and do a lot of planning for the fall...but I need to invest in a computer...and I know my rents are not going to be so keen on that idea....we'll work on it. 

I'm excited and nervous to be moving about two weeks...not officially moving in yet, that'll happen in July, but I am lugging my stuff out of my current apartment and moving most of it into the place where I will be living soon.  Craziness.  I can only pray that I am making the right decision.

Shawn and I have been hanging out a lot more lately.  It's good times having a friend who I don't work with....but it's bittersweet because I haven't been hanging out with Julie and Kelly as much.  Who knows if Kelly will even be back in the fall?  We'll leave it all up to God.  I've learned so much this year....grown quite a great deal...and realized this is the first thing, other than my sorority and college, that I've committed to for more than a few months.  I guess that's a good thing! Anyway...I am going to go hang out with some of my students for lunch...maybe I'll write more later.  Hope you all are well! I'm doing just fine, even though the last post was kinda down...we all have our days! Talk to you soon! *hugs*"

"event","So, yesterday was my day off.  It was most definitely needed.  Tuesday was a LONG day, but in the end it turned out okay.  I still don't know where I'm living in the fall...so if you could be in prayer about that and about my support raising...it would be great and much appreciated.  But I digress....

Anyway, I slept till almost noon yesterday, got up, took a shower, drank some coffee, and spent some serious time with God.  I read my Bible, I'm re-reading ""Perspectives"", and I read through the journal that I have been keeping since last August.  It's almost full now, and man, has it been through the war!  My life is like a roller coaster sometimes...but I guess that's to be expected when you do your best to follow the Holy Spirit and God's call on your life!  I went to the dollar store yesterday and then I went to Rita's and treated myself to some Mango water-ice.  It was good stuff.  Then I made some stir-fry for dinner and talked to my friend who is in MS for the week on the phone.  He is doing well and having a great time. 

But I haven't told you yet about the best part of my day.  Sometimes it's very hard being the lone pioneering staff member at Penn State Mont Alto.  However, God has been very good for me.  If I got nothing else out of my college career and new staff training, I got good friends.  I talked to one of my sorority sisters last night for about 20 minutes...we are hoping to get together this weekend while I'm home, and I'm hoping to trip back in June to see her play the Mad Hatter in Alice In Wonderland.  Then I talked to my friend from Indianapolis for a good hour and a half.  We processed through some of my issues with speaking in tongues and prophesying.  (Issues to be addressed in another post...both took place at my fellowship's retreat this past weekend).  While I was talking to this friend, another friend from Cincinnatti called me.  We played phone tag for a bit, but around midnite she finally caught up with me and we chatted until 2 am about various things.  She comes from a tradition that practices speaking in tongues.  She had three bits of advice for me: 1. Don't invite this speaker back 2. Don't invite people to speak outside of my tradition without first giving them clear guidelines about what they can and cannot speak about.  3.  Be more assertive with my student leaders.  I am working on all three of these things.  We definitely had an awesome conversation processing through my first year on staff, her first year on staff, mistakes we've made, good things we've done, and various other things.  It was a healthy, good conversation.  I love my friends.  This friend and I also talked about change.

There are changes on the wind.  My undergrad school is changing, the org. I work for is changing, lots of my friends are going through various changes, my family dynamics are changing, and life at Penn State Mont Alto is changing.  There is much uncertainty about some of these things, but it's all good.  I know God is in control, and I know the Holy Spirit is moving because I can feel it.  Loving what you do and following God's call is hard, but it's good.  It might be painful to love at times, but it was painful for God to send His only son to die for us.  That's how we know it's real.  When my heart breaks for my students, for my friends, and for my family because I love them so much and I want them to know the love of God the way I do, that's when I know my faith is real.  I praise and thank God everyday for taking my heart of stone and turning it into a heart of flesh.  Even though it hurts to have that heart of flesh pierced and wounded, it is full of life, and full of love.  I would rather cry out of love any day than be imprisoned by bitterness and rage.  Thank you, Lord, for saving my from myself.  Anyway, enough preaching for the day.  Hope you all are well, and have a Blessed Easter!  I love you all and you are in my prayers!"

Crutches are an interesting invention. As some of you might know, I am a pretty accident prone person. However, I had only been on crutches once or twice in my life for some simple sprains. Until March 24. After a good morning of the last T-teams at Messiah college, a friend and I decided we would go to 10,000 villages to check the place out. I'd been there before, but she had never been, so it was a good experience. I bought a ring and we had a good ole' time looking around at the various world items. But little did I know that when we went to leave I would be in for an adventure.

You see, the curb at 10,000 villages is quite high and I have tripped over it before. But usually, I can catch myself. This time was different. I fell off the curb, ripped the left knee of my jeans and severly sprained my right ankle. No driving for me for a while! I was sure that I had broken it. I rode with my friend back to Messiah and we had two of our wilderness folks look at my ankle. No decision was made as to whether or not it was broken then, but it was very swollen and nasty looking. The verdict of the wilderness guys was that it was too swollen to be xrayed at the moment, and not severe enough for me to bother sitting in the crazy ER on a Friday night. So, I called a friend from church, we drove to her house, I sacked out on her couch for the night, and she drove me to the ER the next morning. Good times. Crutches for a month. Hooray.

But I digress. I ended up taking last week off from work, since I couldn't be on my stupid foot for more than 2 hours without it swelling to about 3-4 times its normal size. But God taught me a lot in that one week. It's funny, because we had had an annoiting service at church the week before where I had asked God to anoint me with better rest and sleep. Little did we know that He was going to use an injury in order to get my attention and slow me down!

I have been humbled a great deal by this experience. I am a very independent person, and I like my time alone. But usually, that time alone is spent away from my apartment. Since I can't drive, I was stuck at home or stuck asking for someone to take me to where I needed to go. I am truly blessed to have the friends that I do here. God has brought some awesome people into my life, and I know I'll never be the same because of them. Several of my friends have been hauling my butt everywhere from work to church to Walmart to out for food. Not that I wouldn't do the same for them, but it has taken a lot for me to accept the kindness and not become irritable and bitter because of my weakness. God is good. I think overall this injury was meant to teach me to rely more on my peers and my friends and on Him. I'm still learning and processing, and I am still really stubborn, but I still praise God for my busted ankle! Thanks for reading my musings!"

"event","I have always loved Caedmon's Call. From the first time that I heard ""This World,"" I was captivated. When Derek Webb broke off to do his own thing, I was pretty disappointed and worried they wouldn't have any more albums. I was wrong. I stayed away from Derek's stuff until recently...I purchased ""Mockingbird"" at Jubilee. Probably the best purchase I've made in a long time. You really should listen to it sometime. And then yesterday, I purchased ""The House Album"" at Christian Light for $5. Another awesome purchase. Here are the lyrics to a really good song on that record. It's titled ""Every Grain of Sand"" and is originally a Bob Dillon song. If you want to go hear Derek Webb in concert sometime, I am hoping to go to Elizabethtown to hear him on April 28. Let me know if you want to go! Here's the song...I may post other lyrics later. Enjoy!


	""Every Grain of Sand"" by Bob Dillon

In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.

Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.

Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.

I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name.
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.

I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand."

"event","Hi friends! My life has been sheer insanity for the past month.  But it's been good insanity, not bad insanity.  Jubilee took place the weekend of February 24-26, 2006.  What an awesome experience!  I can't even begin to tell you how good of a time my students had, and how much some of the speakers impacted their lives.  They are all glad that I made them go, kicking and screaming. ;)  Tony Campolo rocked their worlds, and the Holy Spirit was definitely moving through our fellowship the two weeks prior to Jubilee.  Everything tied together.  It is amazing the way God works sometimes, when we turn things over to Him!  I have to continually remind myself of such things.  Anyway, Jubilee was awesome.

The Friday morning before we left for Jubilee, I got an desperate email from one of my coworkers looking for drivers for his Spring break trip to Mississippi.  As luck would have it, my spring break intersected with theirs, and I was able to go.  I hadn't had any plans since my students were going to Myrtle beach, so I jumped on board the Tylertown, MS trip.  What an amazing experience.  I can't even begin to describe to you the way God works through other people.  We rebuilt the whole back end of a house and did lots of painting.  But in the process, we were building relationships as well.  We worked with a crew from IN, and it was awesome to see how much work the students with whom I went could get done alongside these skilled workers.  God is good.  The families were very appreciative of all of our work, and I hope to return sometime in the future. 

On Friday, the last day of the trip, we were able to go to New Orleans.  Since I went through staff training with an amazing, faith-filled, joy filled woman from New Orleans, I thought I'd call her up and ask her what we should see while we were there.  Little did I know that this would be the reason I was present on this trip.  My friend told us that if we wanted to see the New Orleans that was, we should go to the French Quarter.  Then, she said that if we wanted to see true destruction and what Hurricane Katrina really did, not what we had seen on TV, she would give us street by street directions to get there.  This was her home.  She told us how to get directly from Canal Street in the city to the Ninth Ward.  The Ninth Ward is the section of the city hit worst by the storm, and it is where my friend lived.  She is now in Philadelpia working for the CCO, and her family is living outside the city with some other relatives.  The devastation was overwhelming, and I really was profoundly affected by it.  Upon crossing the bridge into the ninth ward, the guy who was leading the trip and all the students in my van gasped.  There were ""Oh my goodnesses"" and other such responses.  And once we got down into the area and up close, things were even harder to digest.  Had it not been for my connection with my friend during training, I would not have been able to take these students to see this horrific sight.  Had I not been on this trip, they would have missed seeing the true damage and left feeling like LA was okay. 

There is much to be done.  I can only hope that by seeing the Ninth Ward, the students I was with were impacted to bring change.  I hope that they go home and share what they learned, and what they saw, and challenge the rest of us to not forget New Orleans.  It is not all fixed.  It is not all better.  There are still many folks who need aid, and the city will probably never be the same.  I am thankful to God for the way He used this trip to open my eyes to my lack of knowledge about many things.  I am also thankful for the connections and bonds that were formed on this trip.  The friends I made will be friends for a long time, and I am sure I will use my fellow CCO staff member as a resource in the future.  It was awesome to watch him work with his students all week, and also to hear the behind the scenes facts that his wife shared with me.  Praise God for a really, really good Spring break!

That's about all I have for now, friends.  I am still processing quite a few things, and I will be picking up my pictures today.  Please pray for me as I begin debriefing my students after Jubilee, and sharing their experiences with local congregations.  Also pray that I can share my MS and LA experience with them in a way that will change their thinking about what they possess.  Many blessings to you!"

"event","Wow. Thank you God for allowing me to attend a college where the CCO was present. I am so blessed to understand this evangelistic, God in all things, reformational worldview. At times, it's really trying because I can't explain all that I know about living out my faith to my students in a nutshell. God doesn't fit in a nutshell. Sometimes, I wish I could shut off my brain. I wish I thought differently than the way that I do. But as past posts and ponderances have stated, I'm committed to being an oddball. I think differently and people don't always understand me. Why do I analyze a movie every time I go to see one? Why is education so important to me? Why do I love to read and analyze so much? Because the CCO taught me that by doing these things, I am being faithful to Christ.

Jubilee is this weekend, and it's the epitomy of all the work the CCO does. I am super excited to expose my students to the full-blown CCO experience, because right now all that they know of the CCO is what I've told them. So, I'm excited that they will get to see that the CCO is a real organization and that the things I talk about are honestly legitimate.

I can't decide what I'm going to do about taking a day or two off after Jubilee yet. I know that I probably won't sleep much this weekend...which merits me taking at least a day off...and I will probably take Monday off...but do I take Tuesday off as well? And then have Wednesday as my regular day off? I feel like I'll miss everything that happens on campus...and I don't really remember my campus ministers taking days off after Jubilee....I dunno...I guess I'll talk to my area director about it.

Currently I am struggling with meeting my student's needs. I don't know what to say to them sometimes or how to best care for them. My Biblical knowledge is definitely lacking, so it's often hard for me to answer their questions. I don't explain doctrine well, and I basically just don't explain my faith well at all. Maybe it stems from my Presbyterian background where faith is a very private thing....but I could be wrong. It could just be that the Holy Spirit is holding my tongue, or it could be that I just don't know. Whatever the case, please pray for me this weekend as I head to Jubilee and try to teach my students and push them to grow. I'm taking 28 of them, and it's going to be a handfull.

I'm also trying to work through a lot of my own issues. I come with baggage, whether I like to admit it or not. Sometimes, my clothes hang out of my baggage more than others. I am grateful to God for the ways He has healed me and grown me over the past few years, but every now and again, Satan shakes up my baggage and something falls out. So, please pray for me as I work through some of my issues, and as Satan tries to work against the good things I'm doing with SWAT.

On that note, I have a meeting with my SWAT leadership team right now, so I should probably be heading out. I may write more later, depending upon how much time I have. Hope you all are having a wonderful day!"

"event","Hi friends.  I know that blogging is supposed to be a free expression of myself and my experiences, but that doesn't mean I have to be so negative all the time...heck, you won't want to read it if all I do is complain!  So, here's my rescinding of the last post...I had access to a computer at the wrong time...while I was trying to process through some things.  I actually am doing quite well right now.

It snowed today.  It sure is beautiful here in the Mont Alto region.  I love living out here, even if I am homesick and Westminster sick.  I'm learning to balance my time between my ministry and hanging out with my students...time spent with church friends and time spent in building relationships.  It's tough, but it's good.  I think I'm having emotional growing pains! That's why things on here are bleak sometimes.  But God is good.  I had a great conversation with Shawn early, early Saturday morning/late Friday night about persecutions and my last post.  He said that my persecutions may not manifest themselves in the same manner as everyone else's.  This missing of my friends and going through growing pains thing could very well be my persecution.  

I have a ton of students signed up for Jubilee.  I am sooo super excited about it.  I can't wait to see what develops after Jubilee.  We had T-teams on Friday and we talked about evangelism.  I was really convicted about how I love people and how I love my students.  It's as much my ministry to love and care for my peers and my administrators as it is to minister to my students.  That's why I love my job.  It's about being faithful and true to other members of the human race and sharing the love of Christ with them, whether that be verbally or through my actions.  I am learning what it means to be faithful, and it's really cool all the things God is teaching me.  I am blessed to have folks in my life who call me out on things and help me to change and grow where I need to.

This is a really random post yet again...but it's all good.  I love coffeeshops.  I love the Frappe House, the Big Oak Cafe, Port City Java, The Ragged edge, and all the other cool places around here.  I think I could sniff a coffeehouse out within 200 miles.  The aforementioned are all in Chambersburg, Hagerstown, and Gettysburg.  Fair trade coffee rocks my socks, and the hyper brew that Sunoco sells makes me wired.  I love it.  Coffee, wine, cheese, and hanging out with folks are all my favorite things.

I went to see ""Brokeback Mountain"" on Saturday.  SO SAD!! It really wasn't just about the gay sex like some Christian groups make it out to be.  It was about relationships, love, being faithful, and family.  So sad to see two people so drawn to each other ripped apart because of society's perceptions.  Can't we just spread the love?  I dunno...it's not that I believe homosexuality is right.  I DEFINITELY believe that it is wrong and unhealthy.  But, I also believe that we should more that just tolerate folks who struggle.  I believe we should love them where they are, and accept them for the things they can't change about themselves.  What do you think?  I guess that's enough of a rant on that...

BALLROOM DANCING ROCKS! I'm so glad Shawn talked me into doing it!  It's a great way to make new friends from the area and to have fun! I trip over myself a lot, but Shawn and I just laugh, smile, and move on.  He's a great partner, in that he actually leads! Unlike most guys.  Anyway...I'm at Julie's right now.  We just finished watching Elizabethtown. Cute movie, cute Orlando Bloom, AMAZING MUSIC.  Rent it and let me know what you think.

Time to head out and fold my laundry! Love you folks and miss those of you I don't see often! *HUG*"

"event","Hi folks.  It's been a few days, so hold on to your seats because this is probably going to be a decently long, really random post.  Things have been NUTS!  I think I had the busiest week I've had for a really long time last week.  It's not necessarily that I had a lot to do...I was just very involved last week.  Anyway...

I was blessed in quite a few different ways last week.  First off, I got to go hear Brian McClaren speak in Ellicott City, MD with some City on the Hill folks.  It was different than I had expected, but a good time was had by all none-the-less.  Later on in the week, I was very encouraged by the CCO office staff.  My friend Becky, who is in charge of Jubilee, called me and told me what a great job they all think I'm doing when it comes to Jubilee recruiting.  I oftentimes have a hard time accepting positive feedback, but it was great to hear from these folks.  Then, Friday night I got to stay with my friends Jill and Steve who live near State College.  It was great to see their apartment, meet their turtle and some of their students, and catch up on a one to one basis.  Saturday night was awesome as well.  Julie did an amazing job planning Mont Alto's winter ball.  There were chocolate fountains, mocktails, and a really great video DJ.  So that was fun.  Sunday I was running on pure caffeine since I didn't get into bed until 2:30 am and then was at Salem church by 6:45.  But I was SOOO blessed on Sunday.  I helped lead worship at Salem, and the lady I lead with is amazing.  She has a son and daughter who are around my age, and she has been so welcoming to me.  She invited me to stay at her house on Saturday nights when I am going to be playing with the worship team on Sunday.  I love making connections like that!  So blessed!

STEELERS WON! WHAT A GREAT GAME!! HERE WE GO, STEELERS, HERE WE GO!  ONE FOR THE THUMB, BABY!  I had a great time Sunday night watching the game with some friends from City on hill church.  It was especially glorious to watch the game with a couple of Eagles fans.  We definitley did some good natured ribbing!  And of course I got to eat my favorite kind of potato chips that can only be bought in this area: Mrs. Gibble's! Hooray for potatoes fried in lard!

Monday night was awesome as well.  I had a tough time getting stuff done Monday, since I was coming down from the caffeine high.  But Lisa had me over for dinner with her family.  They have dogs, and Lisa is a wonderful cook.  I love fellowship, and I love the way God brings people into my life.  The community here is sooo awesome and so accepting.  Sometimes I feel almost as at home here as I do in Uniontown.  But I still get homesick sometimes!  This morning I babysat Lisa's daughter, Annaleigh (sp?).  She's cool.  It was definitely a good time hanging out with this highly intelligent 7 yr. old.

I suppose now is the time to explain to you the campus minister boo-boo I committed on Saturday.  I've come to terms with it now...it's still hard for me to extend grace to myself sometimes.  In an effort to be faithful to my ministry, and in believing that God truly does want us all to know Him through Christ, I gave in last semester and told one of my Muslim students that I would drive her to University Park (aka State College, a three hour drive from Mont Alto) this semester.  She wanted to meet with the Muslim Student Association president up there to find out more information about the organization.  I was cool with that, until this past Friday afternoon, when things began to sour.  I couldn't find directions, and she had made a comment about just going up to see the campus and being disappointed that we weren't spending more time there.  I was pretty ticked, and my patience was wearing thin.  But I held my temper, and let it slide.  I should have known better.  Crappy things come in threes, and Saturday I definitely was the third to be hit by Satan from Mont Alto.  My student was half an hour late for being picked up; I had turned off my engine to save gas and was listening to the radio.  The battery went dead and I thought I'd killed my car.  I was pretty sure I wasn't going to make it back to MA on time for the formal.  After about 2 hours of frustration, I ended up going to Advance Auto and dropping $60 on a new battery.  Praise Jesus it wasn't the alternator.  Needless to say, I was pretty angry at myself and the world in general.  When I get upset, I don't talk and my mind goes 900 miles a minute.  So I didn't talk to my student for the first 1.5 hours of the drive.  I guess I wasn't the best witness in the world, but oh well.  God does His work in spite of our meager, weak, sinful efforts.  So, as you can tell, the Blessings out weigh the Boo-boos by leaps and bounds. (I'm feeling a bit alliterative today, can you tell?)

Overall, the boo-boo wasn't that bad.  And I'm cool with it now.  It's awesome to have new friends here at Mont Alto that support me through the crappy times!

So I've also been musing on beginnings lately.  At first, if you were to look at my old journal entries, it was pretty hard for me to live out here.  The transition was really tough, coming from such a tight knit group of friends and such an amazing college and campus ministry community to nothingness.  I was really worried that things wouldn't work out here.  But God is soooo good! And I've learned so much about leaning on Him for all my needs.  I'm definitely still learning, but it's getting a little bit easier.  I can't imagine leaving this community behind.  I love working with campus and with the churches in the area.  Hopefully, the gospel of Christ is being shared at least a little bit through me.  I've really been blessed to see the blossoming of the ministry on this campus and the growth of the students here.  I don't know what God has in store for next year, but I'm okay with that.  I look forward to continuing to build relationships in the area and letting God take the reins.  I think that's about it for now...hope you all are well! Congratulations Michelle on the new baby!  *HUGS TO YOU ALL*"

"event","Don't you just hate those mornings when you wake up in a crappy mood and not feeling so hot?  I am so emotional today...and I wasn't doing much better yesterday...so this is kind of a carryover mood...I have a splitting headache and my stomach is upset as well...I probably should have stayed home from work today, but I knew I had lots of things to do, and I knew I needed to be here to support some of my co-workers.  I'm hanging in there, I suppose.

Yesterday was my day off, and I was excited about spending time with Shawn and going to see a movie...however, I started off the day in a tired, anxious, kind of crappy mood.  I had talked to some friends, and they were going through some tough things.  It's hard for me to not be able to care for my friends when they are hurting...hard to be so far away.  I am realizing slowly how long it took for me to build the relationships that I had at Westminster...and how important those relationships really were to me.  Right now, I just want someone to rub my shoulders, stroke my hair, and spend some time with me.  I am a very physical person...where that came from I don't know...but I miss hugs and cuddling and sisterhood stuff...but anyways...

I've been thinking lately about gratitude.  Do I express my thanks often enough to God for all that He has given me?  Am I satisfied and thankful for all that I have?  I think sometimes I am too selfish and too self-centered to really appreciate what I have.  I have a wonderful family, and beautiful sister, and an amazing system of friends from Westminster and CCO and Mont Alto...but I still am not satisfied.  I too often forget to call these people, stay in touch, or show them that I love them.  I try, don't get me wrong, but I've been realizing lately that I am blessed, and I have been given much, so I should be more grateful.  What do you think?

I am still struggling with pessimism.  I am working hard to overcome it, but sometimes the black clouds just creep in and all I can see is negatives.  My prayer and devotional life continues to struggle off and on...and I continue to wonder if I should have it more under control than I did when I was in college.  It hasn't changed all that much, even though being a Christian and being faithful is my JOB nowadays.  But I'm plugging along...please keep praying for me.

I'm starting to get scared about Jubilee.  Some drama has occured already...about roommate situations...I can only hope and pray that it is all okay in the end.  I can't believe how many students I am taking, and how much responsibility goes along with that.  Sometimes I wonder if these students know what they are getting themselves into...

I also wonder if I'm sharing the gospel enough...do my students see Jesus in me?  What makes me different from any other staff member or student for that matter?  We're working on this...I do my best to live a faithful life...I slip up sometimes...and it's harder now that I am under constant observation...but I know that God is moving SOMEHOW on this campus...not because of me, but IN SPITE of me.  Anyway, I think that's about it for now...I'm gonna head out and read some and then help get ready for the poker tournie tonight....later folks! *hug*"

"event","Things on campus are insane...I currently have, counting Abby and myself, 27 STUDENTS! Going to Jubilee...God is too good to me....and I am done.  I am finished registering students.  I quit.  As Dan said at Staff Sem, if you feel like it's time to quit, quit.  Especially if you feel like if it flops your ministry is doomed.  That's definitely how I feel right now! But God works in crazy ways...so this could be a great chance to help my fellowship bond!

I went and heard Brian McClaren speak to Emergent Baltimore last night.  It was awesome.  I really would like to sit and pick the guys brain.  And it helps when you go with people whose company you enjoy.  It was a blast riding down with Shawn and Jodie.  And Matt and his wife are a blast as well.  Matt intimidates me sometimes, but that's okay.  He challenges me to think in ways I wouldn't normally think.  It's good times.  And McClaren has a new book coming out soon on the KINGDOM! WoOt!  Hooray for someone whose thinking aligns with the CCO!

I met with my area director and the community board on Friday.  Wonderful folks.  They really want to see my ministry succeed and they really want to do what's best for the students.  It's awesome.  And Jim brought his 150 English Mastiff with him.  Can't beat a walk in the Mont Alto woods with the big dog! Woohoo!

I'm going to the movies to see ""Walk the Line"" tomorrow with Shawn.  Pretty excited about it.  He and I have had some good conversations lately, and I like hanging out with him.  And we get to be dance partners on Friday!  The movie's going to be a break before mad craziness...between the formal Saturday night, taking Dakkar to UP, and watching the Superbowl Sunday, I'm going to be wooped come Monday morning! But it'll be okay.  Don't worry folks...I'll make sure to post how my first ballroom dancing class goes!  I think that's about it for now....nothing intellectual at the moment...we'll see if anything comes up in the near future!  Miss you all!"

"event","We had staff seminar last week...it was intense, both intellectually and spiritually.  I loved it! It was great to see all of my co-workers, to hang out with my roommates, and to laugh uncontrollably.  God is good.

While I was at Staff Seminar, my cousin Gina had her baby.  He was 9lbs. 9ounces, and had to be taken C-section.  Craziness.  It's weird to me that my only 1st counsin now has a baby...and that many of my friends are either engaged, married, or on their way to having babies as well! It's nuts.  But the best part is what Gina named her baby....Jake Kasimir (pronounced like cashmere)....go figure.  We are not ethnic at all...and it's not Jacob...it's Jake.  Kasimir was a name that the dad apparently wanted to name his son, but Gina wouldn't let it be the first name.  Good move.  She only conceded in making it the middle name because it means ""bringer of blessings"" or something like that.  Anyway...enough musings on that.

I'm on busy girl! There are now 24!! COUNT THEM, TWENTY FOUR! Students registered for Jubilee from Penn State Mont Alto...insanity.  I am feeling okay now though, because my friend Abby is coming along to the conference....she can help me chaperone and she can drive!  God is too good to me! I should give things over to Him more often! I'd definitely be more fruitful! How funny is it that I go from hating Jubilee to mildly disliking it to loving it to taking 24 students to it!  It's sheer insanity....and so goes the life of a campus minister...

I've also joined a ballroom dancing class! Thanks Shawn for talking me into it! And thanks Miss Alisa Locke for giving me the courage to do it!  I needed to meet people....so tired of being lonely!  It takes place on Fridays from 6-7 at the area VoTech....can't beat it!  Super excited to learn all about dancing...and what better excuse to dance with some guys?  Should be a good time...

Well, that's about all for now...gonna go head out and have coffee with a student from church...I love the Frappe House! It's my favorite place to go!  Blessings to you all...have a great week!"

"event","So, I'm pondering again...we all know that this can mean trouble.  I've had a hard time transitioning into this semester for some reason or another, and I'm struggling with several different things.  Staff Seminar takes place at the end of this week, and we were challenged to think through the following:

What personal issues might the Lord want to transform in you (either sick things that need to die or weak things that need to live or be born)?  What hurts, is hard, is frustrating, is fearful, is a barrier to your work? What things do you know are right to do, but you don't want to do for your supervisor or coop? What seems like oppressive suffering on campus? What beautiful things would you like to grow into?

At January Staff Seminar, you will have an opportunity bring all of this, the thorns and thistles, the beautiful things that you would like to grow into, the hard, frustrating, challenging parts of your work and lay them at the cross in worship. 

This is quite a lot.  I've chosen to only focus on a few things, but I am struggling through others as well.  Why is legalism so rampant among the Christians on my campus and what can I do to combat it?  Why do I have such a good relationship with some students and others go running like I'm the plague when they see me?  Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration.  But there are definitely students who do not see eye to eye with me and do not want to spend one on one time with me for fear I'll challenge them.  What do I do about that?

I'm also struggling with support raising and committment.  How much and what do I need to do to be doing my job well?  I hate to compare myself to other campus ministers...but sometimes I wonder if I even know where to begin forming this ministry.  It's almost like an identity crisis.

I guess I need to learn more about Grace.  Giving grace to myself, and accepting the Grace freely given to me.  But is there going to be grace extended by my community board? by my area director?  I really don't know.  I guess right now I'm at a crossroads.   I'm  having a hard time envisioning what I want to see happen on my campus, and the look of the ministry is changing somewhat.  I am not who I once was, but what does that mean for my students?  How can I use what I know to share the gospel of Christ?  Shoot, I'm so different now some of my friends from college probably wouldn't even recognize me.  This is turning into a long blog post yet again...could I be in need of a journal that I actually like to write in?  Is that why my posts on here are so long?  

Anyway...I'll leave you with one thing to ponder through on your own...
Where does your identity come from and who are you?  What does this mean for how you live your life?  Thoughts on this are welcome..."

"event","So, apparently being an oddball is a continuing theme in my life...let me explain. This is probably going to be a long post again...here goes!

Upon returning to school, my home group studied Numbers 13 and 14...you know, 10 were bad, 2 were good? Automatically, the passage brought to mind for me how hard it must have been for Caleb and Joshua to serve God and to go against the masses. They were oddballs in their faith. They knew God personally, saw Him in their lives, and heard Him speak. While the masses were threatening to stone them and find new leaders, Joshua and Caleb tore their clothes in despair over the lack of faith of their nation. But here's the clincher: not only did my homegroup study this passage, but Marlin also preached on it on Sunday. I asked him about it afterwards, and he said he had planned the sermon before he had read the home group passage. So here are some of the insights and good quotes that I gained from Marlin's sermon.

The first point he made was in regards to our point of view. He asked us, ""What do you see for 2006? A cluster of grapes or a pack of giants?"". Now let me clarify. If you are familiar with Numbers, you know that 12 men from the tribes went to investigate the promised land. They found that it was indeed ""flowing with milk and honey""; however, there were also giants there...descendants of Anak...the men, other than Joshua and Caleb, said that they were like ""grasshoppers in the eyes of these giants."" Now, what was so different about Caleb and Joshua that they would look on the bright side instead of the dark side? They had faith. They believed their God would deliver them into the promised land, no matter who He had to defeat along the way. So, here's the insight I gained. I need to change my point of view for 2006. I do have a tendency to be a pessimist...and it's not healthy. When I am pessimist, I choose to be intimidated by Satan. I CHOOSE NOT TO BE A GRASSHOPPER! My God can do anything, and I need to remember that more frequently. I will not allow support raising and other difficult circumstances to overcome me, but I will pray and allow God to take control of the situation. GOD CAN DO IT!

Here's another insight...Marlin told this story about a little boy trying to get a big rock out of his sandbox. He has exhausted his resources, and not succeeded. Suddenly he sees a shadow. It is his father. He explains the situation to dear old dad, telling him that he has done all that he could. Dad proceeds to tell his son that he did not do all that he could; he didn't ask his Father for help. So, what I take away from that is that I need to not be prideful in asking for help, whether that be from my Heavenly Father or from the people around me. It's so hard sometimes to see where I need help, and when I should ask for it. So that's something I am going to work on this year...and I know that my FATHER, MY GOD, will help me in my time of need if I ask.

I need to spend more time in prayer this semester/year/in general...I feel so much better when my prayer life is healthy. It's tough when I am not praying enough! Another insight Marlin offered was that of the Bumblebee. According to him, Honeybees defy physics. If a bumblebee were to obey physics, it would not be able to fly. It's wings would not be able to bear the weight of it's body and food. But somehow, the bee manages to fly, and quickly at that. God knows how it works, even though we don't. I need to fly with God and let Him handle things instead of trying to do it all on my own.

I hate the word pessimism. One author defined a pessimist as ""someone who complains about the noise when opportunity knocks."" I need to not be like this. I need to rise to the challenge and run from the attitude that I can't do things. God is in control. It'll be okay. I also need to remember that ""if there is no risk, then there is no growth."" My day to day life is a big risk...but I still play it safe on lots of things. What would it mean for me to just spread my wings and do stuff...whether it fails or succeeds? It's hard for me, because I am a perfectionist...but what can you do? I guess we all have our weaknesses.

One last insight from Marlin...and then I'm done for now...I promise. This insight was crazy, because it definitely directly applied to me. He compared vultures and hummingbirds. Do you know what my birdname was while I worked at New England Camp Cherith? Hummer. Short for Hummingbird. Here's what he had to say about the two birds. When a vulture is searching for food, all it sees is death and despair. It eats dead animals and leftovers from what other creatures left behind. When a vulture flies over a desert, it doesn't look for the good things; it looks for those which death has overtaken. But a hummingbird does just the opposite. A hummingbird looks for life in the bright, beautiful blooms of the cactus plants. The hummingbird looks for abundance despite the dryness of the desert. It flits from flower to flower, sustaining itself and the life of the cactus as it goes. Instead of bringing death, it brings life. I should be like a hummingbird. I should find the postive, bright spots in every situation, no matter how bleak it might appear. God is good, and He will provide, so why be stressed out? I have to remind myself of this every day. No matter how gray I might feel...a bright spot will come.

Anyway, thanks for reading...please keep me in your prayers as I venture to achieve this new outlook on life. Take care, all of you! *hug*"

"event","First of all, I want to wish all of you a very Happy, Healthy, Blessed New Year! Welcome to 2006! And I am definitely up way too late to be posting right now...don't believe blog time, I'm still figuring this thing out...I actually posted at 2:38 am...but oh well...BRACE YOURSELF...this may be a long post, and an attempt at being intellectual...;)

So, I'm awake because I just finished watching ""Crash."" What an AMAZING, THOUGHT PROVOKING movie. I had watched it before with my office mates, but we hadn't had time to talk through it. I watched it again tonight with my parents (or at least my mom...my dad left halfway through the movie...but that's a story for another time). I think I could watch that movie over and over again and still find valuable things in it. I have a different favorite scene each time! Here's the quote that opens the movie, spoken by Don Cheedle as Graham:

""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""

I love this quote. But the ironic thing is that what Cheedle's character is saying is pertinent to anywhere. The plot of this movie could take place from Pittsburgh, PA to New York City to LA to just about anywhere you want to go. We all put ourselves behind glass...we wall ourselves away from humanity in order to protect ourselves, our culture, our children, whatever. But in reality, all we are doing is hurting ourselves. When we don't take the time to get to know one another, to learn one another's stories, then we miss out. We fear people who are different from us, we become prejudiced, and we create reasons to fight. As the quote says, ""...we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" So many people in this world are so afraid to love, afraid to listen, and afraid to care that they create stereotypes and prejudices to create a reason for conflict. Heck, feeling conflict, rage, anger, and hate is better than nothing, right? Another favorite scene of mine is when Sandra Bullock's character has fallen down the stairs and is embraced and cared for by her HISPANIC HOUSEKEEPER. Bullock's character comes to realize that just because someone doesn't speak English as well as she might like, may not make $80,000+ a year, or looks different from her, doesn't mean that they can't be friends. This particular character's ""cultural bubble"" is shattered when she realizes that her good friend of 10 years is a shallow bitch, and that that is probably what she has become as well. I love it. Overall, this is a very tenderhearted movie, despite the violence, anger, and swear words. There is so much value in the message...and I think the fact that it was even produced makes this world a little bit better of a place. But we have a long way to go. I don't know about you, but I'm going to commit to spending a little more time getting to know those around me whose culture might be a little different...instead of letting my fear paralyze me and shut me out.

On that note, I have another thing I've been pondering through the past day or two...I'm an oddball. Not that I didn't know this before, but I've realized in just the past 24 hours that I am not an oddball because of who I am. I am an oddball because of WHOSE I am. Sometimes I lament the fact that I met Christ and He has changed the way I think about things. It makes life ALOT more difficult sometimes! But nobody ever said that ""taking up my cross and following Christ"" would be easy. In fact, I think that Christ said Himself that we would be denied in our own hometowns and that we must leave the dead to bury the dead...and that we must leave our families behind. Such a hard concept to understand! Yet, in a way I understand sometimes. It is hard for me to go home to my parent's house. They don't think that my campus ministry job is a real job...I beg for my paycheck. I don't care too much about possessions...I don't care about how much money I make. Yes, I have a college degree, and no I may not be teaching. But that's okay. God has called me to a place where I belong. And just within the past 12 hours I've come to realize that it is only ONLY when I rest in God that I am secure and happy. Through all the transitions, through all the change, through all the heartache when it comes to dealing with family and to being the oddball...and God is right there alongside me, knowing my heart, knowing my experiences, and loving me just the same. He comforts me and dries my tears...and knows the longings and desires of my heart. It's scary sometimes! It was a song that made all of this apparent to me...it's really a beautiful prayer...here it is:

""Amidst the sorrows of the way,
Lord Jesus teach my soul to pray,
Let me taste Thy special Grace,
And run to Christ, My Hiding Place.
You know the vileness of my heart,
So prone to act the rebel's part,
And when you veil your lovely face,
How can I find a hiding place?
Lord, guide my wandering feet,
Draw me to Thy mercy seat.
I've naught to trust but sovereign Grace,
Thou only art my Hiding Place.
How unstable is my heart,
Sometimes I take the tempter's part.
And slight the tokens of Thy Grace,
And seem to want no Hiding Place.
But when Thy spirit shines within,
makes me feel the plague of sin.
And how I long to see Thy face,
'tis then I want a Hiding Place.
Lord Jesus, shine, and then I can
Feel sweetness in Salvation's plan,
And as a sinner plead for grace.
Christ, the sinner's HIDING PLACE,
and as a sinner plead for GRACE.
CHRIST, THE SINNER'S HIDING PLACE!
--original words by Daniel Herbert, music by Jars of Clay
from the album titled ""Redemption Songs""

Anyway, that song just reminds me how far away I stray from God sometimes, even though I am working to further His kingdom every day. I am by no means perfect, and that's okay. It's hard being a campus minister somtimes! But it is when I go to Christ, and allow Him to be my Hiding place, that I find TRUE GRACE, TRUE PEACE, TRUE LOVE, TRUE FORGIVENESS....and all of my brokenness, sinfullness, fraility, and failures make no difference. I am a Beloved, Forgiven, Found Child of God. Amen and Amen."

"event","Times change...and change is hard. Let me try to not be pessimistic in this little post...but I'll also be honest. Coming home was hard. I miss my folks from Mont Alto, and my folks from Westminster...but even Westminster is weird anymore. I don't know why, but transitions are hard for me, and they are especially hard when I don't have anything to occupy my time. At least at Mont Alto, I had so much stuff to do that I couldn't focus on figuring out what the heck my relationship with my family now is supposed to look like.

Not that that is particularly a good thing either. I definitely had to deal with the family thing when I got home from Mont Alto. My sister is now a senior in highschool...graduates in June and is going to California University of PA in the fall. She's had a serious boyfriend for 3 years, and is really close with my mom. Not that I'm not close with my mom. We just have an odd relationship. Anyway, she has a job now...first time since she got pregnant with me almost 23 years ago. Now she's tired all the time, not home during the day, and usually cranky...it's weird. Definitely an adjustment for the whole family. So, needless to say, that has made life interesting since I've been home.

My dad's uncle died Christmas weekend. Dad was always really close with Uncle Mimi even though he lived far away. One of the only family vacations we have ever had was to visit him in Sault Ste. Marie Michigan. He lived on Sugar Island. But see, here's the interesting twist to the funeral. Uncle Mimi has been living in Las Vegas with his family for the past, 5-7 years. His family, my cousins, haven't been back to visit since I was like 6 or 7. He has two grandsons: Michael, 24, and Teddy, 22 (I'm from April to August older than Teddy.). Last time they were in, the four of us played and played like we'd never been apart. The same was true this time...man, did we have a good time! Despite being really sad over Uncle Mimi's death, we celebrated his life by going out drinking after the viewing on Tuesday. My 18yr old sister was the DD....we drove all over Uniontown trying to find a place to drink, eat and hang out. By 2 o'clock in the morning when we got home, Teddy was tanked, I was not exactly sober, and we had had a blast. 

It was sad to see them leave for home yesterday. I know my dad enjoyed having them in visiting, despite the occasion, because they are his only family members who treat him okay. Dad is very unlike the rest of his family. They are all very greedy and self centered. Sitting in the Serbian church yesterday, I felt like I was sitting behind a brood of vipers. But that's a whole other story. My poor daddy...I hate to see him upset and crying. Uncle Mimi was the last of all of his mother's brothers and sisters...the last one who could tell him stories about his mom and dad...who grew up across the street from one another....and died when my dad was 17 and 19. And seeing how his family treats him was like sticking a knife in me...my dad's first cousin...handed out flowers to all of the cousins, including my dad's brother and sister...to put in the casket. She didn't give one to my dad. It hurts him. And it's hard for me to be here and around this bitterness...I am a strong believer in forgiveness, grace and love...and these people claim to be Christians as well...it's no wonder my dad wants nothing to do with church. Anyway, life has been interesting the past few days...I think that's about all I have to say on that note.

Happier things! My parent's 25th wedding annivesary takes place this March. So, I'm scheming. I want to do something nice for them because they never had a honeymoon, wedding reception, big wedding, or engagement rings. I want to send them to Las Vegas. My cousin Dana (Uncle Mimi's youngest daughter) is some sort of big wig with Hooters, and she has a grand opening on February 2nd. I know it's a little early, but I really would love to send them out for the opening and to stay with the family. They are always welcome there, and Dana said they have a place to stay...since she has two houses! So, we're working on that, my sister and I. If you have any ideas as to how to get cheap tickets...let me know. I am not a very seasoned traveler...so tips would be good! Anyway, please be in your prayers about that. Thanks!

I also want to have a party for them that brings together all of their old friends and people who have good memories with them...but that's gonna be hard...my mom is pretty smart! She figures stuff out! And it would take family cooperation...we shall see!

Well, I'm gonna head out for now...watching Shrek 2 with my sister! Hope you have a great day and talk to you soon!"

No more cheesy Aslan costume and underpaid, low-budget, crappy actors!

Anyway, Julie and I really enjoyed a good day of shopping, going to the movies, and doing laundry...I am definitely going to go through Mont Alto withdrawal when I go home! Julie is ready to go home, she says...but for me, it's hard going back.  I love my family, but there is this balance, you know?  You have to build community in the new places where you land...and I'm beginning to do that well here...

I met with Joe the CCCI guy Friday night for a mock support raising meeting with his parents, and it ended up being a real support raising meeting! His parents (my landlords) are going to support me at $25 a month! How awesome is that?  And Joe is a great guy...too bad he's leaving for Florida on the 8th and Ghana for nine months not too long after that! But who knows?  I've really decided to not worry about the guy thing...it just causes me too much grief.  I want a guy to court me, and to ask me out...not the other way around.  So I guess I'm content just going with the flow!!  God will provide.

So, how many of you have odd vices?  One of my vices is definitely Sex and the City...not because I enjoy looking at women's breasts or hearing people swear, but because it is soooo incredibly funny! I don't know anyone who would live like the women on the show...so it's funny.  Some of the things they say are just nuts...and the reasons they pick guys are definitely shallow...maybe that's why I like it...cause it's definitely not real life.  Anyway, thoughts?

Another thing...what do you all think about self-esteem? being overweight?  For me, I am content with who I am, and with my identity in Christ. That's where I find the strength to love who I am, whether or not I am overweight.  Yes, my body is my temple, but we all have our sins...and maybe one of mine is just eating too much.  But that's okay....because God loves me!  Why do I ask this question?  Because I have been having a hard time talking to one of my friends who is definitely way too concerned with how she looks...she doesn't want to dress up or be around people when she feels fat or like she's been eating too much or like her clothes don't fit...granted, we all have those days....however....her eating habits fluctuate and it worries me...so what do you think?  What brings us to that point where we are comfortable with who we are?

Thanks friends! Good times pondering with you! Look forward to hearing your thoughts!

I may not be posting as frequently here in the near future...my internet access will be sporadic while I am at home....we'll see...so if I don't post beforehand...MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!! GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND REMEMBER THAT JESUS IS THE REASON FOR THE SEASON! *HUGS*"

So, there are 22-23 students registered for Jubilee as of now....I'm scared! I am by no means an authoritarian...so hopefully they stay out of trouble...I just want them to have a good time and to really catch the vision of what it means to live every day to the Glory of God...and to incorporate their faith into every aspect of their lives....we'll see.

Ever have one of those gifts that is a blessing and a curse at the same time?  Oftentimes, I do things impulsively and in a rash manner...sometimes this is good...it's me following God's spirit...other times, it's bad...it's me being stupid and not thinking through what I'm doing...all I can see is my dad, veins pulsing, red-faced...pounding his fist on his head and yelling through clenched teeth, ""why don't you just use your head?""....so, yeah, another thing is my innocence/ignorance to certain things....sometimes I am just so naive and out of the loop that it's dangerous...other times its good and allows me to be an example of purity to my students...I don't know...what do you think?  Do you have any of those gifts that are blessings and curses?

Another thing I'm realizing is that this transitions thing is hard...I am NOTHING like my parents...I have their values and their ideals, but that's about it...we never went to, nor were we even invited to, Christmas parties....I've had three in the past two weeks...it's crazy.  I don't know how to interact...I don't know how to make things....I just rely on my conversational skills, which only go so far...especially when I'm uncomfortable...because I tend to use the gift that is more the curse at those points and say stupid things....anyway....thoughts on transitioning and changing from what your parents are like?

"event","Wow....can I just tell you that pondering through the past, oh, three or four days has been intense and crazy? Let's see...where to begin...

Well, first off...(there we go with the ellipses again...I gotta learn to cut back!) Libby posed an interesting question to me on Wednesday night before I headed off to Staff seminar. I had asked her to help me work through whether or not I was supposed to drop the grad program that CCO offers. She asked me whether I thought I would use the degree in the future, and I said I didn't know. Then she asked me what my dreams for the future are. It was like a slap on the face. I came to the realization that I really don't have any dreams...yes, I have those seven things that I posted on my blog recently, but those are life goals or anything. So, any thoughts? I'm still trying to let God lead me and give me some dreams.

Then, on Thursday morning (way too early...we left at 7am) I carpooled with Phil to Staff seminar. We had some good chats along the way, and then when we got to Antiochian village, it was great to see everyone and to hear the keynote speaker for the weekend give a brief introduction to we new folks. However, it was there that the discernment process began. When Chris White gave back our Bible studies from the summer, I was very disappointed with mine. I got a C. Granted, I didn't put as much work into it as I should have, but still...I am not a C student. So, it was after this that I began to think about grad school stuff. I basically had a breakdown in the chapel after evening meeting. Rosemary prayed for me, I prayed intensely, and I journaled a good bit. Through that I decided that I would not be doing the grad program at this point. Grades have become an idol to me. I want to be able to study for the sake of studying, not because I am worried about getting the grade. I chose to do the grad program for the wrong reason...to please and appease my parents. And until I start making decisions for myself...I will not be truly free and able to serve God. So, that's that.

I also was struggling with summer stuff..that's a story for later....as is the discipleship house story....more on that later...and more on the amazing Staff Seminar speaker and on my weekend....whew! Lots to write about! God is too good to me!! Later folks!"

So many of you folks have cool links, links to other friend's pages...and other neat things on your site...help! I don't do technology too well...any advice/direction/teaching would be appreciated!

Right now, my homework assignment for my AD is to reflect on my semester's ministry plan tools and to begin planning for next semester....it's tough! It was good for me today to print out all of my ministry plans and prepare to look over them...it helped me to see all the things that I have achieved.  Wow...I like ellipses way too much!  I think I've learned and grown a lot this semester...and I still have a long way to go.  I cannot believe how quickly God has moved among my students and on my campus...He has been opening doors left and right for me since I first got here in August.  I can't wait to see all the things He is going to do throughout my three year stint (or maybe longer?) with the CCO. 

We have staff seminar this weekend and I have mixed feelings.  I love seeing everyone and I love learning, however I don't really feel like talking about all the things I've been doing on campus and all the things I've struggled with this semester.  I don't want to give the superficial ""I'm good"" answer, but I also don't feel like pouring out my soul to twenty zillion different folks.  So we shall see.  I guess I need to pray that God changes my heart about going this week.  I am carpooling with Phil, so that should be a good time, and I am also excited to see Byron.  I love the book guy!  Plus, this specific staff seminar is geared directly towards an issue I have recently become passionate about: RACIAL RECONCILIATION! I had no idea when I set foot on campus that I would connect with all of the minority students.  It's exciting to see how God uses this White Anglo Saxon Protestant who went to one of the whitest colleges around reach out to the african american and Muslim students at Mont Alto.  It's really cool.

Anyway, that's probably enough pondering for the time being...I still have some other stuff I am thinking through at the moment, but I have a splitting headache, so we're gonna hold those thoughts till later.  Until then, enjoy this tough little quiz that has been posted around my circle of friends lately....who knows? You might learn something new about me!

-Speak Serbian
-Drive a stick shift
-Cook well (I'm still learning)
-Play any sort of athletic sport (other than archery or riflery)
-Crochet (I don't have the patience for it!)

3. Seven things that attract me to (my spouse or significant other or best friend)
-Trustworthiness
-honesty
-humility
-faith
-compassion
-passion

-as well
-Later
-see you around
-Blast (in place of  not so nice words)
-Lemme be (aka Pittsburgh-ese for ""Leave me alone"" when someone is picking on you)

5. Seven books (or series) I love
Well, we all know I was an English major...therefore, I LOVE BOOKS! (Note that these are all fun, fiction books....if you want to know the serious, intellectual type books I read...ask me)
-Harry Potter series
-Lord of the Rings Series
-Narnia Series
-Eragon
-Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants
-Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood
-The Secret Life of Bees

6. Seven movies I watch over and over again (or would watch over and over if I had the time).
-Hitch
-Sweet Home Alabama
-Something's gotta give
-The Lion King
-Sex and the City series (they're on VHS...I suppose it counts...and this is one of my vices...it makes me laugh really really hard!)
-The Wedding Singer
-The Dead Poet's Society
(yet again, I do like some serious, intellectual movies...just ask...I prefer watching comedies though...it's more fun to analyze them and it's always good to laugh!)

And so as to keep things balanced....since there wasn't a seventh question...I'm making one up!
7. Seven Events in your life that have made you who you are...
-Going to Pine Springs Camp and learning about Christ
-Joining Kappa Delta Sorority
-Going to Westminster College
-Working at Camp Cherith in Maine for 2 summers (instead of Pine Springs...good story...ask me sometime...God is good and faithful!)
-Doing Ocean City Beach Project
-Choosing to join CCO staff and moving to Penn State Mont Alto area
-Sharing a room with my little sister (she's 5 yrs younger.)"

"event","Amy Maczuzak posted this on one of her blogs earlier this semester...and I totally agree...here's how she ends the blog:

""Ministry is about leaving the harbor and taking the risk of sailing into choppy waters...and trusting that the One who can walk on water will be right there, keeping me safe and doing the real work of ministry--softening hearts and changing lives.""

I could not agree with that statement more...this has been an INTERESTING semester...let me tell you.  You want to go on an emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual roller coaster, go into campus ministry.  God is always there alongside you and keeping you held into the seat, but let me tell you, it's one heck of a ride!  It's more thrilling that the praying mantis at Cedar Point...and you just might want to get off more quickly!  But God is in control...if I told you how many times I just wanted to give up this semester, and God brought someone into my life to cheer me up, to encourage me, to put me back on track...you probably wouldn't believe me...but God is good...and He cares for us in so many ways...

I was in tears more than once in the past two days...but I took yesterday as a real day off...journaled, went to a coffee shop...went to home group...took a LONG nap...and I am really refreshed today...amazing what a real day off can do for you and for your faith.  

Some crazy things have happened this semester...and I am definitely at the point where fatigue could feasibly set in...but I won't let it...because unless I am rested and ready to go, God can't do His work...please pray for me as I try to finish up the semester, plan for Jubilee, and get my support up to where it needs to be...right now I am only at 20%...little bit crazy, but I can get it up...Cami the support raising guru is going to help...I had to humble myself...but it'll work out.  Anyway, please pray for me! I'll talk to you all soon!"

"event","So, isn't it funny how perceptions of things change as you get older?  I am currently sitting at Mugsie's in New Wilmington...and feeling like a foreigner...it's weird being back.  Granted, I still have friends here and folks who are like family here...but it's still weird to see lots of people who I don't know wandering around...

It's also odd how relationships change.  Some of the sisters I was closest with before I graduated are like strangers now.  It's hard being an adult.  I have to support raise, and I have a big girl job.  I don't have time to go out and get trashed every night, nor would I even desire to if I could.  I dunno...it's weird only wanting to hang out with my friends who are already graduated adults...everyone else is still too much like one of my students...transitions are hard.

I've been reflecting a lot lately.  My ministry is a wonderful one, but it's draining...I run out of energy by 10 at night anymore...I asked Morgan this weekend why that is, and she said its because we as campus ministers use more energy that we are aware of...and I wouldn't disagree.  I am always doing something, and I am always praying for my students and trying to think through how I can best help them grow.  It's tough!  

This weekend was encouraging as well as discouraging.  I am at Westminster until Thursday morning.  I got here last Friday night.  I have yet to have a solid supporter meeting....I feel like a failure because I didn't plan this trip out better.  I am continually reminded that I am a rookie and am totally still learning things.  But God is good and God is gracious.  My students are patient with me, my area director is patient with me, and my friends are patient with me.  And my students give me room to mess up.  But it's hard to try to challenge them when most of them are not letting me close yet.  What can I do?  Hard to tell...but Morgan says second year is better.  And I wouldn't disagree.  I can see that she is a much happier person and much more in her element now than she was a year ago.  And we are much closer now.  I feel like I can talk to her, and I feel like she wants to talk with me.  Granted, some of the stuff she says still frustrates me, but maybe that's because she challenges me.  I love her.  And I look forward to this time next year when we can get together and talk about all the other victories God has gained on my campus and how things have changed.  I know Mont Alto is where I belong...but I feel like a hobo sometimes...no, not a hobbit, a hobo.  But we're working on that.  I have three homes...mont alto, uniontown pa, and westminster....one day, they will all be consolidated....or one will rise to the top as home.  Transitions are hard.

Sorry for the morbid post....I've had too much time to ponder things lately.  Anyway...God bless you all and thanks for all of your encouragement...please pray for me as I continue on this wonderful ambiguous journey called campus ministry...it's wild to let God just take the reigns....thanks Kids...more later!"

"event","Hi all! GOD IS GOOD! I asked the Student Activities Fee Board for $1500 on Monday to go towards 25 students going to Jubilee conference in February....and I GOT IT!  Money is tight around here, and it is quite the unexpected blessing to get this much! PRAISE GOD!

Now I just have to do the work to get students registered and to get churches to provide families to sponsor students the other $60...lots of work, but doable...

Please pray for me that this support raising trip I am doing will go well...and that it is the right thing for me to be doing right now...I'm torn...I'm not sure all the time that it is the right thing...I feel like I've had training so many times in the past two months...and been away from my students so much that it's been hard for me to be visible...do I hide in my office? Or am I doing things that are actually productive?  This campus ministry thing is so ambiguous sometimes...

I went to see Jarhead with one of my PSU co-workers last night...it was quite intense, moving, and thought provoking...go see it if you have the chance...then we came back and dyed her hair brown...it was good times...

I am in an odd mood right now...it's bittersweet for me to be leaving my students...I feel like a mother hen leaving her chicks...am I going for selfish reasons or is this what I am really supposed to be doing?  I've prayed about it alot...I hope that I am hearing what God is saying in the right way....but please pray for me!

We have staff development tonight....all of us from the campus life office (even me, even though I'm not technically employed by Penn State) are going over to Linda's house to watch ""Crash"" and eat chinese food.  Should be a good time...despite the strange mood I am in...I still think it's really cool how I get included on things here...it makes me feel good to be able to bond with staff and feel like they really want me to bond with them.  Still, doubt creeps in.  Am I spending too much time with fellow staff members and not enough time with my students?  I'm mentoring three students right now...and advising two student organizations...I am a member of BSU...and I am trying to coordinate Jubilee and all kinds of other community church oriented things....I guess I do more than I think....I am definitely too hard on myself sometimes.  PATIENCE IS HARD! I know that the first time I meet a student we aren't going to engage in a super deep conversation...but how long should I wait before I challenge them?  This is my current dilemna...so, enough pondering for the moment...I may not be posting for a while because I am unsure what computer access is going to look like the in next week or so...blessings friends and please keep praying for me and my ministry! Hope you all are well!"

Sorry for that last post....sometimes I just need to vent, and it's really hard when you only have your coworkers to vent to....so, I put it in writing here on the net....thanks for the very, very encouraging responses....I am so glad that I have sisters and friends I can count on!

Anyway, things got better after lunch.  I went to lunch with Kelly, the RC of Mont Alto hall, and we cheered each other up a bit.  I know I can trust her, and I am pretty sure she trusts me.  She's a cool girl.

After lunch I went down to the sand volleyball courts with some of my students.  It was nice just to hang out with the leaders of SWAT and play volleyball.  They are crazy kids!  And really really funny sometimes...they just need to learn how to balance the fun and the serious!  But it's all good...everything comes with time and patience.

I am home now...it's kind of bittersweet, but it's nice.  I went to my cousin's  baby shower today.  Wow has her boyfriend changed! He looks a lot different than he did several years ago when I saw him last! I just hope he treats her well...anyway.  She got lots of really cool baby things, and I think I may have picked up a few potential supporters.  God is good.  After the party, we came home, I took a nap and my sister left for another party.  Then we ordered pizza from Pizza hut and rented ""Batman begins.""  I still think that it and the original batman movie are the best.  I've seen it plenty of times...this is probably the fourth or fifth, and I still like it.

I think I might be getting sick...not fun.  But hopefully it's just allergies.  I'm going to take a bath tonight and relax.  Makes me quite excited!  Read a little, relax a little, and head off to bed.

Tomorrow is an important day at church.  We haven't had a pastor for about 4 years, and finally someone has demonstrated interest.  We are hearing her preach tomorrow and then voting on her.  Hopefully, she'll be the right one!  So, you can keep that in your prayers.  BONUS: Covered dish luncheon! Second one in two weeks! Yeah buddy!

Please pray for my Monday...it's going to be VERY long.  There are lots of important things going on...I'm meeting with a student that intimidates me to talk about some stuff, meeting with my area director and community board, and attending the Student Activities Fee meeting.  It is going to be a long day.  I think in the evening I am just going to unwind and watch a chick flick.  But especially, please pray for the SAF meeting.  I asked for $1500 so that 25 of my students can go to Jubilee at as little cost as possible.  Please pray that things work out.  Anyway...enough rambling.  Hope you all are having a wonderful day! *HUGE HUGS TO YOU ALL*"

"event","I need to vent...please bear with me...
We had our fellowship last night...it wasn't bad...but sometimes I wonder why I am in this profession...I love my students and I do love what I do....but am I doing what I am supposed to be doing or am I just hanging out?  Do I have enough values and morals that I am a role model for my students?  Am I too worried about looking like a hypocrite or a Bible thumper or stuck up or ultra conservative?  And then there's the other end of the spectrum...

Students are bundle full of surprises and challenges....a student was meeting with me yesterday and we were talking about our leadership team and fellowship...and you know what she said to me?  She said she was worried about what her peers were going to be teaching others about their faith.  She said that faith has to go through testing and that it's good to have zeal and passion, but that we must also have patience...and study the word and find answers before we try to teach people.  We must encounter the Bible ourselves before we try to teach others about it.  I don't know that I fully agree...but maybe that's because I am still not as good at knowing where things are in the Bible.  She also posed the question as to what they would say if someone asked the other students why they believe what they do.  Yes, they would have all the Bible verses as answers...but do they have a real, true, deep belief and knowledge of the love of God?  And how would they share it?  The question for me is, am I playing with fire?  Am I just playing at this campus minister thing and pretending I know what I'm doing?  Obviously God saw something in me and called me here...obviously the CCO thinks I am capable...but sometimes I feel like the things I said in both of my interviews were lies....well, maybe not lies, but maybe more of things that I pretended to be confident in...and right now, it makes me nervous when I have students who are stronger Biblically in their faith than I am...I have a hard time finding the words to say to them to challenge them...sorry...I went off on a tangent...This has really been on my heart since yesterday...

And last night at SWAT (that's our Bible study/fellowship) I was stunned by how ""churchy"" the answers were to questions....I am struck again by the idea Brandie brought up to me this summer...many of us have the head knowledge about who Christ is and who God is....but do we have the heart knowledge?  I liked the guy that spoke last night...but he did frustrate me at certain points.  Yes, faith can be black and white on some issues, but we also must be willing to meet sinners where they are in order to teach them and show them that we love them.  If my students can spit out all the ""churchy"" answers, why can't they answer ""squirrel"" once in a while and think about things a little differently?  I know deep down that this job is what I am supposed to be doing because I love caring for people and reaching out to them...but it's been really stressful for me to work with some of the Christian students who think they have all the answers...or who are stagnant and don't want to grow and push themselves...what the heck did Joy do for me or say to me that clicked and caused me to change?  I have no clue. So, I'm kind of at a standstill...I think next week at our leadership meeting I am going to do the Jenga block activity....make the students really start thinking about what encounters they have had with God that make them stay true to what they believe...that causes them to know that they are beloved children of God....and that makes them want to share their joy with their peers...anyway, enough on that...

So I wasn't feeling well yesterday...I thought I was feeling better when I went to bed at 10 and crashed...but no.  This morning I still feel pretty physically and emotionally crappy...I read my Bible this morning and it helped calm me down some...but listen to this.  I think I lost my bank card.  Not a good thing.  Just when you begin to feel like you are an adult and responsible, you lose important things or something like this happens.  So, I was stressing out about that when my landlord's wife calls me.  Let me give you a little background information.  My hot water tank has been only allowing me to have like 4 mins of hot water in the shower. Now, being the steward and OCBP person that I am, I don't take overly long showers...you're talking to the girl who shut off the water in the dorm showers when she felt like she was wasting too much!  So, it's not like I go stand in my bedroom and talk on the phone and leave my shower running.  Which is exactly what my landlord accused me of doing.  I wasn't even going to say anything to him about it not working....but I figured since I'm paying rent, maybe he should check it out in case it is busted.  So, he came over yesterday with the plumber and checked it out.  And this morning my landlord's wife calls me and tells me that ""there is nothing wrong with your water heater.  Maybe you need to rethink the way you are using your water.  Like, you wouldn't leave it running and go talk on the phone in your bedroom.""  LIVID! What am I, a two year old that plays with the faucet?  No! I honestly do watch how much water I use.  And really, is it reasonable for me to only take military showers?  You would think not.  But I guess my landlord is not a reasonable person.  So, on top of losing my bank card and not feeling well, my landlord's wife pissed me off by accusing me of being irresponsible in my use of water.  Grrrr! I didn't even know what to say to her.  This bathtub/shower thing is going to be the BANE OF MY EXISTENCE!! It has been trouble since I moved in....grr...I know the rent is cheap and they are giving me  a break...but come on now...I really don't think I want to live here next year.  My landlords are nice enough, but I hate living alone, and the place is like a freakin' hole in the wall.  I guess I should be appreciative of what I do have...but I am not comfortable there....it's a flat.  I feel like I can't express myself there... I have no space to have students over...basically, it stinks.  Anyway, enough of a rant on that...I suppose this is why I need to get my support up...so I can move to a better apartment.  

Well, I think I have processed enough for the moment...I may be posting again in the near future.  I am going home today after work...hooray for a 3 hour drive...and for gas money...but at least I'll get to see family and to go to Gina's baby shower....

Sorry this was such a negative post...I think Satan is attacking...damn minions!!  Please keep me in your prayers...many blessings friends!"

"event","So, I've been thinking alot lately about being single...and wishing I wasn't.  All my friends here come in couples, and it's tough for me to not have anyone to hang out with on the weekends....I didn't really date all through college...and I think I'm ready...but what do I want?  I think that my friend Michelle put it best in her blog...so I'm ganking it and putting it on my livejournal and xanga...here goes:

In short, a woman should consider exploring a relationship with a man who loves her a little bit more than she loves him. Then she should marry him when he asks her. Because he will.

Okay, that might be quite the statement. Maybe even a little bit controversial. But I've hashed it out with some friends and relatives of mine, and I'm sticking with it. Don't hear me wrong. I'm not saying a woman should marry a man she doesn't love. I'm suggesting that the man who might make a woman the happiest in the long run is the man who is devoted to her, cares about her well-being, puts her needs ahead of his own, wants no other woman but her, praises her to his friends and colleagues, esteems her value, realizes his life is richer, better, because she is in it. Believe me, you will know the man. He is usually not the handsomest or coolest guy in the crowd. But that doesn't mean you won't find him attractive. He will be a man who keeps his word. But that doesn't mean he won't mess up sometimes. He's upfront with you about where he is and what his feelings are. He's probably the 'good guy', not the thug, not the hustler, not the ""bad boy"" who sends our emotions reeling in a whirlwind of mountainous excitement. He's not the one we need to rescue. We will not be this man's savior.

We may be slow to recognize him at first because he doesn't send our emotions zooming like that other guy. We'll almost write him off, if we're not careful. But like I told my friend recently, all we have are our choices. That's all we have. We can make good ones or we can make bad ones. We can make choices based on our emotions alone, or we can make choices based on sound reasoning and good judgement. And as I spoke with my friend, I told her it wasn't just about the man who makes her feel good now. It's about choosing a man who will be committed to her in the long run. Who will be the best husband to her? Who will stand by her side if she is sick and cannot care for herself? Even with good choices, there are no guarantees, but it's still good to make them. We all take our chances. But if we are to struggle and suffer, it's better to struggle inside of the will of God than outside of it. Trust me. And think of it. It's not that we loved God first, but that He first loved us. And in response to His love for us, we love Him.

Yeah, so that's how I'm feeling about the whole dating things right now...I don't want to rush it...but it would be nice to have someone to cuddle with and to appreciate me...and to appreciate in return....pondering, pondering..."

"event","Hi friends....sorry about that last sort of pathetic installment in my journal...it was somewhat of a rough day...I don't know if I posted it on LJ, but it is posted at Xanga....

Things have improved...yesterday was a good time.  I went to Messiah for Training...and then I went to the Kappa Delta Central PA Alumnae Association's Founder's day dinner....those ladies were a hoot! I can't wait to get to know them better! Dinner was a little pricier than I would have liked, but it was good just to have fun and fellowship with some sisters.  It's hard not having people who understand Kappa Delta and CCO around...but I had people who understood both last night...it was fun!

Training was good and frustrating at the same time.  I got to see Becky's house, and I got to talk to Drew and the Bensons a lot....but it was also a frustrating day in that I didn't really want to be there...I would rather have been with my students.  And there is also a certain staff member who kind of clings to me....and she is quite negative.....it's hard to have her around sometimes...but I hung in there.  I miss spending time with Brandie and with my Westminny friends....I hope to catch up with some of them soon.  Support raising is going better...things are slowly picking up.  I love my grandma and how well she takes care of me! And how the people who you don't expect to support you, support you more than you'd have ever dreamed. 

Well, I should probably head out... I need to go home and make dinner...but I think this coffee shop may become my regular hang out.  It had a great wireless connection and is not too far away at all!  Hope you all are well...please keep in touch! Love you!"

I have to plan the trip to Jubilee...both funding-wise and promotion wise....it's way too much to do without a committee, but at this point I don't really have a choice.  This whole pioneering thing is HARD!  

I also just thought I was getting a handle on PMing CCO stuff and on my support raising when I was thrown for the loop of some final details needing planned for tonight's meeting...I am also really scared by all the things my students are bringing up.  I love the two of them who are on fire, but they are beginning to get into Revelations and they want to share with their peers what they are finding...but I find that kind of scary....I don't think I am going to allow them to share just yet because it is such a tough book to understand.  

We're also leading the service at Manor care this Sunday...I am worried that it is not going to go well...and that we are going to look stupid...I trust that it will turn out okay because God is in control...I just am feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment....

The other thing that is worrying me is finding pastors to do the Sunday night services for this month...I know God provides and I just have to make the phone calls...but I am nervous...and I feel really busy...

I also want to plan a dessert auction to help defray the costs of Jubilee just a bit.  I have yet to talk through this with any of the congregations that support me....I just want my students to be able to go! And I am worried SAF is not going to give me any money because Andrea hates me....why do I have such a hard time dealing with her?  Please pray for me...I am stressing at the moment and kind of tired...didn't sleep particularly well last night and all day tomorrow is going to be long...it starts off really early because I have T-teams in Grantham...I am longing for Saturday when I can have my Sabbath and get refocused....God is good and in control...I just have to keep telling my self that over and over and over again....and breathing....take care friends."

It is quite nice to be able to have a day just for myself, to refocus and get back to where I need to be in my relationship with God and in my rest.  I am currently sitting in Julie's apartment waiting for my laundry to dry...using her computer...and making myself at home.  It's been a lonely day...because noone is around since yesterday was fall study day.  Things have been good though.  I had about 6 students over for dinner last night, and then we came back to campus and played games all night while Miley was on duty.  Alex and I won Trivial Pursuit! It was a good time.  There were 44 students at SWAT on Thursday...it was wicked awesome.  God is really moving on campus.  It's awesome...but as I was saying...today was lonely.

I really miss my Westminny friends...having someone readily available on the weekends to go out for sushi with....go to the movies with...rent a movie...go get a beer...whatever....it's tough that everyone around here is either a student or in a relationship...the people from church are awesome....but it takes soooo much energy and patience to form new relationships....so hard.  But I love it here...even though it's lonely.  I think I may be taking myself out for sushi in Gettysburg in order to celebrate Sweetest day.  I am getting pretty tired of being single and not having the nerve to approach the guy on whom I have a crush about hanging out...I really think he's good looking and a solid guy....but the hormones play a role as well...I have to be careful not to get myself too attached...too quickly....or to get physical with him too fast...we all konw how those relationships have ended in the past.  I am trying to be careful, but also to be courageous.  I know things will happen when they are supposed to happen...but he's an older guy...and I would really like to just get to know him better to see if we could date.  *sigh* I just miss having someone to cuddle with...to talk to...and to simply go out to eat with.  I miss being able to just go...and to pay for whatever it is I want...but I guess I'm not living for myself anymore...anyway.  I miss my girlfriends...and I'm still learning how to have guy friends...and I really would like a boyfriend...so I can learn how to have a romantic relationship.  I also miss having someone reliable to hang out with every weekend...everyone here, as I've said, is either in a relationship or a student...or both, for Pete's sake! Anyways....enough whining for now...I have to go finish my laundry...go home, and change....then it'll be time for some sushi! Hope you all are having a great weekend! Miss you and love you!"

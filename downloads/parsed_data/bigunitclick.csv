"event","I've noticed that over the past couple of years of my life that I've wanted to be normal because of my disablity I Tylor Evans wanted to be everyone else to be different and my recent surgurys have changed that view from the day I was born I have been different by all means I should not even be here!!! I realized last night That I flatlined at birth and then I died on the operation table during my hip sugury!! I have lost friends my homie Nick pass away trying to be the hero tried to save his dads girlfriend life the house fire engulfed the house and he made it to the door TO THE DOOR!!! and the roof fell on him and he burned to death an other homie Seth Bailey died because his girl dumped him he went to the look out and drank and pass out suffocated because he had a tube in his throat and he needed oxygen he died in his sleep

my question is Why!! they had a reason and didn't live to see it, and yet I lived and yet I feel I've accomplished what was needed I've spoke for people who couldn't, heard for the deaf, and seen for the blind, moved for the motionless,

and yet what now?

people remember for those less fortunate than you because if you don't people won't remember you"

"event","Finally!!! a place where I can post my thoughts, ideas, belief's, and what not and noooo one can tell me I'm crazy. Anyway my name is Tylor, and I've had a lot of sh!t happen recently. I've had surgery on my hips and ankle but don't feel bad. Anyone that knows me will tell you I'm not worried about it, and that I'm usually hard headed, but that's just me. Anyway hopefully you all will welcome me into this deal and W/E. 

Peace all!!!!"

Considering <s>nearly</s> everyone has faced the spring time of their lives, I am stuck here brooding for a boyfriend wondering what it's like to fall in love. I'm into those romance stories these days, like 'Sloppy Fists' <s>that is filled with swear words</s> and it makes me want to fall in love. 'Princess Diaries' is an <i>excellent</i> book, too.

But anyway. I am accepting ivitations from boys. :D



P.S. But then again, being with Macchi is fun. o_o I want to cook with her again. xD"

"event","...I can explain. Really. It's not my fault. Ok, so maybe I did miss a few <s>weeks</s> days of school, but there was nothing I could do about it. It's actually the belgian waffles fault. Which I'll explain soon.

I switched on the lounge public TV, and I came up with a channal doing a tour around the recent EXPO, aka Ai-Chikyuuhaku aka Banpaku. I was just watching it, going, 'Hm, so many people...'

...And then they showed the belgian waffles.

They were the most delicious looking things I'd ever laid eyes on. It even looked better then the melon buns we had back in Hokkaido. And so I decided that we should all go to the EXPO before they tore it down in August or September or whenever it was. Of course, we'd all gone to the amusement park, but hey, the EXPO is a once in a life time, isn't it? :3 <s>And so are the belgian waffles.</s>

Since you needed to line up in a really long line to get in, I thought I'd go and get an advance ticket for all of us so we could enter the moment the park would open. Plus, it would be a good surprise for everyone, wouldn't it, even after the amusement park thing. You can never have enough fun. ^_^

It all went well, lining up for 2 hours for a bunch of those advance tickets. They cost a LOT, even though they were high schooler prices. Which isn't that cheaper then the adults, but it's a difference at least. And then all hell broke loose.

I lost my ticket back to Funbari. Really. So there I was, ticketless and empty pocketed. I tried to convince the station staff to let me in, but they flat out refused. Maybe it was because I had blue hair. :/ The station dude was eyeing my hair with really great distaste. Discrimination against the naturally blue! >o

It was late, so I ended up sleeping in the corner of the station like some homeless person and I was kicked out in the morning after being prodded by an evil looking KIOSK staff. I was just resting! >o The other KIOSK cashier gave me a really symphathetic, though, and sneaked me a free bean-jam bun, which was actually kind of humilaiting. Did I look that bad? ._.

It took me 3 days to hitch a ride out on the highway. Everyone practically ran over me when I waved at them. Mean people! >o The car someone finally had stopped for me had a very scary driver in it, but I didn't really have anything to lose, did I? So I rode it, told him to take me to Funbari... and I somehow ended somewhere up in Aomori. o_o Apparently he mistaked it as some other 'Funbari Gakuen', and he kicked me out saying that he was in a real hurry now.

It took me <i>another</i> 4 days to hitch a ride back to Funbari. Or at least somewhere in Tokyo. But that person only took me back to Aichi, in exchange for 2 of my EXPO tickets. ._. Back at Aichi, I needed to find a way to go back to Funbari- so I had to sell all my EXPO tickets to passerbys for 1000 yen less to buy a superexpress ticket back home. I don't know why I didn't think of that earlier. Although it was quite saddening to see those tickets I'd lined up for 2 hours go.

I got lost at Tokyo station again, and here I am now, with these old dirty clothes and ragged hairband. I managed to save just 2 EXPO tickets- but what's the use if there are only 2? *sigh* I think I'll go and take a shower now..."

"event","I dragged Macchi to the ice cream store today. :D Just the two of us, since oniichan and Tamao seemed a bit preoccupied, and Meene was doing her make-up work. The cashier looked really unhappy when he saw me in his store again. xD Especially when Macchi asked for pumpkin ice cream, which they evidently didn't have. So, since they didn't have it, we bought one of those Vanilla ice cream packs and a pumpkin from Heiyu. (Not because the cashier kicked us out the moment we asked for pumpkin. -cough-) We borrowed the school kitchen...

All in all, it was a wonderful day, not counting the blender incident with the pumpkin bits flying all over the place and hitting Yoh in the face when he walked in. >_< Sorry Yoh!"

We are, too, but I guess we should leave the two in their own lovey-dovey land. Ok, it's decided, we shall go to Tokio Nezumiland this weekend! ^_^ Spread the word, people!

Oh... and we'll go out for ice cream tomorrow after school, too. The one with the scary cashier. Must take Macchi with me..."

"event","I haven't seen much of oniichan these days. ;_; And I just thought of something... if he's saving up for a skateboard, where is the money coming from? o_O Could he be working at McDonalds or something? Because our parents don't give us much allowances... just enough for ice creams and maybe a movie.

I was thinking, maybe we should have a party. Since some people seem to find school boring. o.o; Which I can see. I mean, there's not much except for the occasional pillow fights and using-Manta-for-a-soccerball thing. We never had a Welcome party, did we...? We should have a party with ice cream and chips and <s>spiked</s> punch and a lot of food. And music. Although where we could have a party at, I have no idea..."

"event","Well what do you know... we finally did go out for ice cream. ^_^ Me, Lyserg, Tamao, and oniichan went out. I got Mint Chocolate... but I would have loved Melon Ice Cream. Or better yet, Melon Buns. ^_^ But Ice Cream is good, so I don't mind. I tripped and fell on someone holding my ice cream, and it splattered all over the stranger, though. ;_; Mint Chocolate Ice Cream all over the place... But all ended well cause oniichan paid for another ice cream for me... hehe. Thanks oniichan! <3

Oh yeah, I found out yet again how... um, mean Marco-sensei is. Apparently Macchi is starting a cult. We shall all join and burn all of his maths tests! (But wait... then oniichan can't get that A on the math tests, can he?)"

"event","Well, guess what? I did go run off to the mall by myself... and I found myself in Karuizawa via superexpress train, where there are still tons of snow. Not tons, but still a bit of snow left. And there was a ski resort right in front of the station... how could I resist? I rented a snowboard, got a lift ticket, and snowboarded a bit. (I don't even want to think about how much the rental bills cost) After snowboarding, I went to this huge outlet/mall thingy and bought a bunch of clothes... (I don't want to think about the bills I'll probably be getting soon, either)

I felt a bit guilty about snowboarding by myself, so to apologize to oniichan, I will agree for you to get a skateboard. Yep, you can go buy a skateboard, oniichan! ^_^ I bought a bunch of those Japan famous milk pudding things for everyone, too. *passes them around* Since I did go to Karuizawa by myself...

Did Lyserg and Tamao and oniichan go out for ice cream already...? I want to go if I can too. ^_^"

I also realized that my roommate is STILL not here. It's getting even lonelier... Maybe I'll move into oniichan's room. But his room will probably be one big mess... so maybe I'll go see if Tamao-chan would let me in. o_o"

I think I'll go treat myself to some white chocolate I smuggled in... I'm sure food is allowed in the dorms, right? (I haven't seen any of those Rules posters, come to think of it...)"

But it's okay, right...? Since I didn't get my homework, or my textbook. I think. Faust-sensei isn't even my teacher! I've never had detention in my whole entire life... I don't want to ruin my record! *wails*

Anyway... I heard the music teacher and the PE teacher are having some kind of affair, and that's why they aren't coming. T_T But that's only a rumour, so I don't know whether to believe it or not. There's also this other rumour about the music/PE teacher, of how they are actually married, or how the PE teacher is the Music teachers servant, or how the PE teacher is actually a talking corpse.

T_T

That is just so scary. Oh well. I will be looking forward to meeting more teachers... (not really, just to see if the rumours are true)"

"event","I witnessed something majorly scary yesterday. Marco-sensei was yelling at someone (I forgot his name...) at the hall, and then he got a little too mad and his glasses shattered. o.o; Seriously, he was like, 'WHAT?' and then bam, those glasses exploded into a million shards. I'm actually worried if he didn't go blind because of those shards. o.o;

I just realized that we actually have homework for Earth Science from oniichan... hope I won't have to do it. I mean, I did come late... So let's just tell Faust-sensei that I never knew.:o

P.E is getting really boring... I mean, we have no balls, or anything else used for sports. (They all miraculously disappeared from the toolshed. o.o;) I heard a bit of music coming from the music room. I'm beginning to wish that I took music instead of P.E... although Hao is sometimes really amusing to watch."

"event","Since we don't really have any really classes except for Physical Science (because most of the teachers are still MIA...) we have this studyhall type of thing instead. Well, not really. You don't have to participate or anything. I think. Anyway, during the time we were supposed to have P.E, we all decided that we should try and play some kind of sport. (Where in the world is that Pailon-sensei, anyway?) So all of us P.E-ers went out to the basketball court... only to find that someone had stolen all the basketballs from the tool shed. -_-; So we had to give up playing basketball.

Hao wanted to go kidnap Manta or something from the library and use him as a basketball, or maybe a soccerball. Macchi-san wasn't much of a help, just watching and laughing as Hao tried to go back to the library. Oniichan didn't help, either, till I gave him a good kick from behind. Even that didn't make him want to help the Manta guy. Yoh managed to stop him in the end, though, so all ends well.

There is still no sign of my roommate... *sigh* At least I think I made some friends. Like Tamao-san. Were going to be sisters someday!=D"

World History - because there is much more to learn about the world. I mean, you have to admit, Funbari must have only a small bit of history. 
Earth Science - I cannot stand disecting things. Or look at blood. *squirms* <s>And Faust sensei creeps me out a bit, too.</s>
Algebra - So I can stalk my dear brother. =D
P.E. - I heard the teacher's a 'scary dude who looks sorta gray'. That must be interesting.

Oh yeah, my new roommate is apparently someone called Ino Zria... I wonder what sort of girl she is? She isn't here now, hope she comes soon!=)

But it's still lonely here in my big room all alone. Maybe I'll go and see who my neighbors are...

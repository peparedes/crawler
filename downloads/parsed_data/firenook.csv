<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Robot</B></FONT><BR>You are 57% Rational, 28% Extroverted, 14% Brutal, and 28% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Robot! You are characterized by your rationality. In fact, this is really ALL you are characterized by. Like a cold, heartless machine, you are so logical and unemotional that you scarcely seem human. For instance, you are very humble and don't bother thinking of your own interests, you are very gentle and lack emotion, and you are also very introverted and introspective. You may have noticed that these traits are just as applicable to your laptop as they are to a human being. In short, your personality defect is that you don't really HAVE a personality. You are one of those annoying, super-logical people that never gets upset or flustered. Unless, of course, you short circuit. 
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more RATIONAL than intuitive. 
<P>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I>

<P>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=0&score3=0"">Hand-Raiser</A>, the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=0&score1=0&score2=0&score3=0"">Emo Kid</A>, and the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=0&score2=0&score3=100"">Haughty Intellectual</A>.

<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits.</I>

"event","Hello, everyone. Sorry I haven't written but I have been busy. Also I haven't really had anything to write about that was interesting or worth putting in writing. Well Now I do. Here are some tips on how not to piss off a Walmart associate or if you want to, go ahead and use these wonderful tips.

1. If you've had a prepaid phone (TracFone, Virgin Mobile) for several months and need minutes added onto the phone, do it yourself and don't ask the associate to do it for you. Only ignore this tip only if this is the first time that you have done this and need some pointers on it. After the first time, you SHOULD know how to this. Especially if it's your own phone and have been shown how to do this. The process of adding minutes can actually from 5 to 10 minutes to do especially if the owner of the phone doesn't know any of the passwords or numbers. 

2. If you want a video game and ask the associate to get one for you, think carefully about how you ask the question before asking. Do not say,""Excuse me. There is a game I would to get and I don't have the key to open it myself. Can I get the key from you?"" No, the assoicate will not give you or another person the key. You would not believe how many times that an assoicate is asked that question.

3. Do not ever check out about two carts/buggies worth of groceries in electronics. That department is not equipped to handle THAT much of groceries. Imagine only having to bag racks to fill bags in, so that every time that both bags are filled more time is needed to take the bags off and start over. Very time consuming and aggravating. 

Well that's all for now. More will follow.

I love you Leita."

"event","Well, my car hunting may have come to an end.... or maybe not. I'm not too sure at this moment. In the midst of trying to buy a vehicle of my own, I ran across a flyer for Crown Ford for people who have bad credit or bankruptcies on their record. I decided to to with Erica in tow with me as moral support so that I wouldn't try to whimp out of it or something. We got there and spent probably a good six or seven hours looking at cars, test driving and finally sitting down  with some paper work to see what they can do. By the way, the vehicle that I finally decided on was a 05 Ford Focus SE SX4, which is very nice indeed :-D Any way. Well basically people at the dealership told me that I was able to actually get the car but they had to work some things out with their loan department and told me to come back the next day. In the process of this, I was able to take the vehicle with me to test drive for 24 hours. Much joy even though I've had several friends trying to drive it and I had to refuse outright about it. Oh well. Well I brought it back the next day and they tell me that I would most likely need a cosigner for the loan. So against what probably really aggravated me in the upmost way, I called my family and asked my mom to cosign for me. She actually told me that she would do it. Let's just say, it was possibly the most shocked I have ever seen Erica when it comes to my mother. My mom actually tells me to go ahead and trade in the contour also (even though I doubt they would take it. I supposedly have a friend who wants it for $800 or $900. Who knows. Maybe I could turn a better profit that way since it could go towards the down payment. :-D I would have to look into it. 

But after telling me this, the people at the dealership told me to continue driving the vehicle until Saturday and to see if anything comes up with the loan. Well Saturday comes and we both go to the dealership once again. They tell us that they are having trouble trying to get it approved and there might be a possiblity of it not going through despite the assurances that they gave me the first two days of talking with them. It makes no sense for it to take this long to get this thing done. But they were at least able to appraise the contour and told me that it would be less than 1500. So basically they will TRY to fit it into the deal, maybe. And again, I get to drive the car some more on Sunday and Monday. Yes I do love driving this new car but I'm getting tired of putting gas into a car that I'm not even sure that I'm getting, by the way these people at Crown Ford are talking the deal. I just feel alittle uncomfortable about it. But it's like what the guy said at the dealership, ""The worst that could happen is that I got a free rental car"" even though this is sort of really wasting alot of time. But this is an investment. I must keep this in mind.

Lately I have been sick due to my friend Erin and now Erica has it too. I'm so sorry that I gave it to her but I guess it's one of those things that you can't control. But I feel bad mainly because she has to study for her midterms and well....she really needs to study for it and I just want her to do really well about it. All that I hope for her that it's just a cold and that's it. I don't want sickness preventing her from doing well on the exams. 

Lastly I would like to close this with a few thoughts or ponderings. It feels good going through the car buying process because it really makes me feel like something is going on. Something is really getting done and everything. I mean I have been at Carmax and Chevy looking for a vehicle but at Ford , I have felt like something is being accomplished. Even if I don't get this car, I will walk away with some experience of what is going on with the car buying thing. I feel more accomplished and it makes me feel happy. I would like to thank Erica for enduring all of the time that I used of hers in trying to get this car. She had to sit through my endless ranting and stupid jokes. Even though she 's not my girlfriend, I still love her like one. She makes me happy inside and out. She makes me feel like that I can actually tackle alot of things in this world. I don't want to think about it but I have to just in case but I cannot guarantee that she would take me back. But I know at least she showed me the door that I have to past through to get ahead in life. I just have to get the gumption to actually walk through it. Yes I miss Erica and everything, but I'm starting to function without her at times. I have spend the past several days enjoying each other's company even though I was probably trying her patience on Saturday. I enjoyed every minute that we talked about things and stuff. When I left her house last night after eating some Buffalo Wild wings food, I felt like there was a vaccuum that had sucked out the part of me that was happy. I mean I was still happy due to the car process and I was actually getting something done but it just felt like something was missing. I know Erica wants time for me to 'develop' but I still miss her and well ..... the feeling is still there. ::small smile:: Well I better get going then. And Erica, sorry again for the cold."

"event","Hello, hello. I haven't really been writing lately because of two things. First of all, it has been my job that has kept me from making a good entry in time. every night I have been working to close, it has been really working until 12, 1 or two. so by the time I get home, I don't really want to do anything but read or sleep. Lately, I have been just sleeping. I probably need some vitamins in my diet because I have been so tired lately and I don't know why. My second excuse has been that I haven't had much to say about how I feel and for some odd reason I hate having to bore people with what I do during the day. It's very weird since this is a journal and you're supposed to write things like about your day and what not. 

well, where shall I begin? What I have been up to lately? Well other than work and school, I have been on the lookout for a vehicle of my own and even a new job. The car hunt does not go so well because of how much I make at Walmart. Both carmax and reed lallier chevrolet have rejected me because of how much I get paid. So basically I'll have to go to lesser car dealerships in order to find a vehicle for myself. In conjunction with this car hunt, I'm looking for a job that will pay me more than what Walmart is paying me. It's a good hourly pay but recently it has not been cutting the cheese, if you know what I mean. So basically both hunts continue. 

Well lately, I have seen abit of Erica and well... our relationship isn't as it was before. It has been I guess you could say, a friends with benefits type of thing. The sex has been very good and rejuvenating. It's just simply great and it just really been allowing me to do alot more things with Erica. I'm guessing I'm just trying to show the type of lover that I am. I don't know what it is but it's just great. She is extremely great in bed and I cannot stress this enough. But I still want to be with her once more but I have to keep on working on my objectives that I must work on. I love her with all of my heart and I do hopefully want to be married to her. Hell, I'm thinking about having kids and what not. I don't know why I want kids but that's how I feel about it. I want to actually have kids with Erica and go through all the good and bad times of those times.  

Another thing that I have been working on has been my models, especially the painting aspect of them. Recently Erica got me a model of Anakin Skywalker's podracer and I decided to paint it. Well after spending about 30 dollars in paints and supplies, I have finally started on it and I realize one thing about this. Just like how long it takes to build a model, it takes about twice as long to paint it, especially piece by piece. Oh well, with great care and patience, it will be done and maybe I'll post a picture of it sometime;-) I just love this model building. Now I just need to find a star trek model that I paint and build, something like the Entereprise D or E, or even voyager ;-) 

Well I better get going then. Bye bye people and see you on the flip side."

"event","Hello all. Sorry I haven't been on but I have been busy with work and other things  that go on with this life. I have been working quite a bit at my job since it's the holidays. I guess it helps getting the mind off of things for awhile. Hopefully for tonight though, I hope to be home on time for the new year's countdown. There are no special plans because most of everybody already have plans. Oh well. Just means I can go to sleep on time or something. 

Let's go through the Leita situation one more time for good measure. I miss her but now that we are ""broken up"" and just friends, I have been trying very hard to realize the fact that we are that. It's so hard to kick a habit especially when you know it's the most right thing to do. That is when you really love someone and you want to show it. But in this situation it is not going to happen because of our relationship status. I just miss her (Here comes the whining) and I just want to be with her. I don't know. Right now I'm just trying to get things in my life straight so that maybe, just maybe I can be a better person on my own, then maybe I can be with Leita once more. I just hope that I will get that chance once more to do so. I just hope for a sign or indication that this will be so. 

Another thing is how I have been trying to handle the situation. I was trying too hard to see if I can be with Leita again by showing that I really do care about her but I overdid it. ::doh!!!:: I did alot of things but it just blew up in my face. All I got in return is a cold stare that made me feel like that I was really nothing in her eyes but just an acquaintence. Those eyes seem liked that they were uncaring and it hurt like hell. I really did deserve it alot especially since the way I was treating her in the past few months leading to the break up. I was almost the same way towards her. It seemed like that I didn't show a lick of real interest and that is how Leita felt. Then really I do deserve this punishment , this torture of the heart and soul. A taste of my own medicine. I know it will probably pass one day but it seems that today or tomorrow or the day afterwards will not be the time that comes. All I can do now is try to redeem myself by doing the things that I need to do in order to make things right in my life and possibly my dating life. I've got to do the things I have to do or this will happen again in my next relationship with Leita or anyone else if it comes to that. Courage. I just hope that I will recognize the progress I make in this investment of my life. 

Well to sort of update, I'm still looking into a car right now. A friend of Leita's is trying to help me with this while I too have been looking into it. Right now I""m looking at the vehicles at carmax and I hope to pull off something there. I'm looking at a few Saturn SL1 series cars and even gone through the insurance for it through Geico. Surprisely, the insurance there has been cheap considering that it's Geico. All I need now is the funds for such a venture but I have to wait for said funds. Time, little grasshopper, patience is a virtue. Or so they say. So I'm basically waiting for the necessary funds for it. Perhaps by the time I get my refund check from school. Hmmm....;-). Down payment!!

Speaking of refund, I will be taking only two classes this semester because I'm really burned out from School. I don't want to disenroll (not drop out in other words) because then it would be harder to get back. So I'm taking fewer classes so that I don't feel like that I'm overdoing it like I did back last semester. This would put me at around December 05. better late than never at least. This will hopefully give me time to look for a job involving my field of study. Maybe if I can get a foot in the door at least I'll have a chance to get a new job after or during college that pays alot better. One can hope. 

Well I need to get going but if anyone wants to know, here is my work schedule for the next two weeks. Enjoy. Jan. 1 - Jan. 7 (Sat. 2 - 11, Sun. 7 - 4, Mon. 5 - 11, Wed. 6 - 11, Fri. 6 - 11) Jan. 8 - Jan. 14 (Sat. 10 - 7, Sun 7- 4, Mon. 5 - 11, Wed. 5 - 11, Fri. 5 - 11) If anyone who has my number wants to hang out, well just contact me and we'll see what we can do."

"event","Hello, Happy Holidays to all. And to all a good night. I just wanted to write about something that has crossed my mind as I woke up. Allow me to share but here's a fair warning, if you don't want to hear me rant about Leita and Christmas well, just go to someone's elses journal. 

For the past three Christmas holidays, I have spent them away from the one I love the most, Leita. Two of those reasons was because I was in Germany with my family and the one reason was because I was in El Paso Texas....with my family. Being with your family during Christmas is good but the thing is that me and Leita never really spent a Christmas together. Or even be with her family for dinner. But this year, there are problems. 

First we are really separated or broken and we are not obligated to see each other for such a meeting. Since because of that condition, we can't really see each other. Though we have seen each other the other day but it's not the same as seeing each other. Secondly, her mother is not too particulary fond of me at the moment. I don't think her mom would really like to see me at the moment because of the things that have been going on. I also think that she will not talk to me unless I have answers for some her questions that she aske me the last time we talked. About marraige and what not to her daughter. And thirdly, plus Leita needs her space. She said she needed time and space to think while I figure out my stuff for myself. At the moment, my heart tells me to fuck space, get her back, you idiot!!"" but my brain tells me that I need to try to respect her wishes on it. I can't rush this at all and plus Leita needs to know what she wants. Oh well. 

One more thing, I think I know why I just wanted to spend time alone on Christmas. I was actually hoping that Leita would actually come over to the house and see me there. You know, maybe surprise me or something. It would be a good thing, I wouldn't argue with it but it's just wishful thinking and stuff. I know she won't do it because one she doesn't like the house because it's my parents house, secondly, I'm sure she has plans with her family and lastly we're not together. I hate this alot. Can't even spend time with the one you love the most. Oh well. well that's four years in a row. I'm batting a thousand I tell you.

At least some good news, I've gotten some invites to dinners for Christmas by some of my friends, so maybe I'll be going to that to get out of the house. YOu know, enjoy company and what not. It beats staying at home building models(which of course I enjoy but it beats being alone if I go).

Oh well, happy holidays to all."

"event","Well, the past few days have been interesting. Interesting enough in fact that I'm wanting to share it. Let's see, well I have been working my ass off for quite some timeat Walmart and well I'm just plain tired. Not dead tired or beat tired. Just plain tired. I can't wait for the holidays be over with soon. I can't take it any more. 

Well basically I have been looking into a vehicle for myself and pretty much things are looking abit up.  I just hope that I'm able to do this within a month or two. It's either going to be a vehicle from chevy or saturn. both have proven to be great vehicles that will last. I selected one vehicle so far and I went through Geico to see what would the insurance on it would be. It's actually a very manageable price for the the vehicle. sorry I didn't mention it earlier but the vehicle I chose was the 1999 Saturn SL1 4D sedan. It's very nice and has about 53 thousand miles on it. Not too bad. 
Another step towards something alot better. 

Another thing, just in case no one knows about this, my roommate is a big fat liar. I thought other people were bad but he takes the cake. He claims to have a job but yet I go to his workplace and every associate tells me that he does not work there at all. Oh god this has mad me extremely mad because one: he doesn't trust me to tell me he has no job, and two: he isn't paying anything it seems. I don't know what to do except tell him he needs to head on out if he's not planning on getting a job. I don't know. but here's the kicker, he's moving out on Wednesday, so, he 'll go somewhere else and be a leech there. I'm not doing so well with roommates. I'm 0 and 2. Not a good record. Oh well. 

God, I love sliders. If anyone remembers, there was a show called ,""Sliders"" and it was pretty good and corny. It was a show that started off on Fox and left that channel to go on the SciFi channel. I was disappointed that the producers of the show didn't really have any more good material for the show. But any way the point I was trying to make was that it's actually funning in some parts of the show. There is one world that they 'slide' to, they see a billboard that says, ""BC cola: the birth control you can drink"" lol. That is so funny. I have been watching my sliders box set from back in September that I haven't had the chance to watch until now. I really like this show. I just wish that a show that had a man ,who was paralyzed, fighting crime through a super powered suit and called himself Mantis would come out on DVD. I just wished I remembered the name of that show.

Well that's all for now. Show's over, nothing to see here, move along."

"event","Hello, all. Sorry I haven't written lately but I have been actually been busy for quite some time. First, I was finishing off some work for school while I was also trying to survive Walmart as much as possible. I can't wait for the Christmas holiday to be over with. Let's see, it sort of snowed here in the city and country and it left my water pumped frozen. It took about a day in a half for the pump to finally defrost. I have running water again. 
Well, let's get into the main subject of this post, shall we? ::pulls up a chair and takes a sip of tropical punch juice:: Well, I finally finished my letter to my mother and delivered it to her. Of course there was alot of yelling and screaming on her part and I just let her get it all out. She was so pissed that she left four messages on my cell phone and IMed me about 30 times and still was counting by the time I woke up to these lovely messages. Basically, all of the messages were about Leita and how she was the cause of all of this. Yes, I did lie to my mother again about ""breaking up"" with Leita and I do regret doing so because I was trying so hard to not lie about anything anymore. Maybe in part of the reason why I decided to come clean about it was because of what Leita's mom had told me a few months ago. She asked me how can I be with Leita if I'm living in a lie by lying to my own mother about my relationship to Leita. It's like saying that I'm embarassed of being with Leita if I won't acknowledge our relationship to my own mother. It makes Leita feel like she is the other woman. I'm done with making that compromise involving Leita. If I'm with Leita, then I will acknowledge my relationship to my mother, no matter what the consequences may be. Sorry, I got off alittle off subject, so allow me to return. After alot of screaming and yelling later, my mother finally calm down so that I can actually talk to her. After the conversation, I went away with a few things from it. Or actually one or two things.I got away with it that she did not really ""read"" what i wrote in the letter but actually read what she wanted out of it. Of course this is natural for most people to just read what they want to read but it hurts when that's all that is read. She mainly concentrated on how this was just a clever ploy by Leita and a plan for me to drop out of school. Then in this clever ploy that my mother thought up, then I would work for the rest of my life, waiting hand and foot on Leita while Leita just eats bon bons at home. I'm not quite sure how this works out that way but some how she comes up with this. She wants to say that Leita not going to work but yet I don't feel this way. Another thing I don't get is how she continues on about the incident between Leita, my mom and Leita's friend where basically she was told off. I still think that the whole incident was a double edged sword. I hope I'm using this saying right. First edge, yes it was not right of Leita's friend to tell my mom off the way she did, especially when she doesn't even know who my mother is. Yes, there are things that a boyfriend and girlfriend say to each other especially persoanl things that should be kept to each other. I understand these things.  But then here's the other edge of this sword. Leita's friend telling off my mother has actually opened my eyes to what was happening to me and my life and even in my relationship with Leita. I still thank her, for this to happen to me. Who knows? But still I'm confused if I even gained any thing except defend both Leita and her family. There are a few other things I would like to discuss on this conversation and letter I had with my mother but I feel like I will mess it up as I write it. So I will stop discussing it. 
So with this break up with Leita, and a few other things, I have begun my journey in making myself better and hopefully I will be able to gain Leita's favor once again. If not, then I will have to live with it and try to carry on with life without Leita, no matter how painful it may be. Oh well. So swell, go jump in a well. ;-)"

"event","Hello, well today was very interesting and long. I worked  till eleven at night again, actually correction, till 12:30. I'm just glad that I'm going to get alot of pay on the next paycheck I get. Yes! First problem I had for the night was the lady who wanted to get  a tv. It was a tv that Target had for sale for about $88......last week. Normally, we say no to such a thing because the sale was for last week, not this week. Normally, yes, we do comp ad the price but not for a price about a week old. And here's the kicker, she had a raincheck for the tv.....AT TARGET!!! Why the hell would a person get a raincheck for Target at Walmart. This boggles my mind to the most extreme measures. And yes normally Walmart would not redeem such a raincheck because their policy does not include rainchecks, but guess what? Our management said to go ahead and honor the raincheck and the lady got a tv for $88 to be happy with. Thank you Target and thank you Walmart management. My faith in my management continues to dwindle into nothingness. Oh well. Nothing new.
onward with my day at work. Work was hectic because today was the last day to pick up your christmas layaway. So naturally, there were tons of people in a line so long that it pasted by three departments and ended in a fourth. Well of course they were all there about 11:30 at night so alot of people were irritated about waiting so long for their layaway. I have one question though, if you're going to be irritated about that, why did you not try to get the layaway out about a week before the due date instead of the very last day to get it out. It makes no sense. I know people get paid at different times but it's just ridiculous about how people get irritated about waiting when they could of tried to avoid it. 
Ok, the last thing in my work odyssey. I had to go swimming in a bin full of DVDs. The story with that is that a customer lost his gold chain in the $5.50 dump bin full of DVDs. Me and a fellow associate were asked to try to retreive the precious item. First we started pulling all of the DVDs out of the bin but when it got so low that we couldn't reach it, we thought of a new plan. This plan involved dumping me into the bin and continue fishing out DVDs of the bin. So basically I was trapped in this bin with DVDs towering over me , threatening to fall and smother me into oblivion. Not a very nice death if you ask me. It took an additional ten minutes to fully finish looking for the chain. Unfortunately, we did not find the chain. We had to call off our search and called it a night. Then I finally rose from the bin and out came a man! just kidding. 
:-) More like I just jumped out of the bin with the assitance of my fellow associate. 
Oh well. another adventure under my belt. 
Other than that, I was fine for the day but I swear I though about Leita alot today and not because I saw her but because I kept on seeing her car. Normally when I see her car, it's one that is different as in a differen color, or a sunroof, or a spoiler in the rear. But it was her car but not really because someone else was driving it. God, I probably saw her car about four times today and I was getting alittle freaked out. For awhile I thought that I was accidently following Leita or I thought she was following me or something. Finally I calmed myself down and said that all of these supposed Leita sightings are just a coincedence and also all of the sightings were not her. Talk about Leita on the brain. Oye. If it happens again, I might freak out. Oh well.
Hopefully, I'll go watch Blade: Trinity tomorrow night. ::crosses fingers:: please please"

"event","Well, today was both interesting and not as long as I thought it would be. I went to Pembroke today so that I can work on the yearbook. I was there from about 1 in the afternoon till about 9 or so. I just worked on my section, which I didn't think needed alot of work until I saw how much was not done. Oh boy, I'm going back in tomorrow. That's all I got to say about that. 
Well after Pembroke, I went over to Jason and April's house to bug them for awhile. Me and Jason played Star Wars: Jedi Academy for awhile and I actually beat him quite a few times that made me smile. hehehe. But I do have one thing to say, if any one who has 200 dollars wants to give me a christmas present, please buy me a xbox and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2: sith lords. Please, please! I know I shouldn't just buy a game just because of a few games but I really want to play that game to death. It just looks so addicting! ::drooling::
Overall , in life I'm doing fine. I'm tired but I'm fine. I'm almost done with the infamous letter that I'm writing to my mother. Hopefully, I will gather all the courage I need to send it to her and receive the very severe response that I'm expecting. Oh well. I'm sure that when I ready, I'll be ready. 
Let's see here, here's a Erica update. No, we're not together but we're just talking for right now, and she's making sure that I don't say ""I love you"" by shocking me through my computer chair at home everytime I say it. At least we're talking instead of not talking. I should be happy about it, and believe me I am, I'm just alittle sadden by us not being togehter. Well that's why we're talking instead of not. I'm just told by some people that I need to just lay off for right now and see how things come out. I just hope for the best. that's all.
And one final thing, at the request of Darth Cyrilus, I will try to refrain from warping minds by some of the things that I have said in an earlier post. Basically it refers to the questions that I posted for myself to answer. Well, Darth's mind is now warped and well he's no longer functioning correctly. He'll never be the same again. Well, I better go. Talk later and maybe I'll go watch Shaun of the Dead or Blade Trinity on Thursday since I have the day off. Anyone wants to go? The offer is out there."

"event","Well, here I am again. Let's see what crazy or insane things I'm going to say today. And also it doesn't help that I'm really tired and ready to go to bed here but I just want to make sure I say a few things and let it be.
First of all, I would like to say, ""Good god I'm tired."" Work tonight was very busy ant hectic. We had a guy call out on us because he had to go do reserve duty. So it let only me and the new girl at work to try to close. Main question for the night was, ""Do you have any PS2s?"" Good god, no we do not have any in at this moment. Sony fucked up with their manufacturing and now there seems to be a shortage of game systems.I've basically stayed there until 1:30 in the morning. Now, my back is very sore and I feel so tense along with being stressed out. Oye. I really need to relax one day and not worry about anything. That'll happen around when I retire I believe ;-)
Well let's see here. what else, what else? Friday was my last day for the semester at Pembroke and I'm just glad that it is over for now. Maybe I can really rest and and work on the things I want to. yeah maybe. I do have to be back on Monday because I have some additional work to be done for the yearbook. So hopefully, I'll be able to just spend that one day doing that and don't have to worry about it for awhile. I have been trying to decide on something for school though. I'm tryint to decide if I want to either take a break from school or just take one class for the spring semester so that i can somehow still be in the system at Pembroke. Decisions, decisions. I'm trying to decide on this mainly because I truly feel burned out by school and what not. So I've decided to make this decision so that I can figure things out and what not. We'll see what happens.
Now I'm talking with Leita again but I'm backing off telling her constantly, ""I love you, I miss you , I need you, and I'm a mess without you"" She's probably tired of me telling her that, so I've decided not to do anything that would provoke her for the time being. I just hope that she'll come to and would want to be together once more. She and I proposed a sort of get together but I shall be privy to say anything because I'm not sure she wants me to broadcast this all over the internet. It's a abit diffcult to discuss to someone I guess because of what it is. I don't know. I just miss her and well it eats at me in the inside. Maybe she'll come back or maybe she won't. I do not not. I'm just hoping for the best in this situation. And if things do get better, then I know what I must do. The right thing to do. It's something inside of me that needs to come on. It's sort of whole thing with 'you have to let your feelings out instead of bottling them all up"". oh well. I'm not going to be so inaffective like I was while me and Leita were together. :-)
Okay enough about Leita, let's get onto a different matter. My roommate. Basically things are okay but there have been a few snags. First he had lied to me about his age and I mistakely bought alcohol for him. ::slaps self in the hand:: then he has lied to several females about his age to sleep with them. then finally he and his friend had drugs in the house. Well, basically when I found that out,I was furious about it. First I went to my roommates friend and told him that if he doesn't get his drugs off the table and out of my house, I will use a vaccuum cleaner and suck all of the crap up with it. I don't care how much he spent on it but I will do it. If he loves it so much, then he is more than welcomed to my vaccuum cleaner bag after I'm done. I've had this talk with my roommate and told him the same thing. He told me that he quit two weeks ago because he has to be ready for his ""supposed"" role on the Wake forest basketball team. But I thought the team already started last month on Nov. 2. huh? that just confuses the heck out of me. Maybe he's lying. hmmmm. But last night when I got into the house, my roommate was on the couch playing video games, as usual, and he smelled like marijuana. I didn't ask him about it because for all I could know is that a friend could of brought him back from another house where he was smoking it. Well that time I'm letting it slide but the next time it happens, I'm nipping it in the butt. I will not allow illegal drug use or possession at my own home. I'm not going down for anybody that doesn't respect my own wishes and lies to me like that. Oh well. I've ranted long enough now. I shall go and probably get ready for work. Oh glorious work. I rather be off today and do something else, like Leita. Oh well. ""I owe, I owe, so off to work I go!"""

"event","Well, hello everybody. It's about to be day two of not talking to Erica and I'm still going abit strong. Who would of known I could of done it without breaking down and calling or IMing her. Every part of me wants to but I'm resisting as much as I can. :: borg in background chanting,"" Resistance is futile!"":: I miss her. Well I just got off from work and boy, am I tired. I was supposed to be off today BUT they called me in and well I answered their call. It seems like the general public has grown to be more stupid and stupid as Christmas nears to us. Oh well. 
I've got some work to take care of tomorrow but I'll go see April & Jason tomorrow afterwards so that we can play some Knights of the old republic 2. Yes! At least it will keep my mind off of things for most of the day and help me with not talking or IMing Erica. It's funny how it's always hard to something like this and try to find things to keep yourself busy in order to not do it. And no, I'm not using April & Jason as a way of keeping my mind off of things. I haven't seen them for awhile and I kinda abit ignored them unintentionally the past few months. Sorry. 
Someone told me that I apologize too much, so I'm trying to cut down on that. But damn, it's kinda hard to kick an old habit. 
I'm starting to actually write a letter that will go to my mom. I know this is the point where most people will just get up and leave their computer but I promise you it might be abit interesting. For in this letter, contains many things that she doesn't know about me. Mainly alot of them are my feelings. ""Oh no! Feelings! I'm melting, melting!"" Basically, what I'm trying to do is convey how I feel on alot of things that she has done and everything. About how I feel about her almost controlling my dating life, how I feel about always having to appease her with my dating choices, how I feel about her doing some of things that she has done in her ""love"". I need to do this for several reasons. For one, it will help me achieve a higher level of confidence by actually telling her these things about how I feel and how I feel about some of the things that she has done to me. Secondly, I would like to do this mainly because if I don't tell her these things, then no one in my family will do it. It will remain to be an endless cycle of this emotional turmoil.  Plus it might actually feel VERY good to tell her off in this way. But here is a big kicker though. In this letter, I will actually tell her about that I never did break up with Leita and well I'll live with the consequences of that action. If I get kicked out of the house, then I get kicked out. I will not be influenced anymore by her to the point that I'm some drone. No one has the right to do that to any person and treat them so.  You can probably view this as my grand stand against her and see what happens when she is opposed by her own son. Maybe it will be good but then It might not be. I don't know. All I can do is encourage myself and stand tall on my own. Maybe this is the test of fire that I must go through. I don't know. 
This section would of probably been devoted to Leita but I'm sure you're tired of me saying, ""I miss her, I love her, or I can stand to be without her or I'll die for her right. "" But I'm going to give it a rest for tonight because none of that will suddenly bring her back. It will take time. Nothing more, nothing less. I must stand strong and tall and hope for the best. Well I better go now.
My offer still stands. Anyone can ask me five questions that I will answer to the best of my knowledge. Come on. I dare you! Neeh!"

For said individual, in order to achieve a successful, healthy dating relationship and a way of individualism and self confidence, he must avoid getting tickets by not running stop signs. 

END OF AMENDMENT.

With that said, let me elaborate. Well I was driving around Pembroke when unexpectingly I ran a stop sign. I didn't know that I did when I saw blue lights. I pulled over and the officer told me that I ran a stop sign. I honestly didn't see the sign at all. He actually asked me if I was drunk and I told him that at 4 in the afternoon is abit early for drinking. He laughed at that and gave me a warning ticket. Believe me, I'll be very careful around intersections from now on. 

Well my day was fine and I 've kept myself busy for the most part. I went to school to do some stuff and then I actually fell asleep at the school in the parking lot. I woke up at around 7 in the evening. Dear god. Then I went to Angelcakes141 house and hung out there to kept myself busy once more. I picked up my friend at work and dropped him off at work. Well I'm keeping myself busy because I do not want to bug or annoy or bother Leita right now. She needs her space and I finally realized that. It hurts me to do so but I must do it for her and for our relationship, if we are to salvage it into something very wonderous. I just hope for the best. I would like to thank Jason and AngelCakes for their advice for me. I really appreicate the support and help. Maybe we can make it afterall. :-) 

I've been fighting with a very hard decision though. I think I'm going to tell my mother that I was still dating Leita all of this time. I want to see what is her reaction and would like to see what would happen if I did say that. I'm ready for the consequences of the decision I'm about to make. It will test myself and see how far I have come in trying to build myself more confidence. I hope for the best but I do expect the possibility of the worst. Oh well. Well I have the entire next two days off from work and school until Friday. Well, I hope I'll find something to do in the two days. Otherwise, I'll be very bored. Maybe I can go over to Jason's house ;-)

But one thing though, Leita I love you very much, if you're reading this. Let's see if I can make it through an entire day of not talking to Leita and go for two days. I'm really trying to give you space with every fiber of my being.

"event","MISSION STATEMENT:
        To achieve a level of confidence that would, for said individual, allow a way of independence and a way of achieving a successful, healthy dating relationship with one certain person or any other future person. 
        A way of independence is defined as being able to make a decision that cannot be influenced by material things, essentially threatening statments and straight coercion. 
        The achievement of a successful, healthy dating relationship will be defined as one that will be free of influence by material things, essentially threatening statements, and straight coercion by any third parties around the relationship. If such violations occur, it will be handled in a manner that displays the qualities of an individual who have mastered the ideals of self-confidence, appreciation for others, and overall courage. The secondary objective of the successful healthy dating relationship for said individual is to show appreication for the other person in the relationship. The individual must also show that he cares for the other in every way humanly possible.

END OF STATMENT.

That is my mission statment for myself in this stage in life. It says alot within these three paragraphs even though it doesn't show it. This took me awhile to write. So Leita if you're reading this, then this is my plan of action of what I want to do. I just hope that one day you would be at the end result of my plan of action. I really hope for the best. 

It was my sort of last day with the counselor and I'm actually filled with more confidence thn I've had for awhile. She basically told me that I should try to make myself better and try to concentrate on me. If my ex girlfriend wants to be with me, then she will. And if she doesn't, then it was better to love and lost than to never have loved at all. I'm going to make this confidence last awhile. I'm ready to start rebuilding myself to make my situation better for myself. I'm not letting anything get me down. I'm going to do my best. 

Leita, I hope that I will be with you again one day as a better person that I am now. I want to show that I do appreciate every aspect of everything you have to offer. I want to show that to you. I've grieved on for a week and now I must not try to be sad any more. I have to concentrate at the plan at hand.

There was a funny thing that was brought up at the session today. My mother awhile back ago said that I was with Leita due to lust. Partially, she's right but then she is wrong. Me and Leita loved each other in different ways. We loved each other on the emotional, physical and almost spiritual level. If you want to call being in love in the physical sense, then you can call it lust but it was a good kind of lust because we loved each other in other ways than that. I just hope to be back with her one day. And if that day doesn't come then, I've lost something dear to me and I must face the facts. That's all.

Leita, I love you and I hope to talk to you in the matters of love once again."

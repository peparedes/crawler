"event","AJ (my cat) has lost 2 pounds over the past week and we've been going through vet visits, force feeding, antibiotics, hundreds of dollars - all the fun stuff.  

He's feeling better.  The little fella got feisty and bit me the other day while the vet was here.  I washed my hands as I usually do after handling the cat, but the vet immediately got some other anti-bact. stuff and insisted I call my doctor right then and there.  She said ""cat scratch fever"" is a real thing!   Yeah...I know the song.

So my doctor calls back immediately (wow..) and gets me antibiotics.   Within the hour both hands swelled up, ached and I was feeling pretty nautious.  I suppose part of that reaction was due to the fact that I am, in spite of owning one, allergic to cats.    

I feel better this morning.  I would have never believed how critical it is to treat a cat bite so fast.  The way the vet positioned it, sounded like it was as bad as a snake bite!

The little fur ball (who I love) still needs his meds given to him every day....so I guess the war is on!  

Lesson learned for me - wear armor."

They say the only way to truley know someone is through time.  Time flys.  

What I know is:  

This man talks to me about anything.  

This man wants to hear what I have to say.  

This man touches me with tenderness.  I can feel the sincerity.  It feels nice.

This man has been through trenches of his own and still wants to gives love another chance.  

This man moves forward with the knowledge of pain and the courage to trust again.

"event","Tuned back into this journal after quite an emotional hiatus. Reading all these entries reminds me how real the world is.  So cool.  

Thanksgiving is upon us here in the US.  It's pretty easy to gorge yourself with food and football (etc) on the day off.  But whether spoken or thought I wonder  if everyone looks around themselves at some point on Thursday and ""gives thanks"" in their own way.  

Somewhere along the way my road turned from the traditional.  At 42 I have no kids, no husband.  And I wonder.  I start and end all these holidays by myself. 
But I have a dump load of friends, a dog, a cat, a grand piano, gear, life in my heart.  I have a house that probably isn't necessary in the eyes of simplicity.  

So yeah, my thankful is full.  Hope yours is too!"

"event","Green-Eyed-Lady, I'm okay.  And thank you for checking and asking.

Family life takes a crazy turn sometimes.  My sister has become estranged over some bout of selfishness (and who knows what else), retired parents are tangled up in financial messes, my brother & I landed in the midst of the crap-pile.   

Two squirls built a condo in my chimney, the contractor who repointed & stucco'd this past summer forgot to put the screen back on there.   No, no chinmey fire, but the house sucked up a lot of smoke.  The clean up is just getting finished now.  What a mess.  

Flip side - the music is going great.  I'm about 80% complete with my first solo disc. I don't think it's the greatest stuff, mostly because I've written so many other songs and have also recorded quite a lot with other artists.  The other cool thing is that there are a few people interested in the tunes, so who knows.  Art, I feel, is something each of us does from ourselves for ourselves.  It's a real kick when someone else digs it.  It's the ultimate compliment.  Really.

On the adoption front, no progress.  But I have faith.  What is meant to be will be.  My producer says to me - ""Why adopt a KID?  You've got the world by the balls.  Why would you ever want to change it?""  He asks if it's just company that I want.  That I should perhaps just give a man a chance.  

I don't know.  Just something inside of me.  

No, I'm not man-hunting either because that's just so much work.  I'm tired of these 6 month affairs. It's such a predictable cycle.  Men get bored and then that's that.  Better to have loved and lost?   That's bullshit anymore.  

But it raises interesting thoughts.  This adoption, is it just company for me?  Honestly, yes and no.  Yes because I've got this big house with just me and the dog, cat & bird.  I want to give this to someone.  Kids are great.  They are life.  They are tomorrow.  They are work.  They are a new priority. And with all the volunteer work I've done with teens, I know the heartache and challenges.  I've seen them successful, seen them addicted and recover, I've seen them die.  Sometimes I think I must be crazy.  However I have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to give of myself to a kid who won't have a chance at it.  A permanent thing, not just a small snapshot in their life.  So, ""no"" it's not just company I'm longing.

I know I wouldn't be good with an infant, but a kid who is older ...  just a feeling I have. 

And you wouldn't believe the ""caution"" everyone throws at me.  They tell me the music is going to end.  The rehearsals, the shows, the recording, the rock.  To that I ask why?  Why does it have to change?   Rearrange maybe, slow down maybe, but not change.  

Rambling here....   

So folks, I'm not gone.  Just took a break.  By the way - Happy New Year. 

(Now I'm going to check into fortysomething and see what you all have been up to!)"

"event","It's been 90-degrees and the the air is about as thick as a slice of cheese cake.  Welcome to a typical Pennsylvania summer.  However this weather is extreme.  Flash floods have demolished houses and cars, caused rivers to overflow and washed out the earth creating sink holes in excess of 15 feet deep and at least as long.   

Couple the weather with an excessive work load and I'm not worth a dime at the end of the day.  In spite of all the exhaustion I still can't sleep.  My arms tingle with anxiety and my heart races as if it were in love (but that's another dream, another day).  

I don't know what to think about myself.  It's times like these when my doctor tells me to take the sleeping pill to get shut eye, and the mild sedative to calm the nerves.  I hate this and yet my body is addicted.  Without the sleeping pill, I don't have a chance of sleep.  

Ironically I practice yoga every day, holding the pose and pushing the limit.  To no avail.

Bottom line to me is that the work load is excessive.  I've been working on a large research project and expected to float all the other accounts at the same time.  Perhaps I was overzealous in thinking I could handle all of that.  Knee deep, you can't bow out now.  So I persevere and know this time will pass and all will level out again.  Difficult to extract the emotion when you're tired and full of anxiety...."

I find the human race quite interesting.  Stress points.  Joy.  Sorrow.  The way that people hide from things is amazing.  The way I hide from things!  

It's taken years to figure myself out and yet, thankfully I suppose, I still come across paths I've never taken before.  

Love.  Marriage is confusing.  Is a human being the sort of creature that mates forever?  How so?  Aren't our minds way too advanced to stay committed to any thing but ourselves?  

The cycle is such that we fall in love and the fireworks of passion take over.  The chemical changes within are elation, high if you will.  Every time you see that person your knees go weak!  And where does this all go?  Why do we stop feeling the elation?  Why does a cold last 10 days?   Is love an emotional virus?"

Life has been pretty neutral.  I'm concentrating on the new promotion and bringing this position to some kind of fruition.  I feel pretty challenged by the fact that I have been given the opportunity to pave my own path.  Go figure!  A little scary, but who has time to be scared when there's your ethics and ideals to communicate!   All your life you dream of being someone who others listen to.  Someone who changes things.  Here it is.  

I come home and get lost in the serenity.  I wallow in the silence and it brings me to a point where I can't move.  I'm on fire at work and totally burned out when I get home.  No balance.   What's missing?

"event","<p>The day started out with such promise. I was able to divert to Dunkin Donuts and get real coffee..AHHHH that was nice. No one bawked that I got into work fifteen minutes late which is unusual....The bawking not me being late! Well then the wheels go off. I get called to the rug gallery to flip rugs for an interior design client. I may be Jafar in Aladdin but i sure has hell cant fly these babies so it is an ardous task.....I flip for 2 hours and forty minutes these retarded rugs and the client cant find one. I have 4 235 rugs ranging in all sizes and colors he cant find ONE! I expel it like a bad breath....OHH SA OH SA I rub my ears like Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys 2....IT doesnt help! Its here I notice a Tiger skin rug... seems we have a vendor who will make&nbsp; a rug in the shape of a tiger skin rug....I proceed to wrap the tiger skin on my shoulders and sing some dididdies from the Lion King including that African Gibberish....All this whilst riding down the escalator! It was my moment of zen. It was also the last moment of piece I would have. Did I mention it was a ten thousand dollar rug! IT amused me......The rest of&nbsp; teh day was usual, too much to do no time...Then a Sewar Pipe backflowed and then the <a href=""mailto:Sh@t"">Sh@t</a> really flowed....Hence my thirteen hour day which I ended up by spending time with a fellow ex bar tender who useed to work at tupelos with me. Now she works at Whooville and we caught up on all the gossip from the old days....She pointedly asked me why i was single..cause I am an asshole replies me....Ohh thats right I forgot says her....GOD LIFE IS GOOD!</p>"

"event","<p>And that is how my day started.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I knew that The retail life involved so many muckety mucks coming and going. We have had nothing but VIP visit after VIP visit.Its a freaking dog and pony show. I had to prep my store for two vistis last week and theen today fro one that is actually pertinent to me. It is called called a Service and shortage visit and is geared towards operations. So I start to focus on that and low and behold I have absolutely no crew today....<br /><br />So im am clearing out old furniture and tables etc., when i get a phone call that there are soem teenagers who wont get out of our mattress department.. Guess since I am all in black I am Security to....ANYWHOS I go to the department and tell the teens to leave. One of the douchebags decides to be confrontational. Well I am beyond caring and TOTALY CRANKY....some in the old circles might be referring to me as Asshole Tom now....so I come at the little prick pretty hard...Tell him to get the fuck out of my store.....This little Toad shit decides to stand his ground... I smile a Wolfish grin...and thank him for being Stupid..... First he says he was looking at Beds, told him to go to&nbsp;Dail a Mattress and dont forget to drop the last S &nbsp;cause he couldnt afford ours....He begins to protest I just say get the fuck out... At this point one of the salesguys comes over. We have had many a beer together and often quote many a movie, he decides to play LETS FUCK WITH THE TWERP GAME...he begins to quote TANGO and CASH...HE says to me Your Not Gonna put a chair on hsis throat? And I reply Well Icant find a Piano...... THe Kid is now looking from one to the other and says to me whats your name...it just so hapens I am wearing my name badge so Ia ask him if he can read...He says yes but wants to write my name down....It was then he asked me for a pen!&nbsp; I absolutely busted out laughing.....I said let me get this staright you want to write my name down and you want me to give you the pen.....I asked him how proud his parents were that the afterbirth survived......Even my coworker was stunned by this comment.... The kid was completely off and just started to leave and he said I want to rememeber your name....I walked him to the front reciting my name. the whole time..........</p>"

"event","&nbsp;So I got Dispatched to Paul Loduca,s house to change a lightbulb. Yep thats right a lightbulb........ He purchased around 100K in furniture for his new condo and one of the Cabinets had a bad bulb. So they sent me.... Now mind you I normally dont mind, NORMALLY but Im not loving that place right now. I work for a company that thinks it part MIB and part PATTERNS OF FORCE from the original Star Trek Series....Basically a world that Models itself after Hitlers Gernmany becuase they Society was so orderly??????&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GM of the Gallery should be hoping around looking for HER PRECIOUS. If I had a volacano handy Id throw her in by her bulbous nose. She has apparently decided that i threaten her world and has been trying not so covertly lately to get me....

So I drive to Loduca's condo in a community that is for over 55 year olds.....Ahh the plot thickens! His Girlfriend is a lanky greek that wears high heels while unpacking her stuff. &nbsp;Gum Cracking and some kind of animal print pants. I was almost expecting to see Michelle Pfeffier from MARRIED TO THE MOB. I kinda of just rolled my eyes and introduced myself. She kept calling me Tim, I would have offered to write some advice for repacking the merchandise becuase I doubt that Paulie will be here next season....."

Yes I am a bigot and a white supremacist and a..GULP REPUBLICAN....But Jesus H CHrist on a popsicle stick someone needs to send these beaners back down....They come to my country, dont bother learning my language, BUT I should respect them right.....HELL NO...... If I had my way Id pull down the statute of Liberty, smelt it down.......Its freaking French anyway and her torch would now be a Stop Sign. It Would read "" Yo Guiero TACO BELL YO Guiero Hell"" Do we not have enough Landscapers in this world anyway......<br /><br />But I digress, let me tell you a story. On May 18th I was driving my car, and waiting to turn into my neighborhood. When I look in my rear view miroor and see this old beater of a car barreling down, he looks like he is about to change lanes so i look down and then next thing I know my glasses are flying into the windshield and all my stuff from my glove box is flying into my backseat.. Always wanted to be a crash test dummy.... So I get out of my car and this little frodo looking Mexican stars yelling at me "" look what I did aye&nbsp; aye aye"" I took a step towards him and stopped, said to myself just a car, and thats what insurance is for....Right..... I look down at waht was left of My honda accords ass and go yeah thats definately waht insurance is for....<br /><br />Well the cops come and all of a sudden Crash Banticoot The Wetback stops speaking English, I point out to the Officer his expired plates from Rhode Island and the police officer the decides to call his Ins company..Thats all He has. The funny thing is I used work for them in another life so I figure OK&nbsp;I can work the system.<br /><br />Well now they tell me they need to speak to their insurede, ofcourse i say, but remind them that with the police report, my notification, and the fact I was hit from behind the clock was ticking.....<br /><br />Long Story short, I end up eating the first $500 dollars of rental, becase they wouldnt agree yet, find out my car which I almost was done paying for was going to be totaled and a new used car would cost me around $450 a month. So I then come across a nice truck at my favorite Bar&nbsp; The Main Event....Its one of the owners so I make an offer, and he says he just needs to check with someone else........Turns out one of the Guys in the kitchen was intersested......<br /><br />I miss teh days when the Mexicans wer the Mexicants!<br /></p>"

I must be a magnet to the incredible stupid! Wasnt there a patron saint for these lunkheads. ST DUFUS OF THE CLUELESS. It seem s since we eliminated our customer service people, I get all the gems! First off how an upscale store that prides itself on Customer Satisfaction, eliminates the one group that is actually trained to do said satisfcation!&nbsp;&nbsp; RUTROO RASTRO!&nbsp; So now they come to me!&nbsp;

WHOS OUR FIRST CALLER?&nbsp;
WELL DR CRANK ITS SIMON.......
GO AHEAD SIMON IM SORT OF LISTENING, BUT NOT REALLY&nbsp;......you see Simon, OOHH my dear sweet simple Simon I read your file......A Polish Immigrant who decided to buy a couch, chair ottoman and love seat&nbsp; and have it delivered to your home in forest Hills, then ship it to your summer home in Fleischmanns, I HAVENT A CLUE WHER THE HELL THAT IS, but its close enough to call Bob and Doug Mackenzie neighbors, eh! So Simple Simon packs up his pies and decides that he realizes teh couch is a differnt color then everything else! I dont know maybe its wearing its winter coat now, or perhaps he should have inspected the pieces closer before he sent them up with BALTO!&nbsp; Simple simon now DEMANDS I remove the furniture, I tell him absolutely not a problem....ONCE they are back in Forest Hills. We do not deliver that far hence why he had to transport it himself! I remind him of this! He gets agitated, I explain we are not responsible for this, as he was past his&nbsp; 3 day return window by 9 months! Ohh hes undaunted, demanding i make ""situation correct"". Told him it would be my pleasure, as soon as the merchandise came back to wher we delivered it. We keep this lively banter on for quite a bit, back and forth.... Hes getting agitated and agitated....I quickly refer to my Customer service manual...How To deal with a Crazy Polish Immigrant who actually makes the jokes true....Ay yes Chapter five...Tell an analagy.....Simon, if you walk into a chinese food restaurant with a live chicken, and you put said chicken down in the kitchen, and then you order chowmein., you cant get made at the chef if he uses fresh chicken!....Oh boy did &nbsp;he start going off. He used the word Doopah, It means ass i believe. A few hours later I get a call that he had complained about me, called me a Bad Person, who wouldnt help him out. I was not being sympathetic to him, since he MOVED UPSTATE A MONTH AGO.... Ahh Says I, so I asked the GM what number should I call and apologize at. She gives me his home number its a 718 area code....... I stare at her balnky for a minute then laugh.....Had almost as much fun as the Chinese family that I had to deal with On Sunday after Saint Patricks day!"

"event","<p>And of course sometimes its just me but hey got to have some fun.....<br /><br />Life has been interesting at Bloomingdales these days..... Got back yet another tree that was sold! I feel bad for the driver, he has to deliver these stupid genuine looking Jurassic park prop pieces. I&nbsp;let him put it in the compactor and press the CRUSH Button. Consider it Salvaging with exterme prejudice. The Driver was very amused, His son who is not only taking a full curriculum but helps his dad Deliver my stuff on mondays was just shaking his head. After we&nbsp;were done crushing the 9 ft palm tree to smitherens, the son told me that the person was giving his dad a hard time and kept complaining about the fact that the leaves were scratching her ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently she was berating Luis pretty bad so I decided to call her up. She began demanding damages for her ceiling. I then told her that My leaves were damaged by paint from her ceiling and that I would have to sell the tree at a lose, if I could even sell it all! I told i would forget about it and simply pay the driver a delivery fee and a pick up fee....She balked at that and said that her 8 and 1/2 foot ceiling had Gouges from ....THE 9 foot tree I interrupted. She claimed that she didnt know that, I asked her to read some of the information off her Sales receipt so I could confirm the credit.&nbsp; Sure enough she reads 9 Feet Tall Bannana Palm tree. She asks what Im going to do, about what I ask? About her ceiling....She is persistent....Well now Im pretty much done with The Tree Killer so I say I wont look up if I go to her house. Its at this point she begins to stammer....She demands my name, I spell it real slowly.&nbsp; I ask her why she would purchase The set piece from Gilligans Island when it wouldn't have fit? Apparently she admitted she measured after the fact...dumb ass.....<br /></p>"

Mind you It is&nbsp;normally over 9 feet tall and weighs over 100&nbsp;pounds. The driver pull out his notes from NOV 16 when he delivered thsi tree and notates that the customer had asked him to cut it down so it would fit in his Hovel! Well Thank you MATLOCk, case closed NO MONEY BACK.....so i go upstairs a tune on my lips and a skip to my step and tell the Store Manager to deny the&nbsp;credit....

So we have been trying to get a handle on it.&nbsp; Compared to my day I will take the stink.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was working in the gallery when I get a phone call from the Gallery Mananger &nbsp;that the&nbsp; GM of Both stores needs a favor.

He was told I was coming and apparently HE was told something different then I WAS! &nbsp;Apparently they needed an executive in the department, so lets send The furniture Guy! Awesome......IT got to teh point wher i was getting shoes for xcutomers, and actually selling a few pairs, which I then handed off to two of the girls who were actually helping me. One of the older shoe hags decided to confront me on that. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE...she says to me? Im the manager they sent over here today, but you didnt seem to really care when it was explained to you, was my reply. The look was priceless. I then see her trying to gleam my name off my nametag, I write it down for her and go Here this is easier for you! At this point the two girls i was working with were trying hard to stifle laughs...... As I was ending my time in Shoetopia, I was trying to get some shoes for a woman, looked for three pairs, we didnt have them in her size so she leaves.<br /><br />She left and went to Furniture Gallery where I ran into her again. I helped her pick out a Mattress and told her we didnt have it in a size seven either!&nbsp; </p>"

"event","So heres how my day ended up at work. With Inventory and Muckity mucks visiting I have been putting in some Long days. The icing on the cake was when one of the Sales associates came into my office and proceeded to show myself and my boss a doctors note. We had gotten wind of the fact that she was going to try and set up a workers comp claim so we were pretty much expecting it. The HR manager was there already for a different reason anyway so we figured it was a good timing thing anyway. So carol presents her doctors note and my boss reads it, she gets a shocked look on her face and proceeds to hand the note over to the HR manager. The HR manager then asked when she recieved her diagnosis. SHe then explains that it was recent. Now I have been pretty miuch running the operations side of the gallery so I asked some questions as to how and when her injury occured. The HR manger then hands me the note, it says and i kid you not nature of injury...STRAINED OVARIES...not missing a beat i say difficult to wrap them in an ace bandage! Pretty much stunned the crowd..THe woman who is in her late 50's has been a constant thorn in my managerial side so before anyone can rip out the bulletin on Inapropriate behavior I ask carol How  we can make her more comfortable until her sprain heels. As we are discussing her comfort in my own head i was playing out the examination and diagnosis....

DR: ZO does it hurt when you twist zour ovaries to za right, how about when you twist zem to the left!
DR: DO zhey hurt when zey run, how about when zey do zumping zacks.....
Carol: Yes a bit
DR: Well zen we shall put zem on light desk duty, No physical labor for zem, You know that Sprained Ovaried take much longer to heal zen busted ones, and zoo run de risk of sparaining zem in de future!

After twenty minutes of placating her and her sprained ovaries she leaves my office. I expect to get at least a warning for my comment but the hR manager simply shakes her head, she then turns to leave and simply says ""ace bandage"" shakes her head some more...."

I bust you I ALWAYS DO! Being a cynical person by disposition I will dig and peck to get a semblance of truth. Two recent examples have sprung to mind. First I was supposed to work a party at Tupelos, party started earlier then usual, I wasnt informed and ""my friend"" decides since i dint work the whole party I wasnt getting paid AT ALL! Well I politely reminded him that He screwed up didnt tell me the time and how dare he not pay me anything. He swears that wasnt what he said.....BUT I confirmed it before I called....Heres your Scarlett L put it on.

The second instance is not as blatant but just as vexing to me. If you dont tell me something, and willingly dont tell me even if I call you on it guess what its still a lie in my book."

Firstly I have officialy become an extra in the alternate universe episode of Star Trek...I ended up getting a job thanks to my work experience at CAP...yes spock is indeed wearing the goatee...I am the Merchandise Manager at the Bloomingdales Furniture Gallery. Basically its moving around real expensive set pieces. 

Theatre wise: I play John Smith in RUN FOR YOUR WIFE playing this friday and sat and next fri and sat at NYIT. Its the story of a man married to two women..Go ahead insert your own jokes here 

Still have a few shifts at Tupelos and then Im probably done there. That makes me kinda sad. I have spent over two years there and I do enjoy it but my work schedule makes it hard to work the shifts. 

Also thinking about moving the neighborhood has gone to pot! No just kidding havent seen or heard my erstwhile neighbors in awhile but it could be a good situation but I have a bit mpore thinking to do on it.

ITs pretty cool I work for a technology company that deals with Insurance companies so I'm kinda using my expertie from two prevous life times. Still havent gotten used to this commuting thing and actually getting up early like a grown up again! Its nice to actually get a paycheck again too! 

I am also whileing the Hours Confering with the flowers. Im playing the Scarecrow in THE WIZARD OF OZ at CAP and son of a bitch if they dont have me singing, dancing, and flopping all over the place. Its a role that definately fits me. Im enjoying it and the cast is a hoot. Diane is particulary enjoyable as The Green Menace herself!

Credit Criminal: Yea lets just say too many bills too little money. Honda decided they liked my car and just couldnt wait to get it back. After a little help from friends and not to intelligent repo guys its a past issue. But damn if they all dont keep knocking at the door!

Still Working at Tupelos on Sundays, so if anyone needs a place to Watch the Superbowl It will be on our nice 62 Inch Plasma!!!! Fridge full of Cold ones and I'm Happy!

One final Mis adventure. After Auditions for Music Man I got pulled over by one of Nassaus Finest. He was an asshat who flew by my and then u turned right up my ass. He gave me a field test and a a breathilizer. Wouldnt tell me what I blew but got all indignant with me. Wanted to know why I was at the OBI? Told him I was fighting with my (imaginary) girl friend! He told me to sit on the side of the road. It wasnt late and I hadnt really been drinking that night so I was more than a bit perplexed. That just seemed to addd to his ire. So why is it they always start off nice and polite then by the end they are agitated and almost abusive. HMMMM sounds a bit like my relationships?  SO he peels away and I am left sitting on the hood of my car shaking my head and laughing....

Time for More Adventures SANCHO!"

If you have something to contribute then do so if not then please dont critique those who are making things happen. As a good friend says it time to make sure that Im taking care of my own. I reach limits and then ALL HELL usually breaks loose.I have hopefully wrapped up a new job so that at least some of the financial strains can get eased. It will be nice to be able to do things like eat and buy a DVD AND put gas in the car. This Bohemian life style is exciting but very stressful. As for my erstwhile roomie who has been ""temporarily"" staying with me since August was the first to benefit from my new Doctrine. I thought it was fair to expect him to kick in aftreall he uses my tilities, drinks my coffee and eats my food. He choose door number 2. Ahh well. Note to the Historians  I DONT DO WELL WITH ROOMATES. or more aptly Roomies dont do well with me. 

I bring that Philosophy to the place I am at more often then my apartment And That is CAP. Had a big blowout with Donnie because of shirking of responsibilities. Hes biggest mistake was not admitting he dropped the ball, then upon wondering whu I was mad and when i explained it to him multiple times and he fixated on one point. Namely he was drunk and wasn't accountable for what he said...guess what ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.....

AIDA is up and running and to be honest Im not enjoying it. I cant enjoy my time on stage becuase there is a myriad of tech things which can and will go wrong. Dont get me wrong The ADULT cast is great and most of the kids are dedictaed but a bunch of the CAP brats really need to be plugged up to car batteries and get there BAlls zapped.

But now we are on to Annie! Some of my favoritist people in the CAP world are involved. I get to argue with The Wedding Planner in The Presidential Cabinet, Roust some Bums as The Role I was destined to play. LT WARD!

This was Jason 2.0 or FUCKNUGGETS Gold Edition attempt at a denial. I love how he then uses quotes from LJ that he supposedly doesn't read anymore I found his secret diary where he explains His Devilish Meaning of the quotes.

DUDE: Damn you 1.0 how dare you use such language in a post and Ohh yes I know what it means, it means...Dude. That why I scored so well on that IQ test when I was 7. I got the Block in the Round Hole very quickly, as a matter of fact The instructor said "" He put the square peg in the round Hole way to quick, he is special"" Both Me and My sister Know how smart we are, someday we will take over the world! I'm starting one restaurant at a time, FIRST BUTERAS THEN THE WORLD!

SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY: Damn you Dirty, I know that is code for The Wedding is all about me! I spent Months with the Greatest minds at The Unemployment Office deciphering your Neo Nazi Slogan(e.d. note: This was a quote which was adopted from Forella because it was just that stupid)You May Have kicked My Girl out of your wedding party but know this you may have been the first but you wont be the last!

NO OFFENSE TAKEN...BE WELL: Damn you TMAC, I know you were being devious and making a pass at My GIrl with that remark. Ohh I heard Him when He talked about cleaning his tank. you are Sick! SICK! SICK! 

Well he really showed us. Boy o Boy I have been schooled by the master......"

Training your sister, Even AFTER Matt didn't hire her TWICE, put her on a Saturday during DINNER hour and then having her work on sunday AFTER Matt told you it wasn't cool. Although the topping was trying to sneak her in and have her cover a Monday night shift which you took knowing full well you work Mondays at BUTERA'S.....

"event","Thats how the night could have went but thank you to everyone who supported me as the Narrator this weekend at Rocky. I was actually nervous doing it and to have all of you there was awesome. I enjoyed myself and I enjoyed the show. Allie Henkle is absolutely amazing. I remember her plugging along in YPT shows but damn if Disney knew what she does to the LION KING they would sign her up! The Girl definitely has a future! I couldn't even describe to her mom the next day how talented her girl is, I think the word WOW was about all I got out.

I would also like to Thank Rich Martino. We havent always seen eye to eye on things but I appreciated him asking and then thanking me for doing it. He even made a point of coming up the next day and telling me how much he enjoyed our scene as Doc and Tony in west side. So that kninda brought closure to my Multi Character Weekend. 

Wouldnt have gotten through it though without Diane Marmann my line coach. My best friend is always my best supporter. She helped me figure out who Doc was and when I told her I was considering Sean Connery as the Narrator. She just laughed as if to say like there is anyone else you would do him as! 

To My Fellow Horseman who nailed me with one of the better shout outs RIF Trigger thanks for that! I enjoyed it and laughed almost as hard as the audience.

Again of course Thanks to Dani, Bri, Matt Describe-your-ex-wife's-tits Rubin, Dr. Peekaboo and her string bean throwing accomplice, Pete ""This shows about what?"",Amy and of course Bill Methven who I could see shaking his head more than once! 

Thanks to people like you it still makes doing theses things fun and fresh!"

"event","You ever have one of those days when sometimes it is the stupidest things that just make a crazy day a little better. Well I had one of those yesterday. It was the third day in a row that I was Working at Tupelo's, after working my real job so I was tired and stressed to begin with. This whole week has been a little off. Monday was hectic at AFlAC and then I got to the bar to find nothing done. The icing on the cake was that the tray of sliced fruit was emptied and put in the fridge. I mean the cups were emptied no olive juice remnants, no cherry juice, emptied and put in the fridge. I could go on and on but Im sure Jason has a completely different take on his closing procedure from Sunday Night. So I speak to Matt the Bar Manager and he says ""apparently you guys do it to each other"", because he complains when you close up too! Ahh well so I made sure the Bar was clean and stocked for the bartender on tuesday, which ends up being me again, and wednesday which becomes me again. Thank goodness I set up tuesday night because Wednesday I got slammed at Work and between Traffic and the weather I didnt get there until 5! we already had three tables in there which is unusual for 5. I also was getting grief from My Boss at AFLAC becuase he had a project he needed me to start... so what was it that made me smile you may ask?

About time some of you may say!!!! It was Daiquiri mix...yep Strawberry Daiquiri Mix...One of the Liquor reps was in for dinner and she brought in some. We don't carry it, so I cracked it open, grabbed the Cruzan Banana Rum a fresh banana and proceeded to make Strawberry Banana Daiquiris...Life was pretty good for those few minutes....."

After spending a Night of casual festivities at the Blue Honew(spelling) I was driving Dr Peekaboo home when I noticed that there was Suffolks finest on my tail. I nonchallantly mentioned this fact to her and said that I was quite sure he would be pulling me over. No sooner did these words leave my lips then the Lights came on. 

So i put on the blinker pull over to the curb as Dr Peeekaboo is saying ""Dont tell me this"" ofcourse I said ""I won't""  and grab out Lic, regi, insurance. Put my window down and calmy wait for the Officers to come up to the car. I say officers becuase at that hour two came out, hands on thier guns(its procedure) and lights flashing in the car.

The offficer comes up to my car and ask me A) where I was coming from and B) was I drinking. So I answer A) Diner in Huntington and B) .....NO!!!! I mean really am i going to get a ticket for lieng to boot! The Oficer ask why I was swerving and I said because I was too busy arguing with her..He shook his head and said ""that makes sense"" and he concluded by saying you didnt seem like you were drinking anyway..... So I looked at Dr Peekaboo and as the squad car rolled off , she said that I wasnt drinking that much by my standards....In other words a mere mortsl would be in Suffolks finest custody right now!!!!!!!!!

"event","So its been a crazy few weeks. Between Side Show and hitting ""tech""  rehearsal for Prisoner of Second Avenue, and attempting to get Charlie and the Chocolate Factory together I have just not been home that much. 

Well Saturday we were supposed to Open Second Avenue but the leads ACTUALLY refuse to go on because the set wasn't finished. It was by far the most bush league theatrical stunt I have ever seen. The closest second is sneaking Booze into the most poignant scene in LA MANCHA. Thats almost forgivable compared to this. So my weekend suddenly got freed up. Not only did they force the cancellation of Saturdays show but Sunday as well. So thus began the Marathon clean up of my apartment. I then began cleaning out my many various Fish Tanks. The 40 Gallon Shark Tank, The 30 Gallon Koi Tank, The 30 Gallon Tropical Tank and my centerpiece the 95 Gallon African Cichlid Tank. As I began to clean I noticed one of the Fish being real aggressive. Turns out she was protecting her Kids. It was pretty cool. So I switched foods and began putting in flake food so the babies could eat. 

Monday Night I get home after a CHARLIE HORSE rehearsal and figure I will chill out and finish cleaning the tank. Well I feed them and watch in amazement/ Horror as the proud mother ripped into one fish and then eat her own Baby. Apparently the other fish was planning on dining on it. 

Maybe I'm overly tired, and overly analytical but I swear She looked and said ""Yea I ate my baby"" better I guess then Hearing "" A DINGO ATE MY BABY"" But anyway what I learned

* Never piss of a Mother
* Never Pick on a Kid, NO matter how wrong they are a Mother will still Kick your Ass!
* If the Mother aint Happy No body is happy
* One Day your Happy as Littel Nemo, The next Your one of Nemo's Brothers....
* Sometimes Not even Rocks are safe places to hide"

"event","Just got back from a Night at Tupelos! Its amazing that a ""slow night"" turned absolutely chaotic. Wont knock a night that puts a few bones in the pocket. It still muses me that there are weekend bartenders aplenty there but none of them seem to work the Full weekend shift! There lose , my financial gain this time. The night was made extra special by My Side Show collaborators stoppping in and enjoying some tasty beverages!

Dani sure loves those Key Lime Pie Martinis! so even got Mr Smutko drinking them by the end of the night. Although Adam was enjoying palying pick em and drink em with the new Beer Menu we have.

Jason 1.0 was amused has his good friend Mr Williams were discusiing the many different ways to maje a qulaity drink. He semd to just be relaxing and have a good beer. Nice to see him leave his worries in the trunk for a change!

The Wedding Planner was Chatting with Willie the owner and Her favorite Barkeep while still carrying on a conversation with Jason 1.0 , Danielle and Donnie. Quite the Socializer! 

Pete M was riding the silver bullit express and Donnie Jones our MD was in Key West heaven with MY favorite drink the Key West Lemonade. It was great to see them come up especially since I had to bolt after intermission because I was the only available guy. 

Frankie D. definately nended a good night out after dealing with the School Hose Rock kids, Hes been working hard trying to put up a quality show! . 

I do enjoy when the crew comes up. Its a good night with good people!"

"event","From giving the cricle some fodder. Not that I mind, who knows what rattles around in that collective brain. So Im gonna CRICLE the wagons and not do that. Sure I will Post about winning the Human race at a later date. Still trying to find what channel it is on. Alright so that one was a freebie..anyhow just got back from SPAMALOT! That was one of the funniest things I have seen. Not only was it true to the Monthy Python tradition but it was refreshing in other ways. Its amazing too see true professionals up there. Its one thing to perform its another thing to be funny. We all know people who should sit down and shut up from time to time but to see even the smallest of players in SPAMALOT pulling off bit after bit was hiliarous. Special thanks to The Wedding Planner for putting the evening together!"

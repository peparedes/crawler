How perfect that Alyson Hannigan shall play another band geek. Hey, I know what you're thinking. I do nothing of the sort. I play valve-trombone (flugabone... ) Oh yes, I get to learn trumpet fingerings now! Why? Well, because my new valve-trombone, technically called a ""flugabone"" since it's wrapped up a bit like a flugelhorn, and yet it's in the pitch of an Alto Trombone, is a Bb instrument, thus making me learn to play it differently. Shouldn't be hard at all, though, considering that I have the fundementals down, I'll probably learn them in a day or so. I'll just make a correspondance chart for myself or something.
I've been practicing trombone a lot lately, and I did this impovisation excersize...and finally, my tone just...got good. By God, though, it was amazing! Hah, I sound stupid, don't I? Well, I'm not, I did the most lovely improvizational peice when looking at a peice of artwork. Theres a website called: http://www.trombonelessons.com where it has a creativity excersize, and I played as I've never played before. I'm not even sure what I did play, but it sure did sound good when it was coming out. Good and loud. :D :D :D
We've gotten our Christmas music in band. Ugh...lame Christmas music. We can't even jazz up ""The Christmas Song"" because we're doing it with the choir. Gag.  We have one festival peice too, and the second trombone part sucks. It's a brass quartet empasis in Mozart's Allelujah. Yep, and you guessed it, I'm not in the quartet. Therefore...I have 65 measures of rest, and 4 measures of playing... Yay, at least I can get some knitting done. 
Jazz Band was interesting...considering that we couldn't DO anything. Yes, the substitute teacher came 5 minutes within the start of the first period (Jazz Band is a zero period) and we just sat in the hall talking and wondering where the sub was until finally we had Faulkner (econ. teacher) unlock both the band rooms for us. A few people played Critical Mass, and I sat and stared at them because there was only 10 minutes anyway. Besides, choir girls began to file into the regular band room (why don't they ever go into the Jazz Band/Choir room??) and we just gave up on it.
Hah, what happened in things other than band, you ask?
What is there other than band?
Wow, it's 11pm...I should begin getting ready for bed.
Have a nice night.

"event","Today was un-endearing.
It was cool, then it was stupid, then it was cool, then it was really stupid...from there...it just got stupider.
This morning, as usual, I DID NOT want to wake up to go to band camp (it's a day camp sorta) and I lie there and groaned about my sunburn FROM band camp (ok, and the festival...mostly from the festival, actually) and my loss of appitite that I've had for, like two days (I've only eaten an odwalla drink and a pop-sickle...oh, and that icky band-camp donut...though I only ate half of it) and this huge stomach ache that I had...then I got up, got dressed (slowly, because cotton hurts against second degree burns) put on my shoes, slowly (because converse hurt against zillions of puss filled blisters) took off converse because they suck, and put on mary-janes which STILL hurt.
Then I got yelled at by my mum because I pointed out that Stephy D. and I CANNOT be late to band.
ROAR!
Then blah, blah. We were at school, and we got in the band room, and I put down my huge trombone case. And put on my sunglasses, and got my drill book (well, drill papers stapled together), and my flip-folder and went out to practice <u>THE FIELD SHOW.</u>
Then it really began to suck, because low brass...and low brass only (because we carry the melody of the songs blah blah blah...) get to march with legs up at 45 degree angles... you really have to see us doing this to believe it. I'd laugh if I weren't doing it too.
Then...scavenger hunt...sucks...arrgh. Our campus is HUGE...literally as big as two normal sized high-schools combined. But, we sprinted around campus in already sweaty clothes (uggh...I was wearing my stupid red capris...which suck) collecting stupid clues (Meat-Head Headquarters, Old Rifle Range???) which we got stupider clues from other sections that were racing us to get all their clues before we got ours (Cassidy doing something stupid with his arms was supposed to signify weight-lifting...which signifies dumb jocks... O_O) we eventually got to the end of it. Not with out a proper amount of bitching and moaning, and me getting in trouble by David and the drum-major for sprinting ahead, of course. But we got out.
And what was our wonderful lunch prize but... bologna sandwitches? BOLOGNA SANDWITCHES!??!?! I'm a VEGATARIAN.
Damnit.
Well, that's all my bitching and moaning for today. I'm only chosing not to mention the good things about today because I'm tired, pissed, and achy...

"event","My bottom lip hurts. I just bit really hard into it, which makes me incapable of practicing trombone for a little while...so I figured that I might just write in my livejournal about all the little things I was too tired to write about before.
First of all, for band, the songs are really good. <u><b>Americans We</b></u>, especially, it's stuck in my head right now, even though I'm trying to drown it out with j-pop (I don't want to become fully tired of it before I have to...) I still haven't seen the new band room, I guess we can't see it until band camp. David Duwelle snuck up into it to see what it looked like, though. It's on the top floor, and I guess it's a lot bigger and cooler, and seperate from the choir room. This makes me happy as a clam. Big classrooms are awesome, I was knocking into everyone the other day in the old band room. You can't even <i>move</i> in there...too many music stands and people in one tiny space. 
I'm eating cherry pie right now, it's good. :D I'm kind of stoked, because we have pizza for dinner, even though everything I eat hurts my lip, it still tastes good. I hope it's not too swolen. I guess I can play my trombone anyway, though. I'm really just lazy, and lack the mental capabilities of practicing anything at this moment in time.
Anyway, I met this really cool freshman named Sarah at the music reading, she plays the bass guitar, and she looks like Vanessa Carlton. Stephy D. was stoked over her guitar strap, it was all cool and studded. Her bass was cool too, even though she didn't think so. I called her a slacker since her bass means she'll be in the pit, she doesn't have to worry about right or left! On Monday, when we were marching, I actually bit my left thumb (which is now being kind of wierd and spastic...O_o) to remember my left from my right. I'm such a wierdo. However, I'm pleased to announce that it is very effective, and I <i>do</i> know right from left now...
Uggh, it's so freaking hot. I haven't worked on my comic since last week, I really should if I plan on meeting my deadline, since I just discovered that I have no month of August anymore... since:
a.) starting from August 1st, I'm staying in Colerado for a week
b.) directly afterward, band camp starts
c.) immediately after band camp ends, school starts...
O_o GRRR...deadlines! They suck!
Stephy D. informs me that www.arrrgh-matey.com has been purchased. That is good news to <a href=""http://www.geekular.org"" target=""_blank"">www.geekular.org</a>, since she probably will no longer have the hastle of hosting my sorry butt after that. (Heh, my bandwidth use is probably killing her right now...)
I'm going to go attempt to practice even though my lip is roughly the size of one of jupiter's moons right now...
Catchya later!

I'm wearing a really cute outfit tomarrow too! (I'm so shallow! Clothes, clothes, clothes!

I really want my hair cut tomarrow, and my nails done too! It would be awesome... I just don't know, though!
I'm thinking of getting my hair even shorter this time, and I wan't strawberry blonde highlights! And there was a thingie in Gals! on one of the author notes that had all sorts of different styles of nails she gets. Most girls at school get french manicures, but I so want something different!
Anyway, the style idea was light green with loads of pink jewels, and since that would match my outfit perfectly tomarrow, I really want my nails like that!!
Oh, I'll just have to tell my mum to bring me with her as she gets her nails done, that way I can get mine done too!
Yay! Fun for all!

...mmm, listening to Ayumi Hamasaki, pretending I actually understand it... live really is nice.
Happy July 4th!"

"event","Yesterday the lake was fun...Amy's brother is soooo annoying...I could have strangled him half the time...
But I did have fun all in all.
Today = father's day, though. Therefore, I cleaned the (then disgusting, now spotless) kitchen, did the laundry, washed eons of dishes, vacuumed all the rugs (O_o), made him lunch, cleaned my own room, watered mum's zillions of plants (that was fun, though) and played my flute for him. 
It was such a long time all of it...so now...I'm pooped.
Listening to music...that's all...and eating cheez-its...grr...dad's calling...must go, write later about my magnificent adventures........

"event","I was looking for one of my old bikinis since I'm going to sugar pine, and I found so freaking many that my mum just <i>gave</i> me for no apparent reason. Some of them are from when I was a seventh grader (yes, I was brave enough way back then...) and I began to get nostagic about seventh grade. It's hard to believe that I'm now a sophomore in high school. Seventh grade seems really distant...but not <i>that</i> long ago. I first moved here in seventh grade, and it was such a wierd experience...and now all my best friends are from here, and were all in high school, the people I used to know too (I moved to a town right next to the old one, and there is no high school in my new town, so we go to the one all my old school-mates go to) and, anyway, people I know now and people I knew then are friends...it's just...wierd...
Well, after that, I finally found one that looks good, it has bright turquoise and green checkers and flowers on it. I'm wearing some green checkered boxers and a white sleevless hood vest on top of it. I wear so much green, even more green then I wear yellow. I suppose turqiouse looks good with my eyes, and that's why. Oh, shit. I hope I have some sunglasses...
Well, anyway, later days, my mum just came home and I want to take a shower, etc...

And I've just watched two hours of <b>subtitled CardCaptor Sakura</b>!!! Eeeep! It's <b>sooo cute!</b>
Anyway, I am just dying to swim even though it's not that warm here for some stupid reason...my town is too near the Sierras...
I've decided that I don't really need to diet...I'm whacked for even thinking that I should...I was looking at myself, and all of the sudden I was like ""wait, aren't I a size six?"" and that confirmed the fact that I can still <font color=""orange""><i>un-guiltily</i></font> eat ice cream. :D
My mum got really mad at the BBQ last night, it was kind of amusing, she tried to get it started and it kept not working...she was using a can of empty lighter fluid and <u>FORCING</u> drops out of the poor can, and then the can caught on fire, so she blew it out, and found pine-needles. The pine-needles didn't aid the burning of the poor idiotic coal anymore than the empty bottle of lighter fluid...so I went in giggling and had a bagel for dinner. Jeez, I've been eating a lot of bagels lately...
Hmmm...
Ok, now I'll go practice my flute, <i>wish I had my trombone already</i>, etc...

"event","I just stayed up all night so, I'm naturally just a little bit...lasjkhftu9u43jgngs/gmsfdj...if you know what I mean. I'm going to write in my new LJ until about 4:00 am when I can actually do something productive. Other people are in my house, so it's not like I can be a night-walker, and eat or something. And speaking of eating...I could really go for a blueberry bagel and some soy milk right now. We have blueberry bagels and soy milk, but again, I don't want to wander outside my room.
    It's weird, I don't even have a job yet for this summer. I wish I had a job. Stephy D. has a job. ROAR! Why don't I have a job?! (I know this, I'm just avoiding putting it in print in fear that it will <strike>jinx</strike> me.)
    It's been summer since Thursday (a week ago!) so I guess I'm not expected to be that thoroughly productive yet, but still. I feel so bored already...
    And what will I do tomorrow? NOTHING! Today? NOTHING!
    I wish that I could finally go to the mall with Stephy D., I'm itching for new stuff, and I have approx. $160 that burns a hole. After I get a job there will be no more of this not buying stuff at the mall and being broke riff-raff. Notice that true to my username, I'm being optimistic.
    Hmmm, I was practicing my flute today and it was marvelous, I actually cite read adequately! Go me! Now, I must be able to do this on trombone, and I'm all set for the multiple band classes I'm taking next year! ^_~
    I need to have some summer reading projects (I mean other from my horrible A.P. Euro summer homework and Accelerated Eng. crap...) I wish I had access to a bookstore, but since I live in Hicksville, and the only reason I'm usually around and about is my open campused high school, I'm sitting here re-reading books...a lot.
     Stephy D. must give me books. Or Stephy D. will go to the mall with me. Only Stephy D. because were about the same size, though, and I wont be forced into weird stores that my other friends like going to. Wait, why would I know where my other friends go shopping? It's not like I've been shopping in the last century...haat. 
List of stuff I need:
Flute music book
Amelie on DVD
Feather boa

That Camisole from A&F...it's adorable even though it's from my least favorite store in the world
Sandals that will be decent for marching practice @ band camp...
Sunglasses
    I'll probably end up with about...oh...two of those things from that list.
This summer is far too cold for my liking. I go outside and I CAN wear sweat-pants, and ice cold water on my feet ISN'T appetizing, what is that? I'm supposed to be dead from heat-stroke by now! And all I have to show is a lousy sun-burn! And why I even have a sunburn, and since it's being so overcast that's beyond me. 
   I really should go downstairs and have something to eat...at about six o'clock. I'll bet my parents thought I went to bed. Little do they know...little do they know. I think later I'm going to watch some good and subtitled CCS. It's been a long time since I've been cute-ified, then maybe I'll ask my dad to rent Happenstance. I do so love Audrey Tautou movies. And Legally Blonde. I wish I had both of those movies. I think my life would be ... no different... but oh well.
    You know, I really love playing the flute. I practiced for a nice amount of time today. It made one of those memories, I was so happy. In my mind there is always a snatch of a wonderful time somewhere...ahh...herusement je vive!
    Wow.
    O_O Sooooo...wired...you all are going to read this entry, and go... ""damn...she really was pulling an all-nighter!"" All the same, I'm getting too much sleep lately. I mean, Jiminy Cricket! Sleeping in until noon?! This best no keep up since Jazz Band is 0 period next year... *_* 
     Ah, well, I'm even beginning to bore myself with this entry, so I think I'll just say...au revoir!

"event","Ah! I finally have a livejournal!
I've been using teenopendiary and freeopendiary for the past two years, and I'm so glad that I don't have to use the damned thing anymore! I was tired of the html, the degrading notes, the dumb diaries, et cetera. 
Well, I guess I'll introduce myself to the new journal community. I'm Kat, I'm in marching band, school newspaper, key club, cross-country, link crew, and jazz band. I take accelerated classes, and um dress original.
Whatever.
Anyway, that was lame. Thank you to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/seqsea"">Seqsea</a> for giving me a code. I now am forever done with teenopendiary. Woo-hoo!
Loves,

**HAS ANYONE DONE ANY WORK ON THE FILM ""THE TRACKER""?**

I desperately need help if so, because i suck and i am 
currently quite stuck. Thank you kindly, fine sir.

You know what? Seeing as i am here now, i think i may very possibly write a proper entry, which i havent done since LAST FRIEAKIN year. I am in English a ce moment, and we have a relief techer. We are supposed to be doing our journals or silent reading, but quite obviously i cannot be fuckered doing either.

So, to my entry!!! :)

I stuffed up my whole LJ that i had by trying to do some ovveride shite that was SUPPOSED to make my lj look all nice and pretty with CARE BEARS! (oh how i love them) But insted it screwed it up so that half of the entries were cut out by the care bears covering it and it was just crappy... So then i got rid of that and changed it back to a boring pooey layout and so now it is so. How can i change it back so it is all pretty again, and has my own comments thing... That doesnt say 'comments'? How boring to the max! HELP ME HELP ME!

Anyway, i am curently gererally quite sad. For many a reason. Firstly, Shibby is going away next Thursday forever, to live in Island and that both scares and makes me sad. Adding to this was the fact that i should've had a great time at her party on Sat, but i has a terrible time, because i was in a crappy mood already coz my parents were being arsehooles. I was planning to stay until the end of the party, get parro as, be with Tom (the newly aquired bf - 1 month today); and then after stay the night at shibby's and actually get to spend some time with her too! BUT NO!!! My biatch of a mother rings me from work and says i hadn't said anything about staying the night anywhere and that she would be picking me up at fuckn TWELVE!!! A lot of swearing was said on my part and i hung up on her. SO yes, already in a bad mood. Then Tom decides he's not feeling up to coming about an hour after we got there. So i had no Tom and no alcohol. So, add all that frustration and upsetness and angry-ness and annoyance together, and i was just in a shitty mood and remained so until the bitchface of a mother came and i had to go. I also found out while i was there (from shibbys mum - WHAT A LEGEND THAT WOMAN IS)that my mum had just ""coincidentally"" waslked down the street earlier that day (me n shib USED to live on the same street - til YESTERDAY) supposedly just to have a ""chat"" and she bought up the party and said something like ""Oh, we're just concerned that there are gonna be boys and alcolhol there..."" And Judith (shibs mum) is like ""Uhhhh... Well yes Karen, thats EXACTLY whats going to be there... It IS a teenage party. AND, it is going to be VERY well supervised...""
OMG MY MOTHER IS SUCH A DICKFUCK! OMG WHAT A WANKER.
Ok, so that was one saddening topic. Number 2 is that Tom is being a bit wierd; not replying to my messages very often and always having to go when i ring him, and i suspect that something is not quite right with him concerning moi. I'm thinking that maybe someone told him something bad about me (true or not). I dunno, but its making me sad, coz i like him SO SO SO SO SO SO much, and i would be so sad if i didn't have him. Not to mention no formal date. 
Next matter is the parentals and my brother - who are just getting worse and worse and harder and harder to live with. I HATE IT! I don't really feel like going into that one as i'll be here all day. 

There's also a lot of other not so good things that have been happpening later, but i presume that you're bored by now of hearing about them. That is, if anyone reads this at all.

So yeah, basically my life is not the happiest time at the moment.

But lets move on

I am quite excited about my formal, which is in exactly ONE MONTH TODAY! I (finally) went to the dressmakers last night and she looked at the pic of what i want it like and the colour and measured me all... So it's all getting very exciting! 

what else? Um... I have a maths test next lesson which i am so screweed for. FUCKING hell... i think i will go extremely badly. But thats not really exciting news that anyone actually wants to know.

I got a message from Optus today on my tel-a-ma-phoney and i am quite thrilled because they are replacing free chat (free calls optus to optus from 9PM to 7AM) with some other free call thingy where i can call optus mobile at ANY TIME for free!!! YAY! On that thought im gonna go look up the details on the net, so goodbye my deat friends!!!!!!!!!!!1"

I stayed home from school today, cos i thought i was getting that dammned flu-ish thing that everyone seems to have atm, but by lunch time i was all fit and well again. At least i got a day off school, and got to watch Jerry Springer and Judge Judy, and all those other ab-swinger danoz direct type shows that are just necessary to watch if ur home sick. Todays Jerry springer topic was 'When lovers erupt' It included lots of fat, ugly, whore-ish country hicks, fighting about an equally totally <b>un</b>sexy buck-toothed excuse for a man. So it was pretty much the same as per usual, but entertaining nevertheless. 
I swear, i better have italic and blod text in this here entry, or Chris Murray is going to be in the bad books... yessum. 
My plans for the weekend so far are as follows: Amelias birthday party tomorrow night, Saturday i <i>really</i> need to get my eyebrows waxed, as i am beginning to resemble some kind of strange creature that lives in a closet and eats moths and lint balls. Okay, i've never actually seen one of them, nor am i sure if they actually exist, and i <i>was</i> over-exagerating just a little bit, but u get the general idea... Yeah, and then on Sunday, the plan is lunch and movie with Jason (rain check from last week)
Well, best be of..."

It should die and go to hell, where it should be forced to give satan a xxx bikini wax every day of the year. Or, at least that is what should happen to some of the techers in this shit-hole. Particularly a couple. I shall call them 'Jojo the clown' and 'Mrs Anyone-anyone?' in code, just in the off-chance that this incrimminating information falls into the wrong hands. Ppl who go to my school (i.e. - Elicia) will know exactly who i'm talking about. ARG! the crapness. I'm in Australian studies atm, doing quite a lack of work obviously, as is the case with me and most subjetcs. Surprisingly, i actually quite enjoy Australian Studies. Shacky-shack-shack-shacky-shack (aka Shakira) is sitting over there ---> She loves it when Elicia and I call her that. Sadly, Elicia is not with us today. I think she's bludging, stupid crap face. I want some excitement this weekend. I am supposed to be going out with monsieur Jason. Perhaps that sahall be amusing. Or maybe not. Either way, it'll be something do to, rather than the usual stay-at-home-and-twiddle-my-thumbs routine that i have seemed to got into lately. I don't think that last sentence was a very good use of English. Oh well, i suck. In other breaking news, mon pere is an absolute dick fuck. He has an oh-so-wonderful (*plz note sarcasm*) new sceme, which is this: Even though we have a dishwasher, from now on, my brother (Sean) and I will be HAND washing all the dishes, because we dont APPRECIATE the dishwasher, and we take advantage of it...

On Friday during the day, i had to do a liturgical dance thingy with the drama group in front of the whole of CBC at their mass. That was fun; there's this part in it where i had to get lifted up, and had to balance on Adrian and Geoffs hands while being thrust high into the air. It was cool fun! Friday night, i went to the SAC musical, 'Bats', which was fantaaaaaaaaaaaaastic, especially Claire and suzie!!! Theeeeeen, on Saturday i went to watch Emily, Elicia and Kirsty competeing in the States (for Irish dancing) and thyey were mighty fine also. Spending the day there reminded me how much i don't miss it. Hmmm, yes and today i was supposed to be haveing lunch and seeing a movie with Jason, but he bailed on me because he's sick... poor baby (note the sarcasm) So, that is not happening. U see, its not that my weekend was bad, its just that i didnt do anything that made me go ""WOW! i wanna do THAT again!"" Never mind, these things happen. I think i shall be off togo play a few rounds of isketch. I suggest you do the same. Visit: <www.isketch.net> Lotsa fun!!!"

"event","YAY! I finally worked out what i was doing wrong with the comments thing. I though that ""screen"" would make the comments visible to other ppl, and vice-versa. Yet, when i actually READ the information about the comments on LJ, i discovered that i was, as is a common occurence with me, wrong. Nevertheless, everyone can now see all my spen-didily-en-did comments... YAY! i say YAY! Anywhoo, on to other news, after school today, i had detention and had to dust every single god damned windowsill in the school. The degree of suckage ws quite high, i can tell you. I wouldn't recommend it as a leisure activity. Also, today in music, Mr. Wijeyeratne was teaching our class (By class, i am referring to all TWO members of it - Meagan and I) and he was teaching us about how to produce an a carpella choral arrangement. So, for an example, he used 'Mary had a little lamb', but we changed it, and renamed it 'Mary had a dada lamb"", with the middles and altos singing a range of 'wu-tangs' and 'fubus' in place of the usual 'oohs' and 'ahhs'. Anyone who knows me well will understand me and my feelings towards these subjects. (*shudder*) So it was all very funny... Oh how i chuckled. haha. 
Another thing. I think the roles of families, particularly parental unitls, and especially in my case, siblings of the male variety, is solely to suck as much as is humanly possible. That's my wise theory #1. I'm sure there will be many more to follow. I think that i might actually make a list of wise theories and rules which all people of the earth should live and be governed by. I shall be content when my list reaches 100. Then all i have to do is get everyone to comply to what will be an absolutley fan-bloody-tastic sceme,everything will be just fine and dandy. Good-oh. 1 down, 99 to go.
In other beaking news, i have decided that i want to write to a detainee in one of the camps. So, that is what i am going to do. I emailed the dudey, and he sent me sumone to write to. The information they gave me about them, wasn't very, how shall i say... informational? I thought it was rather amusing really.
This is what it said:
Known Information
Age: unknown
Name: Rejwar Ako
Sex: kid
Nationality: probably Afganistan
hmmm... yes. Thats what i thought to. Oh well, hopefully my letters will brighten up his/her day.

It's Independence day today, and there are no classes. (Yipee!)

However, I still have tons of homeworks to do. Guess what? Laziness strikes again.

We have a new subject, it's Astronomy. It kinda reminds me of Harry Potter ^^

Our teacher in Chemistry was a bit loony last Thursday. We had a short quiz about the branches of Science, which was an easy topic, but our teacher just dictated the test. He read it a bit too fast.. I got 14 over 15, which wasn't so bad, I suppose. But the thing is, our teacher said that the people who got 14 and below will have 0 score, and the ones who got fifteen will have perfect score, of course. It was so unfair, I only had one mistake. T_T"

"event","Waahh!! It's the first day of school today.. And yeah, I'm incredibly exhausted. Our teachers seem to love torturing their students with numerous assignments everyday, and today isn't exempted. They started with giving us tons of requirements, and I definitely went to a department store to buy those. But oh my, the place was full of people! I squeezed my way in, and almost suffocated all the way. Imagine, that small place was jam-packed with people also looking for school supplies, some were rude enough to curse despite of the people around.

Currently, I'm searching the net for my assignment: meaning of economics, investment, types of business, bookkeeping, yada, yada.. I bet our lessons are a lot more advanced than those from other schools, we're already taking up lessons in college!"

"event","Hello, everybody! I have finally made an account... Yeah, I'm a newbie here. So... It's summer vacation, and of course, there are no classes. I'm quite busy writing fan fictions nowadays. Well, I'm not actually forced to write, it's just some kind of hobby or something. I'm currently writing stories about Gakuen Alice, or Alice Academy here in Philippines."

"event","Well, we're off to a rip-rarin' start in this year. Tomorrow was supossed to be my court date.

Let me explain:

Back in December - the fifth, to be precise - a buddy of mine and I were on our lunch break. I live in arizona where only about 20% of the roads are actually <i>paved</i>. Now, being the geniuses that we are, we decide to take his crappy little Buick sedan onto one of the aforementioned dirt roads and pass a few minutes. Now, I'm a good driver. One might even go so far as to call me an <i>excellent</i> driver. So I'm driving my buddy's car along these relatively tame dirt roads. They're quite flat and not very pebbly, so I decide to crank it up and see what his car can do. It was one of <i>those</i> days. Anyway, all's going swell until the back tire blows out at about 90 miles per hour. I know what to do in these situations. I take my foot off the gas and wait for the car to slow to a calm, serene stop on a road overlooking the beautiful mountains. Well, as I said before, we were doing a good 90 M.P.H. so this was easier said than done. the car goes over a dip in the road. Nothing terribly serious, but it makes the car swerve to the left. Dramatically. The car slides along until it finds another dip in the road (I swear, they appeared after I drove over that part of road the first time.) and the car flips. Several times. I black out. When I wake up, the car is on it's side and John (aforementioned buddy) is screaming at me from outside the car. I glance around and notice the car is lying on the driver's side. I unhook my seat belt and black out again. This is what freaks me out. When I come to again, I am squatting outside the car, leaning against the <i>roof</i>. Now, I have no idea how I got here. John is not a... physically strong fellow, so that rules out hiss ass dragging mine out of the car. Also, the paramedics have not yet arrived. Now you see my confusion. Anyway, I stand up and walk over to where John is on his cell with 911. It's not until I get there that I think to myself, ""Hey! My ankle hurts!"" so i sit in the dirt as the ambulance pulls up. I blacked out again a couple times as they were checking us out, and realized later it was because I smacked my head hard on the steering wheel. So they put me on a stretcher and pop me into the ambulance and off we go to the hospital. When we get there, I'm a little more with it, so they X-Ray my ankle. Just a sprain, no fracture. Thank the GODS. THen they tell me they're gonna give me a C.A.T. Scan to see if I have any concussions. Turns out I dont, so they wheel my back into the room so I can make some calls as they finalize the paper work. Who's the first person I call? My girlfriend Stef... tho thinks I'm kidding. Well, I convince her I'm not, and she starts freaking out on the phone. I tell her she can come see me, so she heads right over. As I hang up, the nurse walks by and informs me that my parents had been called. They never were. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I call my boss and tell him I was in an accident and wont be in for a while. (Why was I so calm after being in a could-have-been fatal roll over?) So he sends his best, blah blah. Then a cop comes up and asks me some questions about the accident. Apparently, the ""posted"" (I use the term loosely, as there were no signs out there.) speed limit was 25. I'm thinking ""Fuck, criminal speeding, he's gonna arrest me. Apparently the car rolled 480-somethin feet. He asks me how fast we were goin. I said about 60. Which we <i>were</i>... for a few seconds. Anyway, turns out, the cop only cites me for driving too fast to control and tells me I have a court date on the third of January. He leaves, and a minute later, Stef shows up, pale as a ghost. She walks over and very delicately hugs me and sits down by my bedside. We talk for a while, and I wonder why my parents weren't there. It was now about five o'clock. So, I decide I'll wait in the lobby for another 10 minutes. Stef calls her parents to tell them where she is. <b>They</b> rush over and offer me a ride home. I accept, giving up on my own parents. I get home to my mother sitting with a very confused look on her face. She asked me what happened. I asked if she'd gotten the call. She asked what call. So I explained. Stef went home. Turns out, not only had the hospital not called my parents (I know it isn't proceedure, as I am 18, but the nurse said they had called, and one sort of tends to believe a <i>nurse</i>.) SO my dad gets home shortly thereafter. More explaining. 

Insert a <b>long</b> week of healing and medical paperwork. Follow that with three <i>more</i> weeks. That brings us to the present. 

Now, Stef's father is a cop. Her mother works in the court. The very court I was supossed to go to. Turns out Stef's mother decided to play saint and save my arse. She is going to give me information on enrolling in traffic school. Doing so makes it so that, not only do I not have to appear tomorrow, but I walk away with no spots on my record, and my lisence still intact. 

I owe my soul to my girlfriend's mother."

"event","Well well, welcome to my little ramblings and ravings. MY name is Robbie and I will be your guide into the crazy, nonsensical world that is my life. Seeing sas it is a new year, I thought it was high time I take the plunge into the world of blogging. Why, you ask? Because I have nothing better to do than share my lives with hundreds upon thousands of strangers. So, pull up a comfy chair, grab some munchies, and enjoy your stay."

This is my informal apology for those two artists in high school I refused to like. 
Maya, Conor, I'm sorry. I was wrong. 
Was it pride or bad taste? We'll never know. (*cough* it was both *cough*)
(Or was it that I&nbsp;was too in love with TMBG to have any love left over? Probably not.)

Is my pennance that i actually pay real life money for Arular or Fevers and Mirrors?&nbsp; 
Maybe. 
But if you know me, you'll know that if i end up at CD&nbsp;central I will buy Belle and Sebastian's BBC Sessions. 
You cannot deny that obvious truth. 

Also, did you know M.I.A is having a baby?&nbsp;Whaaat?&nbsp; 
Also,&nbsp; is anyone else kind of suprised at how popular she's gotten? 
Galang on a car commercial is one thing, paper planes everywhere is something else. 
I mean. I guess society does sometimes like good things. 
But if I ever hear Paper Planes at somewhere where it is obviously out of place again, I will destroy everyone. 
or actually, i'll sit there and give whatever soroity girl that screams, 'oh god i love this song' the evil eye, my friends will roll their eyes reminding me that i'm being the elitist bitch I am.
Especially since I don't like M.I.A. like a crazy person. I'm a casual fan. 
But it is still kinda annoying, right?&nbsp;

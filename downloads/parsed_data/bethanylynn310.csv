"event","today megan pulled me out of bed at 8 am to go running. we had fun. 
then i went to work....not so much fun, but i did remind mike that this was to be my last day ever. he didn't remember but i refreshed his memory. he said i could keep working there till i find another job, which is cool. 
then i got my senior pictures in the mail, dont really like them. 
then i helped my sis make dinner. i had to run to the store to get salad stuff.
did i mention that i'm learning how to drive a stick shift? well i took my dad's truck (standard)to the store for practise. i did good except when i went to leave and forgot about the parking brake. that was a little embarrassing but i remembered after about 4 stalls. 

so then i go to the movies  with liz and joy (again in the truck, i did much better), we saw ""mean girls"" which was good. some girls at venice could benefit from watching it.
 
then we went to bresler's and i asked if they were hiring. at first they said probably not, then i told them i had been at steve's subs (mike has a deal with them, discount subs for discount ice cream) for two years and they were like ""well actually check back next week"". 

then we went for a walk on the beach. 

all done"

i went to her house this afternoon, and we watched bits of ""Selena"". aaron said that he watched that movie and felt sad that she died until the end when they showed the real Selena (not jennifer lopez)...then he was like ""whatever""."

then i skipped youth group.
well not totally skipped, i went and practised and sang then i left. i guess i was celebrating the fact that i'm 17 and no longer a pastor's daughter. me and liz went driving around (because there's nothing to do in venice) then met up with everyone at dairy queen.

this morning i woke up at 6.45 (yes, on a saturday). i had to work the sidewalk sale at the church we had to raise money for our mission trip this summer. so i worked there from 8-10. at 10.30 i was at work. i was was really tired before i got there, so it was a super long and exhausting day. however, liz and mindy came to eat lunch so that part was fun. after what seemed like 3 days of being at work, i finally headed toward my car in the First Baptist parking lot.  as i got closer, i saw that all this stuff was on my car! there were post-it notes ALL OVER IT. they all said ""c-ya after work"". i was so surprised that i just stopped and laughed out loud then looked around to see if whoever did it was still there watching my reaction. it took me about 10 minutes to get them all of my car. by then i had pretty much figured out that it was liz and mindy. it was. 
that made me so happy, i forgot about how tired i was.

i entered this drawing on 96.9 FM earlier this week and I actually won. God is incredible. 
I have to go to Fort Myers sometime next week to the radio station to pick it up and ""something else very special"", whatever that is. 
after school me and elizabeth went to the mall where we looked in about 6 stores and finally found the perfect shoes for my Cotillion dress (which is tomorrow). Orginally they were $40 dollars, but when i went to pay for them, they were only $12!!! After that we all went to the basketball game and then to Bogey's.

on saturday night i was driving to the dejong's property with liz. i turn onto their drive, which is a really narrow dark dirt road, with palms and bushes on either side, and these huge brights lights turn onto the road headed towards me. this truck is taking up all the room on the road and i know we'll have to pass so i dont really know what to do. liz says ""oh that's andrew's truck (her older brother)! i dont know what he's doing"" so the truck keeps coming and we're wondering why the heck andrew is taking up the whole road. so i finally pull into the brush on the side of the road and stop and roll down my window. the truck's lights are blinding me. when the truck gets close enough i say/yell: ""what are you DOING?"" 
""i'm gettin' outta here""
it's not andrew. this guy's as old as my dad."

servant leaders was good too.

at about 9.30, amanda got really tired, so we decided to head home.

i got home from work exhausted because i only slept about 5 hourse last night, so i took a nap and accidentally skipped interact, which isn't good because i'm on probation already. and i've been doing homework for about 4 and a half hours and i'm not done.

until about 11.30 when i went to go to bed. i brushed my teeth, washed my face, got into my pj's, and climb in and reach for my book on the dresser beside my bed. funny.....its' not there. so i get out of bed and look under it to see if maybe it fell down. nope, not on the other side either. it's not anywhere on the floor. it's not on megan's bed or in the chair. not in my room. so i look in the computer room. not there. nor is it in the den, kitchen or living room. so i look everywhere again, turning on lights and certainly waking up me parents. 
then it dawns on me......megan.
so i call her cell phone from home, leaving a specific message to call-me-on-my-cell-phone so as not to wake the parents. 2 seconds later the phone rings. my parents are REALLY anal about people calling late at night. more than once they've embarrassed me by talking to my friends about calling late. guess who's calling? megan.
""i TOLD you to call my cell"" i say just as both of my parents pick up a phone and ask whats wrong. i settle that then ask megan if she knows where my book is. 
""what book?"" she asks
""the one i was reading"" i say
""oh....(giggle) yeah....i brought it with me""
""what? why did you do that if you knew i was reading it?""
""i didn't know you were reading it""
""well it was sitting beside my bed""
""i'm sorry!""
""fine, go get it and start reading to me where i left off"" i know this is kind of absurd but taking someones book while they're in the middle of it is like turning off a movie someone is watching and taking off with it. SUPER annoying. 
""i can't, i have to go to the bathroom"" and she hangs up. so i call her and call her and call her. she doesn't pick up.

Why this painful memory
Can never find its way to you from me

And I can't dial the phone just now
Even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue

"event","So I decided to write in both journals again. A LOT of you have e-mailed me asking to update my LJ because you all think it's stupid I stop updating it because of the circumstances. 

SO....I have an update for you and a promise that I'll write in here at least once a week. Anyway, let's dive in shall we?

For the first time in almost 20 months I went on a date. GO ANDRU. WHOO HOO...

It actually all goes back to Tuesday. I got the courage up to talk with this girl  that goes to our church and play's the piano and sings in our group. I'd noticed her before but because I was in a relationship at the time I never said anything to her, and I thought she was WAY out of my league too. 

So anyway, we started talking between sets at practice on Tuesday. Mostly about music and stuff like that and I casually said ""well we should talk more often""  and then and we exchanged MSN names and then left. 

So twenty minutes later I get home and she got online. We talked for a couple of hours about who we are and things like that. Turns out she's just as into music as I am and things like that.  She has the same taste of music that I have that most people don't have. SHE LIKES SUPERTRAMP! Which is something that I rarely ever find. AND She's played the flute and piano and some other instruments for a few years and she can sing quite good. 

We found that we have so much in common when it comes to our lives and that our personalities are somewhat the same.

So as we were talking I casually asked her if she wanted to go to my Company Christmas party on the 6th and she said yes and she seemed kind of excited about it. 

We talked some more and before she went to bed I asked if she wanted to hang out on Friday (last night) and she said yeah.So we talked on Thursday and made plans to hang out. 

So last night came and I went to pick her up and I took her to Baked Expectations. There we chatted it up about our lives, trips we've taken, innocent stuff like that...As we were talking I asked  it was an official  date or not and she said yeah which was good to know. Then the topic of past relationships came up.

 I told her all about my 19 month relationship with Erin and how it was a learning experience and things like that. I told her that it was a nice relationship but that she changed and that she wanted to go her own way which was understandable. Plus the distance didn't help.

She understood and told me the story of her year and a half relationship and things like that. It was good information to know. Turns out he actually went to Mexico for a while.

Then we somehow found out that this was the first date that the two of us have had since our relationships, so after that we weren't so nervous.

Then we went to sugar mountain and took a quick look around and then to my house to show her where I lived  and then we just drove around and talked about some of the bad things we've done in life. Like the time I ditched and went to Boston and she told me some crazy stuff about her which was pretty funny.

So all and all It was a good date, she also mentioned she'd like to do it again. There No goodnight hug but that's okay...rumor has it she's shy and that's understandable.

She's actually Jessica's Cousin (Jessica from VW and church) so I have the insiders help which is always good.

Anyway, we saw each other at church today in the little meeting and then we talked online after words for a half hour. We're going to talk some more later this weekend and then she's come over next week. 

I hope things work out with her. She's incredibly sweet and we're so alike it's crazy.  Also with her recently getting out of a year and a half relationship herself it makes it that much easier since so we're both new to this whole ""dating"" thing. 
It's actually quite funny and cute at the same time.

So anyway, that's the same posted I put in my DJ. Wanted to keep those of you that don't have an DJ updated

I'll keep you posted.

"event","I'm the official events coordinator for the Uberwagen VW Club here in winnipeg. Next year we are having a huge Canadian VW show and I'm the one that's in charge of planning it and making sure things go well. It's been crazy trying to get everybody from across Canada to come but I'm sure with constant advertising I'll get enough people. 

Things in Winnipeg have been crazy. Work is driving me nuts. Pet plan is seriously a revolving door! People are being hired and fired left and right...in the words of Homestar.

<i>""They were kicking people off and kicking people on I mean it was just crazy man, people are going to be talking about this for a long time""</i>.

It's just been intense.

I'm working on Vetsuite and helping clinics set up their home pages on the web because out of the five of us trainied I'm the only one that understands how it works. It get's hectic sometimes.

Let's see what else. I've been djing like a mad man which is okay. I guess The Downs likes me a lot because I'm the best dj they've ever had. They offered me full time but I had to turn it down because pet plan comes first.

Um. Other then that...nothing else to report. I don't write in here much anymore. I mostly write in my dead journal...and you have to be a friend to read it.

Anyway, I'm out.

"event","Yeah, it seems like things are kinda back to a norm lately. Unfortunetly I'm missing out on a lot of things back home. My friends keep me up to date for the most part. Meg from WHS found my journal the other day which was cool cause I hadn't talked to her for a while. Everytime I look in the year book and see the picture of her taking a picture I laugh because the camera she used was my camera and she borrowed it to use it for that picture..lol. Good times.

I can't believe it's been a year and two months since we've graduated. I feel like it's gone by too fast. I sometimes miss high school cause the responsibilty compaired to what I'm doing now was much less. CDO was awesome, I will never forget how much fun I had at that high school and then came WHS and I had some good times and bad times there. I think my senior year was probably the most active year when it came to activities. WHS offered a lot more then CDO did, eaither that or I actually took the time to pursue things at WHS. 

I miss HCC too though. Man, those first few months of College was great. Why did I have to go and fuck it up? I had a lot going for me! Shit that sucks you know? You think you have everything sorted out but then you fuck it up. It's not cool. At least now though I know what needs to be done when I go back to college. I need to slow down and take classes that I know I will focus in. I need to work on my attendence...just because the professers don't care that you're not there doesn't mean that you shouldn't go...I found that out the hard way. 

I dunno. I guess I just miss living care free like a teen ager. I'm an adult now by all goverment standards. I had to leave America to fix my debt problem and as much as I thought I hated America, I miss it so much. I may be Canadian and proud of it, but I am so use to living like an American and until I move back down there I will feel different...like I don't belong here.

I need to figure out what the hell I'm doing in my life. I know I'm not going to be in Winnipeg forever and I know I will eventually move back to the states. It's just a matter of when and where. I also know Erin and I will be together forever but we have to start planning what road we are taking and where we want to be in two years.

Anyway, speaking of doing things...I have to get back to work. Mind you it's dead and I've only had two calls in fourty five minutes.

Yuck, I shouldn't have drank that cup of coffee. Eww.

Hope everyone has a good day."

"event","I feel as if I owe it to everyone that reads my journal that I write with what's been going on in my life.

So I think I'm going to have to start at the beginning of the move and work my way down. This could take a while.

So the last day in Westfield sucked. It was rainy and it totally fit my mood. I played Audio Slave's <i>Like a stone</i> a million times in a row as I left. I kept thinking about my Erin and how I was going to miss her. It was hard but I had to deal with it.

We took the long wet drive up through Vermont and made it into Quebec where I had dinner with Grandma and Grandpa and Craig and Mom. It was okay. I was kinda anxious to get out but I regret it now. 

Finally Dad met me up at the Donut place and I said goodbye to Mom and Craig and whatever was left of my normal life. Looking back on it now, I left it all behind and I was forced to grow up. 

It was hard to say goodbye. I mean shit. I've lived with my mom for 19 years and yeah we had our problems, but I honestly didn't think that I would leave her like this. I always imagined moving out on my own and never in with dad. I guess things change.

In the car on the way to Montreal the rain started to fall again and dad filled me in on what was going on in his life. Kristen had decided to move into another house and leave him this house and take a break from living with each other. It was killing him inside and seeing him sad because he lost his love life made me even more depressed because it reminded me of what I was going through with Erin being left behind in Westfield. He was a wreck and so I was I. 

We went to three different stores to see if we could find something to ship some of my clothes in since one of my bags weighed more then 70 pounds. And then we headed back to the hotel.

It was the same hotel we stayed at last year prior to our trip to Halifax. It was at that hotel that I missed goobie once last summer. And it was this hotel were I cried because I was actually moving away from her. It was so hard. You know how when you forget about all the little things when your in a relationship or friendship and it's only after words you realize how those little things add up to make that relationship/friendship what it is? That's exactly what happened. Everything little that Erin had ever done for me that I took advantage of now left me. 

The next day we woke up early and caught our flight that would lead us to Toronto. As I bordered the plane I slept to the sounds of Dave Matthews and again Audio Slave. <i>""In your house, I long to be""</i> Those haunting lyrics making me even more depressed then I already was.

We stopped in Toronto for a little over an hour and snuck off to the VIP Air Canada Lounge. There we saw some big shot VIP Canadian government official surrounded by people worshiping the ground he walked on. Whatever...I hate big shot assholes.

Then we loaded our plane and I left the city I was born in, bound for Winnipeg.

When we arrived, I was welcomed by Kristen who gave me a hug and was the first to say ""welcome home"". Those words hit me harder then anything you could imagine. I didn't want this to be my home. This was my last resort.

We went to breakfast at a cute place over by Assiniboine Park, I think it was called the star cafe. We talked about everything and me of course could not stop talking about Erin.

When we came back I unpacked and moved in and made my room feel as comfortable as I could. It wasn't the same, and for some reason it still isn't.

Work started the next day and there I went through my HED/Petplan orientation. I was introduced to everybody and for some reason I was scared shitless. This was my first ""real job"" (retail jobs and six flags don't really count). 

The rest of that week consisted of various training video tapes and hours of listening to inbound and outbound calls. It was interesting, but I learn better hands on.

That Friday night, I went to a bar called Fin McCues over at The Forks, just outside of the exchange district. I enjoyed a few beers and a traditional Irish fish and chip platter.  The music was kicking and I was feeling a little better...then again I drowned my sorrow in a glass of beer. 

I paid the bartender, went to the ATM and took out some cash and was on my way back up to the river walk.

It was there that ten fucking assholes ganged up on me, threatened me with a knife and took five dollars and the watch that Erin had given to me. I was heartbroken and depressed. The one thing that I wore everyday to remind me of my girlfriend was stolen by a group of street kids. 

I ran up the hill and called the police from my cell phone. The operator confused me for a girl and wasn't patient with me at all. Because I was crying she felt she could sigh and huff and puff. She told me to go wait in the lobby at the Fort Gary hotel and wait for the police and then threatened to hang up on me. I told her I was keeping her on the phone until I made it to the lobby of the hotel.

When I arrived I hung up the phone and asked the doorman if I could use their phone. I called dad and told him what happened and he couldn't believe what he had heard. He told me he was on his way and I hung up. A guest came up and asked about what had happened and gave me twenty dollars once he heard my sad story. It cheered me up a little bit and then I was given a smoke and a cup of tea to calm my nerves. 

Dad showed up before the police did and took me to the restaurant where him and some business partners were having dinner. I felt so awkward being there. I was ready to cry and shaking the whole time but I played it cool. 

Lee tried to comfort me with stories of his past and how he got robbed, but it didn't help. I felt dead in the heart and dead all around.

We finally arrived at home where the Winnipeg Police department met up with me.
They interviewed me and asked all sorts of questions and I told them the sad story which was now burned into my memory. 

I gave them descriptions of as many as I could remember, but unfortunately it didn't help me feel any better.

They left around 11:30 and at that point I burst into tears and Kristen gave me a huge hug. It was so hard, and to this day I still don't feel safe. The added paranoia was not something I needed.

The next work week started and things continued to get better. Training continued, and besides one of my managers talking about me behind my back, things were good.

I finally completed my training the same week I was going to Westfield. I was now ready to go on the phones.

The morning of the fifteenth I purchased my second car. A Black 2003 VW Golf CL standard with tinted windows. I was excited and I wanted it then and there. Unfortunately it wasn't ready to be picked up, and even if it was I wouldn't be able to drive it considering I have never driven standard before.

After that I purchased my insurance and registration and was on my way to the airport.

I cleared customs and I felt so much better. I was on my way home and even though it wasn't forever it was still enough to hold me over. 

On the plane I met a great person who I talked to from Winnipeg to Minneapolis. She was 22 and had a great job and had been to more countries then I had ever been to.

In Minneapolis we went outside and talked while she smoked. She was very nice.
She gave me her number and told me to call her and we would hang out. I knew I wouldn't call, but I kept it anyway.

Finally Hartford was my next stop. I was that much closer to home.

When I arrived, dinner was waiting for me and I had dinner with my family for the first time in two weeks.It was my favorite meal, shepherds pie made the way I liked it. 

Then it was finally time to see my Erin.

Mom drove me over to her house and when I arrived I got the biggest hug Erin had ever given me. It was one that I remember now as I write this. It literally knocked me on the couch it was so tight. I was so happy to be back at Erin's. it's my second home. We watched tv and cuddled and I didn't want to let go. It was just like old times. 

Prom was the next day and we didn't see each other much in the morning. Mom and I went to the mall where I got my hair cut and then I picked up my tux.

I got all cleaned up and headed over to goobies house. I can still see her waving to me at the front door. She looked so good, so wonderful and so beautiful. It's something I will remember for the rest of my life.

We took a million pictures and then went to Chez Josef. We danced the night away and mingled with friends. It was a night that was magical.

After words we went back to her house and crashed like old times. Around 1:30 Mr. Johnson woke us up and took me back home. Being a sleep in her arms was the most safest and comfortable I had been in a long time. I didn't want to leave.

The next morning was family picture day so we went to Holyoke Mall and Craig Tanya and I got our pictures taken. Erin sat by and kept me company while the photographer flirted with me. It was scary. 

We all went to lunch at Friendly's after and then split up. Tanya Erin and myself wen to the watch store where Erin and myself bought my replacement watch. It felt like old times and I had forgotten I was going back home to Winnipeg.

Sunday came and unfortunately I had to say goodbye all over again. Erin came with us to the airport and said goodbye to me. I didn't cry in front of her, but on the flights back here I did. it was even harder. I know I won't see her again till Christmas. 

I came back and was greeted by Dad, Riel and my new car. It was so cool to have a new car of my own. The first song I ever played in that car was of course a Dave Matthews song ""what would you say"" to christen my car. 

I came home and unpacked all of my stuff and tried to get comfortable. But it just wasn't home. 

I learned to drive my car that week while Dad was out of town. I was proud of myself. By the end of that week I had learned how to drive and was comfortable enough driving it to and from work. While he was away I also got to drive his VW pssat so it was kinda cool.

I made one of my first friends from work that week. Jen invited me to lunch at her place where we had mac and cheese. It was so hard. That was something Erin and I made a few times. 

Harley would have been the second friend I made. The following week we went to five bars and I learned about Winnipeg and other various shit.

I was making sales and doing well on outbound calls and then they started me on in bound.  

CRM (Claims Risk Management) calls were coming in left and right and people were bitchy. But I dealt with it. Sales continued to increase and I finally learned how to drive and master my car.

Money was still an issue which lead to many arguments with my father about how I can spend my money and how I can't.

This leads us to today. Things are still smooth with Erin and I and I believe they will be for a long time. It's hard, I'm not going to lie. I miss her more and more each day and Christmas feels like it's never going to come here. We both cry at night sometimes and it's hard for us to say goodbye on the phone or online.  We'll get through it. If it's meant to be, it will be.

Erin and I talk every day or try to. If I'm at work we e-mail back and fourth. 

Things with dad are still interesting. I don't know how well they'll progress but I'll continue to cross my fingers.

Friends are slowly becoming more frequent and it should help now that I have a second job as a club DJ on Friday and Saturday nights. 

I'm starting to get to know the city a little which is okay. I still don't feel comfortable going places by myself so I stay inside as much as I can.

Every morning I still wake up not realizing that I'm still here. I keep hoping I'll wake up back home, but it doesn't happen. I sigh and roll out of bed and try to move on but whenever I close my eyes images of Westfield pop into my head and I become warm.

Something tells me that things will be okay sooner or later. I'm a strong believer in ""whatever happens happens"" and ""everything happens for a reason"". There is a reason I'm here, and I may not know it now, but sooner or later it'll be obvious why I'm here. If it's meant to be it'll happen.

I know I'm not going to be here forever, but I don't know what the future holds. 

I read in a book I was reading a paragraph that helped me realize what life is about.

And it is with that paragraph that I leave you tonight.

<i>""Every  so often, every day, you are going to lose. Nobody is going to give you anything out here, and you will be knocked down. But you gotta stand back up again and keep moving forward. That's what life is. Picking yourself up and living to fight, and win, another day.""</i>

"event","Yeah so I haven't written in a while. Sorry. I've been really busy.

I'll update you as much as I can in the fifteen minutes I have.

I started work a week and a half ago. It's been going well so far. I think I'll do fine once they release me on to the phones.

I got robbed at knife point the other week and they ran off with the watch that Erin gave me as well as five dollers. Jerks. There were about ten of them! Can you believe that? Honestly all that trouble for a watch and five dollers? Yeah okay..assholes.

Things at home seem to be going well. For the most part it's just me and my dad, or sometimes just me, which is fine because that gives me time to relax and get over some things I'm still dealing with. Hey, nobody said moving was easy.

Erin and I are in the talks about me flying her up here this summer to spend a week in Oosyoos with my family and myself. So far it looks promising. It's about a 90% chance on her side and about 50% chance on my side (Dad and I are still in the talks).

So far, no ""real"" friends, but that could change. I'm suppose to hang out with some people from work this weekend (hopefully) and if that goes well then we'll see what happens. 
I think I forgot how to make friends.lol...it's so easy back in school. Then you get out to the real world and you're like ""hmm...wow...this is fun...."" I feel like homer simpson in the episode where bart discovers a metor is crashing down.

Homer starts to twiddle his thumbs like ""Dooo do do do do do do doooooo do do, dooooo do do do do do dooooo do do"". That's how I feel sometimes.

I go back home in 7 days. Erin and I will spend as much of it together as we possibly can, and then I'll have to say goodbye for an uknowen amount of time.

We should be fine considering we have all these plans to see eachother again. I don't think saying goodbye will be as hard as it was last time. We seem to be doing fine now, and if things continue that way and all goes well. We should be fine.

Well that's a quick update for you, I can't really go on too much right now since work is about to  begin. But hey...I'll keep you posted. ""I schwear"".

On Saturday April 26th, 2003. I will no longer be living in Westfield Mass.
I will be moving to Winnipeg Manitoba Canada to live with my father.

The reason for this move is because of the $24,000 job that I have received for <a href=""www.petplan.com"" target=""newwindow"">Petplan Insurance</a>. 

I will still update my live journal as much as I can to keep everybody informed as to what's going on in my life.

So there you go...there is an update. Questions? Eat something!

"event","Yeah...I was glad to be home in my own room for about two minutes. Then my mother comes out and started on me. Yeah, you can tell I'm back home.

I think the thing that sucks the most is when you go on a trip without your parents and you get used to the freedom and relaxation and you end up having a blast. But then, when you get back home, things go back to the way they were before you left. It happens after every trip I go on, they get all pissed off within the first like 40 minutes of my return. So whatever fun I had ends in disaster thanks to parents.

Anyway,  I'm going to get going. I'll write more later.

I drove from Westfield to Cleveland in about 8 hours and thirty minutes. I was way ahead of schedule. 

When I got here Christina was babysitting so I went to the Rock and Roll hall of fame all by myself. Yeah I was bored.

I walked around the waterfront for a while and just thought ""wow...it's so quiet here"" lol. It was nice to be far away from Westfield and the shit that comes with it...what a gay little town.

After seeing all the cool things that the Waterfront had to offer I was off to lake wood to see Christina.

The rest of the night was a lot of fun, her cousin, me and two guys that her cousin knew drove around lakewood and chilled. Christina and I went to edgewood park and did some spontanious running and stuff...random but fun. 

So yeah, that was my night in lakewood. Today is Cleveland and the flatts. Cool.

"event","FIrst of all, it's none of your business what goes on in my personal life... It really had nothing to do with you or L.D. It had a lot to do with things that you couldn't POSSIBLY imagine. So don't go thinking that it had anything to you.

Second, death is not a joke and you of all people should know that. Now I don't know what is going on in your life with your father, but wasn't or isn't he close to dying? Now how would you like it if when he died I laughed my ass of and said ""wow that's funny that Lyndsay lost someone close to her that's great"". You wanna talk about hypocrite?

All you keep saying is ""grow some balls"". Well I hate to tell you this but I have balls I just don't want to waist them on a stupid issue like this. All you keep doing is going on and on writing things! Like I'm afraid of what you write! Oooo I'm so offended by all of the stuff you say...oh no..some little slut doesn't like me. Heaven forbid! Yeah right...lol I never liked you in the first place. You're just a little mooch who doesn't have a way to get around town. You use people for things that you don't have, and your temper is something that resembles a kindergartner who needs attention.

And heaven forbid you don't get something to go your way! You say that it's all about me and I walk around with my nose up in the air? Well who is the one that thinks she's some kind of dictator running around making all sorts of plans and telling people what to do and how to do it. If something doesn't go the way you want it, you get all pissed and make sure that nobody else is happy.

You think you're all mature and shit, but do mature people make fun of peoples situations and joke about death? Do mature people write things to change the opinion of people? I think we both know the answer to that would be no. 

So I think that is everything I have to say to you for now. I'm sure you'll post some stupid shit on your live journal and I'll have to do this all over again, but what the hell is the point? All you want to do is scare me and try to egg me on! It's not working! I have said it before, and I will say it again. I'm not worried about your opinion of me. You're just some stupid little slut who can't get her way when she wants it! You think your mature, but look at your actions and what you're doing? If you're trying to break Erin and I up it's not going to happen. She could care less about what you think and so can I.

I never said I was mature, and I never admitted to being all that. But by the sounds of it, that's what you think you are, when in fact you're the one blowing this way out of proportion. Grow up a bit and just deal with it. It's never going to happen the way you want it too, at least not in this situation."

"event","Tonight I went to the pops to support my Girlfriend. I didn't go to cause trouble or to start anything with anyone. It was suppose to be a night where I could just be there for her and chill with her family and not have to worry about anything.

About an hour into it Erin and I go for a walk into the hallway. There Sam and L.K. tell me that someone would like to talk to me and to wait there. I found out who it was and I decided that this wasn't the right time or place to talk about what she wanted to talk about.

So I went back to the gym and sat back down at the table. Five minutes later Erin informs me that L.K. wants to talk about things. I tell Erin to tell L.K. that this is not the right time or place to discuss this since I didn't want any trouble and since Mrs. J. Wanted me to sit with Erin's Grampy and her dad.

Erin comes back five minutes later and tells me that L.K. Hates me....

So then L.D. starts coming over in my direction but Erin needs me to go with her and find her dad to ask him something. So L.D. starts following me with B.B. and J.C. beside her as if she wanted to start something and stays close by until finally she needed to take her seat.

Unfortunately I wasn't going to talk to her at the Pops because like I said it wasn't the right time or circumstances. Nor did I want to start anything and to be honest, I thought it was dropped.

So since I didn't say anything this is what I have to say to those two ladies, and hopefully the know who they are and they have read it.

<u><b>L.D.</u></b> I honestly don't understand how you can be mad at me and yet so thankful and nice to Erin when we were both telling you the exact same thing? She was right beside me and if anything she was saying more then I was, I was just typing for her. So why is it that she get's all these praises and yet at the same time,  you get pissed at me? I was only telling you something that both Erin and I thought would be beneficial to you from what we had both heard. It wasn't a lie or anything of the sorts, it was stuff we had heard and it was meant to help you, not get you upset or to attack  anyone in particular. 

I understand if you wanted to talk to me about it, but honestly, I don't think it's best that you get other people involved. Tonight when I saw you wanted to talk to me you had J.C. And B.B. With you, and honestly it just looked like you wanted to give me shit rather then sort things out.  I'm all for sorting things out, especially if I'm just as equally confused but when it comes to the point where other people are getting involved then maybe it's best if the topic gets dropped.

In any case, you have my screen name, if you have any questions you can IM me, but in all honesty I thought the subject was dropped. 

 I'm sorry if I offended you or anybody else for that matter, but remember it wasn't JUST me who was saying stuff...Erin was to and some how you thanked her and I ended up getting shit for it!? I'm sorry if we were both looking out for you.

<u><b>L.K.- </b></u> If you can't understand that the pops wasn't the best time to talk about things then maybe it's better off that we just don't talk. You want to hate me, that's cool, I'm sorry you don't know when the best time to talk about things are. I would have talked to you about it any other time, but not at the pops when there are so many people around, including Erin's parents. You have my sn, and you know where to find me. If you're still up for sorting this out further then it already has been, I'm all ears.

I guess that's all I have to say to the both of you. L.D. I hope that answers any questions you have. L.K. I dunno what more you want. I thought things were dropped.

So goodnight, cause that's all I've got.

"event","So it's been a while since I've ""written"" in this journal but I have something to say to the people that read it.

I think I have started a war unintentionally. I thought I did something right by telling someone something I felt she had to know but then after I did it I realized that I should have confronted the person in question before I said anything to anyone. 

It also wasn't my position to say anything in the first place since it wasn't any of my  business. I think the reason I did it though was because I know what it's like to be hurt without knowing why I was being hurt so I thought if I answered some unanswered questions it might clear up something. I guess It was stupid and if I could go back and do it again, who knows, but I would have at leas confronted the person before I said something to anybody.

So I apologize to both parties, Linzie and Lyndsay for getting involved. I guess I just wanted everyone to be happy or something like that.

It wasn't an act to make anyone look bad or to make myself or Erin look good.

So if everyone can forgive me, I'd like to forget I said anything and move on so that we can all go back to living our lives. 

So I'm going to go for now. If you wanna keep updated, I keep my Dead Journal better updated so read that.

Later!

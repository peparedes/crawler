Don't feel sorry for me. I'm only writing to make myself sound better. Sound cooler. Like I actually matter.


I miss this."

"event","Relationships are harder than they are worth. It's a constant give and take of actions that ultimately end up with walls erected in their absence. You give a piece of yourself with every person you let in. It isn't fair that you can give so much for one person and feel so abandoned. They say everything is a lesson. Everything has an ultimate reason. Our actions are just an endless list of exprience. It doesn't matter."

"event","A couple weeks ago there was an episode of the office. And Pam's parents split up and Jim tells her dad how much he loves her. How he feels when he enters a room. And how he never doubted how that she was the one.

I think I'm in that same mentality. I really think I found the one. I'm not talking marriage, or at least not right now, but just that after him it's all going to be different. I mean every one changes from the people they let into their life, but it's different. My stomach does butterflies when I hear his car come into the driveway, I smile whenever I see him. Even when I get angry over something I let it go because I don't want us to fight. I'm willing to take the good with the bad. I'm willing to deal with all the little things I don't like. I've learned how to work around it. 

I have always had a crush on him. Even when I was dating someone else. I always thought he was so cute and whenever we talked I was so happy after.I know we both are so young, but I don't care. It's only been nine months and I may be a fool for thinking this but I can't help it. I would take three seasons of will they won't they if it means I'll get some sort of happy ending. 

I just wish I would be reassured I was the one for him. Answered to why he loves me. I need to know something."

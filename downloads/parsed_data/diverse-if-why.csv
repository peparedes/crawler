my <a href=""http://www.thepilotssister.blogspot.com"">blogger</a> site is going swimmingly.
does anybody read that shit?
i reread it the other day, and i realized what a fucking load of drama it is.  
i'm thinking of abandoning it. 
but i like it at the same time. 
my projects are like children.

speaking of projects, i have a new one started on livejournal
it's a fiction/nonfiction narrative diary style love-life synonpsis.
i realized earlier today that i have the most dramatic and unusal love-life.
it makes me smile a lot, and i figured that if i changed some names and details 
i should be able to make a really fun journal, off-beat and hopefully witty.

"event","Good morning world!  <br /><br />Normally, I wouldn't be doing this, but I felt it was necessary. Every once in awhile, you've got a dream so vivid and clear, that it has to be set into words.  Too bad I'm a terrible writer.  I do, however, have this thing where every few months, I read all of my old blogs and livejournal entries, and this is one I'd REALLY like to remember.  Besides, I think that it would be amusing to anyone anyway.  Let's hope I don't mess this up. :)<br /><br />[A little bit of background]<br /><br />Back in 2006 (right around this time of year) I began seeing my parents next door neighbor, Eric.  I call it seeing, I don't know if that's for-real how it was.  I liked him way more than I should have, and thus I became a ball of mushy, retarded girlbrains (which I hear are excellent when deep fried :)).  <br /><br />One night during the winter of that year, I was browsing myspace (like I had done ten million times before; I never, ever messaged anyone. . .except to tell them they were ass-hats), and I come across his profile.  I send him a message saying something about how I'm 99.99% sure he lives next door to me, and we began to speak via myspace messages.  Lame, but whatever, he was so cute (<a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v287/henryjames/sexiestnextdoorneighborever.jpg"">photographic evidence</a>. . . what's up, stalker :)).  I guess I thought he was just right for me because he was such a sarcastic dick-wad, he was tall (sup 6'2""), looked Jewish (which at one point, was a dating prerequisite with me), and he just plain was awesome (even if he liked Taking Back Sunday).  <br /><br />I probably never would have started any IRL shit with him if it weren't for my best friend, Callie.  Who oh-so boldly decided it would be a good idea to shake things up and go next door, and ""introduce"" us.  Fuck.  That night and several nights a week for the next few months, he and I would either talk on AIM (ms 8263772 faye, hit me up, I'm always bored) or via text messaging, and he would happen to ""forget"" to lock his front door, or just plain leave it open.  I'd come over and spend the night, and there would be makeout parties abound!  <br /><br />All of this ended in fall of 2006, shortly after I moved to school.  I would spend the night, at least three times a week (more like once a week when I started school).  He and I had officially gone on two dates, and things were working nicely, but he decided he'd rather be with someone else.  He moved to New York shortly thereafter, and I really hope he's doing well.<br /><br />If anyone knows Mr. Ericpants Park's whereabouts, send him a ""what's up?"" and a ""don't die"" from VanessaFaye<br /><br />Oh Ericpants, why did I have a dream about you last night?  What THE hell?<br /><br />[End background information]<br /><br />This dream was PRETTY strange. . .and. . . begin!<br /><br />I guess I'm walking through this hallway, everything is white and serene, and the people that are around me are mostly ghosts.  I'm having a conversation with an older man, his beard is long and white.   It's not flowing, nor is it well-kempt.  He's thin, and he's cheeks looked punched in.  He's got on gray robes that match his eyes and are way too pale to be normal.  He's telling me that I can pick one ghost's soul to be mine, and bring back to life and to be mine.  But only one.<br /><br />I told him, gravely, that I understood.  The old man began to close off the hallway we were walking through.  He even had vent-covers.  As the gray old man was snapping the last cover into place, I whispered his name, I whispered for Eric.  The last syllable hadn't quite crossed my lips when a young man, ashen and gray stood before me,  and I couldn't believe my eyes.  I ran to him, and he kissed me hard.  I couldn't believe this was the ghost of the man I had loved.  As our lips met, he became warm, and the gray covering him melted away.  His hair and eyes went from dusty charcoal, to warm chocolate as his skin tanned from head to foot. I can only imagine the tattoo on his shoulder melting from ash to scarlet.<br /><br />Next thing that is happens, I ask him if he wants to find the band (because in crazy mindfuck dreamland, Eric was a famous kid).  He says he'd rather not because they'd probably found a replacement for him.  It took a lot of convincing, but I finally told him that they'd slipped into dormancy after his disappearance.  He agrees and we head out into the city.<br /><br />Its a large city to which I've never been.  There were, at one point, sky scrapers everywhere, but they had fallen into decay after the apocalypse (wtf dream).  There's snow everywhere, and ruins too, so it makes it kind of crazy to navigate.  We manage.  We find a ruin, namely a crazy trolly covered in salt.  Which I explain is the rarest spice known to man.  Eric is taken aback and confused, you can see it in his eyes. . . .AND. . . . <font>wake up!</font><br /><br />That's that, wtf weird dream!"

I guess I've decided to being journaling again, because I've had a lot to figure out.  I figure maybe writing things out will give me a sense of clarity and understanding as to why my life is the way it is.  Right now, I'm very exhausted.  I haven't slept since Saturday night and it's not entirely because of the amount of homework and stuff that I've got (that's a large part of it, though).  I have no roommates in my house anymore, and it freaks me out pretty bad to be alone at night in a big, empty house.  When I say empty I mean, no furniture on top of the lack of roommates.  Just me, the dog, and the cat.  I guess having the dog is a good thing though, I let him bark all night long just so people know he's there.  I don't live in a good neighborhood at all.  It doesn't look bad, and nothing's happened in about a year, but still (our house almost got broken into about a year ago).<p>
There's a lot on my mind and it includes everything from school, to love, to at home.  I think that everyone knows that I suffer through severe bouts of depression, which is never fun.  But I can't just go on saying that I'm sad, and that's the reason why everything sucks at home.  I can't go on saying I'm sad and overworked and that's the reason my grades are bad.  I can't say I'm sad and that's why I can't pay my rent or buy food.  I have to begin to face facts, I'm just not sure what they are yet.  I'm slowly beginning to realize a pattern in certain aspects of my life, and I'd like to figure out why things are the way they are in that respect.<P>
I guess this entry is going to preface everything that I'm going to be saying the coming weeks, if you want to, feel free to read.  I'm not entirely sure whether or not I'm going to make my entries flowery and poetic, matter-of-fact,  or what, I just know that I need to write to get things out of my mind and onto ""paper.""  Maybe I could do things in a narrative third person style, make it sound like fiction, give it a twist; hidden meanings, subplots, and murder mystery!  Seems like this might be something I can play with when I' m not at work, even though this doesn't even count as a job anymore.<P>
Anyway, be prepared for a long, drawn-out battle that you wont care to read.  Be prepared to patronize me and keep in mind that every ""problem"" I have can be solved with one simple excuse, ""She's sad so...."""

"event","<small>At any rate, I had all these wonderful and dreamy things to say last night, they were really really great, really.  but of course, i was using my phone because i don't have internet at the house (unless i'm on the patio stealing it from the neighbors).  and see, i have really fat fingers which doesn't make it easy to type on a phone and i deleted my entry.  it kind of sucks, because it was really insightful, i think.  i was talking about dreams, and moving, and things i'm scared of, it was really nice.  damn my fat fucking fingers!<P>anyway, i just recently got back from my first REAL vacation in over six years, and it was really nice.  i went out to california, to visit my friends, ian and paige, with whom i went to high school.  it was a really nice time.  i have to say, it was probably the first time i was happy in two years.  that's kind of ridiculous to say, but man, i've had a rough couple of years in the good ole' scp.  i wish that i could elaborate, but i am a paranoid, paranoid person and i wouldn't want anything like my misery come back and bite me in the ass.  it has once, after all.<P>i really fucking love happy music, scarygoround.com, and kittens."

"event","<small>Hey world, whats up?  

It's really cold in my house, easily about 55 degrees inside.  I'm wearing, like, a bazillion layers of clothes!  I am so pathetically Floridian that it's completely awesome.  It's the first REAL cold day of the season, and its actually supposed to be getting down below zero tonight.  I find it vaguely amusing that the buses and flowers at Miromar (the outlet mall I used to work at) are all covered up.  God forbid we may/may not get FROST!  

My boss called me earlier today, and gave me the night off.  This is good because I really wasn't looking forward to working, I mainly just want to fix my computer and whatnot.  I'm waiting for my external hard drive to defrag, and I have nothing better to do than to sit infront of livejournal for the first time in awhile.  Rad.

The kitten was out for most of the day today.  It worried me, but the dog rescued her, so it's all good.  Alli and I actually tromped through the woods by our neighbors house looking for her.  I get so scared when she gets out.  From what I've heard, though, is that there are no bobcats or anything like that in my neighborhood.  But still....

James is passed out in bed, I really want to lie with him, but he just like to push me off and tell me to leave him alone when I get into bed with him, so yeah.



I GOT A FUCKING DRUMSET FOR CHRISTMAS (watch out San Carlos Park!)"

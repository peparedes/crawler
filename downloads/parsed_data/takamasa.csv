"event","I don't know why I'm so depressed all the time. Some of my friends are really overly nice to me. Michi sends me crap all the time, and let me use her phone card once. Nick sends me crap all the time (..ok, he buys me crap...it's <b>supposed</b> to be sent soon) and phones me occasionally when I let him. Miko-chan sent me a deadman CD (this within itself is greatness). Aki-sama writes to me (well, used to) and sent me a Blast CD, also greatness within itself. Miyuki-sama tells me she loves me practically every time I talk to her (more about her later, if I remember). Tsuyoshi is going to send me CDs <b>from Japan</b>.

Ok, so I'm basing this almost solely on materialistic things. I don't care. There's other crap too.

Anyway, these are nice things! These are great friends! They spoil me rotten, and what do I do? I whine and be depressed and cut. Shame on me. I don't deserve these people.

I'm thinking of moving over here for a little while. Rid people of my depression/annoying posts. At least that would be the idea. The chances of that actually happening are slim to nil, because I miss getting comments in my e-mail. Stupid me, getting so attached to them. I could just kick myself. That's the plan though, stay over here. Someone's gonna find this thing though, I can tell. Aya-sama found it a while back, Aki-sama found it a while back. Graaar. I almost don't want to post. Almost.

While opening up my e-mail today, I realized most of my Japanese pen pals are male. Why is that? I have some female ones, but they usually take longer to write back (except adachi, who's usually pretty fast). Strange. I seem to hang around males more in some situations, and females in others. Hm. Who knows. I forget where I was going with this.

I should be doing homework right now, but I really don't feel like talking to it. Plus Miyuki-sama just came online, and now I'm really inclined to just sit here for a while. This computer is going to be my downfall. See, if the plan works, I'll be spending less time on the computer, which means more time to work on homework. At least, that would be the logical thing. What will really happen is I'll just start watching more TV. Or playing more video games. Man, I'm a hopeless case here.

My dad doesn't like KISUI Project! Gasp! But I Have A Good Head is a good song! Same with Limite. Kisui needs to give me more music here.

We watched Bowling For Columbine last night. About half an hour into it, I wanted to stop watching, but as it went on, it got a lot better. I always think documentary type things are gonna suck, and then they don't. I'd ramble about it, but I already did that in my other journal.

Don't feel much like rambling about Miyuki-sama right now. I love her though."

"event","Eee, long time no update for my beloved Takamasa journal. Bad me. I suck at keeping private journals. I always say I will (keep a private journal that is), but I never keep it well. Hopefully I'll get better.

At any rate, to get to the point. I hate going places with my friends. It's always exciting at first, but then we get there...and I just don't feel right. I don't feel like I belong there, which is true most of the time - I don't. I don't belong around anyone. I don't fit in. I just...don't.

That fact is starting to set in though. I said usually it's exciting to go places at first, but this time I was really actually dreading it. Well, I guess it was partially to blame on the situation...I don't like going out for supper, and I really don't like going to Japanese places with my friends because they're all uber Japanese obsessed people. Makes me feel inadequate or something. That's beside the point though. Not only was I not looking forward to eating out, I was not looking forward to spending time with Brandi, Alli and Christi, because I knew I would sit there, off to the side, and mope. That's what I do. I hate it. I hate myself for being like that.

I would love nothing more than to cut right now. What the hell, why not. It's not like anyone could stop me.

When I was walking home from Brandi's house, I realized that I am going to be a loner for the rest of my life. There's no avoiding it.

And! Gah, Brandi's house. We (that being Brandi, Alli and me) get there, and they both turn to me and go ""bye!"" and head inside. Excuse me? People always think that I'm anti-social and I don't spend a lot of time around people, but the truth is, people never give me the chance. There was that, there was Crystal saying ""too bad you can't come bowling""... I never actually said I couldn't go bowling. She just assumed. Brandi and Alli assumed I didn't want to do anything. Everyone always assumes.

People think they know me so well. Hah.

Now, to put up a happy exterior, because I'm starting to feel so guilty about being depressed all the time."

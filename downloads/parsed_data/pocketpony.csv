"event","....i just got kicked out of the shower a bit ago...cause my mom had a client and she didnt want me in the nice washroom incase anyone had to use it...so not only did she wake me up at 7:45 to kick me out of my room because her clients were coming, she kicks me out of the shower too..so now that im finnaally clean...she says..erin can you make some sandwiches for dad cause this CLIIIEEENNNT is running a little late and i wont have time...


and she wants me to come home tonight after work...to be woken up tomorrow morning at 7 something..again


yesterday me and my dad went on adventures..he bought a new walkie talkie phone..(walkie talkie is the best set of words ever thought up) then we went to the flea market...to get a box for the satelite dish..that place was sketchy to say the least..the people there were very precise about their choice of wording. and we saw some of the jamaicans that come here to work with my dad..it was odd..i think they were buying weed...i dont think my dad noticed..or maybe he pretended not to, like me...then we left..and on our way out saw one of the new mustangs. it was blue. and i had a crush on it. and me and my dad thought it was wierd to see it in such a sketchy neighbourhood. then thought a little more and then thought it not so sketchy.

then we went to super pet and bought some fish. green tiger barbs..they look moldy...i hope they didnt get eaten last night...maybe i will go check
k bye"

"event","today was awsome...so nice out...the fucking wather network lied to me and it would have been a lovely day to go to the zoo...but whatever.

i took puppy for the longest walk ever instead, we counted bees sniffing dandilions and then i found the biiigest one ever..seriously it had a radious of 2 inches. peach trees are the best for the next few weeks. while home i plan on walking out into the middle of the orchard with puppy to hang out in the grass and look and the pink sky and the yellow polkadot ground...we went to the lake today for a bit...and saw some fishies swimming about and a whooole lot of ducks...so cute..i also fed some ducks bread but that was way later on the front lawn...they were waddling through the peach trees enjoying the dandilions as well today...

i drove around abit just now listning to music and returned some movies...it put me in such an amaizing mood..happy and whatnot.

then i came on here...and im talking to some people from st kitts on stupid msn...and for some reason its making me feel really crappy.i have this division with aquaintances, some being from oakville and knowing me through school, other being from work and knowing me through there...others being in bands and knowing me through shows, and others through highshool and whatnot..st. kitts and highschool and work all blend together and overlap a bit..then oakville is completely cut off. being there i can forget about past everythings and my focus is stuck on today and maybe tomorrow but outside of that it doesnt matter cause whatever happens happens...being home during the week i get sucked into this thing where i think too much about dumb things like how friends arent real or maybe i just dont have any because of how focused on one person i can get or maybe around here nothing like ""friends""exist maybe its cause everyone i know i know through people..i dont have a single friend (outside of a select few who arguably are my good friends), that i know through me. im basically known as that girl who knows so and so or whent out with that guy..which really means i know no one. and when i stop knowing so and so/going out with that guy.,..then what - noothing...maybe thats why oakville right now feels nice..i know pple through me there not through someone else..i also dont have a whole lot of close friend there...maybe im just not ""suited"" for such a position. maybe im not supposed to have friends. maybe there is no such thing as these people who i hang out with because we enjoy eachothers company therefor spend whole days doing things together enjoying every minute.  maybe memories of that actually existing were fake.

either way...i wish i could sleep right now..fast forward to tomorrow..not be sitting here eating peanuts and drinking h2o..im doing to make a wombat..k bye"

anywayyyys i was awake staring at my ceiling looking at the cheesy glow in the dark stars that are there from when i was like 12 and thinking about stuff cause thats what i do sometimes. 

anyway i was thinking about who names things.

like sheep for instince..who decided that these big dog sized fuzz balls with ears deserve the name sheep and not puffies...or fluff fluffs...or why arent they called marshmellows, and marshmellows sheep...we could be having sheep when we eat smores..actually in some ways we probly are, and in other ways sheep are in mallows...odd 


im going to see the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy in about 2 hours ish with harber...and we will get coffee..annnd by coffee i mean a chia latte..

OH  and i was watching oprah today and they were talking about health and stuff...coffee is good for you... as is red wine but i knew that before but now i know what it is kn red wine that makes it good(because they leave the skin on the grapes when they make it and white wine they take it off) but that brought me to another question...would a glass of red grapejuice be like drinking wine..health wise

erins dad says... ""no""

moving on, i pushed aside odd thoughts of abandonment from the social circles of old highschool relationships and found some toast and honey for breakfast.  it was tastey..i made dog food for puppy early so i could take her for a run in the morning...but she never ate it..sorta sad but she does that sometimes lately.. i dont think she likes the taste of her medication.  

so we went for a run..only runs with her now a days arent like they used to be cause she doenst run any more... i jog around her at a very slow pace while she hobbles along sniffing stuff i think cause it hurts to run..she has arthritus or something...we get to the lake and investigate endless opportunities of adventure and....its raining...not just raining but it starts to hail...fuck everything our adventure is hacked apart right then and there and its time to head home.. only puppy doesnt want to...shes not in a long sleeve freezing her ass off, shes under thick fur and doesnt even know what hail is.. litrally i had to pull her home....kicking and screaming....(well she would have been if she could)but i still had to pull her...it was sad...

i get home..and the breeder people had called while i was out and talked to my mom about how the litter of puppies that we were to purchase two fluffy monsters from had all been born and died within the last week...

my dad came home for lunch and went out with rodney to wendys to get burgers...i didnt get one because i was eating spaghetti and im ""too fat and need to lose the chub, the last thing you need is a burger""..i didnt even ask for one...nor did i even want one...

im ...      done.........



i swear its the oddest feeling i have ever felt...ever...aside from scratching my shoulder and feeling it on my tummy....thats more odd....

but this...what the hell..im soooo stresses out right now.i feel like there is a million things to be done and i need to not be sitting here doing nothing...cause work...and more work...then i do this for a bit alfkjaq rknqel tlqkejtlqm erlqiejrlq a dflkjr qjr lqkewmr   ... and then i have to be quiet and reallly think realllly hard about how im done school for the year...and i already finished my final two drawings for ted...and im DONE....completely..and there is nothing to be done....WHY CANT I RELAX..s;lfk jws ahhh////

moving on i came home for a very quick visit..to get clean clothes, see a doctor, eat some delicious pie, steel some food, and take the looongest hoooteeesssttt shower ever..cause in oakville i swear our shower has a 3 minute timer and as soon as it buzzes it chucks ice cubes at you...

being home is nice...there are no roomates to talk about you in the living room forgetting that the walls in the house are pretty much non existent and you can hear every word they are saying...i just wanna get out of that stupid house...and not think about it ever...EVER...

moving on again...sarah wants me to move to toronto with her....and i want to.,..but i told some pple id live with them this year...so not living with them and moving to T.O. would be lying..and wrong....that and it will be me commuting every day....dont know how well that would be...time/cost wise. 

tomorrow i am going to go buy something...i dont know what but i justgot paid and i want to buy something...other then beer,..haha....so excited...maaan what the helll this stupid feelinnng...GO AWAY@!|

so much to do this summer...maybe thats what this odd feeling thinger is all about...my friend is working in a new art gallery that just went up in niagara....with some new artists that are in town i suppose...i have to make it a point to go in lots...maybe they will sell something i make...maybe i will make them give me money for something..also painting in its self..this year has been rather depressing in the painting field becuase i feel sort of like i stepped backwards ..waaayy backwards..but today when ted was critiquing me he said something that i think, thinking about it now, made everything feel okay..something about how i have this odd style that maybe doesnt apply to painting portraits of pple so that they look real...odd cause last night at way too late i thought that myself...i cant paint something to look like a photo...im not that good i suppose...dont know if i care to be that good tho..if i want a photo i will surely just take a picture...
..there are no more thoughts in my head...i was thinking i was typing something and that went ingto how i drove to school today (matt i know it was a lovely day outside...and i swear i thought about walking)(i swear)....(all the way down to the basement and out the door again then i saw my car and thought....it would be so much faster) but then i fdorgot why i was thinking of why i was driving...know what this is dumb i dont know what im typing...
fuck its one...holy shit...its one...and i can go to sleep...cause i have no work to do...hahaha  .,...  beer tomorrow...k bye....sorry this was a pointless read...k bye"

possably going to see a real doctor today...we will see how that goes...either i have nothing or something...so hopefully its one of those two things.  ...otherwise im not too sure what that means.hmm if i can come outta this being able to eat popsicles i think i may just survive, aand i was talking to rey last night and him and my basement roomies made a pact to make erin eat good cause i suppose ive been worrying them a bit. that made me feel all fuzzy inside, i love those boys... hmmmmm

yay moms done room is once again mine, i didnt do anything but im gonna play it off like i battled her out of it cause im tuff"

"event","hmmm....so i was rediculously bored just now...read through some of last years posts and thought to my little self...maaaaan i can really hate stuff sometimes..

so im sick...on chocolate weekend...dont know if im gonna go to oakville tonight for school tomorrow. maybe i will go get xrays of my insides and some heavy medication. maybe i will get some vegetables. or as chad thinks some meat....im not sure how much i enjoy meat i dont think of my self as a vegetarian but i suppose someone who doesnt eat meat because they dont like it ...is in some way...something like a vegetarian...honestly its just kinda gross...kinda...i like yogurt tho...mmm tastey

hmm what else has made my weekend exciting...(insert thinking)...CLAYYTON called me i thiiink friday night...at like 12 and i was sleeping but i said i wasnt cause i didnt want him to feel bad. i havent talked to him in forever and never on the phone at least that i can remember so it was an alright event for friday at midnight. hi clayton hi hi...i hope i made sense cause sometimes when im not really away nothing i say makes sense...hmm... odd to think of.

odd and some nice conversations over the msn the last couple of day ..makes me smile to think of  nicenes i slept all weekend..no chocolate actually..i got a cadbury creme egg. but i didnt eat it...hmm..havent eaten in 3 days...maybe all i need is a juice box...

this is getting long and full of nothing 
i suppose thats what happens when i write nothing in forever..maybe i will right more in the future boring days to come.."

roomates are tools....
i dont get along with the girls in the house.. they are all kinda bitchy/ditsy/yea lets all paint our nails with little flowers and do eachothers hair kinda pple.  i have nothing wrong with that really but i dont see myself going out of my way to start a conversation with any of them in perticular.

i get along with the guys so far i suppose.  stephan lives in my part of the house and he made me spaghetti one night..hes the only one out of my house that will talk to me. 

then there is rey and chad and this other guy patrick in the basement. chad gets annoying. i can only handle so much of him. 
that was mean im sure i get annoying too.  i just don really annoy myself too much so i guess i dont notice it as much.

in whole oakville sort of sucks. or at least what i know of it sucks.


on a different note being back home for work is alright. drank a bit last night with jo at nathans house. tonight i dont know whats up.. spencer is having a new house party if nothing in niagara turns up cause i know jo may not be up for a party in niagara.  due to events of last night .. . there is also florida evens' show in toronto tonight as well.. i dont know if i should drive all that way then come back here for work tomorrow then back out there tomorrow night.

"event","...  got home from work..  and going to kennys later wth jo to say bye to kyle..  

had a sorta odd night last night. ..  and a lovely chat with harber. a dear friend who i have missed greatly the past month or so. so glad i know he doesnt hate me at all. 
 wierd how i can miss people soo much, be sorta jelouse about things they do.. and how i can be so mad/pissed off at them all at the same time.  maybe not mad at all, that may have been a bad choice of letters,..just disapointed and the occurance of events that pple go though and somehow change around. or that pple change at all.   or maybe its the feeling like i never really knew anyone and their not really changing at all it just feels like it.  

human beings should learn to just be completely honest and 100% themselves at all times.  life would be much less confusing, or decieving and less dissapointing at times.  whatever.. a few pple that i thought i knew really well have been way too dissapointing in the last little while. its made me sort of upset and upset with myself because i feel like it is somehow my fault, or in some way i have let them down or done something/not done something that in turn has made them react in a way that dissapoints me.  therefore me being upset is my own fault.  makeing me hate myself

also the fact that i am upset at all makes me more mad at myself. i really have nothing to be angry at i have food i have water, clothing shelter etc.  my life is fucking greaaat.  im not dying of ebola in some foreign country. i know what cheeseburgers are, and i have all my limbs, and senses.  what the fuck would i have to complain about. yet somehow, i can still be sad or upset about stupid things.   that just makes me waay too angry at me.... 

mark was way to drunk, as was dylan last night.  making the night more odd then it already was.  casey was as well really wasted.  and steve..  hahha  so funny. but bbq at jordan and chantels house was deliciouse. and they have the sweetest dogs ever i want to have my own dog for oakvill to keep me company.  but no pets allowed..  fuck all.  no its not really bad i really am in no possition to take care of any other life form aside from myself right now.

not too excited to move into a big house with lots of pple..  maybe it is all for the best and will force me out of this pathetic shy pocket i have somehow got myself stuck into all over again.... we will see."

"event","..   i worked today.

i still think that my store should seriously make an investment in a pet cat. cause i think pple would enjoy coming into the store and seeing a cute little kittie.  

and if not i would so there.

my brother is yelling at me now to clean up some skateboard stuff that just haaapens to be mine and lying in the middle of the kitchen floor.   what an ass.

"event","i went to see alexis play last night..   it was somewhat lovely..  

im pretty sure sarahs friends hate me..  tons for whatever reasons..   im pretty sure i dont care tho it just is odd when you sitting with pple and they talk to each other about you...  as if you are not sitting right there or cant hear them, or something like that..  



however old men with posters are way too creepy....  

and im pretty sure i was on e..  i suppose i would have to talk to joanne about that one..  

all and all..  right now im in a ""pretty alright""  mood i suppose   i have nothing but ikea adventures too look forward to for today..  parhaps a keg party this evening..  we will see how things fall apart"

"event","all that i have to say...  is being with pple   that dont really know you exist..    makes one feel very shitty about ones self..   

then they question why you dont talk   yet tell you that everything you ever say is pointless and ""unintelligent""..  really then doesnt that make them the dumb shit for wondering why you dont speak up more often???

or tell you that you should stop worrying about what other pple think about you and learn to say no and not feel like everyone elses happiness is your responsability.  yet they add to the pile of things you have to worry about like it is nothing at all.  or get pissed off the ONE time you are thinking of yourself and not them becasue they aaalllways think of you and never about themselves/... (note sarcasm please)

or tell you that the reason you are unhappy is because you have no friend..   yet the reason you have no friends is because you never go out with anyone because pple get pissed off that you are not around.  or they want you to never leave their side when you are out somewhere and talking to pple other then them would be waaaay to rude.   yet these rules cant apply to them because that would make them the ones with no friends and thats not fun for them..  


what the fuck..  i should have just highlighted *fuck* 8.7 zillion times... then highlighted that, coppied and pasted..  then everyone maay pooosibly have an idea of how i feel right now...

"event","i just made brownies...   but i accidentally put 3/4 cups of coco in instead of half a cup...    cause i dont make things usually...    and there was no brownie mix..    so its not my fault my mom should have been assisting..    half an hour and i can mow down..   

i have 4 less teeth now to chomp with...  haha and it didnt hurt at all...  which is kinda odd..   my dad said it hurt. 

i never even got puffy or brused..   maybe they didnt take any of my teeth and just said they did ..  those bastards

either way i get to eat all the chocolate pudding and mashed potatoes i want..   so everything is lovely.."

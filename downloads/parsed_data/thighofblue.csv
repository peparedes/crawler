"event","Since it's valentine's day... and I'm all by my lonesome (as usual) i thought i'd waste my time and whoever reads this' time by posting on el jay.. blah!

gotta say... v-day cuts in a bit deeper now after having two roommates with insanely romantical boyfriends....which is adorable and sweet and i'm so happy/jealous that they've found their other halves.. but jeesus.... i don't want to hear about it.... -stabs self repeatedly-

the boys i have contact with are increasingly retarded.... it must be a daap thing.. i dunno.. but i've discovered i never want to date in my major and i want to date someone older then me... only because i know they will be mentally mature enough to be around.... i know there are exceptions but seriously... it's like being around 5 year old monkeys O_O

this also seems magnified by the fact that i'm the only other single girl in my class that isn't a complete whore.. therefore COMPLETELY ON THE MARKET..and apparently touchable.... O_O i'm serious... there are 6 girls in my class... two are dating happily (my roommates), one is married, one is a lesbian, and the other is sophisticated/unattainable/obnoxious....then there's me.... 

i'm sorry.. but i thought it was common knowledge that people have personal bubbles in which they do not like to be prodded, poked, petted, etc etc.... apparently i'm the pillsbury dough boy to the guys.. they like poking me, petting my hair, scaring me, having insanely close conversations a;ldksfja;lsdkfjad;lkfj 

it's all very flattering if it wasn't so fifth grade... ugh.. i will literally kick the next guy in the balls... whatever happened to maturely wooing the girl...instead of like...feeling her up in order to gauge interest...ugh...

so not interested... stop thinking you're ladies men... because you aren't... and you make me throw up in my mouth a little...

in other news i can't wait to get the hell out of daap and into a major i'm completely interested in and hopefully a different set of guys.... because the ones i know at the moment make me want to die... repeatedly...

all i want is a nice, somewhat older guy, preferably in another major so we have other things to talk about, who respects my personal space until i'm ready, that showers on a regular basis, isn't into the whole growing-weird-facial-hair-just-because-i'm-in-college-now thing, is funny without needing to be the complete center of attention, sweet, goes into the sunlight, doesn't hate animals, and makes the first move in a non-fifth-grader-way because i'm shy and old-fashioned... it's a lot.. but that's all i'm asking for..

doesn't seem like he exists yet though...sigh

in other other news i am torn.... do i want to be a filmmaker or a concept artist? do i want calarts or do i want art center? in my heart i want calarts so badly.... i think if i don't get in i will be beyond devastated...like.. the point of not eating...purposefully sleeping a lot/coma...hating my life devastated....god what will i do if it's a rejection letter? besides jumping off a cliff .. it means i'm stuck in daap for the rest of my college life....and no one wants that....i can't be an industrial designer... i hate it with every fiber of my being.. it's a complete chore in the mornings just to wake up with the knowledge that i have class that day... FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON THE THING I HATE MOST IN LIFE... the only time i bounce out of bed with a skip in my step is for figure drawing... where i can actually breath.. and be myself.. and completely excel!!!!! it's wonderful and i love it so much and my teacher is so awesome and pushing the way i visually approach a figure... 

ugh... daap would be a little easier to stomach i think.... if the teachers were actually legit.. but they aren't... i'm not usually a cocky bastard about my art... but if i can outdraw my professors... then i have no respect for them.. if they have nothing to teach me that i haven't already taught myself in my free time they're not worth my time.... and the fact that the beginning of every class starts with the professor saying ""if you don't live and breath sustainability and design and blah doobey doo blah then you shouldn't be here"" and I'm like ""uh huh... i'm in complete agreement.. i shouldn't be here""

if it weren't for my parents i would've backhanded my design communications teacher with my laptop and marched right out of class already... if not for the fact he's a horrible teacher it's the fact that he has no respect for people at all... the shit he said alone about suicide makes me want to get his ass fired.. but he's on tenure... FUCK TENURE.. if a teacher has reached that point in their lives they shouldn't be teaching... i don't care how hot shit you were in the 80s... it's a different time period old man... people use goddamn photoshop and illustrator now to kick your gauche ass...

a;dlsfja;dlkfjad; makes me so angry.... 

sigh... man i just get on el jay and it's like.. woooooosh everything i've had bottled up comes railing out..... it's very therapeutic... there.. now you know what bothers my on a daily basis.. grabby boys, fuckwit professors, and acceptance woes....

don't even get me started on co-op... or lack there of.... i keep having nightmares about ending up in mcdonalds flipping burger patties.... 

Dear Economy,
GO FUCK YOURSELF.
no love,
Erin

seriously... i'm not going to get a job.... there are no jobs.. people get calls in the morning like ""yay welcome to the company you have an internship"" then four hours later they get called back ""jk jk jk we have no monies sucks to be you kbye""

especially considering my list is this for co-ops:

Disney 
Pixar
Nickelodeon
Dreamworks
Bluesky
DC
Marvel
Disney Imagineering
Mattel


and the fact that my co-op advisors only reply to my MILLIONS OF FREAKOUT EMAILS was ""contacted mattel, will hear more later""

also hahahaha to every single animation studio/comic job because they are complete dreams that will never happen.. i have a better chance of being disney's assistant to the assistant of the assistant janitor omg .... but my co-op advisor had to butter me up with having all these wonderful contacts at these places...... :( but these places want animation students not character drabbling hates-their-major id students.....

FUCK... i should have been more realistic... especially when my only reasonable co-op venture is mattel... and they're completely tanking in the economy... :(

i am going to be a hobo...




meh


hahaha.... i like how i start with happy valentine's day and end with OMGWTFBBQ job panic...such is life"

"event","merry christmas!!!

man.... i took in a lot of awesome swag this year... which was unexpected..as my parents and i had set goals with money..but they got me the bestest things ever!!!! 

i got the art of kung fu panda (which is beautiful omg) and the art of Bolt (which i can't look at yet because i have yet to see the movie...so i don't want to spoil myself) and then of course wall-e, dark knight and iron man dvds... and an EVE DOLL!!! because my cousin is awesome...

you'd think a nine year old boy was just made very very happy today by the stuff i raked in.. sheesh i need to grow up.... 

but after spending today looking through arts/watching movies....i'm torn between being really really inspired to wanting to just jump off a cliff with feeling talentless...

this combination is only furthered by these people i keep finding online who are my age or younger who are way too awesome .... i need to get my ass out of daap and into a better school.... a;ldkfa;dkfj i'm only going so far on my own... i want teachers and classes and classmates that are relevant to my interests.. none of this goddamn industrial design stuff... plbbbtttttt i want character design.. good GOD i NEED set design classes... backgrounds, perspective, figure drawings, landscapes... uh huh huh huh... not fair...

and i look at stuff like this http://www.blithegirl.deviantart.com/ where this girl is obviously at some animation school in california....and my age .....makes me feel like some talentless hack....

March 1st through April 1st needs to come right now.... just end my misery and let me know i didn't get in already... criminy i'm dying with the wait... in the meantime i'm applying for this: http://corporate.disney.go.com/careers/walt_disney_animation_studios_intern_info.html

HA! like that'll happen... :/



wow.. when i rant.. i rant... i'm too negative/worried for my own good... meef.. whatever happens..happens... i know i'm going to go somewhere...i just want it to happen sooner...."

in other news.... Matt Rhodes who did the character design for Mass Effect is my new inspiration.... i don't even play video games...but this guys vision and style is sick
http://www.rhodesbros.net/mattart.html
http://www.creativeuncut.com/art_mass-effect_a.html


i wonder if i can get a co-op at bioware....problem is they want the gamers....and i am not a gamer... i just want to draw for them...like woah


co-ops to try for but probably will never get a payed internship with in order to qualify...let alone even be considered for (because i'm so positive about these things):
Disney
Mass Effect
Bioware
Marvel
DC
Blue Sky
Nickelodeon
basically....ANYTHING CHARACTER DESIGN!!!!! 

oh hay...calarts... stop being so expensive...where's that insanely rich yet obscure relative whom i've never met but loves me dearly and has left their frillions of dollars as well as their awesome estate all in my name!?!??!? damnit...i was born into the wrong family...... in other news...now would be a great time for angelina jolie and brad pitt to get their adopting butts in gear and find me....even though i am now 20 and not from a completely desolate country...i also don't have a name with the letter x in it.....but...i'm in ohio!!! that's got to count for something... :/

"event","mmmmmm hullo..... wanted to waste time... so here:



meme thing gangked from bri-chan 

01] What is your pen name?
Burnbadart

02] How did you get the name?
I needed a new aim name to replace mccartneyobass. My parents have a poster hanging up on the stairwell that had the words burn your bad art...and so it was born.

03] Do you use PC or Mac?
both i guess. because i use bootcamp on my mac in order to do 3D modeling stuff on alias and solidworks for school... but i prefer Mac over PC anyday!!!

04] What software do you use most often?
PHOTOSHOP CS2!!! and CS3...but only at work because i can't afford to upgrade on my laptop. :/

05] Do you use mouse, or tablet?
My tablet.... oh dear gawd...i couldn't do anything with a mouse.

06] The color you use most often is?
browns, black, indigo and grays...so..all the boring colors.... they're my go tos for sketching, etc.  but i'll use a mix of everything depending on what the art ends up being.

07] What area of the pictures do you put most effort into?
I like to go into crazy details with the clothing and pushing the poses and expressions.  Probably most effort goes into the outfits (at the moment).

08] How long does it take you do draw a picture?
Depends... sketches can take me like a minute.. but full blown awesome beautiful finished pieces can be anywhere from a day to days/months/forever.  mostly because of freetime and also if i'm in the groove... i can bang that thing out in like 4 hours tops...thank you work for pushing my speed and skill level :)

09] Do you keep your rough drafts?
ALWAYS...in layers...or in my sketchbooks.  i love my rough sketches.  my finished pieces are always very stiff..which is something i'm trying to work on and that i'm getting better with... but i just like to be able to see my process and look back on them.

10] What kind of font do you use most often?
M something...myriad i think... which might make a graphic designer keel over dead...whatev...

11] What's the dpi when you scan?
300 dpi... even if it eats my memory...

12] Do you do anything else when you're drawing pictures?
I'm a multitasker.  I'll listen to music, watch tv, take random internet breaks, eat and drink, etc.

13] How many pictures do you draw in a month?
um...a lot....like...for serious... probably in the hundreds... this is if you're taking every freaking doodle i leave everywhere every second of the day... seriously.. i doodle at restaurants, i doodle at work when i'm supposed to be doodling other stuff, i doodle when i'm shopping markers at michael's, i doodle at home, on my friend's paper/notebooks/homework, i doodle on my own homework...on my arms... if you haven't gotten this yet.. I DRAW ALL THE TIME...and on ANY THING.

14] What kind of paper do you draw your pictures on?
is this meme about scanning drawings in mainly? because i love to draw with the wacom as well... i'll just do the undersketch and lineart straight into photoshop.  but i draw on just about whatever i get my hands on.... printer paper mostly..which is bad because my sketchbook is so full of loose leaf it's falling apart....i can't draw in sketchbooks.. it's like i freeze up when my paper is in bound form....and i have a soft spot for lined paper and newsprint... so everything bad for sketches.... napkins and post its too.... sheesh....things that would never look good no matter how you present it in your portfolio :/

15] What kind of paper do you use for sketches and drafts?
#14

16] How long does it take to ink something?
I don't really ""ink"" something.... like lineart?on pencil sketches? not really my thing... i draw with ballpoint a lot though.. and linearting in photoshop takes me a bit....if i want it to look spanking awesome... 

17] Do you do doujinshi or original manga?
no....i'm trying to keep away from anime.... 

18] Do you like doujinshi? Is it fun making it?
bleh

19] Ever submitted anything to a magazine?
i don't think so...

20] Did it get published?
meh

21] Who are your favorite artists?
Alphonse Mucha, Earl Oliver Hurst, the star wars concept artists, marvel and dc guys...

22] What's your favorite Anime/Manga?
avatar the last airbender? does that even count? ....i don't think i read this meme well... 

23] Favorite Characters?
duurr... catwoman

24] Any artists that you'd like to draw like?
everyone and anyone that's better then me.....so... a lot of people.... mainly to be able to draw and express myself like the disney/pixar folks do...

25] Do you buy books a lot?
way too many books.... i'm on a NO BOOK BUYING thing right now... because i need all the money i can save up right now... :/

26] Did you ever buy a book to inspire you to draw?
uh yah.... all the art nouveau books i can get my hands on, i got the star wars concept books from my dad, pixar movie books, earl oliver hurst poster book, top illustrator thing book, costume/fashion books, nickelodeon book.....LOTS OF BOOKS

27] Any video games you enjoy?
...i like mario kart i guess.... sims? i don't really have a gaming system... so no?

28] Any favorite characters from video games?
the ones from guitar hero....i love the artist that did that guitar hero commercial....he does the stuff for gorillaz.... i should probably know this.. bleh

29] Do you have a favorite writer?
JD Salinger hands down

30] Any books you really enjoy?
i'm a sucker for young adult... it's horrible because i'm not fourteen anymore... so now i'm trying to force myself to read tasteful literature...i'm slowly trucking through the english patient right now... after tearing through cold mountain WHICH WAS AWESOME!!....so... tasteful literature isn't so bad... i'm just a person that judges books by their covers... WHICH IS HORRIBLE... i know... but tasteful literature never has fun covers.. YA always has great illustrations... sometimes that's the only reason i buy some of those books...

31] Do you write fanfics?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

32] Any music that you often listen to while drawing?
i have a soundtrack that goes along with my infinite plot hole movie/comic/book/tvshow art thing called the immortals arc at the moment.... so all kinds of songs.. mostly Muse though and a lot of depeche mode at the moment.. weird...ummm and always always coldplay

33] Any recommended songs?
starlight, enjoy the silence, where is my mind, paper planes, viva la vida

34] Any web sites that you totally admire?
mmm...facebook? harr

35] Do you have any sites you want to go to every day?
yeah... i check eljay friends list for updates, deviantart to stalk, facebook like every hour..which is sad, yahoo and uc email....um...youtube...

36] What is your dream site like?
forget dream site... my dream is to begin to fathom how to make a site...and then i'll dream it up.... i am so computer/internet illiterate....

37] Do you like your own art?
usually....but then i see someone better...and always younger then me..and then i hate myself for the rest of the week...

46] Are you a computer expert?
at photoshop....and time wasting.. :)

47] Want to become a professional artist?
YES YES YES...more then i want to continue breathing

48] Any other jobs you're interested in, besides illustration?
not really interested in illustration... i just want to do character design

49] Any other specialties besides drawing?
i've learned i can cook, i'm good at naps, and i'm sometimes a fun person to hang out with? wow.. i am so screwed if someone chops my right hand off... i have no career options outside of art...

50] Do you like to watch movies?
very much so... hence wanting so much to be in the entertainment biz....pixar, disney, nickelodeon, lucasfilm, marvelfilm... O_O

51] What's your favorite movie?
at the moment it's between stardust and the incredibles.... but if you asked me when i was like.. 7 or 8 it was hands down, no questions, definitely the lion king

52] Have you ever entered art contests?
yep.. through school.... and that's it...

53] When did you start drawing seriously?
i've drawn since i could pick up a crayon...serious serious drawing....it depends... i didn't really consider art seriously until highschool....i was really leaning towards equine/vet or writing/english for a long long time...even though i loved to and excelled at art... hmmmm....i think because as cool as my parents were being toy designers i wanted to do something different and not art related.... so much for that..... i still don't want to be a toy designer..no matter how strong its siren call.... (DAMN YOU HASBRO) but now i will cut off my leg before being anything but art related...and really i just me character design....for reals... CUT OFF MY LEG... i'll totally do it.... 

54] Anything that you often use as a reference when you draw?
myself...and inspiration images....i'll pull from online or books around me or people around me... just to get ideas from how others draw, how something looks etc...NOT TO COPY...NEVER TO COPY

55] Have you met any of your fans online?
i don't think i have any fans online...because i'm a lameass...oh and i don't have time to post anything online because i actually have a paying job where i get to draw characters everyday until january.... hmmmm... i'll take that over 12 year old fangirls anyday... i love you hasbro....maybe too much...

56] You have a lot of pen pals?
no? i keep up with friends on facebook...but i don't think that really counts....

57] You have a lot of friends that draw?
at school yes... outside of school...also yes

58] What time do you usually go online?
all day.....it's an addiction...

59] Do you like to go to chat rooms?
no

60] Do you have your own computer?
yes..and a brand spanking new huge awesome monitor..that i can't use right now because it wouldn't fit in my car/i would never haul it out to massachusetts for fear of breaking it/having someone steal it on the way over

61] What would you say to the person you admire?

"event","just so i don't forget some stuff...because listening to muse fuels my creativity....well.. with personal projects anyways... gawd i should seriously be writing the story for reals..instead of dreamering about it...feh

sushi kids plot:
names....apt to change
Miso soup boy=Tobias
Green Tea Girl=Gemma
Fortune Cookie Boy=Jonathan ""Nate"" ""Lucky""
Sake Girl=Alice
Sushi Girl=""Charlotte"" Charlie..or mehbeh not
Kim Chi Boy= still not sure

immortals plot:
powers and names ....also apt to change
draws any weapon imaginable out of thin air=Piper (in her twenties)
- acts as almost a maternal figure to ""copycat""..although slightly unhinged... falls in love with James....maybe....feels she is unworthy of an immortal....how can she compare to all those he has loved in his hundred years? will probably have an epic not quite death at the end because i said so....

immortal #5/grant immortality or take away life with the touch of his hand=James (over a hundred years old but appears to be in his mid twenties)
-hides the fact that he is immortal by masquerading as a ""normal""..comes to the groups aid at random intervals..sort of follows in the shadows in the beginning but later in the story becomes a big part of the group... falls in love with Piper throughout the adventures...feels they can never be together because of what he is..

can copy and retain any power= still unnamed (16)
- main protagonist of the story...begins as the enemies secret weapon...gets amnesia by accidental destruction of the base he's housed at...taken under Piper's wing..and through their adventures slowly starts regaining his memory..and regains the powers he has collected so far....adventures turn into a quest to find the rest of the immortals in order to gain the knowledge needed to return the world to it's former way...basically save mankind...(as usual) ....has a moment where he reverts to ""evil""....

is a ""finder""= Evey..pronounched eh-vee (14 or 15)
-hostage turned part of the group...daughter of the ""good"" side's leader..with the power to locate any person, place, or thing... taken ""hostage"" by piper, ""copycat"", james, and robot? in order to help find the immortals as well as other key places and people....falls in love with ""copycat"" ....

either a robot or Piper's twin brother? who knows.....the group in the beginning needs to be three= still unnamed (meh) 
- yeah...i dunno yet...

immortals so far: future, past, healing, creation, power.............(together they make captain planet!! -shot)
original deaths/rebirths into immortality:
occur when the world begins to visibly decay....and by decay i mean enormous loss and horror occurs in history to the human race or to the earth itself...
#1 future - i really want her to be from the middle ages.. 
#2 past - meh?
#3 healing - was a slave
#4 creation - meh? i'm thinking this ones the leader of the enemies?
#5 power - ww1 or ww2
#6 control? - ww3 is ""copycat""

bad guys are both the so called ""enemies"" and ""good side"" both groups are corrupt ...made up of the remains of countries.....especially those that had tension.....
so like.... united states/canada/europe,etc.. would be the so called ""good side"" ....middle east/asia/russia, etc.. would be the so called ""enemies""
most countries have been destroyed to the point of no man's lands and just plain battle zones.....there are no named countries in this time period...no races... people are referred to by powers or lack there of... so:
""elites"" are those with powers in the ""military"" ..
""normals"" are the powerless.... 
""renegades"" are those with powers that choose neither side and have escaped the military they were raised to fight in....
""immortals"" are people who upon their first death continue to live in that original age and body but gain immense power...they cannot die...or..well...only the ""fifth"" immortal can take away their immortality.....immortals are brought into the world when exceptionally horrible things occur that take away from the earth in a manner that can't be reversed....? (this is a new idea so who knows...)

the people of this earth have been waiting for a sort of ""prophecied"" person to save them..... insert ""copycat"" here


hmmmrrmmmmeh yeah.... i need to draw these guys out more.... i'm glad i made a couple of the characters younger.. it makes their struggles a little more epic when it's ""kids"" versus manic adults....


i'd say no stealing these ideas...but who am i kidding.. they're still in the super ultra lame ass cliche stage..XD
but seriously... these plot holes are my little brain babies....i love them and their complete stupidity"

i met with Osborne today to show him my portfolio and sketchbook...he pretty much forced me to do the Disney interview even though the Disney rep wanted pre-juniors and up....he thinks he can wangle an interview for me.. SHAZAM!!!
he said i'd have no problem getting jobs at these places...it's just a matter of picking which one i want... but i don't want to jinx anything..i'm so excited!
Hasbro is in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.... Fisher-Price is in East Aurora, New York...Disney Stores is in either Burbank or Pasadena, California....

i'm hoping i get the Disney one....i know it's a lot of licensing toys but you probably get to see a lot of 5 years in the future work....so toys for upcoming sekret movies... there's one fashion intern opening and then one id opening.... but last quarter two industrial design students snagged both the fashion and the id one.. so who knows..... i'm hoping for the fashion!!! could you imagine? little kid's disney costumes?! so cute!!! and plushes!! eeee

interview and co-op mayhem aside.... working on handle designs for gardening tools geared towards the Smith & Hawkins set..... focusing on human factors.... it's really interesting but all of us can't help cracking up... because all of our ideation sketches look exceptionally phallic.....

yay


favorite customer encounter of the day:
Erin: -is handing out little black shopper bags for overly zealous semi-annual sale shoppers-
Erin: -hands one to an old lady with a crap load of bras- Would you like a bag to help carry your stuff while you shop?
Old Lady: thank you -takes bag, shoves horde into bag, hands bag back to me, and continues to shop-
Erin: ummmm

i love when they think we'll go as far as to carry your shit around for you.....not...
and ps...that is also not the first time this has happened...

ah well...no more bras, no more flashage, no more pointless one sided arguments with self righteous middle aged women...aaaaaaaaaaahhh -rips out hair- i can't stand the mall!!!!!!!!

in other news...have moved back into the apartment....and Mao is finally content....he is all happy happy purr purr and curled up on my couch....


also....i still have cable....when they totally said it would be turned off in december.... awesome

and i am full of delicious indian food....

"event","yay my computer has a brand spanking new non warped battery,
I haven't died in any completely spaced out car collisions yet (no lie),
and i've got intense wii shoulder!!!!!


2008 is going to be awesome....i can feel it....

in other news my entire family refuses to play monopoly with me..and by my entire family i mean two people...
:( it is times like these i wish i had siblings.....

i also really want a wii now (thanks kate)...but cannot afford one....well...i can...but i can't help but wonder if i should put my money to better use.....like clothes..or food....i think i went through this with the ultimate bumblebee transformers toy...which i still don't have.....-sadness-

or i just won't buy anything ever and continue to horde money away for a brand spanking new 2009 chevy camaro -twitch- or a dodge challenger....-double twitch- which by then i probably still won't be able to even pay 1/3 of the down payment to even begin leasing one....

in other news...Charlie the cabrio is the falling apart......D: my parents say the tires need alignment or...maybe my engine..or..something...the angry man at the costco tire center car fixing department says salt and that i'm an idiot....and my gut says....that i better win that damn bumblebee camaro car by january 30th damnit....so i can race it on the streets...i mean drive ....places.......while obeying the rules....of the road.....

sigh.......somedays i just wish i could be adopted by angelina jolie and brad pitt...and they will buy me all that my secretly materialistic heart wants.......alas"

"event","more immortals drivel while it's still fresh in my brain...
i swear i get the best inspiration when i'm driving in the car..
also also..some sushi gang plot drivel as well....because i can

Immortals soundtrack updated:
Starlight - Muse (opening song)
Stronger - Kanye West
How Far We've Come - Matchbox Twenty 
What I've Done - Linkin Park
Not Gonna Get Us - T.A.T.U.
The W.A.N.D. - The Flaming Lips
Misery Business - Paramore
Immigrant Song - Led Zeppelin
Battle Without Honor or Humanity - Tomoyasu Hotei
Pretty Handsome Awkward - The Used
No One - Alicia Keys
Ordinary World - Duran Duran (end credits song)

basically songs that work with plot moments and reflect characters.......and that when heard in the car spew forth excessive inspiration... EXCESSIVELY

Character names so far:
James (fifth immortal), Piper (weapons specialist), ""no name"" (super strength robot), Eve (finder), ""no name"" (copy cat)........yeah.... not much in that department....but i've already got ""episodes"" mapped out... good lord... i wish i could animate/produce this into a live action feature of AWESOME....ness
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thighofblue/pic/0002fgd3/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thighofblue/pic/0002fgd3/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
ph33r my mad photoboothing skillz...and my lack of a good scanner...
left to right (and mirrored..sigh): James, ""copy cat"", Eve, ""robot"", Piper
i love Eve's character design so much...love love love
and names for ""copy cat"" have gone from Edward to Sam to Edward again....but i really hate both of those names for his character.....oh well...something will come to me eventually....as well as a good style for all of the characters that is concise and doesn't look like a horrible mesh of generic deviant art and anime.... -face into desk-
also...the robot's name is Floyd in my brain right now...but i have a feeling there's already a famous robot named floyd somewhere in the world already......it needs to work well with the name Piper....because they are an ass kicking team...and their names need to mesh well when shouted in a battle cry...

Sushi Plot so far:
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thighofblue/pic/0002gksx/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thighofblue/pic/0002gksx/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
the gang as kids...so cute...and all in bathing suits because they live in Cali!
left to right (mirrored again...via photobooth): Green Tea Girl, Miso Soup Boy, Fortune Cookie Boy, Sake Girl, Sushi Girl, Kim Chi Boy

ages in the children arc:
Fortune Cookie Boy and Miso Soup Boy: 8 
Sake Girl, Sushi Girl, and Kim Chi Boy: 7
Green Tea Girl: 6

Green Tea Girl is Fortune Cookie's little sister... that's the only sibling package in the group..so she tags along by default...

ages in the teen arc:
FC Boy and MS Boy: 17
Sake Girl, Sushi Girl, and Kim Chi Boy: 16
GT Girl: 15
i think.....i dunno yet....i feel like i'm doing a rugrats plot hole....alas

real life names so far:
Fortune Cookie Boy: Jonathen, ""Nate"", but everyone calls him ""Lucky"" (inspired by Dill from To Kill a Mockingbird whose full real name is obnoxiously long and doesn't really fit the kid Charles Baker Harris"")

Sake Girl: Alice (because i said so) and she'll punch you in the face if you try to abbreviate it to Ali (ally)

Pairs in the group:
Green Tea girl and Miso Soup Boy
Sake Girl and Fortune Cookie Boy
Sushi Girl and Kim Chi Boy
luuurrrvvvvvv....they're not a fully formed plot and i've already paired them off....

while i'm at it.. James and Piper and then Eve and ""copycat""....duuurr huuurrr -slapped with toast-

i should draw this stuff out nice....and do actual character pose/facial reference sheets..and do all the background layouts and vehicle designs i've come up with...and villians...and plot points.... sigh.....

also...other plot drivel.... LITTLE KIDS SHOW OF AWESOME!!! omg

THE ADVENTURES OF TOASTER CAT!!!!
and speaker bunny...along with the salt 'n pepa mice........so excited -inner little 2 year old-
-insert bad photobooth drawing pictures hur-
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thighofblue/pic/0002hdd2/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/thighofblue/pic/0002hdd2/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

speaker bunny has since been redesigned into my own...with his ears attached by cords so they sit away from his body and drag behind him when he moves about or perks his head up.....
i'll do a nice drawing of them someday....


blerghidy blergh.....nicktoons! book....how you've inspired me to want my own tv show.....but oh how hard it is to come up with something unique clever and with a different design then what's out there right now.....and to have the plot be culminated in under 25 minutes..with commercial breaks......

oh woe...unto my brain....and my geekness....."

why the hell do i care? anyways...up since 4:00 A fucking M  my brain is mush with a side of more hysterical mush

and last minute day before christmas eve shoppers are the bitchiest of the BITCH ...NO LIE....one of the girls at the cash wrap accidently fumbled this guys change dropping some coins on the counter...which then happened to bounce on the ground...he glared at her ..then THREW A BRA AT HER!!!! WUT THE FUCK!?!??! assault...seriously...fucking minimum wage.assault.... if i was her...i would have launched myself over the counter and punched him in the balls.....

of course...i was also a lot more on edge then her...she just looked at him coolly and had him pick the bra back up and hand it to her like a civilized person... hahahahahahha lucky of him...if he'd done that to me he'd have spent christmas in the hospital...and would be completely sterile..>:O

it's not normal for human BEANS to stand around in cheap black flats for 8 hours straight...with only fifteen minutes to run down to the overly packed food court, wait 10 minutes in line at subway, then hork down a 6 inch turkey sub in about 2 minutes, race back, and be flashed repeatedly..

such was my day.... :(


on the brightest of bright notes ever!!!!! bought myself a christmas gift.. the Nickelodeon art book of slime covered orgasmic awesome...and the woman was sooo nice...she gave me a freebie coupon discount..took about 12 dollars off.....and then my dad bought me not so secret ""christmas"" books.... car ones...because i've started down a very dark industrial design path.....
Chevy, Mustang, and Muscle cars..... squeee

in the past few days celebrated awesomeness at corinne's barbie twentieth....which was awesome..and i loved how monica actually dressed as crocodile hunter barbie...complete with safari dress and galoshes....at a bowling alley..
hahahhahahaha i was...as usual...token ethnic barbie...not very hard....XD

watched Serenity...which was crap...but i took on the mindset to watch it as television....instead of as a movie....because it was a crap movie....the only thing the possibly saved in my mind was Jayne...and his muscular buttocks...XD -slapped with fish-

then watched the Constant Gardener...... am going to adopt so many babies.... O_O so many
not that that really had anything to do with the plot..but i'm going to be like.. Angelina....times five hundred...

which...considering..... i'll end up with a brad pitt times five hundred.....

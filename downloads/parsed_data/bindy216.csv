"event","Much has changed since I last blogged.  I no longer have my career as a gadget salesman to write about, as I resigned honorably from the Sharper Image (AKA they were going to fire my ass so I bailed in the middle of my shift).  I have moved out of the Wakeley house and back to my parents' in an ill-conceived attempt to save money (I still have none).  I have traveled far and wide and done real research (and acquired some freaky undiagnosed illness).  Living with the parents again has really opened my eyes to how different it is when you live on your own, and how living with the parents makes you feel like a kid again.  

TOP 10 REASONS THAT LIVING WITH THE PARENTS AT AGE 21 IS LIKE BEING A LITTLE KID AGAIN

#10- My Mom wakes me up in the morning.  Instead of telling me I'm going to be late for school, she tells me I'll be late for work.  And I still ignore her.

#9- My parents still admonish me to pick up after myself.  But now, instead of picking up toys, I'm supposed to pick up car keys, cell phone and other Bindy-related detritus.

#8- My mom does my laundry.  As a kid, I would let the laundry pile up and my mom would do it, no questions asked.  I do the same thing now.  Works like a charm.

#7- I have no social life.  When you're a kid and you can't drive, you depend on your parents to drive you places.  When you're 21 and living at home, in the farthest reaches of suburbia, the good bars and your closest friends are a really long car ride away.  So you don't go out.

#6- My parents stay up later than me.  When I was a kid, my parents would always send me to bed before them.  Now, I send myself to bed before them.  ""Why?"" you may ask.  Please reference #7.

#5- You fight with your siblings.  My younger brother and I used to fight all the time.  He used to take my toys and my Nintendo games.  Now he takes my Xbox games and my clothes.  Fucker.

#4- Your mom tries to get you to go grocery shopping with her.  When I was little, my mom would always try to haul me to the grocery store to help her pick out food.  I would avoid it like the plague.  Now I piss and moan about the lack of food in the house.  But when she offers to bring me to the store and pick stuff out, I'm like ""Hell no.""

#3- Your mom makes appointments for you.  For 4 years, when I wasn't living at home, I made doctor, dental, and haircut appointments.  Now after living at home for 3 months, I can officially say that my mom has made all of those for me this summer.

#2- You parents don't approve of what you watch on TV.  When I was little, my mom banned me from watching MTV and eventually had MTV turned off of the cable.  Now she gets pissed when I Tivo movies like ""Freddy vs. Jason.""  ""That's stupid,"" she says.  ""Why would you watch that?""  Hey woman, reference #7 found above.  It's your fault anyway for having 40 goddamn movie channels.

#1- YOU TRY TO GET YOUR PARENTS TO BUY YOU STUFF.  I used to always bug my Dad whenever we went somewhere.  ""Dad, will you buy me that GI Joe?""  ""Dad, will you buy me that book?""  Now:  ""Mom, how would you feel about paying my cell phone bill?""  ""Mom, I think you should buy me some new shoes.""  Sometimes it gets really pathetic.  ""Oh, that's a nice pan.  Will you buy me that pan?""  It didn't used to work and it still doesn't.  Especially after your parents remind you how much money they spent on your college education.

I hope you find that entertaining.  Just remember that if you laughed at any of it, you are in fact laughing at me and my pathetic life.  Go ahead.  In the immortal words of Stewie from ""Family Guy,""  ""Whatever helps you sleep at night, Bitch.""

In the spirit of listing things, I am going to list many of my favorite words and the reasoning behind them.

Ginormous:  when 'giant' or 'enormous' just won't cut it.  Especially useful for talking about fatties.
            SENTENCE:  ""Oh my God!  That bitch was ginormous!""

Biatch:  when a girl is being a bitch but you know she'll get pissed if you say it.  For some reason, girls
         don't get mad when you call them a biatch, even though the word ""bitch"" will get your balls  
         ripped off.  Also useful as a conversation starter on AOL Instant Messenger.
         SENTENCE:  ""Jill Mayhan, you are such a dirty biatch.""

Janky (variant: jankity):  describes anything that doesn't work the way it's supposed to.  Whether it's
                           broken or just a little bit off, this word works wonders.  Jankity is usually
                           used when describing people.
                           SENTENCE:  ""God my car is janky.""
                           SENTENCE:  ""That girl's face was kind of jankity.  Her eyes didn't line up.""

GOOOOO!:  (Rhymes with oooooh, not go) used as an exclamation whenever a particularly hideous person
           comes into view.  This expression was used a lot by our research group this summer, especially 
           on the beach in Virginia.
           SENTENCE:  (huge 300 pound fatty in a swimsuit spotted) (group says) GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Tramp:  A classic.  Much more fun than ""skank"" or ""ho"" due to its old world charm.  I love this word.
        SENTENCE:  ""Oh Erin Koncak, you are such a tramp.""
        (Writer's note: I have never called Erin Koncak a tramp to her face, because I value my life.  I 
         can only hope that in the interest of humor and entertainment, she will spare my life for this
         particular indiscretion.)

Look for a new blog soon where I will continue with more of my favorite words, and perhaps a new list of things that I hate."

"event","It was exactly two months ago tonight that I last blogged.....and it's high time for a new entry because I've got a lot to say!  The past few weeks have been quite interesting.  I was fired from my job at the mall (I really can't figure out why...I was such a good employee!).  Apparently, employers get irritated when you no-call no-show (I think the number of times was somewhere in the double digits) and when you forget to tell them you won't be at work because you are on spring break....ooops! My bad.  So I was fired from Sharper Image after nearly a year of hijinks.....only to get a call asking me if I wanted to work there again!  So after 'enthusiastically' accepting with ""Umm...I suppose"" I was re-hired.  Early today was my first time back at the mall in over a month, and I had to make my own fun.  One thing about the Sharper Image is that the fuckheads in upper management think that the store needs to be re-organized about every week or so.  I was approached by many customers today (fucking bastards....leave me the hell alone!  Can't you see that I'm working????  This counter IS NOT going to hold itself up...it needs my support!!!) who were looking for a product.  Since I hadn't worked in forever, I had no clue where any of this crap was in the store.  So I wandered aimlessly like a retard separated from the short bus, trying in vain to find these items.  I actually had two customers ask me if it was my first day.  So naturally, I told them that it was.....""how am I doing?"" I asked them.  They just looked at me funny.  Yeah, that happens to me a lot.  Another customer told me that I looked like someone from the Partridge Family and that my hair was ""out of control."".  I didn't have the heart to tell her that she looked like an alcoholic version of Miss Piggy...dirty swine bitch.  I am fucking awesome and no pig-lady will say anything to the contrary!  A crazy customer told me I couldn't have his name and address to put in the computer because he didn't want ""Big Government"" collecting information on him.  Whatever.  Go back to your shack you loony-ass Unabomber.  Go write your Manifesto.  I also saw some gross and disturbing PDA today.  I was standing behind the counter, minding my own business, when out of nowhere I saw a hideous-looking girl and her rat-faced boyfriend going at it in the middle of the store.  The worst part about it was that the girl was at least 8 months pregnant.  She was fucking huge.  That is not anything I need to see.  If I wanted to see stomach-wrenching displays of affection, I would just hang out with Joey and Jen more (Sorry guys....too clever of me to pass up!)!!!!!!  Around 3:00 I started to get pissy, and had to regulate on some customers.  I blurted out ""Fuck!"" in front of two old people when I dropped an armful of shitty, overpriced products, drawing an immediate reprimand from my manager (like I care).  I informed a young mother that I ""wasn't running a daycare"" and I ""didn't get paid to clean up after her child.""  She responded that he was only 3 and didn't know what he was doing.  I responded with a hearty, ""Bitch please!!"" (OK, not really, but I did stare at her in icy silence for a good 30 seconds.  She scooped up the evil product of her womb and high-tailed it out of there.  Score another one for Bindy!)  Score is now- 
Bindy: 1,000,000
Customers: -5   

But the best victory of the day was my victory over two old people.  I will try to faithfully recreate the conversation as follows:
Me: ""Hi.  Can I answer any questions for you today?""
Old Guy:  ""Oh, hi.  My wife and I are looking for a clock that tells time."" (I'm NOT exaggerating!!!)
Me:  ""Um, you want a clock that tells time? We have lots of those.""
Old Guy:  ""Yes, we need a new clock.  Our old one stopped working.""
Old Guy's Wife:  ""Do you have a clock with big numbers?""
Me:  ""Like a digital clock?""
Old Guy's Wife:  ""Yes, I think so.  Not one with the hands.""
Me (thinking to myself): what nursing home did these nutty old fucks escape from?
Me (for real): ""OK...these clocks are digital and they have large numbers.""
Old Guy's Wife:  ""They don't look bright enough.  I need to be able to see it in the dark.  How bright is it in the dark?""
Me:  ""I'm not really sure....I think they're all pretty bright.""
Old Guy:  ""Well can we see it?""
Me:  ""You mean in the dark?""
Old Guy:  ""Yes.""
Me:  ""Well, I can't turn off the lights.  It's against company policy (my favorite way of saying ""fuck no!"" to a customer).""
Me:  (quickly changing subject)  ""Do you need an alarm and a radio?""
Old Guy's Wife:  ""We don't need a radio....so much of it is indecent!"" (again, I am NOT exaggerating)
Me:  ""OK....well, I would recommend this clock.  It has large numbers and an alarm.  It also plugs in and doesn't need any batteries."" 
Old Guy:  ""This one here with the weather forecaster in it?""
Me:  ""That's the one.""
Old Guy:  ""This clock costs 150 dollars!!!!!"" (this guy is giving me the most hilarious look)
Me:  ""It's the brightest one we carry!""  (total lie...I have no fucking idea.)
Old Guy's Wife:  ""OK, we'll take it.""

God, I'm awesome.  Nothing improves your mood like ripping off crazy old people. 

I had an Indian customer today (dot, not feather; you know you were wondering).  He was asking me about something and I could not understand a single thing he said.  He would babble in his own form of English for awhile about something and I would smile and nod.  Then I would pick up the camcorder he was standing close to (I think its what he was interested in) and talk about some random feature, obviously not related to whatever he was talking about.  He became increasingly frustrated with my inability to help him.  So I gave him my card and a catalog and sent him on his way.  
Coversation as follows---note-this IS exaggerated.  Extremely exaggerated.  And offensive. VERY OFFENSIVE.  If you do not handle ethnic humor well, do not read this.

Indian Gentleman: ""blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah.  blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah.  Shiva vishnu. blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah.  Karma.""

Probable Translation:  ""I am looking for an elephant for my daughter's dowry.  Please point me in the direction of an animal vendor.""

Me:  ""This camcorder has a 100x zoom and a 12 hour battery life!""

Indian Gentleman:  ""blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah.  Brahma.  blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah.  Dharma.  Bodhisatva.""

Probable Translation:  ""Please tell me where I can find Kumud Sualy.  I want to hit a piece of that!""

Me:  ""This camcorder stores images and video on mini-DVD discs.  They are rewritable!""

Indian Gentleman:  ""blahblahblahblahblahblah.  Ahimsa.  Satyagraha.  blahblahblahblah Krishna.""

Probable Trabslation:  ""Stupid honky.  I'm going to go Gandhi on your ass.""

Me:  ""Here's a catalog and my card.  You have a nice day sir!""   

Oh, Sharper Image.  I love to hate that place.  And I'm spent."

"event","Working the desk again.  I have no homework to do (not that I would do it if I did) so I am wasting time on Facebook and playing with iTunes.  I have decided since my last entry that working the desk is even more worthless than i originally thought.  So I decided that tonight I would have to make my own fun.  Earlier this evening, a resident (who i recognized) walked in and was getting on the elevator.  So for shits and giggles I jumped up and yelled at him to come back and show me his ID (which I never do).  So he did, and I pretended to compare his name to one on a list I had behind the desk.  I then informed him that he was banned from the building and should contact Residence Life with any questions.  He had a look of complete terror on his face, and began rambling on about how he lived here and couldn't possibly be banned.  I stared at him silently for a good 10 seconds before looking at his ID and the list again.  I then said, ""Oh sorry!  Wrong person!"" and smiled politely.  He got on the elevator and went upstairs.  I began laughing hysterically at what I had done.  Stupid?  Yes.  Immature?  Yes.  Funny?  Oh God, yes!  
So anyway, it is now about 2:15 in the morning and I just hit my leg on a cabinet behind the desk.  It hurt really bad and I yelled ""FUCK"" really loud, but no one was around to hear it.  I kicked the cabinet for good measure, and left a dent.  I feel satisfied.  

OK, so earlier today I saw something that really weirded me out.  So I'm sitting in class this afternoon (a long class, 3:30-6:00) and this girl on the other side of the room does the strangest thing.  She pulls out this yarn and a big-ass needle-y thing and starts knitting or something.  This really put me off so I continued to glance at her out of the corner of my eye every 15 minutes or so.  And she didn't stop.  She continued to knit for the entire class.  I didn't quite figure out what she was making, only that it was blue and white with an ugly-ass pattern.  Several observations about this:

#1:  Who the fuck does that!!???!  Who knits?  Jesus Christ, my grandmother doesn't even do shit like that.  What in the hell is wrong with this girl?

#2:  Who does that in class???  Did this girl think it was OK that she was knitting?  Its not like a person thats constantly knitting can take notes.  Is knitting somehow a socially acceptable thing to do in class?  Is there some secret code in academia that it is OK to make clothing in class?  What about other hobbies?  As many of you may know, my roommate (a brown kid who shall remain nameless) has a passion he often indulges for sorting folders and papers.  What if someone did that in class?  I enjoy sleeping and drinking beer.  Is it OK for me to get drunk and pass out in the middle of a lecture?  I think not!

#3:  What the hell was she knitting?  Judging from her personal appearance, this girl doesn't care what others think of her.  Perhaps the atrocious thing she was creating was for her.  I mean in all seriousness, I knew SPED kids in high school that dressed better than this girl does.  That's right.  I knew retards cooler than her.  Then I got to thinking that maybe she was making it for a baby.  This led me to thinking that perhaps she had a baby, which led me to almost throw up in my mouth at the mental picture that followed.  I certainly hope she doesn't have a baby.  That poor creature would have some serious genetic obstacles to overcome.  But anyway, I digress.........WHO THE FUCK KNITS? Jesus!

OK, this has led me to think of things that have irritated me in the past few days.  So here we go.

#1-Girls who freak out when you say ""panties.""  Jesus, what are you, 7?  I said ""panties!""  Get over it!  Would you like me to say ""cunt?"" Because if ""panties"" bugs you, I can't wait to see your reaction when I bust out the c-word!

#2-White kids at Creighton who try to be ""gangsta.""  Who the fuck are you kidding?  You're not tough.  I know 12 year old girls who could kick your ass.  You go to a private Catholic school.  You're about as far from gangsta as one can possibly get.  The pants you sag so far down your ass?  You bought them at the mall with mommy and daddy's credit card.  Don't lie.  Your manner of speaking?  You got it from Jamie Kennedy in ""Malibu's Most Wanted.""  Your ""pimp-ass ride?""  It's a nice family sedan that mommy and daddy bought for you.  Please.  Stop it now.  Everyone hates you.  In fact, hatred of your idiocy is serving to bring people of different ethnic backgrounds together.  On second thought, keep doing what you're doing.  We all need a laugh now and then.

#3-Bastard Med Students.  So I've noticed through experiences at Creighton that many of the med students are in fact dirty bastards.  I can't tell you how many times I have held the door for a med student (and you can always tell who they are, the girls get ugly from the stress and the guys just look like douche bags) and not received even a smile, let alone a thank you.  I also can't tell you how many times I've walked into the building behind a med student and had the door slam shut in my face.  You know what?  I realize you are going to be a doctor someday (if you don't fail out) but you need a lesson in common courtesy.  Would it really hurt you to hold the door?  Would it wear out your ""scalpel arm?""  Would you miss 0.8 seconds of valuable study time?  You bastards!  Fuck you!  Someday I will find every one of you godless sons of bitches and sue you for malpractice!  So, in closing, to all med students:  Hold the door, don't be such a slutbag, and please make sure that when you do add those two letters to the end of your name (which you will doubtless flaunt until the day you die)that your insurance premiums are paid up so you can show me the money!

Anyway, thats enough for tonight.  My desk shift is over, and I'm peacing out.  We will continue this discussion of things that irritate me and piss me off (which is quite extensive) at a later date."

"event","Yeah, so I am going to join the millions of people who think that they're really cool and creative and try my hand at ""blogging"" or whatever the hell it's called.  Do I think anyone will really read this?  No.  Do I think anyone should be subjected to my idiotic and cynical rambling?  Definitely no.  Oh well.  Anyway, today was a very boring yet somewhat amusing day.  I didn't drag my lazy ass out of bed until about 12:30 or so, and then I proceeded to do absolutely nothing (what I'm best at) for about five hours.  Then I went to Chipotle with my roommate and his g/f (playing third wheel, also something I excel at since I'm a loser and no one will date me).  Boring up to this point.  But while we were there some little kid pulled the fire alarm so it was shrieking ridiculously loud.  At this point, the little kid starts wailing and covering his ears, like he had been traumatized.  Well, it was his own fault.  Little bastard.  Everyone in the restaurant seemed to think it was sort of cute, kind of a ""kids will be kids"" moment.  Except me.  I hate little kids.  It was not cute.  It was obnoxious.  Anyone my age that wants to have kids or has even entertained the thought is a fucking moron.  Ok, so I'm done with that situation.  But I seriously hate kids.  I spent the rest of the evening going to a meeting (boring, waste of my time), studying (not really studying, but doing a fine job of distracting all those around me, waste of my time) and being subjected to an Ultimate Fighting Championship special on TV by my roommate(those guys are fucking crazy, waste of my time).  It also appears that there is some sort of trash boycott in my house.  At last check, there were three trash bags tied up and full of trash in the living room (??!?) and assorted paper trash all over the kitchen.  One of my roommates claims he is on ""picking up shit strike"" which I thought was really funny.  I guess that's my excuse for the sorry state of my bedroom.  Speaking of which, I can no longer walk through my bedroom with the lights off for fear of injuring myself.  There is so much shit strewn across the floor, I swear to God I sometimes forget what color the carpet is.  I really need to get on that.  I'm just really lazy.  It is now about 3:50 Monday morning and I'm working the Kenefick desk.  My job is to ""ensure the security and safety of the residents of Kenefick Hall.""  Isn't that Public Safety's job?  Oh wait....they're busy patrolling the parking lots to ensure the safety of student vehicles.....Oh wait...that's not quite right.  As I recall, my roommate's car was stolen in broad daylight from THE PARKING LOT NEXT TO PUBLIC SAFETY!  Now I find that hilarious.  What specific Public is receiving this elusive Safety?  Whoever it is, I think I speak for everyone on campus when I say that that Public better give us back the Safety that they stole from us.  Now!  Anyway, I'm working the desk (providing security and safety!) and I'm pretty sure that if anyone really wanted to get into Kenefick, they probably wouldn't listen to my feeble attempts to stop them.  Or would they?????

Angry-potentially-homicidal-person-trying-to-get-in:  ""ARGH!  I'm coming in!""

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker (Me, in case you're retarded and didn't figure it out):  ""Do you have your ID?""

A.P.H.P.T.T.G.I.:  ""NO!""

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker:  ""Ummmmmm...do you live here?""

A.P.H.P.T.T.G.I.:  ""NO!""

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker:  ""Ummmmmm...are you visiting someone?""

A.P.H.P.T.T.G.I.:  ""NO!""

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker:  ""Ummmmmm...what do you want then?""

A.P.H.P.T.T.G.I.:  ""TO KILL!""

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker:  ""Ummmmmm...you'll have to take that up with Residence Life.""

A.P.H.P.T.T.G.I.:  ""YOU DIE NOW SKINNY MAN!""

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker:  ""Ummmmmm...I have a panic button.  If I push it, Public Safety might call   me within 5 minutes to make sure I pushed it.  And then, if I tell them to come, they'll be here in 15 to 45 minutes.  And then, they will overpower you with their flabby middle-aged physiques and wait for the real cops to come.""

A.P.H.P.T.T.G.I.:  ""HA HA HA.....NOW YOU DIE!""

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker:  ""Ummmmm...I'm going to call the RA.  They will overpower you with their smugness and false sense of authority.  They will knock you over with their special ""power trip"" move that they have all mastered.  And then, if you still won't give up, they will pull out their mighty pad and paper and WRITE YOU UP!  You will be at the mercy of the University judicial system!  They will subjugate you with their silly rules and regulations, shame you with their false sense of moral superiority, and punish you with a firm slap on the wrist!""

A.P.H.P.T.T.G.I.:  ""I'M CRAZY!  BUT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY A DUMBASS!  I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU!"" (person leaves.)

Skinny Kenefick Deskworker:  ""I win!""

Yeah...it would probably go something like that.  Anyways, it is time for me to stop writing, because I have almost used up my sarcasm allotment for the day (yes, it does get used up!).  Maybe I should finally study for that Stats test tomorrow......."

"event","Teiaiel is someone that I have never written of before, though I have known him for a very long time.  He is one of the Host, and is known as the Angel of the Futures.  I am one of the few beings he trusts with his visions, and the ones he shared with me now he bade me to write about in this journal.  It was quite startling to hear him say this as his usual wishes are that I keep what I know to myself, and just act accordingly.  Why is this time different?  I know not, but as per his request, I shall write about what he told me.
The first vision is quite startling.  He saw Gem dressed as a bride and uniting herself with the forces of Hell.  Her beauty was radiant, and it shone from her in a corona of light.  I know that Teiaiel's visions are often symbolic and are to be interpreted in a variety of manners.  This one could mean many things, but all as of yet, paths it could point to are something that I should like to prevent however I can.  
The second vision concerned Rei.  He saw him in a play acting the part of Paris in the Greek story where he was asked by three goddesses to judge who was the most beautiful.  Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite.  In the story, Paris chose Aphrodite but in the vision Rei started to ad-lib his lines and instead declared them all equally lovely.  Instead he turned to choose someone in the audience but the glare of the spotlight made it impossible to see who that choice might have been.
The third vision was of Satan, the Devil, and Lucifer himself sitting around a table and each of them drinking a cup of tea.  The floor was covered with red rose petals, and the walls were a gleaming white.  Each of their teacups held blood within it and they were sharing with each other how it got there.  
That is all.  
On a more personal note, I have been given word that I should watch after Gem closely as trouble is again stirring about her.  Considering what I was told in the first vision, I shall be ever more vigilant.  I am even considering sending a missive to Ereven himself, but I do not know how to go about doing this and not breach diplomatic boundaries.  I will think long and hard on this."

"event","This night was quite busy for business at the Rambling Rose Tavern.  It was also rather productive for my own personal concerns.  I saw Vadriel there and I agreed to sing to the spirits so that he might have a chance to rest.  Many of these spirits are lost souls of the drowned dead, and I am troubled to learn about this.  Vadriel and I speculated that Cristof might have a hand in this, but there is no way of telling.  Mer must have sensed that I wished to speak to her about this, for mere moments after speaking with Angelin, Mer herself arrived at the tavern.  I spoke with her about Cristof and offered her my assistance in this regard.  Happily she accepted.

Seamus is resting like I asked, and I am grateful to see this.  The conversation shifted over towards Zohak, and I told Mer about his existence.  She expressed a desire to meet him so I sent a missive along to one of his guardians.  

I am going to sing some more now.  I shall write more as I find the time."

"event","I do not know what to make of the other night.  It is so strange to interfere so directly in the lives of mortals, but the other night I did.  Seamus is someone that I hold in esteem and it pains me to see him suffer so.  Mortals should not suffer like this, but alas things are arranged now that they must.  They suffer, they age, they die.  It hurts sometimes to witness this.

I told Seamus he needed to rest for his own good.  I tried to be gentle at first but he refused to listen.  Seamus feels safer when he is working, but his body cannot handle such pressures all the time.  He needs to learn how to rest.  There is a reason why there is a day set aside for rest.  Even the Lord Above needed rest.  I would tell him that, but I do not know if it would make much difference.  I can only hope now that his wife shall be firm with him.

My brother was distressed the other night due to this occurrence.  He wanted to help and he was most unhappy that things are destined to remain as they are.  He means well, but he can be overwhelming sometimes.  He was always the sort that moved through existence with blinding intensity.  Few creatures I know love life and humanity as much as Azazel does.  His burning love for humanity is what got him in trouble in the first place.  It is also what saved him in the end when he sought to return to the light.

Existence is just not fair sometimes."

"event","A few nights ago as I was wandering about the land, it came to my attention that it was the night of Gem's birth, so I stopped by her place to wish her well.  Her home was swarming with people, and that was truly not a surprise.  Gem is a very social creature and she has many friends.  I am glad for this.  I gave her a pair of my own earrings that I hope will be of some use to her.  They have the property of blocking out her mind against unwanted mental probes.  Something I think will be of the best use when she is working behind the bar.  I have seen how sometimes a being comes into the place with such mental powers and unscrupulously reads the minds of others.  I have also seen on one occasion a poor soul who just could not help but do so.  

I saw my brother during the celebration of Gem's birth.  Instead of merely watching him as I passed by, I actually walked up to him and spoke with him a little.  He seems so very troubled.  A shadow of his former self.  It is such a painful thing to witness, but alas this is something that is entirely out of my hands.  The best I can do is continue to watch over him as I have been doing.  However, this time I have his permission to do so.  I asked him if he would not mind if I came by every now and then to visit with him.  He agreed.  I gave him an item that I have been hanging onto for some time now.  It is a key that once had been kept within Hell itself and was guarded by one whose name I must not mention.  That being has since vacated the spot and position it once held, so I claimed the key for my own.  I know that this gift only served to perplex my brother, but unfortunately I could not tell him the true purpose behind it.  All I could tell him is that the item was his, and that he should guard it well.  

Last thing to note, Gem's mansion appears to be haunted by a friendly spirit of some kind.  The spirit seemed quite intent on speaking with my brother and only spoke directly to me briefly.  I asked him to watch over my brother and he agreed.  Eventually I should like to speak to this spirit some more, should he be willing to do so.  Thanks to Vadriel, I have spoken to a great deal of spirits of late.  They are all quite fascinating and many of them have quite the story to share with one willing and able to listen.

Regretfully, I had to leave the festivities early to take care of business that could not wait.  Such as it is now, so this is my closing thought for the day.  May all those that I have come to know have a safe and prosperous day.  I wish them well."

"event","Situations about the land have been calm enough for me of late that I have not seen fit to make any mention of anything within the pages of this journal.  However, it has occurred to me that there are three pressing issues upon my mind which I shall detail now.

Firstly, Gem has had her child and he is beautiful.  I care not what the Word or the Host might have to say about the Nephalim, this child is no monster.  He cannot be, nor will he be.  He is perfect in form, and greatly resembles his mother.  He has her silver white hair, her deep amethyst eyes, and her skin tone which is a lovely light mocha color.  The only thing I see that he has inherited from his father so far are the wings.  Two tiny downy gray wings.  I imagine that his adult plumage will be black, as Kakabel's wings tended to have a very shadowy manifestation.  This just remains to be seen.  I shall watch over him as carefully as I can, as Gem has entrusted me to care for her child when she is away.  I am greatly honored in her trust and shall endeavor to not let her down.

The second thing that is on my mind is my lost brother Kakabel.  He is currently staying with Gem right now.  He has forgotten much, and does not remember himself.  He does not remember me, his past, or anything of seeming significance.  I cannot say why this is so, but I do hope that when the time comes for his memories to be restored they do not harm him too much.  Kakabel has had a past that I would not wish on my most dire of foes.  Perhaps it is a mercy that he has forgotten everything.  As things stand, we seem to be avoiding each other.  Perhaps it is best that way for if he were to ask me questions, I could not lie to him.  I do not wish to trouble him more than he already is.  Let my poor, troubled brother have some peace.  Let that peace last as long as it possibly can.

The last thing I see fit to mention is of a personal nature.  I sang the song I made for Vadriel, and it seems to have moved him greatly.  I am happy.  Vadriel is one that I am very, very happy to spend my time with.  I could not ask for anything more."

"event","It has been some time since I have felt the need to write.  As usual, I have been quite busy performing my duties and trying to stay focused on what is good in the world.  It turns out that Mesteno has made a new friend that seems to make him quite happy.  I am very glad for this, and I wish the pair of them all the best that the world has to offer.  I have met Mesteno's new friend and he strikes me as a good person, though rather shy.  I just hope that my instincts are right about that one.  Speaking of Mesteno, I think that Puriel has chosen to leave matters alone at least for now and concentrate on demon hunting.  Knowing Puriel, this is only a temporary situation.

In other news, Gem has had her child early somehow.  It would seem that she enlisted the services of a man that has some kind of odd power over time.  He sped along the gestation period, but for some reason chose to send her ahead to the future to bear the baby when it was actually due to arrive.  It is fortunate that he chose to do things that way as the fabric of destiny shall remain intact.  I am now helping out by watching over the infant during those times that Gem has to report to work.  The Silver Moon Inn is an interesting place, but it can get rather dangerous sometimes.

Lastly, to the lost soul that came to me for help.  May you find that which it is that you seek.  My thoughts shall always be with you.  Good fortune and the blessings of all that is right in the world go with you."

"event","This is not good.  Powers above me have admonished the fact that I still walk the earth when I can and derive pleasures out of the earthly aspects of things.  They are most displeased with my choice of friends.  They do not understand that not everyone can be a saint and that these people are mortal with mortal concerns.  Surely they know I have been doing this for months.  Why should now be any different, when before it was not a concern?  Why act like it is suddenly new behavior?  I do not understand any of this.  

I have been told to strike one of my dearest friends down and walk away from the rest.  How can I?  I cannot do such a thing!  I will not do this to those I care about.  My place in the heavens is not worth it if it means that I have to hurt the ones I love.  If this was not enough, I am suddenly filled with images of every terrifying and horrible thing I have seen since I walked this land.  Perhaps it is a punishment for choosing to spend time here when I should be busy doing other things.  

I grow weary of it.  The endless violence.  People I grow close to perish, sometimes in my arms.  Body parts being scattered about one place, people trying to torture each other in another.  Pain, wrath, anger, hurt.  It all gets to be a bit too much at times.  Part of me understands the why of it all, while the other part wishes it would all go away.  I literally feel like I am being torn apart and there is nothing that anyone can do about it.

However, at the same token I cannot abandon those I have grown close to just because things have become harsh and ugly to me.  How can I help anyone if I run away from the pain?  I should never have run away.  I should not want to stay with humans forever, but I do.  I should not feel guilty about wishing to remain in heaven forever, but I do.  I do not understand myself.  

I am losing myself and nobody knows."

I feel bad for this, but I know that Mesteno has a very violent side that I will never be able to manage, no matter how much I might desire to.  Besides, I must remind myself that it is not my place to interfere and I do not have the right to manage anyone's life.  That is something they must do on their own.

"event","I am currently in the process of closing a deal on a particular piece of real estate as a gift to Mesteno for his birthday.  It is a modest sized building that was at one time a funeral home.  There are plenty of secret nooks, passages, and spaces scattered about this building as well as the requisite basement and sub-level.  The entirety of the place is rather gothic in design.  The place is even furnished, though Mesteno might want to sell off what is there and decorate it however he sees fit.  That is for him to decide.  

I am nearly positive that Mesteno will love it.  I have Revari to thank for her assistance in finding the perfect gift.  Mesteno will be given a house and the current owner of the building will be given my emerald earrings as that is what she wanted from me so that I could purchase the place.  I hope the earrings make her happy, but I am more hopeful that the house will make Mesteno happy.

It will be all his and it is what he wished for."

I am filled with this desire to give him a gift of gentleness, but I do not know how well that will go over with him as he is of a rather volatile nature.  Furthermore, he prizes what independence he has.  For this reason, I suppose the best thing to do is just let him be and watch him quietly as I have done so in the past.  I just wish that he could find peace.  I also know that he would be bored with peace, so I suppose the best thing to wish for is that he finds the sort of peace that will make him content and not bring harm to himself or anyone else.  Is such a thing possible?  Only God knows, and it is not a matter that I choose to trouble Him over."

"event","Truly I have no idea where to begin in stating the events that have recently transpired, so I shall just write and let things unfold as they may upon this parchment.  I suppose the thing that is weighing most heavily on my mind are the seeds of conflict I see brewing upon the horizon.  As of now I am bid to remain neutral in this conflict, but I do not know how long such a state will last.  There are a number of people caught up in this situation that I call friend and I cannot just sit by and watch while the others are drawn into battle.  Already there have been times when I was forced to do combat, and with each passing moment it seems that I am bid to do battle yet again.  It is not lost on me that I am being remade for war.  I am unhappy about this, but what must be shall ever be.  I cannot let my friends down, it is as simple as that.  

The other situation that is most on my mind is the summoning wizard that has of late seen fit to call upon me to perform any number of tasks.  He is most often interested in knowledge, thus Uriel and I are the most often summoned.  There are times though when he forces us to use our forces to fight for him.  How he came about having such power is still quite the mystery to me.  All of us long to put this upstart in his place, but find our hands tied.  We have to wonder how the Heavenly Father is allowing this to begin with.  What is the lesson here?  The purpose to it all?  One thing we have been able to discover is that Gadreel has his hand in this somehow.  

Lastly the other night I felt the tears of heartache of my brother and my friend.  It would appear that Gem has made the choice to let Kakabel go and move on with her life.  I am filled with a great deal of sorrow at this choice, but I suppose I can see the necessity of it when I let myself step back and look objectively at the situation.  So once again Kakabel is on his own, and his fate unknown.  When the time is right I shall seek him out and tell him that I am sorry for his loss and hope that he forgives me for my part I played in bringing he and Gem together and working on keeping them together when signs did indeed show that this was not something that was meant to last.  I shall also do the same for Gem, but when the time is right.  I can tell right now that she would rather be left alone, and that is a wish that I shall respect.

I must remember who I am and what it is that I stand for.  I must not lose faith or hope."

"event","I do wonder sometimes why I still have my wings and have not fallen back to the earth once more.  After all, a being that holds such personal hatred for a being should not be allowed to exist where I am, but yet here I still persist to be.  Perhaps it is because God knows that I am aware of this weakness to desire to do something about it and not let it consume me from within?  I do not know.  What I do know is that I cannot go on like this.  I have to forgive The Ripperman somehow.  He who is so beyond redemption, he who will persist for far too long, he who slew Brandy and cut my throat.  So much about that one.  He has a connection to Ivory, the details of which I still do not know about.  Frankly, I have not tried to find out about this.  I have been trying to forget that The Ripperman even exists.  That is not going to work.  Forgotten memories do have a nasty way of returning, and worse yet that will not solve my true problem.  I hate him and I must stop.  

I will need to think more on this.  I sought out my brother Kakabel and waited for him in his room. He told me what I needed to hear and confirmed what I already knew.  I cannot go one with such a feeling inside me, as it will just rot me away from within.  He is wise, my brother and I need him.  As we spoke on, I too helped him in my own way.  He speculated that God made us so that the problems of others are readily apparent, but our own problems are most confusing.  I am inclined to agree with him.  I do have an easier time doing what I can for others and neglecting myself.

On to other subjects at hand.  I saw Ivory today for the first time in a good, long while. She seems to be doing well, but needed to share some news with me that I swore I would not talk about here, or anywhere else for that matter.  Later on, the subject turned to Lars.  She had to bring up Lars, a being that I just cannot bring myself to like.  I do not hate him, but I cannot stand him either.  He is rude, crude, and about as subtle as an anvil raining from the sky to bash one on the head.  He annoys me, and I figure the feeling is quite mutual.  He probably sees me as a holier than thou goodie goodie.  Then again, he likely does not give a damn about me at all.  Either way, I really could not care.  What an arrogant pup.  I just hope that one day he will mature into something worthwhile.  He may have been created solely for sex but I think he can actually rise above that a not be such a machine to his programming.  I guess that is the true reason I find him so utterly irritating.  He is wasted potential.  I would tell him that, but I honestly do not think he would listen to me.  And Ivory?  I have to wonder if she would hope that I would actually speak to him.  I just cannot right now.

I saw Mesteno for the first time in a while as well.  He was quite drunk.  I think he expected me to lecture him, but I did not bother with that. He already knows what he is doing is not the right thing, so why rub his nose further into it?  What he needs now is support, not criticism.  He did tell me something that I found quite interesting, but I cannot think of it right now.  It was something relevant to his nature and what he gets out of drinking as he does.  In fact, it helped me understand why so many drink to excess, something I have been wondering for quite a while now.

I will not talk about Camael.  It hurts too much to even think about it.  

Seamus made me crab rangoon, something I am quite grateful for.  I came by the inn to collect them, but I cannot eat them right now as I have to get Ariana to bless them, but at the moment she is sleeping and I am not about to wake her, especially for such a trivial thing.  Thus, I just put them all back into the cold storage unit and will try again later after she has had some time to rest.  

I took Lady Calypso Proudfoot, the cat that I have been given to care for to meet Ariana.  The two seemed to get along quite well, even if Lady is quite the arrogant creature.  Ariana told her to behave, and so far she seems to be doing just that.  

Lastly, one final thought before I close for the day and return to Heaven to take care of my duties before coming back here to Vadriel's and just be blissful with him.  Suriel asked me the other day if I thought he was in danger of falling.  What am I supposed to make of that?  He seems to have his own inner worries.  I will speak with him about this and find out more.  

And now, duties call."

"event","At present it seems as though everyone about me is slowly, but steadily going mad in one form or another.  I wonder if I should include myself in this?  I do not know.  All I can say is that I am quite frustrated with the turn of events that have unfolded within these past few days.  Were I a human, I think that I would just be tearing my hair out about now.  

I suppose I shall start with the most frustrating thing and that is Camael.  His false giddiness has finally slipped away to reveal the tortured being within that is being consumed with the concept of an existence filled with nothing other than pain.  I tried to warn him about this, as it is very dangerous thinking and tried to offer him some ideas of how he can still do good in the world, but everything I had to say fell upon deaf ears.  I feel that with him it is either an all or nothing situation and that he sees the world in black and white terms.  You cannot do that in the mortal world as life as they know it is all in shades of gray.  Well, it would seem that he has begun the process of descending and I really do not know what to do about stopping and reversing this fate he has bestowed upon himself.  He will not listen to me, anyone, or anything else save for his own twisted thoughts.  So stubborn, and so convinced he is in the right of things.  So lost.  I know that only he can save himself and all I or anyone else can do is just try and show him the error of his ways, but it still is a painful thing to watch.  It is utterly tempting to forsake him because there is really little I can do, but I just cannot do such a thing.  I fear that abandoning him will just add fuel to his inner fires.  Besides, I have to try even if I might fail.  That in the end is all I have left.  To not try is to automatically fail.  Now enough said about this.  It is entirely out of my hands now.

Suriel lately has been rather restless and I have a strong suspicion as to why that is.  He has become dissatisfied with his position and quite curious as to this thing called life.  He is very quiet about his inner thoughts, but he and I are rather alike in many ways, so it is not much of a stretch to ponder what might be going on within that one's inner thoughts.  I just wish he would cease being so frustrating and communicate with me.  He knows a few things about what is going on with my Vadriel as well as the situation with Gem and Kakabel but he will not tell me.  This leaves me little choice but to do my own investigating.  I shall begin with the Vadriel that is my brother and see if I can persuade him to enlighten me.

As far as Tom is concerned, I know that there is something upsetting him, but I am not exactly sure what it is.  He is such a volatile creature and I am utterly confounded by him more times than not.  I said the wrong thing some time ago to him and it made him utterly furious with me.  From what I gather, I accidentally shamed him and that made him quite angry and he actually struck me.  It was not my intention of doing such a thing, I just had hoped that I could give him a suggestion about how to go about getting the sleep that he so desperately needs.  Tom's striking out at me upset Gem and she intervened on my behalf and had a few words with Tom.  I had already forgiven him as I know that he is not rational when he is fully rested.  And when he is haunted by his own inner demons?  Oh, words cannot convey how unstable he seems.  It is terrifying really and I wish I knew what to do.  I love him as a friend, but I am completely confounded by him.  I do not understand him at all and that is a big handicap in trying to help a person.  All I can do is remain loyal to him and just be there for him when or if he needs me.  I intend to talk with him after he has had some sleep and tell him of some of these concerns of mine.  I owe him that much.  

Lastly there is the situation with Gem and Kakabel.  Gem misses Kakabel greatly even though he has not been gone for too long a time.  It has only been a week, but I suppose by other's measure of time that is a considerable amount of time?  I do not know.  All I know is that Kakabel is terrified right now after learning about his child that is on its way.  He has come so close to ascending and how he has this tossed his way.  After what happened the last time, I can understand why he would be quite upset.  I feel that there is more going on within him though than just that, but as of yet I do not know what that might be.  More investigation needs to be done and I think that I will begin with speaking with Carmine who has of late been Kakabel's sparring partner.

One final thought before I close this book and go on to see what I may learn from others.  I have not seen Mesteno in some time.  I hope he is doing well."

"event","Of late, I have not had the time nor the inclination to have written much of anything in this journal.  These past two weeks have been filled with a considerable amount of grief, work, and strife.  I do not even know where to begin, but I shall try to lay out the incidents as best I can.

Kakabel and Gem:  My brother is quite close to attaining his former state of grace.  He is well aware of this, yet he still is holding a bit of himself back for he has also found the love of a woman once more.  Gem is perfect for him in so many ways, is it any wonder that I worked on helping bring those two together?  For one thing she is unaging.  That means she can be with Kakabel for as long as they desire each other.  For another, she is adept in many forms of survival as well as possessed of the ability to weave reality into patterns as she sees fit.  That talent of hers is quite dangerous, and even forbidden in many other lands, but I can think of none better than she to wield it.  She has the wisdom not to abuse it, the intelligence to wield it well, and the foresight to consider the consequences of her actions.  It is those qualities of Gem (not her powers) that I think will be her greatest asset in the times that are yet to come.  

Suriel:  My brother has become involved in the issue between Kakabel and Gem.  It would appear that Kakabel is destined to die soon and perhaps Gem will go with him.  He is unhappy about carrying out this duty, and he has let more slip than he normally would.  He spoke with me for some time and we both wonder why bring Kakabel back from the ashes of his previous existence only to slay him?  And what will become of him when he is dead?  After this discussion, Suriel and I both think that this is the last and final act that Kakabel must perform for him to fully ascend.  The real question is, what of Gem?  I know that Gem has been quite unhappy with the circumstances so far, and I do wish that I was given leave to tell her more about what I know that will befall my brother.  However, some things as we all know must follow their own course.  It all comes down to faith.  I must have faith that it will all work out as it should for the greater good of all.

Another side note about Gem.  She is quite unhappy with me.  She has learned the full price of being an angel, which is the loss of one's true physicality.  She seems to mourn this, for Kakabel will no longer draw as many physical sensations as he does now.  Kakabel himself does not seem overly eager to part with that, and I do not blame him at all.  There is much about the physical world that I too miss and would love to experience once more.  However, I am grateful for the two things that I would miss the most I still have.  I can still enjoy food and drink if Ariana makes it or blesses it, and I can still feel physical closeness with Vadriel.  I have the best of both worlds, and I often wonder how this is even possible.  God's great mercy?  A test of some kind?  I do not know, and up till now I did not even question it.  I question it now, for I would like nothing more than to see to it that Kakabel receives the same gift.

Mesteno:  Oh, where to begin on this lost soul?  I met his violent side some time ago, and was even attacked.  While defending myself, I did what I could to provoke reactions as I wanted to learn all I could about this aspect of Mesteno.  It got a bit out of hand, and fortunately Tomas was there to assist me in subduing Mesteno before he brought further harm to himself.  He had reopened a wound of his and was losing more blood than he could afford to part with.  For one small moment, I forgot how fragile mortality actually is.  We took him to Vadriel's, who helped patch things back together.  Mesteno felt horrible about attacking me when he learned of it.  I do not blame him at all, I just wish I understood where he was coming from.  

Mesteno as far as I can tell has avoided alcohol, but still needs to remember to eat properly.  He has such a warped sense of survival, and I wish that there was something I could do to heal that.  I will forever be there to guide Mesteno, but I need to constantly remind myself that it is HE who will make the decisions about his fate, not I.  No matter how much I may wish for him to do as I say, I cannot force him, even if I know in the very core of my being that my way is far healthier than his.  That brings me to another thing that I must constantly remind myself of.  I do not know everything.  There is much about Mesteno, indeed the very world that I do not know of.  I may think that my way is the best way to follow, but only God knows for certain.  Once again this brings me back to faith.  I just have to keep my faith that in the end whatever Mesteno's fate will be, will be the one that is the best for him.  He is very dear to me and I should hate for anything horrible to happen to him.  He has suffered so much.  Moreso than any mortal should, I think.  His torment has cracked him even, but not broken him completely.  That says so much for his spirit.  I wonder what Mesteno would do if he knew what I felt about him?  How much I respect him and his friendship?  He would probably laugh and not believe it.

Vadriel:  A new development has unfolded during the time that Tomas and I took Mesteno to his house for medical attention.  It would seem that the subversive spirit that is known as David is not as bad as any of us thought.  Suriel himself got involved in this and did some investigations.  Both David and Vadriel have a connection to my fellow angel Vadriel (who the Vadriel I love takes his name from).  Unfortunately before he could reveal more, duty called Suriel and myself away.  It would seem that this is something that is not ready to be revealed yet.  To only further prove this, I have been quite unable to speak with either of my brothers on this and learn more.  

Tomas and Kameko:  Oh where to begin on these two?  I fear that I do not have much to tell aside from the expression of my feelings.  Tomas seems to be working hard on breaking the infernal contract that binds him.  He has even sought out the help of a mysterious lawyer who calls himself Lucky.  Many people make duck noises to this lawyer when they see him for reasons that are quite beyond my comprehension, but I digress.  It is likely some sort of inside joke that I would not understand even if it were explained to me piece by painstaking piece.  And on the topic of jokes, Tomas has yet to give up his quest to amuse me.  He has bestowed me with more nicknames than I ever thought possible.  I truly have to admire that one's creativity, but it does not amuse.  Rather it just gives me a sense of contentment these days for I have learned that it means that Tomas sees me as a friend.  I would love to laugh for Tomas, truly I would.  It seems so important to him that I do so, but I just cannot.  I do not think I know how to laugh.  I know I have laughed in the past, eleven times to be exact, so I know that it is possible.  I just do not know how I did it or why I did.  

I have very little to say about Kameko, aside from the fact that I feel that I have not done any good for her at all.  It should not be surprising, for she is a woman lacking in faith.  I do not know what has hardened her so, and I likely never will.  It is distressing to know that I cannot do anything for her and it is admittedly irritating to not know what has made her the way she is.  Perhaps Tomas can help her where I have failed.  Perhaps that is how things are meant to be.  I just have to hope for the best.  I know that Tomas feels for her, perhaps even loves her.  Once again this brings me to faith.  I must have faith that whatever will become of these two will be something wonderful.

Ra and Ophelia:  I have even less to say about these two.  They just seem quite perfect for each other in many ways.  They are both possessed of abrasive, forceful personalities and a strength of will that can amaze some of the most jaded of souls.  They both have similar interests in the world, and most important of all, they both seem to be quite fond of each other.  They also both have many issues, and I hope that this will not get in either of their ways.  I respect and cherish them both and wish for only the best.  

Amitiel:  Very little has changed with my tortured sister.  Uriel gave me a letter to deliver to her, which I did gladly.  For one small moment I saw her soften when she received it, but it was something so fleeting, that had I blinked I would have missed it.  I still have to wonder why our Father burned her and cast her down.  I have to wonder if Amitiel will ever return?  I think she will, but perhaps not for centuries yet.  She is moving, but at the speed of a glacier.  She is about as cold and as stubborn as ice too, I might add.  

Lastly Camael.  Why is he here?  He seems so unstable now after his fall.  Like any moment he is about to fly apart at the seams.  He is so fiercely trying to cling to what his ideal of joy is, that it is quite painful to watch.  I feel that beneath that core of joy he presents is a being that is tormented beyond many other's comprehension.  He wants love, I know.  He wants to be his own being, with his own will.  There is likely more to his drive than just this, but it is something that I have yet to discover.  All I know is that he makes me a bit uneasy.  Being in his presence is like being next to a volcano that seems serene on the surface, but any moment is going to blow with such fierceness that it shall strike down all in its wake.  I wonder if this feeling is valid?  I never took the time to get to know Camael very well, so there is much about him that is secret to me.  And now that he has fallen, I know him even less.  

So you see, even though I have not written in over two weeks, it does not mean that there has been nothing to report.  It just means that I have not had the time.  Now I must return to my duties back in the heavens.  Once I am finished there, I intend to return and look in on all those I care about and try to catch up as best as I can with what has been going on with them.  I just hope they forgive my sudden departure from this land, but I had much that I needed to attend to.  I will explain it if they ask, and I feel that they will understand.

I just hope that everyone is as well as they can be."

"event","Kakabel finally set his gaze upon the stars for the first time in centuries.  Gem and I were with him at the time, and it was a glorious sight to lay witness to my brother's joy at the sight.  With each passing moment he is growing to be more at peace with his nature I think.  I feel that he is so very close to ascending, that it is only a matter of time when Kakabel shall take up his mantle as the angel of the stars once more.  He has his love, and soon he shall have his nature back.  He shall be whole for the first time in what seems like forever. 

I am so very happy."

"event","I find that every now and then I despair over the human condition and wish with every fiber of my being that things could be different.  Mortal beings are so completely baffling to me in so many different ways, and yet I still have this driving need to see if I can somewhat make sense of it all.  Some days I am more successful than others.

Then there are nights like this where I just find myself lost.  I still do not quite grasp the concept of humor, as much as I would like to.  If I could just figure out this one thing, I feel that I would both be able to blend in so much better and be able to be of more help.  It is quite frustrating really, and luckily Ariana was about to give me some sort of emotional outlet before I burst.  She let me use her kitchen and knead some dough.

I have not made bread in centuries and I nearly forgot how it was done.  I used an old recipe that I remember observing many times in Greece during one of my mortal incarnations.  Gem assisted me in the kitchen and she was concerned that the bread would not be the most palatable in the world, and I too shared that feeling.  However, we were both pleasantly surprised when the bread turned out well.  Ariana plans to use it for the menu tonight in her inn.

I am glad that I was able to do at least one useful thing today.  I hate feeling useless, and I have been feeling that more times than I would like."

"event","I went on a walk in the woods with Gem this morning as the bustle of town was beginning to wear on my nerves and she sought some time to spend in my company.  She informed me that Matriel was of some help to her, as it was her suggestion that Gem speak with Faye about my brother.  It was about that point that Matriel herself decided to join us for whatever reason she saw fit in her mind to do so.  I really do need to warn Gem that we are attuned to our Celestial names and that the invocation of such has the ability to attract our attention if we happen to be paying attention to such things.  Matriel came, in the form of a little old lady as she is so fond of appearing these days and dressed in the most ridiculous of rain gear no less.  Gem seems rather fond of her, but I find Matriel trying to the senses.  She insists on bestowing everyone with the appellations of ""darling"" or ""dear"" among other things and she told Gem about the nickname that Ramiel came up with for me.  

Eventually Matriel took her leave of us, and shortly after that Kakabel came by to see Gem.  She gave him the box of cinnamon rolls that we had picked up earlier from Ariana's bakery and he seemed to enjoy them considerably.  Gem gave me more lessons in the art of thievery, this time with a puzzle box that I had to figure out how to open.  It was a most interesting challenge and after I managed to solve it, I was given a lockpick.  Gem then gave me a series of locks and instructed me in the art of opening them.  I find that this knowledge is quite interesting and I can think of so many uses for such a thing.  Eventually the time came for me to attend to duties so I took my leave, granting Gem and Kakabel some time to be with each other's company."

"event","Gem and I took a walk in the woods today as she wanted to talk to me about Kakabel and that was the perfect place to discuss such matters in peace.  She told me that she can hear his dreams and that they haunt her.  From what I learned it would seem that the link between Kakabel and Gem is growing steadily stronger with each passing day.  This does not surprise me for they are both falling in love with each other, if they have not already.  Gem sought out answers to a means to alleviate Kakabel's torment, but I could not give her any that were of any lasting value.  The only advice I had to offer was that Kakabel needs to fill his life with pleasant experiences so as to have a means to counterbalance all his pain.  After a bit of brainstorming we came up with the idea of a picnic for him.  Something peaceful where he can experience a few new sensations without getting too overwhelmed by them.  I remember how overwhelming it was to be in a mortal body and bombarded with all the senses that go with it that I could not begin to understand.  

Gem and I were soon joined by  She Who Tends The Dead as she had matters of importance to discuss with Gem.  As this was not any of my concern I moved away to grant them some privacy.  As fate or design would have it, Kakabel himself traveled to the very woods where we were, I think unconsciously following the link that binds him to Gem.  The moment he arrived, I did what I could to distract him as it would not have done for him to blunder into Gem's conversation with Faye.  He was most displeased to see me, especially since he knew that I was keeping something from him.  Eventually the time came when I felt it right to let him pass and see Gem, so I did.  He went to her like a moth to the flame.  At that point I faded completely as I felt that I was serving in a needless capacity and they did not desire my interference.  Gem and Kakabel spoke with each other about various issues and I watched.  I was soon joined by She Who Tends The Dead and she conversed with me on a different wavelength so as not to be overheard by Gem or Kakabel.  I discussed some of my feelings with her as I feel that as time passes my influence upon this land is drawing to a close.  She posed an interesting observation to me.  It may be true that they do not need me any more, but I seem to still need them.

With that thought in mind, I made my way back over to Gem and Kakabel and asked them plainly if they still wanted me around.  In their own way they assured me they did.  I was relieved to hear it and I gave my brother a gift.  A crystal tie pin.  Gem was given a gift as well, a butterfly hairpin.  Now they both have something to remember this moment by.  As for me, I have them both and I could not ask for anything more."

"event","I paid a visit to Carmine and Dris's today for if I am going to be one of the godfathers of Carmine's child, I feel that I should get to know them better.  We talked about how Kakabel needs to find more friends, and interestingly enough it was during that part of the conversation when Gem came by to visit as well.  If that is not a sign to me, I do not know what is.  I will do what I can to help nurture whatever sparks of friendship (and perhaps more) might develop between the two.  

Carmine gave me some advice on how to better deal with people.  He informed me that my gaze tends to be a bit intimidating and that my manner is far too stiff and serious.  I listened to what he had to say to me and I will consider his words.  I do not know if I will be able to change my behavior so as to better fit in with mortal society, but I will certainly try. 

And now I must stop writing for now as duty is calling me on to other things.  I will just leave this with one final thought.  Now that things are going well with Kakabel, I have to wonder what will next be done about Ramiel and Amitiel.  I have not forgotten about them, but I must be careful not to be too meddlesome.  Particularly with Amitiel.  I will just have to think on this."

"event","This evening I came to visit with Gem in one of her hiding places and we had a long conversation about many different things.  She asked me primarily about Kakabel and what sort of person I think him to be.  She told me that she does not have any regrets to the sacrifice that she gave him and would do it again if she were given the opportunity.  She finally admitted to me just how much she loves my brother.  I was so glad to hear that as I feel in my deepest heart that Kakabel feels the same for her.  They both need each other so very much.

As the evening progressed Gem shared some of her personal pain with me, and we discussed how she sees herself versus how the world sees her.  She told me other things as well, but those I feel are too deeply personal to write about here.  In the end, she wept and I took one of her tears and infused it with the property of how I see her soul so she too could see how I know her to be.  She seemed to be very touched with that act.  For this, I am glad.  I want her to know that she has beauty on the inside as well as the outside.  I treasure her friendship very much.

Later on into the evening, one of Gem's friends came calling on her.  It was none other than Shalandra, the girl who I had such violent thoughts for some time ago.  I was glad to see her for I was finally able to make amends to acting so poorly around her.  She forgave me, and now we can start anew with no bad blood between us.  For this, I am grateful.

And would you know it, but I learned a new game to play with cards?  I can divine with them (though I admit there are others far better at that art than I), but I never bothered to learn any games with them.  Gem taught Shalandra and myself how to play a game she called blackjack.  It is a remarkably simple game and is heavily dependent on the force of chance rather than strategy, though there is still some strategy involved.  It turns out that many use this game as a means of gaining material possessions, but one also has the risk of losing material possessions as well.  In essence that is what gambling turns out to be.  

I found it quite interesting and is worthy of more thought.  Many consider gambling to be a sin and now that I know more about what it truly is, I shall have to think as to why it can be bad.  Perhaps if Kakabel is in a good mood, I can ask him to explain this more for me.  Mesteno too might know something about this.  But for now, I think I shall just go see Vadriel and enjoy the pleasure of his company."

"event","Today I had quite the conversation with Kakabel in the Red Dragon Keep.  I had asked him if it would be easier on him if I simply left him be for I know that my presence must bring him pain.  He admitted that he would rather I stay in his life, and that is a thing that made me happy.  He did, however, ask me why I do linger on in this land when I am welcomed back to heaven.  I told him that I needed some time off to think about all that has happened tome since my fall as well as the fact that I have unfinished business here.  I have people here that need me and it would not do to abandon them like this.  I made a compromise with my Heavenly Father and told him that I would be willing to still perform certain duties if I could have just this one small time to myself.  A human's lifetime.  He agreed and let me have 75 years to largely do with as I will provided that I still do what I must, when I must.

Who knew that a time would ever come when I would be able to both have the courage to do so and the ability to actually reason with the Lord?  I still have much to do, and much to forgive and He knows this.  Kakabel feels that I have secret desires to stay here.  I admit that in a sense he is correct as I do enjoy my time here, though I would not want to give up being an angel.  It is too much a part of what I am.  It is worth the sacrifices I have had to make such as the loss of the taste of food and other things that go with being mortal.  Such as the simple way that they are able to perceive the world.  I have to wonder how my friends will react if they learn that I can see what their very soul looks like now?  How I no longer see things just by shape and light and color, but I can look into the very molecular fiber of a thing?  How I just do not hear what is spoken or actions that are taken, but how it effects the very symphony of Creation?

I admit though that there are things I do miss about being mortal.  One of them is the taste of food and drink.  The very act of eating itself.  I can still pretend, but it is not the same.  However, all is not lost in that department as I can still taste what Ariana herself makes for me.  It is a wonder that I still have that to experience, and for this I am grateful beyond words.  It is just awkward when I am in another place and someone offers me a bite of something to eat, and worse yet asks my opinion on it.  I have to go by my sense of smell to give them an answer unless it is someone I can truly trust would understand the bald truth.  

Ah, but back to Kakabel.  Gem later came to join us and it was quite plain to me just how much she cares for my brother, as if I did not already know.  What is interesting though is that Kakabel seems to return her feelings.  He is one that I cannot truly read, though I can largely speculate with what tiny clues I can gather together.  All I can say is that I do hope that things will work out well between the two.  They need each other like a man needs the very air to breathe.  They will become each other's salvation.  All I can do now is watch, hope, and to my best not to interfere and just let things develop as they will in a natural pace.

One final thing before I close my journal for now.  Kakabel still has a most remarkable eye for aesthetics.  Gem and I took him shopping as he was beginning to wear out that one outfit he had and so badly needed more clothes.  His sense of style is really quite remarkable, so much so that Matriel told me once that he should be given the Words of Fashion and Style should he ever come back.  I know she was joking as those are such superficial words, but even so it is oddly appropriate.  There is one thing that was made quite clear though.  I am not the only one in the heavens that wish to have Kakabel return someday.

That pleases me."

"event","Today was a day of watching pure foolishness in action.  It seems that there are a group of people running about the land with nothing better to do than to roam the countryside spouting off philosophies of hate.  In this case they wanted to persuade people to join their cause in scrubbing the land free of all races save the humans.  

Genocide.

I felt a wash of anger well up in me that was so fierce, it took all I had to avoid calling down the wrath of the heavens right then and there to smite those fools off of the planet and send their spirits hurtling down into the darkest pit that surely awaits them.  I have been through one holocaust as it is, I shall not suffer to sit by and watch another one unfold before my eyes.  As it was, I did not have to smite those people as they made the foolish mistake of attacking Ariana.  She naturally defended herself with all of her might, calling upon the very forces of nature to drive those people out of her inn.  I sat by and watched and did my part to help protect the people within from the careless hurtling of power on the part of those that would dare strike against Ariana.

And so the battle dragged on.  The Silver Moon Inn for a moment was a place of pure chaos.  Rats filled the place, called by Ariana to protect her.  The fiend (for how can I call such a man anything else) fighting her carelessly used telekinetic forces to try and disrupt the very molecular structure of the inn itself, all those within be damned.  When that failed, he tried to unweave Ariana herself, but naturally that was a course of action doomed to utter and complete failure.  How I would have loved to strip that one of all his power, for one can only gather that he should not have such, and leave him naked, bleeding, and raw.  I do not know what that man is, or how he became filled with such hate, but rest assured I will be carefully watching his every move.  If the Almighty gives me leave to strike, this is a duty that I will carry out gladly.  Until then my only consolation is that the creature is lacking in sufficient charisma to sway the teeming masses, and that the society he is trying to persuade is not wounded and vulnerable; thus open to the hand of any that might be able to build their lives to something better than what they have, no matter what the cost might be.

In the end, Ariana managed to drive the cancerous soul out of her inn along with his female sidekick who is so lacking in a will of her own I nearly pity her.  In fact, I pity them both.  One has to wonder how such a creature is made, how they lose touch of what is good and bad, and why they become filled with such fear and hate.  I suppose the most heartbreaking thing of all is the fact that I know these two are beyond any hope of my being able to redeem them.  If they are to be redeemed, it will take a force greater than I.

But enough.  I cannot write any more.  I am too filled with emotion at what is and what has to be.  I shall write more later, but now I must stop my musing and seek a way to simply let this all go."

"event","I feel the need to place down on parchment something so remarkable that were I not witness to it, I likely would not have believed it.  It all started with my wandering to the Red Dragon Inn to find Kakabel sitting there looking as terrible as can be.  My fears of his sanity had come to pass, and his grip on reality was being eroded away leaving nothing left but an empty shell of a being with naught but torment within.  I had no idea what to do, Kakabel was so far gone.  I just tried what I could to help him, moving mechanically through the motions as I was just as lost inside.  Gem came to the inn shortly after that and I let her take over as she seemed to have a better understanding as to what to do.  

Just as things were beginning to look beyond bleak, She Who Tends The Dead, more commonly known to all as Faye summoned me back to the forest where she and I first met to discuss Kakabel's possible redemption.  She bade me to bring Kakabel with me, along with Gem.  Mesteno too was chosen to come, though I do not know exactly why.  The only thing I can think of is so that he could learn that there is more to Kakabel than what his first assumption has colored his perception to be.  Perhaps it was so that Mesteno could finally forgive Kakabel.

When I was there within the fae circle, I found that I was forced to adopt my celestial form.  I remained hidden while I was like that for three reasons.  The primary reason was that seeing me as I was would do nothing but bring Kakabel pain.  The other was that I had fear that Gem and Mesteno would no longer treat me as they do.  It is one thing to hear that I am an angel, but a whole thing completely to actually see it.  The final reason is that Faye is forbidden to actually remain in my physical presence when I am in my celestial aspect.  It is the same for me.  If I encounter her in her fae form, I cannot appear in my celestial aspect if we are to have any contact with each other.  We would just simply repel each other into different folds of reality.

But I digress.  Back to the incident at hand.  Faye bade Gem and Mesteno to bring Kakabel before her.  She and Kakabel discussed several things, but primarily the cause of his own fall.  The death of Rebekah, his one true love.  The reason that she had to die, and the pain he felt inside when she did.  How he raged against the Lord that day.  I remember it still.
Kakabel grieved over his pain once more and it is as raw within him as it was when it first happened.  We listened, then Faye put him to sleep.

Mesteno having learned what he did began to question his own perceptions.  I led him away from the circle so that we could discuss things privately, and finally revealed myself as I was to him.  To my relief, he could still get beyond his awe and treat me as he ever did.  We did not get to talk for very long for something happened back with Faye, Gem, and Kakabel that is so colored with destiny altering significance that it was overwhelming.  Gem had let out such a scream back there, and I felt her make some choice.  A choice that I intend to learn the details of.

All I know is that Kakabel has changed somehow.  So too has Gem.  In fact, I think all of us that were there changed in some way.  It just remains to be see how and why."

"event","Forgive me if this note is terribly short, but I do not have the energy at the moment to put this in any lengthy terms.

For the past week I was in Hell.  Literally.  The Morningstar it would seem objected to my trying to redeem Kakabel and in turn sought to corrupt me as a means of striking back.

He failed.

It would seem that I have the most remarkable friends to risked everything to save me.  It would seem that the Lord Himself has forgiven me and wants me to come back.  I know this for when I was in Hell, I felt it happen.  The restoration of my wings, though they kept getting torn off.  Over....and over.  But each time they were returned.

There was no end to the pain.  Kakabel's wings are gone.  They were stolen from him, but unlike me, they were not returned.  Kakabel has been made mortal.  I suppose now his path to redemption can truly begin.  My job is over.  I feel numb to it all.

Faye's ring she gave me will let me sleep.  So this I will do.  I hear her song play in my mind, so I will just close my eyes and dream.

And forget everything."

"event","I feel like I am in Hell.  Kakabel saw me today after I had gone to the Red Dragon Inn in order to wash the blood from my body and sort through what I have just learned about myself and existence.  He took one look at me and grimly set to work cleaning my wounds.  Then in a voice as cold as death he wanted to know how my wounds came to be.

I think he already knew.  I told him and one by one the stars in his eyes went out.  He took his cigarette and burned me.  He could not understand why I had to know pain.  He does not know that I have to understand the hell that everyone else has.  After he burned me, he hit me, and then he dismissed me.

I left.  I wonder if I should have left him, but I could not see the sense in staying.  I decided to go to the one place where few can follow me.  I went to Limbo.  Ra was there looking over books in order to give him some inspiration as to what he wishes his tattoos to look like.  He has already decided to take on enough body piercings so as to resemble a living pincushion.

Ra and I talked about how angry we are with God.  Why we fell from grace and if we will ever return to our former states of glory.  Both of us agree that is something that is possible, just not very probable.  Ra's new cat also joined us, having found her way to Limbo at last.  Raincloud (the name Ra chose for his cat) seems to be a very clever cat.  I hope she brings Ra some happiness.  None of us are really happy, though some of us hide that well.  Ra best of all.

Now that I am in a place of nothingness, I think I shall retire to the room that Ehz lets me use and sort things out.  I have much to consider before I can face the world again.

I have never felt so exhausted in my existence.  
Lord, I wish I could just sleep.  
Please, please just let me sleep."

"event","I have mentioned in an earlier entry that the feeling of restlessness that has been raging within my system is due to anger, but it was not until this day that I was finally able to admit to myself the reason behind such feelings.

I am angry at my heavenly father.  It sounds so bland when I read those words on paper, but there it is.  I am angry.  So, very, very angry.  Why do things have to be as they are?  What was the reasoning behind the crusades, the inquisition, the holocaust, the black death, jihad, the last sacrifice of your own child?  Why?  I want to stand out and scream to the heavens, why, why, why?!

Why was Kakabel struck down for wanting love?  Why was it so terrible that he allowed himself to love any other than your arrogant and selfish being?  Why did Ramiel have to exist to simply sing your endless praises without a mind of his own?  What did Amitiel do that was so very terrible that even to this day she is but a bitter husk of a creature?  You burned her, Father.  You burned the very love right out of her.  Is there anything left for her?  And me.  Why did you not warn me that creating the djinn would be such a tragic mistake?  Why did you allow me to do such a thing?  

So much death.  So much blood on my hands.  I can never go back to heaven.  How can I go back when I feel such anger?  Such sorrow?  How can I serve one that I have no desire to serve?  Vadriel is wrong.  I can never go back to heaven.  There is no place for me there.  I can be replaced.  Saturn is still there, the stars still move, the truth is still told, and thunder is still heard.  Are we even really needed anymore?  

There are people out there that no longer believe in angels, in God, or in that which cannot be seen.  Faith is slowly being drained away from existence, in some worlds faster than others.  Why?  What will become of me when I am no longer believed in?  What will become of me when I am no longer allowed to live?  Will I die and go to hell?  Will I become a demon like Kakabel seems to think?  Will I simply cease to be?  Why else do you think that I try, and try, and try so hard to make some final mark on this land?  If it is my fate to wither into nothingness and forever be gone, I want to go knowing that I have done some actual good in the world.

I hurt myself today.  I confessed my fears to Mikhail in his torture room along with Mesteno as witness.  I cut my flesh till it bled as I allowed myself to unlock these feelings I have kept locked away for so many countless years within the prison of my mind.  Feelings so deeply buried that I could not even see them myself.  

I think I now know why people inflict pain on themselves.  Pain seems to be a way to let you know that you still exist.  It is a way to punish yourself for your sins.  A way to express your own inner drives.  It can be erotic, dangerous, and self destructive.  It can consume you.  I had to learn this.  

A harsh and bitter lesson.  Now that I am armed with knowledge, I have two paths spread before me.  One is the easy road where I can just fall into the seductive grip of pain and let myself drown within it so that I can no longer focus on all that is wrong within me.  Where inflicting pains of the flesh becomes the only way I know to release the pain of the soul I feel so bitterly inside.

Then there is the hard way.  This is the path where I confront the pains of my soul and lay them bare for all to see and hope to rise above them.  Where I seek to repent for my wrongs and put them to right.  Where I forgive myself, others, and even God.  One where I must face the fact that I might become undone.

Oh well.  Since when have I ever done anything the easy way?  I just hope I have the strength.  That is all I have these days.  Hope, determination, friendship, and love.  May it be enough. 

Oh, God may it be enough."

"event","Oh great and uncaring Father, what have I done?  I nearly lost my life at the hands of Kakabel for I dared to confront him with my knowledge.  I do not know what possessed me to toss out everything I knew about patience and subtlety out the door and be so direct!  While I was at it, why did I just not take an anvil and give Kakabel a few good clocks on the head?  I suppose in some foolish way, I was seeking to get his mental state to shift gears and attend to my actions.

Suffice it to say, it worked.  It worked a little too well.  One by one the stars in his eyes went out until there was nothing left but the pure emptiness of rage.  Pure, unfiltered rage that I feared if not watched would spill over and do great harm.  That is why I followed Kakabel out the door when reason was screaming in my mind just to let him be.  Gem, who was witness to this decided to follow me as well as I supposed she feared I would do something foolish.  

Gem got hurt.  Kakabel struck out at her, though I can tell that he actually felt some remorse for doing so.  He was at a most delicate stage of emotional being at that moment, and I can safely say I have never been so frightened in all my life.  Fortunately Gem knew that she was intruding on something extremely personal and was way over her head.  I am grateful that she came though for her presence seemed to have caused Kakabel's mind to shift gears from a hot, murderous rage to something quite unknown to me.  He insisted that Gem and I hold each other, though I cannot say why.  I think he did something when he made us do this, for the regenerative power I have within myself actually spilled over to include her and heal her wounds as well as my own.  I have not been able to heal anyone else since I fell.  All I know is that I do not think this was something I did.  Kakabel healed Gem through me.  After this was done, Gem left.

After Gem had gone, Kakabel confessed a few things to me.  Things so personal to his nature that I am not going to describe them here.  Suffice it to say, I was right in stating that he is a creature of sorrow.  He commanded me not to help him for he thinks that he is beyond all hope.  Perhaps he is, but that does not mean I will not try.  After all, only one who attempts the absurd can achieve the impossible.

I am not going to give up on you Kakabel, no matter how much you may wish me to.  You have given up on yourself, but I have not.  I will not give up on you even if this means you will hate me forever.  I would do the same for any friend.  I suppose this makes me a fool, but I would rather be undone trying to do good than to sit and play by the rules while all those I love fall into ruin.  I will no longer sit idle and watch, even if this means my uncaring Father will hate me forever.  That, and that alone is how it is going to be.  Nothing save my own annihilation is going to change it.

So mote it be."

"event","Today I received a visit from Faye who insisted that I go out and take a walk with her as I most obviously had much on my mind and somehow knew what was weighing me down was of an extremely personal nature.  As she was quite correct in the assumption that I could do with wise council, I agreed and allowed her to lead me to a very secluded forest where the both of us could converse in peace.

We talked about many things ranging from the meaning of the multiverse, to the Great Balance, to Vadriel and his welfare, to why Kakabel is the way he is.  Faye knew why Kakabel fell, and she decided that the time to come for me to know the details of this had arrived.  I was very grateful to her for telling me, for only if I truly know what is behind a person's distress can I be of any assistance.  It helps to know where the other person is coming from.

Poor Kakabel.  I was right in pitying him for his fall was due to his loving of a mortal woman and knowing her in a most intimate way.  That act is completely forbidden for we are to love none other than God, nor are we to ever allow ourselves to have our own will.  You see, as angels we are but messengers.  The hands and feet of God.  Avatars of His will, and nothing more.  

At least that is how it is supposed to be.  But nothing in existence ever works as it should.  Kakabel lost his love for she was taken from him.  The fate of his nephalim unknown, and he thrown down into the Pits of Hell and made demon.  Kakabel can never see his love, his children, or his Stars ever again.  He is now chained by the tethers of anger and hate that he unwittingly wove when Lucifer came to claim him.  Kakabel is more alone than anyone should ever have to be.  I am not going to leave him like this.  Faye gave me the knowledge I need to help Kakabel break the chains that bind him to Lucifer and set himself free.  You see, Kakabel gave me the means to be entirely free and I intend to return the favor. 

Kakabel, I shall help you gain your freedom, this I so swear.  I shall help show you the path to your redemption and pray that you take it.  I shall be the best friend I know how to be.  In the end, that is all I can do.  I may not be an angel anymore, but I can still forever be a friend.  Nothing save my own foolishness can ever take that away.  Faye helped me see this and she decided to gift me with an emerald ring.  She did not tell me why she saw fit to bestow such a thing onto me, but perhaps it is to serve as a reminder of the strength of friendship.  I shall see it as such.  The ring she gave is no minor item and it is quite enchanted.  She also revealed herself to me in her truest of forms.  I think that this along with the ring was also her way of telling me that she knows I am a friend to herself and that she considers herself to be a friend to me.  There are no words to express the gratitude I feel for her, so I shall not attempt to do so. 

Helping Kakabel is going to be a very long and exhausting road.  May I find the strength within to keep on this task and never fail.  I must not fail.  I cannot fail.  

I will not fail."

"event","This was a day filled with surprises and strange revelations.  It all started out when Vadriel had woken and found that I had stayed behind to watch over him through the entire night.  He insisted that I go out and get some air, which I reluctantly agreed to do.  I suppose the man wishes some time alone, something that I understand completely, even if I would far prefer to be at his side.

I left his house without bothering to change clothes or clean up.  I was wearing a simple peasant's outfit as it is something I find comfortable for simply lounging about a house in and did not bother to do a thing with my hair other than to simply bind it back so it would be out of my way.  I normally take more care with my appearance than this as I like to make a good impression on those I encounter.  Not this time.  This time I just wanted to make sure that Vadriel would be all right, but....oh well.  For lack of anything else to do, I made my way over to the Medevial Tavern.

It was mere moments after I had arrived when Mesteno himself showed up wearing only a long shirt.  His pants, as he explained, were still in the jaws of a rather fearsome dog back at the Estate.  I did not ask what he was doing to cause the dog to be agatated to the degree of wanting to bite him.  Mikhail soon joined us and when he saw the sorry state of Mesteno and my clothing, he insisted on taking us to see his tailor and rectify the situation.  Mesteno and I readily agreed to oblige him, especially as it would seem that Mikhail is going to pay for all of this.

Mesteno and I were shown into the tailors and each of us were gifted with an outfit hand selected by Mikhail himself.  The man spared no expense, seeing that we had the proper footwear and accessories to go with this.  I am now the owner of a sheer shirt made out of the most remarkable fabric that at first seems to be black, but when you turn it just so in the light, it shimmers either with an emerald green or silver.  I have a pair of black leather pants to go with it, boots, and bracers.  I think that this outfit would do so much more for Vadriel than the loincloth, and after I had received it, I wanted to show him at once.  I thanked Mikhail for the gift and went on my way.  I made a stop along the way though and decided on a whim to get my ears pierced.  I cannot say for certain why I had such a thing done, but at the time it seemed like the right thing to do.  I have to wonder though with my rate of healing, if I take the earrings out will the piercings just close over and my ears become whole again?  I do hope not, for it will be most annoying to have to constantly repierce my ears if I choose to wear earrings.

Eventually, I returned to Vadriel and he was indeed quite amazed at the clothing.  I suppose I look sexually appealing for that is the kind of look he gave when he saw me.  I shall have to remember to tell Mikhail that he chose the right outfit for me when I next see him.  We were outside conversing when Kakabel himself chose to suddenly pay us a visit.  Amazingly, he did not come here to mock but seemed in a rather pensive mood.  He kept to the shadows as the light actually pains him.  The longer I am with Kakabel, the more apparent it is to me that under the smug, well dressed figure is a very sad and tragic being.  Kakabel would be quite disgusted to know that he has my pity, but nevertheless it is there.  

I just wish that I knew of a way to help him.  He is after all, my friend."

"event","Mesteno had given me some alarming news about Vadriel earlier this day.  It seems that the subversive spirit known as David has decided to torment Vadriel with some facts about his past and the truth of his nature.  I knew instantly that something was terribly wrong and dashed over to Vadriel's place as fast as my feet could carry me.  It is a good thing I did not waste any time for when I arrived, I found him outside, half dressed with a huge bonfire roaring.  He was weeping and raging as he tossed old records and the like into the fire.  

I have never seen him so upset.  It seems that Vadriel has been told that his existence is a lie and that it properly belongs to this David.  As proof, David's name is on the birth certificate of Vadriel's parents but for some unknown reason, it was hidden and a new one that had Vadriel's name upon it was made.  I do not know the truth of what is going on, and I told Vadriel that this is a mystery that needs to be solved.  Fortunately he agrees with me.  I intend to assist him in every way possible.

For now, I am just glad that I arrived in time to be of some use and some comfort to him.  This David had best beware from now on for I shall not suffer to see my friends, especially my loved ones to be treated so shabbily!    
And that is my final statement for today."

"event","I paid a visit to Mikhail today after I managed to actually find the place that he hides himself.  His lair is quite remote, and knowing what little I know of him, this is not the least bit surprising to me.  It turns out to be a crypt filled with all manner of dangerous spirits.  I pity the poor fool that will intrude upon this place when Mikhail does not welcome their presence.  They shall not last for very long.  

Mikhail's crypt (for I honestly cannot call it anything else) quite obviously is not one to get many visitors, and has not in quite some time.  Oddly, today seems to have fated for Mikhail to get a wide assortment of visitors for it was not long after I arrived when the people just started coming.  Neither of us can begin to fathom why.  He drove most of the intruders away by unleashing his guards.  Two managed to slip through, both of them female.  One was content just to remain hidden in the shadows and watch us, while the other actually engaged in conversation.  In fact, come to think of it, the other intruders that were driven away had a female sense about them as well.  Odd that.  

In spite of the fact that Mikhail's home suddenly was suffering invasion of the females, we had a pleasant visit.  He showed me pictures of his family and told me a little bit about his personal history.  I think he would have told me more, but the women just kept coming and he had to deal with them.  Sadly, I was unable to stay as I had duties back at the Corner Bar to attend to.  Ah well, with time and proper circumstance perhaps I shall learn more about Mikhail.  Until that time, I shall just have to ponder the strangeness of our friendship.  An ex-angel and an elder vampire lord (at very least I suppose that is what he is) friends?  Who knew such a thing would have been possible?  Yet there it is.  Just goes to show one that existence is infinitely more complex than one would think."

"event","I only have two things to report today.  Firstly I do not think I will ever understand why people find the need to scream and holler inside public places when others are trying to relax and enjoy their drink as a certain Scotsman did in the Silver Moon Inn.  Secondly, Ivory has given birth to her babies.  They are not doing well at all as they came too early.  I fear the worst, but will hope for the best.

After all, what else can I do?"

"event","The strangest things happened in the tavern today.  I should have known when I walked in and found Bess actually asleep that this was going to be an odd day.  Bess is a strange creature that always seems to be working the bar no matter what time of day it happens to be, and never seems to ever sleep.  I do not think she has a life outside of the bar and often wonder if she is a real person at all, or some manifestation of a bartender's ghost or other sort of undead that is anchored to that place.  If that were true, it would explain a considerable amount.

The second strange thing that occurred is that some sort of elven being came into the tavern dressed only in a loincloth.  Mesteno was witness to this and he made the suggestion that I appear before Vadriel dressed as such.  I actually will consider doing that as it will be something to surprise him with.  I surprised him a great deal some time ago when I dressed in Mesteno's clothes for him and I think I should like to do it again.  As time wore on, I engaged in conversation with the elf, who as it turns out is a druid that worships some sort of pagan nature goddess.  He grew a suit of armor about himself out from the tavern's wood and tried to impress me with the powers that his goddess gave him.  He conjured fruit on the table and other such acts.  I think it disappointed him when I was not impressed to be witness to such miracles.  He told me that I too could perform these wonders if I converted to the worship of his goddess.  I just had to laugh after I got over my initial surprise at the offer.  I could not believe he actually would ask me to do such a thing!  Me!  A former angel of God, turning myself to another?  A pagan goddess of all things?  I really do not care to be Undone, thank you very much.  Needless to say, I politely declined his offer.

I still cannot believe I was even asked such a thing."

"event","Kakabel is displeased with me.  What else is new in the world?  He came into the inn today in a strangely subdued mood.  I do not know what tempest rages within that one's head, but I do intend to find out.  I will have you know, once I set my mind to something, there is nothing in all Creation, save for perhaps the Creator that can stop me.  

Vadriel was with me today.  We were spending time enjoying each other's company when Ivory came into the tavern.  She was obviously in distress and was in the throes of labor.  That was not at all good, for her babies are not ready to be born just yet.  Fortunately, Vadriel was there to give her medical attention and use his healing gifts.  I helped in the only way I knew how by singing to her.  My voice is nothing compared to Ra's, but it still has its own puissance to it.  I think I was able to help soothe her as well as her unborn children.  Vadriel managed to quell the labor for now.

After things had calmed down, Ivory was feeling completely lost and alone.  She has lost so much in her time, and she is such a gentle soul, it pains me to see her suffer as she is.  She knows what I was and that seemed to have granted her the courage to actually ask if she could share her consciousness with mine and I with hers.  I allowed this.  I wanted to let in Vadriel as well, but for some strange reason, I could not.  It was as though there was a wall there that Vadriel himself is unaware of.  He seemed a bit bothered by that, but did not want to dwell on it too much so I let the topic go.  At least for now.  I intend to bring it back up when the timing is just right.  I do not want to push him, but this is something that has got my curiosity going.  Vadriel, ever the mystery to me, to others, even to himself.  Perhaps someday this is a mystery that will be solved.  Perhaps it never will be.  Whatever the case, I shall always be by his side for as long as he will have me.  This I so swear upon all that I am and all that I will be.  
Forever and amen."

"event","Today was another typical day in the tavern.  Women in ill fitting clothing were actively hunting down any male that would deign to take notice of them in hopes of securing a mate for the night.  Men were striding in sweeping their gaze over the inn's patrons in hopes of picking a fight for the mere pleasure of doing so, while all the rest just sat and droned on about humdrum occurrences that occur in their boring lives.  It as all irritatingly stereotypical, I was almost ashamed to even be witness to such.

I had no patience for this.  I was just about to leave when Mesteno arrived at the tavern to relax and drink some of his beloved Grand Mariner.  He knew straight off that I was in a most disagreeable mood and being the curious sort that he is, sought to discover why.  At first I was quite unable to answer his question as I have been seeking the answer to what is wrong with me for days without any success.  Mesteno, however, is a rather clever man in his own fashion in spite of the appellation of ""dolt"" that Vadriel has bestowed on him.  He was most persistent in his questioning of me and correctly discerned that I have been experiencing violent tendencies of late.  He explained that such emotions are a normal thing for humans to feel.  Anger is part of the human package and it is how one deals with the emotion that is what decides if a person is good or bad, not the act of having the emotion alone.  I drew some small relief from this, though it still disturbs me that I should feel such a thing at all.  What is worse, it is this anger, this rage, this wrath, that has been with me for quite some time and not just as a mortal.  I have had this emotion even as an angel and it is this along with my own greed for knowledge and lust for companionship that drove me to fall.  It is so easy to blame Kakabel for my sins, but the truth of the matter it is something that lies deeper within the innermost core of my being.

I do not care for this fact.  It is quite the bitter pill to swallow.  I am a poor angel.  It is no wonder that I am no longer a part of the heavens, but am now consigned to walk the earth.  Vadriel has faith that one day I shall redeem myself and return to my previous state of grace.  Kakabel seems convinced that I am sliding deeper into sin and soon I shall be feeling the cracking whip of the Lightbearer.  Others merely do not know what to make of me.  They think I am either a strange and rather naive young man or that I am as some have put it, ""creepy.""  What do I make of myself?  I honestly do not know.  I think that there is a bit of truth to be gleaned from all of the aforementioned opinions, but in the end only the Creator knows for certain.  I just wish He would let me in on it."

"event","I honestly do not know why I bother with either the Red Dragon Inn or the Medieval tavern anymore these days.  The Red Dragon Inn has become a regular dive ever since they let the former staff go, and the unsleeping Bess at the Medieval tavern can never seem to serve me the correct drink no matter how much I try to persuade her to do otherwise.  I have tried everything from patiently explaining to her that I do not care for ale, to asking that she exchange the drink for something more palatable, to getting annoyed, to just simply moving behind the bar and serving what I wish to drink myself.  I have even been forced to readjust the molecules of a beverage to turn it into something else on occasion.  I do not care for doing such a thing, as for one it is a bit on the flashy side, and for another it wears me out.  Such a task used to be quite simple, but it would seem that my abilities are now quite limited in scale.

Today was such a day where I just was too tired to argue with Bess, so I turned the drink to something else.  This is quite the complicated task and due to the various distractions that were about in the form of noise level I messed up and made my ale turn into some strange green liquor that I later learned was called absinthe.  I have heard stories about this drink and did not want it and neither did Mesteno.  A carpenter by the name of Gage was more than willing to take it off my hands and he along with Mikhail enjoyed it.  In fact they enjoyed it so much that they became quite physically friendly with each other's company.  This seemed to frustrate Mesteno very much.  I suppose it is due to the fact that Sally is too ill to provide any sort of physical pleasure at the present.  Getting shot in the chest can do that to a person.  Is it any wonder why I call that one the ""King of Pain""?  He seems to attract pain to himself like a magnet.  

Ah, but the time has come for me to cease writing for now and work on various projects that have been presented for me.  If anything, I can never complain about having nothing to do."

"event","I am so completely annoyed I do not think I can even find the words!  Something is definitely wrong with me, I just do not know what it is.  I feel so restless, so on edge, I cannot stand it.  I find that I just want to lash out and hurt someone or something.  How wrong is that?  What is wrong with me?!  I went to the keep to try and see if I could find some books that might give me some clues as to what might be going on within myself when I saw Mer working on some sort of computer for a man named Royce that she is quite fond of.  She knew right away that there is something wrong with me and invited me to talk with her to see if we could both figure it out.  Unfortunately we did not get too far when some elven lady by the name of Shalandra came into the keep.  I know that this is a public place, but it felt like an invasion.  It was such a strain to remain civil to her and resist the temptation to just toss her down the stairs so I could continue my conversation with Mer.

But somehow I did resist and managed to put on a show of civility.  The woman seems to be a childhood friend of Gem's and asked me a considerable about of questions about her.  I answered them to the best of my ability, and then she seemed to want to talk about fluffy things like the weather and her horse.  It was so frustrating and so boring!  I had to tell myself over and over that the woman does not mean anyone harm and she just had the misfortune to catch me at a very bad state of being.  Perhaps one day when I shake this strange feeling, I can give her a second chance, but as it stands I would be better off simply divorcing myself from any so called pleasantries.  And this Shalandra is all about pleasantries.

Mer worked quietly on the computer while I talked with Shalandra about inane things and thought of ways to get rid of her, each more horrible than the last.  Why am I thinking such things?  I should not be, this is so very wrong!  I was quickly reaching the end of my rope and was about to lash out irrationally and choke the very wind out of her lungs when some force of time took pity on me and she had to leave due to an engagement of hers.  Thank you God for your intervention if that is the case, for I do not know what I would have done.  Would you not know it though?  The moment she left, Mer had other business as well and had to leave.

So now I was left alone in the keep.  I could not control myself.  I just ran about the place, grabbing books and throwing them off the shelves, creating quite the mess.  When that was not enough I took chairs and such and tossed them about.  I am just very fortunate that nothing was broken or damaged.  This irrational action seemed to quell the raging tide of my inner being for at least a little while, but I know it did not banish it for good.  I cleaned everything up and put everything back, then left before anyone could come and talk to me.  I am now in Limbo and seriously considering staying here for good.  I am too unstable right now to be traveling about.  I just wish I knew what was wrong with me!"

"event","Today was a strange day.  It began when I came into the Red Dragon Inn to sort out these odd feelings of restlessness I have been feeling ever since Kakabel came to this land, and just sit with a drink in contemplation while watching the people go about their lives.  No sooner had I arrived when I met up with Geoff, the head of the Syndicate.  He too seemed quite weary about one thing or another and was seeking release from his own inner demons, if I am any judge of the man.  He had brought with him a drug that is known by an incredible assortment of names, but it is most commonly known as marijuana.  He offered some to me, and since I was in the mood to try something new, I accepted.  It did not have much of an effect on me other than to make me feel oddly lightheaded.  I suppose you can say it was relaxing in its own way, and I now understand why people seek to smoke this stuff.  However, I do not think that this is something I am going to do again.

As time progressed, Mer came by to grab some coffee and visit with Geoff and myself for a time.  She seemed a bit surprised and rather amused to find that I was actually getting as she called it ""stoned.""  I honestly do not know what the conversation was about as it did not hold my interest and by then my mind was simply drifting.  Eventually Kakabel came into the inn and was instantly aware it seems of the fact that I was under the influence of a drug.  He appeared quite disgusted with me as though he were a disapproving father who has just encountered his errant son misbehaving.  He told me I was better than this and that I am tainting myself more and more with sin.  I honestly do not know why he seems so concerned with my spiritual welfare, and I really wish he would not tell me things that I already know.  I know that I am not perfectly holy and virtuous.  Must he rub that fact in and throw it in my face?  What is he trying to do, make me feel worse about myself?  Suffice it to say, I was completely irritated at that point and chose to make my exit to the one place I know he will not follow me.  That is Limbo.  It is here where I am writing this with only Cut and Paste, Ehz's two cats to keep me company.  Paste seems to be pregnant with kittens and is in her own state of grumpiness.  Cut is peevish as well for Paste is being rather temperamental.  Ehz and Ra are out, and I have no idea where they might be.

No matter, it is probably best that I stay by myself until I completely purge the drugs out of my system.  I just wish I knew what is wrong with me, and why Kakabel is acting so strange."

"event","It would seem that Mesteno is making an attempt to reinvent himself.  He showed up at the medieval tavern today wearing a syndicate uniform that he modified with several belts and such to make it more his style.  What is more interesting is that not only has he officially joined the Syndicate (a fact which I am pleased to hear about), but he has chopped his hair off with what must have been a knife.  It looks utterly dreadful, but he wants to leave it in that state as a sort of reminder of his own decision, I suppose.  He told me that he had some ""business"" to take care of Mesteno asked me to give his love to Sally before departing, something that I willingly agreed to do.  I knew right then that he likely plans on doing away with his pimp.  And do you know what?  If that is the case, more power to Mesteno.  I am pleased to see that he is going to break away from that part of his life, even if it means the death of a man.  The man is vile anyway.  So Mesteno, wherever you might be, know that I wish you well."

Review

With a mediocre '80s TV show about two good ole Southern boys, an orange car with a Confederate flag on top of it and some pretty short shorts as its inspiration, I hope you aren't expecting too much from this big-screen version. If you are, you'll be disappointed. Whooowheeee! The Dukes of Hazzard is one dumb movie.

"event","Ok im gonna start with this year 9to date) and work my way back as far as I can, listing out 1-2 songs that sums the year up in relation to my life.

2003~ ""not the girl"" rachel farris, ""feel good"" system of a down and kitty
2002~ ""survivor"" destiny child
2001~ ""you otta know"" alanis moreset ""graduation"" vitamin c
2000~""running down a dream"" tom petty, 
1999~ ""dream"" cranberries
1998~""happy boys happy girls"" aqua, 
1997~ ""anthem"" blink 182

went through all my highschool/jr high pictures adn hfolders. im not going to attempt the letters now. I did this with vitamin c's song on repeat. Im like sooo sad. sooo much has changed. half the peopel I dont talk to due to them cutting ties, or me cutting ties. I have a notepad bran agve me jr year. I had all sorts of people sign, describe themselfs, first impression of me, now impression, and more about them. I saw referanses to my fashion design career, my highschool sweet heart, people who call me friend, yet i dont talk to. people I call friend and they dont talk to me. 

did anyone follow their ""dreams""? there was this one day in 10th grade... the lunch table I sat at was like teh ""UN"" of social ciclres, we had the prep, goth, hick, wiger, dork, nerd, shy, ghetto.... anyways, one day we worked all our plans and dreams togthor so we would alwasy be togthor... lol we knew then it wouldnt happen, but I still recall that day.

seesm alot of the girls got pregnant/married. the guys went military. some moved to out of state collages, others died. 

I recall the sensation I had, walking in the hallways, headset blaring over my ear, small talk to people in teh halls. gossip at the lockers, tehn teh ladysroom. showing up in class jsut in time or a few min late. I felt surreal, yet right. 

looking back i see things diffrently. I lok at my pics then and I see how pretty was 9ok still am but i was soooo pretty in highschool) yet I didnt believe so then. I let many oppertunities slip by. 

the dreams I ahd then, are what I dont want now. 

the firends I had tehm, all but a couple are gone from my life. 

ok ok enough on that trail of thought."

I had a dream where I forgot all but the last hour of it or so, pretty much I was setting the table for my mother, and then we had dinner (with someone else though I forget who) and then I was clearing the table. She was old, but not that old. Older is the best way to put it. I asked her if she rememebr the last tiem she had dinner with her family growing up. we started to talk about her brother, and in the dream he was like 80. I never met him. we talk on the phone, and corresponded, but we never met. 

the dream it self was depressing cause it was about things ending. time going. im loseing."

"event","so HR called me todaya dn FINNALLY told me what my raise is... 4%, so rought $20-40 extra dollars on teh pay stub.

speaking of work im about to find myself in some MAJOR drama... and unwillingly too.

see emily was suppose to get the postion I have now, beofore me... they told her she had to be on loan for 90 days then she has it. 60 days into it and Im offer the same thing. less then a month into it im offered the job. there were two postings... one for a rep who moved 2 levels up (thats the one emily posted for) and the otehr was promted to a diffrent department (the one i posted for) the one who went 2 levels up had to do the 90 day loan, which means technically the position emily and I both were on laon for wouldnt be free till he was posted into his new job, while the other rep, the one i was replaceing was already free. result? i got the job before her, even though she was there longer then me. I havnt told anyone other then kristeen about this promotion cause of that fact.

the drama thickens. we found out last week that 2 people will be moved back one level (not a demotion in pay) now logically you would think I would be one of these people sense im the newest, and this other girl who is still on loan who hasnt even posted for the job yet. but word on the street is it will be the girl just mentioned... and emily. even emily suspects this though shes doesnt know (for sure atleast) about me being offically in the department. 

I ask her today why she thought I wouldnt be one... she said cause I was skips favorite (the manager) ... shit >< so when all comes out, and if emily is the one who gets bump, with no pay raise, nothing, im going to look like an ass, like i brown noised my way into what should be her position! 

ohwell I didnt do anything like that.. I did my job, and I did it good.... I have alot of pressure on top of me. see I KNOW my manager pulled strings to get me this... without me asking, hinting or anything to sujest i wanted it. BUT hes on top of me, I have to keep my numbers with the rest if not above the rest (as i was in the job 2 levels down from mine now) or he has heat from his manager which comes down onto me.

fun stuff right? well this office im in has more politics in it then the white hosue im sure... adn as much as you try to avoid it, your sucked in."

I call her. no anwser. ok ok now what? i text her. nothing. try calling again, picks up and hangs up... shit! so I go back to the apartment... wet to the boan. a miss call! how in gods name did that happen. its her... shes lost >< but not for long..jsut when I was about to rush out and find her, she was right by my building... with an umbrella to boot. arg!

Rach call my house phone up and said she had an extra ticket to teh Jaguars firt home game... so I went to teh first football game EVER... andnit was the second game I watch period, ever ^_^ Actually had a blast ^_^ teh last quarter was kick ass... like I understood what was happening.... but Im not sure I could give an acurate replay ^^' at any rate we kick ass... final score 27/23 ^_^ I dont think it change... we left with like just over a min on the clock, and the ball was still ours....

ok yeah looks like I have another uneventful weekend. Tammy will be in daytona, and rach will be working and with her b/f. *sigh* I need to MOVE change.. do something. Maybe goto Tampa... tehy got a citibank sigh down there now. Other choices would be alberquercie (sp?) NM, and kansis city. God How i jsut want a empty my account (especially after todays check) grab a car, any car as long as it runs, pack a couple shirts, pair jeans, couple pairs undies... simlpe foord... and take off. just go. See where I end up when I have to stop. 

oooh! and if thing go well.. sean adn I will be room mates in a riverside apartment ^_^ He was casual talking about how he wanted to move out, but needs a room mate and his #1 choice was chris... but chris seems to never be ready. So im like... hell Ill be your room mate (save monies on rent ^_^) we talk about it... but i wasnt sure if he was seriosuly wanting to move... well last night he ask me if I was being serious.. and im like hell yeah! so when my lease is up Ill be packing ^_^

god I use to many of those stupid faces.

God it sucks.. do i not ahve ANY friends left in theis god forsaken place! And the ones that are my firends... there all stuck up there boy friends asses. Arg! Am I the only person alive that doesnt WANT a relationship? that the idea of being with somenoe constantly sickens me? I dont know... I guess im jsut fucked up. 

Speaking of being fucked up.. looks like i ruined another good friendship. well it use to be good. I dont know. One thing I have learned in the last 6 years.. people dont stick around. I think I might finnally harden myself enough to not be so freaking open with everyone. Im tired of investing trust and emotions into something thats just going to leave me.

"event","well after loseing a total of 14 lb and gaining 5 back on vacation, i have broken down and am saying screw the diet! Im going to jsut eat healthy.... i will still cut out unessisary sugars... heck ill even avoid pointless carbs... but im not going to deprive myself of food i want... ill jsut limit myself. besides im doing 40/50 min cardio 3 times a week, and i doo strengh training 5 days a week.... as long as i eat healthy and smart i wont gain... and I look good at the size im at anyways. I jsut need to firm and tone up, which is what im working on now ^_^

another thing im changing is my party habbits. after this last weekend, and thinking about previous weekends... I need to lighten up my drinking by alot... getting piss drunk once in awhile is ok, only when im with close friends though. mainly im going to stick to mix drinks and maults (instead of straight shots) no im not ashamed of anything I have done thus far... though im going to now make sure ill never do anything I may be ashamed of later.

Im really getting into love hina... alex gave me the first 2 mangas in the series... and its sooo fun! must buy more ^_^

working is doing good... busting my ass and its paying off. though I have to admit I HATE it when the slackers whine. it really irates me. thing is kristeen is a ""friend"" 9translation a person I talk to at work) and she is one of the whiners... one of her big gripes is that she nor anyone else from this managers team she was on last year got their annual rais... cause they didnt meet their numbers. shes saying 9along with everyone on the team0 that its not thier fault cause their manager sucked and didnt supply the info needed to know where they were on the matrix, or was there to ""manage"" them and not let them get away with everything. um excuse me? but hello! if you work, then youll meet your numbers.. thats that. you shouldnt need a manager to hold your hand and tell you not to talk off the phones 4 hours out of an 8 hour shift. and now that these people are on a managers team that DOES inform them of their numbers, and make sure they arnt fooling around, and yes micro manages 9which is bad but hey it could be worse) they are bitching about that too ><

im one out of maybe 5 people on the team that really like our manager... hes awsome! hes bussiness orinted... sees facts, and if you want him to see your point of view you have to present facts. i respect this. this is a kind of person that SHOULD manage a team. unfortantly though when people dont get their way, they bitch. also they forget the fact that he has people above him that are pulling his strings... not all the 'bs"" we are told to go through is his doing... but above him! erg corprate politics... i cant stand people who is in corprate america and dont get you have to play the game if you expect to get anywhere. take me for example... I dont kiss anyones ass... but my numbers are the best...well one of the best ^^' and im not micro managed (for the most part) the people whose numbers SUCk are micro manage, and yes he gets onto them.. cause he has heat over him about why those members of his team are sucking...

ok ok i need to stop ranitng.... but seeing how i never rant about my job.. or hell even talk about it im sure yall forgive me this time ^_^"

Bran was kinda freaked out about hat lol ^^""

room was bigger then I plan, and the grounds what I expected. food was wat over priced, though the fast food was better quality there then here. 

For my bday bran paid for the glass bottom boat tour. lots of fun. I was the only one who DIDNT see the shark *sigh*

well thursday night we got back to ft lauderdale, and room w/ alex and juan. Alex gave me the first 2 love hina mangas for my bday ^_^

well for one tonight bran and I leave for ft lauderdale where well be setting off on you new career as pirates! um yeah not really, but we are going to the Grand Bahama Island in celebration of my birthday this wensday ^_^

I bought a new digi cam from kodak on my sears card the other day. 4 mega pixiles ^_^ comes with 16 mg of internal memory, and I spent $100 to buy a 256 meg card. It rocks cause it also films and records audio. 

worked 20 hours of over time this week.. wow. most of it is going to teh sears card,hell probally all of it lol. thatll be 9/15. Also plan on giving alex the money for the tv/surround sound he said he would sell me... hope he still wants to sell it cause i want it! 

last night I hung out rach and tammy. Met up with sean david, victor, greek and christina. The bunch of us went to jeffs bday party, wich was pretty kick ass. 

oooh and I think the icon gives it away but I bleached my bangs ^_^ everyone says I look like rouge -_- I didnt do this to copy a look! lol ohwell.

Everything is packed and ready to go for the trip and AFO. got a check list and everything. Somehow i manage to only have 2 bags.... but I promise you in these 2 bags is enough clothes and shoed and assesories to last jsut over a week.

Im pretty excited about my work. the 25th was my first cycle date that I actually had time to work, and had a least help from the previous associate. I manage to collect or write off over 40% of the total balanses that potential could roll 4 months past due (which is bad) and we only have to save 40% to be on target. Not to mention my #s are rocking... the monthy goal is $664,000 total balanses PD# has to collect (pd3 is past due 3 months team) there was 22 productive days this month, I only had 10 and im at $148,000 wich is 22% of the goal and seeing I dont have the 22 days to colelct that much, nor do I have money comeing in from progams as of yet... this is a VERY good thing. 

random fun thig at work happen. this loser of a guy had a big balance ... $14k and for the alst 3 months he has not anwsered his phone or return or call (hense why i called him a loser) well I did a search on him through the software we have and couldnt find any new #s. soooooo i searched info to find his family members. found his dad and called him up, left a message on the anwser machine. Next day I get a call from the dad.. spent 15 min looking for the account and as I did that he was talking about how his son works for the gov and is in alot of secret stuff blah blah blah... and then he mentioned he tried calling his son and couldnt get ahold of him either. get the account up and the cardmemebr had called in after I left and paid his FULL payment (wich was in the thousands)... and I KNOW it was cause I had his daddy call him ^_^ yeah Im bad lol

ok erm that was alot of stuff noone cares about lol.. ohwell.

okies well I think im done with the updateing for now... oooh! wait! in jsut over a month I have lost 14 lb on the atkins diet ^_^_^ im expecting to gain about 3-5 of it back due to this cruise... but Im still going to try to keep my body in ketosis. Ive been going to the gym 5 times a week, m,w,f I do step, a 50 min cardio class ^^: and t,th I do an abb class. I jsut feel betetr about myself working out. Must keep it up while on the islands.. it would be great if they have a fitness center....

i should get a part time job at tjmax.. working saturday mornings or something, you know 8-12? i dont like sleeping past 9 anyways, no what time i goto bed. Im sure i can get hired back, there begging when i shop there... but will they go through the trouble of hireing me 1 day? i would work 3 week nights if only the bus system ran past 1030, which it doesnt, and if i close i cant leave at 10 while everyone stays to recover... not right. oh ill think of something... need extra monies. course teh start of 2004 will give me alot. im expecting to be paid for 48 hours of unused unplanned time off, and my tax return.  the rest of this year though i think my money market is going to look a lil bare ^^'

"event","I jsut got a freakin promotion! hell yeah more moneies ^_^ wellnot yet.. stupid corporation politics... i get to work the pd3 (accounts 60-90 days past due) for 3 months, THEN post for the job which im garanteed cause out of everyone posting i have 1) most experiance with the exact job and 2) the manger thinks highly of me, and so does HIS manager.

all i got to do is make my #, and seeing its not so diffrent then the accounts i was working (past due 5-60 days) itll be a breeze."

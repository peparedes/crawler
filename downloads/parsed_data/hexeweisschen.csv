This has been sometime i figured this shit was deleted on this ive been gone so long...well to key myself again on what exactely has been goin on...erks cheated on me, he's smoking again and not just cigarettes and to tell u the truth i cant stand it. It makes me sick to think about it. My birthday was an extremely good and although hurtful day...the best part was I got the car I wanted =) the bad part was that erk made me feel like shit for even getting it. He doesnt listen anymore!!! He blows me off I feel like im just a f*buddy to him and wouldnt be surprised if i am. I feel so depressed and alone on this, cuz normally if i had an issue i could turn to him and i cant even do that anymore. I wanna cry every day it seems like and noboy knows how i feel. maybe i'm just a too bottle up person or perhaps its just all hope in guys is a false trap that only brings disapointment and grief. I wanna stop all my bad habits....theyre a waste of my time. humbug- well i got new cloths today i guess that could count for sumthing? hill went with me and it seemed happy enough. I saw star wars today too...finally evil actually wins at something, but hope is left. I stand waiting for erk cuz he was suppose to show. I even got him a ticket adn I felt like such a dumbass standing out in the breeze way of the amc theatre waiting for him and he never showed. called the ppl I though he'd be with and they lied through their teeth over the phone and u know what i couldnt be more hurt over that, must have stayed out there 15 minutes into the movie i waited so long. I must be a dumbass for asking him back out...its only been a couple of days and hes already making me regret it...I'm mean if he didnt wanna go why show interest? Just to hurt sumone who u say u loves feelings?....well enough of this shitty ass blubbering..I'm out

It was fun walking in the rain to walmart, setting off firecrackers that Scotty brought over, and just living the day up with Cyndra, tay, ryan, Scotty, Jonathen, Ab, and even haley =)!! Tay loved his gifts....the shirt, boxers, pocket watch, and chain.... he wore all today today. I love tay, and I love that my day didnt suck ass!!

But I'm supposed to be staying the night there next weekend that'll be grand! Erk's birthday is next weekend too, I already got him a present..I really do hope he likes it...I hate it when you take time on a b-day present and the person doesnt really like it and they show it. I mean comon at least fake it you know? But anywho, I got to talk to vicki today i was crossing the mc donalds parking lot with erk and she was kinda pissed off and asked to talk to us so me and erk came and talked, and it turns out allans the cause of it!!!

"event","I woke up alone in si's bed and walked down stair with sierra eating a bowl of cereal...So I got one. Turns out frank cant come home becuz he got in trouble,so he sat there and blamed it on ms.mom.That seemed very unfair to me. Si and me decided to go to the beach and what not so we went up stairs and changed into are bathing suits and set out down the road. We swam and played on the tourist and wave free beach. I liked the tourist free part, but the flat water kinda made me sad for the first 5 secs and me and sierra were laughing and playing in it. We barried eachother in the sand and made a naked sand dude(life size) and a naked chick so he wouldnt be lonely =). Sierra tryed her very hardest to make the sand dude(paul)be life like and happy, but it didnt work out too well. I told her maybe sand dudes cant be happy, so we made him limp instead. The chick was a hell of a lot easier to make and when we were finishing up on the two si says I hope my mom doesnt decide to take a walk and see me doing this. I said yeh you better pray the sand ppl come to life and run away....lmfao!!
We came back to her house around 3:30 and wanted sum food, packed...si took a shower and I only had time to rinse off, got dressed. And started on our way to the setan house to return si to her foster mom (ms nancy). I got to see frank!! His hairs long as a mother fucker...and he still wasnt in the best mood. He really wanted to fuckin leave! I dont blame him, but then again it was his fault, and again he was blaming his mom! I saw jp there, hes such a fuckin ass, he told sierra that I had sex with him...I WOULDNT FUCK THAT FAT ASS IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT!!! GOD damn that fucking pissed me off!! Guys are just as I said before theyre cocksuckers. Every single one of them have their moments! But anywho on a happier note I got to have a interesting convo with ms. mom when she was taking me home and she was nice as hell and stoped at 7-11 and get me sumthing. I love si and franks mom!! Im home now, I took a bath, Im burned as hell and you know what I couldnt be happier today!

We Were off cooking, I wasnt really sure how this was gonna turn out, but hey it was worth a try......and yeh we put raisins in the pancakes...ate watermelon, put bananas on top of the p cakes and poured syrup and strawberry syrup on top...a lot of fruit and it tasted better than it sounds. The messed up pancake went to kiki and jack...THEY LIKED IT!! Dominatrix was very unexpecting us and as si thought he had been sleeping....he was!!at one in the afternoon. BUM!!! Si didnt care too much for the dreads thing doms trying to pull off....ewwwwww!! Chillen over there was prolly the most exciting time of the day...NOT! Then we went back to my house and tryed to call  si's mom,but her cell was truned off so that doesnt help. Frank was being a real ass to si on the computer....Not wat youd call a very peaceful convo. But after all the shit I end up staying the night at sierra's. We went to mt trashmore for a lil while...and I think thats the most exciting part of the day......And the days not really over but this entry is...

She came home and took me to will's we got lost over on his road and were all like is that the house....but that wasnt the last time for today that I got lost....back on track I made it To wills...dun dun dun dun.....We chilled =) and other various things. Then at three 30 I had to leave...but that meant si could come over earlier, or I thought. She actually didnt get over till 7, but thats ok as long as she made it. She nailed me the secong i opened the door (ow) Then tay tay came and we were off for wat turned into 4 times getting lost(tay left us) and with all these wrong turns we ended up getting over to citgo on the other side of ocean lakes. First we were trying to find courtney then we were trying to find eric gerst....but we didnt find either of them instead we found a bottle of slice and two really hott guys. Who were fuckin perves major!!! And we werent gonna make it home in time so our alternative was to get a ride with the dudes and theyre dog who was dumb as a rock and it turns out its his name.....HE WAS FUCKIN HUGE(the guys dick, No I mean the dog) hmmm well lets see they dropped us off...and as the guy was getting out he does this gay as trip thing on me and grabs my ass ::smack:: si saw the whole thing, and how fake it was(hornball)! Hes like call me....um NO and he gave us his card.And the other guys like ""can yall give us domes"" and shit like that and were like uh yeah okay NO! GESE do me and si have a sign over our heads saying fuck us now or sumthing....me and her were fuckin shaking and shit hoping they wouldnt follow us back home, hoping they wouldnt follow us and sure as hell they did...we fuckin halled ass home, but cars are faster than bikes....GOD DAMMNIT!! But yeh were home now being bored (told erk on the phone what happened...he fuckin flipped and became a real ass....but we still love him) This whole prob with the lost shit could of been avoided if tay had stayed or I actually had a phone, or at least a clue where we were goin.

All the doors to the house were locked and me being a dumbass completely forgot that they never lock their windows so i found a coat hanger....dont know why it was just there.....and started throwing it at erk's window. After the 3rd throw he finally opened the blinds and came downstairs to open the front door for me. And then we talked, watched ""My cousin Vinni"", made pizza and cookies, talked to toni, made tea, turkey and ketchup sandwich......and um watched ""The butterfly effect"" and I kinda wish I had stayed there cuz then I wouldnt have had to ride my bike home and do nothing here......aint that about a bitch.......

I HATE IT! but yeh erk's trying to hook me up with trey? ""shocked"" Its really weird, but you know what I dont think its gonna happen. Nothings going right for me anyways and why should it start now....besides even if i did have a chance I'd get hurt in the end anyways.....no happy endings for the even more unhappy person.

I'd prefer staying with like amber or mimi anything,but goin out there. I wish my parents werent so much of a doosch about shit cuz its really retarded....but anywho flashing back through all my days that I missed....me and erk were chillen a good portion of the beginning and well...I got to have a few bruises I never really thought could be there....tay seemed to be at my aid at all the right moments and you know what I feel as if I owe him more than ever! but I met up with reap, darren, trey (for the first time?), dreads, dominatrix, chris, mike d.,....and a few ppl Ive never really talked to before. I ended up chilling with them and putting the cause into effect. My mom caught me for that shit...maybe cuz I stayed out so fuckin late, but another chance came up, but I didnt do it. Maybe thats why I cant stay here, and have my rents go out of town. But anywho the day after chillen with reap, darren and trey, I chilled with them the day after and that day had a lotta driving involved my ass was knumb after that shit! But us being able to chill and eat and all the other fun shit* was worth the ride.....
Yesterday sucked kinda it was the day that I really through a fit aboutn going to williamsburg. My room seems really empty too...haha....practically got the whole weekend canceled...but erk talked me out of it and now today really sucks cuz It seems I cant get out of it at all!!!

Erk brought his progress report today, and he practically swam to my house just to show my dad and ended up staying here and watching ""the mummy"" and ""mrs.winterbourne"". We were gonna try and watch the ""butterfly effect"",but that didnt work out very well considering it was a dvd and we dont have one installed out in the garage. So we ended up leaving(I was riding on the handle bars of the bike while erk rode)about 7-something.Went to wendy's and got sum food saw tanis and allan up there and gave them both hugs,erk didnt seem very thrilled about it. Then we chilled at the ditch till about 9:50-something and in the process...I made plans to chill with justin tommorow and erk got pissed about that hes all like I dont want you in the house you might try something with brandon....I mean wtf hell I dont get a flying fuck about brandon anymore! He lives in fucking mississippi for damn sake!....Sometimes I wish erk actualyl read my entries then maybe he could find out whats really in my fucking head and before I got off the phone with him hes all like if you come in the house, you max time is 5 minutes and if youre not out then brandon's calling jamie!! Fucking jackasses! I dont do shit and theyre all like this is Erk's house! It was justin's house way before his...and I hate that if I chill with justin erk is a total dick about everything and he's like if you come over here its for me and not anyone else!.....errrrrr that really pisses me off!

Then not even a minute after that Kelli calls me and shes all like a hey chicka we need to chill. So I started my journey to meet up with her half way onto las brisas. During my trip this guy in a silver truck stopped and he tells me if I walk down the street and take a right there is this huge keg party....he drives away and then these two guys in a red jeep thingy pull up next to me and theyre all like ""riding's a lot faster than walking. Do you want a ride?""....I'm like ""no I'm good!""....As theyre driving away theyre like ""comon we're gentlemen!"" Riiiiiiiight alil too old for me...cuz u know what anyone over like 19 is too old for me...haha never thought I'd hear myself say that, but its true and I should of realized it a bit earlier than this!....oh well....back to the day Kelli and ""Sir burns a lot"" were coming down the street as yhe two cars had left and Kelli ended up stayin at my house for awhile and then leaving and that left me and ""sir burns a lot"" to have a lil fun in my room and out on the streets....We collected like 56 flags and put them all around the ""Deaf child zone"" sign...It was fuckin funny as hell!! And we also lit a fag on fire and the remains of the tattered flag is resting on my wall in all its ashing glory!!!

Then we came back to my house and went off bum sighting fireworks! haha then me and duck jumped dominatrix's fence and I went skinny dipping -YAY- that was so awesome! Duck didnt come in unfortunately...lol....Guiltyness overwhelment! That's an understandable thing. We rode around a lot more and talked to kelli....my thoughts wanted to fly into my legs to leave, but duck was talkin.....so i stuck around and didnt blow the popsicle stand....lmao hahahahahahaha....sry joke of the day. My mom said it as we were driving shes all like ""lets blow these ppl""......lmao.....""I mean get away"" haley was all like ""what are you ppl talking about!!!!"" but back on track we rode around till about 11 and then planted are asses in wet chairs and talked,this is where I realize I'm horny....no no thats wrong its that I'm a horrible person....yes yes there you go...but yeh I'm alone and I just have to get over it......

My parents are at a concert, hope theyre having a good time. But anywho back on subject.......Duck has a gf and as much as I want something nothing really must happen....and if you are reading this please stop messing with me....because I'm regreting it more than you! Ryan called from PA, kinda got some advice for this subject and he thinks I should try hanging out with some girls instead of guys and to let some things die, but its a lot harder to break away from something you've never not been able to have....I need more advice, but I dont expect to get an answer in my comments in this journal because no one gives a shit so w/e.......

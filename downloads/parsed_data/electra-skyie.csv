It could be the mild drunkeness. 

I'm not dead, and to boot, i'm going to take the GED next weekend, and i got one of those things called a job. I'm also in love, but sadly that person isn't ""feeling"" me like that. I have plans to move out, and i'm making good on them, i still read my friends page here, because i care about you guys reading this, and like even if you don't post a comment back, and i know that we're all cool.

I think that everyone on my friends list, plus a few extra people should get together, like we should have one last party, to like remember each other (I watched less than zero today) we really are all growing up and going away, like I looked in the mirror today and I realized that I look older, like more and more like an adult, we all starting to look older, and I just want one last memory of being ""young"" to look back on.  I feel mad weird right now, I had a pretty interisting dream last night, and I think it's mad symbolic. OK, so I think Saturday we all should get together and party, I don't know where yet, but I think it's going to be my crib in manhattan (my dad and my step-mom are usually out on weekends) Only people I know are going to be allowed to be their and um, Byob, oh yeah and no stogies inside (prob no more than 20 people), so um like I sadly lost my cell phone, so I want y'alls to post feed back of if your down or not, and like friday i'll tell you guys if it's all go, and i'll put up a friends only post of my address. 

I'm going to be entering a GED program at the end of september, and i'm going to BMCC in the spring. Oh 
yeah, and I haven't left my house to see daylight in a week and a half.

<center><img src=""http://www.yayajon.com/watercircle/images/quizresultunicorn.jpg"" border=""0""><p>You are the most universal mythical beast ever. Sightings of the unicorn have been reported from all over the world, even in modern times. Unicorns are pure and incorruptible. In China, unicorns symbolized gentleness, good will, and wisdom. Christianity links the unicorn with Christ. It is said that unicorns would only allow virgin girls to see them, let alone touch them. They were easily lured into fatal ambushes by a virgin with some poachers waiting for the unicorn in nearby bushes. A unicorn's horn was a highly prized possession, which was reputed to have great healing capabilities. With the touch of its horn, a unicorn could bring back a person who had been dead for several hours. But when separated from the unicorn's body, the magic was significantly reduced. The unicorn had the body of a horse, a unique spiraling horn, and a lion's tail. They were pure white in color.<br>

<br><br>
<h2>Your Sex Sign is Taurus!</h2>	
You ooze sensuality and lust!<br>
You're down for anything, as long as it celebrates the natural body.<br>
You're a master at giving head - and as long as it feels good, you'll do it.<br>
Even your lover's nastiest fantasy!<br>
<br>
Taurus, you draw your intense sexuality from the earth.<br> 
You are strongly built - like a Greek or Roman nude.<br> 
Your sign is ruled by the planet Venus - giving you a lusty appetite for sex.<br>
<br>
Sexually, you favor the strong, silent type - someone as comfortable in the rugged outdoors as you are.<br>
Intellectual, geeky types don't appeal to you at all.<br>
<br>
Your home and surroundings are very imporant to you - it's always your place, not their's.<br>
While you'd never do a hotel fling, you'll have sex outdoors (beach, grass, whatever) -<br>
As long as there is some privacy.<br>
<br>
You are very oral - a master at oral sex.<br>
You love your lover to climax in your mouth.<br>
You love any and every kind of foreplay...<br>
and you'll do anything as long as it feels good.<br>
You are more pleasure-oriented than excitement-oriented.<br>
<br>
As for weird sexual practices, you are fixed in your likes and dislikes<br>
And you are are anything BUT conventional.<br>
Your basic, carnal nature leads you to engage frequently in oral and anal sex.<br> 
Why, you've even been known to give your partner a golden shower on occasion!

At 11 p.m tonight it will have been 36 hours straight, no nod off's, no power naps, nada. At 11 p.m tonight I will attempt to fall asleep, it should work. 

I battled against the sleep demon, and i won.

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar
In a West End town

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls

Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)

You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station

This is one of my all time fav songs, i'm pretty sure most if not all of you have heard it, but i dunno maybe it will remind you of something that will remind you of something, and they you'll have some kind of life changing revelation, or you'll just be reminded that you hate nu wave/synth pop, who knows?"

It was great to see her, we didn't talk much, but that's because neither of us have much to say right now, but it was great to just see her, hi sparky!

I also ran into another friend named jeff on the upper west side, and *drumroll* i applyed to hollywood video!! I really hope I score the job, it's only a few blocks from my dad's crib, and think it'd be awesome to work in a video store, because i'm such a *loser/slacker/underachiever* we've all seen clerks, you know the deal. and i really want that employee discount, and not to mention the MONEY, i need it, i want it, and i must have it.

"event","ah, yesterday was a saturday night, and for the first time in about 2 months i went out and chilled with friends, we headed to sophies (i feel a little guilty w/myself about getting drunk/drinking, but i've proved to myself that i CAN go for months w/o drinking) and guess who i ran into, guess! Give up? JOEY, JARVIS, and ATTILA! It was so wonderful to see them after mad long. This could have been a much longer story, but i wasn't. 

you know what i've realized, there are alot of empty people in this world, and some people choose to hang out with them and ignore it, or hang out with them reguardless of it, or avoid them like the plauge. Empty people are like zombies, driven by no goal, like they just comsume, music, movies, gossip, tv, food, meaningless (like really really meaningless) social interactions, and they are completely blind to it, or maybe these people who we label ""empty"" live in their own existence which some of us are too blind to see?

"event","Ah, i feel a revalaton in my life coming on, I don't know what, and I don't know why. 

It could be because of the distance i'm putting in between myself and the world, i think it's going to be healty and beneificial, maybe it isn't, this could really be my first (well maybe like 10th) step into madness, who's knows, all the best people in the world are at least a little crazy. I saw party monster today by the way, i though it was a good movie, sometimes in life people don't take things for what their worth, ""give in, give in, give in, and you shall recive the gift of a lifetime, a view into my world"" that's not from the movie, i made it up right now, as i type. I'll put it in a screenplay one day, it sound really wack now that i read it again, but i can make anything cool, segway, either tonight, or when my heart is up to it, I will write  ideas for all the screenplays that float through my mind, (ingnore the stupid quote, it bares no reflection on the broadness of my mind) many people have no clue what my dreams and asperations are, but that's because i don't make myself truly available to many folks. I sound way way way more pretentious than i am right about now, I think that's because mylife is in slow motion, but my brain is moving really fast right now, do you know that feeling, do you? 

hello, can you still here me? I think we're breaking up......"

"event","lordy, i'm not realing sweating the last drama, because it's really bullshit, i'm too smart for it. 

But.
This has some serious mystery.

In the crazy mixed up world of jersey, i'm cleaning my room (whole nother story), and i'm also sitting on some words, i'm smart and i can pick up hints, so heres the deal, i'm writing this to make the shawdows of what's happening come to light, so i can better understand the situation from all sides, untill a point (it's mad weird i didn't try to put myself in the mix, nor did my friend, 

so  a close friend of mine (that i've known her for a long time)told me that she was dating a guy we both know (this is not a girl guy girl fight kinda thing),they were going out for like three days, or something really short like that, i have some previous history with the guy, but it's nothing really, my friend knew about it. I was a little i don't want to say skeptical or suprised that they are dating, like something much milder, i was happy for her, he's a cute guy (when i saw him like 2 years ago), and apparenty got cuter. She was happy and exicted about it (a little too much, there's some saying about that) So she's calls me one day, and calles me shermane, very, very ,very weird. She hasn't called me shermane in seriously like 2 years, so a red light went off, i def realized that she been talking to him about me (i didn't like think it was bad or some malice crap), so anywho a few days pass, and he's deny the relationship to mad people (i sorta figured that that was a big possiblity) so even though she hasn't spoken to him they are over, ok so were talking tonight, and i want her to do a 3 way call ( i wasn't going to insigate or anything, but that is on my part kinda meddlish on hindsight) so she says no, and i pull a sammie and go on this tip about how many times has she made me ""go there"", i was laughing, and she knows me, and know's i was off making her make the call, but she's says like in the middle of this ""he doesn't like you anyway"", WHOA, where did that come from, red light number two that they were talking about me, so i tottaly say ""have you been talking about me""? and so she tells me something about how she mentions that she wanted to hang out with me with him, and he says ""i heard she got fat"" (ok, i'm not going to front in like decemberish i was HUGE i tottaly blew up, as you can see in my lj icon, i posted new pics, look for them!, and wasn't i always fat? On another tip it made me feel kinda bad that i was slipping and people picked up on it, but i'm getting it togeter and dropping pounds!) She says she defended me and i don't doubt she did, but i KNOW there was more to the convo, i can just sense it, ok so that in itself doesn't bother me, but the fact that my friend might be insecure about how she looks, and like be jealous of me in some way(as i mentions something happened like two years ago, ok i went to watch tv i'm back, me and her are going to talk either tommorrow or when her mom gets off the phone, i know it will all be cool, we really close, and it's not that serious, just mysterious, or maybe i want it to be that way b/c i'm bored from cleaning my room all day, don't know, you decide."

"event","These issues need to be addressed, for my own sake, and i guess to give others a glimplse of my perspective, s'pose so, i'm glad that i fought with travis and decided to write this, i really needed to write this, for me. 

I'm not going to going into any of my emotional reasonings, or triumphs or failures, that's personal.

Why I dropped out of school. 


<lj-cut text="" what started out as a responce to travis, became so much more"">


My Education stopped at 7th grade, when I was 12 years old, i pretty much stopped going to school, I became a ""truant"", I didn't go to the park, or talk on the phone with friends ,i did nothing, i don't know why, and prob won't know for a long, long time. I stopped caring about school work, which really didn't matter much school was straight bs anyway. I don't think i've been to school for a solid two weeks after 6th grade, i know i haven't. I've learned so much (something i didn't even realize utill i really started thinking about it) because i taught myself. Before i go on, heads are going to start thinking, ""well where were her parents"", I'm a smart kid and this is the real world. My parents are split, my mom works full time, After I guess like 5th grade I really started raising myself to some degree, it wasn't that serious, most kids do it. Even if my parents could have been there more, they wouldn't have been able to keep me in check, they can't even now. I dunno most kids who don't understand have been coddled to some degree, or have just had more involved parents than me. This is the real world,  i don't blame my parents, pleanty of kids are raised like me in this soceity and stick with the good grades and perfect attendance, bottom line, i'm not them. 

Theres more in between but it doesn't affect the story.
I continued on the path of getting by, untill the 9th grade, when i entered high school. I made some kick ass grades (i also got in trouble here and there) I joined the debate team, i was the best novice on the team, I won mad trophyies during my short lived carrer, but i still wasn't going to school everyday. I hit the absent limit. Right about here people are aging going to say ""So why didn't you get you shit together and not miss school!"", i don't know, i don't know, i don't know. I don't know why i don't go to school, heads can be skeptical if they want, but life just isn't that simple, i know is hard for mad people to compehend, except people like me understand.So, they put me on academic suspension, i'd have to repeat the 9th grade, and i couldn't debate anymore, i was tottaly crushed (now that i think about it, i'm not sure if i knew i'd be put on a.s before it happened) I walked out of the door, and till this day i never went back. 

Sitting at home is sunk real deep into depression, the school took something real deep away from me, The feeling that i felt special, that hurt, and still hurts when i read the words. I'm pretty sure i stated that i wasn't going to get to emotional, but i gotta say this, When your a kid that pretty much slips through the cracks most of the time, when your parents have no time for you, at school you never the favorite, your never the star, when the only other times people thought you were special you fucked it up, to have the CHANCE and succeed, was like nothing a kid like me had before, (I now in my life realize that i have alot of talent, at many many things , and that i'm special in alot of peoples eyes, but hindsight is hindsight) they fucking took my soul, and i died for a minute. 

I moved to new york to live my dad and his girlfriend, me and my mom needed a break, and i needed to start over. I started looking for highschool found urban was completely honest. I was at risk kid, and a tottal fuck up, and i never ceased to not live up to people expectations, needless to say, i got in. 

I started going to urban i loved it, The kids were fucking amazing, the teachers were amazing, the work was actually challenging, I felt like i fit in, I belonged, I was never able to say that before urban. I stared going to school everyday mainly because i was scared of making my dad and his girlfriend upset, i didn't want to get kicked out again, i was already too much for one parent and this was my last fucking shot, I didn't want to be a fuck up (eventhough i realzed now that i am, it's something that i'm just going to have to deal with, eventhought i love me and my parents love me, i realize that i'm a throw away kid.) But that facade eventually slipped, It's really hard to be a phony. I slipped back into my old habits shit fell apart by april, but some how remained intact enough for me to,  return to urban in the fall. 

After a crazy drugged out summer and a brithday, I moved back in with my mom. I came back to school 1 year older, but i was tottaly 12 again, I vowed to get my act together and change, I really did for like litterally a month. Then the fuck up in me took over, i got stressed out over court dates (again, i'm a fuck up) and i had one late night and i let it snowball, I let this deep down fear inside of me take over, I let myself once again sabotage myself. I laid in bed for like a million years untill like a month ago really, there was nothing my can do, I control ME, its always been this way. I also felt very misunderstood, i was, and still am, but I took my on failings so hard, and let them snowball. 

I didn't have a plan in october, I told myself and everyone else things, but i didn't have a plan, I spent most of my time smoking pot and drinking, I'm 20 pounds heavier to thank for it (well 40 in january, but i've begun to get it in check. I don't see myself as a statistic, I see myself as special, more special than most people realize, more than i even reailze. I think there something special deep down inside of me, I think there is alot more to me that i'll ever know.I have a host of problems to overcome, and very little time before all hope is lost. I'm still a fuck up and always will be, but that's what makes me Sammie, I'm trying to be a fuck up in recovery. I grow every day, and become a better person, I have a plan, a real world plan, and i just have to dig deep, deeper than i've ever dug within, and rise to the occassion, and rise to life.

I realize skimming this back, that this is the short version, there is so much more to it, but i already spent an 1.5 writing this, so i'm not going to go back, or it'll be midnight when i'm done. I also realized, that if someone was tottaly clueless they'd think i was a drug addict, it really looks like that, the words i ues and the way i describe myself, I have a problem, but it isn't with substance. I don't know,  if anyones going to read this, or if they are going to be able to pick up the emotion which i put into my words, i don't know if this will touch anyone, or anyone will understand me better because of this, I've said more in this essay than i've said in therapy, but i realize that it's only the first step of making it up the stairway of life. this is getting sappy. 

BTW, this is real, my words are real, so don't be suprised that if someone flames it that i get really really outraged and crazy, i wasn't trying to express teenage mellodrama or whine about my life, I was trying the express a part of me so people could better understand, and so i could too. Not everyone chooses the choices they make. If you think about that sentence, it really is true. <lj-cut text=""Why I dropped out of highschool, what started out as a responce to travis, became so much more"">"

"event","fuck it, i need to quit, people hate it when i tell the the truth about themselves, like if in some form it wasn't true, they wouldn't get nasty, and if it was a total lie people would be able to defend themselves in a constructive manner, if some one asks me for the truth, or how i see it really, i'm not going to lie or sugar coat it, wouldn't that be worse than brutal honesty? I read people really really well, but i usually never tell people about themselves, unless they ask me. I wish people could see me as deep as i see them, it all comes to that doesn't it?


I think it's time we ALL stop trying to discuss emotional things across the internet, b/c shit allways comes across wrong, yeah i would have said the same things in person, and they would have to, but we would have said MORE, and came to a calm intelligent conclusion.

Most of you cats know what i'm talking about."

"event","I was thinking about two things today, just now really. 

First, why is WWII and that whole generation and their children glorfyied? Is this something that always happens in history, or is 1945-60s that god damn amazing? I've seen some of band of brothers, i really wanna see the whole series, and i must admit that it blah blah blah good stuff, just insert a bunch of glory filled ajectives between the blahs, but it all wasn't heroic good looking young men fighting evil, c'mon people act like those were the days, fuck it, they were, i wouldn't even be thinking about it this much if they wern't, I wasn't there, but, well actually i don't wish i was their, I'm a black woman, geeze the 50's really sucked for black people, ok that though it over. 

Second, god oh god why can't guys wear their hair like they did in the 50's, those haircuts are so sexy, like guys look so classy and handsome with their hair slicked like that, like the whole style of mens dress from the about 1940-70 (before the leg bottoms got too big) was so classy, and womens clothing too especially from the 40s and 50s was so cool, people forgot what class is, one day i tell you, one day, i'm going to being glamour back in full effect, you have my word on it.

I hope every one who's reading this has had a good day, and is happy!"

"event","No man is an island, but think girl right here feels like one, i did this to myself, i tottally brought this on myself, and i think it's needs to happen, but I also think i'm desperatly scared, and tottaly in denial. I need to look within myself, it's the only way i'm truly going to shed this old layer of skin. Isolation is a scary thing, especially when you begin to feel detached from the world, some people love it, others loathe it and always find some way to truly avoid it, i'm just scared i'll never come back. A fried of mine told me, someone i've known for a few years, that deep down inside, i'm the type of person that NEEDS people, and i'm am, and i'm not ashamed to admit it, but i feel somewhat like a unic detached from everyone i know, but i know this is good for me, i really truly am at the crossroads of my life, I could either settle, and continue to roll around, or i can dig deep and really take a step up. This is begining to sound like a rant, a crazy crazy rant, but i as write this and as i read this i realized that it is tottally pure, it's straight from my soul, the worlds you read right now are straight from my heart and into the computer, i am creative, i'm not quite feeling that i just wrote that, but i'm not pressing backspace, i'm just letting in all come out. 

I begining to feel strong, and balanced, and that is true freedom.

I have found my god, and it lies within."

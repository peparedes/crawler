"event","I am very busy lately.  It's good, but every once in a while, I let it fill me up so much that I feel overwhelmed.

I had a crazy dream.  I won't go into extreme detail, but the kicker is that an evil man that Wiggy and I were chasing attacked Wiggy with a hammer, severely injuring him.  I was so furious, I disarmed him and reduced him to a puddle of blood with his own hammer.  In any case, I'm protective of my puppy.

Work is going well.  I'm getting involved in more project work, which I prefer to the mundane meeting scheduling-type tasks of the typical executive assistant.

Things are whirling through my head a hundred miles an hour lately, and I can't pick out anything else to mention at the moment.  

I hope things are well with you."

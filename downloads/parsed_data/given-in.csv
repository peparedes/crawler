"event","my new obsession : www.thefacebook.com  I don't really understand the obsession, but it's taken me over.

my phone drowned a little bit during sungod because of a very dirty kiddie pool and jenny so nobody can call me but hopefully the phone people will replace it and not ask my why it doesn't work.  the story is that it broke itself.  these phones are far too sensitive anyway."

"event","so after the whole stealing ordeal, we decided to go to small claims court in hopes of getting some money back.  in the process, the people of judge judy call us to see if we want to be on their show.  which is completely random and weird but for like, 15 minutes we actually considered it.  cuz if we go to small claims court it's not guaranteed that we get money back and if we go on judge judy, we all get $500 for appearing and if we win, then we're guaranteed to get back what we're owed within 30 days.  but that's cuz the show would pay us and not lily.  so its not really what we wanted cuz we would rather that she pay us back cuz she's the one who stole from us and if we did go on judge judy she would get out of paying us and she would get $500.  so we decided not to go.  but how weird would it have been if one day three years from now i was flipping channels and there was a re-run of judge judy on and my suitemates and i were the ones on the show?  it'd be crazy.  what a crazy year.

on a different note, it's so hot outside!  we went to the beach today and baked and now i am almost tan.  i love living in san diego.  everyone should come visit me."

"event","screw the paper, my addiction has started. on with the roomate story...

so then winter quarter came and all quarter long i worried about lily cuz in the back of my head i always thought i would walk into our room one day and she would be all comatose and clutching a bible... again... so i always tried to talk to her about what was happening with her family and her life so that at least she felt like she had someone to talk to, even though we always told her she could tell us anything.

also winter quarter our suite started getting stolen from.  it started off with $80 in cash out of my purse and $60 in cash out of emily's wallet.  we thought it was the maid cuz we had gotten a new maid that quarter and whenever we were being stolen from it would out of the common room, which is probably our own fault, but we seriously live in the common room, so its always got our stuff in it.  

then the thefts turned into emily's wallet out of her room, jenny's wallet out of the common room, jenny's money off her desk, and nore's money out of the common room.  except now things were getting stolen in the evening when the maid wasn't there.  so it was getting quite sketch and we didn't know what was happening.

and then the big day came when my purse, emily's purse, jenny's purse, and lily's purse all got stolen out of our rooms in a period of an hour when there were people in the suite and lily was in our room sleeping.  so we called campus police AGAIN and they came down and we all filed reports.  but while i was on the phone with my mom out on our balconey, i see lily crossing the street with a black bag over her shoulder and when i called out to her, she said she was going to the bank to cancel her credit cards.  in the back of my head i wondered why she was carrying a black bag if her stuff just got stolen, but i didn't think anything of it cuz i was in the process of cancelling my credit cards.

later that night, macy's of la jolla calls my house who then calls me to tell me that my wallet was found in a trashcan outside of macy's at the mall.  so we all freak out, cuz that's what we do, and drive down there to claim it.  turns out that my purse was in emily's wallet with emily's and jenny's checkbooks, half of jenny's wallet that got stolen the week before and some other woman's wallet who we didn't know.  so then we run around the mall looking in every single trashcan for anything else that might be our's but we didn't find anything.

we come back home and walk into our suite and on the floor of the common room is two pies.  we asked where the pies came from and lily says, ""if you go the bank and get teary eyed, they'll give you $20, and with that $20, i bought you guys these pies cuz i felt bad that your stuff got stolen""  i'm an idiot and didn't think anything of it, but jenny and emily had their suspicions.  

so at dinner we have a pow wow and discuss the idea that lily was the one that was stealing from us.  and then we basically pieced together that she's poor, was always around when someone was stolen from, made up a lame story about the pies, and none of her stuff was found in the trashcan despite the other three of us having stuff found.  

so we came back from dinner and went through our room and found her driver's license that she reported was stolen along with new jewlery, new clothes, new perfume, a new cd player, and all this other crap.  so we freak out for the 27th time that day and were convinced.

but then that night lily ended up not spending the night here cuz i think she knew that we were suspicious of her and so she spent the night at a friend's place.  the next morning she comes back and says to me ""katie, i have an appointment right now bu when i get back i really really need your help with something.  it's really really important""  so then i think she's going to admit to stealing from us.  so when she leaves, i freak out again and call campus police and tell them that i think my roomate is about to admit to stealing with us.  this, by the way, was the 19th time we had called campus police in the last day.  so they just tell me to wait and see what she says and if she admits it then call them. 

so then lily doens't come back from her appointment and one our friends from a few buildings down comes by and says ""lily's in our suite right now, she crying, she's really upset, she says that sky's (sky is lily's supposed ex-boyfriend) the one that's been stealing from you guys""  so i say ""bullshit"" really loudly and storm down there to talk to her.

and then all this bullshit happens and i cried a lot cuz i was just frustrated with her lying cuz she kept insisting the somehow sky came down from pasadena where he lives that day and came into our suite and nobody heard him and nobody saw him, but he's the one that stole our stuff and he's the one that made her spend our money, and he was at the mall with her but he didn't go into any of the stores with her so he wouldn't be on any surveillance but he stood outside and told her what to buy cuz he said it would make her feel better.  and that was when we came to the conclusion that lily's a kook and sky doesn't exist cuz none of us have ever seen him or met him, she doesn't know his last name or his phone number, despite him being her ex- boyfriend, and her stories just weren't matching up.  

so then she got kicked out of housing and took the rest of winter quarter off, which during that time period, she posted in one of my suitemate's xangas that she was coming back to ucsd in the spring that our res dean said that she could live with us and that she didn't know what we were afraid of cuz she didn't do anything wrong, god just taught her not to steal...  what a kook.  

this is the longest post ever, nobody wants to read it. oh well, it's nice to sort out the story."

"event","after so many years of holding out i've given in... haha, mostly so i can read anna's journal cuz i'm a loser like but weird things happen to me...

let's start with the greatest story EVER of my roomate, well this one isn't the greatest, just the earliest

so we all move in and the housing here is suite style so there are 8 of living in a suite with two doubles and four singles.  i was in double with lily, a quiet asian girl who was always really sweet and considerate.  

throughout the quarter my suitemates and i noticed that lily was kind of secluded and seemed like she was having issues with depression but we never really knew how bad it was or what she was dealing with cuz she never told us about it.  we just tried to talk to her a lot and hoped that she would talk to us if there was ever anything she had to deal with.

then at the end of quarter during finals week, i come back from my chemistry final and i walk in and all of my suitemates are crying.  so i start to freak out a little bit and i was really confused and i kept asking what was going on and my suitemate emily just said, ""lily took pills"".  

so i walk into our room and she's slouched over on her bed with one of my suitemates, danici, holding her up while everyone's gathered around and crying and emily's on the phone with 911.  my other suitemate jenny and i have to go stand on the street to guide the ambulance in and during this whole ordeal i'm just freaking out and crying on the street.

so then the rest of the day consisted of sitting at the hospital waiting to see her and being really scared that something like this had happened.  she kept insisting that she didn't have a problem but we all wanted her to go to an institution but she refused.  and her mom and family even came down to see her cuz they heard about the hospital but somehow she convinced them to go cuz she claimed it was accidental overdose which was quite shady but what are gonna do?  

but then it was kind of okay cuz after that whole thing she started to talk to us more and go to counseling so we thought the next quarter would be okay.  

this has to be continued cuz it's far too long and i have a paper to write"

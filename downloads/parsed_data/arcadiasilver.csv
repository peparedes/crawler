But its morning, I havent slept, I have heartburn and I found out I've developed an allergy to bananas.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dear Alan Greenspan and the Baby Boomer Generation:<br /><br /><span style=""font-size: x-large; ""><em><strong><a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/07/13/alan-greenspan-its-gen-xers-fault-theyre-out-work/""><span style=""font-size: xx-large; "">FUCK YOU.</span></a></strong></em></span><br /><br />Fuck your privileged generation that coasted on the benefits your parents and grandparents created. Fuck your generation that had unionized jobs, a stable social safety net, that could go through college on the cost of a summer job, that could support a middle class lifestyle of a single income, that had everything fucking handed to you in your childhood.&nbsp;<br /><br />The same generation that then proceeded to grab and grab and grab and grab and spend their adulthoods destroying the same benefits you enjoyed for every generation after. Then the Cold War came and you taught yourselves and your children that military might is the only answer to national security. That We Are Right and They Are Wrong and you dont have to try and understand where someone else is coming from became the national dogma. Then your kids came out of high school in the early 90s and into the aftermath of Reagan's economy and had to jump from job to job to because that was their only option. But that was because they wore grungy clothes and listened to devil music and were lazy, not because the Trickle Down system and the preference of massive corporate business structures over medium and smaller businesses started to chip away at entry level work.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then your grandkids, the Millenials and Gen Y are graduating from college with gargantuan student debt and draconian pay back laws and no safety net and no ability to save and put away for the future where they wont have Medicaid or Medicare or Social Security and all the blue-collar middle class jobs are now overseas and healthcare is astronomically expensive. And where (after adjustment for inflation) they are getting paid LESS than you were when you were entering the workforce and looking at the bleak reality of zero pay raises and no benefits while corporate payouts and salaries continue to skyrocket and the job market continues to contract and contract and entry level jobs that college grads should be taking are demanding years of experience and in-job training and anything that doesnt demand that are &quot;unpaid internships&quot; which is nothing more than fancy language for corporate slave labour. And in the face of all of this? We're still more productive than you could ever hope of being. And most of us are working two jobs just to be able to afford our student loan bills.<br /><br />But we're lazy. We're spoiled. We're the ones doing it wrong and we just need to haul ourselves up by our bootstraps and stop complaining.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because we caused the housing bubble.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because we caused the two wars that have put our country under astronomical debt.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because we caused the banking crisis.<br /><br />Kiss my ass, Alan Greenspan."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Mrrr, pagany blather within."">&nbsp;There are days where holding to my faith is hard. Its hard for people to understand it, because of all the negative connotations surrounding paganism. I understand that there's mixed messages out there, from the satanic cult scare stereotypes to the crazy, hippie treehugger. Its the same with Christians, I think. The bad ones, the crazy ones, the most intolerant and bigoted ones get attention, the kind and tolerant and truly Christ-like vanish under the spectacles of media darlings and attention-seekers like Terry Jones and his Quran burning. <br /><br />I get a whole gamut of reactions, from the Concerned and Loving Christian Wishes to Save My Soul (But Not Save Me) to the more common Fire and Brimstone Condemnation. I've been ostracized for my beliefs before. I've had death threats, threats of bodily mutilation and forcible sterilization. My faith has completely invalidated my existence and rights in some people's eyes, if not my capacity for logic, problem solving or reason. Because clearly I'm crazy.&nbsp;<br /><br />And inevitably, I always get that three letter word: why? Why isn't Christianity good enough for you? As if I'm snubbing Jesus for not wearing the right brand of blue jeans. And its hard to explain because sometimes people dont WANT to understand my reasons or because they CANT understand not being Christian. And I can't do anything about that, but its still frustrating for them to demand an explanation from me as if I was their child to scold and know that no explanation will ever suffice. Or worse, they look for all the reasons they've been told people aren't Christian, looking for unspoken signs of child abuse, of parental grudges, rage against society,&nbsp;delinquent&nbsp;behavior or other teenaged&nbsp;grievances. I always feel infantalized in these situations.&nbsp;<br /><br />But they always demand proof and reason. And no manner of eloquence or oration will satisfy. But sometimes, one a whim, I will be reminded why I chose this path. Today I found a prayer of Sehkmet, one of my patron goddesses and it was a relief to see my reasons embodied in a simple prayer.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Translated by E.A. St George<br />Taken from her booklet Under Regulus.</em><br /> <br /><em>Behold, I smell the earth before the mighty one.<br />Behold how I have kept the vigil in the shrine of Sekhmet.<br />Behold, I am the child, the child of Sekhmet, the lady of the east.<br />I am with her. I am one with her.<br />I am Sekhmet and the flames of all those who praise her.<br />I am the hand of the powerful goddess, wearer of the solar disc.<br /> I am the twice beautiful one, more splendid than yesterday.<br />I am she who goes forth with Ra.<br />I am she.<br /> <br />My hair is the hair of Sekhmet, the golden one.<br />My eyes are the eyes of the lioness.<br />My ears are the ears of the goddess.<br />My nose is the nose of she who can sniff out all evil.<br />My teeth are the fangs, which can devour the darkness.<br />My neck is the neck of the divine goddess.<br />My hands are the hands with long claws.<br />My forearms are the forearms of the mighty one.<br />My backbone is golden and it shines with splendour.<br />My chest is the chest of the mighty one of terror.<br />My belly and back are the belly and back of Sekhmet.<br />My buttocks are strong, as the goddess.<br />My hips and legs are the hips and legs of the goddess.<br />My feet are the clawed feet of the lion goddess.<br />There is no part of me that is not of the goddess.<br />I am Sekhmet who cometh forth in the dawn.<br />I am the power of Ra by day.<br /> <br /><strong>I shall not be dragged back by my arms<br />And none shall lay violent hands upon me, lest I destroy them utterly.<br />Neither man nor god shall hurt me, nor shall the living,<br />Nor shall the holy dead detain me.<br />Nor shall the demons destroy me in battle,<br />For I am Sekhmet and I shall eat off their faces.<br />I am she who cometh forth.<br />I am yesterday and I am the seer of millions of years.<br />I am the power of the divine judge.<br />I dwell in the east.<br />I am the lady of eternity, the unveiled one. .<br />My name is created to defy all evil.</strong><br /> <br />I am the flame that shineth in the sanctuary.<br />I am Sekhmet.</em><br /><br />My goddess advocates the eating of faces. &nbsp;I think&nbsp;that's&nbsp;all I need to say on the matter.&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

A humongous, gargantuan, ridiculous bitch. Karma wishes it were a big a bitch as Vriska Sekret. &nbsp;She's done horrible things in the course of the comic. She killed Aradia,&nbsp;paralyzed&nbsp;and later killed Tavros, blinded Terezi (all of this she got her comeuppance for, though), deliberately creates Bec Noire (the&nbsp;indestructible Final Boss that has killed thousands of others, including two of the human character's parents) because she wanted to defeat him as her greatest and final challenge as a gamer. She's done horrible things, and she doesn't pretend otherwise; even if in some cases she was perfectly justified in her actions in the terms of Troll Society.&nbsp;<br /><br />But watching her interact with John and watch her slowly open up to him through the later half of the story so far, and watch her show regrets for some of her actions balanced her out a bit. Of course, we have to remember that for her culture, Vriska's actions are akin to that overly ambitious student taking college level courses in the tenth grade. Ambitious, flagrantly so, but not bad.&nbsp;<br /><br />And her decision to go fight Bec Noire is not a surprise: its what she created him for. But at least now, I think there's a bit of regret in what she did concerning him. I think she realized that in her ambition, she nearly brought everything she really cherished to to ruin. She wants to go protect her friends and its very obvious that John has done more to her than just influence her to be a bit of a better person. She might've loved him, or just regarded him as a friend. Passing on her dice to him also pretty much means that she believed she wouldn't win her fight against Bec.&nbsp;<br /><br />Which makes her &quot;death&quot; up in the air. She reached God Tier in her game, so the question becomes if Terezi stabbing her to keep her from&nbsp;inadvertently&nbsp;killing the other Trolls qualifies as a &quot;just&quot; death*. And its easy to believe that it is a just death, considering her actions through the story so far. She is a villain. A manipulator, liar, backstabber, and proud of it. But her hand in killing the other trolls was not purposeful. Not to mention, getting stabbed in the back is neither heroic or just. Heroes do not die heroic deaths that way, neither do&nbsp;villains&nbsp;retribution. Vriska's death was pure chump, and she'll be back. She's pretty much the only one who can stand up to Gamzee right now.&nbsp;"

"event","The Goddess' mercy and love be with the people of Japan in the coming weeks and months. The world is with you, as are our prayers and hopes. <br /><br />There has been an explosion at Fukushima One nuclear power plant this morning, but all reports coming in say that the reactor core and its shielding are still in tact and TEPCO is trying to use seawater to cool the reactor. The radiation leak is still in effect and the Japanese government has expanded the evacuation radius to ten miles, which now includes 45,000 people. The main concern is keeping the reactor cool to prevent a meltdown. But as an effect, the water supply to several prefectures such as Fukushima, Chiba, Miyagi and others have lost their water supply. <br /><br />Also a reminder that as of my current knowledge, Japanese Red Cross has NOT asked for assistance from the American Red Cross. So donating your money to them will not do much at the moment. And also a reminder that there are organizations out there that claim to take money on behalf of relief efforts, and are really scaming you AND the Japanese people. Its always best to donate directly to the established organizations when possible. <br /><br />So far, Kubo Tite, Paku Romi, Morita Masakazu, and Fumiko Orikasa have all checked in and are alive. There's a more exhastive list for the mangaka, seiyuus, and bands over <a href=""http://ackisnotback.livejournal.com/41691.html"">here</a>. Thank goodness many of these people are alive and well. However, despite this, dont be surprised if some anime and manga go on hiatus for a few weeks as the nation tries to settle itself. Please be understanding and patient and show our support for our favorite authors and artists, especially those who may have lost family in this tragedy. <br /><br />[WARNING: Triggery stuff below]<br /><br />Also: Dear American Members of the Internet, this is not an appropriate time to start showing off how spectacularly douchebaggy you can be. Facebook is already a hive of scum and villainy, and this business of going around proclaiming that &quot;God is still angry about Pearl Harbor&quot; puts you on the cusp of a slippery slope you dont want to take a trip down. This is part of why the world really thinks that our country is insane and full of cruel, arrogant, vicious people. <br /><br />You do not represent me. You do not voice my opinions. When, one day, the situaton is turned around, I hope you have the self-awareness to be humbled before your own arrogance. But I suppose that might be a bit too much, hoping you'll be introspective. <br /><br />"

That's just silly!<br /><br />Women just need to keep their legs closed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Aside from the attempted slut shaming of sexually active women and the ridiculous notion that the onus of preventing unwanted pregnancy falls only on the woman (never hear people telling men to keep it in their pants, do you?) this idea begets a rather disturbing thought when you remember that a significant percentage of women who have abortions are poor and lower class. And despite what some white, wealthy, Conservative legislators and pundits may believe, the economic cost of a baby is significant. Even surrendering the child for adoption requires a hospital stay for delivery that costs thousands of dollars. And when these women don't have healthcare because we refuse to care for the most disadvantaged of fellow Americans, abortion is the only viable option.&nbsp;<br /><br />But you haven't been forcibly raped? (within an approved parameter of rape) Haven't been the victim of incest? (and under the age of 18) Child isn't going&nbsp;to kill you? (and even then, this isn't guaranteed if some people get their way) Then tough luck, you shouldn't have had sex. When we present this situation to poor women as legislators across the country continue to hack away at the already threadbare social net, how far away are we from just saying &quot;if you can't afford healthcare and raising a child, or refuse to raise a child in less that desirable conditions, then you shouldn't have sex&quot;? How far are we from just flat out saying that sex is only for the ones who can afford it?&nbsp;<br /><br />When you take away all other options, you leave women with only one.&nbsp;<br /><br />For bonus rage on the ongoing anti-woman, anti-lower class&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;thats become painfully&nbsp;prevalent&nbsp;on multiple levels of government, <a href=""http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/news/state/head-start-cuts-in-frederick-county-come-with-controversial-comments"">county&nbsp;commissioners&nbsp;think women should stay at home so they dont have to provide Head Start for children</a>."

"event","My take on the beloved &quot;Ichigo dies and must be konsoed&quot; trope. Still in the Virus AU, but I'm still very proud of it. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Shed My Skin, Oh Are You Ready For Me?"">The sky had gone crimson and gold, shining like blood across the jagged, gap-toothed cityscape. Kurosaki Ichigo sat on the precipice of one of the few remaining skyscrapers, his back to the scoop of earth - nearly a mile wide - that still smoldered with the cooling slag of melted steel and glass. <br /><br />Steel, glass, and the ash of a thousand lives lost in its circumference. Including his. <br /><br />He'd felt it the moment the inflating sphere of shadow and desolation blinked into existence in the heart of Karakura Town. He felt it as it swallowed down blocks of buildings and streets and cars - all vanishing inside the rippling, liquid walls that spread across his hometown. His friends, the places he hung out at, got cornered by school bullies and had school yard scuffles, took his sisters play and spent nights chasing down hollows and konsoing lost souls; they all vanished into the black and never returned. <br /><br />He'd felt it the moment his body was incinerated: a wash of weightless, disorientating vertigo as his soul was set free forever. He nearly fell out of the sky as everything spun away in a dizzying blur of color and quivering stomach. Then just as quickly as it came, it passed, leaving him sweaty and scrambling to reclaim his wits and swallow down the horror of what he'd just witnessed and what almost happened. And so Kurosaki Ichigo died that day and for good.<br /><br />He stood at the utter most height of the tallest building remaining in Karakura Town and for a moment, understood Rukia's obsession with climbing. Here, the air was sharply cool and thin and everything spiralled below his feet in tiny, half-shadowed detail. Here, it looked like Karakura was the same old, a sleepy little suburb that laid dozing in the last snatches of night. But even now, people should be moving, should be students (like himself - no, like he was) walking towards school buildings, wagemen and wagewomen trundling towards bus stops with breifcases and yawning behind paper cups of coffee. The first little pulses of life. But instead, all there was was a shroud of skittish fear and silence. <br /><br />Because behind him, emergency vehicles, news vans from across the country and beyond, teams of scientists and government officials ringed the crater that was downtown Karakura like a lei of flashing sirens and shifting panic around a corpse's neck. <br /><br />One side fretful silence, behind was constrained chaos. If Ichigo wasn't so busy in his navel gazing, he might've found a metaphor somewhere in the comparison. <br /><br />So it was how Kurosaki Ichigo caught the last dawn of his living existence. <br /><br />He walked the familiar path an hour ago, feet barely registering the well-remembered landmarks. The juts of the stone and the brittle shale that lined the walkways between tombstones. He was sitting down before his mother's grave before he was even aware of it, staring a the engraved lines of his family's name. A numb little voice whispers to him that in a few days, his name will join hers here. <br /><br /><em>Would this be easier if I thought you were in Soul Society waiting for me, Mom?</em><br /><br />&quot;Ichi-nii!&quot;<br /><br />Four little arms snake around his shoulders and neck and he goes tumbling over on his back as his sisters descend on him in a way that he associated with his father and 7:00 am screw kicks and hideous paisley socks in his face. A wild thought flicks through him, wondering if he was witnessing a family trait that somehow by passed him. He forces down the pang of regret, there was no way he would actually miss those wake up calls. Or that bed and that alarm clock or Kon's screaming...<br /><br />&quot;Don't go, Ichi-nii...&quot; Yuzu pleaded. Over the weeks and months of continual exposure to such high level spiritual power, Yuzu's weak, dormant abilities were blown wide awake. She saw her first hollow, jaws first, as it swooped down to devour her whole. She'd sobbed in their father's lap for hours afterward and in quiet corners for weeks. It still tore at Ichigo's heart that of all the people he should be able to spare the hideous pain of this war, Yuzu should've been that one.<br /><br />&quot;Do you really have to leave?&quot; Karin hiccuped into his shoulder, shifting back only to rub at her puffy, red eyes. Such a head strong girl, just like her brother. The thought warmed him for a moment and brought him enough courage to smile for them. <br /><br />&quot;I have to go, you know what happens if I stay too long.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;But... you're a shinigmi! Shouldn't you...&quot; Yuzu scrubbed her nose. &quot;You should stay here!&quot; Ichigo pulled both his sisters close again, if only to hide the pain that wracked his face as they sobbed new tears into his kosode. <br /><br />&quot;I'm not going to be gone long, you know that right? I'll be back soon. This is just to make sure that nothing goes wrong.&quot; <br /><br /><em>Like my hollow taking over and turning me into a monster again, or losing my mind, or just becoming a regular hollow... </em>So many &quot;what ifs&quot; and unknown territory made this more than necessary, despite the sickeningly cheerful offer from Kurotsuchi Mayuri to hold out and &quot;see what happens, for the sake of science!&quot; He stroked the back of Yuzu's brown-blonde hair and held his sisters as they sobbed out their fears and worries on his shoulders. Thats what a big brother was supposed to do. Guilt pinged through him again.<br /><br />&quot;W-We know,&quot; Karin wheezed wetly between dwindling sobs. &quot;Rukia-nee told us this was just a precaution and its stupid but we still have to pretend that you're gone forever and...&quot; her eyes cut to the family tombstone and the blank granite where his name would be carved tomorrow. &quot;It sucks, okay?!&quot;<br /><br />As if naming her summoned her, a cool breeze of new reiatsu brushed against his sweaty neck and the sound of shunpo dropped Rukia behind him at a respectable distance. She stayed down at the base of the hill behind him and stood as stoic as a guard, as if warding off any interruptions with her stiff posture and utter silence. <br /><br />&quot;Rukia-neeeeee!&quot; Yuzu and Karin started sprinting down the hill to her, nearly tackling her legs out from under her. Ichigo almost laughed as both girls latched on to her waist and burrowed into the ring of her arms as she kneeled down and tried to soothe them. She spoke in low tones, too low of Ichigo to make out, but her face was gentle as she rubbed their backs and lifted their chins to meet her eye to eye. <br /><br />&quot;She's a good third daughter,&quot; Isshin quipped. Ichigo was surprised to see a cigarette dangle in his fingers, the scent of cloves and the curl of smoke like insense in the early morning graveyard. &quot;Glad she's the one here to do this.&quot;<br /><br />Ichigo said nothing. Isshin exhaled a long gout of smoke. <br /><br />&quot;So when are you going to ask her out?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;D-D-DAD!&quot; He was up on his feet and hands fisting into the absurd white and red striped shirt and shaking his stupid, stupid father and trying to avoid the lit end of the cigarette getting in his face. &quot;You moron! What the hell kind of father asks that kind of question at a time like this!?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hey! Karin and Yuzu are wondering too!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;THAT'S NOT THE POINT!&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I'm a man thats looking at the crest of the hill of his youth! It natural for me to want my only son put into good hands and on his way to providing me grandbabies! At least I have an option with you, Karin and Yuzu are going to require years of searching for the perfect husbands!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;YOU'RE A SHINIGAMI!&quot; Ichigo roared. At the base of the hill, all three girls watched them, bug eyed. Isshin just grinned and made a drag on his cigarette. <br /><br />&quot;Your point?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;THE POINT?! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'VE GOT LIKE A THOUSAND YEARS AHEAD OF YOU!&quot; The shaking started to slow. <br /><br />&quot;And...?&quot;<br /><br />Slowing. &quot;And you can go...to and from Soul Society...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And...right.&quot; The shaking stopped. <br /><br />&quot;Its okay, son. You're just not used to the perspective.&quot; A careful pat on the shoulder as he tapped out the ashes on the pathway. &quot;You'll be in Soul Society for a few days, maybe a week tops! Use the time to rest up and sneak a snuggle with Rukia-chaaaa--ULK!&quot; Isshin nearly inhaled the filter and last inch of his smoke as his son buried his fist into his gut. Both fuming, Ichigo turned around at looked back down the hill to see Rukia and his sisters scaling up to meet them. Both of the twins eyes were clear, the redness starting to fade at the creases. <br /><br />He locked eyes with her, frowning slightly at the bandages that peeked from beneath her bangs and the long sleeve of her shihakusho. She ignored his roving stare and disapproving frown. Her injuries were light compared to some that survived through the botched casting of the Ouken, but the sight of those bandages dug at him. <br /><br />&quot;Old man, what did you say this time?&quot; Karin snapped her arms akimbo to her chest as Yuzu delicately plucked the cigarette from her father's mouth and stomped it out on the flagstones, patting his back as he continued to hack his lungs out. The smell made her scrunch her face up in disdain. <br /><br />And like that, the heavy pressure that weighted his heart down dispelled, like steam released from a sudden cleft in the earth. <br /><br />&quot;We need to get going,&quot; Rukia whispered to him. Turning, he saw the faintest smile curve her lips up. Looking back at Karin continually fuss at their father as Yuzu tried to soothe her, he felt his lips turn up too. <br /><br />Its a matter of perspective, huh?<br /><br />&quot;Ahh.&quot; Clearing his throat, he walked up and without warning, scooped Karin into a king-sized noogie. Squawking, Karin wriggled and fussed and shouted at him while Yuzu got the same treatment in the form of an intense hair ruffle that had her squealing. The sibling tussling continued for a good long minute before he let them go, his own head not having escaped untarnished. Both were puffing and their hair sticking up at odd angles, and Karin had a magnificent scowl on her face. Ichigo took a moment to take them both in, standing beside his father. His sisters, no longer crying. Yeah, this is what a big brother does - dry the tears and replace them with smiles. <br /><br />Rukia wordlessly drew Sode no Shirayuki out and both of them broke back to Ichigo, crawling on him in a tangled hug. Another embrace that lasted for several long seconds before breaking, and when it did, Yuzu flashed him a broad smile. <br /><br />&quot;Ganbatte, Ichi-nii!&quot;<br /><br />Karin gave him a mock punch on the shoulder. &quot;Kick some butt, Ichi-nii.&quot;<br /><br />He smiled, his heart light and soaring from the release of his sorrow. He smoothed their hair out as an apology. &quot;You bet. You two keep Goat Chin in line, alright?&quot;<br /><br />Taking that as his queue, Isshin dropped back on his son, howling to the sky that his son has grown up now and becoming a man, moving out and experiencing the world for himself! Another violent bout of wrestling before Isshin pulled his eldest close and hugged him tight. His dad smelled of his cigarette, of antiseptic, his godawful cologne and Yuzu's breakfast. Ichigo found himself returning the hug before he realized it. <br /><br />&quot;Keep yourself in one piece, alright?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hnn.&quot;<br /><br />He turned to Rukia. &quot;I'm ready.&quot;<br /><br />The bare steel of Sode no Shirayuki caught the mid-morning light, the gleam collecting on the cutting edge. Rukia lifted the blade and the glint scattered into prisms dancing over the quiet tombstones and coloring the air. <br /><br />&quot;Head directly to Seireitei, there will be a captain waiting for you at whatever gate you arrive at.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Got it. Hit me.&quot;<br /><br />She swung the blade down. <br /><br />His family watched as his toes, his ankles and knees sunk into the pool of pale blue light. His face looked serene, peaceful even, as the view of his body vanished. The first flutter of black wings broke the quiet as his soul fled this world on its way to the next, sins of this life cleansed away as the butterfly became an invisible spec lost to the sky. <br /><br />&quot;Bye, Ichi-nii!&quot; Yuzu waved both her arms. <br /><br />&quot;Later Ichi-nii! Don't do anything stupid!&quot; Karin called into the cone of her hands. Isshin watched, a quiet smile on his face. He watched as Rukia sheathed her blade. <br /><br />&quot;Take care of him, third daughter?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Of course, uncle.&quot;<br /><br />===<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;That BITCH! She did not have to konso me that hard!&quot; Ichigo rubbed his sore forehead as he stomped towards the white walls of Seireitei. &nbsp;</lj-cut>"

Instead of &quot;contract&quot; we have &quot;purchasing significant amounts of stock in&quot;. &nbsp;Which makes it even worse and more unlikely we'll see any significant changes in the current iteration of the cross-posting tech. Especially in light of the thousands and thousands of new <strike>moneybuckets&nbsp;</strike> accounts that have been created on LJ from FB users flocking over.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lets face it, this is a game of LJ gaining more than they lose. Despite the fact that fandom and fandom-related things make up a significant amount of LJs users right now, LJ stands to get a hell of a lot more from FB. They know that fandom and people who post sensitive data here will be alienated, but they dont care. They get keg stand party girl pics and blurry camera phone in the mirror pics now!&nbsp;<br /><br />On the upswing, Dreamwidth's had over 20,000 accounts made in the last two days. If this keeps going on, I'm heading over to pastures that actually has a fence not riddled with dollar bill shaped holes.&nbsp;"

"event","Fuck you, Harry Reid. 

So the Dems back down on pushing the Climate Bill through the Senate because of the GOP filibuster. Because centrist Dems won't support a comprehensive climate bill with teeth. Because too many our Congressmen/women, despite the Gulf Spill, still can't find their testicles or ovaries because the oil companies have them in a ziplock bag in their briefcases. Because the Democrats lack the guts to push the Republicans and push hard. Even if the filibuster worked - MAKE THEM TAKE A PUBLIC STAND ON THE BILL. You have a goddamned American public outraged over the million plus gallons of oil still floating in the Gulf of Mexico. You have elections that are projected to be very bad for your party coming up. Instead of forcing a vote and making the GOP and the centrists reveal themselves for the oil corporation shills they are (and thus having hefty ammo to level in August), you roll over and conceed and try to push a watered down, piss assed bill that does nothing and upsets no one except the people that realize that climate changes are at the back of nearly every major global problem right now. 

But supporting green energy, putting caps on carbon emissions and does absolutely nothing (again) to finance clean energy implementation and research puts BP and its buddies profit margins at risk. And we can't have that. 

This is why I hate the current political parties - the GOP is a morally repugnant bunch of hypocrites and the Dems are spineless, weak-willed, limp-wristed cowards too afraid to play political hardball. 

Fuck, what I would give for a three-party system."

"event","So Karenai is doing Bleach, Ballad is doing FMA, so I might as well bandwagon myself and talk about The Dresden Files. <br /><br />I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS SERIES ENOUGH. ITS BRILLIANT. THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING AND HUMAN AND SYMPATHETIC AND JIM BUTCHER IS A FANTASTIC AUTHOR. <br /><br />Day One: Favorite Character<br /><br /><strong>Karin Murphy. </strong><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""My tastes are at least consistent""><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.sealdesigns.net/images/murphy.jpg"" /><br /><br />As TV Trophes so eloquently says: the scariest mortal in a fist fight is five feet and one hundred pounds. <br /><br />Karin Murphy is, at the start of the series, the lieutenant in charge of Chicago PD's Special Investigations Unit. SI, being the department in charge of investigating &quot;mysterious happenings&quot;, is the force's dumping ground for its disgraced and politically soured officers, a dead end assignment where they stick people to slowly rot for the rest of their careers. Despite this, Karin takes her job seriously and has the gumption to go find and put on retainer the only wizard in the phone book - Harry Dresden. <br /><br />Chicago is filled with supernatural horrors, something that Harry tries to keep Murphy away from for the first few books and for good reason. This leads to a lot of conflict between her and Harry. He withholds information from her and not only does she (rightfully) suspect him being involved with murder and other various crimes, but she actively arrests him for obstructing justice. This kind of conflict continues between the two of them for the first four books until <em>Summer Knight</em> when Harry takes the plunge and clues Karrin in to the truth of the supernatural world. From then on, Karrin becomes one of the few people Harry can consistently rely on as both friend and ally against the things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />She also has a romantic fling with a half-demon scion and hitman/assassin. He gives her a pink Kalashnikov as a gift thats engraved with &quot;We'll always have Hawaii&quot;. Beats the pants off a piece of jewelry. <br /><br />Karrin, above all, is dedicated to the law and her oath to defend Chicago, despite her being conflicted between the letter of the law and the spirit of it. Many times she has abandoned her duties as an officer to help Harry and has suffered for it. She was demoted from lieutenant to sergeant and lost command of SI because she helped Harry invade the heart of the Winter Court of Faerie's stronghold to rescue his apprentice. She pretty much lost her career altogether in <em>Changes </em>due to political maneuverings by a personal enemy within the department when she went to Mexico to prevent Harry's family from being completely wiped out. <br /><br />Karrin is also still a normal human, duking it out and holding her own against monsters that could easily slaughter her. She takes a chainsaw to <em>an ogres leg</em>, fights off the mental slavery of the King of the White Court, goes toe-to-toe with the upper echelons of the Red Court and one-hit kills a Lord of the Outer Night, drives off a Fallen Angel, survives a literal mind rape (a lesson that some elements of the Bleach fandom could learn from) by an Outsider, goes tromping through the palace of the Queen of the Winter Court, and pretty much has a Crowning Moment of Awesome every book and is only getting more badass as the series progresses. She got a job offer <em>from God himself</em> to become one of his chosen soldiers, for the love of Pete. <br /><br />Did I mention that Murphy, in addition to many of the other characters, displays the rare affliction of making use of important information? She answers strangers at her door with a gun and a crucifix. She melted down her deceased aunt's silver earrings to make bullets to take down a psycho werewolf. <br /><br /><strike>And no, I don't compare Harry and Murphy to Ichigo and Rukia all the time, what are you talking about?</strike><br /><br />Above all, Murphy is loyal to her ideals and her personal oaths before anything else. She believes in justice, both the kind that protects the innocent and punishes the guilty, even if the law sometimes gets in the way it. This makes her morally ambiguous, almost more so than Harry sometimes, and a complex character. <br /><br />1. Your favorite character.&nbsp; <br /><b>2.  Your least  favorite character.</b><br />3.

"event","[Standard political yarns within, potentially trigger happy subject, etc.]<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""And here we go. "">First thing I will complain about is a find on Youtube by a guildmate of mine: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGylifV03E&amp;feature=related"">Female Orgasm and Sexuality</a>. (Warning, NSFW - duh)<br /><br />First thing we get is a lovely picture of two women in the throes of passion. Lovely, maybe this is a lesbian sharing her secre....<br /><br />Oh. No, of course not. Its a video thats not even about a woman's orgasm, but instead how women incite &quot;sperm wars&quot; (raise your hand if that immediately made you start laughing) with other men. Its all pretty much how women decide the direction of the species by choosing who they sleep with. And until society at large started caring about bloodlines and the child's paternity started mattering more than the child's health and happiness, this was the case. In fact, I would wager this happens in nature a lot, seeing as how males are the ones who go through complex courtship rituals to impress females. But already we're moving into slut shaming territory, because women are trying to control the species through sex, you see. Then we get flashed a pie chart about how only 1% of sperm are actually meant for fertilization. The rest are &quot;warrior sperm&quot; meant to combat other men's sperm in the uterus. <br /><br />Now, also consider the bar chart we're given that demonstrates that <strong><u><em>80% of women</em></u></strong> have sex with a different man within five days of a sexual encounter.&nbsp;<br /><br />What. No, no. A survey said this, so it must automatically be true. Because most of the female population in whatever ubiquitous area of the world this study was conducted in do nothing but sleep around. Such dubious data was already making my eyes twitch, but where the fail is is in the comments. Among which is praise for Islam for keeping their women pure, for making sleeping around on their husbands such a grievous sin they would never consider it, why someone doesn't want to marry in this country (and feed the sex slave trade in Russia by ordering a Russian bride? By staying single forever? Either way, score one for American women, one more douche out of the pool), etc. But nothing embodies the egocentric, misogynistic, male dominance fantasy of the virgin bridge more than this:<br /><br /> 		<div class=""metadata""><div><a title=""diablo22900"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/diablo22900"" class=""author"">diablo22900</a></div> 			<div><span class=""time""><br /></span></div></div> 		  				 					<em>And that's the problem. Western women by nature are promiscuous,  and it's highly accepted. As opposed to more traditional countries where  being a slut is absolutely unheard of. It's rather sad really, to know  that some other dude/dudes has been in your wife or girlfriend and this  is just the norm. Blah......</em><br /><br />Its so good to know that your future wife or girlfriend will know that, as she's sitting on your tiny dick, that her sexual history before she knew you is subject to your scorn and judgment while how many women you've fucked in the past is not a factor. Because you are not deemed &quot;used goods&quot; because you decided to have sex with someone else before. <br /><br />Tell me, women of my flist, just how accepted being promiscuous is outside the hyper sexualized culture of music videos, MTV, and general media. You know, how people actually react to the idea that a woman may have a complex sexual history that involves more than one man? Who here would rather remain &quot;pure&quot; by living in &quot;traditional countries&quot; where our rights as human beings are non-existent and we are seen as a universal burden to father and husband that must be cared and provided for because we do not possess dicks that qualifies us for important things like religious and civil leadership and warfare?<br /><br />==<br /><br />Second issue on the docket: since when did being in the military qualify you to be a better politician than someone who didn't?<br /><br />Im really curious, because being election season, we see no end of American flag backgrounds, PACs smearing opponents, and candidates loudly and proudly proclaiming to be both Good Christians and Good Military Men/Women/Wives. Honestly, does your faith and past service make you somehow more equipped to meet the horrifically complicated demands of being a political leader? We know it doesn't make you more honest, thats for sure. <br /><br />I guess Im a bit bitter, because being decidedly non-Christian, I would never see any significant political office. <br /><br />==<br /><br />Most Libertarians irritate the fuck outta me when they talk politics. Because most Libs aren't really Lib's, they just like the idea of not paying taxes and diminishing government to a near useless weed-and-glue structure there to officiate current trends in thought and creed. <br /><br />Because real Libs like Rand Paul say things that are so fucking mind-boggling that nobody with a lick of sense would want to claim to be a Lib. Take his Libertarian view on <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/5/20/102050/902?detail=f"">interracial dating</a>. <p>PAUL: Well, I think it's interesting because the debate involves more  than just that, because the debate also involves a lot of court cases  with regard to the commerce clause. <strong>For example, right now, many  states and many gun organizations are saying they have a right to carry  a gun in a public restaurant because a public restaurant is not a  private restaurant. Therefore, they have a right to carry their gun in  there and that the restaurant has no right to have rules to their  restaurant.</strong></p>  <p><strong>So, you see how this could be turned on many liberal  observers who want to excoriate me on this.</strong> Then to be  consistent, they'd have to say, oh, well, yes, absolutely, you've got  your right to carry your gun anywhere because it`s a public place. <br /><br />Digest that for a moment, folks. He's trying to equate racial discrimination with carrying a loaded gun into a McDonalds. <br /><br />This is Libertarianism.</p></lj-cut><p><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","This is what several decades of pro-industrial deregulation has gotten us. <br /><br />BP has been dumping a chemical soup called Corexit into the Gulf. It supposed to break up the massive oil slicks into tiny little oil slicks and make it sink into the bottom of the ocean. While this would keep the oil from coming ashore, it would certainly not do shit for keeping the oil out of the <em>actual ocean</em>, or continuing to poison the wildlife. <br /><br />However, the big problem with Corexit is...we can't make them tell us whats in it. <br /><br />Thats right, the barrels and barrels of complex hydrocarbons and hell knows what else that we're dumping into one of the most economically and ecologically important oceanic systems in the US, that will probably continue to pollute the waters for decades...we don't know whats in it. <em><strong>And we can't make them tell us whats in it, or make them stop using it. </strong></em><br /><br />Yeah, read that right. EPA told BP to stop using Corexit because it was too toxic, gave them a day to find an alternate solution and three days to enact it. BP's response?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.hotindienews.com/2010/05/24/1024245""><i>&quot;We are continuing to use Corexit while we look at other  alternatives.&quot;</i> - Mark Salt.</a><br /><br />Call me a paranoid, whacked out enviro-nazi (a lovely term that has been belched out by some narmy Conservative talking head for the people who are all a flutter about a silly little oil spill. It hasn't caught on, because Nazi is <a href=""http://www.indecisionforever.com/2010/05/28/right-wing-radio-host-offers-startling-revelation-about-adolf-hitlers-gayness-that-nobody-else-has-ever-heard-of/"">the term they're using for homosexuals</a>.) but this is what we've been warned about for years out of watch groups and people with enough sense to not trust an organization whose sole reason for existing is making more money. And the oil industry has the government's shriveled testicles in a little ziploc baggie, so don't expect Obama, Congress, or any governmental body with actual power (since we declawed, neutered, and hacked off the limbs of the EPA) to do shit about it."

"event","&quot;So what did we learn today, folks?&quot;

&quot;I learned how to imply someone is a fornicator of sheep in three languages, sir!&quot;

&quot;I was asking about the boss, Lam.&quot;

&quot;I learned that Blood Queen Lana'thel does not wear panties, sir.&quot;

&quot;Lam, shut your cock holster before the only thing you'll be able to see is the label of your own underwear.&quot;

&quot;I respectfully point out that as a Forsaken, I dont think I bother with underwear, sir. Uhh...ma'am.&quot;

&quot;That was Kalrad talking, Lam.&quot;

&quot;...What did I do wrong, then?&quot;

Times Kalrad has been mistaken for being a woman on ventrilo: 14. 

Wipes on Blood Queen Lana'thel: 17

Seconds it took for Lamnent to be kicked out of guild for that joke: 4.7

Lamnent wondering aloud in vent why he couldnt use guild repair: priceless. 

For raid strategies and mature people there's Tankspot, but for serenades of Led Zepplin songs, trains in backgrounds, sexy dancing orcs and trolls, Kiwis and Aussies arguing over hockey, bribes for misdirects, learning to get your back to the wall if Kalrad smiles at you, hunter/warloc hybrid babies, Power Ranger sound boards, inappropriate use of jetpacks on trees, epic speeches, Team Green domination of Recount, wasted Fish Feasts to screw with the shadow priest, SPIDERS&nbsp;ON&nbsp;FIRE, bubbles, Mel Brooks shout outs, mouthy Southern Belles, Bragg's many illegitimate children by every female raid boss in the game AND Jaeger, a walking reference of sexual depravities and more than one reference to someone's &quot;Iron Dragon&quot;, there's [H] Condottieri, Moon Guard, NA."

Work like you don't need the money.
Love like you've never been hurt.
Dance like nobody's watching.
-- Unknown

You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get
yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days
is to go about repeating the very phrases which our
founding fathers used in the struggle for independence.
-- C.A. Beard 

As nightfall does not come at once, neither does oppression.
In both instances, there's a twilight where everything remains seemingly unchanged,
and it is in such twilight that we must be aware of change in the air, however slight,
lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.
-- Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas

We can have justice whenever those who have not been injured
by injustice are as outraged by it as those who have been.
--Solon (594 B.C.)

The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by
the Prohibition law, for nothing is more destructive of respect for the
government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.
--Albert Einstein, My First Impression of the U.S.A, 1921"

"event","ok, now it's just getting annoying, i need to talk to my boss. i was supposed to work this morning from like 9:30 to 2, and then i would have to go straight to school and pretty much stay there from when i get there until 9 because i have class 3-4 and 6-9 and it's not even worth going home because it takes me a half hour unless if i take the bus (and i dont feel like biking there during rush hour)

so anyways. i did all my homework last night and stayed home and didnt do anything with anyone and went to bed at like 1am (kinda early) because i thought i had work this morning, then he never called or showed up so i sat around all morning doing nothing because noones around and i did all my homework last night. i did get a nice amount of reading in, i finished a book (<i>wampeters, foma & granfalloons</i> by kurt vonnegut) and started reading <i>fear and loathing in las vegas</i> finally, i was looking to get a copy of that book for so long, and finally bought it with my college books off the internet. so i guess it's not a total waste, but i'm still annoyed with my boss cause he does that a lot. also because i really need to work now because of the huge ticket i got. i don't know how much it is, i should really call the number on it and find out though.

oh well. i'll live =P"

afternoon itinerary:

a) play final fantasy VII for an hour or so

b) read kurt vonnegut

c) play sad sad songs on the guitar

d) drink? wander? something else?

there isnt a sad enough song for today. all these things i've felt but not been bothered by because they were just in my head i read in a book of things written almost 40 years ago. we're so fucked, everyone is so fucked, there's nothing really left to do. i guess.

this morning i got up at like 11 and rode my bike home and showered and stuff and went to normandale to get my ID. I was gonna get a bus pass but I guess they don't work yet so I have to go back monday. I'm really excited, I'll be able to take any bus anywhere whenever I want for $70 a semester.

"event","sorry its been a while, ive been feeling like shit

ummmm,

today i realized that my family doesnt really like me, ive known my whole life that my dad hates me, but today i was thinking and like i cant even talk to them anymore, cause my little brother is my little brother and, my mom is mad about everything i do. like this morning i even got out of bed when she told me to and had an extra half hour to get ready for church and she seemed just pissed off about the other times i havent made it, then i asked 'why have we had the same cereal for 3 weeks?' cause we have like 10 boxes of that strawberry shit and like basic 4, neither of which i can even stomach anymore, they both get stuck in my teeth like mad and just make me sick if i eat them in the morning. well she got all mad and was like 'cause you dont eat the cereal we have', neither of which i can eat but she didnt seem much like she cared, (apologies for my bitching) but anyways thats the general feeling i get around my family, ive been not good enough for my dad since as long as i can remember, for as long as i can remember ive been out of shape and dont eat right, hes been calling me fat and weak since like 2nd grade :\

i was thinking a while back, what if i was dead like in the 6th sense movie, and im just imagining myself here, and it probably would work out too, except for one thing, its rather depressing but the one reasong that i know im still alive and such is because so many people hate me. but oh well at least im not nonexistant, oh wait, wouldnt that be better? meh, you tell me.... oh well.

my dad quit his fuckin job and last friday was his last day, now hell be home all the fuckin time, hell probably still be the only one who can spend the fuckin money even though my mom will be wasting it all, i hate it, he wastes all our money on stupid shit, like model airplanes and new computers, and he takes like (honestly) a hundred vitamins a day and eats out all the fuckin time. ive been to hawaii 4 times but im not getting any money at all for college, hes also never home, hes at work or running or tanning, but im glad. just an idea of how much this will suck, for a while this year when i get home from school i would get on the net and do shit till my mom got home, sit around till my dad gets home, start sleeping so he can bother me, get up in time for my internet, lay around the house (or just sleep some more?) untill they go to bed and then go on the net again until really late (or just watch tv) because i cant stand wasting time that i have alone, i get like 4 or 5 hours of sleep a night. now hes gonna take the time im home after school to and im gonna just die or something. hes like a fuckin cleaning nazi, i have to clean all the hair and piss off the bathroom floors everyweek with windex and paper towels. but i dont feel like bitching anymore.

i had something more to say but now i forgot, oh well it was just gonna be mroe shit anyways

IM REALLY SORRY FOR ALL MY BITCHING, I REALLY AM HONESTLY!!! 
it makes me feel so guilty i hate it oh god i hate how much i hate myself i dont even deserve to do that"

LOL dude if you wanna be nonconformist you gotta drink coffee. that was the best southpark episode ever (i dont know if it says too much though) i dunno i think its time for me to leave, so for the 3 of you who i told about this and maybe the 1? of you (if that) that reads this, peace out, and sorry for my bitching (as for you whom i told about this directly dont think any of the bad stuff is for you, its not theres nothing i think badly about any of you, please dont take offense at my thoughts)"

lately i feel like shit, i dont know if its just that i dont really sleep much (4-5 hours a night) or that just everything sucks, i think its both. im so lonely :\ tonight everyone i was talking to had to leave within like 2 minutes of when i started talking online. but i really generally am mad at me so much lately. like ive been told a so many times just to shut up and stop my bitching, thats the thing i hate most about how sad i am, is that im not supposed to be and people and even i get mad at me for it. thats why im doin this shit i dont feel like bitching to cara tonight or any of my other non existant friends. i also have noticed that more and more whenever i say something it either offends/angers/annoys someone, just in general thats how it is. and many times in a day i just get shit like ""shut the fuck up you fucking retard everyone hates you get away"" but oh well :\ just a few days ago i was talking to this one dude who lives in like pakistan, he asks me hows life, i say 'not much is going on' he asks again, i dont want to mention the terrible depression and shit so i just say 'i havent been doing much, mostly school' he asks what im doing, i tell him just about the 4 projects all due in the same week and how ive not been sleeping, he tells me his schedule and then yells at me 'bullshit your enjoying life! you pig, i wish i had a life like yours' blah blah, i pretty much couldnt talk there anymore, someone comes in says 'sup?' him: 'oh not much you better talk to poor old bob there' *evil glare* yeah i didnt like that :| i know i bitch too much i thought that before people told me that, and even when people said it was ok when i apologized but now all my paranoias are becoming true. i thought about it and realized it would be much simpler if i just died before i got to college, my parents are already bitching about SAT and such and saying i gotta take a class for the fuckin PSAT, that would solve that, and the whole needing a job thing wouldnt be a problem. i guess the only thing missing is the will to die, or at least the will to put up with the shit from people, which i guess wouldnt be a problem but lucky me i dont like pissing people off, that would just be another way to fail at life so prolly not. but yeah i think thats good for right now :P

"event","wow, im actually bored enough as to start a journal lol whatever just dont tell anyone lol. i guess its better this way, bitching to the interweb rather than annoying some poor person , but oh well. im getting really tired now but i dont want to go to sleep because then id have to go to school sooner, when you always get up at the same time it seems like going to bed early is just throwing hours of your life away, i havent been to bed before 12 in a few weeks and before 1 in at least one week. someone got really mad that i had the quote ""WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"" in my profile, i dont know why she got so mad i spent like 20 minutes explaining the meaning, then she just lost interest and left lol. my tummy hurts too but meh, i dont know how to fix it :P im starting to think i shouldnt have even bothered as im not gonna write anything worth while. maybe tomorow ill feel differently if i remember i started this thing :P"

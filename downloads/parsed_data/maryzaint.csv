Looks like Xtina and I may treck out there early saturday just to get a sugar rush! I know I'm not going to be eating breakfast that day! ;)
[speaking of god... the movie Religulous with Bill Maher was awesome btw!]


Touching on a much different topic, I totally have a crush on a boy. He makes me feel like I've got a high school crush all over again,and makes me really nervous, but fortunately I dont think he see's the nervousness cause I cover it up with stupid random things that come out of my mouth. He probably thinks I have tourettes or something haha.
He seems suuupah sweet, which means there's probably something wrong with him, like he's secretly a homicidal maniac, or into beastiality or something. I dont think there's such a thing as a truly 'nice guy', if so, i have yet to meet him!
With all my bad luck with guys I am very reluctant. Whatever. Either way, at least I've got an awesome new friend.


On a more touchy subject for me, tomorow would have been Kenny's birthday. Either today or tomorow I plan on going to the cemetery after work to take him some orchids. It's only been a few months since his passing, and I still sometimes get the urge to call his cell phone. Errrrgh!
I miss him.

jackie and i at some fancy smancy overpriced vegetarian place called <a href=""http://www.fattyscafe.com/"">Fatty's and Co.</a> most dissapointing vege eatery ever! very few vegan options. They had all this damn fondue, and NO vegan fondue. Most vege places have lots of vegan crap. bastards! teases! :\

On a side note, my bro <a href=""http://ramonmedellin.com/"">Ramon</a> is finally an official memeber of the <a href=""www.magiccastle.com/"">Magic Castle</a>. It's about time, I dont know what he was afraid of! He performed in front of board members and they loved him. No surprise there! :) So proud of him. he was recently on Sabado Gigante doing a balloon scupture fasion show, and now I found out he's being flown out in a few months to Germany to perform out there. Bastard. I am a tad jelous. :) I wanna hide in his bag and go with him!

Im going to annoy the hell out of Ray, I cant wait! Muahaha! I also need $ to get my hair fixed [i look like trash with a faded caca hawk], I think manny talked me into dreds. We shall see. ;) Need even more money for a party I plan on having next month, as well as for a <a href=""www.luchavavoom.com/"">Lucha Vavoom</a> which happens to fall on my birthday this year! Whoot!

In other news, Luz is having a 80's prom horror theme birthday party next week and I'm assigned to be ""the cheerleader"". That bitch. I bet she thinks thats is SOOOO funny. So i gotta find some tacky ass outfit and a wig that makes me look like a dumb jocks' whore. I should get some pompoms and throw them at her face :P Either way, the party should be fun. I found some outfits and ideas randomly googling and I think I have an idea of what sort of outfit im going to get....

"event","I want to kill myspace. I've been locked out of my account for sometime now. My account got hacked and someone changed my password and i cant have my password sent to my email. It doesnt work. Blah. Annoying. I dont miss the site, but I know my lazy ass friends rely on that site to contact me instead of calling my damn cell phone.
Anyhow. Not much exitement going on in my life lately. These long days pretty much constist of slowly killing my soul at this stupid job, drinking ale and watching stupid ass american idol with eric and linsay [which is actually fun since we talk alot of shit ;)], hanging out here and there with John, Neyney, and Willie, playing too many video games, and occasionally harassing Scott and making him watch musicals and cheesy documentaries with me... the poor bastard.
There are only a couple of things worth talking about. Had a few buddies over for game night last week. It consisted of way too much alcohol, and we played cranium and humdinger. It was fun! Next time my corny ass wants to play Clue. :P
Also last month [or two], worth speaking about was the <a href=""www.ministrymusic.org"">Ministry</a> show. Scootster and I got VIP tickets, cause we are nerds. We were to get some cheesy goody bag, get to hang with the band for an hour before the show, and yadda yadda yadda. The ""hang out"" was from 7-8, we got there about 7:30 and they told us it was too late and wouldnt let us in. Bastards! I was so pissed. So we sat around for a while in the dinner room and got some crappy food, and weak drinks. The first band Hemlock went on, and they were terrible! Aghh! Meshuggah went on after, and they did an awesome performance. The new songs especially sounded great! Since that stupid location {house of blues hollywood} doesnt offer VIP seating like the Anaheim one does, we snuck into the ""red rope"" area, a section roped off for family and friends of the band, and for people in the industry [i guess music labels and other bands and some other bs]. We were in there for some time till the chick regulating the area noticed us, and realized we didnt have wristbands for that area. When she approached us, i informed her about my bitterness with the venue giving us crap and not letting us in when they were supposed to before the show, and the chick said she would let us stay, and she handed us wristbands. Muahahahaaa! It was probably because I looked like a sad child. lol anyhow. So there we are chilling enjoying ministry's TWO AND A HALF HOUR SET! whooohooo! Danny was there and he was all trashed and running around. Also bumped into Jessica from Cent. Media as well. Got to briefly hang with Ohgr [of <a href=""skinnypuppy.com"">skinny puppy</a>], who was very drunk, and very silly. :) At some point during the show, Porn model/fetish model <a href=""www.myspace.com/masuimi_max "">Masuimi Max</a> approached me, asked my name, and was telling me how adorable she thought I was. HAHAAAAAA sweet! Masuimi Max thinks I'm adorable! Here's a big ""FUCK YOU"" and ""NEENER NEENER"" to all my pervo male friends that have the hots for her! :D Anyhow. After talking with her, and being all flattered and cocky for a moment, I got a photo with her, as she smooshed her boobies at me. o_0 Got some silly pics with Ohgr as well. ;) So all around, despite the horrible beginnings, it was a great show, had some good drinks, and got to hang out with some awesome people. :D

"event","I'm stoked!
My bro Ramon bought tickets for us, including Mr. Dylan-caca for <a href=""http://luchavavoom.com/opening.html"">LUCHA VAVOOM!</a>
I'm especially looking forward to seeing ""dirty sanchez""! LOL
<img src=""http://luchavavoom.com/luchadores/dirtysanchez/images/dirtysanchezpage_09.jpg"">
I hear the ""crazy chickens"" are pretty rad as well.

There are strip teases and chicks in thongs and tassels too apparently, but seriously, with cheesy mexican wrestlers [some of which are women and midgets], who cares about the half naked people! :D

I plan on getting nice and roudy tonight. Let's hope I dont get into a little wrestling myself!

On another note, The Murakami exhibit was awesome. However I didnt predict waiting in line for an hour or so to get in. We were rushed out of there after 45 minutes or so. Didnt get to see the Louie V. exhibit, but I could care less, I hate designer bags anyhow. 

Bunker was dissapointing. Otto was awesome and I was enjoying myself along with many others, when in the middle of his set Frank started DJing. There was a lot of arguing and finger pointing, and some people knocked over monitors intentionally. Chaos! That whole situation left a really bad taste in my mouth. Clubs are starting to get dissapointing, even Bunker. :\

Oooog! Time to clock out! LUCHA VA VOOM TIME SUCKAHHHHSSS!"

"event","Random thought: After seeing too many japanese films and anime movies, I realized little white panties are sexier than any kind of thong or other kind of underwear. Anime chicks and Japanese girls in movies always have the little white panties! Always! There's just a cute sexual innocence about it.... damn I sound creepy! Regardless, I've always hated thongs. Anyone who says they are comfortable is full of shite! They make you feel like you constantly have something riding up your ass, which you do, and how can that be comfortable? More like akward and distracting! :D
I say no to thongs! Haha!

I saw Cloverfeild the other night. It was awesome, but not a movie you want to watch when you're not feeling so well. It made me dizzy and nauseated :P It was worth it though.

I'm looking forward to this weekend! <a href=""http://www.ottovonschirach.com"">Otto Von Schirach</a> is performing at <a href=""http://www.dasbunker.org"">Das Bunker</a>, and he always does an awesome show! Never thought I'd see the day he would be performing there though. I'm used to seeing him at Drum'n'Bass events. Scott and hopefully Dylan as well will be dragged along with me. After, motel party with Monique and Kristie. Yayyyyy! Have not been to a ghetto momo party in years! :) Saturday I think I'm going clubbing with my cousin for his birthday or something. I need to find him a nice slutty rockabilly chick so he can get laid. Hehehe. Fucking greasy butter-head he is!

I've been so bored at our downtimes at work lately I do a lot of online window shopping, and man is it depressing! So many nice things I cant convince myself I can afford. Maybe if I cancelled my netflix account, and stop buying food I like and isntead just eat tofu and veggies every day, then I can afford stuff. Stupid car payments and expensive vegan diet! >:\

"event","I really want to go to the <a href=""http://www.takashimurakami.com"">Takashi Murakami</a> exhibit in LA. I could care less about <a href=""http://www.louisvuitton.com"">Louis Vuitton</a>, but I love his other non related artwork. The exhibit goes on till Feb., hopefully I can get myself up at a decent hour on the weekend for a change, and force myself to drive out there. I havent been to any art shows since the <a href=""http://www.markryden.com/"">Mark Ryden</a> exhibit in Pasadena 3 or so years ago. How pathetic is that!
<br>
In other events. Since I've been working <a href=""http://www.att.com"">here</a> [a year and a half now], I've been getting made fun of for being vegan. Such as the time my team had a meeting and they ordered delivery pizza for everyone and my manager was nice enough to get me a salad. When my coworker Nick [who i love to death but he's a bit of an bitch sometimes too!] showed up with a handfull of fresh lawn grass on a plate announcing my salad had arrived. Ass!
Some of my other co workers annoyingly ask constantly what I am eating and what is it made out of, and they joke about how everything I eat is made of cardboard. It's getting real old, real quick.
Today I made a batch of 24 vegan cupcakes and brought them to work and they dissapeared quickly. All those same morons are ranting and raving about how good the cupcakes were, then I told them the fearful news, THEY WERE VEGAN! ;) Jerkholes.
<br>
Bahhh even though the pay is nice, I'm looking for another job. I dont need to deal with the occasional customers abusive language. A guy I talked to earlier called me a ""fucking bitch"" and an ""ugly cunt"" how would he know if Im ugly anyway? he cant see me! I bet he's just bitter cause his wife looks like a Sasquatch! :P Anyhow, I was asking him to please be respectful and talk to me in a professional manner, as I was with him. He just kept flipping out, like a maniac. All this over him having delinquent payments. Why should I suffer because the ass cant pay his bills on time? GRRRR! I felt my blood boil and for 20 minutes after that, the temperature seemed to rise 10 degrees in here. >:\
<br>
2 more hours and Im out of here for the day. The weekend is comming but not soon enough. Tonight Im going to treat my pops and Scott to a nice homecooked dinner before I finish doing voiceovers for a cheesy commercial. ;)
<br>
p.s. Bauhaus apparently has a new [last?] album coming out this march! :D

"event","hmmm. wow.
it just took me 10 minutes to eplain to a customer how to spell ""independence parkway"" and ""TEXAS"", so she can mail something to our corporate shipment center. I had to spell ""texas"" for her 3 times, and the word ""independence"" probably 15 or so times.
WOW.
She also ended up wanting to talk to someone else because she claimed she couldnt understand the way I talk. She mumbled something about an accent. Ummmm what? If you know me, you know I speak perfect clear english. I dont have any accent. If anything I might have a hint of stupid fucking valley girl in my voice, but that's about it. Haha.
It was so strange though. I asked if she could hear me alright, because I would say things like ""N as in Nancy"" and she would say something completely different, like ""What? P?"" Oh my god.

I should not be at work today. I'm not feeling well, and they made us come in 2 hours earlier because of the holiday. So tired! All my friends are in Big Bear right now having fun at a cabin, I'm supposed to be there. :\ Might go later but not 100% sure. I dont know, staying overnight in a 3 bedroom cabin with 15 other people doesnt sound tooooo appealing.

I have no idea why we are fully staffed at work today. There are about 30 people sitting around right now picking their butts and noses because no customers are calling in. I could be on my way to fresh air in the damn mountains right now. Bastards.
And now I'm getting cramps. GRREEATTTT. This is a lame fucking way to start off the new year. It's going to be a bitter night.....

Everyone is giddy today but me I guess, how annoying! I hate it when I'm bitter and everyone else is fanfuckingtastic! Bastards! All of you!"

"event","Oh man, I am in love with netflix. Greatest thing since sliced bread! I've watched at least 100 movies or so since I created my account, and most of them awesome.

I keep noticing <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hairspray/70065096?trkid=214017"">Hairspray</a> moving up on my que, and I keep bumping it back. Being a HUGE John Waters fan, I'm very hesitant to watch a recent remake of the classic, now starring John travolta in place of divine, Queen Latifah [what?!?? I hate her!], Christopher Walken, and that little annoying bitch Amanda Bynes. The only person I would ever imagine in any John Waters story would be Christopher Walken. I'm just worried that the whole significance might be lost in the film, because when I saw the commercials it looked like a fucking Disney movie. :\
Anyone seen it, who's also a fan of the original? What do you think?
I just hate when a fav childhood movie is re-done and ends up stinking like a fresh cut turd [example: spiderman, superman, batman; the later films, hulk, etc.]

I did watch a few great ones lately though. Such as ""<a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Your_Mommy_Kills_Animals/70073060?trkid=190393"">Your Mommy kills animals</a>"", which is a documentary that explores why apparently the FBI calling the animal rights movement the No. 1 domestic terrorist threat. Hey also discuss animal rights activists, and organizations such as PETA, and ALF [animal liberation front; which is a much more aggressive group], etc. It kept me interested the whole way through.

""<a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/This_Film_Is_Not_Yet_Rated/70043954?trkid=190393"">Then there was This film is Not Yet Rated</a>"", which mostly questions if certain movie studios get preferential treatment, exposes the discrepancies in how the MPAA views sex and violence, and reveals the association's efforts to control culture. This one was also pleasantly sarcastic, and had me giggling and intrigued. ;)

""<a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Paragraph_175/60002225?trkid=190393"">Paragraph 175</a>"" was just sad. A good movie, but depressing. Another documentary, this one about Homosexuals in Germany during WWII, and what they went through at that time because of their sexuality.

""<a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Noam_Chomsky_Rebel_Without_a_Pause/70028148?trkid=190393"">Noam Chomsky; Rebel without a Pause</a>"", where the MIT professor/political analyst discusses his views on 9/11 and the after effects, media manipulation, the US ""war on terrorism"", etc.

""<a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Thin/70043832?trkid=90529"">Thin</a>"", I watched last night which was another depressing documentary. It was just so very sad! The camera follows around a selected group of girls/women while they undergo treatment for eating disorders. The youngest girl being 15 who was in the hospital multiple times and was having kidney problems because of her disorder, and didnt want any help or treatment. Each woman has her own story there, some have had suicide attemps, some  with children, etc. At the end of the movie, they of coruse do a brief follow up on the 4 main women.

I think I'm going to lay off the documentaries for a bit though, and watch some Anime. ;) I still cant beleive I havent seen Vampire Hunter D! What the hell is wrong with me!

"event","My moods have been oh so strange lately.
I am begining to wonder if I ever really knew what real happiness feels like.
Every once in a while I'll feel what I think is happiness but it fades so quickly.
I'm just struggling right now trying to figure out what I need in my life to be satisfied, not only satisfied, but ""happy"".
Do I need to finally start my own business, which I've been contemplating for years? Will that make me appreciate life more, or make me more bitter and stressed?
Do I need to travel and experience other things and places? Maybe that will help. Who knows?
I've been extra moody and emotional the past few months. I cant help but wonder if most people feel this way, or if it's just my chemical imbalance?
The different meds my neurologist gave me recently dont work well for me. They either trigger my anxiety, or make me a restless insomniac. I cant deal with that.

Linh recently moved to Seattle. I miss him already. He wants me to go visit him soon. I think I should. Maybe I just need to get away for a little while, from everyone and everything. Maybe I'll come back feeling fresh and new.
I havent travelled anywhere since New York a couple of years ago.
Bleh.

I need to find something fun to do tonight. Preferrably something, different."

Your ruling planet the Moon is currently in a very harmonious relationship with Mercury. This means that you will be feeling in a romantic frame of mind throughout the day. You are usually quite shy when it comes to romance, but today you should break that habit and just let someone special know exactly how you feel.

Today's Chinese Proverb:
""You can outdistance that which is running after you, but not what is running inside you."" 
Today's Motivational Quote:
Four innate sentiments dispose people to a universal moral sense. These are sympathy, fairness, self-control and duty.  
-- James Q Wilson 

And now I'm back to being utterly bored again.

Your help is needed now! Join thousands of volunteers and collect signatures from registered California voters all over the state beginning this October.  The Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act is not an online petition.   The California Secretary of State requires actual signatures of registered California voters.

Friday I was lazy after work and just knocked out around 10 pm.
Saturday was lazy all day after running lots of errands, and headed out to Dylan's to go to Eterno to see the Deadfly Ensemble with he and his chick friend. I got totally sloshed and let him drive me car. He and Danny were buying me drinks all night after I already had a bunch of vodka. :P

It was fun, there were lots of familiar faces I was happy to see, and met some great new people too. Dylan made me dance with him in the industrial room. Then I was later dragged onto the dance floor by Ralph.
I shouldnt dance when I'm drunk. I bet I looked like a cripped bird or something.

The next day I was sooooo very hungover, went to a neat vegan place in Silverlake with that jerk Danny. The food was great, and I realized I have a new obsession called <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v612/zaint25/four/kombucha.jpg"">Kombucha</a>!!!! :P MmmmmM!

Later after many hours had passed, and my terrible hangover passed, I went to Dylan's for a pumkin carving party/b-day party for his roomie. It was fun! Loud rap music, fun lil' gay boys everywhere, lot's of booze & food, bull dogs whos faces i wanted to chew on, and pumpkins!!!

And now for my pride and joy.
BEHOLD! My penis pumpkin!

Yep it's great to know they're taking him out to bars and strip clubs. Wonderful. And it's even better when he text messages me just to let me know about each and every one of these events. Fabulous!

It bothers the hell out of me.

I recently realized I dont know how to handle <i>being friends</i> with people anymore.

Why are californians so obsessed over douchebags like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.
""Oh shit look B. Spears flashed her dirty crotch!"" ""Woah Paris Hilton was being irresponsible and got a DUI!"" Then people act surprised!
All of a sudden a celeb so much as farts and it's on the news for the next 3 days.
It makes me wonder if news casts in other states are the same way, or if it's just like this in L.A.
I hope people dont care <i>this</i> much about movie stars, pop stars and ugly bitches [that are famous because mommy and daddy are rich] everywhere, because if so, that says a lot about us.
How sad most people tend to care more about celeb gossip than they do their own lives, or more important matters in general.

On a more pleasant [or possibly non pleasant] note....
I soooo want to go check out the Golden Girls Gone Wild gallery.
See <a href=""http://defamer.com/hollywood/defamer-partywatch/the-golden-gals-gone-wild-opening-at-the-world-of-wonder-gallery-289020.php"">here</a> and <a href=""http://laist.com/2007/08/12/golden_girls_go.php"">here</a>. :D

We're completely clueless where we'll end up though, since, well, we dont go camping! :)
We're looking to stay in so cal in a forrest or a beach, doesnt matter.
So far recomended... angeles national forest, Malibu[on the beach], Santa Fe Dam camp site, DeAnza Springs in san diego.
Anyone know of any other neat places that are tent friendly?"

I do beleive the final draft is done and I'm stoked about it.
I asked him to do an H.R. Giger take of sorts on the Guadalupe with Invazer Zim-esque tubes to wrap arouond my arm.
It looks amazing.
Only thing is It might be TOO much detail for a tattoo artist, but I'm sure they can make some slight modifications to make it tattoo friendly.
Now I just need to decide on the exact face.....

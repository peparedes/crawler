"event","This is the holiday thingy!!!


What I want for Christmas:
1. ANYTHING .hack// (Dot Hack) related
2. A life
3. A girlfriend would be nice... T_T
4. A box of Life cereal. (No, seriously. I love Life cereal.)
5. A PS3!!!!
6. $100


I got this from hightrance_play and shuntress_rikku

Step One

- Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, or link to this post (it'll be public) so that the holiday joy will spread.

Step Two

- Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special."

"event","Okay, So, I have lots of things to say. Of course, a lot of it will probably be one or two sentences long each.

-I gots trillian pro bout a month-month and a half back. Trillian Pro is the version that your NORMALLY would hafta pay for... If ya catch mah drift. ;D
-Kat and I broke up.
-I hafta clean up my house by next semester so as I can bring Chas over so as I can help her to pass all of her classes... XD  I don't mind it, that much, though.
-My Algebra II Program is going to drive me insane. (Yes, more so than I ALREADY am)
-Stupid WinAmp won't continue on to the next song in mah playlist. In any of mah playlists, fer that matter. *Glares at WinAmp* ~___~
-I swear I'm NOT downloading The Matrix Revolutions... >_>;
-Moose
-In Marching Band, we got 3rd place in our Class, and were a 4th place overall finalist in the BOA Atlanta SuperRegional. There were bout 48 other bands there. This means that we are the 4th best Marching band in the entire South Eastern United States. Eat that, Kennessaw bitches.      ^.^
-MOOSE, DAMN YOU!!!!!

And now, yet another imaginary hypothetical conversation with my TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator:

Me: Damnit! Why won't my Algebra II program work?!?!?!
TI-83 Plus: Dude, we've already been through this. I'm Satan.
Me: You're right, we have been through this. You are NOT Satan. You are a TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator that is POSESSED by Satan, but you are not Satan himself.
TI: Well, technically I am.
Me: How so?!
TI: Because.
Me: Oh. Okay. Hey! I found where I messed up! *fixes error* There we go!
TI: D'OH!
Me: Haha.
*???: Holy Crap!!!! My leg is on fire!!!! DEAR GOD!!! SOMEONE SAVE ME!!!
Me: *Looks over* *Sees sephiroth* ... Haha!
Sephiroth: It's not funny!!!! It really hurts!!! And I can't even put it out!!!!!
Cloud: Hold on! I'll go get something!
Sephiroth: Hurry!!!
Cloud: *Comes back with a marshmallow on the end of a stick* *Holds it in front of Sephiroth's leg* *Eats marshmallow once cooked*
Sephiroth: Oh come on!!! I let you sleep with my girlfriend!!! Please help me!!!
Cloud: Oh, all right. *Walks off* *Comes back with bottle of water* *Hands it to Spehiroth* Here ya go.
Sephiroth: Oh thank-god!!! Thank you SOOOOoooo much!!!! *Opens bottle*
Cloud: *Takes a step backwards*
**Sephiroth: *Explodes*
THE END

*Note: This starts at the scene when Sephiroth is walking through the fire of the village that he burned down.
**Note: Cloud replaced the water in the bottle with Kerosene."

TODAY, however... >_<;;;
I went to the dentist fer a cleaning and a sealing. Guess what? they found a cavity. >_____<; in my less-than-a-year-old molar. >________<; They say there's something wrong with the enamel. Instead of the sealing, job, however, I got a filling put in. Now I can't feel the left side of my face. after they got the filling in, before it dried, they had to drill part of it back out, and refill it again, so as I could floss. >__________<;;;;;;; Needless to say, the second time around it hurt like hell.

I FINALLY passed CIA Rave on FFR. I did it during Web Page design. (My computer at home lags so much, i doubt it can go 2 minutes w/o lagging. and When it does lag while I'm play CIA Rave, by the time it's done lagging, I have already failed teh song. XDDDDDD) And get this! I managed to pass it not once, but TWICE!!!! HELL YEAH! and I talked to the dude who made the song. I talked to him on AIM, that is. and he sent me CIA Rave and Frozen Embers. 8-0 He's freakin awesome.

I kinda want to type this LJ, and then I don't.
It's gonna have a skit in it. And that's why I don't... And do.
I dont like all the typing. It takes too long. XDDDD

ANYways... Yeah. Sooo.. I programmed in 2 games into my calculator so far this year. (Yes, I programmed them myself). Please don't ask me how. Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand. Needless to say, one is what i call the ""Cave Game"" in which you are placed in a situation where you are in a cave, and you must try to find the right path that will lead you out alive. o.O;
The other one is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. XXDDDDDDDD I'm not quite done, yet, 'cause i hafta finish making the graphics for the title screen. They are kinda starting to get annoying. But nevertheless fun.

Hrrmmm... almost all of the songs that I love to play on FFR are now too boring. Not enough challenge. So, I'ma do what I did with Sonic Boss Machine back when i was newb. Only I'm going to do it with CIA Rave instead. Like SBM was to me back then what CIA Rave is to me now (impossible), i shall play it multiple times when I can. Until I actually pass it. 8-0 Then I will improve upon that score until I inevitably surpass Lisa in FFR skills. o.O


Okay, so, I hafta admit, I kinda lied.(sp) 
There is no skit.
I couldn't think of one.
:P

What are you still doing here??
::viewer:: I'm waiting for this entry to finish. So as I can get back to my life.

-I just got back from marching-band-camp.
-I now have god-like calf-muscles.
-I can march and play the entire opener of our show.
-Stupid Drum Major Jeremy won't stop calling me 'Clown' and 'Clown Boy' because on wednesday, i forgot my next set, and because of that, i was 5 yards off my dot and i looked lost while out on the field. Mr. Petway said over the stadium speakers ""Matt, You gave me a great idea for the show. We're going to put a clown in it that will be lost and it will be hillarious. You could even be that clown. Matt, you marched that set so poorly, that it was funny."" I myself thought it was hillarious. I also thought it was hillarious when the Tuba section did there skit on Skit Night about ""Highlights from Band Camp This Year"". They imitated me being lost and they had their fattest dude dress up like Mr. Petway (who is, btw, our band director) and repeated everything that he had said to me.
-Colton Teefy found Rhinocerous(sp?) beetle outside which was dead, but only from the inside. It's whole outer body was still completely normal. So Mr. Cowden (Our sectionals teacher) had left his note book on the pool table (we had our sectionals in the rec. room) but hee wasnt inn there, so Colton put the beetle in Mr. Cowden's notbook, and Mr. Cowden opened it up while sitting on the pool table next to it, did a double-take, and freaked and jumped up. It was freakin hillarious.
-I'm a total Band-Geek. :P

Ummm... Pretty much that's it. :P"

This bitchy and stupid girl woke up, andwas like 'what are we doing?' her friend (also bitchy and stupid), said 'we're watching cirque du solei cause the teachers not in the room' The first bitchy girl (g1) said ""what? Why?"" So I said, ""just go back to sleep"" She threw a fucking lotion bottle at me! XD It hit me in the face!!!! XDD I was mad, and this fucking queer Taylor (not really gay, but prbly is) quickly snatched it up off the floor b4 i could grab it. (wtf?!) I said, ""Taylor, give it to me!"" and he gave it to the girl behind me. Every1 thought I was going to throw it back at her. Nope. Im better than that. The teacher had left the door open. That thing was going into the fucking hallway with the cap open. But alas, I couldn't. By then, I had gotten out my metal ruler in hopes of blocking anything else she wanted to throw at me. The next was a goddamned dry-erase marker, which i didn't see coming, and barely missed my skull. (fer a dumass, she sdure as hell has good aim!). So then I called her a slut and she said 'are you talking to me!?"" and I said ""no"" not wanting her to fucking start a fight. (referrals carry over into next year at my school) (I also would've been out fer at least a month at Central Alternative). After she went back to her seat, I said ""hehe, dumass' which, apparently she heard. She picked up an eraser fer the dry-erase markers and threw it at me. I flung my hand up to block and ended up hitting the back of my hand as it was raising, and promptly ricocheted into *2* ppl behind me, thus making them pissed off at her fer throwing it.  :twisted: 

Im still planning on placing rotted fish under paylor bed at Band Camp later on this summer fer not giving me tht f***ing bottle.

Also, it would be nice to know how to do LJ Cuts. If someone (who isn't Lisa) could, tell me how to do them. I don't give a damn if ur a total stranger, just fucking tell me how!!!! XDDDDDDD"

"event","Well, last night, my computer crashed twice, so I was like, 'fuck this!' So I went to play Area 51 online.

I went into my clan's game (=EK=) and they kept kicking me and banning me from their games. So, I was like 'Fuck this!' and I quit their clan. After that, I went and tried out fer the 187's. I think I might have made it. I'm not sure. I'll find out later. Like at about 3:00 am when I finally decide to get back on. or sooner. yeah. Probably sooner.

So, after that, I went back into the EK's game and said ""Hey, umm, guys. Yeah. I just wanted to let you all know, that I fucking quit EK's. Yeah. You can all rott in hell. Fucking cocksuckers"" and then I left before they kould kick and ban me (again). bwahahaha. It made me feel good about myself.

I also found out that the tip to my headset is bendable.

That was last night. Yesterday afternoon, I went to blockbuster to trade out Jak I fer Jak II. It's teh awesomeness. I get guns, and I kan high-jack vehicles, and if i'm unlucky, I high-jack a troop-dude's vehicle by mistake, and then I hafta fly as if my life depended on it. ... Which, by then, it did. >>; So, I would get a big, burly vehicle, and slam the smaller ones head on. Mine wouldn't take hardly any damage, and the dude on the other, smaller one, would be dead. And if mine evar blew up, I would just promptly steal someone else's. ^.^ I love commiting grand-theft auto. ^.^ Just not the game. I don't really stay into stat-builders. So, yeah.

Ima go now."

"event",":9~~~~  Milky Way bars. I had 2 different dreams last night that were based on those oh-so delicious bars... :9~~~ So, I went out today and bought a whole bunch!!! okay, here's the one I remember the most:

It was at school, where the vending machines are. They had just installed a BUNCH of cameras around the school, 3 of which were in the vending machine area. Think the LCD projectors with a deep red lens, and the ability to move around, by that, I mean motorized, yet mounted on the wall. Okay, stay with me here, were the entrance to the junior building would normally be, there was a wall with a camera. That pathay, against the wall, on the side, there was a vending machine on top of something... apparently the door was open, well, able to be opened, but I left it closed, since there were *2* cameras trained on me. I had been at that one machine fer about an hour, and still didn't have enough change. XD Eventually, I decided I would have to steal it. But b4 I decided how to do so, I woke up... >_< So, I went out and spent $5.44 on Milky Way bars. 3 regulars, and a bag of a bunch of Midnight Milky Way miniatures. XDDD Well, some of that 5 dollah *Okay, actually most* was spent on mango-flavored Sobe energy drink. Mmmmmmm... :9 Nothing beats anything with a picture of a lizard or gecko on it! ^.^

In other news, I'm going out with Sarah now! ^.^ *Is happy* *Feels loved*"

I've lost all hope in Chas...
I also have a very sore throat because of whatever is pollinating today that WASN'T yesterday. If someone could tell me what that is, it would be really helpful.
Umm... I'm thinkin bout onvertin my old, plastic ""25-in-1"" pool table into a Poker table...
I also learnt how to shuffle differntly today. I'm developing quite rapidly at it.
It's strange how I can suck at computer programming, and still want to be a programmer, yet, I am awesome at writing, yet despise it, and am awesome at anything having to do with cards that DOESN'T have the word ""Magic"" in it, yet still want to be a programmer. I guess it's more cause I love video games so much. But I also love programming. I figure that if my plan to become a video-game programmer ever falls through, then I could become a professional Dealer at Vegas. Then again, probably not at Vegas, since I don't want to really live there. I guess I would want to work in a less *metropolis* like city. Hm...

Also also, while at home, I did away with AIM and just downloaded trillian instead. XD It's teh awesomest. It keeps me from having to download AIM, MSN, YIM, and ICQ messengers seperately.

Anyways, lastnight the clock got set forward by an hour. o_o; therefore, I shall be referring to all times as they were withOUT the time change.


I got up over at mah Grandparents' house at around 4 a.m. so as I could go fishin wit mah Uncle Tony an Lake Lanier. I had never been to Lake Lanier before. Unfortunately, the dam had a new turbine they had just got online and spent all day testing it. o_o; That meant, the water was too high and turbulent to catch any fish. The trout are lazy. They don't like moving water. XDDDDD So, from 6:45 a.m. (adjusted ahead one hour), till 12:30 p.m., we fished. It is a lot more fun than I remebered. XDD Although, those damn crawdads on the river bed, would come out from under their rocks, grab ur bait, and drag it under their rock, thus causing it to get stuck. XDDDDDDDD;;; So, at one point, we ran out of hooks and had to go buy some more. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD  In the end, we caught nutin, and still had fun. ('cept fer Tony, who had jus blown $50 fer the equipment. XD)


Also, It appears as though lock-in starts in an hour at teh mall, so I must leave you to go eat. XDD

*screen saver mode*
Okay, Today during Science class, there was a sub. Apparently there was a sub yesterday, too. Also apparently, Mah science teacher's mouse died over the weekend. Also also apparently, it was very stinky. XD So, the sub told Miles*** to *throw* the mouse out the window. XD also also also apparently, he was supposed to throw it *past* the fence. Well, he didnt. XDDD It landed on the concrete pad below, near by the library. XDDDDDDDDDDDD
*Still in screen saver*

*save the screens!*
Also, I doubt I'm gonna participate in the AWA Cosplay contest this year. I'm prbly gonna participate next year. I also highly doubt I will have *all* of mah costume done by the time that *this* AWA rolls around...
*Screen Savers! (teh movie XDDD)*

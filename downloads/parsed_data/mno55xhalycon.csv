You possess enough inner security to deal with your<br>partner having a life of his/her own.  You are<br>able to tackle the occassional jealous twinge<br>by inviting a 'rival' to dinner instead of<br>making a fuss.<br><Br>
Nothing can rattle the strong lover.  You have<br>developed a kind of inner courage that allows<br>you to deal with your difficulties without<br>getting upset and lets you provide a shoulder<br>to cry on when things get tough.  Best of all,<br>you are unlikely to get jealous about either<br>petty things or real infidelities.  This<br>doesn't mean that your partner can et away with<br>lying and cheating.  Instead, you might simply<br>pack your bags one day and walk out the door.<br>If this happens your lover could discover that<br>he/she has lost a solid and reliable partner,<br>someone well worth holding on to.  But then,<br>the strong silent type isn't neccessarily<br>everyone's cup of tea.  In bed you are not<br>overtly wild and explicit, but your lover can<br>sense deep currents of passion that flow<br>beneath the surface.  The understated can be<br>very erotic in its own right - this is your<br>appeal.

Your ability to be supportive and friendly inspires<br>warmth and loyalty in return.  And you are<br>mature enough to see that even if you love<br>someone you shouldn't step in and do<br>everything. <br><br>
Alot of people adore a supportive lover like you<br>because your genuine thoughtfulness and the<br>actions you take on behalf of your lover make<br>you a wonderful and valuable partner.  But<br>beware of being taken for granted, and be<br>careful of stifling others by being too eager<br>to help.  Also, the supportive lover is very<br>likely to be strong on skills such as empathy,<br>and probably also has that rare talent, the<br>ability to know when a lover needs to be left<br>alone, which is vital if you are to avoid being<br>overly controlling.  If you are a supportive<br>lover, then your personality profile is one of<br>the most mature.  Your empathy and<br>understanding translate into the bedroom to<br>make a really sensitive and responsive lover<br>who knows all the right moves to make without<br>being told - a most valuable skill indeed!

NONE, and i repeat NONE of the people in edina share interests at the same level as i do. scott, you're the exception, but you don't live here anymore obviously (but hell, you're still even my best friend). i wish i had a group of friends that was like you and i are. i dunno, we just have a great time and we get along so well. well we're both highly addicted to AvP2 also :P so that might have a wee bit to do with it. but i have hope for college, i think people are gonna get a lot more mature and all will be well (or at least better). on another note, i miss tiffany. a lot. it's only been 2 days haha, but still, i won't get to talk to her for another 2. i'm such a damn hyprocrite and i feel kinda stupid for having an online relationship, but i've come to the conclusion that i don't give a fuck anymore. honestly, i'm happier with tiffany than i've ever been with any girlfriends i've had that live near me, and i think that says a lot. and it's not like we don't know eachother, we talk at least every other day for a long ass time, and every time it only gets better. think whatever you want, that it's lame or anything like that, but it's not to me. anyhow, i gotta get goin cuz i have a meeting at church for my ethiopian project. peace."

AP calc BC can kiss my ass, and so can mr woelber. anyone who's reading this is probably laughing because i'm pissed off at something so piddly, but this is the single class i wanted to do well in (i wanna major in mechanical engineering, so math is very very important to me) and i'm gettin like 50%'s on tests and shit. granted, a 50% in that class is worth a C, but fuck that! 50%!! that's terrible! anyhow, i'm off to bed to calm down. bitch bitch bitch, moan moan moan... i know. but oh well, that's what a journal can be for. peace."

"event","i went to iowa state this past weekend to check it out, and i knew this before, but i realized it more than ever this time: iowa consists of corn, corn, corn, corn, and flat land, flat land, flat land, and flat land. it was a cool school though, the campus is awesome. my cousin and i tagged along to a party with his friend (which was great fun, drunk people are funny to watch). i can't wait till tiff and i can live together when college finally rolls around. i swear, every day it gets worse. i think more and more about her, and i go more and more crazy wishing i could see her. i would be happy seeing her for like 2 seconds, just as long as i got to see her in person. i keep seeing this couple at school that for some reason strikes me as how tiffany and i would be. they're always walkin together, holdin hands, the guy's a skater, and i don't really know much else why it reminds me of us, but it does. every time i see em i think of tiffany and i and just wish i could be with her doing that kinda stuff, the simplest things. i wanna know what it's like to kiss her, hold her hand, hug her, hold her, see her smile and laugh, all of those things. i wanna know all of her little habits, good and bad, all of her friends, what her typical day's like, and the list goes on. it sounds kinda stalker-ish, but it's really not at all, it's just curiosity and love for her, and i know she feels the same way (so if you think it IS stalker-ish, well then at least it's mutual). on another note, i wish it would just snow dammit. i've been watchin snowboarding videos almost daily now (about 3 of them over and over.... would you guess that i'm addicted?), and i'm going crazy wishing snow was here. i'm feelin good about it this year, like i'm gonna learn a lot of new tricks since i've gotten better at skateboarding (the skills obviously cross over). anyways, i'm tired, so i'm off to bed. if you're readin this tiff, i love you :) i'll be havin some mighty fine dreams"

"event","i can't frickin wait until i go to michigan tech (at least i hope i do) and live with tiffany... it's gonna be unreal. i'll have tiffany, snow, woods, lake superior, mountains, cold weather, fishing, everything i could possibly want, while designed and engineering things, working with engines and all that. heaven. i'm gettin really sick of school though, especially AP chemistry. i hate lab notebooks, they're stupid as hell. if i were a real chemist, then they, they make sense. i guess for me they don't make sense cuz engineering has nothing to do whatsoever with chem labs. oh well. i miss tiffany, but there's only like a month left till i get to see her. we probably will get to share a hotel room for a night, how cool would that be? i've never actually slept with a girl. i don't mean having sex, i mean just plain old sleeping. i wanna just lay there together with her and be able to see her and kiss her and all of that. it sounds kinda dumb, but that's what i want most right now. anyhow, i g2g to bed. haha.... wow. tiff, if you're readin this, check out the zoning out i did just now, lol. designed and engineering, and then they, they make sense. lol oh well. i miss you and i love you so much"

"event","it's the day after my birthday, but my mom actually celebrated it today... and you know what she gave me? 125 one dollar bills... in a frickin grocery bag, all scattered. lol i opened it up and saw all this cash just sittin in the bag like 2 inches deep and was like ""hehehehehe...."" so it was a good day, i'll be savin that money for a truck. i miss tiffany so much, we haven't been able to talk much at all lately, and this weekend i'm gonna be gone most of the time for homecoming, so that's even less than i get to talk to her. tonight's the homecoming game, that should be fun, and then tomorrow the afterparty is gonna be sweetness. i haven't written in awhile, so i figured i'd update this thing, but i'm pretty much done now. oh yeah, siddhartha is a crazy book... i like it though, it's definitely interesting. anyhow, i'm headin to the game, so adios (whoever that is?) tiff, if you read this, i love you and i miss you so much."

"event","i miss tiffany so damn much. this distance thing sucks butt, but i really don't care, i'm waitin it out. i can't even imagine how awesome it's gonna be when we're finally together in michigan or wherever it may be. i had this crazy dream last night... i was this little miniature person and me and my brother were fighting in the basement of some crazy room of a house that looked like blood gulch in halo.. there were like battecruisers from starcraft and scorpions from halo and tanks from battlefield 1942 and all this other shit that we were fighting in... lol i dunno, i have some weird dreams. next thing i know, i'm flying in the battlecruiser upstiars into this bedroom... the stairs are white and lit up with little light strips along the sides, and the room is all white too with a candle lighting it up. i saw the room and like right then, i half woke up and just started thinkin how i couldn't wait to have my own room like that with tiffany... just like in our song, the early november - just enough. kinda crazy, but i know stuff is gonna work out with us, we're too much alike for it not to. not only that, i have so much damn fun with her and she's just beautiful and damn, the whole package. i couldn't have asked for more, except for being able to see her sooner. a little over a month till i get to see her in florida, so i'm waitin for that. i love her so much. man, it's just gonna be perfect."

"event","black then white are all i see, in my infancy.
red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. 
lets me see.
as below, so above and beyond, i imagine
drawn beyond the lines of reason.

over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind,
withering my intuition, missing opportunities. and i must
feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.

black then white are all i see, in my infancy.
red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. 
lets me see there is so much more and
beckons me to look thru to these infinite possibilities.
as below, so above and beyond, i imagine
drawn outside the lines of reason.
push the envelope. watch it bend.

over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind,
withering my intuition leaving opportunities behind.
feed my will to feel this moment, urging me to cross the line.
reaching out to embrace the random. 
reaching out to embrace whatever may come.

i embrace my desire to
i embrace my desire to
feel the rhythm, to feel connected enough to step aside and weep like a widow
to feel inspired to fathom the power, to witness the beauty, 
to bathe in the fountain, 
to swing on the spiral 
to swing on the spiral 
to swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.

with my feet upon the ground, i move myeslf between the sounds and open wide to suck it in. 
i feel it move across my skin. 
i'm reaching up and reaching out. I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me,
what ever will bewilder me.
and following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.
we'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.
spiral out. keep going.
spiral out. keep going.
spiral out. keep going.
spiral out. keep going.
spiral out. keep going."

"event","i'm in this weird mood, and i don't know why. it's a really peaceful mood, real calm, but focused at the same time... i dunno what put me into it, but i like it. i had a pretty good day today i guess, maybe that did it, along with the cold. i went over to ben's house with ryan and we had some fun at the skatepark and caused some trouble in the neighborhood. nothin too much new since then, so until next time... peace"

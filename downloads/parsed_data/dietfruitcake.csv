"event","Well, I have decided to update. 

The past week has been ... crap, mostly. Except seeing Lia. That was really good.

The D of E hike was alright, although Lia dislocated her knee so she had to go home. After that it went bad, we had to walk through many creeks (wah, water) our instructor stuffed her ankle so we had to sit on the road for 4 hours, I stuffed my knee (though not as badly as Lia) and the other group finished 3 hours before us.
When I got home I had about 1 1/2 hours to have a shower and pack another bag for Coast Venture. Which I really didn't want to go to. We got to Lake Tabourie at 8 or 9 and I went straight to bed. I spent most of the next day being ignored by people, before being yelled at by the leaders (with everyone else in the troop) because Lauren overdosed on No-Doze or something like that and had to go to hospital. Stupid git.
After that, James decided to talk to me, but later in the tent I realized it was only because he wanted to fool around while his girlfriend wasn't around. Gah.

And after all that fun, guess what I'm doing next wekend?!

Thats right, Hiking. Blergh.

Anyway, today has been much better. Chris and his friend stayed home from school today because ... actually I don't know why. But they did. And they stole alcohol form the garage. It was really funny because they though they were being so cool and looked like morons!

I think thats about all I have to say for the time being. Boiye!"

"event","Well I got back from the counsellor about an hour ago, which was fun. I pretty much ignored her for the entire thing and then told her I didn't want to see her again. I feel kinda bad about being rude though.
I also want to say sorry about lunch, I'll try to not be such an attention seeker tomorrow."

anyways... i think that i am a horrible person because this girl i know is having a bday party like right now and im not there... i kinda like forgot about it and now i cant really get a ride to it because it started like 10 minutes ago... im such a beast... sorry... anyways... thanksgiving was good... i guess... i saw like my family and stuff... we ate dinner like 2 hours later than we planned on cuz my grandmother messed up when cooking the turkey so it had to be cooked for like two more hours... no big deal except that i was starving because i didnt eat at all before then, because i knew i would be eating a lot when i got there.. so yeah... i got to see my brother matt, and my little cousins ben and jacob... ben is three and a half and jacob is like nine months... oh yess... anyways... after that i saw my dad and that was pretty fun.. so overall it was a good day... today was like the day where i sat around and was lazy like forever... cuz im good like that... oooo kates online.. h/o i must talk to her... ok then all my plans are screwed right now... so yeah... i was planning on seeing her tomorrow and doing stuff but nevermind... whatever... i guess i will do nothing tomorrow... so yeah... i think i'll be seeing her on sunday though, and maybe saturday night... so i dont have anything to do tomorrow during the day... maybe brit will do something with me, but i doubt it, cuz she never has time to do anyuthing with me anymore... :( sadness... anyways... i dunno... whatever... i know that i need to like make a cake for that girl whose party i missed... so yeah... lol.. thats about all i have for plans! oh yeah... by the way HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAT!!!! lol... shes the best... hehehe... well i should go cuz i dont have anything else to say! lol... see ya!

"event","i got my report card, and let me just say that i am VERY pleased... except for the grade i got in mr. green's class.. hes a dinkis! well here they are:

American Literature: A-
-im sooo happy about this! like, i dont even work that hard in this class... we just like sit there and talk while the class has a ""discussion"", and i get a good grade. also, all of the essays and tests that we have had, have been EXTREMELY EASY! wOOt!

Algebra III/ Trigonometry: A-
-this is awesome, becuase not only do i not have mrs brown this year, i also am not getting a C- in math every term this year! ohhh yesss!!!

Chemistry: A-
-am i on a roll here or what? i LOVE this class! mrs cavanaugh is awesome! hehehe

Aviculture and Petshop Management: B+
pretty good for not teaching my bird anything the whole term, and also doing my log book like the day before it was due...

Marine Mammals: A-
-what can i say? im just the greatest... jk... this class was also easy...

Wild and Exotic Animals: C-
- now this is where i am confused... mr green has been giving like every person in our class a bad grade... do u think that he was in a bad mood while he was calculating them? thats my guess... he even failed Rob, who is like the only person who ever does anything in his class! i just dont get it... and also he like refuses to talk to anyone about their grades, probably because he knows that he screwed up big time, but whatever...

Business Management: B+
-this is great, because like the only thing that i do in this class is talk to johnny german online and talk to brit in class... its great... the only things that we've like actually dont in this class was update our work samples, layout, and put in some pictures for the portfolios... ohh yesss!!

well thats it... i got honor roll! i would have done better if mr green wasnt such an imbecile! i dont get him.. like whats his problem? i never even did bad on like any of his tests or anything... so i dunno... whatever... hes weird...

luv gardi (sarah)


ps- sorry erin that i stole ur idea, it was just a good one lol... i had to do it!!! hehehe"

is this thing scary or what? --> Do you feel as though you have a ""conscience"" or ""voice"" that tells you negative things about yourself, convinces you that you do not deserve to eat and/or to be happy, or that tells you that you are or deserve to be fat and ugly? 
thats like our inner men! oh my goodness... its like the exact description... scary, huh? well anyways... many scary things happened in the past few days... like... scary thing number one: some guy named Sergio IMed me and was like... hey i found ur profile and got to ur website... u are a very beautiful woman... and im like... what the crap? who are you? and hes like... im sergio from florida... i want to chat with interesting people... i saw your picture and u are good looking... and im like... what? oh my gosh... who the crap is this guy? so im like... how old are you? and hes like... 33, and im like... no thanks... ur old... and hes like... oh sorry bye... lol!!! im like... how scary is that??? anyways... i dont like the fact that old men can find my web site and like... see my picture and crap... i made my profile for my friends to look at, not perverted old guys... lol.. another scary thing that happened was just this period... ok i was like in the room that my study is in and like dougie bear was in there... and i had to like get this binder from the bookshelf that he was like standing next to... so i went over and as i was coming back, lakiesha and stacy were like laughing, and looked grossed out and like shocked.. so i was like... what??? and they were like... did u not notice that dougie bear was like an inch behind you??? and im like... ummm no... and stacyc was like... he was like.. wicked close to u and then started looking you up and down... and im like... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! thats like the scariest thing ever... i almost puked... like... what the crap??? arrgghhh... i wanna go puke right now sooo bad. so yeah.. im trying to think if anyone else scared me... ummmm... this kid at coffee house scared me... its this kid paul who is lonnies friend, and like the whole time me and kate were there, he was like... when u guys blah blah blah... its cute... like EVERYTHING that we did... hes like... its cute when u blah blah blah... and we're like... ok get away from us now... and he just kept doing it... we was like... i just broke up with my girl friend, any volunteers??? and we're like... ummm.. no... and he came up to me later and was lik... whats going on with ur hair? and im like... what? and hes like yeah its all different lengths, and im like yeah its layered... and hes like... yeah... its like longer in the back... and im like.. yeah its layered... lol... so hes like... oh dont worry i like it.. it looks cute like that... and im like... arrrrggghhhh!!! get me away from this guy... and this guy is like 25 or something... what is it with all these perverted old people scaring the crap out of me???? arrrggghhh!!! i just cant take it... its like leave me alone im 18.. u know what... not interested... lol... i dunno... i think thats all for now... if i think of anything else... i will update later...see ya!!!!

"event","so much stuff has happened... but its like basically nothing... like.... i dont even know anymore... whatever... so yeah... i dont remember the last time i updated... so whatever... well... i guess i'll start with monday... which was a very boring day... i dont think that anything really exciting or different happened... we went back to school and i got a ton of make-up work... dahhh i think i'm done with all of it now, except for the math test i'm taking tomorrow 2nd period... during my study!!! argghhh... i hate wasting my study... oh yeah we still have the substitute for marine mammal class... the guy is nuts... but whatever... i guess that the class watched Moby Dick and a movie called Revenge of the Whales while i was gone, and now we have to write a paper comparing them, and i only saw half of moby dick and none of the other movie... i dont know how he expects me to do the stupid paper... he was like... ask ur classmates about the movie... i dont think that they want to take the time to explain all the similarities between them to me... brit told me about them, but im still not sure if i will be able to compare and contrast the two... but i guess i will try... so yeah... tuesday was like... the day that i went with kate... kate picked me up from school and we went to her house... we watched the movie ""crybaby"" and it was hysterical... i think that my favorite part was when this guy was like bathing in a bucket thing, and he was like... ""u caught me in my birthday suit... butt naked!!!"" it was quite funny... i think thats like my favorite saying now... hehehe... then i met two of her friends and we all went to this young life thing... her friends were nice and i had a good time... i met this kid andrew that she knows and he reminds me so much of justin marotta that its just plain scary... oh man... anyways... yesterday was like... boring i guess... i went to a job interview for Linens n' things... it went ok i guess... but i dont know... im probably not going to get the job... cuz the guy said that he was going to interview like 4 more people for the same position and he is only going to hire one... so it probably wont be me... i dont even know if i want to get hired there anyways, cuz he seems like he will be mad at me or something if im not like ""what hes looking for"" and also i wnt to get the job at barnes and noble.. i hope i do, but i probably wont... whatever... after that, i went to help out at the girls club thing... it was good cuz cristine was there... that kid Jon like drove us crazy as always, and personally... im kinda freaked out by him... hahaha... yeah so that was good... today was a half day... YAY... i hate school... i just cant stand it... so yeah... we got out early and that was exciting... andrew and this kid bobby kept poking me on the bus and they wouldnt stop... i think i have like bruises now... so yeah... andrew was especially annoying today, i dont even know why... ut yeah he wouldnt leave anyone alone... at one point, dan says to me, ""can you tell your brother to let go of my hand???"" lol... it was like the funniest moment of my life.. oh yes it was... so yeah i think thats about it... i talked to johnny german today... whatta cool german... lol... oh man he cracks me up sometimes... so yeah tomorrow is friday, and i cant wait... cuz tonight i have to babysit and im actually really dreading it becuase i hate doing it... but tomorrow should be better, and maybe i will even get to see sellers for the first time in like a million years... so yeah sorry that i am writing so much... but thats all for now.. so see ya!!!

   I have been eating poetry.

   Her eyes are sad
   and she walks with her hands in her dress.
   
   The poems are gone.
   The light is dim.
   The dogs are on the basement stairs and coming up.
   
   Their eyeballs roll,
   their blond legs burn like brush.
   The poor librarian begins to stamp her feet and weep.
   
   She does not understand.
   When I get on my knees and lick her hand,
   she screams.
   
   I am a new man.
   I snarl at her and bark.
   I romp with joy in the bookish dark.

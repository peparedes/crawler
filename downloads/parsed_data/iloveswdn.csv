This is a very sad occurrence. What am I to do? Uh, apparently she does look at this journal, but she doesn't log in and post, or so she says. So, uh...hmm...

COMMENT AND TELL HER YOUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT HER. I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

XOXO
Alison

I am posting to let Kassy know that when she gets back, me and Ashley are planning a party for her return and her birthday!!!!! My best friend is about to turn 17, and we must celebrate it!!!!!!! So, if all of you on her friends list would like to wish her a happy early birthday, I'm sure she'd really appreciate it.

I LOVE KASSY!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","Hey everyone it's Alison again. I'm updating for Kassy because she never updates. It makes me sad, I'm sure all of you on her friends list are sad as well to lack the knowledge of Kassy's wonderful life. Speaking of which...I actually have no idea what's going on in Kassy's life right now, just that she is on the girls' soccer team and that she hasn't called me in fucking forever!!!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!! Ok I'm done. But seriously, call me. And update. So I don't have to keep doing it. LOL.

Alright everyone. Oh, btw, ENGLAND ROCKS! Best accents, music, humor, and how about British guys? Aren't they so fucking hot? If you did not answer yes then you are wrong. And shouldn't be reading this journal. So get the fuck off. I don't want Kassy associating with you. 

Haha sorry JK. But I &hearts; England. Anyone who knows me knows that.

Ok I'm done updating. Love to Kassy!"

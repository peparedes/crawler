"event","Kansas State Science Assessments...boy I hate standardized tests:(.  So today has been a very lackluster day.  Spanish was boring we went over the criteria for our outlines and went over our poems.  Math was trivial we had Mr. Godfry as a sub and well no one understood what he was talking about so I taught myself out of the book and talked to Kylie the rest of the hour.  I hung out with Billy for a little while after lunch and then came back to school for 4N6 and all I did there was find a new prose piece.  Now I'm in Chemistry taking the previously mentioned standardized test.  Oh joy.

Well our OM regional competition is Saturday.  We have no competition so we are pretty much guaranteed a trip to state on the 2nd of April. Our team performs at 9:30 am in Clifford Hope for anyone who is interested in going.  

Well this is getting progressively dull I think I'll go pick on Mitch some more."

"event","So I found out today that Ashley is coming to Garden in 18 days for debate.  I can't wait to see her.   I hardly get a chance to visit her when I go to Hays.  It's rather sad.

We had a test in math today and I think I did ok.  Better than I was expecting actually.  Afterschool my sister and I bought mac and cheese and came home and made it.  It was really good.  I sat down and ate that and studied for my test in Intro To Drama tonight.  I'm gunna need some prayers to pass that one.  Oh well.  
 
Guys honestly, I feel really alone.  It sucks being in love with someone you can't have for reasons beyond your control.

"event","Lately, my life has just been a mess of problems, worthless bullshit, and drama.  None of it worthy of posting.  So I'll spare you the agony and skip through all the events of past weeks.  

Yesterday was overall a good day.  Sarah and I drove around for a bit then I dropped her off after school.  Then I cleaned my room as so I could go out for the night.  At around 6, Sarah dropped by for a bit and I decided to leave with her.  I talked to several of the band kids and then met up with Breanna at the football game.  The football game was very fun.  I talked to alot of people I hadn't talked to in a while and had a great time.  After half time my interest in the game withered away so I went off to talk to some friends.  I saw Amadeus and Billy and decided to talk to them.  Hallie came up and we all sat there for a while.  My sister then came up and showed me this cockroach she had found.  She had it on a blanket.  Hallie told her to put it in someone's hair. So my sister decided her prey was going to be this girl who had been spreading rumors and saying shit about my sister.  The girl had no clue she had a bug in her hair for the most part and she still didn't when my sister and her friends walked away laughing.  It was great.   After the game, I came home and watched the party at Levi's house.  

Today, I plan to hang out with Billy for a bit.  The orginal plans were for Sarah, Billy, Alex and I to hang out.  But Sarah has to work and Alex well....he's just not coming.  So it's down to Billy and I.  That should be fun though.  After that I'm hanging out with Sarah. (hopefully if her mom isn't being stupid).  Oh well.

"event","I'd have to say I had a great ending to a terrible week. 

I had a great time last night.  I went out for dinner with Soren and his friend.  We went to Peking Garden and ate buffet.  It was pretty good.  Soren is a great guy.  When then went to the shop and talked to Tuan and Robert which was fun.  Then we all headed down to the river to see what was going on with the bonfire.  

We got there and only Nick and Kristen were there.  So we started to help them with the fire.  When we finally got that going more people showed up.  It was a great time.  I left for a bit with Robert and Nick to get some blankets to sit on.  We went back and there were a ton of people, but it was still boring.  So we went and drove around.  That was alot of fun.  Nicki and I did a chinese fire drill on Kansas and had a Great time.  Then we went out to Jennie Barker and Nicki and I played hopscotch and scared ourselfs.  Then I came home and ate:).  End of my night. 

Now I'm getting ready to go to Hays.  I'll update more tonight or maybe just on Sunday.  Have a great weekend everyone"

Tyler and I broke up as many of you may or may not know.  Frankly I hardly think it makes much of a difference, I'm still the same Rachel, nothings different except for the fact that I no longer have a boyfriend.  Big deal.  

All I've done lately is catch up with some friends I neglected while dating Tyler and made amends with them.   I've also gone to a few college classes those are working out pretty well.

But sometimes it's just so hard to pretend like you're okay when you aren't.  I'm not happy with myself or my friends.  I'm not happy with my love life.   I can't stand feeling like this, and I hate complaining.  I'm about ready to just tell everyone exactly how I feel, but that wouldn't be good.  Gosh, I'm sick of this update.  I'm going for a walk.

"event","Here's to a great first day of school...not.

I'll keep this simple and give you a rundown of my classes.
First off, we have <b>Spanish II</b> with Mrs. Pinon, let me tell you I'm not to thrilled about this one.  But with Kyle Blackburn, Tyler Dechant, Sam Nelson and Sarah Cruz it should be some fun.   
After that it was off to <b>Art I</b> with Mr. Simpson; Hallie H., Ryan L., Brynn H. and Ryker made that a semi fun class for the morning.   
Right after that I had <b>Algebra II</b> most of the class from last year was there so I can already tell this is gunna be a fun class, besides the fact that it's math.
After lunch I had <b>Aerobics</b> I have that class with Janee S. and Hillary V. so it should amount to some fun.
Right after that I had <b>World History</b> same kids from last year.  I hardly get along with that crowd anymore:(  Oh well, I like the teacher well enough.
Then it was <b>Chemistry</b> Jay's in that class with me and so is Kylie...I talked to Jay mostly only cause he's my favorite person right now.
Then <b>English II</b> eh I liked the teacher, kind of.  But the kids in that class bore me.  Blah, I love English tho.

So today in English I overheard an old friend of mine bashing his own brother for turning ""punk rock"".  I about reached over and slapped him.  Gosh people are so disrespectful.  He really needs to learn some r-e-s-p-e-c-t.  Or I'm gunna have to teach him some.  I mean he's the popular jock who everyone wants to be and here he is bashing things he doesn't know.  How fucking ignorant. I swear if he says something about it tomorrow I'm going to lose my cool.   

Eh, on a lighter note.  I did my english homework and hung out with Tyler and Jay.  Jay played PS2 for almost 3 hours haha he almost beat the entire Tony Hawk Underground game, he only had like 10 min left when Tyler's mom called.  Ha, oh well.

Well tomorrow I'm off to Hays after school.  It should be some fun.  I'll get to see Addie and Ashley I'm pretty excited about that.  

Well I'm done...good night"

I'm going to be pretty busy this first semester so I might get a little stressful.  Oh well I'm ready to make some progress.  

Sarah spent the night last night.  It was fun.  We ate most of a frozen pizza and drank some dr. pepper and stayed up late talking.  blah.  it was fun.  

I have to admit I'm still upset about the Kylie thing.  I don't know why I'm letting it get to me.  But I guess I'm just afraid to let go.  

I think I'm gunna go drive around with Tyler.  So bye for now.  Expect an update later."

"event","Wow I love starting trends...like the bold all that apply to you from a list of 100 items...yeah I wish people would have picked up my trend of putting it behind an LJ cut. It totally killed my friend page.  My friend's page is already murderous to load onto my computer because of my new transparent layout and now I have random lists of 100 things.  Blah I love complaining:).  

The infamous Ryan story.  Ok, for those of you who know Ryan you might understand this mroe than those who don't know him.  Well him and Tyler do not get along anymore.  Ryan's mother seems to think that it's my fault.  So she calls a meeting at Tyler's house and brings the cops.  Tyler told them I couldn't go, which I couldn't cause I was at the show.  Well Ryan's mom says some mean things about me, like that she knows my type and she knows my attitude and that she's never liked me from the moment she's met me (speaking of which I didn't meet the lady until Saturday, the day after she said all this) Well Ryan's mom and Tyler's mom decide to come to my house and read Ryan and I's msn conversations.  Growl.  They didn't succeed and I had to print them off for the both of them.  So to make a long story short I had a bad weekend and Ryan and I are no longer friends.  

I think trying to become friends with old friends is just overrated.  I'm trying to become friends with Kylie again and after all my efforts it's not working.  I had invited her to spend the night Saturday night, she told me her dad said she needed to wake up early the next day so she couldn't spend the night.  So I said well we should still hang out.  And she said sure and decided she wanted to take a nap.  She told me she'd call when she woke up.  Well she also said she was setting her alarm to go off in 30 min.  Well after 2 hours she still hadn't called so I called her.  And she told me that she'd ask her mom and call me back in 5 min.  15 minutes later she called and said she was really tired so she was staying home.  So I went to Tylers.  Well Jay tells me to call Kylie and I call her only to find out she's at Victorias.  I was crushed.

 I offically give up trying to be her friend.  I told her that the ball is in her court now and she can do with it as she pleases.  Eh, it's a harsh world, love.

Once school starts I promise I'll update regularly.  Plus I'll probably have more to update when I actually do stuff.

"event","Last night was pretty fun.  We all decided to go out to the haunted houses or more like abandoned houses because I don't believe in all that ghost stuff.  Well there were a ton of people out there so it wasn't scary at all.  We all walked through the first house and decided to head back into town.  On the way into town we all stopped at the railroad cars to see if we could get in.  We found a bunch of bones but we figured they were just animal bones.  Then we scared Susan because had found a hand or well a cow hoof but from our angle it looked like a human hand. So Brevan decides to pick it up and show Susan, in turn Susan screams and we all get a good laugh.  I have to admit for as scared as Susan was she is a pretty brave person. More than half of the group wouldn't even come near the railroad cars.  Well Tyler, Jay and I started to go back into town so I could get home and we took Devin with us cause he had to be home too.  Susan, Jon, Brevan, and Justin decided to go to the other haunted house.  Jon turned the car off and left the light on because he was scared, in turn running the battery down.  Well meanwhile we are on our way home.  Then we get a phone call from Jon and them saying the car wont start.  Now they are out by a haunted house in the middle of no where scared shitless so we turn around and go help them.  Needless to say I was home late. But it was a fun night."

Yesterday was boring.  I got to sleep in, so that was good.  I went and enrolled and came home and mowed.  Then Tyler came over and we watched The Perfect Score. 

Last night I went to the fair with my mom and my sister.  It was fun.  We watched the entertainment people for a while then I decided to see who was at the carnival.  I imediatly saw Brittany Hill and Bridget Clarke and a few of their friends.  Casey, Adam and Daniel were with them.  I talked to them for awhile then went and talked to Elias and a few other people.  I later caught up with my mom who decided to leave.   We went to Sonic adn got drinks and then I came home and did some volunteer work for KCSL."

"event","So I feel the need to update.  And for once I have the energy to.

Thursday consisted of me getting my hair cut.  After that I hung out with Sarah and we went to the show and watched OTC and Arcasia.  I enjoyed both bands pretty much.  I only watched the first set of OTC because well I'm only 15 and I have to be home by curfew, blah.  I picked up an Arcasia shirt and a cd.  Pretty good day I must say.

Friday was lame.  I cleaned all day and hung out with Tyler the rest of it. Nothing really exciting happened.

So far all I've done today was mow and get a ridiculous looking tan line from my tank top.  So I went and laid out in my back yard in my swimming suit to try and get rid of the ridiculous tan line.   God I'm going to die of skin cancer:'(."

"event","So I spent most of yesterday cleaning my room and geting everything organized.  Anyone who has ever been in my room knows how impossible it is for me to clean it.  I have junk everywhere.   Heh, I'm a pack rat.  So I was cleaning and somehow I sliced my hand with a big knife.  I won't go into detail because it makes me feel like a complete moron.  :) oh well.  

After I finished cleaning Sarah came over and we got some money to go to Target.  We opened up the door and Jeff was there.  So we made him follow us to target.  We all walked around Target for a while and then we went to Walmart.  After that I went home took a shower and again met up with sarah.  We went over to Tylers.  Tyler helped me fix my hand so it'd stop hurting.  THen sarah and I went and drove around.  We went to my house to get a hoodie and then we went to Sonic to meet up with everyone.  Then I just went and hung out with Tyler.  End of night.  Or well kind of.  I went to sleep early for a change and at about 2:30 Billy and Tyler call.  After I got off the phone with them....or well after my dad yelled at me....I couldn't get back to sleep til about 3:30...it sucked.  

So today I""m going to get my hair cut:).  I might post pictures later."

"event","People always tell me not to listen to what other people say.  But if I did what they told me I'd be listening to what other people say.  I'm so confused.  I've concluded that what people say has a very big impact on me.  Like a few days ago, Tiffany Lefort was giving me shit.  I'm not sure why but I'm sure Tiffany Baxter was involved with what most of Lefort was saying.  Lefort was giving me shit for the way I act, dress, and talk.  She says I dress too preppy and act too ""punk"" she also told me that I'm not that smart and to stop talking like I am because it's annoying.  This just pissed me off.  And I'm still pissed about it even though it was several days ago.  I'm in a terrible mood.

Anyways enough of that.  Yesterday I was awoken by the doorbell.  Sarah Trimble had decided to come over without calling, something that bugs me very much.  But I hung out with her for a while and decided to mow since I needed to.  I mowed, and changed my clothes.  Then Sarah and I went off to do some shopping.  Sarah bought some bracelets and I bought nothing cause I had insufficent funds.  Well we were walking back to her car and I shoved my hands in my back pockets and I found $11 dollars folded up in my pocket.  I swear I haven't been that happy in a while.  So Sarah and I decided to go get some lunch even though it was about 2.  After we ate we went to Tyler's to see the car they got.  Actually it was just a totalled Acura Integra they got to fix Tyler's car.  We left and went to Target and Walmart then back to our respectable homes.

I stayed at home for a while and took a shower.  Then I called Sarah and her and I went to Florence Wilson for a good 15 minutes.  We decided to go for a walk.  We walked all over our neighborhood and other peoples neighborhoods as well.  We went back to her house and she gave me a ride home.  

At about 9:30 I went and hung out with Jay and Tyler, after getting yelled at from my mom for about 30 minutes about how she's worried about me.  She thinks I'm going to be a dumb alcoholic/pothead/dropout by the time i'm going to be 16.  It's pathetic.  Oh well I guess she's just trying to be a good mom.  But Ty and Jay and I went and caught up with Soren and Kiel.  At about 10:30 we all came back to my house for a while.  Kiel, Soren and Jay went to go look at Enrique's car and Tyler and I sat on my front porch and talked.  The rest of them came back and they all let to go to Trent's and I got on the computer...end of the night. 

So today I woke up several times and just laid in bed because it's so comfortable.  Then the phone rang so I answered it and talked to Tyler for a while.  Then I got up and watched some TV.  I watched City Confidental, good show, then I watched Cribs for like 15 minutes.  Now I'm here eating a pb&j and writing a too long of post.  There I think i'm finished updating for a while."

The morning started out with me checking my email...and gaining back a very important friendship, I don't want to speak to soon in fear of fucking things up royally once again.  After that all took place I went to Breanna's little sister's play.  That was fun.  I saw Shelby and we said our good byes, since he went back to Ok. today.  

After I got home my mom dad and I went to run errands.  I got a pair of pants, popsicles and a pack of gum:D.

<i>Last Night</i>
Sasha and Shannon and I played phone tag for 15 minutes basically.  Finally they showed up and we all left for Mace's.  It's a miracle we ever found the place.  Well we got there and it was just a smokey basement full of gangsters but they were nice so we stayed and just talked to the people we knew.  Soon our friends started showing up and the night was looking brighter or maybe it was just the fact that they turned on another light.  Well Amadeus and Brittany showed up and I went and said Hi to both of them.  Brittany and I spent almost 45 minutes just sitting there talking because neither her nor I was smoking or drinking.  Well we sat there and talked and then all of a sudden she walked off.  I knew why but I won't specify.   Well Brittany comes back all mad and went straight to shannon.  There was quit a screaming match and Brittany left trying to avoid a fight.  I mean 18-13....Brittany is smarter than to go to jail for something that stupid.  Well to make a long story short Brittany and Shannon eventually made up.  Brittany gave me and shannon both rides home and on the way to my house.  Brittany and Amadeus and I had a great conversation and it makes me glad to have him as a friend again.  

<i>Today</i>
Today consisted of mowing.  Blah that was boring.  I got money for it though:).  I walked around my house took a shower, ate taco bell, and conversed on the phone with alot of people...oh that reminds me.  Tyler called:) and that makes me happy.  But yeah then Sasha came and her, her cousin and I went shopping...I didn't buy anythign :) which makes me happy.  I know lots of people who are addicted to drugs but I'm addicted to shopping.  Sasha and I then went to Jon's for like 5 milliseconds then left cause that gets old fast.  After that Sasha took her cousin home and we went to my house and then off to Sonic.  Then we went to Cody's and then to breanna's where Sasha's mom called and said she needed to be home.  So I stayed at Bre's and went w/ her Abbie and Josh to sonic.   I hung out w/ everyone at Sonic for a while then Kevin gave me a ride home...man I love that guy."

We test drove a few cars with NO intention of purchasing them being that they were way above our price range....A honda civic, A firebird, and a grand prix gt.  Actually I think we will be making a trip to Hays to look at the car i've had my eye on.  A 98 Mustang.  Well enough about that.  I miss Tyler and he hasn' even been gone for a full day.  I think I take advantage of the fact that I can see my boyfriend every day while many of my friends can't see their ""partner"" every day and usually not even every week.  Well Tyler will be back in 10 days:)

Nick R, Jon, David, Sarah, Jared, Tyler, Jordan and Soren all came over this after noon...and I wasn't suppoused to have anyone over...so i was stressing out and it's a relief to have them gone.

Tonight should be alright.  Jared is suppousidly having yet another party...so I'll probably stop by there after going to eat with Robert.  Since it's Tyler's las tnight here before his vacation I think I'll end up with him most of the time.

Sarah and I then preceded to go pick up some food at McDonalds.  We came back to my house and changed then headed over to Walmart to run errands for her mom. After that we went to Tyler's to see if he was home, which he was...him and Jay were just sitting in his garage so we talked to them.  

Sarah and I went shopping after that and talked to Clayton and Bobby.  I came home and cleaned for a while and Joshua and Cody came over which was boring so I left them on my front porch to go clean some more cause I needed too.  Then Sarah Josh Cody and I went shopping or well Sarah and I went shopping and Cody and Josh embarrased us and talked to old ladies.  

Tyler and Jay met us at the ""strip mall"" and we talked to them for a while, while Cody and Josh videotaped random things.  I decided I was hungry so we went to McDonald's yet again to eat, that was also embarrasing considering Josh and Cody were trying to get the McDonald's people to pose for a picture, I have to admit it's kind of funny in an immature obnoxious way.  

Later that night we went and met up with everyone at the River and we all headed into town and went to the lot.  That was boring.  I came home at 10:40 and Tyler and Jay stopped by.  

Sarah spent the night and all we did was get in a fight with Robert and stare at a strobe light for hour."

I then again get awoken by yet another phone call from my cousin Kiley.  She's such a dork.  I finally got out of bed.  After about 2 minutes of me searching the house for my family I sat down at the computer.  They then came home with lunch.  

Right after they got here with lunch Jay calls and says him and Tyler are coming over.  I took a really quick shower and went with Jay and Tyler to Bridget's house.  It was pretty fun.

"event","I've noticed that ranting has become an ever popular posting subject in recent months so I decided to give it a try and have my self a little bitch fest.  I haven't done this alot recently so wish me luck....starting...NOW!

Ok well there is this guy...Let's call him Kiel, well that's because that is his name.  Hopefully he doesn't read this but if he does then I guess he'll understand my point a tad bit better.

Well you see Kiel and I dated and we recently broke up...blah blah blah, story of my life.  He went to Missouri two days after we broke up.  During his week long stay in Missouri I was asked out by another guy that I had my eye on several months ago but never had the heart to ask out, well to make a short story long, I said yes.  The ""guy"" that I am dating now and I decided that we aren't going to go around annoucing that we are together, just to avoid the drama that my friends like to create.  But slowly people have started to notice that we are always together and started to pick it up from there. 

Well when Kiel came back to town he was informed of my new boyfriend, well this is where the confusion happens.  You see Kiel thinks I broke up with him because I didn't want a boyfriend...which is not what I told him nor what I told anyone else, I think he made that up in his head because the words ""I don't want a boyfriend"" were never said, I think it was something more like ""When we started dating I wasn't ready for a relationship this serious"" I don't know it was more than a week ago.  So now Kiel thinks that I am trying to hide my relationship from him...which is not what I am doing.  First off if I was trying to hide it I wouldn't have told him in the first place.  I mean seriously I was holding his hand at the zoo right in next to Kiel...if I was trying to hide it from him would I do that?  

Well this whole situation is ludacris and Kiel is still mad about it and doesn't understand my side which I have tried to explain to him and several other people.  

Another thing that bothers me is when I find out that people think I do not like them.  I'm a very nice person and usually like everyone until they give me a good enough reason not too...then I usually give them a couple more chances to get in my good graces.  Well several girls have gone around saying that I don't like them which is very untrue and actually makes me feel rather bad.  I think tonight I shall talk to them seeing as I have never really had a conversation with them.  

Also recently I've discovered that I'm not as happy with my friends as I thought I was.  I'm being pulled into this big mess of drama that I extremely dislike.  Also the sex, drugs and alcohol thing gets old and stresses me out.  I'd like to get as far away from that as possible, but it seems that is all teens are involved with these days.  

Ok this post is longer than intended...my apologizes.

<b>[Edit]</b>  I apologized to kiel and set him straight with the story so we are friends again Yay"

I went to Hays on the 3rd for my mom's birthday.  It was fun.  Ashley, Addie and I went and walked around the carnival.  I met a few of their friends which was neat.  Then on sunday we made our way home.  Ashley came back with us and is staying a good portion of the week.  

Ashley, Sarah, Tyler, Jay and I went to watch the fireworks on the 4th, which was gay cause it was raining.  We then came back to my house and did some of our fireworks which was fun.  Then Alex H. came over for a while and Sarah left and the rest of us watched The Shinning or well most of it.  

Then monday rolled around and we hung out with Tyler and Jay some more.  Monday night we went to Deus and Jared's apartment and hung out there for a while.  We won't go into details about that.  Haha.  

Tuesday was pretty much the exact same as Monday....hung out with Jay and Tyler and went to Deus and Jared's.

Tyler came over and we hung out for a while then he left to go to the Dentist and Sarah came over.  Sarah and I hung out and talked for a while and listened to a bunch of my old cds, which was fun.  Then when we had thought the rain had stopped we went outside to walk to her house.  Well we weren't even halfway down the street and it started to sprinkle so we just kept walking, well the furter we got the heavier the rain got, by the time we reached her house we were drenched.  We changed into some dry clothes and talked some more while our wet clothes dried.  

After an hour or so we got our orginal clothes to their orginal state and left for Breanna's.  We then went to Sonic and saw Alex, Alex, Nick and Elias.  Then Lane and Kevin pulled up so we all headed to the river and met up with everyone else.  We played with some black cats and bottle rockets it was fun.  

Then Alex and Jacob got in a fight which was fucking gay and caused way to much unneeded drama.  Now everyone is out to get Alex.  Most people are split trying to decide whose side to be on.  I'm staying out of all of that. 

Later Kiel and them lit the millionth sparkler bomb.  I swear these people have been spending tons of cash making them.  But I guess you only get one chance to do this a year.  

As we were about to leave Sarah got her car stuck in the sand and mud at the river.  So we called up Toby to come help us.  So here Alex, Alex, Sarah, Justin and Breanna and I were stranded at the river it was actually kind of fun.  Justin and I hung out and talked while we waited for everyone to get back and help us.  After we finally got it unstuck we all left.  I went with Tyler and Jay who both came back and hung out at my house for a while, it was fun.  

Then I got on msn and talked to Kiel, (we broke up) about a bunch of rumors I heard.  So we talked for a while and he said that everyones been talking about stupid stuff and he doesn't know what to believe so I tried to settle things and I think him and I are still friends.  I mean I've been losing alot of friends to lies lately, I'd hate to lose another. Grr.

Pardon the long entry.  I just wanted to be able to remember last night.

I've done a few nice pieces and a few other ones i'm not so proud of. My artwork is getting better though, I'll admit to that.   Anyways back to Tyler and Jay.  Well they came over fearing that Kiel was going to drive by since he's about a block away fixing his intake but I mean seriously if he's going to get mad that they were here then he can just get over it cause Tyler and Jay are really old friends of mine.  

Anyways today was a bore.  Sarah and I did some shopping and went to Justin's and woke up Amadeus.  Justin and Sarah were talking so I played w/ Deus's hair because I happen to love playing with people's hair.  Then Deus, Sarah, Justin and I went to lunch at Applebee's where I met a friend of my cousin Tanner's, that was interesting.  We went back to Justin's and hung out.  Deus and Jared said that they were officially my older brothers and I was there little sister and they said ""If any one hurts you, I don't care how they did it but they are going to end up in the hospital because you don't mess with our ""Little Sister"".""  I'm glad to know I've got people looking out for me.

I hate these moods, where I get extremly depressed for weeks at a time and have no reason why.  I shouldn't have gone out tonight it was terrible and I don't know why.  I had fun for a while then shit hit the fan and I couldn't control it.  I swear things are playing with my emotions. I've just been so stressed out lately.  My mom thinks I'm on drugs and my family is growing farther apart.  I wish there was something I could do but I can hardly control my own life and definitly not the lives of 3 other people.

Someone come keep me company

"event","Sorry for the lack of updates lately.  I haven't been in the mood.  Nor am I really in the mood as of right now, but I figured I had nothing better to do so here we go.

Lately I've been dating Kiel as some of you may know.  I knew I wasn't exactly ready for a boyfriend, but oh well at least I got a good one.  I'm not so sure how things are going to go when he goes out of town next week.  I'm afraid of it actually.  Oh well I mean I guess things happen that you can't always control.  

Last night was fun, I suppouse.  I hung out with Kiel and everyone at the lot.  Then a few of us came back to my house and hung out and listened to The Cure.  They left and I talked to Tyler for a while on the phone but cut that short cause his phone was dying.  Then Billy and I talked for a while and he was going to come over but I fell asleep downstairs and my phone was on vibrate so I missed his call.  

Enough of that.  I bought The Cure ""Galore"" cd yesterday at Hastings, I like it:) I got to hang out with Breanna for a while.  It was fun.  Well I'm rambling, so I'll shut up and let you go on and read other journals.  Buh Bye"

"event","ok, this started as a comment in rara8777 journal.  but it was going to be really long, and I wanted to share it with you guys.  

it started when I read there was going to be 4 more seasons of house.  I can see that ending horribly, there's only so many avenues with medical shows and they have used up almost of all of their collateral.   just like the x-files, it'll be a long, painful ending.  *sighs*   here are some of my thoughts...

  I sort of understood the logic behind getting rid of the ducklings, but they chose their replacements so poorly.  Taulb is just a bizarre choice, he has no chemistry with the team at all.  In fact, he throws off any potential chemistry betw kal penn and 13. It's one of the reasons the show was so good, the three of them had chemistry from the beginning.  I like those two, they could develop some chemistry (not nec. physical).  Penn is just hilarious and 13 plays off it well.  but they need to bring back cammy!  even my dad said so.  maybe they'll shoot taulb because he is just annoying.  bring back the old dude who wasn't really a doctor.  there also needs to be more clinic, since that seems to have been almost completely eliminated.  they provided much needed comic relief, and were sometimes the most interesting parts of the episode.  the old woman with syphilis...you are destined to feel good forever.  LOL.  
  why don't these producers realize when they are reaching their peak, and can go no further???  the only show I can think of that went out at the top of it's game was buffy (of the shows I watched).  certainly not x-files, alias, or ER.  IMHO, CSI and house should have their series finale this year.  what is CSI without grissom?  he's the focal point of the show, it was even brought up in season 2 how he's the supervisor and people are making a family around him.  they also tried that half season where catherine was a supervisor, with warrick and nicky under her.  that was kind of the beginning of the end for me.  it was like that didn't even happen after the season 5 finale.  .  and they replaced him with lawrence fishburn?  does anyone else find that weird?  I haven't seen him ANYWHERE in years.  I don't know why they didn't just make catherine the supervisor.  it's the logically choice...I don't know.  we'll see what happens...

I know, not personal.  one of these days I will write an entry about my trip to disney.  i'm still trying to catch up with everyone else's journals.  which is actually where this one started out...my brain is fried.  i go bed soon, I think.  

you guys rock if you read all the way down to here.  and I wouldn't blame you even a little if you didn't.  *does tired jig*"

"event","I said last monday was the day from hell.&nbsp; and also prefaced it with sort of.&nbsp; because it wasn't that bad.&nbsp; little things were just irritating the hell out of me.

word of warning.&nbsp; this writing is going to be choppy and horrible.&nbsp; I apologize in advance, usually I'm not this bad.

today was a day from hell.&nbsp; they called me at 9:30-9:45.&nbsp; I said I would be there 10:30 or 11:00.&nbsp; my mom wanted me to do stuff, and plus I haven't had a day off from there in over a week.&nbsp; I got there a little after 11.&nbsp; they had already done a few cases, and we probably had about 45 cases of shoes to go .&nbsp; 22 from redwing alone.&nbsp; so, ok.&nbsp; it was pretty steady, not crazy busy.&nbsp; but matt just got back from an industrial run, and then adrian said, we got the green light for trenton.&nbsp; and I almost said, ""oh no.&nbsp; we have at least 30 cases back there, and you, you lazy piece of shit, aren't going anywhere.""&nbsp; but I didn't.&nbsp; because I'm not a manager, and it wouldn't have made a difference.&nbsp; since, he probably would have just pouted and not done a goddamn thing anyway. 

alison left at like 1:30 or 2, which was fine because she's got that heart thing.&nbsp; it got busy.&nbsp; I was checking off shoes box by box, checking specials, and trying to help customers.&nbsp; this other chick (I call her box of rocks), janine, isn't doing much.&nbsp; I mean she tries, but she is really dumb as a box of rocks.&nbsp; she tries, but she is practically worthless.&nbsp; esp. when it's a) busy and/or b) we get hit with a big shipment of shoes.&nbsp; you know what she was doing when I was doing all this?&nbsp; calling fucking specials to let them know they were here.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but that can wait until we are done with all the shipments.&nbsp; just because you can't handle two things at once, I'm stuck basically by myself putting away&nbsp; a lot of shoes, helping customers, etc.&nbsp; NOT fun.&nbsp; I went up front to handle a question from alex (she said, if you guys are busy, I'll come back there.&nbsp; I said, no, I could use a break. she laughed).&nbsp; I thought I was going to kill janine today.&nbsp; so, I went up there and they figured it was her mistake.&nbsp; it usually is,&nbsp; but it wasn't.&nbsp; so, I called the guy and etc.&nbsp; I get off the phone, and say ""I don't know what to do with this.&nbsp; chuck it for all I care at this point.""&nbsp; we are talking about some other stuff, and I put my head in my hand and say, I guess I should go check on box of rocks.""&nbsp; alex is like, ""you are probably should.""&nbsp; I walk back, and the box I was working on, which all she had to do was put away.&nbsp; she didn't touch 1 fucking box.&nbsp; there was 1 person back there.&nbsp; it was just aggravating.&nbsp; beyond belief.&nbsp; 

janine called travis and tom to see if either or both of them could work.&nbsp; travis came around 4, and tom around 5.&nbsp; thank god travis showed up when he did.&nbsp; since around 12:30 that afternoon until 4 we had done around 8 boxes of redwing.&nbsp; that is not a good ratio.&nbsp; so, I had eric (another part-timer) grab some more and put them on the floor.&nbsp; to be sorted, etc.&nbsp; matt came back at like 4:20.&nbsp; and he actually worked.&nbsp; probably sensed that I was so not in the mood to fuck around.&nbsp; either way, we got all the shoes done by 5.&nbsp; I went and got food for me and a few other people.&nbsp; I seriously needed to get out of there.&nbsp; I got a cheesesteak, and a little eclair (sp rach?) for me.&nbsp; the eclair was perfectly chocolate, custardy goodness.&nbsp; I was in a much better mood after I got help, and even more so after I got food.&nbsp; after that, all was fine.&nbsp; 

I know I bitch sometimes, but that place is just beyond illogical and seriously inefficient beyond belief.&nbsp; I need a real job.&nbsp; like now.&nbsp; yay for vodka.&nbsp; thank russians for vodka.&nbsp; 

that is all.&nbsp; thanks for reading about my boring life.&nbsp; venting is good.&nbsp; venting is very good.&nbsp;"

Since at least one of my friends didn't see it, I made ample room.&nbsp; ok, did I miss something in a previous episode about warrick getting divorced?&nbsp; It definitely wasn't a shocker, actually it's surprising it didn't happen sooner.&nbsp; Feel bad for him, and he's right about the team being disconnected.&nbsp; For me, that's the thing that's missing the past two seasons.&nbsp; the team interaction has somehow gotten lost, and it's an after thought.&nbsp; NOT SPIFFY.&nbsp; that's what made it so great.&nbsp; yay for nicky stepping up and calling him on the pill poppin'.&nbsp; I wonder what his reaction is going to be to this thing.&nbsp; hell, I wonder what all their reactions are going to be.&nbsp; But they probably won't show that, much like they didn't show everybody's reaction to sara leaving.&nbsp; except for the blurbs by greg, and of all people hodges (but that really wasn't about sara, it was more about grissom).&nbsp; Have these writer's lost their ability to form connections between people?&nbsp; they must have different writers or something...I dunno.&nbsp; This epi was good, but I knew as soon as warrick came back to the club in the cab that something bad was going down.&nbsp; I did like the directing on this episode, it was very well done. they better show catherine's reactions, esp. with their history.&nbsp; we'll see what happens.&nbsp; and unlike other shows (e.g. House) it is actually on next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;  any thoughts you guys?

Loved this bit when the CIA dude and house are going up to the platform:&nbsp; ""CIA?&nbsp; come on, that's a bit much (paraphrasing)"".&nbsp; CIA guy on top with black ops helicopter:&nbsp; ""props help""&nbsp; LOL.
I loved it, esp. when wilson called CIA headquarters and house was there.&nbsp; the look on his face was awesome.&nbsp; Also liked the fact that house's cell has cutthroat bitch as the name for whoever.&nbsp; 

dude, I couldn't believe that freak poisoned the chick with whatever. that shit doesn't fly post -Tuskeegee.&nbsp; fucking whack job.&nbsp; 

I still heart cammy, esp. at the end with foreman.&nbsp; she doesn't belong in the ER, but I'm not going to complain because she's on the show.&nbsp; 

does anyone else think there's going to be a mutiny among the potential ducklings when they find out one of them has been upsurped by someone who didn't go through the process along with them?&nbsp; I know I would.&nbsp; so that leaves two spots, right?&nbsp; I like her though, she's a good actress.&nbsp; Was on er and I think homicide, as well.&nbsp; I predict mutiny though.&nbsp; it'll be interesting to see what happens next week.&nbsp;

woo for the black mormon guy decking house.&nbsp; I'm rooting for #13, past that I hope the cutthroat bitch doesn't get it.&nbsp; fucking with her about the guy she killed is just not kosher for human beings, but house of course loved it.&nbsp; the collar was over the top though.&nbsp; .&nbsp; but I doubt they would have two chicks get it.&nbsp; esp. if there's only two slots, now.&nbsp; I'm not too big on the surgeon either, he's way too hands off and precocious.&nbsp; ""I'm not digging.&nbsp; if something happens to these hands...""&nbsp; poor bosley, though.&nbsp; he was the man, but it made sense for him to go.&nbsp; he is too much like house, but without the degree.&nbsp; woo for the banter with the preppy surgeon guy, ""Oh, I guess they didn't teach that at your medical school.""&nbsp; shazam!

I HATED that the dog died.&nbsp; that was NOT cool.&nbsp; I thought it was over grief.&nbsp; but still cool that he hired the girl because he realized that she'd never do it again.&nbsp; poor guy, though.&nbsp; 

foreman fired, really didn't see that coming.&nbsp; wonder where that story line is going.&nbsp; 

ok,
that was probably really incoherent (much more so than my drunken one).&nbsp; but there it is.&nbsp; I go bed.

"event","I really liked this episode.&nbsp; it had a lot of team interaction and the cases were cool.&nbsp; My main problem with last season was there wasn't much team interaction, and everyone seemed to just kind of be there or something.&nbsp; My brain's fried, so I can't think of a better word.&nbsp; the ending was really puzzling.&nbsp; like sara seemed happy at the track, but also not.&nbsp; so I don't know what that was about.&nbsp; Grissom is like me, he doesn't do subtlety.&nbsp; If she didn't want to switch to swing-shift she shouldn't have suggested it.&nbsp; And maybe Catherine could have just done her evals.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; but she didn't seem all that happen at the end.&nbsp; but I loved all of them on the track together, despite that.&nbsp; woo for CSI epis of old.&nbsp; next weeks looks creepy...could be good.

"event","I got this in an e-mail, so some of you already got this, but I couldn't help but post this here.&nbsp; <br /><br />-lex :-)<br /><span id=""obmessage""><pre><br />&gt;&gt;The Washcloth..............<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;Ladies this has to be read, laughed at and passed on. There is<br />&gt;&gt;not a woman alive today who won't crack up over this!<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;I was due for an appointment with the gynecologist later in the<br />&gt;&gt;week.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;Early one morning, I received a call from the doctor's office to<br />&gt;&gt;tell me that I had been rescheduled for that morning at 9:30 am. I had only<br />&gt;&gt;just packed everyone off to work and school, and it was already around<br />&gt;&gt;8:45am. The trip to his office took about 35 minutes, so I didn't have any<br />&gt;&gt;time to spare.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;As most women do, I like to take a little extra effort over<br />&gt;&gt;hygiene when making such visits, but this time I wasn't going to be able to<br />&gt;&gt;make the full effort. So, I rushed upstairs, threw off my pajamas, wet the<br />&gt;&gt;washcloth that was sitting next to the sink, and gave myself a quick wash in<br />&gt;&gt;that area to make sure I was at least presentable. I threw the washcloth in<br />&gt;&gt;the clothes basket, donned some clothes, hopped in the car and raced to my<br />&gt;&gt;appointment.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;I was in the waiting room for only a few minutes when I was<br />&gt;&gt;called in.  Knowing the procedure, as I'm sure you do, I hopped up on the<br />&gt;&gt;table, looked over at the other side of the room and pretended that I was in<br />&gt;&gt;Paris or some other place a million miles away.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;I was a little surprised when the doctor said, ""My, we have made<br />&gt;&gt;an extra effort this morning, haven't we?"" I didn't respond.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;After the appointment, I heaved a sigh of relief and went home.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;The rest of the day was normal . Some shopping, cleaning, cooking.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;After school when my 6 year old daughter was playing, she called<br />&gt;&gt;out from the bathroom, ""Mommy, where's my washcloth?"" I told her to get<br />&gt;&gt;another one from the cupboard.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;She replied, ""No, I need the one that was here by the sink, it<br />&gt;&gt;had all my glitter and sparkles saved inside it.""<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;Never going back to that doctor ever.</pre></span>"

"event","ok, WTF.&nbsp; he fired #23 (aka the chick from the er, or Kathy Adams) within the first 2 minutes.&nbsp; all sorts of not spiffy...it sucks hairy monkey balls.&nbsp; I liked the old dude, though.&nbsp; he was cool.&nbsp; 

not spiffy was cam with blonde hair....so not liking that.&nbsp; loved that he asked the plastic surgeon if he saw a blond guy with peach fuzz.&nbsp; 

not enough wilson, but the arizona thing was a nice touch.&nbsp; 

YAY cammy's back (probably a limited time, but still, YAY).&nbsp; big time eye sex with house in the last scene.&nbsp; woo.&nbsp; even if she was smug, still major eye sex.

the religion quote was my favorite:&nbsp; "" most religious people don't listen to reasonable arguments.&nbsp; then there would be no religious people""&nbsp; best quote I've heard in awhile.

hehe.

overall, pretty good epi.&nbsp; I knew something was fishy when wilson said they were in AZ, but the calling cam was the icing.&nbsp; woo.

ok...I like the chick with the camisole thing who was washing the car (and pretended to quit, I have no idea what number she is), 6/9 (that was awesome.&nbsp; ""I approve of your shamelessness, but you are still fired."" until you mentioned getting wasted on tequila...woo!).&nbsp; eh on 13 she's so in your face.&nbsp; you can't have two in-your-face people...it's just not a good dynamic, and not sure of the other numbers.&nbsp; 39 might be there b/c of the boob job, but kinda iffy on him personally.&nbsp; so house will probably love him.&nbsp; and loved the old guy, as I mentioned.&nbsp; I liked #10 until he narced on the chick, he was SO fired after that.&nbsp; what do you guys think of the muslim dude?&nbsp; is he gone?&nbsp; too many numbers after a long day...couldn't quite keep them all straight *hangs head in shame*

love psych wilson.&nbsp;

"event","ok, I think I pulled a hamstring or something else in my thigh yesterday at work (doing something I've literally done hundreds of times).&nbsp; I put heat on it yesterday and again tonight, but it still tightens up after sitting for longer period of time (yay for recliners).&nbsp; anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; at least it's not like a constant pain, it's more of a dull ache after sitting.&nbsp; I'm going to stretch it again, and *makes mental note* not to overdue it at the gym, and THEN go to work without stretching said muscle ever again*&nbsp; 

on the other hand, the past couple of days I've gotten really nice compliments at work from customers.&nbsp; like telling my boss I should get a raise (three people have said that to my boss the last week or so).&nbsp; it makes everything worth it (maybe, even cheerleading moms...nah they are still the worst ever).&nbsp; so that's always all sorts of spiffy, even though he drives me crazy sometimes.&nbsp;

"event","My friend ladyjean had this posted a few days ago on her lj, and I thought it was fabulous.&nbsp; So, here is the letter to always maxi-pads.&nbsp; Enjoy!

-lex

 This is an actual letter sent to Proctor and Gamble from Wendi Aarons, 
Austin, TX, regarding their feminine products. She really gets rolling after 
the first paragraph...

Dear Mr. Thatcher,

I have been a loyal user of your Always Maxi Pads for over 20 years and I 
appreciate many of their features. Why, without the Leak GuardCore(tm) or 
Dri-Weave(tm) absorbency, I'd probably never go horseback riding or salsa 
dancing, and I'd certainly steer clear of running up and down the beach in 
tight, white shorts. But my favorite feature has to be your revolutionary 
Flexi-Wings. Kudos on being the only company smart enough to realize how 
crucial it is that maxi pads be aerodynamic. I can't
tell you how safe and secure I feel each month knowing there's a little F-16 
in my pants.

Have you ever had a period, Mr. Thatcher? Ever suffered from ""the curse""? 
I'm guessing you haven't.

Well, my ""time of the month"" is starting right now. As I type, I can already 
feel hormonal forces violently surging through my body. Just a few minutes 
from now, my body will adjust and I'll be transformed into what my husband 
likes to call ""an inbred hillbilly with knife skills.""

As Brand Manager in the Feminine-hygiene Division, you've no doubt seen 
quite a bit of research on what exactly happens during your customers' 
monthly visits from ""Aunt Flo"". Therefore, you must know about the bloating, 
puffiness, and cramping we endure, and about our intense mood swings, 
crying, and out-of-control behavior. You surely realize it's a tough time 
for most women.

The point is, sir, you of all people must realize that America is just 
crawling with homicidal maniacs in Capri pants... which brings me to the 
reason for my letter.

Last month, while in the throes of cramping so painful I wanted to reach 
inside my body and yank out my uterus, I opened an Always maxi-pad, and 
there, printed on the adhesive backing, were these words: ""Have a Happy 
Period.""

Are you f__king kidding me? Does any part of your tiny middle-manager brain 
really think happiness - actual smiling, laughing happiness is possible 
during a period? Did anything mentioned above sound the least bit 
pleasurable? Well, did it, James? FYI, unless you're some kind of sick S&amp;M 
freak girl, there will never be anything ""happy"" about a day in which you 
have to jack yourself up on Motrin and Kahlua and lock yourself in your 
house just so you don't march down to the local Kmart armed with a hunting 
rifle and a sketchy plan to end your life in a blaze of glory.

For the love of God, if you just have to slap a moronic message on a maxi 
pad, wouldn't it make more sense to say something that's actually pertinent, 
like ""Put Down the Hammer"" or ""Vehicular Manslaughter Is Wrong"", or are you 
just picking on us?

Sir, please inform your Accounting Department that, effective immediately, 
there will be an $8 drop in monthly profits, for I have
chosen to take my maxi-pad business elsewhere. And though I will certainly 
miss your Flex-Wings, I will not for one minute miss your brand of 
condescending bull s__t. And that's a promise I will keep.

Always.


Best,

Wendi Aarons
Austin, TX"

I haven't abused them or anything.  Next time fuck this plastic shit, I'm getting metal frames.  period.  *fist of fury at Nine West for making crappy, expensive glasses*  as if I needed to do another goddamn thing tomorrow.

"event","Ok, I loved this episode.  It was a combo of personal stuff (yay wilson at the end, sharing a pizza with a friend, then bowing and pointing to himself, movie whatever), and medicine.  I still really liked 1 day, 1 room (I know rach, you hated it).  I heart wilson, again.  He's being more like season 1 wilson.  I didn't think it was his file either, but I didn't think he was doing it just to get high either.  ""you kissed back"" was a great line (and the fact that he touched his lips afterward).  but even better was foreman's, ""you should be making out with cameron right now.""  I think it's so cool that he maybe went into the restaurant.  Wilson:  ""start small, take a chance with something other than sticking chemicals into your brain"" (I might be paraphrasing).  Just loved that epi!!  Soo good.  those bastards at fox, two more weeks before the next new house (or is it 3?).  goddamn you fox!

         Personality: Not many people understand you all that well. THey believe you to be, weird, strange, freaky, or just plain not normal. They think this because you don't always like to talk with people. They think you're one of the people that go around saying, ""Screw the world."" They judge you before they get to know you, almost every single time. What they don't see, is that you are an amazing person. You may be quiet and perhaps a bit shy, but you are very outspoken. Quite opionated as well. You just don't always share these thoughts because you are afraid of what people might think of you. Don't be afraid to let your true emotions show. You are a one of a kind person, and people could only see that if you only tore down that wall you put between yourself and society and show who you really are. Only then will people learn to love you. It may take some time to fo this, but once you finally have the will to do it, you will be thankful that you did. Although, you might've put up this wall to be away from harm, and pain. But the only thing you didn't keep out is any pain that you could end up causing yourself. For you are again, a truly amazing person, you just have to let people see this.        Color: Blue.       Stone: Diamond       Power: Healing       Element: Water       Animal: Bird       Quote: All these scars show, is that you're human.Quote by me.Message me if the personality is like you please!

Dosen't it happen that you're a noticeable unique person? If you answer is 'no', then take a good look at how people look at you and maybe you'll notice. You have something that makes you alluringly beautiful, but there's also a vibe that tells people to stay away. You like your privacy and expect others to respect it also, a thing that could sometimes make you look quite agressive. Unlike other people, you learned to deal with loneliness, by necessity or plain desire to do so.You have wounds though, that might not be seen by others, but that you feel at the most unsusual of times.P.S: If you're willing,please take a look at my other results and if you feel that the quizz and I deserve it,rate! <br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(128,0,128)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/Demostene/quizzes/What%27s+your+personality+like%3F+%28detailed+%2Bstylish+banners%29"">quiz</a>!<br/>

"event","Ok, I'm a little paranoid about this.  See, I've had casual friends (in RL and online) before that have just dropped off the face of the earth.  This could be for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with me.  BUT in case I am right, and I have said something to these people (or done something, e.g. contacted you too much) to offend them please, please let me know.  Either by e-mail, IM, or whatever.  This came up when a friend and I were talking about how a person just suddenly disappearing from online after chatting with her.  It bothered her, and she wanted to know why she might have been blocked.  So, that's where this is coming from.  In case you thought this was out of the blue.

The reason I want you to tell me if I've offended anybody in anyway is because it bothers me and I wonder why.  I obsess over it for awhile, because I really don't want to be that person (goddamn does that sound lame, and I'm sorry for the phrasing).  I hate being this self-conscious, but I am, so yeah.  

This is NOT guilt trip, I swear.  I don't do guilt trips.  My parents rarely did them on me, they just told me to do something if they wanted it done.  So, I don't know how to do them, nor do I hope this is coming off as self-pity bullshit stuff.  It isn't that either.  It's way more selfish than that.  It's me not wanting to be obsessing over things I may or may not have done, and how socially inept I am.  So, do me a favor, please just tell me if you want me to stop commenting, IMing, bugging in general, etc.  Because I will, not a problem.  I just ask you tell me why, so I don't do it to the next person and annoy them, too.  

I apologize in advance for whatever.  Please just let me know, and don't be subtle.  My parents were not subtle, so I do not get subtlety.  the blunter the better.  Thanks.

<lj-cut> freaking hodges...I think if I were grissom I would have smacked him, once for looking on eckley's desk and then another for sitting his ass down.
-aren't sabbaticals usually longer than a month?  like usually 6 or 12...
-that answered the question about her being a supervisor, guess they just forgot about that plot twist
-look on catherine's face when she asked him how long he had known was priceless
-what a bastard that adam novack is...yay for nicky being there
-well that answers the question about the inheritance...man, did they tie up a lot of loose ends in this epi
-there's something off about the sheriff
-that's creepy, it looks the same as the other house
-even creepier that it hasn't been touched in 3 years
-he shot the rabbit, how uncool
-love when nick gets that epiphany look on his face
-catherine's tempting fate here with that guffy guy, he would tell her anything for another button
-I knew there was something off with that sheriff, but everybody has their breaking point.  I would've lost it too
-man, grissom is worse than I am with people.  Nick, I'll be back in 4 weeks, stop hugging me.  that's cold man.  
-he does too have students...you grow with the mentor, but they will always be your students and you'll always been the mentor.  
-aww, warrick's the rock.  take care of her like you've been there for me, and you'll be fine. sounds an awful like a goodbye to me
-making it crystal clear about supervisors in this episode
-wonder what's sara is going to do/say
-I love how he is trying to take care of everyone before he leaves.  that was nice with greg, get your own counsel, they will throw you under a bus to cover their own ass.
-that poor family, having to go back to the house
-awww, how cute is that kid (and really sad at the same time) about how they are waiting for him to say goodbye, and his dad.  it's finally over for them
-I can't believe he ate a cookie...ah ha, GOTCHA with a bloody fingerprint
-it's time to say goodbye dad.  dad, goodbye baby, as he's gripping his kid...AWWWW...that was pretty damn heartwrenching
-I miss greg's spikey hair
-that was a nice moment betw the creep (novack) and catherine, everyone needs justice, if not the first time around, then the second.
-here's the moment I've been waiting for I'll see ya when you get back....come on, say something you bastard, don't make the same mistake AGAIN.  AHHHH...this is killing me!  aw, he said I'll miss you, and it looked like it pained him to no end.  goddamn is he like me
-the little half smile, but the look of dejectedness is more apparent on her face
-wtf is that???  oh no, not another goddamn cliffhanger.  

All in all, one of the best episodes of the season.  Full of surprises and very understated, but in a good way.  Not understated as in non-existent and lame, but just a nice subtle tenseness throughout the whole episode.  Very nicely done.  If only they hadn't done that goddamn cliffhanger...erg.  doing those every now and then is fine, doing them every episode gets a little tedious.  still creepy though.</lj-cut>

I miss my CSI buddy, now I know how you felt when I missed that one because of the world series.  not spiffy man, hope your electric comes back on soon.  *hugs*

"event","I wrote this ysterday at 3 AM in response on how to annoy retail/service workers.  So, if by some chance you've read it, you can skip (although I've added some pieces).  Here's one of my famous rants <lj-cut>3 AM rants...let it begin. 
general retail stores
-get off your cell phone before asking us for something. I can think of nothing ruder than talking on a cell phone and asking the person to wait on hold for a second, ask us for help, and then continue talking. Like we should be grateful they took time out of their busy lives, and allow themselves the graciousness to bow down to the little people in retail. Just get off the goddamn phone until you are done with the salesperson.  If it is that goddamn important take it outside or something because no one wants to hear it. can you tell that it irks the shit out of me?

-please, please, please bring your shit out of the dressing room. You don't have to fold it, make it look nice, or anything, just please bring it out. you can drop it in a pile if you want to.

-if you are getting jeans/pants for someone else, if possible rip the labels off new jeans, or get the style number in the tag (it just makes everyone's life easier, if not possible, just get someone who actually knows something)

-give us a break, we don't know everything.  just be patient

-I cannot tell you how good it makes me feel when a customer tells me how well I do my job and how helpful I was.  If you feel a salesman did a really good job, please tell them.  It'll make up for all those assholes the rest of the day.  

...just a couple for those of you who go to shoe stores with actual salespeople.

if your kid is getting fitted for shoes, you have to trust the person who is doing it. I'm so sick of parents saying:
    -are you sure they have enough room
    -let's try the next size just in case
    -let me feel where his toe is, just in case I don't approve (at this point, I'm usually like, ok, whatever, you can fit the kids shoe)
    -if your kid doesn't like the shoe, they won't wear it, no matter how much you like it (I did that a lot as a kid, yeah I'll wear it and never did)

-if you are going into a store to get a specific boot for someone, try and get the style number either off an old boot box, or off the shoe itself (or you could bring it in). This is a lifesaver for picky husbands/wives/bfs/gfs who have to get the exact boot or else they are not going to be happy. happy feet=happy people=happy giftgiver

if you are calling a store with a question know these things, if possible (pretty please?) in order of importance (if you know the brand, style, you're golden)
    -brand
    -style (should be on the tag, range from 3 digits to 6 digits in length)
    -size (including width)
    -color (if applicable)
    -height (mostly applicable for work boots)
when people call and say, ""I want to check to see about insert brand, but I only know the height"". This is not all that helpful, unless you get a person with a considerable amount of experience and who has basically memorized styles carried and previously carried. It's ok if you don't know those things, but the salesdude will be able to track down the shoe quicker with more info.

-if you want to see 6 different styles, break it up into sets of 2 or 3. Two reasons, carrying 6 shoe styles out is a bitch, and it's really hard to keep track of gathering all of those in the first place. Give your salesdude a break, unless they ask you for all 6.

end of rant...sorry about that.</lj-cut> just how inconsiderate and stupid people are annoys me sometimes, and it just manifests itself during the holidays as 10X worse."

"event","I'm completely hooked to CSI, even switched off the Mets game to watch it (didn't matter much, neither team did anything until after it was over, anyway.  it was fate, or something).  It was such a good episode, but a crazy, sad, heart breaking one as well.  The reason is because that kind of shit happens, where kids get bored and say, let's just beat up people because we are bored.  This is why I prefer animals over people.  Every animal I know of has a purpose for kicking the crap out of something (usually survival), and it doesn't just expend random energy because it doesn't have a 7-11 open at all hours.  It has to work for it's food.  ugh...I hate people.  I love greg though...he's my man.  So dorky, I love it.  Some nice GSR moments too (pick on someone your own size.  sara:  are you volunteering?  hehe).  

Mets won...*does jig*  I love Jose Reyes man, and his crazy hair.  He's my boy :-D, and yay tommy glavine showing them that you are not washed up.  If we win this series, it'll be in large part because of that man.

Deep Sea Blue - You are different and shine with originality, and some people may judge you wrongly for that. You tend not to follow trends, and it annoys you when people pretend to be who they aren't.  Just because other people are biased, doesn't mean you have to hide away in life.  Let your uniqueness be known, and bask in the fact that you're different from everyone else!  <br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(0,0,0)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/desertstarr/quizzes/What+Is+the+True+Color+Of+Your+Heart%3F+%5E%5E"">quiz</a>!<br/>

You are rather weak and submissive. You give in to everybody, and even if you don't on the first go, you give in after a bit of pleading. You are kind and sweet, and helps everyone. You may be upset on the inside, but don't show it to anyone. You like keeping your feelings to yourself-try sharing problems to others sometimes. People see you mostly as a great friend but quite shy. You mostly talk quite a bit to your good friends, those you have known for a long while, but you don't relate much to others. Show your fun side! :)<br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(0,0,0)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/elemmireq/quizzes/How+strong+are+you+really+inside+your+heart%3F"">quiz</a>!<br/>

I think it would be nice for them to win it all.

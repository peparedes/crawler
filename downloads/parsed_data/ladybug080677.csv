I'm ranting about work, BTW. I hate that cow! Stop making it seem like I am the most useless person on the face of the planet - I do a hell of a lot more in a day that you you lazy cow! And whether you like it or not, you are NOT MY BOSS. My boss is a rather cool, laid back guy, not a freaking beeatch!!! I need ice cream. I want to curl up in bed and hide. Ok, maybe I am a child!

I recommend the book I'm currently reading: ""P.S. I love You"" by Cecilia Ahern. It's excellent! 

Survived AHotF without Rach yesterday. It wasn't the same, I was bored. I made it through buildings in half the amount of time as my mom, so I did a lot of waiting by the door. 

Off to get oil changed after work... joy. Head hurts. Want election to be over so I can stop hearing about it. Turning off computer now and leaving this godforsaken hole! (that is actually a well paying, good place to work, I just wish ONE PARTICULAR PERSON would leave!!!)"

Have a work banquet thing on Saturday and it says ""cocktail or business suits"" for attire. I will be leaning towards the cocktail side, I think. Problem is, I own 2 cocktail dresses and I've lost 20 lbs since buying them. Hmmm. Delana, feel like taking something in this week? :P 

I'm 26 and today I bathed a cat for the 1st time. As in in the tub with him. I then blowdried him with my ion drier and he seemed to like it.

Spontaneously burst into shame flames. Then back at work they got us all cupcakes with Piglet and Pooh and they had Pooh balloons too. Yay! Went to dinner at Bourbon St. Cafe, was the BEST food I've ever had in my life. Highly recommend it, worth the parking rates in Bricktown. Went to see Weird Al, and he was everything I hoped he would be. Didn't play ""Twine Ball"" but I can accept that, as it's not one of his hits. But it IS my favorite. Listened to it in the car on the way home. Slightly disturbed to read that Al has a daughter- baby fro?"

Took a mini-break from the MWC LIB yesterday and called in sickie. Stayed up way too late Sat. night with Ace Gang and therefore spent most of yesterday napping. Had unfortunate moment when Sean and I went to eat about 5:30 (being the 1st time I ate yesterday) and blood sugar completely dropped. After scarfing food was suddenly afraid it would show back up again in a not-so-appetizing format. Then blood pressure started going all crazy and I thought I was going to pass out. Threw some cash at Sean for him to pay bill and went and laid in car. Felt better later last night so went on cleaning spree in preparation for friend Candy coming over to scout out apartment as possible new home. Didn't want her to get bad impression of my housekeeping skills, and wanted place to look its best when she considered moving into the complex. In middle of night it dawned on me, can't have someone coming to scout out apts when large mildew stain on ceiling!!! So emailed her and got raincheck pending maintenence ever showing up. 

Spent entirely too much money this weekend but had a hella good time doing so. Went to paint it yourself pottery with Rach and Jess and painted a chiminea. Rach made cute, if profane, mug. :) Had to get car charger for celly so that was another expense. Then food, etc. Spent small fortune on clothes but when the receipt says ""You saved $306.94"" then I feel it can't be bad. In fact, wearing new shirt right now! The fact that it was $5 makes it even cooler.

We were also given paper and shown how to make a FAN! Woo hoo! (not!) The highlight of the evening was when the lady next to me started choking on a grape. I just looked on. 

On a side note, library regular ""Flossie"" fits several of the criteria for an elderly person suffering from heat stroke. I said as much to the librarian sitting next to me, wondering if that was the explaination for her massively annoying self, and she completely missed my sarcasm and became concerned about Flossie since her car doesn't have air conditioning. I say, first, never misunderstand sarcasm because you automatically go down 3 cool points on my cool-o-meter, and second, if Flossie's hoopedy doesn't have AC it's a sign from god saying STAY THE FUCK HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

On an unrelated note, working with 7 women is very tiring. Keep replaying conversation in my head that I had today, in which I was venting about a coworker taking a CD home that I needed, and another coworker informing me that no one was really thrilled with me when I was out sick. This bothers me. Why are we not allowed to get sick? Is it not enough that we are A) sick, without B) having to come back to work to a bunch of pissed off people. Granted, we were slammed, but I had no way of knowing that. I didn't think I was leaving much to be dealt with. Other bothering factor is that I have a sinking suspicion that coworker who told me no one was thrilled will rat me out to other coworker. Why is this? Why the lack of trust? I consider her a friend, why is it I don't trust her completely? Not too bothered about CD snatching coworker being upset as I can deal with her moods better than anyone else's around there. Que sera sera. I hate bitching about work but as I have so little else to bitch about and have to bitch about SOMETHING, work it is."

I bought the cats a giant sleep pillow last night. We named it Munchichi. The idea was the keep the fur <b>on</b> the pillow and <b>off</b> the bed. Not surprisingly they hate it. Pepper smushed herself between it and the headboard, careful not to actually get <b>on</b> it, and Penelope is afraid of it and steers clear of Munchichi's general vicinity. I think I may have to rub catnip all over it. You know, you buy them perfectly good toys, and they want to sleep on my shoe.

"event","Bad Ju-Ju @ work today. Not, repeat NOT, looking forward to tomorrow. Can remember a time, back in my youthful exuberance, that I looked forward to going to work each day. Also recall time when woke up in morning feeling excited to go to work. Now wake up and immediately count hours till can come home and go straight back to bed. Just ate the equivalent of about 3 cookies in just dough. Can feel ass expanding like inflatable balloon only it never goes down."

"event","Every time Sean and I go to Taco Bell, we get this very odd guy working the counter. The first time we went in, he asked us if we wanted to eat our food there, or if we ""wanted to take it on the road like Willie Nelson."" We went there again last night and got the same guy. He's one of those guys who, when taking an order, turns to the person with you and says, ""How bout yourself?"" Anyway, we told him Sean and I were doing separate orders, to which he replied, ""Oh, going Dutch and speaking German, huh?"" which baffled us completely. The ordering nightmare over, we proceeded to wait forever for our food. At some point during the wait I got up to go wash my hands. When I returned, Sean was being verbally intruded upon by said Freak. All I got out of the snippet I heard was something about a thing that could jump and would scare the shit out of you. I was later told by Sean that first he was discussing how nothing was scarier than two chicks on their periods QUOTE going at each other's throats like billy goats END QUOTE. He went on to talk about he was in the 1st Desert Storm and there were these huge ""camel spiders"" that would attack anything and that they pop up out of little trap doors. Evidently this was where I came in. I heard the part about them being able to eat birds. We ate quickly and subsequently decided not to go into that particular Taco Bell ever again, or if we did, we would take it on the road like Willie Nelson."

"event","Hrm... the fact that my LJ name is spelled wrong (Don't think I never noticed, I've always known, I've just never fixed it) has been annoying me lately.  So I think I'll just make a new name.

But anyway.  Today was another boring day.  But I did find out something abnormal occurring in the mind of my parents.  If anyone has watched the news recently, Thailand had been hit by a tsunami, resulting in some 140,000 deaths.  Anyway, my mom was talking to me and she said, ""Phillip, what would you say to us adopting someone.""  And so I am thinking, haha, funny, jokes, yeah.  Then she says, ""(Storm, blah blah, thailand, misfit children, blah) your dad may want to adopt a child who lost his/her parents.""

...?

So yeah, a bit random, but I'm not 100% sure if they are serious, but it did sound like it.  The possibility would be somewhat interesting.  It would be quite an experience, for better or for worse.  Well, who knows what will happen?

Eh, so I think this will be the last entry before I make a new LJ name.  Peace."

I don't know if anyone had thought of this, but it came to my mind while I was at the mall.  

So everyone knows all about the Lance Armstrong bracelets and its for a good cause, blah blah blah.  Don't get me wrong, I won't wear one unless someone gives it to me, but it is a good cause.  But anyway, I noticed  that a person in front of me at Todd's was wearing a Livestrong bracelet.  So being that it is a common thing now, I just basically kept thinking about whatever I had been thinking of.  Then I hear ""I'll have a small diet coke, please.""  For some reason or another, I just thought... ""Wait a second.  Doesn't Diet Coke use a artifical sugar that generates cancer?""  This may sound like I'm trying really hard to bring down people do this, but I'm just thinking.  Doesn't drinking diet coke and wearing a Liverstrong bracelet make them contradictory to each other?

I don't know where this came from, so don't hate me for it.  I think I was just looking for any excuse to find something to think about at the time other than all the antics of people in the mall."

"event","There are so many things I life that I take for granted, but I'm starting to realize what these things are.  First and foremost, my brother.  It seems like any time I've been down he's always been there to help me back up.  He gives without asking and never complains to me when I do something wrong, but he tries to help me.  

I believe there are so many things that not many people do not take the time to appreciate anymore.  One of these things , which is so plainly obvious, is probably most helpful.  Music.  I can't think of any point in my life when music hasn't been there.  I remember since the 6th grade that music has always been my escape.  It doesn't matter what type of music you enjoy, but its just the fact that these melodies, all the simple and complex melodies, that could have been contrived in a matter of minutes, can be so influencial to the way you act and/or think.  So many times music has changed my moods just by the amazing sounds produced on instruments mass produced to fit the needs of every person wanting to fill their void.  Like Jake said, its the language of the soul, spoken through a microphone, guitar, bass, drums, or any other instrument.  It speaks to everyone in a different way, but everyone can find a common ground through it.

Its so hard to explain how I feel on things.  Not because I have bad literary skills, just because my way of thinking and speaking on certain things doesn't come out exactly how I see it.  

God... so random.

"event","And so it comes to the one thing that I have always feared happening to
the durggies:
Coke has invaded our school.<br>
<br>
I'm going to leave it at that for certain safety reasons. If you are
wondering if I am one of the victims, you don't know me too well. And
if you don't know if that was a yes or no... it was a no.<br>
<br>
I don't feel the need to summarize the past few weeks because, 1) I
don't think anyone really reads these entries. 2) My life is still
boring.
But I've actually decided, aside from all my previous vows, to study
more whole-heartedly than I usually do for exams. I spent two hours at
Starbucks today just studying for one subject. I really need to prove
to myself that I can go above and beyond what I think I can do. I <b>need </b>to do the best I can.&nbsp; So, go me.<br>
<br>
I really don't have anything interesting to say, other than my personal
feelings on a few things.&nbsp; The only thing that has given me a bit
of pride has been the fact that I, along with two or three of my
friends, have been standing up for the 8th graders that play hackey
sack.&nbsp; A group of 9th or 10th graders have been making fun of them
a lot, so we decided, as ""big"" upperclassmen, to help the
underdog.&nbsp; It was amusing, really. One of our friends starting
bitching them out very unpleasantly and Dallas decided to start making
fun of them after they were verbally owned by our other friend.&nbsp;
He was just saying stupid things like, ""Wow, you just got schooled, in
school"" and ""You can say anything you want about me, I already know I'm
ugly."" I just found the whole back to 6th grade jokes hilarious, since
we usually say shit like that when we're joking around.&nbsp; So we did
our good deeds and it feels pretty good.<br>
<br>
But anyway... still where I was last time but with my feet on the ground.&nbsp; Peace.<br>"

Also, the mall has become a seizure of colors and people.  It was rediculous to see all these kids just ""hanging out"".  Seriously... this has got to stop.  As one of my friends from HC that I saw pointed out, during a conversation while waiting for his girlfriend by the bathroom.

""Now that just ruins my faith in this mall.""
""What are you talking about?""
""A girl just walked by wearing bondage pants, all gothed out, with a Story of the Year T-Shirt.""
""Hrm...""

Whats worse, is there a kids, a little more than half my age, walking around like gangstas.  For instance, there was a little kid walking around with his brother (I'm assuming), and both were decked out with a headband, Basketball jersey (-undershirt), and those really, redicously long shorts that look like two paperbags sewn together.  But the climbmax of their appearance was the fact that both of them, were grabbing their balls THE WHOLE TIME.  I mean... really, the kid with him was about 9-10.  We wonder why everyone is so screwed up?

But aside from the crazy antics of teens in the mall, I'm pissed at a certain someone at BM.  I'll just lay it out for you.

I have been planning on forming a club called Musicians United, to help out people who play an instrument and don't want to be in jazz band.  Everyone thinks its a great idea, EVEN the principle, who told me that it was ""A very innovative"" idea twice.  So I go to talk to the activites director and she tries her best just to shoot me down the whole time.  It basically went back and forth like this

LeBlanc: You see, forming this club would conflict with the Jazz Band, because thats what they are offering.
Me: Actually... Jazz Band does not really does not offer the chance to learn how to read music.  So most of the students who want to join, can't.  So this is the alternative.
Leblanc:  Well... blah

But whatever, I'll just keep annoying them.So far, this has undoubtedly been my best start in school.  I've gotten nothing less than an A on my tests and I only missed one assignment (but in Religion so it doesn't count).

Anyone want to go see Collateral with me?  Possibly in a good seat?"

<P>I think I'm going to start going to work out Tuesday and Thursday so I can get skinny and be buff (but not muscle head buff, just regular buff?).&nbsp; If anyone wants to go, holla.&nbsp; I can only&nbsp;bring one guy and a girl because I can sign them in as my brother and sister&nbsp; I'd have to pay ten dollars for each person if they were signed in as guests.</P>
<P>Trey and I have been thinking that we need to join more clubs to put on our transcripts so we're joining: Newspaper, Welcoming Diversity(?), and I'm creating a club called Musicians United!</P>
<P>Ownage.</P>"

"event","Today was a mediocre day.  Finally bought my warranty for the camera and that was about it.  The whole morning and part of the after was spent working, trying to think of a plot for a movie, reading, and being an internet bum. 

Just got back from the Village.  It was really good for those of you who haven't seen it.  Very good plot.

But I realized something right after dropping Trey off. I drove to the stop sign and remembered something Trey had said a few weeks ago.  I sat for a minute and just thought.  I think I realized that I need to just let go of certain things and just stop trying to get somewhere I'm not going to be.  I've been procrastinating with these ideas and I really believe that nothing, has come out of them.  This whole time... and I've been misleading myself.  I'm such an idiot for not seeing things the way they have been the whole damn time.

I'm sure to some people this will be plainly obvious, and to others, oblivious.  Goodnight."

"event","Today was a lot of fun.  Aside from the depressing (but amusing) scenes at the Alzheimer place for service hours.

After six or so hours of service, Trey and I picked up Ian and went to Schubert's.  We got the boat running and took it out for a ride in the lake for about a half hour since we only had a quarter tank of gas.  Then we picked up Joey and went back to my house, where Trey and I worked on our non-metal song? Crazy.  Its actually really good.  After awhile of jamming and taking pictures my brother called to see if we wanted to go sailing.  So Trey, Joey, and I (Ian went home because Tanya is a bitch) went to Pier One and met up with Jordan and Jill and went sailing.  We basically just talked about random things and everyone drinking, except moi (The DD).

Trey was seeing pink elephants.  

He came back to my house after we dropped Joey off.  He started talking about us being friends and his compulsions.  

Now I'm here, still not knowing how to post pictures.  Help would be appreciated."

People like to be around you because you are a calming influence.  You have an appreciation for all things beautiful, and you probably have some potted plants.  You also most likely own a cat.<p>

It hits me, this city is not meant for people under twenty-one.  Even my twenty year old brother thinks this place sucks.  You are limited to so little when you are even one year away from twenty.  

Then once I realized what happens when you turn twenty-one, I get even more pissed.  What is there to do besides drinking in this state? Unless you are filthy rich like most of the fucking bastard ass customers at work, you have nothing to do.  Maybe I'm over reacting, but I really hate Louisiana.

Also, most of the people I know have been content enough to not even ask me to do anything.  But thats what friends are for, right?

Well, I'll just keep going out of my way to try and find SOMETHING to do in this shitty town.  Maybe a fight would be nice?  Oh well... I'll just shut up because I'm just being obnoxious and angry for no reason.

"event","<P>Well... two friends down, three left.&nbsp; Unfortunately after the escapades of my friends in Mississippi, all of our parents have been informed that one of our friends is a druggy and an alcoholic.&nbsp; Well thats at least what Tanya thinks, fuck her.&nbsp; I don't like the fact that she doesn't bother to listen to us, or even bother to ask us about it before she makes assumptions.</P>
<P>So while Ian and Max are immobilized by the parental restraints, Trey, Joey and I are on our own.&nbsp; Trey and I realized how big of losers we are once we realized it was only three of us.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp;&nbsp; It happens.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It could be good for us though, we'll be able to start hanging out with new people.&nbsp; Enough of this, its in the past.</P>
<P>Went and saw Spiderman 2 for the second time last night.&nbsp; Don't see it twice.&nbsp; It definitely wasn't as good the second time.&nbsp; I had to force myself to keep awake in the middle of the movie.&nbsp; But the real moment of the night was when I was walking out of the arcade to see who Joey and Trey were talking to.&nbsp; They were talking to some girl and when I walked up it went like this:</P>
<P>""Geez, how old are you?&nbsp; You look like you are forty""</P>
<P>""Uh..... not really""</P>
<P>""Yes you are, you look like you could be their dad""</P>
<P>""Uh..... no, I'm not that old""</P>
<P>""Your lying""</P>
<P>""Want to see my License, I'm not forty""</P>
<P>""Yes"" (Looks at license)""Oh...""</P>
<P>""We got to go to the movies, bye kids""</P>
<P>And that was the night.&nbsp; Now I'm cleaning my room for mon mere.&nbsp; Peace</P>"

"event","Decided not to finish updating the other day... whatever.

Although I was excited to get back home, I've found that I hate this place.  The place I've grown up.  I really need to move out as soon as possible.  This place seems to only bring up all the bad things that I've wanted to forget.  I'd really like to just get up, walk outside, steal my dad's truck, and just drive...  Not run away so to speak, but just leave and start over.

Everyone seems to be happy now.  All the dedication I've put into certain things have collapsed and I can't forget it.  Smoking, and thinking that it will make everything better, but just ending up making it worse by remembering everything and how I won't be able to do anything about it. 

All the shit I've dealt with, all the bent up anger that I've stored inside, all the tears that I've blinked back, everything I've done to try and make myself a better person seems not to get me anywhere.  Obviously I wasn't meant to get the things in life that you can't buy.

And despite everything... I can't forget.  I would give up anything just to forget the things that I have wanted.  But of course I can't.  So I'll just have to keep going, knowing that I'm just going to be constantly hurt."

"event","Lets see.  Went on the college run and I have to say that I was very surprised to find that it was very fun.  I was somewhat scared that it was going to suck, but I was wrong.

The first day was pretty fun.  On most of the days I don't remember which college we visited or if we did at all.  Auburn I think.  I really liked that school.  Most everyone didn't like it for some reason or another.  But I still really liked campus and such.  Probably #3 on my top 3.

Second day we were late... my bad.  Rando was pretty mad, but I took the blame so he hated me.  It was all good though.  Went to Georgia Tech and that was a very nice school.  It had all the trinkets you could want.  The campus was very nice and it was a nice thing that the college was basically connected to the city by way of a small bridge.  #2.

From here until the 7th day was pretty boring with colleges, but mixed in with random funny things, and just being stupid.  It was our free day, and we had a shitload of fun.  Went to Aero Space museum first and looked at all the planes and such.  Met up with Annie, lost Annie when we ate, then found her and she left for the Arts Museum (later met up again at Natural History).  Went to Natural History, where we repeatedly tried to get rid of people who were following us.  The mammal section was all I saw, but I heard the other sections were just ""okay"".  Then we went and sat for a little while on the mall where I completely annihilated Ian in a tackle, played some hackey sack, and made a fire.  Then we found some guy with big signs on the street, talking about his group trying to get people to stop circumcising their children.  He was telling us about how much better it was with the... while... you know.  Anyway he was going to take a picture of us by the sign when he said, ""SAY PENIS!"" and I completely started cracking up because I was on the phone with my dad.  Took pictures of Ian, Joey, Max, Joe, and Tom walking around with signs that said random things from a er... can't think of the word (where you walk around outside the memorial or whatever with signs, chanting various crap).  Went home.

Then we went to University of Virigina.  Woooohoo.  It was great.  The campus was beautiful, the academics sounded great, and the social sounded cool.  Our tour guide was really cool and was telling us about a streaking tradition they had.  Ian offered to do it then and there.  I'm also going to be on TV... along with the rest of our group, because they were filming us for this Politics reality show.  Nothing amazing, but it'd be cool to see myself on TV.  But after that it was still getting better with all the things they have around campus, secret societies, and just general campus life.  Thats definitely my favorite.  #1!!!!!!!!!

I'm tired... I'll finish updating later."

"event","<P>First off.&nbsp; What is with the whole sausage thing? I really can't seem to understand that for the life of me.</P>
<P>Anyway.&nbsp; Today was full of stressful&nbsp;shopping.&nbsp; Most because my mom likes to get the best of everything when any of us go away.&nbsp; Its all in good intent, but I really don't need to spend a lot of money on things I don't need.&nbsp; I'm a simple person, I don't need much besides a computer, food, and friends.&nbsp; A girlfriend would be nice too (I probably seem like a whiny bitch saying this every entry, haha).&nbsp; </P>
<P>All of the sudden, people from HC are calling wanting to hang out with me.&nbsp; Unfortunately none of them call at good times.&nbsp; Bah.&nbsp; I want to hang out with them but I'm always occupied, my bad.&nbsp; I shall make time after the college run.</P>
<P>After the shopping excursion, I went to Borders (the place I needed to go to use the gift card) to go find a book.&nbsp; Little did I know how much that place sucks.&nbsp; I really didn't like the way everything is organized there, but as long as I find what I'm looking for, I'm good.&nbsp; Looked around for awhile and came across a book I had been wanting to read.&nbsp; So I bought it.&nbsp; <EM>Catch 22</EM>, not only an amazing band, but also said to be a great book.&nbsp; I know what a lot of people are thinking after I said that, ""He just bought it because of the band"", and I didn't (for the most part).&nbsp; A friend of mine had actually read it and said it was very good, so I decided to get it.&nbsp; Just because I like the band doesn't mean I only bought it for that reason, even though the book has NOTHING to do with the band.&nbsp; And I've found myself rambling to a lifeless monitor.&nbsp; Need to stop.</P>
<P>So I'll just keep going.&nbsp; Apparently, we're going to be on a bus for 7 hours... yay.&nbsp; Plenty of time to eat my 3 BAGS OF <U>BEEF JERKY</U> &amp; drink my&nbsp;GALLON&nbsp;<U>GREEN TEA</U>! Woot.&nbsp; And also a good chance for me to catch up on my reading and listening to music.</P>
<P>I found a new band, if anyone is interested.&nbsp; Belvedere.&nbsp; From Canada, punk, but in my opinion they are really good.&nbsp; Its not all the same chord the whole time. If you are a pirate, download Repetition Rejection.</P>
<P>I think my new cheesy ass ""poser"" shirt fits me very well.&nbsp; ""Bored, Lazy, Hungry... seeking band or <STRONG>girlfriend</STRONG>"".&nbsp; It should be &amp; girlfriend.&nbsp;</P>
<P>When I get back, I'm going on a crusade.&nbsp; Fuck the holy land, I'm&nbsp;finding a girlfriend.</P>"

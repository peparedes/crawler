"event","Long time no update. I have three jobs again so I have no time to do this shit. WR, an after school program, and babysitting like crazy. But I can afford to do stuff soon. I actually have money in my savings AND checkin accounts now.

But I owed $400 for car insurance by the 15th and I don't get paid by either job til the 21st, so there was no way I'd have it. I planned on getting rid of the car until Joey told me he would pay the $400. He actually wrote me a check, and told me I didn't need to pay him back. He said ""When I told you I love you Meg I meant it, even now that we're just friends I still do.. and I'm gonna be here to help you out and look out for you."" I told him I'd pay him back anyway and he said don't rush, it could take 10 years for all he cares.
That was the nice Joey.

Then he decided to go back to being an ass. He's taken a liking to calling me fat, and I know he's joking.. i'm 5'1"" and 105lbs.. that's exactly what I should be, but he knows I've always been paranoid that I'm overweight. So after a while, even joking around, it gets pretty annoying. I try to exercise as much as I can, but having 3 jobs kinda exhausts me to the point where it's kinda hard. But whatever. 

So last night we went up in the mountains to try to find the Jackson Whites even though they're nuts and they'll literally kill you if you go up there at night.. Cops refuse to go up there, unless they absolutely have to for an emergency, and the jackson's have their own firetruck in their little village because they don't want anyone up there. Naturally its' a popular place to go fuck around. We went up there last night, Me, Jeff, Joey, Emily, and Nicole.. found the little village, but it was gated off and fenced off where you'd have to walk through their. We all said fuck that we don't have any knives guns baseball bats or flashlights, and it's 2:00 in the morning. So we just drove around and got lost in the mountain extremely close to their little village. it got kinda creepy.

This Emily girl is Johnny's ex girlfriend, and she's alright, but I've had a bad feeling about her ever since the day I met her. Now (since the ambulance corps and fire dept take 'sharing' a little too far) she's with Joey (He really likes her but she claims they're just friends, though it's gone farther than that) and obviously that's a little awkward for me. Me and Joey were doin good, we were gettin close again, hanging out, we'd hook up obviously and i'd sleep over but we weren't back together. We've discussed getting back together in the future, and he was great to me. She comes in the picture and he treats me like shit now. Unless of course he's not gonna see her or talk to her much that day. Like last weekend. So whatever.. he thinks now that I'm jealous of him and her, and I told him to get over himself. I'm not jealous, because I know we're not dating, I just don't like the girl. I'll hang out with her and be nice, but there's something about her I don't like, and even when she was with Johnny (and god KNOWS I feel nothing towards Johnny) I didn't like her.

and Yes, it hurts to see the two of them, because it's like watching me and joey the way we were when we started going out. He treats her the same, wonderfully, he talks to her the same, they have fun.. and god I'd give anything to have that back. Obviously I want him to be happy, because I'm absolutely in love with him and I'll always love him.. but it hurts. It hurts when he's on the phone with her for hours, and when we're all hanging out, because it's just me and him, except not me this time. And honestly, I feel like I'm losing him now, even as just a friend. I don't want to lose him again.

and remember the month of august? I was about 90 pounds because I couldn't hold food down, and I didn't sleep more than 2 hours every night for a month. It was the worst month of my life, emotionally and physically, and it was a nightmare, and I'd do anything to not have to go through that, ever again. Well the past 6 nights I've been dreaming it, and just reliving it in my sleep. I get the same feelings and wake up with the same feelings.. of being empty, ugly, hopeless, useless, a lost cause, just feelings that I can't describe. It's better that it's just a dream, except it's NOT.. it was a reality not too long ago.. and it's so real. It literally is just me reliving it over and over and over, and it's driving me nuts and it's getting bad. I don't know how the hell to stop dreaming about it though, and I don't know what triggered it. 

Maybe it's because I lost him then, and I feel like I am again. I mean I'm not surprised.. just looking at this girl.. she's prettier than I am, smarter, better shape, more fun I'm sure, she drinks more, she's got WAY more money, what the hell does he need me for? Whatever. I'm trying so hard to have fun at this point before graduation and college starts.. It's beginning to get very difficult to do that though."

Because I got my kiss goodnight last night =)

And then I got home and Joey called. He'd been kinda blowing me off all week, when <b><font color=""#808080"">all</font></b> I wanted to do was congratulate him because he got the job as a policeman that he's been working his <i><font color=""#808080"">ass</font></i> off for. So I was like whatever fuck you.. He was more interested in the rumors that me and Scott are goin out than he was in actually <font color=""#808080"">talking</font> to me. But last night he must have wanted ass or something, he called to see if I could sleep over. But umm I said no. lol. I do still need to have a talk with him and just tell him the sleeping over's gotta stop, we gotta be just friends. Maybe in the future like we <font color=""#808080""><b>already</b></font> discussed if things work out the right way, we can be together again.. But right now I just don't want the drama. 

and as far as me and Scott? I don't really know what's going on with us. I <u><font color=""#808080"">really</font></u> like him, and I got my kiss, but we'll see where this goes.
I don't have work today and it's a Saturday. Weird. I got bored yesterday so I opened up a checking account. <font color=""#808080"">Who does that??</font>

I'm gonna go visit Jeff at work I think. Tonight is drunk Twister at Mike's house. How fun is that gonna be?? Probably more fun than drunken Monopoly..."

"event","Okay so maybe fixing things will work. <b><font color=""#808080"">I'm trying.</font></b>

Scott was perfectly normal with me tonight. In fact we were fuckin around having <font color=""#808080"">a lot</font> of fun, and when I drove him home he gave me a hug and kinda held my hand for a few seconds afterwards. It was one of those things where I wanted to kiss him <font color=""#808080""><i>so bad</i></font> but knew it wasn't a good idea.

Mark didn't get a chance to talk to him, so he didn't.. But maybe he doesn't need to. I still need to talk to Mark, because tonight was full of ambulance calls and then we all put on a movie at the building that nobody wanted to miss. <u><font color=""#808080"">Weird</font></u> fuckin movie. So yeah then afterwards we went home so I couldn't talk to him. He's with Jeff righ tnow and I texted him asking him to call me after they were done so I can talk to him but I <font color=""#808080"">don't</font> think he's actually going to. So who knows? There's always tomorrow right?

When I'm around Scott it's like I want things to work out between us but then I come home and think about the whole situation and the drama and the bullshit that would come about and realize it's probably <b><font color=""#808080"">not</font></b> a great idea. But ya know what.. whatever. I don't care. Whatever happens happens.

The other day I got two biopsys done, I get the results in a week or so... Then I find out if I have skin cancer. Isn't that <b><font color=""#808080"">exciting</font></b>? The weird part is, I'm not even worried. I think Kurt was the most worried about it.. I don't really care one way or the other. If I do have it, well then I guess <font color=""#808080"">that sucks</font> and needs to be taken care of. If I don't, then my life is that much easier. There's a good chance I have it, but I don't care righ tnow. I don't know where this new attitude of mine came from, where i really don't give a shit, but I like it. I usually don't give a crap too much but I was always also really stressed out over stuff easily... How I can do both at the same time I <b><font color=""#808080"">don't</font></b> know. But lately I'm just kind of.. carefree, I guess. I'm hoping it's not a phase, because life is <font color=""#808080"">so much</font> easier this way. Except the fact that I don't care about school either, so I'm slacking.. <b><font color=""#808080"">extremely.</font></b>

Oh well whatever. Time to go <font color=""#808080"">think </font>and sleep."

"event","I had this weird out of <font color=""#808080"">nowhere </font>burst of being happy and hyper since I got lost in the city for no reason. It's slowly fading. But there's good reason.

When Joey kissed me the other night, Mark said he didn't care who I chose, but I have to <font color=""#808080"">pick one</font>. I told him about my reasons for not wanting anything with Scott. There's way too much drama going on, and it seems as if he's one of the main sources behind it all. But then Mark explained to me why that's not 100% true..  I don't want to pick Joey. I <font color=""#808080"">can't </font>pick Scott but at this point I don't know that I'd want to. I don't want to pick <font color=""#808080"">anyone</font>. I don't want me and Joey hooking up anymore. I want to fix my friendship with Scott and in some way prove myself.. I don't want to date anyone. I want to be friends with Joey and I want to be friends with Scott because he's one of my best friends.

Last night he came to the ambulance buildnig and he said a few words to me.. he was jokin around a little bit.. but he barely talked to me and it was weird. I asked Mark to <b><font color=""#808080"">please please please please</font></b> talk to him for me because I don't want him to hate me anymore, because I was getting really upset. I haven't been upset about anything in a while... So he said on the way bringing him home he'd talk to him. I'm goin to Mark's in 1/2 hour so I'll see what was said. I do really like Scott, and I feel bad.

I feel bad for lying to <font color=""#808080"">everyone</font>. I know it's no one's business what I want to do with myself, who I want to hook up with, where I want to sleep.. but everyone was assuming they knew and I was denying it.. And that was wrong.  Jeff was the only one I think who knows that me and Joey had been hooking up for a month or so.. but it's not that we were together or even <font color=""#808080"">PLANNED </font>on being together.. we didn't. But when Scott kissed me and I realized that he actually <font color=""#808080"">does</font> like me and thought we might get togehter, I didn't even go over Joey's at all.. I planned to stop that. But then Scott stopped calling and started kind of ignoring me.. so I said okay nevermind. Then he sees me at Joey's and flips out.. and I mean he had a reason to be upset in a way, because I was staying at my ex boyfriend's house. But at the same time I've explained to him before thatme and Joey are not togehter, blah blah blah

So I don't know.. I just want to stop things between me and Joey. So <font color=""#808080"">hopefully </font>I'll get that done within the next few days. I'll miss hugging him and sleeping over, but I realize now that I don't want that. I don't want a hook up, whether it be an ongoing thing like Joey or a one night thing. I'd rather just hook up with someone one night and then just be able to laugh about it the next day then get myelf deeper into a situation like this. It makes it<font color=""#808080""> worse </font>because of the way things went with me and Joey, and now everyone thinks that we're gettin back together. I don't want that. So I can't stay there anymore, and we cannot do anything anymore. I have <b><font color=""#808080"">no</font></b> problem with that, we'll see what he says.

But I don't care what he says at this point because if he really does love me like he says then he'll be <font color=""#808080"">fine</font> with us being friends. Hell he can go hook up with plenty of other girls he doesn't really need me. I don't think at this point me and Scott will ever be able to get together, but I just miss my Scott hugs and talkin to him on the phone.. and in a way I guess I was deceiving him but I didn't realize it or<font color=""#808080""> intend</font> on doing that. So I need to talk to Mark about this and I need to talk to Joey.. and then <font color=""#808080"">maybe</font> things with Scott will work their way to being all better. I hope so. And I hope this doesn't get to Kurt the wrong way and <b><font color=""#808080"">him</font></b> get mad at me.

I need a hug lol. God.. I feel like I'm becoming way too much more trouble than I'm worth. And joey even said this is all coming about because Scott's had this crush on me. So I feel like I'm the cause of all this drama and I didn't mean for anything. I think I need to move somewhere far far away and meet new people and everything will fix itself."

He's causing problems between this person and that person.. and now hates me <font color=""#808080"">again</font> for hanging out with Joey, and seems to think I need to explain myself.
Is he fucking <b><font color=""#808080"">kidding</font></b>? No way am I getting involved with someone who's actually going to get mad at me for hanging out with someone. Yeah me and Joey went out.. but since I found out Scott does like me and I actually wanted to work things out with him, me and Joey hadn't done <font color=""#808080"">anything</font>. In fact Joey <b><font color=""#808080"">KNEW</font></b> me and Scott liked each other and told me that if it'll make me happy, to be with Scott. But I don't compromise my friendships for <font color=""#808080"">any</font> boyfriend.. Whether it's a freiendship with a guy, girl, or ex boyfriend, it <i>doesn't matter.</i> 

So now he's pissed off at me cuz I stayed at Joey's last night. I drank last night, I was'nt about to drive home with cops swarming the road AND I'd been pulled over <b><font color=""#808080"">already</font></b>. So we're gonna have a little talk tonight. I'm gonna try to get him to stop hating me and just let us be friends liek we were. But I mean now I look and see how Scott and Johnny and Motts were trying to ruin mine and Joey's friendship because apparently Scott's liked me for a while and they knew that and they were tryin to set us up. I couldn't understand completely, but Joey made it sound like he's liked me since either me and Joye started going out <i><font color=""#808080"">(a year ago)</font></i> or since before we started tot alk again, which was what.. a couple months ago??

So I mean I do like Scott, but I'm not putting up with this shit. I'm not with Joey, and I'm not with Scott, but I'm not gonna be with <font color=""#808080"">anybody</font>.. There's too much drama and bullshit and too many problems.. So I'm just gonna make it clear that I'm friends with everyone, but I dn't have to be dating anyone. In fact I don't want to date anyone til I'm <b><font color=""#808080"">out</font></b> of college which is next May. So until then I'm gonna do what I want, have my fun, party, hook up with who I want to.. I'm not gonna be a slut.. but I mean I'm not gettin involved in the relationship thing..

I mean I <b><font color=""#808080"">love</font></b> Joey, absolutely love him, and I always will, obviously. but I don't know if the love we once had means anything to him. He pulls that <i><font color=""#808080"">I'll always love you</font></i> bullshit, but I dunno. It's a little wierd. I think I might just stop the hooking up with him, and in a year and a half when he says we can try again, we can try a <font color=""#808080"">REAL</font> relationship again. And hell, that's only if things change a little bit.

Last night I met Mark, Scott, Andrew, and Mike at the diner. We ate, and <b><font color=""#808080"">just</font></b> as the waitress was gettin our check they got an ambulance call for some two year old who fell off his bunkbed. So Mark threw me his credit card <i><font color=""#808080"">(haha I could have done some damage with that)</font></i> and I went over to Kurt and Lisa's to wait for them all to get back. Ended up staying at their house from 7:30 - 11:30.. Mark and Mike got back there around 9ish. So the five of us were just hangin out, bullshitting, I was hyper as<font color=""#808080""> <b>hell</b> </font>jumpin around sitting on Mark's lap.. it was <b><font color=""#808080"">so much</font></b> goddamn fun. and then we started talking about how my cousin wants to kill Joey when he gets back here from Montana..

So Mark was like <i><font color=""#808080"">""well if he kills Joey you can have a new boyfriend</font></i> Because Scott apparently really does get bothered when I'm hanging out with Joey because it looks as if me and Joey are back <font color=""#808080"">together </font>and he likes me. Of course I find this out now.. I <b><font color=""#808080"">REALLY</font></b> liked him for the past few months before I even talked to Joey again so all was fine and good.... and I still really like him but of course it comes out when me and Joey are hanging out again. So Lisa was like <i><font color=""#808080"">""Who? I know someone who really likes you Meaghan and he is such a sweetheart""</font></i> and I was like <font color=""#808080"">""stop i dont' even wanna know'</font> lol and so later on Mark just straight out said that I like Scott. So Kurt and Lisa said <i><font color=""#808080"">""that's so cute because he has such a crush on you, you have no idea what are you waiting for</font></i> lol So i was like okay that's good...

So that's good, except even if I just hang out with Joey on FRIEND terms I dont' want Scott gettin annoyed. so we'll see what happens.. but i do really really really really really really really like him. a lot... 

And theyre right. He's an absolute<font color=""#808080""> sweetheart.</font>

So last night my plan was to get <font color=""#808080""><i>completely</i></font> trashed.. but I didn't. Once I got to Mike's everyone was kind of tired and dead and I was having decent fun just throwin a football back and forth with John and Chris, so I did'nt really feel like drinking. Plus I have my family reunion today and I had to drive home last night, so I decided not to. And it's a <b><font color=""#808080"">damn good</font></b> thing I didn't..

Joey called around 11, and asked if I could pick him and Mark up at the bus terminal at the end of the bridge in an hour.. so i said <font color=""#808080"">sure why not</font>.. going there doesn't require actually driving <u><font color=""#808080"">in</font></u> the city, I don't mind. So I leave and get on the bridge, no big deal I wasn't lost.. but then I missed the ramp I needed cuz the fuckers next to me wouldn't let me over in time.. so at that poitn of course everything going through my head was <b><i><font color=""#808080"">'holy shit, fuck, this is bad, what the FUCK am I going to do I'm gonna end up so lost that I'm here all night""</font></i></b> It got worse when I started seeing signs for Queens, Harlem, Long Island.. I had NO idea where the fuck I was going.. So I got off at my first exit.. at that point I was almost crying. Got into the city and started driving around desperately trying to find my way back to Manhattan. Couldn't get in touch with Joey or Mark, and had no idea Mike and Jenn were with them so didn't call either of them.. So I called Jeff, told him what roads I was on and he said <b><i><font color=""#808080"">""Bitch you're in Washington Heights get the FUCK OUT NOW""</font></i></b> So I said okay asshole if I knew how to I <font color=""#808080"">WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW. </font>I was hoping some cop would pull me over or something so he could tell me where to go, cuz there were a LOT around.. but unfortunately none of htem did.. So I tried calling Caitlin, couldn't get through.. stopped on some random <b><font color=""#808080"">creepy</font></b> dark side street that had a building on the corner with bars on all the windows lol and that gave me the hint I wasn't in such a great area.. so I caleld Sarah, NIcole had her friend Barry call me.. So I thought I had to get to the port authority on 42nd street.. so he tells me how to get there.. 

So I'm driving, the street numbers are going down, <i><font color=""#808080"">lalala all is well</font></i> I'm on my way.. Joey calls and tells me I need to get back to 181st street cuz thats' the terminal they're at, and I'm going <b><font color=""#808080"">WAY</font></b> out of the way. So I call Barry back up and he tells me exactly where I need to go. I turn around, get back on the bridge, find my way there, and parked til all their stupid asses could find there way to the car. So they got in, and I thought all is well, they know where to go,<font color=""#808080""> <i>the hard part is over.</i></font>

Well<font color=""#808080""> I was wrong</font> because right when we get to the road we need, an unmarked cop car pulls me over. Three guys get out with their <font color=""#808080"">hands on their guns</font> ready for a shootout I guess and start askin me questions. So I'm tellin him how I got lost, I was just tryin to pick them up, I'm not from around there at all and have <u><font color=""#808080"">never</font></u> driven in the city at all and I was freakin out, so I was probably driving like an idiot. So he was just kinda finding out what we were doing, asking some questions, but he was bein <font color=""#808080"">really </font>nice. So then he goes <i><font color=""#808080"">""Well you know there's no rights on red in the city right?""</font></i> I was like<font color=""#808080""> ""But.. I didn't make any rights..""</font> and hes like <i><font color=""#808080"">""well when you were lost you did..""</font></i> lol so I realized he'd been following me..

So We thought everything was fine, he told us how to get back to the bridge, and then one of the guys pulls Mark out of the car adn start searching him.. didn't find anything.. <font color=""#808080"">thank god </font>they didn't find his knife in his pocket. It's not a huge one it's just a little pocket knife but he's a firefighter, they all carry one around. Then they pulled out Joey.. found nothing. I wasn't scared <font color=""#808080"">at all</font> cuz I knew none of us had anything or had done anything wrong.. but Mike and Jenn were <b><font color=""#808080"">freaking out</font></b> in the back seat.. Personally i was just thinking <i><font color=""#808080"">wow this sucks but it doesn't surprise me in the least</font></i>. I'd done my share of freaking out though when I realized I was just a little 17 year old white girl who doesn't know wher she is or where shes' going is on her way to Harlem and lost in Washington Heights by herself.. So they pull me out, didn't search me just had me stand at the back of hte car.. pulled out Mike and Jenn, searched them, had us stand there and they searched my car.. And of course found nothing. It was fuckin FREEZING out too.. lol the one guy felt bad and made mark and joey give me their coats.

So the one guy was like <i><font color=""#808080"">""You know you were in all the worst areas tonight right??""</font></i> I was like <font color=""#808080""><i>""How long were you following me for??""</i> </font>he laughed he's ilke <i><font color=""#808080"">""At least 20 minutes, probably more""</font></i> I was like <i><font color=""#808080"">""<b>I WISH</b> you guys had pulled me over like 1/2 hour ago</font></i> He was like <font color=""#808080""><i>""Yeah you had a cop behind you at the light too and then he went next to you and left""</i></font> I was like <i><font color=""#808080"">""I know I was hoping he would pull me over </font></i> lol and they were laughing and had the other four get int he car.. so then the cop tells me the reason we got pulled over is because they had gotten a call about someone in a red car pulling a <b><font color=""#808080"">knife</font></b> out on someone, but there were 4 different descriptions of the car so they couldn't relaly tell exactly what car it was..  So we realized that me parking, them <font color=""#808080"">running</font> to the car, and us driving away, me not knowing where I'm going, probably <font color=""#808080"">did </font>look like they just stabbed someone and were on the run and I was the getaway car.. And the areas I was in were all the areas that people come over the bridge, get their drugs, and leave.. So I <font color=""#808080"">definately</font> didn't look legit.. So I completely understand where they were comin from.

So he let us go, they were all <b><font color=""#808080"">really nice</font></b> which was good.. and we got home. Dropped them off and then spent the night at Joey's..
Now I'm home and I can't wait to tell Katie my story cuz I know <font color=""#808080"">exactly</font> what she's gonna say.. haha

"event","Okay this newfound love for country music is <b><font color=""#808080"">really</font></b> beginning to worry me..
Oh well!

So Joey called from work at 12:30 last night just to say hi.. I was half asleep but we talked for like an hour.. and <i><font color=""#808080"">still</font></i> managed to talk about more than I thought we could lol. A lot of it was just random stuff.. then we got into the <font color=""#808080"">'us' </font>subject again
Talked about the next year 1/2, and reinforced the idea of <font color=""#808080"">neither</font> of us being able to be in a relationship, but he said he could definately see us being friends with benefits for the time being, and see how things progress over time.. and we'll see where we're at when the time comes for us to be able to be in a relationship. I could <font color=""#808080"">definately </font>see it happening. I mean we both know a relationship would not work at this time... but we miss each other.. and hey the benefits part is just.. well, a <font color=""#808080"">benefit</font>? lol 
I don't know. I'll just let whatever happens happen. It's that whole follow your heart thing I guess. If one day I feel I really don't want to be how we are, I'll cut it off. But I like the way things are now, and it's <i>completely</i> up in the air. If I go somewhere and meet a hot guy and hook up with him, there's nothing holding me back or making me feel bad, except the fact that I'm completely in love with Joey. If he goes to a bar gets drunk and ends up in bed with some girl, it <b><font color=""#808080"">doesn't matter</font></b>. If I find someone or he finds someone in the meantime.. yea that may suck but whatever.. it's whatever comes along.

it's <font color=""#808080"">hard</font> for me to explain but it makes sense to me. This is our time to get ourselves set, figure out what we need as far as our <b><font color=""#808080"">lives</font></b>, not relationship wise, and in the meantime just have some fun, as much as we can. And plus once he's in the academy and I'm in medical school, we both have <b><font color=""#808080"">no lives</font></b>. So why not live it up <font color=""#808080"">now</font>?

And plus, it's senior year, and I promised Crissy we'd make this worthwhile. So I'm gonna have my <b><font color=""#808080"">fun.</font></b>

So i'm supposed to meet up with him tomorrow around 9:30. =)
Oh yeah and we also discussed how <font color=""#808080"">wierd </font>our situation is.. the way it's come along. Meeting each other, being friends, liking each other, falling in <b><font color=""#808080"">love</font></b>, things going downhill, me absolutely <font color=""#808080"">hating</font> him, us being okay, to being friends, to coming where we are now.. can we say.. <b><font color=""#808080"">soap opera</font></b>? lol"

Went to Mike's last night after going to the mall with Mark and other Mike. That was fun. Mike got Jeff a glass checker shot glass set for Christmas and I begged him to let us have it tonight to use it but he said no. It's ok though cuz I wasn't in the mood to get trashed last night. Though I did get drunk/high enough to the point where me trying to put together the 3D horse puzzle was pretty fuckin funny..

Joey called, he was so drunk.. he came to Mike's so we could talk. That was sooner than I thought. So we went in Mike's living room, and after like 1/2 hour he layed down on my lap cuz he couldn't sit up anymore, but we did talk about a lot. In fact we talked about everything. I think the past few weeks me and him have talked about so much shit that there's nothing left to talk about as far as us and what's been on my mind. It's all fun from here lol. I really did say everythign that I feel and that I've been thinking. Anything I've written in this journal? Yep, it was said, or at least the whole point of it was said. I left nothing out because I was getting my answers.

He's not fuckin with my head. Well, as far as I know and have been convinced, he's not. We discussed us getting back together, but definately in the future. We both realized we need at least a year and 1/2 to ourselves, with him going to the police academy in like a month and a half and then gettign himself set up as a full time cop.. and me finishing out my senior year the best i can, livin it up, and startin college. I start college August 1st and until June I am going to be so busy because the program I'm in is so freakin intense and you miss one class you're screwed.. but that's what medical's about I guess. So we both discussed how after we've got ourselves set up, and don't have so much to focus on, maybe we can try it again. We both miss it, and we're gettin a lot cooler than we were..

So maybe in a couple years, we'll get another shot. As it stands right now, we're in a good spot. Though it was a little wierd cuz I stayed at his house last night and we definately hooked up.."

It's time to step back and look at everything, and see how it all <font color=""#808080"">really </font>is
I'm beginning to realize a lot of stuff that I didn't want to.. but I think i kind of knew all along.

Like the people in my life who really are <b><font color=""#808080"">assholes</font></b>
The ones putting on the acts
And <font color=""#808080"">especially</font> those fucking with my head. Joey's on top of that list, <b><font color=""#808080"">big time.</font></b>

The firemen, the EMTs.. they're all pissin me off a bit. I liked Scott <i><font color=""#008080"">a lot</font></i>, but even him... I love him to death, but there's some things he'll say sometimes that I just gotta <u>walk away</u>. Johnny's just Johnny, he goes back to the coast guard tomorrow. Brian, Tommy, big Mark, all of them are drunk men <i><font color=""#808080"">(one who has an 8 year old son)</font></i> but I absolutely <font color=""#808080"">love</font> everyone down there cuz they're so fun.. it's just hard sometimes I dunno. I don't really know how to take some of the things they say because Mark and Kurt and Andrew and Scott and Kristel, they're all great.. so I don't know.

Tonight I'm goin to Mike's with Jeff and everyone so hopefully that'll be fun. I can hang out with some real people.. who I know won't just be looking at/talking about my ass and fuckin with me. It should be <font color=""#808080"">fun.</font>

This Joey situation is <b><font color=""#008080"">really</font></b> gettin to me. For a while I thought I really wanted to try it again one day. And I still can't imagine the rest of my life <i><font color=""#008080"">without</font></i> him which is strange. But ever since we started talking again I find myself slipping back into the<font color=""#008080""> <u>stress</u> </font>and tension that I was in the last few months of our relationship. I was so happy and doing so good with the <b><font color=""#008080"">moving on</font></b> thing when we weren't talking, and now that he's back and pulling me back into his little game I'm not doin so great. My life would be easier if we were still in the <font color=""#808080"">not talking-me hating him</font> stage, but I definately <b><font color=""#008080"">do not</font></b> want that. I wish he would make up his mind as to whether he's gonna keep it friends or not. I know what I want but I don't know what he's doing.

I don't know his intentions, if maybe it's just fun for him.. like once I get so stressed out that I decide I won't put up with it anymore, he acts all sweet and charms me <font color=""#008080"">back</font> to him. Power trip?  I really don't know. But I <b><font color=""#008080"">seriously</font></b> need to start doing what's better for me."

Fuck him. We're not together, I like to pretend we never were, and we are never going to be again
Last night at the damn Christmas dinner and the firehouse afterwards I was basically the topic of all conversation and they all started so much drama over me and I didn't even know what I did!!!
I had a drunken Joey apologizing left and right and tryin to kiss my cheek and rub my stomach cuz I had to sit on his lap so we could all fit in the truck to go to the diner, a pissed off Johnny cuz he 'likes' me and thinks i'm fuckin around with joey but wants me to realize Joey's just tryin to feed me bullshit, Joey tryin to warn me from Johnny and keep him from using me for ass, Johnny and Richie bitchin out Joey for fuckin with my head and planning to use me, Scott listening to Johnny thinking I'm playin games with Joey's head and them all thinking me and Joey are fuckin around

And what the hell can I say to get them all to realize that me and Joey are nothing? Yeah sometimes he'll say or do something thta brings the feelings back, sometimes I hope maybe we'll work it out one day, but over the past few days I've reailzed how much I don't want to be with him again, and I'm just friends with him. I explained to Scott and Johnny that I'm not going to give up the friendship we had before we went out because of how shit went down when we went outl. And it doesn't help that I'm beginning to really like Scott again

But I don't want the reputation of the bitch who comes around and fucks around with people. Then I got Scott tellin me Johnny likes me but from past comments from Johnny adn the way he is, I of course see that he just thinks i'm hot and wants some ass before he goes to the coast guard.. Especially since last time he was here (about two weeks ago) he had a bet he'd get ass from me before he left. And the thing is, Scott knew he had this bet goin and we joked about it cuz it was fucked up. They all seem to not realize that I don't like getting involved in the drama, no matter how much it seems to be about me. I don't like getting involved because it's not worth it. They're all my friends, but I haev to always watch what I say and do, because clearly it all gets turned around somehow

I will <b><font color=""#808080"">never</font></b> understand how a guy can be so in love with someone, and the two of them can be so set, have such a future to look forward to, and they know each other <u>so well</u> but then one day he just lets it all go for some bitch he barely knows.

I was gonna sleep at Joey's tonight, cuz I was gonna be drunk, but some huge fire is goin on, four towns got called out to it so we're not doing that. And plus I had nowhere to leave my car and I have work at 9 in the morning. 
He's <font color=""#808080"">so weird</font>. So I'm just gonna see him tomorrow night at the Christmas dinner.
God when I talk to him and I'm around him I just want things to be how they were. Well I mean I <b><font color=""#808080"">always</font></b> want them to be how they were, but when I haven't talked to him in a while, I convince myself that I can do better and I'll find someone and that I can just move on and be happy without him. It takes a <u>while</u>, and it takes a lot to get me to stop thinking about how I feel about him, but somehow I manage. I'll tell ya it takes <font color=""#808080"">a lot</font> out of me though..

But then when he's back, I just realize how much I'm still in love with him.. and how much I'd give to just be with him again, to lay in his arms again, fall asleep next to him, just get it <font color=""#808080"">all back..</font> 
So at this point I just don't know what to do with myself.

"event","This hurts. This is so confusing, but it's beginning to hurt me. I was <font color=""#808080"">hoping</font> to avoid this.

Last night Joey was at the ambulance building.. and we decided to finish our talk that we had when I was drunk and puking. God we talked about<font color=""#808080""> everything.</font> I said everything that I had already said, so he knew I meant everything.. and then we went on this <u><font color=""#808080"">long</font></u> trip down memory lane.. I cried a lot. Him and his girlfriend broke up yesterday, and he said that his mom was really happy and said <i><font color=""#808080"">""good now you go back out with meaghan""</font></i> lol and he was like <i><font color=""#808080"">""ok mom, you call her up and arrange that.""</font></i> and then he told me something that just brought me to crying <i>hysterically.</i>

When I was puking, my hair was half up half down.. and I remember him taking a hair band from my wrist to pull the rest of my hair back.. and so yesterday he asked me if I remembered, and I said yeah.. and he goes <i><font color=""#808080"">""I don't know how you'll take this, good or bad, but as I was looking at you and holding your hair back, I realized that I'd forgotten how beautiful you are.. it's like when you listen to a song a lot, and then you don't really hear it much anymore, and then one day you hear it again and you're like 'holy shit' and you just wanna keep listening to it over and over again""</font></i> Of all times for him to see me as beautiful, he sees it as I'm puking my guts up in his toilet.

We just talked about so much, and half the time he sounded as if he wanted to one day get back together maybe, and then the other half he was sayin stuff lke <font color=""#808080""><i>'I know that we'll never ya know.. be again.. but I'm still gonna look out for you and be there for you.. and i'm always gonna love you""</i></font> And then I asked him, finally, if he'd ever cheated on me.. and he looked me in the eyes, and he said <i><font color=""#808080"">""no, i would never do that. I never did.""</font></i>
The worst part? <b><font color=""#808080"">I believe him.</font></b> Because I could always tell by the look in his eyes whether he was being completely truthful to me or not. And I could see in his eyes.. he wasn't lying. But then I realized that Mark Andrew and Scott had all told me he cheated on me. So I asked them about it again, but this time they had <font color=""#808080"">no idea</font> what I was talking about and said they don't know if he cheated on me or not but they never witnessed it. 

And what got me.. we were hugging, and I was crying, and he started to wipe the tears off my face, and then he started rubbing my face. I used to wake up <font color=""#808080"">all</font> the time to him just running his hand over my face, rubbing my cheek, or my eyes, or my chin... sometimes he would just do it cuz he said he loved to feel how beautiful I am.. I thought I would <b><font color=""#808080"">never</font></b> feel that again.  I just looked in his eyes and forgot how much I love them. It took so much for me to not kiss him right there.  He wanted to know where we go from here. <font color=""#808080""><i>I don't know.</i></font>

Tonight he came down to the building, we were all just hangin out.. and then me and him went to A&P to walk around. Bout canoli's and ate them in the little cafe area thing.. he told me he's gonna be single for a wihle since he goes to the police academy in February and that's gonna be rough. And I've just been thinking so  much it's <font color=""#808080"">killing me..</font> 
After all the talking we've done, all the feelings are back, and I wish I could be with him, so bad. I know if I did there would be some <font color=""#808080"">serious</font> problems.. it's such a complicated situation. Like Crissy said, we were so in love it's not even funny, and anything as great as we were deserves a second chance, but there's so much more that I don't wanna get into that just tells me it would never work. My mom already told me after what he did he'll <font color=""#808080"">never</font> be welcome in this family again. But I don't know, It's just that I am so in love with him still, and I don't want to just not talk to him anymore, but at the same time to hang out with him is so hard. It's not that it hurts, but this whole situation just hurts.. and I want to ask him if he thinks maybe one day.. in the future.. way future.. we could make it work. I'm afraid of his answer though.. and I'm afraid he'll think I'm trying to get back together with him right now.. but this is just so hard.. and <font color=""#808080"">so</font> overwhelming

Thursday we were supposed to have the talk. I sat at the ambulance building with Mark, Mike, Costas, Johnny, and Richie from 6:30 - 11:30 that night. Joey showed up around 7:30/8ish. I was waitin for us to have this talk..We watched Ladder 49 <i><font color=""#808080"">(which by the way is the first movie that has ever made me cry.. it was the saddest movie I've ever seen and I wanted to give every fireman I know the biggest hug. But there were only 3 there so I hugged them lol)</font></i> So I figured we'd talk afterwards.. nothing. We watched TV the rest of the time.. funny shows.. but around 11:15 he says he's goin home. So I'm lke <i><font color=""#808080"">""so uhh joey when did you plan on having this talk with me?""</font></i> and hes like <i><font color=""#808080"">""uhh can we do it another day I completely forgot""</font></i> I was pissed but whatever I'd enjoyed myself.

So Friday me and him met up at the building around 2. Sat on the steps and he talked. He talked and talked and talked and apologized so much for <font color=""#808080"">everything </font>he'd done to me. For the way shit went down before we broke up, the way he broke up with me, and the way he treated me afterwards. He said I'm such a great girl and he wasn't lying when he said he loved me, and one day I'm gonna make someone <b><font color=""#808080"">so</font></b> fuckin happy and he hopes that guy is 100 times better than him and kicks his ass in everything. He explained a lot of his reasoning behind a lot and basiclaly just took the time to apologize and say how stupid he was. 
So I accepted his apology, asked him a lot of questions I needed answered, and said <font color=""#808080"">a lot</font> that made him feel like shit. Drilled into his head how much he really did hurt me and fuck me up, explained how i was for the month after we broke up.. but decided against teling him in person that i knew he cheated on me and that he's gay. Or, bi at least. I did that cuz I <b><font color=""#808080"">know</font></b> I would have hit him or at least started yellin and shit, and I have more respect than to do that down at the building.  He also told me that he still <font color=""#808080"">does</font> look out for me..becuase half the guys down at the firehouse he knows just want me to go over there so they can stare at mea nd my ass.. and he bitched out johnny the other night for callin me to go over htere just so they can all stare at me. Johnny's like <i><font color=""#808080"">""fuck u dude you two aren't goin out""</font></i> and hes like <i><font color=""#808080"">""fuck you I don't care you still don't fuckin treat her like she's a piece of meat cuz she's not asshole""</font></i> So it's nice to know <i><font color=""#808080"">someone's</font></i> lookin out for me.

So I said what I needed to, but we hadn't decided yet where we're gonna go from here. Either not talk at all, or be friends. I didn't know what I wanted. I think thta's cuz I hate him but I love him too. Mark came down, Joey went home to change.. and then while me Mark Scott and Johnny were eating they got a rescue call cuz some guy was on the cliffs ready to jump off and kill himself. I had texted Joey and said <i><font color=""#808080"">""What I would have been yelling at you for is that I know you weren't completely failthful to me when we were together.. but forget it""</font></i>
So Joey two-wayed me as I was leaving and begged me to go pick up his sister at CVS cuz he had brought her there but had to rush back to the ambulance and he could have been gone up to 3 hours depending on if the guy jumped or not <i><font color=""#808080"">(which he didn't..)</font></i> So being as I love his sister I said sure. I picked her up, we went to BK, drove her two friends home, and I drove her home. He also said we'd discuss what I texted him about when he got back.. and thanked me 400 times for bringing her home

So I go to drop her off and I said <i><font color=""#808080"">""Jennifer do me a favor give your mom a huge huge hug for me cuz I miss her so damn much.""</font></i> And she invited me inside. So I went in to say hi and her mom's eyes filled up with tears, I <b><font color=""#808080"">almost</font></b> started crying and gave her such a big hug. she was tellin me how much she missed me, how pretty I am, talked for a little while.. I played with their new dog, and gave her mom a hug goodbye and tried <i><font color=""#808080"">so hard</font></i> not to cry on her. The <font color=""#808080"">minute</font> my hand touched that doorknob though the tears came <u><font color=""#808080"">streaming</font></u> down my cheeks. So at that point I wasn't pissed anymore, I was upset.

Got back to the building cuz they came back since the guy didn't jump.. Hung out there for a while, Joey wasn't back yet cuz he had to go bring the guy to the mental institution. I left, he called me to come back and talk. So I got back and met him out front. So I went over and told him how Jenn had let me go in and say hi to his mom.. I started crying as I was telling him, I guess cuz it was just an<font color=""#808080""> <i>extremely</i></font> emotional day and I miss all of them so much.. So he gaev me a hug which made me cry more..

And then I said <i><font color=""#808080"">""ya know what Joey forget it. Forget about when we went out. Forget the lies, the crying, the arguements, the fighting, the fun, whether or not you cheated on me because I know you did </font>(when I siad that he looked down at the floor and away.. so yeah he definately did.) <font color=""#808080"">And just.. forget about it""</font></i> and he was just like <i>""um.. aright..""</i> And I held out my hand, and said <i><font color=""#808080"">""Hi I'm meaghan""</font></i> and he smiled and shook my hand and said <i>""Joey, it's nice to meet you""</i> and gave me the <font color=""#808080"">biggest</font> hug and I went <u>hysterical</u>, I could not stop crying. He thanked me about 5 times.. I couldn't say anything at that point. So as I was walking away, he said <i>""i won't hurt you this time.. I can't""</i> and I said <i><font color=""#808080"">""good""</font></i> and that was that.

So we're cool now and I'm forgetting what an asshole he was, or, is, and just moving on with it. We may go out to lunch one day to catch up on the last few months,and now it won't be wierd when we're all hanging out. I'm very proud of myself for not punching him in the face, flipping out, and realizing that this just isn't worth it and to fuckin <b><font color=""#808080"">forget</font></b> about all the bullshit.. Because in 10 years, it <font color=""#808080"">isn't going to matter.</font> It's not worth throwing away a friendship because I'm still mad. Because we weren't just boyfriend girlfriend, we were friends, and we were <font color=""#808080""><b>great</b></font> friends. 

Other than all that, it's been fun. I temporarily left the theater until after new year's so I can stop workin 50 hours a week. Still <font color=""#808080"">really</font> like Scott and the situation is all the same with him. Johnny's back so we've been hanging out, played some pool, got completely <font color=""#808080"">TRASHED</font> last night at Mike's house.. me, mike, danielle, jeff, matt, diego, nicole, and chris.. it was so funny. It was one of the best nights, the ones you don't remember half of. I woke up in Mike's bed and he was on the floor but I remember passing out on the couch. I know I puked, I don't know whath appened to my lipgloss, I don't remember taking my belt off, and<font color=""#808080""> <b>somehow</b></font> my earring was in my back pocket. 
So i went to work with the worst hangover ever, puked 8 or 9 times while I was at work and then felt much better. I remember dancing my ass off though. That was fun.  Oh and my <font color=""#808080"">ass</font> was the topic of conversation at one point about how I'm the little white girl with the huge ass.. I remember that.  Ah yes, I smoked too. I woke up to see Joey had texted me because he was drunk. Glad we can be back to that level.

I got homework and then my ass needs to go to bed. I'm fuckin <b><font color=""#808080"">dead</font>.</b>

OH YEAH! Kurt Scott and Johnny took me up in the firetruck ladder today. 85 feet up it was so freakin cool. They said we'll go up one day on a really clear day up at the lookout where you can see EVERYTHING and it's awesome. I love them =)"

Whatever

So Jeff told him I like him and he said he just can't do that because I'm like his best friend and he's afraid if we go out and then break up things are gonna be wierd between us.. and he sees how me and joey are and that's the <b><font color=""#808080"">last</font></b> thing he wants. So It's one of those I like you you like me but we're afraid to do anything about it things.
So then Jeff talked to his brother. LoL he's like <i><font color=""#808080"">""Ya know my friend Meaghan really likes your brother.. ya know the short one with the brown hair""</font></i> and his brother's like <i>OH SHIT! The hot one with the fat ass??</i>  lol jeff's like <font color=""#808080""><i>""yeah that one""</i></font> hes like <i>""shit how can my brother get someone like that but I can't? I'd fuckin hit that.. shit I'll talk to him he's stupid if he doesn't go for her""</i> lol 
But I texted him today and got no answer.. and when I saw him for <b>5 minutes</b> last night I didn't get my usual huge hug it was a high five and then he left.. and Kristel said he was acting wierd all night. So I don't know. Maybe it was better for no one to say anything. It doesn't matter anymore.

Joey was at the ambulance building the other night.. me and jeff were in the room drawing my 3rd <font color=""#808080""><b>best</b></font> snowman while mark and scott worked on mark's car. Joey came in and Jeff left.. so in my attempts to <font color=""#808080"">ignore</font> Joey he starts up a conversation.

<font color=""#808080""><i>""Ya know I've been wanting to talk to you for a while...""</i></font>
<i>""Oh that's nice.""</i>
<i><font color=""#808080"">""well.. are you okay?""</font>
""uh yeah peachy fuckin keen thanks""
<font color=""#808080"">""Well I mean, that one day I called you.. you were really upset""</font>
""yea I'm fine""
<font color=""#808080"">""Okay.. ya know, we can still talk and stuff..""</font>
""Well ya know what Joey I found out a lot of stuff that makes it a little um.. --""
<font color=""#808080"">""--wierd?""</font>
""Yeah sure, wierd works.. a little wierd to talk to you""
<font color=""#808080"">'oh.. ok..""</font>
""yeah..""</i>

And he walked out.. I felt bad for <b><font color=""#808080"">2 seconds</font></b> when his face got all sad when I said I didn't wanna talk to him, and then I remembered how he cheated on me and lied to me and led me on and treated me like <i>shit.</i>  I didn't feel so bad after that.
Then he started telling Mike how much he feels bad and just wants to be friends with me again, because we had a <b><font color=""#808080"">great</font></b> relationship he just didn't want something that serious at this age, <i>blah blah blah</i>. So Mike relayed the message to me. So I gave in, my being sensitive and a little bit <i>too nice</i> kicked in and i told Joey last night if he really has taht much that he feels the need to talk to me about, I'll give him one night and I'll listen. 
So he said he'd <b><font color=""#808080"">really really</font></b> like that and we decided on tomorrow night around 9-ish. I know I'm gonna end up flippin a <b><font color=""#808080"">shit</font></b> on him. In fact my fear is that I'm gonna end up hitting him or punchign him so I have to keep my distance. I know it's gonna be an emotional night forme..

So I told Mark he<font color=""#808080""> better</font> be around for afterwards, I'm gonna see if Scott and/or Johnny will be around too. Johnny <font color=""#808080""><i>probably</i></font> will be if the other two aren't cuz he just stays out all night and gets drunk for the time that he's back. This is <b><font color=""#808080"">definately</font></b> going to be intersting.

I'm quitting the movie theater tomorrow, <i><font color=""#808080"">I can't wait.</font></i> I really can't. I thought about staying but that's just not going to work. I'm startin to fail calculus so my mom doesn't want me to have two jobs anyway so maybe i'll stay awake in class from now on.. i'll work 40 hours a week as opposed to <b><font color=""#808080"">50</font></b>. Good idea.

I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my mind again, I'm PMSing <font color=""#808080"">horribly</font>, and I've been feeling so <font color=""#808080"">wierd</font> lately.. I don't really enjoy this.

Goodnight.

But haha.. <b><font color=""#808080"">no</font></b> lol nothing against him that just can't happen. Just thought I would clarify that..

Today was fun. Worked with Nicole.. I'm so happy she works with me now. It was boring as hell at work.. we got to fill bags with rocks.. <font color=""#808080"">oh joy</font>. But Saturday since none of the bosses are there except Jen she said I can bring in my pieces of wood I cut out and we can glue the sand and stuff on and start making my beach wall =) i love Jen she's the best..<b><font color=""#808080"">especially</font></b> when she's hyper lol
Then after work I went down to the ambulance building and played 500 Rummy with Scott Mark Andrew and Mike. That was <font color=""#808080"">really</font> fun. Kristel came down, then jeff and sarah came down. Some lady donated a basketball hoop to the ambulance corps that she didn't want anymore but they needed a longer pole so they could put it in the ground.. so me scott and mike went with kristel to the warehouse thign her dad owns.

that was <b><font color=""#808080"">SO FUN</font></b>. lol me scott n mike were playing on the forklift and playing with everything we could find and it was the greatest thing ever. Scott is <font color=""#808080"">so damn cute </font>I like him so much lol I feel like I have some stupid 6th grade crush but he really is adorable. I <font color=""#808080"">definately</font> had fun tonight just hanging out with them. And tomorrow I'm gonna go down there and help dig the hole and fill it and stuff since I dont' have work til 6:30.

Speaking of work I really really don't think I'm gonna be at the movie theatre much longer.. <i>I can't take it</i>. It's killing me, I have no energy left anymore, I can't get up in the morning, i feel like a fuckin anti-social fucker especially on the weekends, and I think they're only paying me like half of what I should be getting anyway. It's not bringing in enough money fori t to even make a difference..
And my mom said if I want she'll pay like $100 of my car insurance a month that way I can take a break since she can see I'm burning myself out. I <font color=""#808080"">might</font> take her up on that just for a few months so I can get some money in the bank...

And plus me n crissy decided today Montana is <font color=""#808080"">definately</font> on, July 7th. It'll be about $400 for gas if the prices remain around the same that they are now. Then again I did'nt take into consideration the prices of gas in <i>OTHER</i> states.. lol oh well. So far the only people definately going are me, crissy, and sarah. Jeff may not go, Nicole says she definately will but I'm not positive when it is.. it might be the same week as cancun so she might not go.. and we haev to ask danielle if she's going. Then we figure out whose cars we're taking. Jeff and Sarah and Danielle I think are goin to Nevada to find sarah's parents afterwrads though so I dunno.. we need to find a couple more people to go.

I need to exercise n go to <b><font color=""#808080"">sleep.</font></b>"

So this has been the week from <b>hell</b>! All week my boss insists on making fun of me for being short and tellin me I'm fat. I know I'm not cuz I'm 5'1"" <i>(yes i know that's short)</i> but I'm 105 pounds. but it still gets <u>SO ANNOYING</u> to have your old crazy boss telling you everyday you have to stop eating cuz you're fat and how short you are. <b>No shit</b> asshole I know I'm short. Do you think I haven't heard that my ENTIRE life? Suck my dick.
So on top of that, I couldn't get my paycheck from the theatre on Friday cuz of some bullshit so I had to wait til today to get it in the mail. I <b>finally</b> get it and find out my bank account was closed cuz my balance went to 0 which I didn't know. Had to re-open it but couldn't take any money out of my check. So I was on <i>empty</i>, had to still get doug for work, go to work, make it back to his house, and make it home, and make it to school tomorrow. <u>wasn't gonna happen.</u> So I told him I wasn't bringing him unless he had gas money since he has yet to give me any. His mom brought him.  <b>Douchebag!</b>

So my dad gave me money cuz he could see I've been freakin out cuz Doug's been an asshole all week, I've been stressed out as all <b>hell</b> about money, I worked <b>50 hours</b> this week.. what 17 year old works 50 hours in one week plus goes to school? So the fact that I feel like my social life and all my energy is disappearing hasn't helped at all. There's more but I don't feel like bitching.

But this morning I'm on AIM on my phone and Craig IMs me. Craig is the guy I went out with 3 years ago but he was black so parents and cops freaked out cuz im white he's black, <i>blah blah blah</i> we were called white trash my mom and dad stopped talking to me tried to move us to a white town, whatever. Let's just say it was a <b>huge</b> mess but the best summer of my life all at the same time..
So now I've been talking to him all day which is weird cuz I thought he forgot I existed so that's cool. 

Went to the ambulance building last night and <b>JOEY</b> was there!! that didn't make my week any better. But he left haha <i>I win</i>. But he erased my snowman!!! I drew the coolest snowman 2 weeks ago on the marker board there and it was so colorful and pretty and it said <i>""To Mark, Scott, Andrew, and the ambulance people cuz I LOOOOVEEE YOUUUU <3 Meaghan""</i> and he erased it and wrote ""Erased by Joey"" I was like um not funny. So i redrew it and labelled it Snowman Part Two. Ass.

and I found out that Mike and mark brought Joey to a gay club the other night and he had his hands down <b>several</b> guys pants, was dancing with all of them, making out with a bunch of them tellin them not to tell his girlfriend. I asked Mark if Joey did the same thing when I was with him. He said yes.
That's <u>absolutely disgusting</u>. I want to take <b>6000</b> showers right now. But I just took one.

Oh and on top of it all my Calculus book was in my car and as of 5 days ago it was gone. So I have to buy a new one.. that's like $50 right there. But hey $200 of my paycheck tomorrow and I'm out of debt to my mom.. Until of course my car insurance bill comes in a few days. and I think the movie theatre only paid me for one weekend of work not two so that pisses me off.

So I'm just gonna have to blast my music to drown her out. I haven't talked to her in almost a year and she still manages to drive me absolutely<font color=""#ff0000""> <b>nuts.</b></font>

I'm so unbelievably sick and tired of working 36-48 hours a week and going to school and yet still having not enough money to<font color=""#ff0000""> feed myself</font> for the week. and my mother goes shopping once every three weeks so there's no food in the house. When she does go shopping there's barely enough food in the house. But I don't blame her for that cuz she's poor too. I guess this is just me bitching cuz I'm tired of this.

My boss is being a complete cocksucker too. He's sittin there telling me that I'm getting fat. So I said excuse me but I'm 103 pounds.. what would you like me to be? at 5'1"", I should be 105. When I lost weight after Joey everyone told me how much weight I needed gain.

Went to get my paycheck at the theatre tonight after being stuck in stand still traffic for an hour.. so I was already extremely irritated.. Ramone tells me the auditor came and I had to come between 3:30 and 5:30 in order to pick up my check. Does it take a genius to think of maybe CALLING ME to tell me this, so that I can get there to get my check? So now I gotta wait for the asshole to mail me my check. I was really excited to eat too.

So my dinner was one of those weird nutrition bars my mom buys and a kit kat I stole from my little sister's Halloween candy. I'm fuckin hungry. I'm waitin for Jeff and Danielle to come here.
Yeah so I did really like scott.. well I do.. but my chances with that are definately zero now. Katie came down and managed to get Andrew and Scott to both want her which is what usually happens.. so yeah. My mom suggested Katie doesn't come down anytime soon. I love Katie but whenever she comes down, even though I know it's not intentional, she manages to flirt with a guy or two or three that she definately should not and they end up liking her and yeah. Last tiem she was down it wasn't even someone that I liked.. but Nicole now doesn't want Katie coming down if we're gonna be hanging out with a certain someone.. and I think Britney feels the exact same way.
So from now on I'll just go up there.. 

But whatever. I'm in a pissy mood after the traffic I had to sit in wihel it was pouring and I couldn't see the lines on the highway for 2 1/2 hours and I ended up taking a wrong exit.. blah blahblah. So yes.. not a very cheery entry. Sorry."

So I worked 25 hours this weekend. What bullshit. LoL. Saturday night brad's brother was managing though so it was more fun. 
Friday night and Saturday night after work I went over to Mike's and slept at Nicole's. Drank some on Friday didn't drink Saturday cuz I was exhausted and driving.  Beat up Mike, danced, had some cool talks with Steph Danielle and Mike.. 
Went trick or treating with jeff, meagan, vicky, danielle, and sarah for about 15 minutes and then was supposed to meet up with Scott.. but I think he got an ambulance call, he never called me back.. so I'll see what's up maybe I'll see him tonight. That would be fun. ha i'm such a loser.
Oh yeah Johnny called he was back from the coast guard for last night and the night before and I was supposed to go meet up with him before he left last night but I was waitin for scott to call and couldn't get in touch with Johnny and he left around 9. So he said we'll have to hang out when he's back for Thanksgiving, so that'll be cool.
Now I must go get Doug adn go to work. I can't wait til this fucker gets his car fixed.

But I went and it went really slow but Jeff visited so it's okay.

Then went over to the school from 7:30 - 9:30 for the 8th grade orientation thing.. had to speak a little about drafting and just sit there and work on my project so the kids get the idea about what the class is about. I didn't know I was gonna have to speak at all but luckily Mr. McWhirr talked about most of it...
Umm then went and got Jeff and Sarah, and went down to the ambulance corps.  Mark, Scott, Lisa, Mike, and Kristelle were there. I'm not fond of Mike <font color=""#ff0000"">or </font>Kristelle.. but oh well.

"event","John is like texting me every twenty minutes and calling me at least once an hour sometimes more. Well he wasn't so bad today.. but Jesus Christ! It's a little bit <font color=""#ff0000"">scary</font>
Mike said <font color=""#ff0000"">Round 3</font> is Friday.. I was beatin him up on Saturday lol we were goin at it just punchin each other and it was fuckin <i>fun as hell</i> so Round three is <font color=""#ff0000"">definately</font> Friday. And Danielle's never gotten drunk with me so there's the plan. And if I have work.. then I just wait til afterwards. <font color=""#ff0000"">I love them. </font>
So today was nothing special.. at all. Neither was yesterday. The day before was fun cuz we were down at the ambulance building adn I was really hyper and so was Scott adn Scott is seriously my new best friend lol I have so much fun with him we were goin nuts. 

So as far as the kid I was thinkin I'm starting to like.. well yeah I <font color=""#ff0000"">definately</font> do and it is <font color=""#ff0000""><u>SO WIERD</u> </font>lol but I haven't said anything to anyone cuz I dunno. God it's so crazy lol I told stephanie just now and of course I got the <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""aw that is so cute</font></i> I love her. Anyone else would probably tell me I'm fucking <font color=""#ff0000"">crazy</font>.. but whatever. Whooo knows

I miss my cousin. And I almost kinda sorta miss Johnny too as much as he's an <font color=""#ff0000"">asshole</font>.. lol he was actually pretty cool to me, even though half the time he was hitting on me. JB in the airforce and Johnny in the coast guard. Maybe the military just needs to <font color=""#ff0000"">stop </font>stealing the cool people lol defiantely just kidding. Oh well. They'll both be back soon enough. 

I'm bored. I'll probably get a phone call from John sometime tonight.. god.. he's nice but i do <font color=""#ff0000"">not </font>want him thinking i like him cuz I don't but I'm not gonna just stop talking to him ya know? oh well"

"event","I find this odd.. this is one of my<font color=""#ff0000""> favorite</font> songs right now but it's a country song. Since I met Joey and Mark I've heard <i>so much</i> country that I began to not mind it and I actually liked a few songs but this is like my favorite right now.. weird.

So it was an <font color=""#ff0000"">interesting</font> weekend. Katie's ex who wanted her to put a good word for him.. well I went up just to play pool not as a date just to catch up on the past four years as <font color=""#ff0000"">FRIENDS</font>, because I do <u>not</u> feel the same way about him that he apparently does for me. He keeps leaving voicemails that begin with <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""hey beautiful""</font></i> and saying how much he wants to hear my voice and stuff.  A little weird if you ask me since we've hung out TWICE. But whatever..
So i get up to Katie's on friday, and he had another hour of work so I went on deliveries with him.. well his ex girlfriend of a year 1/2 was there who he juts broke up with two weeks ago. She proceeded to scream countless amounts of names at me, I was called a <font color=""#ff0000"">cunt</font> about 60 times, an std whore, god so many other names.. and I have <i>NEVER MET HER BEFORE.</i>

So I'm sittin out in John's car waiting for him to come out and she decides to come sit with me. I told her me and john were FRIENDS I've known him for 4-5 years,  we were never and aren't and won't ever be <font color=""#ff0000"">anything </font>more than friends, we haven't hooked up, will not hook up, and whatever no matter what he may have to say about it. She was <font color=""#ff0000"">very</font> drunk and decided to tell me how much she hates me anyway. It was very interesting. Apparently she thought wed had sex and we hooked up and I wanted him..  I don't know. She still doesnt' believe what I was saying but I don't care.. I was laughing the <font color=""#ff0000"">whole</font> time. It was fun. Then me and John played pool. It was fun. I won 3 out of 4 games.. GO ME

Then Saturday i worked 9am-11pm. Planned on going home to sleep afterwards cuz I was so exhausted but Nicole called and told me to come by Mike's.. so I was going to <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""stop by.""</font></i>
Well me stopping by ended up being me walking in, becoming hyper as hell, and dancing for<font color=""#ff0000""> <b>HOURS</b></font>. It was me, Nicole, Jeff, Sarah, Mike, Diego, Eric, Caitlin, David, Rob, Matt, and.. that's it.. went<font color=""#ff0000""> crazy,</font> it was so much fun. eventually I was the only one with the energy to keep dancing and stay up so Jeff and Nicole took turns gettin up and dancing with me haha I haven't actually<font color=""#ff0000""> DANCED </font>like that for so long since probably 8th grade, and it was so fuckin fun you have <font color=""#ff0000"">no idea</font> it was such a nice change. I felt alive again as <u>corny</u> as that sounds.
then me nicole and jeff went to the diner to get food cuz me and nicole were STARVING. Got my usual BLT and a chocolate milkshake.. we drove around for a little bit and i got in around 4:15..

Fell asleep around 5:30, so I got 2 hours of sleep before I had work at 9 am sunday morning. Worked 9-5 but Danielle didnt' come in and Justine only worked 9-1 so I was by myself at the register from 1-5 when it was busy as <font color=""#ff0000"">hell</font>, so Jen had to come up once in a while to help out cuz the place was swarming with people. That tired me out.. But did I go home and go to sleep like I planned? <font color=""#ff0000"">Of course not.</font>
Went to the firehouse to meet up with everyone to find out that kristelle <i>(who is 19 and should be more mature)</i> told two 12 year old kids to put a stink bomb in jeff's car. So they did. I would too if I was twelve. So the night was spent cleaning that out. 

I got hyper as hell again, so me and scott took an umbrella handle and started spinning around and jumping around and going crazy having <font color=""#ff0000"">so much </font>goddamn fun lol he's my new favorite it was so fun. Oh on Friday I went to the cliffs around 2ish and it was really nice.. just needed to do some thinking and some writing.. and it was so fuckin <font color=""#ff0000"">beautiful </font>up there. A little cold but pretty nonetheless.

Tonight was spent at the ambulance buidling after work with Jeff, Mark, Scott, and Andrew, it was fun. A lot of running around and bein hyper.. and then scott chased me down the road not knowing I get an asthma-type reaction thing when I run in the cold.. in fact I think the doctor called it <font color=""#ff0000"">cold-induced asthma</font> lol so I was coughing up a fuckin lung for 1/2 hour lol it was funny. I should be doin my english paper that's due wednesday that I didn't start yet. I don't really want to. I'm eating peanuts.

I just dropped a peanut down my shirt. Ten points for me. haha I don't wanna go to school tomorrow I skipped todya cuz i felt like shit. My head is <font color=""#ff0000"">killing </font>me still. I spilled milk on my phone now it's all fucked up i can't text or two way people.

I'm beginning to like someone I think.. and I'm gettin the same vibe from him.. but it's one of those things that i'm like.. weird.. <font color=""#ff0000"">never </font>thought that would happen..don't know that it should.. but who cares? If I like him I like him.. But there's some reasons why it would be weird if anything were to happen.. but at the same time we'd kick ass. Ya know? It's like ya want it but you're afraid of it. 
But I also realized that after Joey I'm kind of afraid of relationships period. Not just because of him. But because of the boyfriends I had, the situations I found myself in, and the guys I've been involved with.. but Joey made it 10 times <font color=""#ff0000"">worse</font>.. especially since he was a sweet heart at first. Now the nice guys scare me away too."

As of right now I've been awake for <b><font color=""#ff0000"">34 1/2</font></b> hours. I got 15 minutes of sleep probbaly all together in jeff's car at 6 in the morning.  

I worked yesterday for 11 hours. <i>(4 of them were with the cute boss lol so it was okay. we established the fact that i'm vertically challenged and got many interesting conversations off that topic.. and the fact that we were working with three guys who had NO common sense and we were both amazed. it was funny)</i> So anyway.. around 11:30 me, Jeff, Juz, Nicole, and Sarah went into the city. Got stuck in some <font color=""#ff0000"">serious</font> traffic.. so what did we do?

<u>Blasted early '90s dance music</u> that they used to play at the roller rink and made sure all the windows were down and we just danced and sang and got a few people to dance and sing and clap with us. We made it the<font color=""#ff0000""> <b>funnest</b></font> traffic ever.

So we were there til around 2:30.. it was aright except I had like shin splints up through my <font color=""#ff0000"">entire</font> legs from standing for so many hours.. Juz and Nicole got their noses pierced, and Sarah got another ear piercing. Got some gross McDonald's, sat in the park with a buncha people we made friends with by talking about Barbara Bush and Rats.. <b><font color=""#ff0000""><i>?</i></font></b>
So we got back and decided to go to the diner. It was me Nicole and Jeff and we were there for 2 hours because we were<font color=""#ff0000""> delirious</font> and our waiter was an asshole who got no tip... so we just told fucked up stories and shit especially about work. There was a girl there with her friends celebrating her 23rd bday and they were completely RIPPED so we had conversations with them about 80's cartoons.. had to call Juz to see what Strawberry Shortcake's enemy's name was <i><font color=""#ff0000"">(haha juz you made their night they were so happy lol)</font></i>

So yeah.. then we drove around for a while.. at 6:30 I decided it was <font color=""#ff0000"">pointless</font> for me to try to sleep.. cuz I had to get home by 7:30ish, take a shower, get doug at 8:40 and be at work by 9. So.. I didn't sleep. I dozed off for a couple minutes but that's it. Went to 7-11 and got <font color=""#ff0000"">NoDoz</font> caffeine pills.. took two of them and I was good.. fuckin <b><font color=""#ff0000"">hyper as hell</font></b> at work it was great
I'm still kinda hyper yet really tired too.. goin out soon with Jeff and Lisa I think.. <i>maybe not</i> I haven't decided yet I'm pretty damn tired. I'll go out for a little while. 

Umm Johnny two-wayed me <u>again</u> yesterday but I was at work so didn't answer and I haven't gotten in touch with him since.. I thought the other day he was maybe just callin to see what I had to say about Joey and that maybe they were in on it.. but I guess not? So then Mark called and I heard quite a few <b><font color=""#ff0000"">intersting</font></b> things from him that I'm not allowed to repeat but I know will um.. come out <font color=""#ff0000"">eventually</font>.. probably sooner than later
It's been interesting.

And tonight no seeing yellow cuz Juz said it's like family night or somethign.. so hopefully TOMORROW!!!! I have to get DJ his rubber chicken tomorrow since i FINALLY FOUND ONE AFTER <font color=""#ff0000"">4 YEARS</font> OF LOOKING lol"

But this song is so fun now I love it. This, and Jump by Van Halen. And So Far Away by Crossfade.. those songs seem to bring me up a lot lately

Got a random as all hell call around 4 today from Johnny.. he's in the middle of the ocean right now on a boat cuz he's in the coast guard lol guess he was just calling to say hi.. found out me bringin doug to the firehouse<font color=""#ff0000""> pissed </font>joey off beyond belief which is what I was aiming for so that makes me feel better lol. He knew I was fuckin with him but whatever. At least he cried later on cuz he thinks he realizes how much he hurt me. <font color=""#ff0000"">Enough about joey.</font>  So Johnny'll be back again in.. two weeks I think he said.. lol talked to him about life and stuff, he's aright.. then kurt randomly called me too to see if I had fun at the firehouse on Saturday at the big party so that was cool.. But definately must see Johnny when he gets back again cuz I didn't get to give him a hug goodbye or wish him luck lol I forgot he was leaving last time. Except this time I'll ignore the fact that his last goal was to <font color=""#ff0000"">fuck me </font>before he leaves, because that just <b>isn't</b> gonna happen.. lol but besidest that he's a pretty kickass guy

I babysat last night for the first time in <font color=""#ff0000"">two years</font>, and those kids got so big one's 3 and one's 5.. it was <font color=""#ff0000"">SO GREAT</font> lol I missed them <i>so so so so so</i> fuckin much. I can't believe Alyssa remembers me since she was a year old lsat time I saw her.. but hell that's cute. Anita (the mom) came home and I talked to her for a good half hour updating her on everything.. we talked about  A LOT i l<font color=""#ff0000"">ove</font> talking to her. So we decided hopefully i can go over there more often. 
Didn't work at WR today<font color=""#ff0000""> for once </font>cuz they realized i'm not allowed to work 7 days a week and I'm alreayd workin 6 there.. so yeah. I was contemplating quitting the movie theater and working at Jen's boyfriend's garden shop, except that I got my paycheck tonight.. and I got $62 for working <font color=""#ff0000"">FOUR HOURS</font>. Apparently that happens a lot and you make more money than you should... good shit =) So I might stick around for a while lol sicne my pay is supposed to be $5.75/hour

But now my feet are killin me cuz I worked for 5 hours tonight.. <i>Might</i> be goin out later if Jenn Jeff and John get back from the abandoned mental hospital anytime before like 3 but the odds of that are slim and the chance of them calling me.. even less.. but if not I'm goin to bed cuz I got work for 11 hours tomorrow.

I want to be <font color=""#ff0000""><b>so fuckin drunk</b></font> right now. Hopefully that will take place tomorrow night after 11:30 cuz that's what I work til.. 
I've still been doin so much thinking lately but I think it's a good thing. OH YEAH and um Jenn's boyfriend John has a friend James who they want me to meet, and she said he's so sweet, and looks like he came right out of the military which is a good thing. I'm not really picky I've gone out with every  type of guy you can  think of probably.. the hispanic, the black, the white who wants to be black and it's just <font color=""#ff0000"">obnoxious</font>, the white who grew up int he ghetto so he can <font color=""#ff0000"">almost</font> get away with it, the punk rocker piercings all over in a band, the cop/emt who was a little too gay apparently.. the one who was extremely much too preppy so that lasted 3 days.. lol not that they were all <font color=""#ff0000"">long</font> relationships but still.. i dont' really go by their 'category' i guess. So I'm thinkin I should definately meet this fellow.

<font color=""#ff0000"">AND <font color=""#ffff00"">YELLOW</font> IS HERE TOMORROW</font>. i'm workin all fuckin day so if i can't see her tomorrow then i defiantely must sunday. So excited =) stupid fuckin arizona"

This song is one of the greatest songs in the world right now I think. I'd like to sing it to Joey.

My schedule for WR this week is Mon-Thur 1-6, Sat 12-6, and Sun 9-5. That's <font color=""#ff0000"">awesome</font>. I'll be exhausted but that's money and <b>lots</b> of it. Then I work the movie theater Friday and Saturday 6:30 - 10:30. More money! I mean of course I don't keep more thanl ike 20 bucks of it but hey I'm down to $560 in debt to my mom.
So sore from yesterday I havent' done that much running and dancing in <font color=""#ff0000"">forever</font>. My hips hurt the most from <i><font color=""#ff0000"">hipping</font></i> mark and that other guy that I don't know but he picked me up and I almost got dropped into the garbage can lolol. He said his is on fire haha. Mark's awesome as a friend (well in terms of being fun anyway..) but when it comes to him and jeff I think he's a fucking asshole. But that was so fun last night I cannot believe it. I made so many friends =) haha they were so fun though. And of course most of them were 21 or older so they were all drunk so me being this little hyper crazy loud fuckin girl running around just keeps them entertained. But most of them were staring at me and mark cuz we were dancing and me being his 'date' or so he liked to call it seemed odd to them since he's <font color=""#ff0000"">gay.</font> 
This part of my conversation with Joey <font color=""#ff0000"">really pissed me off..</font> because it's like he knows exactly what to say to keep me talking and act like he gives a shit how my life is going and then what to say to upset me.. he always was good at settin me up for a downfall. And like usual, he can't juts leave well enough alone, he had to keep prying into me and making matters worse. I was having such a great night too.

<font color=""#ff0000"">Shithead (12:55:24 AM): hows the love life goin</font>
<font color=""#ff0000"">Shithead (12:55:31 AM): u dont have to answer that</font>
Me (12:55:40 AM): yeah that probably wasnt the bes question for you to ask.
Me (12:55:41 AM): but anyway.
<font color=""#ff0000"">Shithead (12:56:13 AM): is that becaue u dont want me to hear the answer or because...</font>
Me (12:56:32 AM): why woultdn i want u to hear the answer
<font color=""#ff0000"">Shithead (12:56:49 AM): i dont know why wouldnt u</font>
Me (12:57:19 AM): its just not a great subject. life's been a little bit sensitive lately and the love life aspect of it seems to be one of the main reasons as to why
<font color=""#ff0000"">Shithead (12:58:01 AM): when i say love life i dont mean love life i just been dating life</font>
Me (12:58:06 AM): i know that
<font color=""#ff0000"">Shithead (12:58:36 AM): sso whats the prob its just dating did u ever answer the question u were tryto when i talked to u on the phone</font>
Me (12:59:25 AM): u know my past and what its been like as far as dating. and it hasnt gotten much better. so i try to not think about it so i can be that fuckin happy person everyone wants me to be and i'd like to be.. and no i havent answered that question yet
<font color=""#ff0000"">Shithead (1:00:04 AM): right o

And until Joey just decided to IM me to say hi about 2 minutes ago, tonight was one of the <font color=""#ff0000"">funnest</font> nights I've had probably in the past year.

Went to the firehouse tonight for the afterparty after the parade that I didnt' go to cuz I had work..and <font color=""#ff0000"">OH MY GOD</font> lol for a good 2 1/2 - 3 houss I was just dancing fuckin <b><font color=""#ff0000"">CRAZY</font></b>.. I kept running into mark and slamming into his hip with mine and he was drunk as <i><font color=""#ff0000"">all hell</font></i> so he thought it was the greates thing in the world.. then just kept dancing and now the entire fire department probably thinks im a fucking crackhead lol. It was <u>so great</u>. made lotsa friends lol

And Oh my god.. the last time I actually danced that much adn was actually having fun with it was when me adn jeff danced in the parking lot of the gay club about <font color=""#ff0000"">a year</font> ago... it was just.. holy shit so much fun lol i was so hyper I couldn't believe it. And mark even pointed out tome how funny it was that me and joey <font color=""#ff0000"">never</font> had that much fun.. yet now I'm having the time of my life with my exboyfriend's <font color=""#ff0000"">gay best friend</font>. hahaha.
then ithought my car died at bk.. but it was a buncha switches with the alarm or something that i had to fuck around with.

I was really happy neither joey or matt was at this party tonight.. but now of course I couldn't get off that easy and Joey's IMing me. I <font color=""#ff0000""><b>hate</b></font> when he does that because I know how he is and it seems like hes juts fuckin doin it to rub <i><font color=""#ff0000"">something</font></i> in my face about how wonderful his life is.

So mark's friend mike has a friend they want me to meet but i dunno about meeting anymore of mark's friends. and jenn's boyfriend has  a friend they want me to meet. fuck it i'll meet <font color=""#ff0000"">everyone</font>. Joey's fucked up my life enough he doesn't <b><font color=""#ff0000"">deserve</font></b> to have been able to make me, or <font color=""#ff0000"">ANYONE</font> for that matter, being fucked up in the head about it anymore

Got my paycheck today that was over $300 so i'm givin 200 to my mom which brings me down to $500 in deb to her. Guess <b><font color=""#ff0000"">that's</font></b> a good thing.
I'll be working 39 hours this week. One more hour and it counts as full time.
So I'm 17 years old going to school with a full time job <font color=""#ff0000"">and </font>a part time job. How sad is that?

guys sorry if I've become a miserable <b><font color=""#ff0000"">asshole</font></b> lately to anyone
My life's become school, work and <font color=""#ff0000"">more</font> work and when I'm not there I'm completely <i>drained</i> of all energy so I'm not fun. I seem to find just enough energy to get me through school and work.. the rest is just me dragging myself along
I miss having fun with everyone. Don't think I don't <b><font color=""#ff0000"">want</font></b> to.. because I'd give anything to be able to. I remember who I used to be and how I used to be and <b>wish</b> I could be that person again.
<b><font color=""#ff0000"">I miss JB</b> and Katie.</font>
I miss knowing who I am since I've completely lost myself. I don't know who I am and I feel like I barely know my friends anymore.
The past few months have been <font color=""#ff0000"">hell</font> for me and I've been trying to not show it. I've become emotionally drained and although I used to be a strong person, I'm not anymore.  A certain few have taken that strength away from me after putting me through all the bullshit. A couple years ago I would've bounced back to my normal self by now. But that<font color=""#ff0000""> clearly</font> isn't happening. But I'm trying.
My headaches are back and my patience is gone, and day by day it's getting worse. The Joey situation usually gets easier with time, but the situation with what it's <font color=""#ff0000""><b>done</b></font> to me doesn't get any better.
So if I seem like a complete bitch to you don't take it personally. I'm trying to fix it. And to the <font color=""#ff0000""><i><b>few</b></i></font> who have actually been there to talk and/or listen, thank you. 

I figure by the end of December I'll be completely burnt out.. so I'm not sure what I'll do at that point. I wish I could just run, and keep running, and get <font color=""#ff0000"">out</font> of here. But once again, I can't do that.. too much responsibility here.

It was busy as all hell.. and after that, and yesterday, and friday, and thursday, I am completely <b><font color=""#ff0000"">drained</font></b>. I have no energy left. I never want to move again. My knees and legs and arms and neck and back are fuckin <u>killing</u> me. I worked 6 days this week and if I'd gone in Wednesday like I was supposed to it would have been 7. I dont' know how I'm surviving the whole s<font color=""#ff0000"">chool-work-work-work more than i'm supposed to</font> thing. 40 hours a week is considered full time. If I work 7 days a week come christmas time which I'm thinking I will be, I'll be going to school and working a full time job <b><font color=""#ff0000"">and</font></b> working at the movie theatre on the weekends. I didn't know that I could handle that bullshit.

But in a couple weeks I think this means I'll be able to buy clothes. I can't wait for that..

Talked to JB for 40 minutes last night.. updated him on lotsa stuff. He told me that one of his main life purposes when he comes home next summer is to find Joey and beat the <b><font color=""#ff0000"">shit</font></b> out of him, and he wants Doug to help and Doug wants to. <i>Obviously</i> I won't let that happen but it makes me feel better lol. Me and JB have always been pretty protective over each other but I guess there's always one family member you're extra protective over. Good shit. Oh and he's mackin it to Crissy lol wants her to move up to Montana. I promised him if my road trip plans work out we'll be road trippin to montana this summer. I miss him <font color=""#ff0000"">so much.</font>

I'm extremely tired. I need to read for english adn get some fucking SLEEP. So I'm not dead for <u>work</u> tomorrow."

The next I'm completely <font color=""#ff0000"">lost</font> again.

Right now I want to just run. Just start running and keep running until I <b>can't</b> run anymore. I would, except my legs are about to fall off. I was at work from 9-5 all day..  priced pumpkins from 9-1, stayed up front with keri lauren and tracey <i><font color=""#ff0000"">(pretty much to keep keri company cuz lauren and tracey are our two most obnoxious idiotic workers)</font></i> til 4, then priced more pumpkins til 5. Glenn was a little irritated cuz in his words <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""my two best cashiers are out here pricing pumpkins and putting out flowers.. and my two worst are running the register</font></i> but fuck that I told them I'd come in to price not to work the register.
Came home, took a shower, and had to be at work at the theater at 6:30.. stayed there til 10:30. Needless to say the only time I've gotten to sit down today from 9 in the morning til 10:30 at night was when I was driving to and from work. I didn't sit at work. My knees are fucked up already so today and yesterday and thursday didn't help <font color=""#ff0000"">at all</font>.. and yeah.. my legs too.

Because in the past 3 days I've been working so much physically, setting up at the store and lifting over 3000 pounds and then today all those fuckin pumpkins.. so many of them and now my arms are done getting their workout I don't think I'll ever need to work out on my arms. 
And I'm <b><font color=""#ff0000"">completely</font></b> out of it so I'm gonna keep rambling on.I had a BLT tonight at work it was good. And instead of asking if someone wanted butter on their popcorn I asked if they wanted popcorn. I think I'm on drugs and don't know it.

Um.. was supposed to hang out with Jeff but he decided he'd go to the city,<font color=""#ff0000""> again</font>, instead. Me and Nicole wree supposed to drink but couldn't get anything, so I thought we'd hang out anyway but she made other plans. Mark called but I'm not hanging out with Mark alone and getting hit on.. But he did say that he could <font color=""#ff0000"">probably </font>convince Kurt and the fire chief to let me ride in the firetruck in the parade. I don't really care one way or the other but hell that would be pretty cool I guess lol I'd feel so special because I'm not even and <font color=""#ff0000"">never</font> will be part of the damn fire department.. I bet they'd let me I do enough down there.

But back to where I started to ramble.. yeah if I could I was just start running.. and run my ass til I can't anymore and then I'll walk. But I don't know where I'd end up or when i'd get there or what. I could drive but the car needs to be in by 12 so that won't work. i might work tomorrow i don't know. I could either have a day off or go work with keri and justine and make easy money. i might make money. i wish danielle actually worked when she was supposed to that would be fun."

Except it's a little more than that.. cuz life isn't just a stupid puzzle. It's a really big logic puzzle. And it sucks.
Just as everything was figured out, it was all thrown away. Forget <font color=""#ff0000"">everything</font> that made sense once, because it doesnt' anymore. All that time taken to figure it all out.. was a big waste.

I was wrong. I lifted <b><font color=""#ff0000"">3,730</font></b> pounds altogether in 2 hours yesterday. And today was more lifting and pricing and setting up stuff. And tomorrow all day I'm pricing pumpkins and that's it. No register, just pumpkins. <font color=""#ff0000"">22 bins</font> of them. It's going to take the entire time from 9-6 I'm sure. Too much physical activity in 3 days. 
I got myself a new bag tonight since I hated the one I had.. got it from Pacsun and it's white and I like it. Me and Steph had a long talk with Danielle. She talked  most of the time cuz she was drunk and she talks a lot as it is... lol.

But when Danielle talks it's weird. Shes <font color=""#ff0000"">really good</font> at making you feel better but also making you think so when I think we all know what happens.

At least I got rid of them for 2 months.. But I promised Vicki there is no way in <b>hell</b> I'm going back to the doctors so they can give me that fucking medicine that turned me into a walking zombie. I wonder if I'd stayed on the medicine instead of just not taking it anymore<font color=""#ff0000""> for Joey</font> they wouldn't have come back. But once again, another stupid fuckin thing on my part.

Got my paycheck today from the movie theater. My boss said he wanted to personally thank me for doin such a good job cuz some spot checker came in and was extremely pleased, and we managed to get a score he'd <font color=""#ff0000"">never </font>seen in all the years he's worked here. So that's good.
It was $111 cuz I only work weekends.. so I kept 50 out of the bank and put the rest in. I stuffed my face since I <font color=""#ff0000"">barely </font>eat anymore, so I have 40 left. I might invest in a pair of jeans or something. Me and Jeff will go shopping this weekend.

Oh yeah.. we visited his friends at college yesterday and watched Mean Girls. We decided I'm Janice and Jeff's her gay best friend Damien. And the scary part is we fit the part <font color=""#ff0000"">perfectly</font> as far as the way they act. Except we would never attempt to kiss each other. ever. And I've never been accused of being a lesbian. But if I was I'd probably handle it the same way.  lol It was funny

October 2nd is the damn fire chief's parade. I promised Kurt I'd take off work cuz the fire chief gave me n sarah personal invitations to the afterparty and want us to go to the parade.. he said it's cuz i help out <font color=""#ff0000"">so damn much</font> down there even though i'm not part of the fucking fire dept lol. I <i>considered</i> joining til i realized i never wanna fight fires. ever. So from 12 pm to god knows wht time next Saturday I will be surrounded by firetrucks. Woo.. hoo.. Maybe if the firemen get drunk enough theyll gimme some <b><font color=""#ff0000"">beer</font></b>
Johnny left, I meant to thank him n give him a hug before he left but oh well. He'll be back in 9 months.  He told Joey that he should have expected his girlfriend to cheat on him, cuz he broke up with me for that skank. I thought that was funny. Thanks johnny.

Didn't go to school.. I woke up with one of those headaches where it hurts to <font color=""#ff0000"">open my eyes</font>. Got up by 11:45.. Can't go to work cuz with this work study program if we're absent from school we can't go to work. So I get a day off. 
Didn't get much sleep <i>at all</i> last night.. too much on my mind. To be honest I did some cryin too so that might have helped with giving myself a headache.
My mom thinks i'm gettin headaches from my job, that maybe there's some chemical or something since headaches are always around when im workin ther and the 2 months i wasn't there i had no headaches.. I was also <font color=""#ff0000"">happy</font> for those couple months though. I wasn't being treated like complete <b><font color=""#ff0000"">shit</font></b> from joey and for a little bit i liked working at the a&p.

I don't believe Joey cheated on me with a guy.  A girl, I'd believe that, or even believe that he just met this girl he's with before we broke up and<font color=""#ff0000""> that's</font> why he decided to break it off.
According to Mark he talked to Vicki and she said the only reason she said Joey was cheatin on me with matt is cuz she assumes he's gay cuz he broke up with me and ""you <font color=""#ff0000"">have</font> to be gay to do that."" That's what Kurt said to. guess that's a self esteem boost? Can't say I agree with it.. but hey whatever
I still think he's a little gay just from other.. things.. but <font color=""#ff0000""><i>anyway..</i></font>

His girlfriend thing Kat cheated on him, which is why he was crying and stuff <i><font color=""#ff0000"">(can't say I feel any sympathy at this point)</font></i>.. but he's gonna take her back cuz <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""she's sorry""</font></i> and realizes she fucked up and he cares about her or some shit. But, while he was crying he was sayin how he felt bad about what he put me through and realizes how much he hurt me. Newsflash dickwad, you will <u><i><b><font color=""#ff0000"">never</font></b></i></u> understand the <font color=""#ff0000"">half </font>of how much you hurt me. But I still don't hear an apology. He coudl at least tell me he realizes he fucked up and he's sorry for it. but no, not joey. 
So yeah..

That ruined my fun. and kinda ruined my day. At least Johnny told him that's what he gets for breakin up with me and going out with that skank. At least I know his friends don't like her. Immature yes, but it makes me feel a little better. I keep trying to think of all the <font color=""#ff0000"">negative</font> things about him. 

So i went to the firehouse and me and sarah spent a few hours with the entire fire dept and we were drawing on the little wooden firetrucks and then me and kurt painted them. When im in a bad mood i like to be around kurt cuz he keeps me happy. I think it's cuz I really don't wanna be unhappy around kurt cuz he's <font color=""#ff0000"">so fun </font>to be happy with lol cuz he has the mentality of an 18 year old. maybe 13 year old. but anyway lol if you're not happy around kurt he worries. or atleast, if <font color=""#ff0000"">im</font> not happy cuz the first 2 weeks he knew me i was fucking insane. i was actually really happy

So that kept me okay. Now it's time to go to bed and I really <font color=""#ff0000"">don't l</font>ike this part of the day."

So this week was fun but.. I guess you can tell it wasn't so great.

tonight hung out with caitlin and jeff. drove around dancing like an idiot in caitlin's car. then we went to the ambulance building
sat there with mark, johnny, scott, andrew, krystelle, nicky, tommy, kastas.. caitlin went home. 
found out that joey had left mark 12 voicemails <font color=""#ff0000"">crying </font>and shit while mark was at the firemen's convention the past few days. so he tried to call him and see what was wrong but he started crying and all mark could make out was <i>'<font color=""#ff0000"">everything's wrong'</font></i> and then he had to go to a meeting at 8. joey's dad also called and left mark a message to call him. 

So i came and read his away message and it said something like <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""working... so tired...so hurt..whether it is good or bad, I hope to make sence of things when i get home...smiling on the outside but dead on the inside""</font></i>
so i'm <font color=""#ff0000"">guessing</font> its his girl thing dumped him. the girl that him and matt were sharing. whatever. i just left him a message being nice sayin i was here if he needed to talk even thoughi knew he wouldnt want to. and as fucked up as it sounds.. if that's what happened to him, he knows how it feels now to be fucked over and he got what was comin to him after the <b><font color=""#ff0000"">bullshit</font></b> he pulled on me.

Went to Jenn's. <font color=""#ff0000"">lotsa people</font>. Brought Chris and Ilya with us to Jenn's. Jon, Meagan, Britney, Jeff, Megan, Vicky, Will, Jeanne, Amanda, Joey, some guy, Umm.. i dont remember
Back to Dan's to say hi and bye and happy birthday. Back to Jenn's for the night. Mostly hung out in the dining room with Chris and Ilya.  Chris tried to get me to dance and I started to and then realized i wasnt' drunk enough to. I like being <font color=""#ff0000""><b>stupid</b></font> but don't really like dancing unless u get me trashed. 
Mommy kicked us out cuz people were loud and stupid. Drama with Jenn and her mommy. Me Chris Ilya Sarah and Katie stayed and helped clean everything up. Threw the garbage in the dumpster at the underground. Talked to mommy and she <font color=""#ff0000"">finally</font> decided this shit isn't going on in her house anymore.. finallly got smart about it. 
Went to Nicole's. Me, Katie, Sarah, Nicole, Britney, Chris, Ilya, Jeff. That was fun. For <font color=""#ff0000"">some</font> times.

Of course this is the third time and there was another elaborate story to it all.  Then the nicole mommy kicked everyone out cuz she got smart and once the cops and ambulance came I think she finally realized she's responsible for this crap and cant' let it go on anymore.
Me Katie and Sarah went to the hospital to wait for him. Ate vending machine food for an hour, realized he wasnt' gettin out anytime soon so we left. Went to the dienr and got food. Came home by like 6 and fell asleep as soon as our fucking heads hit the pillow... now sarah's on the phone with jeff

Jeff and mark 'drama' last night. I hate Mark. More today, but I don't care. So I try to not get involved.
At 12:30 last night Joey called me.

I'm like half asleep and hear my phone ring and look down and see <font color=""#ff0000"">""Shithead""</font> calling. So I picked up and he was calling to see if I was okay, because my away message said <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""im losing.. my mind.""</font></i> So i talked to him for like 15 minutes and ended up crying.. more than I was already.
Basically just told him how confused I am lately and that I don't know what I want anymore or <b><font color=""#ff0000"">who I am</font></b>.. How I'm completely overwhelmed with every conflicting fuckin emotion that I have.. half of me wants one thing, half wants something else/doesn't know what the fuck I want. 

And of course, being Joey, he had to put in a little more than his two cents and give me 8000 suggestions. Seems to think that <font color=""#ff0000"">he</font> knows who <i><font color=""#ff0000"">I</font></i> am and that he knows what I need. Gave me dating advice telin me that I shouldn't be looking for a serious relationship and i should just <i>""wing it""</i> and date around and meet tons of people, blah blah blah.
Is he fuckin<font color=""#ff0000""> <i>kidding?</i></font> Yes, I have plenty of guys right now that I could just go on ""dates"" with, or fuck around with, or even go out with if I was desperate for a relationship. The difficult part isn't me finding a guy who would want to be with me <i>(not to sound conceited but I've definately gotten plenty of obnoxious offers)</i> The problem is me finding someone that I trust and want to be with. I mean first of all after the shit he put me through he has <font color=""#ff0000"">no right</font> to sit here and tell me how <u>I</u> should go about dating. And secondly, what if I don't want to go dating around? I've been put through <font color=""#ff0000"">so much shit</font> that all I want is a relationship that I can rely on. It would be nice to have someone I can finally trust for good and <font color=""#ff0000"">that</font> is what i <i>want</i> and<font color=""#ff0000""> that</font> is what I <u>need.</u> I'm the type of person who needs to feel like I have someone there for me. Yes I have friends but i don't want to put the burden of everything on them. When me and him were together he would listen to me no matter <font color=""#ff0000"">what</font> I had to say and was always there. He did actualy care about me that much at <i>one time</i>. That's part of being in a relationshp with someone. As much as I know I have friends for me, I'm not a person who wants to talk about every problem I have with them because people have their own problems to deal with.  He thinks at 17 years old I don't need that. Know what? <font color=""#ff0000"">Kiss my ass</font>. I know he was 'trying' to help but fuck that clearly he doesn't fuckin know me. He's proven that many times.

I also told him that I had a break from all this bullshit when I was with him for a few months, til he started treating me like crap.. but after the shit I went through with Doug and then him, i'm just back where I was <font color=""#ff0000"">before</font> I met him, and feeling a little worse off. He knows how fucked up I was before I met him.. so it shut him up real quick. I'm back to square one feeling as though I'm just dragging myself along.. trying to be happy for everyone else because that's how people know me and like to see me. The little happy hyper girl with kind of a bad temper who tries to make the best of things but is pessimistic at the same time. That is how people have described me and if that's what they wanna see then <font color=""#ff0000"">fine</font> whatever I wont let them see me upset. Make someone happy. 

I attempted to talk about it with Jeff today.. Jeff who is the one I <b><font color=""#ff0000"">thought</font></b> would be there to listen to me and talk to me and give me advice and shit.. he didn't say a word when I told him about 2 minutes worth of it.. we stopped at Danielle's to get money adn then as we were driving away he goes <i><font color=""#ff0000"">""not to bring up the whole situation from yesterday.. but that's really fucked up about mark""</font></i> and started talking about it. I didn't say a word cuz I didn't really wanna hear it. I told him how I feel about the situation, he told me earlier he is <font color=""#ff0000"">not</font> discussing it anymore cuz he <u>doesn't care</u>, and I was trying to talk to him as a friend .. and I thought maybe he'd actually give a shit enough to listen to me.. but once again, it all goes back to being about <b><font color=""#ff0000"">him</font></b>. Like it <font color=""#ff0000"">always</font> is. He wonders why I didn't want to talk to him about it earlier.

So now I'm going to bed, probably to think about some more. Oh yeah and I came to the conclusion again todya that me and Doug are definately going to be <font color=""#ff0000"">no more</font> than friends. Fuck that. That's at least one thing I have figured out.. that I don't want to put myself in that situation again. and dont want anything more with him. Maybe I was all happy cuz I had juts gotten out of a relationshp and talking to him again was a relief and brought me back.. thinking maybe I'd be happy this time. Isn't gonna happen."

Doug started work today.. <u><font color=""#ff0000"">God loved me</font></u> lol so they liked him, he did good. I expected him to fuck it up as horrible as that sounds.. but he didnt' and they said they might need him this weekend. That's a good sign

So I did <b><font color=""#ff0000"">a lot</font></b> of thinking.. and after last night's thinking and this morning's thinking I'm not really sure what I want. I mean Doug's definately changed for the better but I kinda decided I want to just be friends with him. As much as I wanna just hug him and kiss him again when I'm with him.. I think I need to give my emotions a break for <font color=""#ff0000"">a while.</font>

I mean for 2 1/2 years I haven't been really single. Doug for a year and 1/2 and then joey for 8 months. That's ok 2 years and 2 months.. but whatever you know what i mean. It's been a <u>long time</u> and I've been put through a lot of shit. Joey<font color=""#ff0000""> <b>completely</b></font> did me in and I realized this morning that I am so overwhelmed with everything I'm feeling about everything.. that I'm just confusing myself even more.

I ended up in a depression with Doug, mostly because of the emotional stress and confusion.. I don't wanna fall back into another one. But I mean Joey.. god that's just such a fuckin crazy situation. I was starting back into a serious situation with him.. the eating and sleeping problems, the depressive-ness. Talking to Doug again.. that's a lot of what helped me snap out of it just cuz itw as a relief to talkt oh im again. And finding out Joey was a douchebag helped too, but at the same time it didn't.  I mean yes, I laugh about it. I find it <font color=""#ff0000"">hysterical </font>but still when I lay down and think about it, it fuckin <u>hurts.</u> I remember the old joey and just so many thoughts run through my head. I think I kinda wanna think about Doug so I can stop the pain from Joey adn the conflicting feelings and shit.. but at the same time relationships bring about so much stress and bullshit and I can't take this crap emotionally anymore. I mean I'm one who loves to be in a relationship but if it's something like this.. do I <font color=""#ff0000"">really</font> wanna get myself into that again?

So I think Doug working with me, as backwards as it sounds, may make it easier for us to just stay friends from now on. I think maybe I actually do just need some time to sit back and focus on<font color=""#ff0000""> myself</font> and clearing my head and figuring out who the fuck <b><font color=""#ff0000"">I am</font></b> since I honestly have no clue anymore. I mean the past few months have really fucked me up and I'm not enjoying it.

But other than that.. we get to visit Kurt tomorrow that should be fun.. Jeff was told everything about Mark tonight but that's a whole new story, they're starting over or whatever.. Johnny's back from the coast guard for 2 weeks and apparently his goal is to fuck me before he leaves but we all know that <b><u><font color=""#ff0000"">isn't</font></u></b> going to happen.. and yeah.. work with danielle and doug tomorrow and that should be fun. 

I need to <i>try</i> to let myself sleep."

"event","Today on the way to work I listened to... nothing.
That's not entirely true.  I listened to the sounds my car makes, the massive amount of wind noise normally drowned out by the stereo, the whine of winter tires on dry pavement.  The clicking of the shifter, and the pressure sounds from the clutch pedal.

The whole way there I felt nothing.  I don't know if that's better or worse than feeling sad.  As I left my house, intentionally NOT turning on the stereo, I couldn't help but expect to be completely lost in my thoughts by the time I got to the thruway.  I anticipated the deafening silence giving way to the same kinds of thoughts that keep me awake at night.  But there was nothing.  I just drove, focusing on driving, and not much else.  It was strange.  Going over the bridge, the sky was clear and the water was blue, and it was aesthetically pleasing but I just didn't care one way or the other.  The world was moving around me and I was moving within it, but it felt like something was out of sync.  Actually, that's not a bad way of describing how I've been feeling most days for the past month.  Maybe the music helped cover it up for a short time, twice a day.

My New Years resolution is to let go of the person I was and craft something new.  Time to shed some skin.  The me from 2008 clearly wasn't enough for Lauren, and to be honest since that all went down I haven't been the same person anyway.  Even if things do work out in the end, that's a scar that might heal and fade, but never go away.  That's not the point, though it is related.  When Lauren called in November, she said I needed to ""figure out who I am"" and had to ""be OK with myself"".  Prior to that conversation I wasn't aware that I had any issues with myself.  But I was stuck, and a change certainly wouldn't hurt.

What better way to accomplish those tasks than to build myself from the ground up?  How am I going to accomplish that?  I'm not going to get super specific.  With this kind of Do It Yourself project there's bound to be some modification and improvisation.  It's more like cooking than engineering- start with a solid foundation, add some key ingredients, and finish with some spice for flavor.

<lj-cut text=""Some broad goals:"">

Improve my health.  Going from Not In Shape to Better Than Not In Shape would be good.  Achieving ""In Good Shape"" would be awesome.  Also, I'm going to get contacts again.  Getting a new vision prescription counts as a health issue, and although it might partially be vanity, having them will increase my confidence.

Get some certifications.  2008 me doesn't have 'em.  2009 me will.

Improve assertiveness and confidence.  I've always been a laid back, indecisive person.  I mesh well because I can go with the flow and adapt.  That's a great way to avoid conflict, not such a great way to make a lasting impression.  There's a school of thought that says ""The only way to get what you want is to take it.""  While that's one extreme end of the spectrum, another way to get what you want is to ask for it, and not be afraid to.

Step out of my comfort zone.  I'm a creature of habit.   Although on any given day I'd be up for doing anything, going anywhere, or experiencing something new, if my keys, phone, and wallet aren't in the right pockets (left, right, back right) it'll seriously throw me off.  I'll start by changing the little things like that, and although I can't think of too many great examples at the moment, I'm going to look for patterns in my routine and shake them up.  At the very least it'll introduce some change into the mundane, and maybe offer a new perspective.

Exercise the power of positive thinking.  Yes, I know that sounds uber cliche.  But let me put it this way- my whole life, I've been raised on a steady diet of ""You'll never, you can't, you aren't,"" and ""you won't.""  2009 will be the year that I say Screw That.  (See also:  assertiveness and confidence).  This will be the year that I respond ""I will, I can, I am"", and hopefully, ""I have.""  

Take a new perspective on Fate and Luck.  I still believe in what I refer to loosely as ""Fate"", or the general sense that if the Universe has a plan, one way or another it'll come to fruition.  But to borrow a line from Harvey Dent, ""You make your own luck.""  There's something to be said for being in the right place at the right time, but in any kind of ""odds"" situation, chances are there's something that can be done to tip them in your favor.  ""Resigning yourself to fate"" is the same thing as making a choice through inaction.

Make some financial compromises.  I still have the money I set aside for moving in with Lauren, and I'm keeping that isolated for when I need to move next.  The money I'm making from my current job will pay off the end of my student loans.  I don't need to do that necessarily, since I've paid ahead and my next payment is due January 2011.  But if I don't do that, I'll spend the money on a motorcycle this year.  After considering that, I don't really need the bike I really want as a first bike, especially since first bikes more often than not get dropped, and replacing the plastics on a smaller, cheaper bike is, well, cheaper.  I can both pay off my loans, get a mid-range bike (a 500 as opposed to the 650r I really want), use that for a season, and then upgrade next year.  Insurance on a smaller bike is less money too, and if I need to take out a loan for a degree program, having paid off my previous loan will help with the interest rate.

And finally, one that might surprise you.  A resolution to spend less time in front of a computer.  That might seem odd considering I'll hopefully be working a computer job and studying for computer exams, but what I'm referring to is all the time wasted sitting at my desk browsing the web for lack of anything else to do.  Sure, there's all kinds of whimsical and entertaining content on the internet, but at the end of the day it isn't any better than staring at the TV for hours on end.  I actually have an experiment planned, but I'm not going to write about it until it is over.</lj-cut>"

"event","If I'm ever going to get through a day without feeling sad, angry, lonely, frustrated, or some combination of any of all of the above, I need to start by changing the music in my car.  The CD's I've had on repeat are not good ones to have in right now.  Actually, I take that back.  For the purposes of singing/screaming along and venting massive amounts of angst, they're fantastic albums.  Currently in my 6-CD changer:

Toadies- Rubberneck
(Standout Tracks:  Mr. Love, Quitter, Possum Kingdom)

Local H- Ham Fisted
(Standout Tracks:  Cynic, Mayonnaise and Malaise, User, Manipulator)

Nine Inch Nails- With Teeth
(Standout Tracks:  All the Love in the World, Every Day is Exactly the Same, Right Where it Belongs)

Local H- Pack up the Cats
(Standout Tracks:  ""Cha! Said the Kitty"", Fine and Good, What Can I Tell You?)

Sugarcult- Palm Trees and Power Lines
(Standout Tracks: Memory, Worst December, Head Up)

Cake- homemade compilation
(Standout Tracks:  Sheep Go to Heaven, Friend is a Four Letter Word, Italian Leather Sofa)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, really good albums.  ""Pack Up the Cats"" and ""Palm Trees and Power Lines"" are without a doubt two of the most frequently played albums (of mine) of 2008.  Without exception, each album has a heavy focus on relationships, mostly ones that ended.  They display a wide range of emotions regarding that subject, from Nine Inch Nails' seething anger and self-doubt to Sugarcult's lamenting and reflection, to Cake's signature blend of humorous, cheeky, and bluntly honest, with a double dose of Local H, featuring blind rage and pain on Ham Fisted and defiant recovery on Pack Up the Cats.

It's been about a month since whatever actually happened between Lauren and I, happened.  And in that past month, although I've been vocal here, I haven't really had anyone to talk to.  So like I usually do, I used my music as something to relate to.  For the past month, those albums (and a few others currently out of rotation) have been comforting, cathartic, and a great release.  Most of you who know me in real life probably know me as a generally quiet person.  You'd be downright terrified if you saw/heard me literally screaming along with Local H's ""Manipulator""  (http://www.last.fm/music/Local+H/_/Manipulator) while driving home on the thruway at night.

It's not a secret that I've been in an incredible amount of emotional pain.  But it's gradually sinking in that focusing on that is not going to make it go away.  Tonight I'm going to burn a new set of six CD's, and wipe the musical slate clean.  It might take some adjustments before I get another good set that I can leave in rotation, but I'll update when I figure out the first lineup."

"event","Here's a crazy idea.  What if, instead of going on the Big Hike, I went on a Big Ride instead?

I've been wanting a bike for years and years, and it's something I've been hoping to actually get this coming season.  If I go on the Hike, I'd be selling the bike to pay for most of the expenses.  But if I keep the bike, the expenses would be about the same PLUS I'd still have a bike.  Going on a ride has the benefit of taking less time, too.  Which means it might be possible to convince someone to come along with me.  Here's what I figure:

New York, NY to San Francisco is roughly 2900 miles.  At 200 miles a day, that could be done in a little over two weeks.  I'd probably allot a bit more time, more likely an entire month.  That way I'd have time for ""0 mile days"" (to borrow a through-hiker term), or weather/sightseeing/sick/lazy days.  Or, time to go back home, if I wanted to ride back.

Most bikes get between 30 and 60 miles per gallon.  A 3000 mile trip at 30MPG would cost $300, at $3.00/gallon.  Considering airfare from NY to CA is about the same, that's not too bad.  Chances are, I'd be getting better mileage than that.  A full 6000 mile round trip would only be $600, still not bad.

Food and lodging might be a bit more expensive.  Meals at most commercial establishments run around $8 for something basic.  Packing ""trail gear"" like instant coffee and granola/GORP would save some money there.  Staying at a campsite runs around $20, and motels can be found for less than $80 a night in most places.  Actually, a quick search shows that the Super8 near where I live would be $85 for a single bed, $110 for a double bed room.  If I traveled with someone, that'd cut down costs to ~$55 for lodging on non-camping nights.  If I went alone, and camped half of the time, that'd be around $1650 for lodging expenses, and approximately $750 for three $8 meals per day (if the trip took a month).  Food costs could very likely be much less, or more depending on where I stop.

Gear would be by far the most costly part of the trip.  Depending on what kind of bike I got, it could run anywhere from $3000-$5000.  I don't think I'd spend much more than $5k on the bike itself, and even that would be pushing it.  It'd be at least another thousand for the helmet, gloves, jacket, pants.  I'd also need a tent, rain cover, and travel/camping supplies.  If I was going to take this trip, I'd probably also purchase a laptop or netbook to take with me, to keep a journal or log of the adventure.  Not an essential, but if added that'd be at least another $400.

So for a two week trip, $300 in gas, ~$800 in lodging, ~$400 for food, plus bike and gear.
For a month, $600 in gas, ~$1600 in lodging, and $800 for food.  

Three grand blown in a month.  Seems like a lot, but it'd be a lot of adventure packed into a short amount of time.  By comparison, I'd probably need to spend the same amount (before gear and airfare and such) doing the hike.  All things considered, the hike would probably be cheaper in the end, but take six times as long.  I could do the ride by myself, whereas I'd be hesitant to do the hike alone.  I'd rather have company either way though.

Something for me to think about.  The ride wouldn't be until 2010 anyway, so I could get in at least one full season of riding."

"event","I tried to sleep, had a dream that I was a cloud.  Yeah, I know, it didn't make sense to me either.  I was a fluffy white cloud, but there was no wind.  I gradually became a dark storm cloud but couldn't rain, even though I wanted to.  I blocked out most of the sunlight.  Someone was driving a car along what appeared to be a desert highway.  I woke up.

Kind of an odd dream to be such a non-anthropomorphic object.  I'm sure it's all very symbolic, but I'm too tired to properly analyze it.  Thought I'd write it down while I still remember.

"event","I didn't write about it at the time, but about ten days ago I spoke with Lauren on the phone.  She was upset about something (completely unrelated to me), and I called to make sure she was ok, fully expecting to get her voice mail as it was the middle of the day.  She picked up, and we talked for almost an hour.  Not about anything really interesting or important, mostly small talk.

She called me back tonight to let me know that everything was ok (regarding the above issue).  More small talk followed.  She's starting to move this week, and she's getting furniture for her apartment.  As much as it makes me feel better to hear her voice, the way we talk leaves me feeling sad.

It's like she's pretending that there's nothing wrong, or maybe she's just insensitive to the fact that I might hold more than a passing interest in what she's thinking.  That's one of the big reasons this has been so hard for me- I know now that she reads this, and I think I've been pretty clear about what I've been thinking and how I've been feeling.  On the other end of the spectrum, I'm more or less entirely cut off from her.  I have no idea what's going on in her head most of the time, and I wish I did.  Does she miss me?  Does she care at all?  Does she want things to work out in the end, or does she just want me to go away?  I don't know, and I don't know if she'll ever tell me.  I can't confront her and ask, either.  I know she hasn't yet had the time she needs to figure things out, and I'm trying really hard not to push her.  At the same time, all I want is to hear that I'm not wasting my time by thinking that someday we can be happy together again.  I know she'll tell me one way or another when she's ready, but until then it feels like slow, painful, indifferent torture.

And that's why I'm up at a quarter to four in the morning, unable to sleep.

I'm not going to censor myself.  I WANT her to know what I'm thinking.  I'd rather tell her directly, but I don't think she's ready to have that conversation.  She was always the one person I could be completely open and honest to, even more than my closest friends from home or Ithaca.  When we were together, it seemed like that was the case for her as well.  Being shut out feels like someone twisting the knife.  It hurts.

I'm getting better at dealing with it, but that doesn't mean it's getting easier."

"event","The more I play with OS X the more I like it.  I really think that if Apple dropped the smarmy marketing campaign (and a bit of the price) they'd win over a few die-hard PC users.  If I wasn't into computer gaming, I could probably use OS X as my primary operating system.  One thing I found really neat is how applications are installed and uninstalled.

<lj-cut text=""If you're not into computers, this will almost certainly be boring to read..."">

Installing a program typically consists of downloading a file with a .dmg extension.  These files act like virtual disk images (for PC users, think .ISO files for virtual CD images).  Executing the .dmg file ""mounts"" it, so you can browse the files on the disk.  Most prepackaged apps pop up a window displaying the icon of the application, and a shortcut to the Applications folder on your hard drive.  Installing the program is as easy as dragging the icon into the Application folder.  Unlike Windows apps, most OS X apps have just the one file, so you don't have to worry about all sorts of file libraries or messy folder structures.  Uninstalling the program is as simple as deleting the file from the Applications folder.

This works because the ""program"", generally ending in .app, is actually a package, not just a single executable.  The package contains several component files, such as preferences, color palettes, logs, and things like that.  The components can often be modified manually for fine tuning, but I've not yet come across a scenario where that was necessary for the app to function.

There are some programs that have a .mpkg file, rather than a .dmg or .app file.  These, I'm guessing, are similar to *nix programs that need to be compiled (if I had to guess, I'd say mpkg = make package).  They tend to have actual installer wizards, more like typical Windows applications.  It appears that they install their resources into specific resource folders, and drop the .app file for the program itself in Applications.  That's a good way to do things- it keeps the Applications folder clean, and keeps all of the resources in a central location.

I've been pretty impressed with this operating system so far.  The price of a new Apple computer is still a negative point however.  To illustrate:  I built my current PC in January 08 for approximately $1600, including the monitor (24"" Dell, full price.. yeah, not so cheap).  I got my (legit) copy of Vista for free from Microsoft, but that would have been around another $3-400 (it came with both 32 and 64-bit Vista Ultimate).  It has a Q6600 core 2 quad processor running at 3.6GHz, 4GB RAM, and an ASUS 8800GTS 512 G92 video card.  The best iMac you can get right now has:

# 3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
# 2GB 800MHz DDR2 SDRAM - 2x1GB
# NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS w/512MB GDDR3

and STARTS at $2200.  The RAM is the only piece you can even upgrade, and that runs $150 for another 2GB.  But it all depends on what you want to do with it.  For about $1000 less, you can get a 20"" iMac with lower specs and anunimpressive graphics processor, but that'd make a perfectly good computer for a family that doesn't play intensive games or edit video.  You could argue that for half the price of that, you could build a Windows computer or even a linux one, but I can see how people might be drawn to the shiny Apple interface and the ""it just works"" policy.  That's another argument I hear frequently both for and against Apple- you can't really modify or upgrade the hardware.  That's true, what you get it what you're stuck with until you upgrade.  On the other hand, having an extremely low number of components to support means that Apple can focus on making sure that they always work, and that anything that's supposed to work on an Apple, does.  Windows is pretty picky as far as the drivers it'll cooperate with, although you can generally get most things to work.  And don't get me started on linux and hardware.  I guess that's why Apple is marketed towards a more affluent crowd- when your hardware becomes obsolete, you just replace it.  </lj-cut>The car metaphor works well here:

Linux is a kit car.  You can get the components for a song, but you'll put in months worth of man-hours before it runs the way you want.  If you know how to build it, you can end up with a dream machine.

Windows is a tuner car.  You start with a fairly standard setup (say, a Subaru Impreza) and have lots of options to replace parts or tweak things.  It's fun to put together and rewarding to fix, when it works.  But it's also frustratingly easy to break things, and difficult to get the entire system to work in concert.  For a bit more than the base price you can blow away people with much more expensive systems, if you don't blow the engine first.

Apple is a luxury car.  It's shiny, has a slick interface, and generally does what you want it to right out of the box.  Replacing any of the major components voids the warranty, but for the price you paid, you wouldn't really want to anyway.  When you realize that the Jones' computer next door is sleeker and faster, you can just get the new model.  Maybe Apple should lease computers.  Hmm."

Work has been, well, work.  I've been doing a lot of lifting and moving of heavy objects, and not so much on the technical side.  The other temp flaked out on both Monday and Tuesday, the really important post-move days.  My employers were pretty pissed about that, and to be honest I wasn't thrilled to be lugging around twice as much stuff either.  But what can you do.  Now they want me to work Monday, Tuesday, and Friday of next week, and ""probably up until around January 9th"".  It's been nearly impossible to get a straight answer or a consistent story from the guy in charge, so as of now it's anyone's guess how long this contract will last.  Kind of puts me in a tight spot, since I can't accept new ones until this is over.

Regarding Lauren's Christmas gift:  it was a glass rose with a blue bud.  Similar to the ones I've given her every year since I started going to her house for Christmas, but a bit different.  The artist that made the ones I've been giving her stopped making them this year, so I had to find a different one.  The previous ones had an open flower with gold accents on the leaves, whereas this one had a closed bud.  It's a complete coincidence, but I found it to be somewhat of a metaphor for our relationship.  The blue rose has been symbolic of our relationship since started dating- the first year we were dating I gave her a full-sized fake rose with blue petals, and every year after that I gave her the glass ones.  The year that we're not together, they stopped making the rose I wanted to give her, and the only one I could find had a closed bud.  

The extended metaphor continues.  As my sister pointed out, most flowers don't close their buds when they die, they just wilt and the petals fall off.  A closed flower can bloom.  Lauren has expressed that there is a chance, whatever the odds, that in the future we might be able to figure things out.  It's like the universe is in on some great cosmic joke, but doesn't want to reveal the punchline just yet.

I haven't heard from her since yesterday morning when I wished her a Merry Christmas, and she wished me a Happy December 25th.  I know Christmas at the Oakleys is always extreme craziness, and she may be working today.  But even just a simple ""thank you"" would have made my day.  Oh well.

In unrelated news, I got to see a friend of mine who I sort of lost touch with after graduating high school recently.  He was staying with Brandon, and going off to visit some other people this weekend.  It was a good time, the three of us used to hang out a lot and it didn't take long for us to fall back into the rhythm of conversations and wisecracks that we used to have.  We played some Rockband, saw a movie, and had Chinese food for dinner.  It wasn't quite the same as spending time with Lauren and her family on Christmas, but at least we fulfilled the Jewish stereotype for the day.

Not much else to write for now.  No plans for New Years, and not even the slightest clue as to what next year will bring.  Like I've said countless times before, if you're at all interested in where life takes me, this is the place to hear about it."

Today for lunch I went over to the food court at the Westchester Mall, which happens to be literally around the corner from the office building I'm working in (the NY one, anyway).  While eating I was doing a bit of people watching and taking in the holiday decorations.  One of the food places was called ""Baby Yogurt!"", which in itself sounds like a euphemism for vomit, or worse.  Baby Yogurt had a big colorful Christmas sign hanging below its main neon sign, and it was hanging directly in front of the words ""IT'S FROZEN YOGURT"".  From where I was sitting, it looked like the signs read ""Baby Yogurt!  It's F    N YOGURT!""  I found that amusing- ""It's effin' yogurt!"" would be a great marketing catch-phrase.

2)
After lunch I decided to head down to the Apple store.  The first thing I noticed (aside from the bright white.. everything) was the solid mass of people writhing around in the store.  There were two models/bouncers at the front door (seriously, one girl and one guy standing around in Apple uniforms looking like they should be standing in front of an Abercrombie or NYC lounge).  I forged ahead, entering the store not to browse for hardware but to inquire about study materials for the ACSP exam (see previous post).  

I saw in the very back of the store two bookshelves, one with boxes of software and one with books.  As I was looking through the books, a very ""Hi, I'm a Mac"" looking dude came up and asked if I needed any help.  I told him, ""Sure, I'm trying to find a study guide for the ACSP.""  He looked at me like I was speaking Swahili, and responded, ""We have software for the SAT and PSAT.""  After recovering from the ""ow, that hurt my brain"" moment, I said, ""No, I'm looking for a physical book that I can use to study for the Apple Certified Support Professional exam.""  His reaction- ""Oh, I don't think anyone out on the floor here has that.  We don't usually recommend that to our customers.  Maybe one of the service techs in the back can help you?""  At that point it occurred to me that this was sort of like walking into a Best Buy and asking around at the Geek Squad counter for a book on the A+ exam.  I thanked him for his time and squeezed my way out of the store, trying not to smirk too obviously.

3)
Work itself was pretty uneventful today, mostly because there really weren't any events that happened.  I got in on time despite nasty ice/snow weather, blanked out the last few hard drives that are getting recycled, and headed upstairs to check my email and such while they were running.  At that point I found out that the internet connection for the entire office building was down.  So I went to the guy I'm working for and asked if there was anything else I could do since I had finished my previous task.  Apparently there wasn't.  His response- ""I'll be working on this internet problem for a while, why don't you go check your email... or.. something, and I'll come find you when there's something to do.""

Since the internet was dead and I had nothing better to be doing, I fired up the music player on my phone and basically poked at everything that wasn't locked down on my Mac Mini.  OS X is actually pretty cool- it's roughly Unix based, so it has some similarities to the Linux distro's I've be playing with, and I find that all to be interesting stuff.  Unfortunately, with no internet and a very limited set of applications, once I had been through all of the programs available to me and tweaked all of the settings, I was bored again with hours to kill still.  So I started a game of Chess.  About three games in, the guy who sits in the cube next to me (technically, I sit at a desk that is up against the outside wall of his cube.. I'm open to the hallway) pops his head over the barrier and whispers ""You might not want to do that.""  ""Do what?""  ""Play games on there.  It's kind of against company policy.""

At that exact moment the boss of my boss's boss (Manager < Senior Manager < Old Guy Everyone Seems to be Afraid Of) happened to be walking by and overheard what he was saying.  ""Playing games, are we son?""  ""Yes sir, I'm between tasks so I was playing a game of chess.""  At that point his expression changed.  ""Chess isn't a game, it's a strategy simulation.  Go see if (my boss) has anything for you to do yet, if not you have my permission to continue using this program.  I'd much rather see my employees do that on their free time than mess around with the mindless nonsense on that My Face Whatever Site.""  I'm not sure if he knew that the internet was down, which is why I wasn't on Facebook at that moment, but I thanked him and did a lap around the cubicle farm before finishing my game.
--------------------------------------------------------

The next several days should be interesting.  It sounds like tomorrow will be more packaging stuff, Friday is the move itself, Saturday and Sunday will be unpacking, setting up, and testing, and Monday/Tuesday will be ""live support"" for lack of a better term.  From Wednesday until January 5th the entire company has a break, which explains why I was told I wouldn't be needed during that time.  I don't have any plans for the holidays or New Years, so if nothing else that'll be a week or so to study for the A+.  I'd really like to have the A+ and ACSP done before the Net+ comes out, but I guess we'll see how it goes."

The Apple Certified Support Professional exam is more or less the equivalent of the A+ for everyone's favorite slick white Unix variant.  I'm hoping that I can get that completed by the end of March, which would give the Network+ books and study materials time to come out.  It'd give me a fairly unique edge- not many people have that certification in general, and probably less have that and several other PC-based ones.  I know I haven't even finished the A+ yet, but it's something for me to chew on in the meantime."

I suppose I have to take that with a grain of salt- it could just as easily be true or not.  I'm inclined to believe it though.  She's been overworking herself since way before the breakup, to an extent that's not entirely healthy.  But she's always been pushed by her parents to be an overachiever at the expense of her own happiness.  I'm sure that factors significantly into all of this.

Anyway, it made me feel at least a little better to hear something from her.  Even if it was an afterthought, she wanted to let me know she didn't just blow me off because she wasn't interested in talking.  I guess that's something."

It's possible that she's working late, or that ""something came up.""  It's also possible that she decided that in addition to phone calls, talking online ""is not a good idea"" either.

I'm not upset, I'm just disappointed.  It's not like her to say she'll be somewhere, or do something, and simply disappear.  If she really just wants nothing to do with me, I'd hope she'd be respectful enough, or know that I would be respectful enough, to leave her alone if she simply asked.  

I don't know what else to say about that.  It just seems like ever since the actual breakup, she's forgotten that I'm a person.

On a completely unrelated note, Brandon finally reached the end of a long-running saga relating to his relationship with his ex-fiance.  I won't post the specifics here- it's not my business too and I don't think he'd appreciate it.  At least he gets some closure, even if it is very nearly the worst case scenario.

Everyone keeps telling me that I should take this time to ""for myself"" and to ""do what makes me happy"".  All I have right now is myself, and there isn't much that makes me happy lately.  I'm working, for now, and I'm working on my certifications.  I wouldn't say studying for the certs makes me happy, but it'll certainly help with the working part.

I just can't shake that feeling I described in my earlier post.  If this isn't going to work out, I'd rather know now.  I know that Lauren is taking this time ""for herself"", but meanwhile I'm stuck in limbo.  I can't move on because there's still the chance that I won't have to, but I can't affect the decision in any way either.  It isn't fair to me, but I don't think that was ever taken into consideration."

It feels like she's using the internet as an emotional barrier- I suppose it's easier to hide what you're feeling when neither party can see or hear the other.

That means even if we do end up patching things up, best case scenario is another year of doing the long distance thing.  Or, me somehow getting a job and an apartment near her and taking the gamble that it'll work this time around.

I've been pretty depressed since I found out.  I'd love to hear that there's something I'm missing or haven't thought of, especially directly from her.  I really do want it to work, more than anything.  I'm just having a hard time envisioning how it could, given the recent turn of events.

Last night I went out with Chuck and some other people to have a ""real"" birthday celebration.  We went to a crazy indoor electric go-kart place, that was way too expensive.  So we left, and ended up partying at his house.  There, I learned two things:

1) Spending time with friends is good
2) Intoxication + depression is NOT where I need to be right now

I've been depressed enough times before to know that's what's going on.  It feels a bit as if the atmospheric pressure of the entire world has doubled and someone is telekenetically squeezing my chest.  It's extremely difficult to break out of the fog and think coherently.  If anyone reading this has ever had a bad trip where you got stuck in a negative thought process loop, picture that, minus the drugs.

I need to talk to Lauren and get her perspective on this.  If there's hope, I need to know.  If there isn't, I need to know that too.  It'll be miserable is there isn't, but I don't think I'd survive waiting for the next however many months only to have my heart broken twice.

"event","I spoke with Lauren tonight.  Actually, she contacted me.  Granted it was over the internet, but I'll take what I can get.

I'm glad we got to talk.  It was actually a fairly long conversation.  I think we both got to get a lot off of our chests, and we both really needed to.  I did get more information on her motivation for recent actions.  Turns out it's mostly my fault, and I don't mean that sarcastically.  Part of it was also being overwhelmed with work and life in general, and it doesn't sound like that part has changed much.  

But I found out that this has been difficult for her too, and that she's been wanting to contact me as much as I have her.  More importantly, she still loves me, and this isn't necessarily a permanent thing.  The short version is that general unhappiness with aspects of our relationship combined with high stress and being spread too thin caused her to want to step back for a bit and let everything clear up for a while.  And I can fully appreciate that.  Granted, starting our last conversation with ""I think it's time for this relationship to be over"" didn't quite convey that, but that's not important.

Other parts of the conversation were kind of surreal.  Like the part where we discussed how various friends reacted to the news.  Or talking about our jobs, almost as if nothing had ever happened.

Here's the bit that stood out for me.  She told me that when multiple people asked her (in her words) ""if there was any hope for us, the answer was an overwhelming YES.""  We may have hit a low point, but that doesn't make it a point of no return.  I know there's always the chance that this is false hope, but for now I'll take that over no hope at all."

"event","A+ is still first on the list.  Network+ is getting refreshed for 2009, apparently in March.  I know this because a quick search on Borders/Amazon/Barnes and Noble shows a bunch of training materials with a release date of March 2.  While I would have liked to have gotten started earlier, that gives me a bit more time to get the A+ done.  I think I'm still going to get started on that ASAP- if this contract with Blue Sky ends Christmas week like I think it might, that'd be a great time to sit and study.  That way there's a chance I can get the certification before another job comes up, opening more options.  

The Security+ exam is also getting a refresh in 2009, but I may or may not get to that one until later in the year.  So here goes, in the interest of having something to work towards:

A+ certification goal date  - no later than 2/28/09
Network+ goal date - no later than 5/31/09
(test availability date may affect this)

From there I'm having a hard time deciding what order to go in.  According to this sheet (A href=""http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ck47/cert-equiv-table.pdf"">http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ck47/cert-equiv-table.pdf</a>) the order would be A+, Net+, Server+, MCP 290 (server II), 270, 291 (OS architecture).  I suppose if I gave myself a three month time period to learn the material for each test, I could have the Server+ done by the end of August and the MCP 290 by the end of November.  I wouldn't have my MCSA by the end of the year, but I could have it before I leave for the Big Hike, maybe.  Or I could even stop at that point before the hike, since I'd only be able to apply up to the first MCP exam towards the degree.  I could take the opposite approach once I start classes- take the classes for the degree, then take the equivalent certification. 

Dunno, no point in rambling much longer about all that until things actually get in motion."

"event","Last night I drove out to Monroe to hang out with Chuck on his birthday.  I'm glad we got to hang out, I haven't really seen a lot of him since I've been home.  We had a few drinks, laughed about old times, joked about getting older.  Inevitably the conversation turned to my recent breakup.

It's interesting to get different perspectives on the same issue.  There's Brandon, who somewhat recently went through an extensive and messy breakup with his ex-fiance, ending in him getting a felony charge.  He always used to tell me that I was the one person in our group of friends with a normal, stable relationship.  He's just as surprised as I am by what happened, but writes it off as an example of ""all women being crazy"".  (To anyone of the aforementioned gender please don't take offense, I'm just quoting.)

Then there's Chuck, who has been dating a girl for I believe around two years and has a pretty good relationship with her.  When he heard the news about Lauren and me, he told his girlfriend to be prepared for the fact that nothing lasts forever.  He told her that ""no matter how much you want things to work out, and no matter how much it looks like it will, there's always that chance that it won't.""  On the surface that sounds like raw pessimism, but considering how blindsided I was by Lauren's actions it falls more closely under realism.  I guess we both share a perspective that balances somewhere between Zen and Murphy's Law- ""If anything can go wrong, it will, but the Universe has a way of working itself out.""

And then there's Jesse.  He's never been one for long-term relationships, and isn't quite ready to ""settle down"".  I had a conversation with him a few nights ago via text message, which went something like this:

J: Woah, you and Lauren broke up?
B: Yeah, just before Thanksgiving.  Wasn't really my idea.
J: That's great!  Now you can hang out with me in NYC!
B: ...""that's great"" wasn't exactly the reaction I had at the time.  :P

He used to tell me when I was first dating Lauren that we should break up.  Mostly because his reaction to trouble in relationships is to cut it off, whereas mine is to try harder to make it work.  I thought Lauren operated the same way, but apparently her reaction to something bothering her is to run away without trying at all.  

It's funny, both my friends from Ithaca and from MRC used to ""joke"" around that they were placing bets on when we were going to get engaged.  I never told Lauren this, but I always responded ""give me about a year after we move in together.""  The irony was that they weren't joking about placing bets, and I wasn't joking about the answer.  Lauren, if you're reading this, that's God's honest truth.  A few days ago Jeff called to tell me he had to refund everyone's bets because ""Lauren threw the game.""  Dark humor, I know, but that's just Jeff.

On another note, I'm still working on that whole ""trying to figure out what the heck to do with my life"" now that my goal of moving to Philly with Lauren and going back to school has vaporized.  In the short to intermediate term, I'm going to work on my certifications and save up some money.  It occurred to me recently that I'll need around $3-5k to do the Big Hike, and a Ninja 500 costs around $3k.  I could potentially get the bike in the spring, sell it in the fall/winter for about what I spent, and have the money I'd need to do the hike AND have a bike for a season.  Yes, I'd have about another grand in riding gear that I wouldn't get back, but most of that stuff can be saved for the year after the hike if I should want to/be able to get a bike again.   Just an idea I had to accomplish two things with one investment.  

For more immediate goals:  I want to be A+ certified by the end of February.  I'd also like to be MCSE certified by Q3 of next year, but I'm not sure how long that takes since it's several different tests.  If I can knock those out, and maybe throw in the Network+ and/or Apple ACSE certification by the end of the year, I'll be in pretty good shape to get a job when I get back from the hike.  At least in better shape than I was when I left CBORD.  While the hike itself may not help with getting a job (though it might), it's a major goal and something to work towards.  That's really what I need right now- some kind of guidance or direction.  I like having options and I'm always open to new ideas, but I can't move forward unless I pick a path to start on.  For now, that path is everything I was planning on doing if I had still been with Lauren at this point, only without her.

Edit: I had to rush to finish this, and it occurred to me that I didn't finish my thought before.  The reason I mentioned the certifications was also in part because I can use them towards the online degree I want to pursue as well.  I believe the A+ counts for 6 credits (since it is really two tests and waives two courses) and the MSCE has got to be at least another 3 credits, probably more.  

Here's what I've learned so far:
The MSCA is a step below the MCSE.  The difference is another exam or two.  The A+ and either Network+ or Server+ exams count as an elective exam for the MCSA, but not the MCSE.  The Security+ exam counts towards the MSCE.  So I'm thinking I could go for A+, Network+, Server+, then MCSA, then Security+, then MSCE.  That's a lot of exams to take, even over the course of an entire year.  But the A+ should only take a month or two, Network+ shouldn't take much longer, and at that point I'll already be better equipped than I am now.   I think ultimately a reasonable goal to set would be to get my MCSA by the end of next year.  If it turns out I have more time, great.  If I have that before leaving for the Big Hike I should be all set to start the online degree when I get home."

Since I've been promising to write about work, here's the short version:

The company is the animation studio responsible for the Ice Age movies (along with Robots and Horton Hears a Who).  I'm helping them prepare to move from White Plains, NY to a new office in CT not far from here.  So far, I've assembled and programmed almost 50 network switches (dual 10 Gigabit optical connections and Power over Ethernet capable), imaged 50 Sun Ultra 24 Linux workstations, and have been providing support for 180 windows, OS X, and various linux workstations.  The official move is on Dec. 19th.  That's a Friday, and I believe they want me to work the weekend too since we're tight on time.  I don't know what their plan is for working during Christmas week, but it doesn't matter much to me since for the first time in several years I won't be going to Jersey for the holidays.  On the plus side Chad is coming home, so I'm going to try to get Chuck and Brandon, and maybe even Jesse to come hang out somewhere when he's around.  Like I've always said, my friends are my real family, and you're supposed to spend time with the family during the holidays, right?

What else to write about work.  Oh yeah, I don't know where it went but all of the stop and go traffic that makes my commute three times longer than it should be disappeared today.  I got from Montebello Rock City to White Plains in just over 30 minutes.  I didn't even have to slow down until the Cross Westchester Expressway, around exit 5.  If the traffic was like that every day, I'd be very happy.

Currently I'm waiting on someone here at BSS to fix a computer image so I can get back to work on those Sun stations.  I've been playing with a bunch of cool Linux stuff at this job, including some crazy 8-core 8GB RAM Fedora rendering stations and a really slick workstation running Maya (animation software) on Red Hat.

Hmm.  This coffee is kicking in and I'm drawing a blank on what else to write about.   Guess that's it for now, I'm going to go find something to do."

"event","I woke up in a good mood today.  I don't know why, I can't explain it.  I got about five and a half hours of sleep, but jumped out of bed when the alarm went off and made myself some breakfast.  I cranked the stereo on the way to work (which I promise I will eventually write about) and rocked out to two good albums.  That's a plus side to having an hour and a half commute each way- time for plenty of music while navigating stop-and-go traffic.  At some point during the commute a random thought popped into my head- ""I think I'm going to be OK.""

I think this morning was a critical turning point, emotionally anyway.  It might just be that overnight my subconscious mind finally worked out that my relationship with Lauren is over, and despite her saying that it might be possible to resume it ""in the future"", I think we both know that's not likely.  Clearly she had reasons for making that choice, whether or not she was willing or able to express them.  And if she was that convinced that there was no way to make the relationship work and no point in trying, well, that sounds like a sell-fulfilling prophecy to me.  And it wouldn't have benefited either of us if we had tried to force it.  

So yes, it still sucks that I lost a lover and quite possibly my closest friend.  And yes, I still get lonely during my commute when I would normally call her to talk about nothing in particular.  But these recent events don't mean that life has to come screeching to a halt.  I deserve better than someone who will throw away my love on a whim, and there's a good chance I can find it if I give it time.  Who knows, maybe at some point down the road our paths will cross and we'll both realize that the other was the best thing we ever had.  Or maybe not.  I'll just have to let fate run its course.

Maybe my subconscious mind figured that all out while I was snoring like a lumberjack, or maybe I'm just having a manic day.  Whatever the case is, I woke up feeling like a metric ton of weight was lifted off of my chest, and I'm going to run with that feeling as long as it lasts."

"event","Last night I went into NYC to hang out with Brandon and celebrate getting a job.  The trip into the city was a bit long, but I made it in one piece.  We ended up going to Conways, the same place we went last time I saw him in the city.  It was an interesting night.  A while after we'd been sitting at the bar, a woman I'd never met before came up to me and said ""You're not going to start crying in your beer, are you?""  I told her I was sorry, I didn't realize I was that obvious.  She said ""I'd know that look anywhere.  Recent breakup?  Don't worry, you're better off.  I'm 31 and happily single.""  I know it was meant to cheer me up (and no, it wasn't a come-on) but it really had the opposite effect.

Then there was the couple who, from what I could deduce, decided not to pay for their round of drinks and then started harassing the bartender.  The guy was a real sleazeball, and eventually said something to the effect of ""I have a PhD!  I'm a marine!  I'll kick your ass!"".  That made me wonder 1)what does having a PhD have to do with kicking someone's ass? And 2) Did he seriously expect anyone to believe either of those things?  With long slicked back hair and a goatee he might have been an ex-marine at best, but I highly doubt it.  He was pretty insistent on fighting the bartender, who kept his cool and asked them to leave.  At the same time, several people in the bar were offering to go outside and settle the dispute in his place.

The whole night reminded me of Micawbers, and not in a good way.  Whenever I'd go to Micawbers I would usually step outside for a while and call Lauren.  Last night was the kind of night where I would have called her to tell her about the funny stuff I saw on the train, or about the obnoxious couple in the bar, or called just to talk about nothing.  I had to catch myself at least once when I started reaching for the phone.  It just sucks.  I feel like something is missing from my day.  And beyond that, I have no one to share these experiences with the way we did.  I almost wish I could have just that part of the relationship back, but at the same time that might be more painful than not talking at all."

"event","Tonight I broke the news to my parents.  It went about as expected.  They were much more interested in the details about the job than about the other half.  They didn't really give me a hard time, but I'm glad I waited until after Thanksgiving to bring it up.  They're ok with me sticking around until I can find a place to move into, which is also nice.

One of the positive aspects of this turn of events is that I'll have a bit more money this holiday season than I thought I would.  Since I still have all of the money put aside for moving into my own place, I think I'm going to do two things with the money I make at this job next month.  First, finally pay off my student loans.  I don't have much left, a few grand, and I'll be able to get rid of that by the end of the year.  

Second, I think I might get one of the new Dell Mini Inspiron 9's.  It's essentially a tiny laptop that's good for light application using and web browsing, and some multimedia.  For the geeks reading this, the Mini 9 is Dell's answer to the EEE PC netbook.  For the non-geeks, picture a laptop about the size and weight of a good paperback book that's only slightly less powerful than your desktop computer.  I'd like to get it because from what I hear, it's a trivial matter to install the Apple OS X on it.  Since my new job is going to involve a fair amount of Apple tech support, it wouldn't hurt to familiarize myself with the OS.  I've also been knocking around the idea of going for the ACSP certification after I get my A+.  The ACSP is the Apple Computer Support Professional certification.

We'll see what really ends up happening.  The full A+ (essentials and specific exams) counts for two courses or six credits towards the Drexel online degree, and the MCP counts for another course.  The ACSP doesn't count at all, but looks good and would definitely help in the job hunt.  Since the Drexel degree works on a quarterly system, two courses per quarter, if I complete the A+ and MCP by the end of next summer I'll be pretty close to on track.  Even if I end up going on the Big Hike in 2010 and wait until the following Fall to start classes, I'll be in pretty good shape.

I don't mean to count my chickens before they hatch, but I did want to get a new idea out ""on paper"" while it was still fresh.  And on that note, I'm off to NYC."

Whenever something interesting or exciting happened, she was the first person I called.  Today when I found out that I actually had the job in White Plains, my first reaction after I hung up with the headhunter was to call her and let her know.  Then it dawned on me that I wouldn't be taking that job if we were still together, I would have taken the one in Yardley, PA or one in Wilmington.  It just made me sad.  Yes, I lost a lover but I also lost a friend.  I know I have to move on because this wasn't my choice and there's nothing I can do about it, but at the same time I keep hoping she'll wake up one of these days and realize it was all a mistake.

I'm going to take that and run with it- if the guy I've been working with had other plans, I've got her on record saying that I have the position and to be there on Monday.  I'm hoping it was just a miscommunication, since he's been pretty nice so far too.

I figure if I have to, I can head out to the job site on Monday and call him on the road to confirm that I should be there.  If not it'll be a wasted trip, but that's not the worst part.  I was really hoping to leverage the news about not moving in with Lauren against the news of having a job; as I'd mentioned, sensitivity doesn't really run in the family. My parents will be much more interested in hearing about the job.  But if I don't hear anything about the job before Monday, I'll have to explain why I'm getting up at 7am, putting on work clothes, and heading out for a job that's NOT in Philly that I may or may not actually have.

Very Loud doctor cousin screaming profanities and death wishes to her patients
Grandmother asking me five hundred times if I need a drink (alcoholic, and no)
Aunt insisting that cousin should marry a college athlete for the money and have an affair
Me resisting the urge to Facepalm over, and over, and over again

Much of the rest of the night was spent listening to Aunt and other cousin argue over whether or not he should purchase a new TV, and what size.  Fortunately I was able to keep quiet, and didn't have to say much of anything about anything.  That means I get to wait until I hear from the headhunter tomorrow (er, later today?) before breaking the news to my parents.  That conversation will go something like this:

""Hey, you know how I quit my job, moved out of Ithaca, and spent the last six months trying to find a place to move into around Philly?  The bad news is it turns out that was a complete and total waste of time because somewhere along the line Lauren decided that our relationship wasn't worth a damn but forgot to give me a heads up.  I know, it's an easily overlooked detail.  Anyway, the good news is I start work on Monday, and I'll be moving out as soon as possible.""

I'm trying not to be bitter about the whole thing.  It really makes me sad to think I'll recoil at the thought of someone I spent the past six years in love with.  Hopefully it's just a phase I'll pass through if and when I get over it.  And considering this journal is where I let out the most honest things in my head, this is the space to watch to find out."

And since supposedly what I'm supposed to be learning from this breakup is that I should be living for myself and doing what I want, taking control of my appearance is a good place to start.

"event","So my ""phone interview"" this morning for a position in Wilmington was a complete waste of time.  I don't know if I'd mentioned it here (and I'm too tired to bother checking) but I'd gotten an email a few days ago from a company about an entry-level programming position, and was scheduled to have a phone interview about it today.  Without getting into overly technical terms, the job requirements for the position were ""classwork, formal training, or experience with programming languages X,Y,Z"".  During my correspondence with the hiring manager, I told her that I don't have experience in X,Y,or Z, but I do have experience with similar languages A,B,and C, and asked if she thought that would be sufficient for consideration.  Her response was, ""It might be, let's discuss it on Wednesday at 10am.""

The phone call consisted of her reading an obviously scripted description of the position (starting with ""just a second, let me adjust this document on my laptop"") and ended with her asking if I had experience with X,Y, or Z languages.  Now I'd already confirmed that she was the same person I'd been emailing with, but I know it's easy for people to forget minute details (like essential job requirements) so I explained that I didn't, but did with A,B, and C.  Very abruptly she says, ""Oh, well then I don't think we can continue this interview.  I wish you would have mentioned that in our earlier correspondence.""  

At that point I considered reciting any one of a number of proverbs about wishes and the fact that she was wasting my time, but decided to politely thank her for hers and let it go.  It would have been a good job to get into, but it was in Wilmington, DE, and something tells me it's not in my best interest to go there at this point in time.

Now I just need to see what happens with the White Plains job.  I'm going to give that guy a call in a few hours and see if he tracked down my other references."

Being woken up by a headhunted with a job offer
Finding out it's close enough to NYC that I could potentially move to the area and split a place with Brandon
Decent pay rate
Starts Monday

Things that are not:
Finding out that my primary professional reference screwed me by saying that any information regarding my job history had to come from HR
The fact that HR knows about as much about my technical background as cats know about being a dog


I got a call from the headhunter service I've been using about a job in White Plains.  It's for an animation studio that's relocating their office, and needs someone to assist in taking everything apart, migrating, and setting up in the new office, along with desktop and remote support.  The pay is more than enough to work with.  No interview required, since I'm being placed by the headhunter.

The part that pisses me off is that my primary job reference at my previous employer decided to screw me over.  Anyone from that company still reading this will know who I mean when I say HE was my previous manager.  Apparently he told the headhunter, who was following up on my references, that he would only tell them my dates of hire and anything further had to come from HR.  The only thing HR knows is how much more the job was worth compared to what they paid me.

So I called my other two references, a former senior tech and Matt.  Matt was busy, on-site with a client I'm sure.  I got in touch with the other one, and confirmed with him that it was still cool to use him as a reference.  I'm not really worried about Matt, just wanted to give him a heads up that he'll likely be getting a call very soon.

I know there are legal restrictions as far as what you can say as a reference, but I'm fairly certain that it's completely legal to say ""Yes, Brian was responsible for XYZ job functions, ABC operating systems, and QWERTY interfaces.""  It's not legal to comment on the quality of work, or say anything that would influence the hiring decision.  But last time I checked, ""Yes you can use me as a reference"" meant ""Yes you can use me as a reference"".  It's alright though, he's one of the phoniest, least trustworthy people I know.  So it's more disappointing than upsetting to hear that he didn't keep his word.  I'm getting kind of used to people saying one thing doing another.

Guess we'll see how this one plays out."

M: What?  Why?

"event","This has been my place to write and speak my mind for a long time.  If you don't like what's written here, feel free to close the page.

Lauren ended our relationship today.  I phrase it like that, as opposed to ""Lauren and I broke up"", because I had no part in making the decision.  She simply decided that because some things had been difficult, it needed to end.  That was about as much explanation as I got.

She was unwilling to express what it was that caused her to feel that way.  When pressed, she went on to admit that she didn't know.  And she was completely unwilling to try to work things out.

That hurt.  A lot.  We've been dating for over six years, but apparently that's not worth much, because she decided that it wasn't possible to resolve the issues she was having.  Even though she couldn't describe them beyond ""we don't always agree on everything.""

One thing she did say that stood out was her definition of a relationship.  To paraphrase, she said it was ""Two complete people who complement each other.""  Maybe it's because she was raised in an environment where she was taught to believe that an ideal person should be infallible.  Maybe it's because I was raised in an environment where I learned that no person, especially myself, would ever be 100% complete.  But I told her that a relationship was ""two imperfect people who fill each others missing pieces and support each other.""  We'll call it a difference of opinion.

I hope throwing away everything we've worked towards helps her become a complete person.  And I hope she finds her perfect, complete match.  Not because I believe perfection exists, but because I love her.  If the pursuit of this ideal is more important than what we had, by God I hope she finds it.

Because you don't get to hurt me like this and then decide it was a mistake.  You don't get to take away that part of me, the motivating factor for the past six years, and decide you want it back.  When I had to decide whether or not to stay at Ithaca College, I came back to be with you.  When you told me I had to change, I changed for you.  Every single time you got into fights with my friends, I sided with you.  When your aunt said she would intentionally torture your grandmother if I didn't come to the wedding, I went for you.  When you were upset about your professors giving you a hard time I was there for you.  When we graduated and our ""friends"" told me I wasn't welcome on their celebration trip if you were coming, I stayed back with you.  When you went to grad school in Georgia I visited, and waited for you.  When you came home I quit my job and moved for you.  When I spent every minute of the past six months trying to find a job in the area you'd chosen, so I could spend the rest of my life with you, you ended our relationship.

This is entirely on you.  Tell your parents congratulations, I know this is what they've always wanted and have been pushing you towards for years.  Later on, when they're consoling you and telling you it isn't your fault that it came to this, I hope you have the strength and honesty to correct them.  And that's all I'm going to say about that.

But I'm not going to wallow in self-pity and play the ""what if?"" game.  That's a waste of time.  Instead, I'm going to salvage what's left of my self confidence and move forward.  The one positive outcome of all of this is that now, I have absolutely no plans.  And while not planning out every second of every day was terrifying for Lauren, for me it translates to unlimited possibilities.  I can now move anywhere, instead of being limited to Philadelphia or Wilmington.  I could get a job in the city and share a place with Brandon or Jesse.  Or I could move out to Colorado, or Seattle, or California.  I could drop 40 pounds, leave the cats with my parents, and hike the AT in spring 2010.  I can get a motorcycle.

When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.  And when life takes a big steaming shit on your plate you make shit-ade and like it.  A friend of mine said today, ""The best revenge is to live well.""  I don't want or need revenge, but I can appreciate the point.  Yes, I had thought that Lauren was ""the one"", but she made it abundantly clear that that isn't the case.  The only thing I can do is move on, starting right

Now."

To be honest I wasn't particularly impressed with the interviewer or the facility, but as they say, beggars can't be choosers.  It went well enough, and they said they're still doing round 1 interviews and if I'm selected for round two I'll ""hear back in a couple of weeks.""  But they also said they want someone to start by January.  So, that only leaves so many weeks.

In the meantime, I applied to a job with Sherwin-Williams that apparently didn't exist.  Lauren's brother is a store manager, and was trying to get me into the management training program there, but there weren't any openings in his district.  So I looked online and there was a job posting on Careerbuilder for the exact position, in the Philly district.  That'd work fine, maybe even better.  So I applied for that, and they got back to me pretty quickly.  I spoke with the HR rep briefly yesterday, and she said she'd have the hiring manager contact me.  The hiring manager called me this morning to say that they liked what they saw on my resume and application info, but there aren't any open positions.  The Careerbuilder posting ""auto-renew's itself whether there's a position up or not"", ""sort of like rolling admissions"".  I spoke with Geoff (Lauren's brother) and he seems to think they weren't interested because I implied that I wanted to get management experience and leave for IT work elsewhere.  Here's the kicker- I never mentioned that at all, and HE told them that I might be interested in switching to the IT department after management training.  It sounded to me like a guilty conscience coming out as blame, but I didn't bring that up because I genuinely do appreciate him trying to help me get a lead on a job.

After that I applied for a new job in Mt. Laurel.  It's a support analyst position, and it sounds decent.  I applied on their website, and there was a pre-interview process to screen candidates, which I passed.  Now my info gets passed to the hiring manager and I wait on that.  

Back to the drawing board while I wait on UPenn and the new job."

"event","I went to bed at around 9:15 last night.  I could barely stay awake that long.  That's what happens when you pull an all-nighter against your will.  Anyway, I took both the melatonin and the sleep blend.  I had no problem falling asleep, but I woke up every few hours.  I do that anyway, so I don't know if the stuff I took had any effect or not.

But I set my alarm for 9am, figuring like most places  U Penn would open around 8am, and I'd give them some time to get organized before calling.  Well, I got a call from them at 7:30.  It was.. odd.  The guy I spoke with basically said they'd gotten my resume and application, do I want to come in for an interview on November 7th.  No questions for me, nothing.  He said he'd send an email with directions, and I asked if he could send any more information about the position, such as hours, duties, salary, etc.  He said he couldn't tell me about the salary as that's handled by HR.  Um.. ok.  The email I got had a link to the school's generic page on how to get to the campus, nothing specifically about his building.  The whole thing just feels weird, but for lack of other options I'll follow through with it and see what happens."

"event","Got some cards for my Dad's birthday.  One is silly and is supposed to be from Oliver, I think he'll get a laugh out of it.  The other one is kind of sappy but it's the closest thing to an acceptable card that I could find after visiting several stores.  Most of the cards I saw just plain sucked.  Oh well.

I picked up some Melatonin and a ""sleep blend"".  I've used Melatonin before, but I'm interested to see how the blend works.  It has:  Valerian Root, Hops, Skullcap, Passion Flower, Dandelion Root, Chamomile, Marshmallow Root, and Hawthorn Berry.  Pretty much a bit of everything that mellows you out and makes you sleepy.  The thing that concerns me is that the entire dosage per serving is 400mg, whereas the plain valerian root capsules they had were 450mg.  So we'll see if a little bit of everything works as well as one good dosage of one thing.  I have a feeling that one capsule of the blend and one of the melatonin and I'll be out like a light.

I also got a car mount for my cell phone.  I recently got an HTC Touch, a nifty little touchscreen iPhone-like gadget.  I don't have a data plan, but it'll run GPS anyway, so I've been using it for that.  So now I can mount the phone on my dash like a proper GPS, and charge it with the charger I got from Sprint.  Much more useful than the mount with built-in charger that didn't actually mount to the window OR charge the phone.

Oh yeah, a piece of good news.  I applied for two new jobs this morning, around 6-7am after I got up and had breakfast (remember, I didn't sleep last night so I got up at 5am).  One was at a school district in rural Delaware, and the other was at U Penn (University of Pennsylvania- right outside of Philly proper).  I got a call around 4:15pm from a girl there, who left me a voicemail.  I called back and got their voicemail.  I'm going to call first thing in the morning because she said they wanted to set up an interview, which is a pretty good sign since I haven't done much more than fill out their web application so far.  U Penn is in a good location, and although the job ad didn't say anything about salary, the nice part about working for a University is that it usually involves some degree of free or reimbursed classes.  That being the case, I could be a bit more flexible on the salary, since most of my saved money would be going towards my next degree anyway.  I don't want to get ahead of myself here, so I'll just leave it at that and update if and when I actually talk to them."

"event","What's happened since September?  It's hard to remember.  All this sitting around this house makes each day blend together.  It's a bit mind numbing.  I also didn't sleep last night at all (I'm still awake), so here's what I can remember while being a bit ""foggy"":

Went to NYC to visit family for the Jewish new year.  Same as it ever was.  After that I went to visit Brandon at the restaurant where he works, and had a bit to drink.  It was fun to blow off a bit of steam.

Visited Lauren for a few days.  We went to her apple festival, which was kind of like bizzaro Ithaca Applefest.  Applefest has live music with a whole bunch of food vendors and a few craft booths, many of which are food-related.  Ithaca is a food and wine town.  If you don't like one or both... well, there's still plenty to see and do, but you're missing out.  The Jersey apple festival had live music, a few food booths, and a whole bunch of craft booths.  But the Jersey one had a cool old barn.

Went back to NYC to visit Amy for parents' weekend.  No, I'm not her parent, but then neither are my grandparents.  It was a lot of standing around a street fair (for the men in the family anyway), lunch at an interesting multi-ethnic restaurant near NYU (The Olive something, I think), and more street fair.

Other than that, I've been applying to just about every job that even resembles what I'm looking for, and so far it seems I'm merely tilting at windmills.  The NYC job was ""filled internally"" (which I think is an outright lie and euphemism for ""thanks but no thanks) and the Temple U job stopped responding to me.  There was another one I had a phone interview with in Pennsylvania, but I think they picked a candidate willing to accept a sub $30k salary.   Giving up is not an option, so I've been pressing on.  Most recently I applied for a position at U Penn, and one at a school in Delaware, about 20 minutes from Smyrna.

Today is my dad's birthday.

Not much else to report.  I'm going to try to find some melatonin supplements to use to get back on a normal sleep schedule, since at this point it's not unusual for me to go to bed shortly after my dad leaves for work.  I may look up some valerian/skullcap/hops/etc as well, or instead, if I can find someplace that has them.  I wish there was a place like Greenstar around here that has lose herbs, but I haven't found one yet.  Oh well.  Perhaps I'll update when I get home."

"event","I just had a phone interview with Temple University (Philly) about a general tech support position down there.  The interview went about as expected with all the usual questions- tell me about your job experience, what kind of technical background do you have, what do you do when clients make you want to stab yourself in the eye with a fork, etc.  Apparently ""stab myself in the eye with a fork"" is not the correct answer.  Go figure.  But the job wouldn't be too bad, and it'd be close enough to where Lauren will be working.

On the other end of the spectrum, I've got a job lead in NYC.  It's for a Sales Engineer position, which isn't quite what it sounds like.  In the realm of high-end technical products, eventually the stuff you're selling gets too complex for sales drones to fully explain.  Sure, they can tell you it'll stop spyware/viruses/AOL ads, but at some point someone is going to ask what makes your method better, or what algorithms it uses, or what kind of encryption it employs.  And that's why you need a sales engineer.  They're essentially a mix between a regular computer engineer (read: Geek) and a salesperson.  But finding a skilled computer geek who can talk to clients and isn't afraid of presenting to large groups is apparently very rare.  So a recruiter found my resume on Careerbuilder, and thinks I'm a ""very good candidate"" for this position.  I've been following through with the application process, but we'll see what happens.  He says ""they're looking for someone with many of the skills listed, but not all, so they can 'groom them into the position'"".  If that's true, that'd be great.  There's a lot of stuff on the application that I'm not really familiar with (very advanced computer-related concepts).  On the other hand, I've got the right background for the position (pre-sales support experience, Speech Communication degree, and I happen to be a computer geek too).  The salary for this position is literally twice that of the one at Temple U- roughly $80k.  That makes me think that unless they're really up for training me fairly extensively, they're going to give the job to someone with more computer chops.  It'd also be almost a two hour commute each way, which would suck, but the experience would be invaluable.  

The Temple U job is more realistic, but the other one would be great too.  I'm still looking for other positions in case neither of them work out, but I'm hoping at least one of them does."

"event","So, yeah.  This past weekend I went to visit some relatives who I haven't seen in a really long time.  It was not a fun experience.  How to describe it... 

The father of the house is a very likable guy, with a sharp mind and a quick wit.  Unfortunately, his body is rapidly deteriorating.  Due to morbid obesity, he had to have spinal surgery, which went bad, doing more harm than good.  Fairly recently he lost 99% of his vision due to diabetes.  His lungs don't really work properly, he can't stay awake for more than an hour at a time, and he's completely miserable and in a lot of pain.  He gets around in this crazy robo-wheelchair that reclines completely so he can take spontaneous naps.  All things considered, he's holding up remarkably well- or at least he does a good job of internalizing much of his agony.  Unfortunately, I think it's the latter.

His wife is nice enough.  She's unhealthily overweight though, and seems to enjoy a cocktail or two.  They have two kids, a girl about my age and a boy a few years younger.  The girl is even more overweight.  The boy is normal weight, but has some severe learning disability (that wasn't discussed) and possibly some other condition, which along with his medication, made him edgy, abrupt, and more than a little immature.  Apparently at 20 he still hadn't finished high school, because the school told them there was nothing more they could do for him.

I went with my parents and grandparents.  The plan was to hang out there, because they're selling their multi-million dollar house on several acres (with TWO lakes) to pay for the father's medical bills.  We were going to have a BBQ, but it turned into dinner inside.  The house itself was incredible, beautiful, and huge.  The basement had a home theater area / bar / workshop that was probably larger than my apartment in Ithaca.

Dinner was a two hour or so session of listening to my grandparents and the father compare medical problems and medicine, interspersed with comments about how much it sucks that so many people they know are dead.

...yeah.  And then they served cake.  I don't think I've ever seen as many people at one table that reluctant to eat cake.  I think the son summed it up best after dinner with a completely unprovoked comment- ""Want to know why I work out?  If you eat like the rest of my family you'll f***ing die.""  If that's not motivation for hitting the gym I don't know what is.

In unrelated news, I've now applied to over 20 jobs and only gotten two responses.  One was very interested and had even heard of my previous employer, but absolutely could not offer more than $30k.  The other wrote me an email requesting a second copy of my resume, and hasn't responded to multiple contact attempts since.  If I wake up at a reasonable hour tomorrow, I'm going to go over to the park.  I'm really starting to lose it cooped up here in my room.  There's only so many times you can go to the same websites, and nobody is around in town.  I don't even have money to burn, so I can't go hang out at the coffee shops or bars and job search while out of the house.  I never intended to be home this long, and I'm ready to leave.  Someone hire me please?"

So what's happened since then?  I went to Eric and Amanda's wedding, and Jeff and Jenn's wedding, both of which were a lot of fun.  Then I went to Lauren's for a ""week at the beach"" which turned out to actually be around three hours at the beach.  Took an impromptu road trip to New Paltz with Brandon to hit the bars with his frat buddies.  Amy went off to college at NYU this past weekend.

Aside from that, I've been applying to jobs.  And sitting around the house waiting for responses.  And being really, really bored.  Like, measuring the grass in the front yard daily to see how much it grows bored.  No, not really.  But yes, that bored.  I can't really go anywhere because my cell phone never works so I have to be home in case the phone rings.  Aside from which, nobody is ever around in the MRC so there's nothing to be doing anyway.  But I'm getting pretty tired of spending all day at home, every day.  Someone make a decent job in Philly or Wilmington hire me already, eh?"

Quick funny story:
Thursday morning before I got up to leave for the wedding, I had a weird dream.  In it, Matt and I were driving along in his car in what looked like somewhere around the Ithaca hills.  Shortly after we ended up stalling in someone's front lawn I realized that he had been smoking and was way too stoned to be driving, so we switched places.  I got the car back on the road and found myself at the bottom of a steep hill.  After adjusting the seat so I could better reach the clutch, I remember thinking how easily the car shifted.  Almost immediately after that, I couldn't find the pedals- ANY of them.  

I woke up when Oliver jumped back up onto the bed.  Apparently that first ""shift"" was actually me waking him up by kicking him off of the bed, which also explains why I couldn't find the pedals anymore!"

"event","I applied for a job north of Wilmington, DE today.  Shortly after applying, I smelled something sharp and funky.  Turns out my mother was making garlic bread downstairs and the whole house reeked of it.  Not thinking anything of it, I went downstairs for dinner.  When I went back upstairs, the smell was worse.  I had left my computer on, and it was off.  And, it wouldn't turn on.  At all.

Crap.

It looks like my power supply burned out, and smells like it too.  So tomorrow I get to go drop $200 on a similar PSU to see if anything else works, or if it took everything else with it, kicking and screaming on its rapid descent into power supply hell.

Some people tell me I have an overactive imagination."

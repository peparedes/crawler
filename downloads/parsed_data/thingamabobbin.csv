"event","have I become my enemy? I mean, I used to speak, and everyone would listen. People liked talking to me. But these days it's like I have nothing to say. Well, plenty to say, but I never say it. And when I do say something, it seems vastly unimportant to other people, which seriously encourages me to keep my mouth shut. Am I boring? at least I know im boring myself. which means, of course, I will have to result to drastic measures. I hope I don't come out too damaged...but at least I wont be bored of myself. I'd rather be dead than that...

"event","Okay, not the best of days for me....I'm not really going to go into my day at school, because it was simply horrible, but I kept a positive attitude, I mean, just cause you have a bad day at school, doesn't mean your day can't get better, right? Even if it has been raining for 25 days straught....and for awhile, my day did get better. Mike took me shopping in Silverdale and I bought a few things which always raises my mood, and I was excited because Kimo had told me earlier this week that he might call tonight. Well, he did call, with bad news. Not only is he not going to visit in Febuary, but his superiors removed him from his platoon (1/7) which is like, the best, and moved him to 3/4 simply because there were too many people in his platoon. And Kimo is one of the best, too! So now he wont get to go overseas to a hot spot and recieve the bonuses and medals that are a part of that. now he will be waiting longer to go to a less active and more controled area where theres less pay and no medals! That just isnt right! Kimo has worked his ASS off for these people, and how do they repay him? by taking away the one thing he wants most. It's sickening. I can't even comprehend it, or look into how he feels. I can't imagine, and for me, thats saying something. I wish I could get a hold of one of those sargents, thats what I wish! I have a few choice things that I would like to say! those pig-headed pompous arses of a roug elephant! Kimo says that they have that right, but in my opinion, they have to realize that these are MEN they are dealing with! Flesh, blood and emotions...PRIDE! not some tank or gun they can order from a catalog. Kimo has a future! a family! He has me too! Does none of that matter? Is the country not made out of it's citizens? and if theyre not fighting for it's citizens, who the hell are they fighting for? Kimo and I are making plans for our future together, but now all I can think about is how wrong it seems that they can treat him so horribly? Who is there for him? Who is there to support him? Who can he trust now? It's just not right...A man deserves to know where his life is going. He should have at least SOME stability in his life...Kimo seems to be on a shakey foundation and is made to jump on it at it crumbles whenever he is given an order. what happens if it breaks? There is no justice.

For the last couple of days I've been concentrated on getting Debbie settled and stuff...today is shopping, for which the only thing that I will be able to afford, is paying off the rest of the pair of boots I have on layaway. sigh... would have liked at least on more skirt, but oh well.  School is starting soon!  I'm kinda stoked about it now...it doesn't look all that difficult...I'm stuck in an iron works class now though...I really dont want to do it, but they won't let you have a free period....EVER.  so that's messed up...and theres nothing available in that time slot that I want to take...maybe there will be an opening after next tri...thats when I'd have to take the class...I mean, come on...me? with a TORCH?  WELDING THINGS?  doesn't sound like such a good idea if you know my track record with hot things and accidents happening..."

"event","SO anyway, my6 day had TONS, just TONS of ups and downs. Im becoming very close to hating my mother. i mean, i love her...but the whole guilt thing is really bugging me..everythings repeating what i say in under breath and then saying, I hate this stage..and then shes all, I wondered when we'd reach this stage with you...what FREAKING STAGE! if she wasnt on my back all the time about every little things and calli9ng me every hour and a half wondering where i am...everyone know im a good girl..i dont do ANYTHING wrong! what wont she leave me the hell alone!?!I know I may not seem to have a right to omplain..Im far from a desolate child..but SHE>>IS>>>PISSING>>ME>>>OFFF!!!!!!!!!I mean, Im not used to feeling this toward my MOTHER! its like...ggggGGGRRRRRAAARRRRGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!?!?!I wen to a ballet recital..she calls me in the middle of it...""Oh, I thought it would be over by now.."" I go to the movies, forget to turn of me cell...dodoeodoe...doeodoe...doeodoedtatataa...doo doedldoe...""Oh, I thought it would be over by now."" Parties, dinner...she even called me TWICE today when i was taking a very simple walk home from the park that I do ALL THE TIME!!!I answer..""Are you safe? Are you healthy?"" its like, no mom, im being raped by twelve men in bunny suits and spike collars, i think i have issues..no, i didnt really say that..but i mean, COME ON! LEVE ME THE HELL ALONE! since when did she become like this? the more she does it, the less I want her to have ANYTHING to do with my life.  I used to be free, i culd do anything I wanted..now all of the sudden, Im not trustworthy...why? because I forgot my cell phone at home ONCE and no one was home when I called home and they couldnt contact me till 9 o clock in the evening. ONE TIME! like, THREE MONTHS AGO! ZI didnt do anything wrong even! I left a message saying id be at the track meet and would call when I was ready to go home.  I went to the track meet...I called when I was ready to go home! except they werent there! so I went to have pizza! and then I got in HUGE trouble! and had to listen to guilt trip after guilt trip from BOTH parents! I should run away somewhere and show them when they should REALLY start to worry! SERIOUSLY!....pbbbtttt! im done. thank you."

1. Who are you? 
2. Are we friends? 
3. When and how did we meet? 
4. Do you have a crush on me? 
5. Would you kiss me? 
6. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 
7. Describe me in one word. 
8. What was your first impression? 
9. Do you still think that way about me now? 
10. What reminds you of me? 
11. If you could give me anything what would it be?

"event","When you walked into the room
My heart was in my smile
And when you held me in your arms
I swear, I flew for miles

I felt so free and happy
never afraid or alone
With you right there beside me
I felt like I was home

But now youve gone away again
and I am left confused
because I am none of those things
in compliments you used

I'm sneaky and selfish
Wild and untamed
Shy and introverted
Outgoing and insane

I'm not all that caring
obedient? give me a break.
But you were right beside me
when the new things made me shake

I am in ways a child
My future yet unclear
I think only of the moment
but this moment, youre not here

I feel you everywhere I go
I took you to every place
Now all I see are memories of you
but I cannot see your face

If I think of you, really try
then your face will appear
but its not like it is really there
It's not like you are here.

So I am lonely once again
Heaven knows youre not to blame
Its not your fault I fell in love
we both knew youd leave when you came

At least we're still together
though so very far apart
I just want you to know your with me
Deep inside my heart."

"event","Ever laughed at something that wasn't funny?

Made it a joke to hide the pain?

But inside your heart cries

Tears and blood that fall like rain.


You know it shouldn't matter

What other people say

So you smile your bright sun smile

And look the other way


 You keep your emotions locked uptight

Inside a hollow glass ball

You know its fragile, You know it will break

Will Shatter as it falls


But you don't want to cause anyone the pain you feel

So you hide it in your heart

but how much room is left

Once the pain takes up it's part?


And once it's planted there

oh so deep within

How do you set it free again?

How can you possibly win?


You've hidden it so well, you see

That it's impossible to find

It sits there and festers still

Inside your soul and mind


The invisable demons that

inprison your bodily cell

drink up every saddened tear

feast on every hope that fell.


Can you save me from all this?

Find my long lost key?

Unlock the dam of tears and pain

And flood out the demons in me."

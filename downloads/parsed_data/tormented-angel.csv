"event","Do NOT work at Starbucks people, it's utter death. On top of a sorry day at work, my ex boyfriend came in with another girl! Now I don't know if it's 'just' a friend, but she was still gorgeous, and I was still...wiping down tables in my oh-so-fabulous Starbucks attire.

You know that cliche ""I wanted the floor to swallow me whole""? That does not compare to this mortification. I suppose if you knew the background history between me and ex, you understand that much more. 

Oh well, another story for aother time."

Ugh, Football training is starting and as such, seemingly hundreds of muscle bound idiots are strutting their stuff on campus in the quad where conveniently, everyone can see. Why must this college be so focused on sports?! I'm very fed up with all of the athletes being treated like gods around here, and what's worse are the girls that throw themselves at them. It was definately enough to stop be from going to frat parties after freshman year. And what's THE worst? All of these jocks are here on scholarship, while I take out student loan after student loan.

Atleast I have a livejournal so I can now rant all I want about the injustices in my life! *wink*"

"event","I finally got a livejournal code thanks to <lj user=""emo_activist"">, thanks for that:) I do have to point out that aside from the random posting of my poetry, my photos or topics to be dicussed, this journal will be friends only. Add me if you think we have anything in common. I'll add you back (unless you're a weirdo).

Thank you,

Well, things have been great. I went to visit Ole Miss, which was a lot of fun. Things have changed though..not for the bad, but for the good. There's this one person who I thought was my friend, but she's really a f' bitch! Anyway-I'm not going to criticize, but rather go on with my life. 

Billy and I are getting better by the minute! We've grown a lot closer and we enjoy every minute with eachother. On the weekends, I mainly go to College Station because a) it's a hell of a lot more fun than Houston and b) I stay the night with him. At night we either just chill at the casa or go out, but we'd rather just chill and drink because we don't have any distractions and we can spend more quality time together. Isn't it great!? When we wake up..we always go to La Bodega, which is a bad ass breakfast place...then we take the dogs out walking and to the park so they can swim and chase the ducks. He inspires me...makes me feel like a better person. He teaches me things about life..things I never thought of. He knows more than others, and is extremely smart. We have fun together- a kind of fun that I have never experienced before. 

Enought about Billy-he isn't that great!!! Just kidding honey! As for friends...I rarely keep in contact with friends from Ole Miss-sometimes. There's this girl named Kristen who was a Pi-Phi at Ole Miss and who lived in the dorm that I did my freshman year....she goes to the University of Houston now, and we've hung out during the week some. I have lots of friends at UofH, but I don't really hang out or party with them because i'm always with my boyfriend. I don't care though. I see these peeps everyday, I don't see my country boy but only on the weekends.

Oh, and guess what? Billy and I have decided that we are going sky diving one time during spring break, oh..and of course we're going to a beach. We are thinking maybe somewhere in Florida or Mexico, but we'll have to see. That shit gets expensive. Hopefully, yall peeps from Ole Miss will come with us! 

Anyway, I'm going to get out of here. I'm tired! Damn, I feel like an old fart...it's only 9:00!

"event","You know...maybe i'm just an over-analyzer, maybe I just think about the negatives instead of the positives. I would consider myself to be a sweet, loving, caring person. I love my family and my friends. ALL of my friends. I don't just have a friend and not pay two shits to them-you would call that an acquaintance instead of a friend. Yes, I know that I have made my mistakes in the past, but you learn from them, you move on, and you build stronger relationships. I am real excited about this weekend. I have not seen my friends in almost 6 months-much longer than I expected. It's going to be busy there at Ole Miss, but I hope everything turns out they way I want it to. I'm kinda upset right now-I feel that i'm not wanted and that nobody cares about how I feel. I'm just going to ignore it and go on with my business. Oh well, shit happens!

To Fair, Kate, Casey, and Mo-Mo:
Yall are my girls, my best friends. The best times of my life have been with yall. You girls have given me strength and courage when I needed yall the most. I just want yall to know that I love you, and I hope that our friendship never changes!! Each of yall are special and yall are so much fun!!!!!! I hope we have a blast when I come to Oxford!"

"event","Billy and I got in a lil fight- I told him that I didn't like being far apart and not seeing eachother for 2 weeks. His response was..""It's not what we want, but what we have to do...blah blah blah, don't let it sour your attitude, okay?"" I admit, I was being a bitch, but, still...it made me mad that I haven't seen him. Not his fault nor mine. Well, I hadn't talked to him from tuesday until Friday..only though text messages...I go to bed when he gets home...but, anyway--the plan was for me to drive to College Station and stay the weekend with him. Since I didn't hear from him, I wasn't going to go until he called. Well, I got a text message in response to mine saying that he was sorry-his phone was messed up. Which I believe because his phone service sucks there. Gettin back to my story, I decided to surprise him by showing up unannounced. Usually when I go to see him, I leave Houston before 2pm and get there around 3-330. Well, this time I didn't leave until 7pm because I went to his parents house to get his dog and bring her with me. Well, Bessie (the dog) and I got to his house and he was so shocked. It was great! This weekend was great! Friday night we got a lil drunk, just him and I, went to bed early...and, well...I won't say anything else! haha--We woke up around noon, got some lunch, went grocery shopping, watched the astros game, went and saw friday night lights, came back watched another movie, went to On the border, drank a few beers...then I fell asleep on his shoulders! He carried me into his room and put me to sleep! Awe!! Then today we watched the astros game again and I came back home around 5! It was a great weekend...He said that it was perfect-just us two chillin and not really partying! Awe how nice is that!

Well, I leave thursday for memphis!! SNAPS! Get excited! hehe-I'm trying to get my dad to boot one of his friends off the jet so Billy can come to the game and then fly back out with them. We'll see how that works! 

Now it's time for school work! Ew gross!! School sucks!

I get to see Billy this weekend. I haven't seen him for 3 weeks. I've been working, he's been working, and he's been in Canada. I'm going to feel a little weird when I first see him though. Oh well.

He told me that it hurt him to see that he was unable to help me out in the situation that I was in. He said that his feelings for me a growing stronger and he cares so much for me. 

What am I going to do? He doesn't know about me going to Ole Miss next semester. He'll be out of school in May, but what is he going to do after that? There are so many decisions. I hate making decisions, but like someone said...Life is full of tough decisions.

I was hoping to go visit my peeps at Ole Miss October 14th, but by the looks of it, I don't know. I called to see if I could get someone to pick me up, but nobody would return my call. It's $400 more to fly into Memphis....that's $400 I could spend on clothes and shoes...lol ;)

Well, we'll see what happens...I might just have to ride on the jet to Oxford and fly right back out that same night--but, if i'm going to do that...my boyfriend is just going to have to come with me!"

Billy is going out of town this weekend. Every year he goes to Canada for school-all expenses paid. How nice is that? Well, the exciting news between him and I is that we are couple. We really don't believe in titles anymore-but, we are together and everything is going great. He loves kids...which is a major plus. Once a week he volunteers at an elementary school and helps a little kid read. How sweet is that?!?! He's adorable! 

I'm getting closer and closer to visiting Ole Miss. I'm so excited! It's something that i'm looking foward to! YEAH!

Okay, here is how my weekend went- Billy came in town Friday night,and I got sooo dressed up and ready for him. He didn't even show up. He went out with some friends. It's okay cause I went to sleep. Saturday during the day he came to my house and we just layed around and played all day. At night we went to Score cards and got a little tipsy. Well, I wanted to go home and he didn't...so I had to get my brother to come get me...my parents were in downtown chillin at a bar. ASSES! Today, Wayne and Stacy had a BBQ goin at their house....I'm a lil tipsy right now, but it's okay. They have a baby girl named JADA, and I want her! She's the cutest thing ever!!! I looked at billy when I saw her and he was like...No no, casey...not now! haha! he loves me though..it's okay! Anyway, I won't see him for 2 weeks. He's going on a trip with the forestry club. Yea, he's going to be a game warden!

"event","Today was an all right day. I went to school and did some work, went to class, then, went to work. For some reason, work just wasn't fun today, and it's usually always fun for me. I have to work a lot this week, so, i'm already looking forward to the weekend. After work, I did some studying, worked out, and did some more studying. It seems like all I do now is study and work. Which isn't bad, it's just a HUGE ASS change from what I was doing this past spring semester. Speaking of this weekend, I don't know if i'm going to College Station. Billy gets his ring, but I don't know if he's going to get dunked one time with his friends and then another time with his parents, or if he's going to do it all at once. If that's the case and he's going to wait, then, I won't go to CS this weekend. He can come here to Houston. We're going camping. haha-When I got back home from spending the weekend with him...I was telling my mom about how Billy and I (and friends) decided to go camping..She started laughing...she thought I was kidding...She thinks I won't be able to survive with all the bugs and shit, but you know what, just watch me! hehe! Now, i'm not going hiking like he does and carry all that shit on your back. Screw that! 

I have a test tomorrow...yuck...and another one on Thursday....yuck!!!!

I had a dream the other night--I had a little baby girl. Her name was Caroline. (I never thought of naming my girl that!)She was sooo precious. She had thin blonde blonde hair with ice blue eyes. She was the cutest thing ever. I woke up wondering where she was, but when I looked around and saw Billy, I was like..Damn, nice dream Casey!!! I know, I'm crazy!!! I thought it was for real though. 

Sweet dreams and night night!"

Hurricane Ivan did so much damage to my aunts house in Pensacola. It ripped one side of the house completely off and a tree fell on top of it. My grandfather had a house in Dauphin Island, Alabama, and that's messed up too! I hope the condo in Destin didn't get any damage-which i'm sure it did. I saw a lot of people from Louisiana on i-10 today.

I don't know where this feeling is going to end up, but as of right now, I think I could keep on going awhile with it. It's that feeling that I get when I open my phone and see that he's calling. It's that feeling that I get when he shows up at my house in his truck to take me out. It's that feeling that I get when I want to pay for things but he won't let me. It's that feeling that I get when he looks at me, smiles, and bends over to kiss me (""just because."") (I have to stand on my tippy toes to kiss him!) It's those feelings and more that make me scared of what will happen next. Whether it's good or bad. I take each day, day by day, and hopefully i'll end up where we both want to be. What is going to be the next level? I want to be with him. I love that he plays the guitar. I love that he can cook. I love that he's a cowboy and wears his sexy cowboy hat. I love that he has a motorcycle, and loves riding and lookin at the sunset.I love that he likes to work on his truck in his cute little white t-shirt. I love that he loves talking to my dad about sports. I love everything he does, but how will I know if I love him? 

It's hard that he's an hour away and I don't get to see him during the week, but it makes it more exciting when we see eachother on the weekend.

Here's the best part about my weekend--last night (saturday). Billy came over and we started drinking here at my house. Then, we took the Hummer to Jimmy's loft downtown and met up with a whole bunch of folks. All 50 of us went to Grasshopper and just had an awesome time. It's great cause we get VIP. There was such a long ass line, but we walked up to the front and they checked our ID's and let us in. HAHA--seeing the faces on the people waiting in line..They were like what the hell? I would've been mad if I was the one standing in line though.  Everyone got so hammered! I dropped like $100. Billy pays for everything so I figured i'd be a nice girl and get the tab. Kelly fell down the stairs like a dumbass, which I thought was histerical.

You know what I hate? I hate people that you dated in the past coming back to you and spilling their heart out...even though they know that you have a bf or dating someone. Yes, I had that happen to me. I don't like it. I kept telling my ex-dater (haha) that we are just friends. It makes me sad also. To see that person longing to be in a relationship and to be in love. I'm here for ya babe, but not in the way that you want me to be.

Mr. Guy is coming to Houston tomorrow. I think. We're going downtown for some fun on Saturday! Yea! My mom got this bad ass top from Cache the other day--so, I'm going to wear that!! Oh, and I got some cute pink cowboy boots with a matching straw hat! GO ME!

Billy is gettin dunked soon!! It's when the people that are going to graduate in may get their rings in September--the ring has to be dunked in the beer pitcher and then that person has to drink the whole pitcher until he/she gets to the ring.

Okay, this weekend was badass! I left work early to go to College Station to see him. He is so sweet! I grew up with him..so it's a plus that I know him already. I've been seeing him for about 3 weeks now. He has one year left at Texas A&M. Yes, he's an aggie! He gets his ring this month. I'm so excited for him. Enough about him, even though i'd love to go on and on. So, back to what I was saying. I went to CS on Friday. Got there at about 3:30, and right when he opened the door I was sooo happy to see him. His roomies, him, and I hung out for a while..just chattin and drinking some Corona. Billy and I went to the grocery store got some shampoo and conditioner (cause I left mine at home), and sour cream for Jeff. After we ate fajitas, we went to a bar and played darts. I have never played real darts before. For being drunk, they said I did really good. I think they were just making me feel good though. After that we went back to the house and crashed. I left College Station (sad) at 9:30 in the morning to be at the radio station by 11:30. Well, to my surprise there was a state trooper looking at me, and then, 3 minutes later he decides to pull me over. He gave me a ticket for not having my inspection sticker updated. How fun is that! Then, I got to the Woodlands pavillion (couldn't make it to the station because of the damn cop), and set up for the concert. I hung out with Mark Wills for a little while, he's cute and nice. Well, here comes the best part of all. I'm sittin there with my friends from work when Darrell calls my cell. He tells me to meet him next to the beer stand. He hands me a backstage pass for Clay Walker. I jumped his bones! Boy let me tell you...I was so pumped!! I got back there and was waiting for about 15 minutes. Then, his fine ass comes up to me. We got to chattin for awhile, got his picture takin with me, and his autograph. I would've kissed him, but his wife was there and plus, I like Billy. Now that Clay Walker is off my ""Got to meet!"" list, Johnny Depp is still #1!

Now it's back to school work."

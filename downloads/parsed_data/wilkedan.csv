"event","There was way too much drama this weekend.  I think we all saw it coming.  Hopefully the storm will pass and we can all be wonderful friends.  Until then...

While sitting in a cool quiet place, take several deep breaths and repeat after me , ""Three, Two, One; One, Two, Three; what the heck is bothering me"".  If this doesn't work, just scream at the top of your lungs while punching something.

So today was a MUCH better day.  Nicole and I went to one kickin' party.  I have been so stoked about it for weeks.  She was allowed to invite two people and she invited me!  Don't I feel loved.  We got to the party at 5pm and there were already twenty or so people there.  It was in the backyard of this older gay couple's house.  Nicole and I went directly to the bar and got drinks, then she introduced me to everyone.  I was the youngest person there, just having turned 22.  I met some really interesting people, many of whom had gone down to the beach this weekend for Pencacola Pride.  By far, my favorite new person at the party was Nicole's friend Josh.  I believe he's a T.A. on campus, very nice guy.  Boy can his boyfriend Ryan dress.  Nick I think you may need a lesson!  I hope I get to go to more of these wonderful parties.  Who knew there was an older gay community in this football town."

"event","Boy do I love the McDonald's dollar menu!  I am so broke right now(my fault, lost my check card + my PIN number) and living on change.  So I went to the golden arches for lunch and paid for my 2 double cheeseburgers in nickels and dimes.  Now I'm at my favorite hotel and soooo bored.  We have 14 check-ins left and I will be alone after 7.  Venus, please don't leave me.  Last night Terrance came to see me at work, woo hoo!  Thank you Terrance, I really appreciate it.  Anson called me today; he, Liz, and Daniel(my godson) are doing great.  They get to move into their new house on Tuesday(my birthday).  I can't wait to go home to see them."

"event","Either Jessica is CRAZY or Jimmy cannot give directions.  Jessica called me lost in Birmingham yesterday so I got out my B-ham map and stayed on the phone with her for 15 minutes.  She finally got to the Galleria to meet some friends of hers.  So, last night Taylor and I had dinner at the brand spankin' new Jason's deli.  It was wonderful!!!  We walked in and guess what happens?  I totally get hit on by the manager.  At least I thought so.  That man looked me from head to toe, and then he smiled at me.  Taylor got a wrap and I got a sandwich fit for a king(queen), plus we got free frozen yogurt.  McAlister's is so going to get their butt kicked by Jason's.  Let us all have a moment of silence for Giz, Nick's dog, who died yesterday morning.  Nick grew up with Giz and was very upset yesterday.  If you see him, please tell him how sorry you are.  Wedding planning today was awesome!  Everyone brought in wedding food and we all ate our hearts out.  My partner, Kristi, and I made chicken & egg salad sandwiches.  Today I also helped Amber move her couches out of a friend's apartment.  When we moved the couch out of the room there was a little bag of grass under it, if you know what I mean.  It was fairly old, so it probably wasn't good.  We promptly disposed of it.  Or did we..."

"event","So yesterday after work I hauled ass home to clean house.  Terrance, Jimmy, Kris, and Jessica were coming over after Kris's graduation in B-ham.  I turned up my gay music on the xbox and cleaned like a madman.  Kris brought some champagne he got for a present and we all had a little.  Jimmy and Kris stayed in the living room and I finally got to sleep at 2:30.  Up again for class this morning at 8am.  Woo hoo!  I'm in a wedding planning class taught by Mrs. Boyle.  It is soooo awesome.  Matt Bees and I are the ONLY guys in there, the rest are diet coke drinking sorority girls(I'm just not into diet).  So today we went over to Trinity United Methodist Church and practiced the actual wedding.  Matt is my group's wedding planner and he's wonderful at it.  Boy is he gay!  Mrs. Boyle actually asked Matt and I if we would take our <i>wife's</i> name when we got married.  What is she thinking, is she blind?  I wonder if she's ever had any strait guys in that class before."

"event","On Friday Rachel, Crystal, and I drove to Atlanta for our annual Six Flags trip. We stopped at Pizza Hut for dinner and had a side of glow sticks(Crazy girls, glow sticks are for kids!). Our hotel was NOT up to expectations, considering we booked at a Hampton Inn and arrived at the ""Atlanta Hotel"", with outside hallways and NO shampoo. Other than the hotel, we had a wonderful trip. Saturday we hit the coasters! All were fun as usual, but the best of all was Deja Vu, which we have been waiting to ride for the past 3 years. That was the best ride of my life! So scary, take a look. http://www.sixflags.com/parks/overgeorgia/Rides/dejavu.html The title of this entry refers to a girl standing in line with us at superman. The ride broke down twice while we waited(which makes it even more exciting) and every few minutes this girl would scream ""FIX IT!!!"" at the top of her lungs to the ride operators. We just laughed at her. What a crazy girl. Personally I would be too embarrassed to yell in front of 100+ people. Later, we had dinner at Applebee's with CJ (Crystal's Marine man) and went to bed at the hotel. The girls could not sleep, so they went to Wally world(Wal-Mart) and bought CJ and I a present; Silly string in the face! Grrrrr, that's ok, I love you guys :). As usual, the trip was great, but next year we plan to go to the beach instead. Six flags is <i>so</i> last season."

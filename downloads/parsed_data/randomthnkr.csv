"event","Another uneventful day... not that I'm complaining ;o)... Today is Valentine's Day!  The Day of chocolate and roses... the day of friends and lovers... blah blah blah... Can I just tell you how much bullshit this holiday instills in my mind.  I stand around here and I watch as couples feed each other sugar cookies.  Hmmm yeah isn't that great?   Yeah it's lovely.  It is a day of the most elaborate 'spit' sharing EVER!  



         Next, the corporate America that we know so well has created this holiday to increase the economies consumption of idiotic materials.  It is the middle winter and yet, many go out and spend extra money on flowers.  Chocolates shoved in red paper in a stupid cardboard box are everywhere you look.  Teddy bears hugging big satin hearts are in every convenience store in America.  Men come flying out at the last minute to purchase their wives or girlfriends abundant chocolates or cards or roses or whatever.  Mind you, this is a decided federal holiday... it is on almost every single printed calender.  However, the constant reminder of its upcoming doesn't seem to sink into the male spectrum.  Ironic really.  Its easy to remember, but they almost never do.  Hey when's the superbowl?  Hm... do they usually have the answer to that?
         


             Anyhoo, I'll submit to the day.  I will throw my hands up because I don't think that my pissy remarks are going to stir a nation.  People love the holiday too much and frankly, it does have its perks.  Kindergarten was the best.  We got those little envelopes to put in your valentines.  Everyone got one and no one was left out.  Why don't we do that anymore?  Nobody feels sad or lonely or anything.
   


             I personally have a valentine so to speak, but I don't think about it like most people do.  I admit it.  I don't jump around praising my ability to scoop up some helpless male.  He asked me and I submitted... so now I must conform to the custom of the day.  I pray that I survive this humiliation.

   

Love you all and may you all survive Corporate America's Day of Candy-Rich Purchasing"

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!   Alright, I'm going to become a lesbian and I will be accepting applications for those interested in joining me.  I know of a few guys that would be good at being a lesbian.  It would make sense for them.


   You know what I hate??  I hate it how everyone has this aura surroundign them that just screams of your being better than everyone else.  I loathe that.


   ANd again, smart guys would just open their mouths and say somethign to their 'interest'.  ARGH!  I don't know how many guys have come up to me and said ' You know, I had the biggest crush on you before ' AAAAH! WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING? 


Anyways on a happier note, I didn't take the plunge and accept a certain someone's proposal.  I'm waiting until graduation and if they love me they'll wait too.  


LOVE YOU ALL!"

   Hm, I chatted with a certain fella again.  I talk to him every night now... I dunno if I can understand that.  Maybe if I was some hott ass or somethin... whateva... 

   Kristin came to visit me at school... craziness!  We had a tiny fight... told her I met a guy and she didn't like it too much... I care, but not too much.  She's still attached after being broken up for a couple years.  HEY GIRL GIMME A BREAK!

   My classes are goin well... not too much to be excited about.  I'm studying a whole heck of a lot.  My friends are in them, but don't talk too much now.  LOL!  

   Okay time for my grrrr entry...

    Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to talk about... yes... the dreaded naval... argh!  I completely understand those of you that show your bellybutton when you have something to show, but many of you people are a bit... shall we say... too heavy for that sort of 'air' time.  Please, I'm begging you, cover up the flab.  Be proud of the fact that you are chubby, but cover up the gelatin for those of us with eyes to see with.  I still love you chubby people.  Yall are cuter than skinny folk... many of you are sex-worthy in some people's books.  I am... one of you people anyway... I reach out and accept it... I'm a chubby chick with the intelligence to say NO to short shirts."

"event","This is my first journal... hmmmmm well let's start off with my most recent problem...


I have to dress up for a class presentation tomorrow.  I'm having a little problem finding clothes.  That might have something to do with the enormous pile of laundry forcefully shoved in my hamper.  I stood on top of it for goodness sakes to make room for more.  Now, I would go downstairs and wash my clothes, but another problem has come up.  I don't have any money.  NOW WHAT DO I DO?  Should I do the presentation naked? Hm... as pleasant as that might be...


OH and another thing... men... stop trying to make yourself into a good kisser... there are two things you should know... don't force french... that is a HUGE no-no.  Second, don't drool or try to swallow my face.  EW!  Alright?  Got it?

Okay!  SHOWER TIME!  Then I get a stimulating show of watching as my curly hair expands and explodes around my head!   YAY!  

Love you all!"

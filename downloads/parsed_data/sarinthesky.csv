Having got back from places afar, I have a really rather silly amount of random bits of cheapo knockoff anime goods floating around. Mostly on the large-sheets-of-stickers front. I am clearly never going to use any of these except to ogle, but I'm sure I can find a better home for them, namely with some of <a href=""http://sarinthesky.livejournal.com/friends/"">You</a>. 

So... 

I have stuff from the following fandoms available:

1. Prince of Tennis - loads of all-character sticker sheets - mini and A3
2. Naruto - loads of A3 and mini sticker sheets, plus a few characters, and poster-y A3 stickers
3. Saiyuki - loads of A3 sticker sheets 
4. Angel Sanctuary/Ruroni Kenshin  - 1 poster-y A3 sheet of each

So basically, send me a list of your

- any particular character preferences/chibis
- postal address 
to sarinthesky @ hotmail, and I'll put together a few sheets and post them to you!"

<lj-cut text=""Never give your laptop to a well meaning Techie""> 

I took my laptop in to be configured for the lab network. I gave it to Mr Techie guy who said no problems he'll get it done right away.
Two hours later I head back expecting to find nice configured laptop.
Instead, a ghost reformatter was running. 

""Oh"" says he. ""You were running XP home not XP network, so I'm making a copy of your system and reformatting it to XPNetwork.""

""Will everything run the same?"" asks I.

""Oh yes"" says he. ""Mostly.""

<i>""MOSTLY?""</i>I query.

""Oh yes, mostly."" Says he. ""You might have to reinstall a few of your programs but all your files will be there.""

(Note at this point: ALL my program cds/backup files are in ENGLAND. Which is very far from AUSTRALIA as the crow flies or more relevantly, the CD Doesn't. )

I quote from my notebook: 

<i>AAAARGH He's Reconfiguring my laptop to XPNetwork And I'm going to have to 
reinstall ALL MY PROGRAMS AAARGH!!!! They're BACK IN ENGLAND AAAARGH!!

My Adobe Premiere Pro install is a rip and Not Re-gettable by anything remotely easy. And my AMV bunnies are just returning! 

I proceed at this point to have a major internal wibble attack. 

LUCKILY I go back. Apparently because I've just downloaded about 10 gigs of Bleach, by hard drive didn't have enough space to take the reformat, and it's back to normal. 

So I have my photoshop. I have my 238473 different programs of which only about half work and the other half I have to toggle with to get to work but IT DOESN'T MATTER.

<lj-cut text=""Sari's guide to being a Bleach Good Guy"">

Sari's guide to being a Bleach Character:

1.  Find an excuse to have a big ass fight with Bad Guy. 
2.  Don't stop to talk and work out why you might be fighting. Talking it out is for wusses and people without big ass swords to do the arguing. Just jump right in the moment someone you don't recognise turns up. (Insult them for extra points.)
3.  Have big ass fight. 
4.  Have Bad guy tells you how many times more powerful he is than you.
5.  Get mortally wounded. 
6.  Bleed A Lot.
7.  Have Bad Guy taunt you a bit. And leave you just alive for (insert <strike>lame excuse</strike> purposes of continuing storyline here). 
8.  Un-mortally wound self (tip: find handy Squad 4-er, or have spiritual experience with sword). 
9.  Find handy trainer (look for ex-Shinigami with mysterious past).
10. Get handy trainer to set you a training program that's so tough you might die.
11. Almost die.
12. Have angst. (Think about friends/family/Rukia and how you have to save them because they're all depending on you etc.)
13. Go RAAAARGH. 
14. Glow a bit.
15. Get new sword. 
16. Shake yo' ass.
17. Pass training faster than anyone else has EVAR (get bonus points for every person commenting on this)
18. Challenge the guy who beat you last
19. Almost die again
20. Pull out new and improved attack. 
21. Strike a pose.
22. Look shocked as evil opponent pull out even better attack whilst boasting how many times more powerful he still is than you.
23. Almost die (for Real this time, honestly...)
24. Have angst. (See above. Add in flashback of your I-almost-died-training). 
25. Pull out even-specialler-than-you attack
26. Have random bystander and/or opponent comment on how many times more powerful you are than last time. 
27. Go RAARGH.
28. Glow a bit.
29. Win
30. Leave opponent to have a character moment/look incredulous at your new uber power/angst
31. Hawk up a bit of blood for effect.
32. Walk away to angst on about above friend/family/Rukia
33. Have comical interaction with side character
34. Insert filler
35. Find new Ultimate Opponent.
36. Rinse. Repeat.
</lj-cut>

Also: scenes you seldomly see in Bleach #1:

Guy 1: I Will Kill You!
Guy 2: Wait a minute, why are you going to kill me?
Guy 1: Because you oppose what I want to do. Which is xxxxxx
Guy 2: Ohhhh because I'm opposing you for exactly the same reason. We're not enemies! 
Guy 1: Ah! Isn't it good we worked that out before resorting to trying to kill one another!

"event","So, I just finished 'I Capture the Castle' by Dodie Smith. (Ahem...revision...ahem...)
<lj-cut text=""Has anyone else read it?Majorly spoilery"">

I...liked it. I really liked the understanding and change and development of Cassandra throughout the book. I loved the descriptions and points of view on trying to capture a moment - allegories to religious experience, love etc. I loved the character of the genius/barmy father. I loved the depiction of the flawed but sympathetic rose. I loved the little moments in it that just...speak to you.  I'm not so sure about the depiction of tru wuv - maybe I get irrationally irritated by stories where there's a first one true love and it means everything by the end of the book it's still the one true love and nothing else can change it. I guess, the description, of being in love, great, but I also feel that you can be in love, and then fall out of it, and life goes on, and it's not over because the one true love is.  But also, I can see why it's written like that, because there were so many moments with Cassandra and Simon where you were like they'd be so good together - their mutual love of poetry etc. 

but DAMN Stephen!!!!! My heart goes out completely and utterly to Stephen and I just couldn't bear it for the way things go for him. The wireless...the way everything he was doing was for her... And the irony, of how Cassandra is treating Stephen, when she doesn't love him, and how Simon is treating her, as far as I read into the book. About the cruelty of giving someone false hope, allowing them to fall even more for you, making it even more painful for them in the long run. 

I don't know, maybe Simon will get over Rose and happy ever after. Maybe Cassandra will get over Simon and live happily ever after. But I love the bit in it where she says happily ever after is like hitting a brick wall, like the characters die at that point. Word. I remember someone saying somewhere - there's no such thing as happy endings. Endings happen when someone dies, or you fall apart, and are almost always painful. And that all we have are happy middles, and to enjoy those bits, for that's what we are given. Also the irony, how in the beginning when they were poor, you could say there was a naive happiness to it both from Stephen and Cassandra, and it's only with the coming of the Cottons that there are moments of joy, but also much more grief and melancholy. The 'coming of age' from Cassandra - knowing this would be her last midsummer eve, and the mannequin in her room, was all quite bittersweet too. 

I did however absolutely adore the descriptions of the castle. Transported you there.   It's funny - it's one of those books that everyone seems to have read, and despite me reading almost anything I got my hands on, I seem to have missed out on. Like 'What Katy Did', or 'Black Beauty' or 'Great Expectations' I've nevre got round to reading. Admittedly most of my reading was from the books around our house, and my parents reading taste you could call...eclectic...(choice between crossword puzzle books or trashy scifi...) but there we go. Very glad I read it."

<b>Friend</b>: No way. I mean, there's only so much pie can do. It doesn't have like, emotions, or complexity.
<b>Me</b>: Ok, think of a situation.
<b>Friend</b>:  How about, erm, going to work? Pie isn't like going to work because work sucks 90% of the time.
<b>Me</b>: Yes, but so does cooking pie. It takes hours of preparing, and rolling dough and waiting for it to bake. However in the end, we all cook pie because the rewards are worth it in the end. 
<b>Friend</b>:  Ok I'll concede that. How about...hmmmm... Men. Because like, pie is always good, and reliably enjoyable. But not complex. 
<b>Me</b>:Ah, but you see, choosing men is like choosing pie. You go around looking at different pies, perhaps tasting a few, and like, you're always looking for certain characteristics - like crispiness of crust, or gravy. Though you have to consider whether you can afford them.
<b>Friend</b>:  Ah true. And like, you could go on trying pies for ever, looking for the perfect pie, and never buy one. 
<b>Me</b>: Exactly, because either like, the shops will shut, or someone else will go and buy the pie you liked but didn't buy because you thought you might like a better one.
<b>Friend</b>:  Yup, and in the end, you've just got to say ""I like this pie. It may not have the crispiest crust, or quite enough gravy, but damn it in the end I'm happy with this pie, and though there may be tastier, more perfect pies in the world, I'm making the decision to buy this pie.""
<b>Me</b>: Or alternatively you could just buy all the pies. Though you might be sick if you ate them all at once. And they might get jealous of one another. 
<b>Friend</b>:  You are right. The world can indeed be described in terms of pie."

2. I haven't slept on a mattress for about 3 years now - I had a time when I had back problems, so I shifted to sleeping on the floor which was much much better. Have since compromised with a futon.

3. On the subject, I can sleep Absolutely Anywhere. Including in a bath, on top of a garden table and once when we were camping and our tent blew down and it was raining and fitting 5 people in a car to sleep doesn't really work unless someone sleeps in a ball in the boot. 

4. I have to read books all the way through once I start them - everything else takes second place until I've finished the damn thing!

5. I'm an absolute serial doodler - it is physically impossible for me to hold a pen without drawing on something, including myself.

"event","Just went to see The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.

<lj-cut text=""I'm such a dork"">

It's funny how a film can bring back so many memories.

I'd totally forgotten reading the books - I knew obviously that I had, but couldn't remember when and how. It was only when watching the film that it started coming back. I remembered my pre-prep school, which was run by a group of stuck-in-the-70's 'progressive' hippy types who believed that children shouldn't be forced to do anything they didn't want to. Like for instance, learn to read. I remember being the only person in the entire class who could actually read words. I remember the only reason I got accepted at my prep school was because the book they gave me to read ""The little red hen"" was one I knew off by heart, so it looked like I could read fluently. And finally being given a kick up the arse by the school and learning how to read. 

I remember being given ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" for Christmas in a big blue hardbound edition by my grandparents, when I was 7 years and 4 days, and it was the first book I ever read. God this is sounding like a pile of mush, but it was the book that really showed me to love reading. 

I think I've always had a totally overactive imagination. I always was, and still am, making up entire worlds, writing long stories in my head. And I remember reading that book, and it was a whole other world to explore. 

I guess the Narnia books, really, were the books of my childhood. To complete the schmaltz in the story I should probably say something about how they were my only friends when everyone else teased me at school or something, but that's total bollocks. I loved school and my friends. But I loved, and still love, the ability to go and live in different worlds, including those other people write, stepping in their shoes, just for a bit. I guess it's sort of a (to paraphrase) ""This is my world, tell me yours"" (sorry Manics) And I guess you have to be nostalgic about the first time you remember doing that, and how much of what you are has come from it all. 

So you know, I can accept they're not the most amazing works of literature ever, they shove christian allegory in your face (I must have been the only person age 18 to have still missed the Aslan/Jesus thing before someone told me), and the film yes, was incredibly cheesy and certainly had it's faults. But my word, did seeing affect me. It was the really random bits though - not the big weepy scenes or anything, but the first time we get a shot of Cair Paravel, meeting Father Christmas, Peter just about vomming after killing Morgrim, and trying his best to look after his siblings, and Aslan roaring as he takes off with Lucy and Susan on his back. Because it pretty much was the world I used to dream about, right there."

1. Dragon Wonderful. Felt the whole cinema wince every time it went DragonSmash!
2. Hermione still annoys me.
3. Ron's robes wonderful.
4. Ralph Fiennes very interesting choice, thought it worked well. 
5. Thankyou makers of film for the eye candy that was Diggory and Krum.

On exiting the cinema: 

(Female) Housemate 1: ""So which one would you choose?""
(Male) Housemate 2: Well, I think the third film was...
Me: Krum in Uniform, Diggory otherwise.
Housemate 1: Yeah, I'd go for Diggory as well. In a sort of floppy haired, wholesome way.
Housemate 2: ???
Me: True, you'd sort of want him as your nice and reliable, and Krum would blatantly be such a chauvinist.
Housemate 1: Yeah, but on the other hand, Krum would so be the better shag, because Diggory would be such an inept public schoolboy about the whole thing whilst Krum would be all Grrr Alpha-Male...
Housemate 2: Hello Fictional Characters? Fictional and 5 years younger than you characters?
Me: *ahem* *studiously not mentioning fandom...*

There is only one thing in criket and that is the STRATE BAT. Keep yore bat strate boy and all will be all right in life as in criket. So headmasters sa, but when my bat is strate i still get bowled is that an omen chiz. Aktually i usually prefer to hav a slosh: i get bowled just the same but it is more satisfactory.

For the reason that it is extremely dificult to hit the ball with a STRATE BAT or not criket matches are a bit of a strane. When you are a new bug or a junior in the 3rd game it is all right becos then you can sit around the boundary and keep the score in a notebook. When you get tired with that which is about 3 minits you can begin to tuough up your frendes and neighbours who look so sweet and angelic in their clean white criket shirts hem-hem. This is super. You look up enuff to sa Good shot, grabber or Couldn't hit a squashed tomato, and then back to the fray.

But it is a funy thing when you grow biger you always get into a criket team you canot avoid it chiz. Tremble tremble you arive and see the pitch which is 2388 miles approx from the pavilion. Captain win toss and choose to bat chiz chiz chiz chiz. Moan drone tremble tremble you sit with white face and with everybode's knees knocking together it sound like a coconut shy. Wot is the pleasure of it eh i would like to kno. Give me a thumbscrew or slo fire every time.

When your turn come the folowing things can hapen
(A) You loose your bat.
(B) You fante dead away.
(C) Your trousis fall down.
(D) You trip over your shoe laces.

Captain then come up to you and sa BLOCK EVERYTHING molesworth and do not slosh we need 6 to win. When he sa this all the things above hapen all at once. They revive you with a buket of water and drive you out to the wicket. This is not as you guessed 2398 miles away it is 6000 now and they hav men with gats covering all the exits so you canot run away.

At the wicket

Of course it is the fast blower you hav to face he is waiting there at the other end of the pitch looking very ferce. Umpire is v. kind he can aford to be he hav not got to bat. He sa
We are very pleesed to see you do make yourself at home. Of course you would like guard what guard would you like us to give you?
Squeak.
Come agane?
Squeak squeak.

Ohyes.

Flintoff sums it up: ""The strength of this side is that people stick their hand up at different times""  whenever a performance was needed, there were enough outstanding and inspiring players that someone would stand up and be counted. Harmy and KP at Lords to show we weren't going to lie down. Tres and Freddie at Edgebaston, Jones and Vaughan at Old Trafford, Hoggy and Flintoff again at Trent Bridge, and Freddie and Hoggy and then of course KP at the Oval. Awesome."

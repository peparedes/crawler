I've noticed that i have a much more heightened sense of smell during this time and someone somewhere is boiling a chicken, infused with lemon.<br /><br />Also one of my favourite websites, <a href=""http://www.newgrounds.com"">www.newgrounds.com</a> is currently down - which sucks because I love watching flash toons.&nbsp; I know there are plenty of sites around like <a href=""http://www.fat-pie.com"">www.fat-pie.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.weebls-stuff.com"">www.weebls-stuff.com</a> but they haven't got anything that i haven't already seen - i need at least one fix a day of new toons!!&nbsp;<br /><br />I suppose in hindsight i should have named this entry ""I want my toons"". But I didn't cos I can smell chicken.<br /><br />That aside, the reason I went to the newgrounds website today was because there is an awesome flash toon called ""smile"", it's been described as both ""Orwellian"" and ""Goth"". I can't remember the official website of the guy who created this toon - but I found it last time and he's created another toon which i adored about this guy who loses his fiance and...well i won't spoil it for you but it's very dark.<br /><br />It's been a while since I last wrote something good in this blog - I think all my bowie friends have given up on me (long live the area).<br /><br />I'm trying to find some new bowie images for my bowie wall at work. I've just not gotten round to it yet, I'll probably build up a little collection of favourites before i commit to cellotape.<br /><br />I've also noticed lately that the world is a very wierd place - the other day i was on the bus and this horrible pig fingered my back up and down - i shot out of my seat, got off the bus and took the next bus that came along - which then proceeded to overtake the yukkee bus i was on and so i got home early :) that for me was actually a good day afterall. (apart from the creepy man who fingered my back bit).<br /><br /><br /><br />"

David Bowie goes down to The Arts Lab at The Three Tuns pub, with a huge alligator on a leash. He walks over to the bar, and orders a beer. The bartender says ""Sorry sir. You can't bring that alligator in here! It's a dangerous animal, and you're scaring all of the patrons!"" Sure enough. David looked around and noticed that everyone was standing on the tables, looking very nervous. ""But wait!"" he cried. ""This alligator is tame. It wouldn't hurt anyone.""

However, the bartender is adamant. David continues, ""If I can prove that this alligator is not vicious, can he stay?"" ""Well, I guess so,"" says the bartender, ""however, you're going to have a devil of a time proving to everyone here that your alligator is tame!""

David smiles, and leans over the alligator. ""Ralph!"" he shouts. ""Sit up."" With that, he beats the alligator on the head with his fist. BANG. BANG. BANG. And the alligator rears up on its tail. ""Ralph, open your mouth."" BANG. BANG. BANG.

And the alligator opened its huge mouth wide, revealing row upon row of gleaming white teeth. David pulls out his wanger, and lays it in the alligator's mouth, as the entire bar crowd gasps. ""Ralph! Close your mouth, but don't bite."" BANG. BANG. BANG.

As David pummels the alligator on the head, the giant mouth slowly closes, and stops just short of biting David's dick off. The crowd sighs, and David says, ""Ralph, open your mouth."" BANG. BANG. BANG. The alligator's mouth opens wide again.

""There,"" says David to the crowd. ""Now would anyone else like to try this?"" A blonde in the back says, ""Yeah, I'll try. But only if your promise not to hit me on the head so hard."""

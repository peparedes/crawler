"event","Jonathan McCourt was a minor figure in my teenage-hood but quite a memorable one nonetheless.  He would help out with the youth group at church and he was always bright and incredibly funny.  Everyone loved him and his wife so much.  He was close to my parents' age.  He was very religious without being fake.  This I can respect even if the views were different from my own.  Practicing what one preaches these days is so rare.  

My church organization always took a very critical stand on mental health.  One is only mentally unhealthy if one isn't a good ""Christian"" and one chooses to be mentally unhealthy.  Jonathan McCourt was one of the truest, good Christians I have ever met and he became mentally unhealthy.  Eat that GARBC.  Jonathan McCourt will remain a childhood hero to me for all time.  One of the few people I could truly respect.  It was sad how it all ended.  

A brief synopsis of what occurred:
Jonathan took his new truck downtown to the courthouse (out of character to have a new truck because he was very thrifty) and began to spray paint raical slurs, obscenities and the words ""Police Academy 7.""  A sheriff's deputy approached and Jonathan began swearing and using racial slurs (very out of character since he was so devoutly religous).  The deputy tried to arrest him and Jonathan ran.  Deputy chased and Jonathan jumped on top of his truck.  The deputy attempted to subdue him and Jonathan began spray painting him then reached for his belt.  The deputy assumed Jonathan had a gun.  He shot Jonathan in the stomach.  Jonathan later died.  There are conflicting details about whether Jonathan had a toy gun which supposedly looked nothing like a real gun or no gun at all.  A grand jury inquiry is being held.  

Prior to this event Jonathan had been exhibiting very odd behavior repeatedly.  There was a warrant for his arrest out to commit him to a mental hospital.  My question is why was he so hard to find?  How did things get this far?  He was a member of a church but had been kicked out due to his ranting and raving.  I am just amazed that someone somewhere could not intervene.  BTW the deputy shot someone else last year.

I think of the situation with restraining orders.  The only protection a person has from a threatening individual is a restraining order.  The restrained person has to commit an act or verbalize a threat and you have to prove such an act occurred.  In my case my ex.  So my ex violated my rights so I have to go get a restraining order to stop him from doing so.  I then have to pay someone to track him down and serve him in person.  If I can find him to have him served then I have to battle him in court.  He can say whatever he wants about me and try to get me to act like an idiot in hopes of getting this order dismissed.  Further violation of my rights not to be harrassed.  He can call the FBI and file false reports and they do nothing.  If he decides he wants to bother me he still can.  He can drive over to my house and I have to prove he drove over to my house.  He can email me using a fake name and I have to prove it was him.  He can call and hang up from a pay phone and I have to prove it was him.  He can come over and murder me and my kids in our sleep or even threaten it and I have nothing I can do.  Where is prevention?  Why do we have to put up with this?  Because he has rights, too.  Because mentally ill people like Jonathan have a right to flip out and do something incredibly nutso so some trigger-happy deputy can shoot him.  America is the land of the free...  We are all free to drive someone else crazy.

Look at smoking...  Used to be only men could smoke.  Then we all could smoke and did so freely.  We drove nonsmokers nuts with the stench and the smoke.  Then we werent supposed to expose kids to it.  Now it is more like a stigma to smoke so The rights of the nonsmokers matter more.  There is no such thing as freedom in a pure and true sense.  You cannot grant everyone absolute pure freedom.  America is the land of the relatively free and don't get me started on the home of the brave part...  That is another day.  

Stepping off my soapbox now...  Night all :)"

"event","Ok, so yesterday I was at work when I realized I had court at 130.  Yikes!!!  So I tell my super and take off about 1230, go home and change and grab my massive notebook of Mark-related stuff.  I make it there with 2 minutes to spare.  Judge calls me and says he can't really do anything with Mark not present.  I was like well ya'll do plenty with me not present!!!  No notification of hearings and so on to boot.  He was like sorry, ma'am but it isn't fair to your ex.  He is the one who caused all this so why should I care?  Anyway... GRRRR one day it will be all over.  Good thing is the restraining order IS still in effect.  So he must leave me alone.

I called my current school and it does not appear to be too much effort to get into grad school.  Kinda scary since I have felt all along that my education was pretty lame.  I guess if I get the paper that gets me the job that is what matters.  I know I tend to be a little more with it than alot of my classmates-well, most days, anyway.  LOL  Somedays I do a marvelous job of proving exactly just how much of a moron I can be.  I could have my master's this time in 2008 if I play my cards right. Not bad since I am still working on my bachelor's.

I am so fricking sick of foreigners contacting me.  I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY YOU!!!  I AM NOT GIVING YOU MONEY!!!  I AM NOT YOUR TICKET TO AMERICA!!!  GO AWAY!!!  Sorry I know this is one reason why we Americans have the reputation we do.  Why do foreigners not understand marrying an American just to get into America is morally wrong.  I am not a tool.  It is insulting and I am not stupid.  I have yet to date an American black guy so that is my next adventure if I stray outside my past dating experience.  I was raised in small town Iowa surrounded by white, church-going morons.  I have done a great deal to stretch my boundaries but I am not about to stretch them so far as to chance dealing with a foreigner after a green card.  Thanks but no thanks.  NOTE TO YAHOO:  Thanks for the spam button now how about a ""foreigners asking for money or marriage"" button?  

Anyway late for work..."

Now, my good friend has just got his doctorate and turned his affections towards me.  He is cute, can be very sweet, fun to talk with, and so on, but I just don't need this.  I am not at a point in my life where I can deal with something like this.  Plus, I think he has idealized me in his failed attempts with other women.  He never wanted kids and I have an plethora of them.  He said, ""well, my sister has four kids and she does just fine with them.""  Well, I have four kids and my life is sheer chaos 24-7-365.  True I only have two with me at a time but still ""think pandemonium...""  He is organized, anal, tends to be a little self-centered, judgmental, AND he is assuming I want this.  This trip he is making to see me began in my mind and remained until recently when he began with the ""I miss you"" comments, a vacation.  For him, not me.  I was a little irritated because I have so much going on and he was like ""we need to do this, too...""  Well, YOU can do that but I have work, kids, school, housing program issues, etc.  SIGH...  I do not want to alienate him but if a relationship is what he wants with me, most likely it won't happen.  I am in CO and he is in MN.  I need calm, easy-going, laid-back, compassionate, understanding, patient, etc.  All the things he isn't.  It isn't so much that he is a big extreme of those things but he is enough of them to make a relationship near impossible.  I also need time and space to develop a relationship with someone.

"event","Ok My life has officially sucked for about 2 years straight now.  This has to be a record for me.  I am used to a general theme of suckiness-lots of it because I am an idiot.  This is getting to be ridiculous, however.  I am at the point here where either it or I am going to break down.  I can only be this strong for this long.  I have no real friends right now.  The last one I had went behind my back and was trying to get with the last guy I was with.  Then grinningly admits it and says sorry like this makes it all better.  In the big picture it really isn't that big a deal since I don't want him but the idea that she didn't even ask and was sneaking around...  And this isn't the first time she and I have had issues.  Have you ever played a game where you get distracted and make stupid mistakes that haunt you the rest of the game and you never really are able to overcome those mistakes?  That is what is going on now.  It is frustrating as hell, too.  I am like ""why God do we have to keep kicking me in the ass when I got what the deal is already?""  I suppose the very definition of life should include it sucks, it isn't fair, and you better learn to just deal.  But when you go to bed more nights than night wanting to just cry yourself to sleep...  I am not a bad person.  I am a person who trusts the wrong people too easily, makes emotionally-based decisions, and suffers the consequences.  I am trying to change the things I see that are wrong but I keep finding more things to either change or ""tweak.""  All of these things after something goes wrong.  I guess the big thing stressing me is...  money.  I am finally recovering from hurricane Mark and the housing agency wants to up my rent by about 210 a month and that is based on money I dont even get all the time.  Also I am about at the breaking point financially as well.  The thing also is, if I get a better job or more hours, they take 30% of the increase in income as well.  Hey, if I could pay all my bills and break even at end of month, I would pay without complaint.  My complaint is I don't have any extravagances in my life and this is what I get to deal with.  Who am I going to pay this month and who am I not just so my little world doesnt collapse?  My boss keeps promising more hours.  They are coming in little by little but I need to be back to full time to make this work.  SO I am thinking lately, trying Progressive since they pay a little better but the hours totally suck.  I would end up sending T back home which might not be a bad thing and keeping Alex but paying butt tons for daycare.  Maybe do both Progressive and dental lab.  Then there is the issue of no social life for either me nor Alex.  Plus who says I would get the Progressive job?  Things are just not working here.  It is tempting to just pack up what I can, leave the rest, and go home.  I am not even sure that is an option but it is one I curl up with when I am crying at night.  I am so tired of being lonely, working so hard, getting nowhere, and feeling desperate.  I am so close to being done with my degree if I can just manage everything for a little while longer, I can just work and collapse in exhaustion.  I know the dental lab job is going to have to go.  I need predictable income more than any of the rest of them there and I am the last to get it.  That job is part of the reason I am in this mess.  I think Progressive might be an answer or something like that anyway.  I should check into doing what Ron does even though it would suck.  Anyway, T left a big mess in the kitchen so I had better get to that and my tummy is gurgly again.  I quit that med about 3 weeks ago and I am still having gurgly tummy.  It has been a month since my digestive tract ran normal a least.  God, please just give me a break, a little sunshine, some hope?  I will be eternally grateful...  I didn't even go into the Mark thing."

What if we could make cyborgs so very real it would be hard to tell the difference?  We could match humans up with a cyborg each, specifically designed to be their partner.  We could control pregnancy, domestic violence, depression, and more.  The single mother epidemic and associated problems with this occurence would be gone.  I am thinking this could be the best thing ever.  The cyborg wouldn't hate you because you are too fat, too short, bald, quiet, loud, etc.  The personality could be based on a well adjusted human that would be a good match for whomever the cyborg is made for.  Just think, ladies, no problems with finding Mr. Psycho or Mr. I cant get it up or Mr. I want it every second of the day or i am gonna cheat and so on.  I know this isnt a novel idea for the world but it is the first time I truly considered the societal implications.  and personal...  I like the idea."

I called the courthouse to verify the next anulment hearing and the clerk got rude-politely so, but rude nonetheless.  ""Ma'am, I am a setting clerk, how am I supposed to know that?""  I was like ""How am I supposed to know what you know and what you don't?""  I don't make a habit of hanging out in courthouses unlike my ex.  I have no idea what a setting clerk does anymore than a setting clerk knows what a dental lab tech does.  Grrr.  I think I was raised wrong or something.  I expect people to be more polite than they ever are.

Anyway, it was kinda sprinkly and the rain was moving through the mountains.  I started feeling all sad.  I just want to watch the storms move through the mtns while snuggling with someone I love.  I think there is something about this place that changes people.  Maybe I don't fit in here because I havent changed yet.  Maybe I can't, maybe I dont want to.  They are politely rude all over here.  It's an epidemic.  Noone really cares.  It's like, ""sheesh, I see ya laying on the ground dying there...  Sure hope everything works out for ya.""  I was thinking lately, I may just go ahead and move back east.  Not sure where or how.  I need to get my truck paid off and save up some money first, though.  I am thinking if I can't get my ex out here, then Omaha would be an ok compromise.  I cannot in any way pull off Mpls, nor do I think I wanna with Alex's family there.  Not sure how I can pull off any location but Omaha, I think, might be a little easier.  If Jenny is willing to move there then why not?  Seems to me God is saying I don't belong here anyway.  

Back to the ""snuggling with someone I love"" thing...  I seem to find men who wanna snuggle and watch the storms.  They aren't the least bit concerned, though, with love.  They might even try to get involved with me.  They may even say they love me.  But it is this shallow, meaningless thing based on sex and not-aloneness.  They might say they want a best friend for a lover but the minute you start talking they need to get going.  Then when you lose interest and move on, they are like ""what the hell happened?""  I so need to become a lesbian, I think.  If only I could get over yacking at the thought of doing the things men want to do to me to another woman.  EW... Ok, I need to find something else to do..."

My friends are coming over Friday evening for cards-oh, ok but they have to be gone by 8, I have an early class Saturday.  Honey, I want to hang this hideous picture my Aunt Flora painted for me right here-and ruin the entire look and feel of the living room?  I truly miss having someone.  I do not miss these kinds of things.  I cannot imagine ever living with someone long term again.  They would have to be so easy going and just let me do my thing, or we would have to have our own areas of the house and he couldn't be jealous of my dog.  *sigh*  Of course, I say all that in light of the famine that is occuring in my online dating life.  I finally talked to B last night and it really sounded as if he was insinuating that he wasnt interested in dating me.  He was interested in having me for a ""sex friend.""  All implied, nothing outright, of course.  I was like, ""Good fucking LORD!!!""  I then told him thanks but no thanks-all implied but nothing outright.  I don't understand why I am always the back-up plan for the desperate ones, always the mistress for the cheaters, always the friend with bennies for the average man, always the confidante with bennies of the broken ones.  Either I have one big, massive ego or these guys are missing something.  Maybe I am destined to be alone or used.  Why this is so boggles me.  I have this friend coming to see me.  We kinda had a thing in MN.  He just got his Phd in Philosophy.  We have kept in touch over the years.  I was always a little confused as to why.  I mean we had great conversation, chemistry, etc.  He made it clear when we were together that I wasnt someone he would settle with.  He doesn't like kids for one.  OK...  So why come see me while I live in this tiny little apt with kids?  Sex?  is it that hard to have sex in MN?  Looking to start something? Still have the kids...  Bored?  Well I am kinda in the middle of rebuilding my life here.  I guess I will just deal with it as it comes.  Men are weird.  I am sick of sniveling though to try to get one to be interested.  My attitude now is ""this is me, what I want, and what I need to do, if you cant deal then get the fuck out of my life.""

Then asks more questions.  I am vague.  He doesn't really ask anything other than what type of guy are you looking for?  I respond to that question vaguely.  Again I ask why dont we im.  He says ok this evening.  Then he asks about meeting me for lunch.  I said no I dont take lunch breaks.  Then I get home from class yesterday and he sends me this...

Wendy:
 
Actually I would have had to withdraw my invitation. Due to my level of security clearance and the type of computer work I do and for who, I am required to report people I want to date to my employer. I just found out a few minutes ago in a phone call to me the name you are using on line is not your current real name, and that you are married. A minor detail you did not be honest with me about that in the eyes of my employer makes us communicating with each other unethical and a security risk to me. The Loss Prevention team verified this fact of you being married in a phone call to the Courthouse. They did confirm you are ""Wendy"" nevertheless. I was completey shocked when they told me this. I was not expecting that from you. Listen, I shared with you my sad story of what happened in my marriage, maybe you will have better luck than I did or turn things around, divorces don't have to happen.
 
I am sorry. We must end our communications, so please do not reply. Best of luck to you in your dreams shared.

Huh?  So this will be going with me to court tomorrow.  Hopefully things will be finally over.  This guy is a lunatic.  What if I had said, ""ok, let's meet for lunch""?  I am scared that he would have met me and then things would have gone very wrong, very quickly.  I decided this am to call the police.  As my exhusband's favorite saying goes, ""Don't go away mad, Mark, just go away.""  What good is all this doing you?  To prove your power?  Yeah, ok, you proved it in our less than 2 month marriage which you conned me into.  To scare me?  I think the liking to scare people thing makes ya feel powerful and you did that in marriage and prior.  You threatened me, my kids, my friends, and my family.  Ok, so you were successful at destroying me as punishment for imagined crimes and for not begging you back.  What could I possibly have left that you are still aiming for?  You want me back?  Get professional help and even then I am so scared of you I doubt I could try again.  You are smooth and will do anything to have things your way.  You dont want just me.  You want me completely under your control.  A little puppet because you know you are not man enough to be a normal partner to anyone.  I see you naked now, Mark, stripped of your handsome exterior, your pseudo-charm, your games, your crocodile tears.  Please, there are plenty of other women out there go find one of them to harrass and control.  I just want a simple life with someone to love and someone to love me.  That is one thing you can't manufacture or fake and you arent capable of producing it for real.  So just move on..."

"event","Update on Christopher Robbinson.  He has me blocked on yahoo.  I don't know what I did but whatever.  It just seems rude with all the time I spent listening to him whine about his ex and his life and money and so on.  I don't understand what all the talk was about he and I being a thing further on down the road was either.  Honesty is a priceless quality.  Funny I was thinking about him for a few yesterday and I offhandedly had a thought about how I didn't trust him.  It kinda caught me off-guard and I was like ""of course I trust him-or do I?""  This is for the best.  He drinks too much, smokes too much, is on the edge emotionally and mentally, doesn't like kids come to find out, and there is a hundred other reasons, too.  I had hoped to befriend him and Bud.  I guess I am not cool enough for them-they are so concerned with the right clothes, right people, right things to do, say, like, have been, etc.  That's just too much work.  I want to be the best me rather than worry about those things.  I am a true philosopher then I guess according to what we discussed in class yesterday."

"event","Little stressed today.  Money issues.  A stable income sure as hell would be nice.  I can't make any plans or do anything but wait for the next famine.  Sigh.... But things should get better.  Alex will be old enough for boys and girls club soon, be in school all day which will save me a small fortune.  Then I can crank up my hours more.  Jenny should be down here, too, which can be a huge help.  Just from a psychological standpoint it can help if nothing else.  (pardon my sentence fragments here)  Then I can start building a savings acct for real, maybe look at investing, too.  I need to work on that aspect seriously.  Learn to live on what I am making and save for when it is a bit less, work on investing to build wealth, finish at least master's degree, look for work in my field, maybe do lab work part time, buy a house, buy my dog, in time get that doctorate.  The big thing I hate about my financial habits is when I get leftover money or a big check I think, ""how can I spend this?""  I want to rewire me so I think ""how can I best impact my life positively with this?""  Usually that answer would be to save it or invest it or pay something off.  Major habit change there, Wendy.  Atleast with Mr. Spend other people's money Man gone it will get easier to do somehting right.  I really need to plan my life more than I have been.  Little Miss Impulsive lately.  Need a big calendar with objectives listed on it.  Maybe make a daily sheet.  Yeah daily sheet sounds good.  I will try that.  thanks, journal.... :)"

"event","I really dont know what to think.  I found out tonight that Chris is sleeping with a skank with the intention of being with me later.  Skank gets to be rebound girl, I get to be put on layaway.  I don't know how to feel about this.  I guess it means I am the winner but of what?  God, what do I think about all this?  I think if he even has it in him to use other people, no matter how right things seem to be when we are together, I don't want him.  I also understand how ex's can screw you up.  Then there is Mike.  Don't even get me started on Mike...  More on this eve at a later date."

"event","When I was about 13 or so I sat down and realized that I didn't like who I was turning into.  So I thought about who I wanted to be.  I then became that person.  It worked very well.  I am kinda thinking I need to do that again.  I have not handled this Chris situation very well at all.  Honestly, he has been a way huge distraction more than the others.  I don't understand it either.  At least now it is over and I am not sure whether to feel relieved or sad.  I still find my mind drifting when I am trying to read homework.  I feel so very alone right now which is the worst part.  I have no friends to go visit or hang out with, no family.  I also don't really want to since I would most likely just obsess about Chris which I am really trying not to do.  I just want to find a nice decent guy with a little patience.  I want to be free to develop feelings and vice versa.  I want to know when we sleep together it is monogamous.  I want to know if he wants to go out it is with me and when he wants to stay in he wants to cuddle with me.  I want to know when I need space that he can be ok with that and he will be patient with me if I initially get a little weird about his space.  I want a friend first and lover next.  I had hoped for that with Chris but he is still very clearly in a ""it's all about me"" mode.  Understandable in his case but not right for me.  I need some give and take.  My gut instinct is to panic right now but reminding myself that when I end up without anyone to chat with someone else ALWAYS comes along.  Who knows? maybe next time it will be right.  There is still slim hope for Chris.  
     The point, however, is I have a hard enough time handling my life as is.  I DO NOT need someone who will just drag me down, out, up, away from things I must do.  The grey in my life I find overwhelming."

"event","I really need to work on me.  There are some things that really aren't working and I am tired of them not working.  One is I need to figure out how to have a social life that isn't centered on getting a boyfriend.  I also need to not drop everything once it seems like there is a boyfriend on the horizon and just focus on chasing him.  I need to take care of my life then add the extra stuff.  I know with Chris, I am like this eager little puppy just waiting by the computer for a scrap of attention and if it seems like he has been gone too long, I am depressed and suspicious.  The trick here is to find balance.  He likes lots of attention, needs his freedom, and I tend to smother or drop and run.  I guess my goal is to develop friends with females where there is healthy give and take and maintain Chris and I without diving in 100% and ruining it by all my insecurities.  Sigh, what a job I have.  I am uncertain how to do it.  Maybe need to look at signing up for therapy somehow.  It's sad when one has no idea how to be friends.  Also sad when I like Chris so much, have to hold back, and I don't know how it will turn out which drives me crazy.  I know, Wendy, deal, it's life and love.  The way things go...  

I go thursday to find out exactly how much I have left to get my degree.  Upon successful completion of these two classes I believe it is 6 classes I have left.  Will let you know.  Then I need to get on the stick about applying for grad school.  I am scared.  of what?  why?  That is the thing... NOTHING.  I am like this.  ok I had better get ready for work.  Missed Chris' good morning this morning.  I need a life."

I decided to stop because I was saying things knowing Chris was reading them not because it was what I wanted to say.  I was being prety stupid, too.  I am not handling this whole ""back the fuck off, Wendy,"" thing we have going.  We spend HOURS daily talking and so on.  This is ok but the sex is not.  Rolling my eyes here...

"event","As if my meet up with ex's daughter bringing up nauseating feelings of I can't deal with this wasn't enough and then Greenie's patronizing apologetic online reunion wasn't enough, I had a talk wth Chris today about slowing down sexually.  I don't know that I really understand how things are between he and I.  I agreed to meet him this evening at Darkside.  I went and initially it was ok but then he kinda just went off and ignored me.  (pardon my run-on sentences here...)  So I went to find him to tell him I wanted to leave.  He then said well when I get alcohol in me I become Mr Butterfly.  Bullshit, he hangs all over me.  Not this evening did he.  So then he says we should do coffee as that would be ""more, you know, productive for you and I.""  Whatever that means.  It felt like all night he was pushing Bud and I together and that pissed me off.  I want Chris.  If not Chris then I pick out my own person.  Grrrr. Jamming to tool tonight, of course.  I don't know if he meant that I shouldn't hang with him anymore at Darkside.  I just don't know-prolly reading WAAYYY too much into it.  I am going to bed."

I am afraid I do not see the attraction, but it's your choice. When you described some of the people where you hang out, it sounds like a bunch of rebellious teenagers rather than young to middle aged adults. Second childhood??? Whatever tickles your funnybone.

Well, considering I never had a first childhood...

When a guy gets to know you, he finds a great catch<br>
Problem is... you're too shy for most guys to get to know.<br>
From meeting someone to dating, you usually have your guard up.<br>
And while you're just holding back, it makes you seem like you've got something to hide.

"event","Friday evening I went to Darkside with Eric and met Chris and Bud there.  I found out Chris had recently slept with someone when he had told me he hadnt.  Not a huge deal except it made me a little nervous about being played games with.  I took two mental steps back and said, ""ok, two can play this game.""  Then thought no, I am better than this, he goes to friend status period.  I don't need to reinforce the stereotype of women being manipulative.  It is what it is.  Even if I hadnt found out that bit, he very well could be behaving that way anyway and I need to be careful trusting regardless.  He later admitted he was jealous of Eric talking with me and then when Eric grabbed me around my waist.  He also told me he told his family about me.  That seems to say he really is leaning towards this being a something.  I hate this stumbling in the dark part.  I really like him and it really scares me.  Doesn't it always? Maybe he isn't just a friend already technically.

So Friday was a blast.  I wanted more Saturday but Chris crapped out on me.  Fatigue and family needs.  So Eric and I went out.

We went to Darkside and saw some heavy band.  I wasnt terribly into them but lead singer was fun to watch and cute.  So we left after they finished up and headed over to Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I saw my former stepdaughter-the daughter of THE great love of my life-and it shook me pretty badly especially when I saw a pic of my ex flashed on the screen.  So I won't be going there again.  Think he has been hanging out there.  I just want to move on.  I never wanted to make an exit so fast in my entire life.

This am Greenie pops online.  He moved to the middle east.  Thanks Greenie for the respect of standing me up on our date to ""move to the middle east.""  Fucking fuckhead, go get yourself fucked but I am not bitter."

"event","I had an ok day after feeling worthless yesterday.  I don't know why I find it so hard some days to just be an adult.  I guess spending way too much time grieving for my lack of a childhood and my inability to fullfil my desire to have one now.  I also have this impulse thing I have to fight.  I go for a long time fighting the impulses, then one hits, and I am like, ""well, I have been so good for so long...""  I also feel like finally I found someone to run with that I can't keep up with because I have to behave.  It sucks.  Wild girl will have to wait til she is too old to be wild.  

Funny how so many people misunderstand me.  They see me and think they get what it is all about.  ""Bad girl"", ""that woman"", ""bitch"" and more.  Funny how sometimes when I write or type it feels like I am playing piano.  Listening to music helps me open up and flow.  Typing in rhythm to the music and my soul.  I am a rock hard sex veneer that covers the soft silk of a girl inside that longs to fly  Staring from inside mirrored glass I know what I must do  I know what I am saving from myself  Somedays feel like a caterpillar inside and working on opening up soon to take the world by storm if I ever find my wings.  I just wrote that in seconds while listening to Tori Amos ""sleeps with butterflies""  I keep thinking I need to collect a soundtrack to my life.  This song would be mine to Chris.  I find often I want more but am so very content with giving space and just knowing him.  If it is meant to be in time it will be and be so much more for the wait. I just wish I could write like Tori and Maynard and heck, even my friend, Jeff.  Now there is a topic for another day-Jeff. 

Sleeps With Butterflies

airplanes 
take you away again
are you flying above where we live
then i look up, a glare in my eyes
are you having regrets about last night
i'm not, but i like rivers that
rush in 
so then i dove in
is there trouble ahead for you, the acrobat
i won't push you, unless you have a net

you say the word you know i will find you
or if you need some time i don't mind
i don't hold on to the tail of your kite
i'm not like the girls that you've known
but i believe i'm worth coming home to
kiss away night
this girl only sleeps with butterflies
with butterflies
so go on and fly then, boy

balloons look good from on the ground
i fear with pins and needles around
we may fall then stumble upon a carousel
it could take us anywhere

you say the word you know i will find you
or if you need some time i don't mind
i don't hold on to the tail of your kite
i'm not like the girls that you've known
but i believe i'm worth coming home to
kiss her, waiting by this girl
this girl

you say the word you know i will find you

"event","My children are very negative.  I can only assume they must get this from me.  I know if I am depressed the negative comes fast and hard.  I fight against it though all the time.  I really work on the cognitve restructuring.  I truly believe it works.  I didn't think I projected the negativity though.  I thought I pretty much kept that all inside me.  Well, they are picking up on it somehow.  Lots of times, I find lack of sleep to be the primary culprit of the depression/negativity getting the upper hand.  I do not stay up late often to account for the depression sleep issue.  It is rare actually that I am up after 10 and usually down by 9 and I sleep til about 6:30 or 7.  I prefer 7 but for the kids to get to school on time 6:30 seems to work better.  Today, for example, I am exhausted.  I was depressed yesterday and I hadn't been up late recently.  I think as much as I like chatting with Chris, I really need to get to bed earlier.  I have so much I need to do and depression isn't going to make it any easier.  The bad thing is, I am looking at taking a part time job.  I really hope Jenny moves soon.  I think if I can get her to help out with kids so I can work, I can get some bills out of the way.  Life will be so much easier then.  Really need to restock my savings, though.  I kinda think that is a priority right now.  I pay the one bill causing me grief, build my savings, and then get lesser bills out of the way.  Now to decide how much I should have in reserve...  Obviously, 500 in case of another accident, 350 in case I lose my job so I don't lose my truck, 170 for insurance in case I lose my job, I am required to give two weeks notice to day care I think so should have two weeks' worth of daycare saved up (80) or is it a month notice (160), I pay rent one month behind so 300 currently, and my tags which I always forget were 140 this year.  I cannot think of anything else.  That adds up to 1380 which I should make sure I always have that sitting around.  I also think I should save for sales on clothing, food, prolly should have money saved up in case my computer craps out since that is a necessity for school.  I also want to save for a house and should plan on saving for emergency doc visits.  I am thinking I should have around 3000 at all times just sitting.  If I want a house I am looking at another probably 4000 I should save.  I am trying to figure out guidelines to live by so I can avoid issues as much as possible.  I can't believe how it feels like I am having to be my own mother.  Things I should have learned when I was young I am learning the hard way now.  I have fallen into some terrible habits that I am fighting to break.  I think while at work today, I will work on listing things I do that cause me so much grief and work on guidelines for those things.  It doesnt help I have such horrid luck or is it karma?  I wonder what I am doing or have done to cause the need for such karma?  At any rate...  yaaawwwwnnnnnnn....  Thank God Friday is around the corner."

I know I am well-entrenched in my Tool/APC rut.  Sorry, folks.  Wallowing in my boo hooey.  

Chris was saying my super's daughter was bad-mouthing me which leaves me curious why.  Never been anything but nice to her.  Super and her kids are weird, though.  Oh well.  Still bangs on the Paul-induced dent in my self-esteem and that's a pretty ouchy one.  I know I am not your run-of-the-mill anything.

Decided to be brave and ask Chris to go bounce around in the mtns with me.  Well drive in a vehicle with kids in the back.  Not the kind of bounce around I wanna do with him.... ANYWAY...  I ended up flipping my truck on its side.  Yes, folks, I did this.  With the guy I really like even more than I ever liked Greenie.  I am blowing it left and right.  ""SHE SAID...""  and I ain't even getting a ""Thank you, ma'am..."" for it.  Shit.  Let's recap my history with Mr. Christopher P...  He is divorcing quite painfully.  We talk.  He likes me, we meet and we brign our kids.  Alex talks non-stop the entire night.  Chris claims to be enchanted.  Yeah right, buying that and some cellulite cream.  Next time we meet we meet at a punk/goth bar.  I am dressed to seduce and it musta worked.  He is verbally all over me but isn't drunk enough to ""go there.""  Chat, chat, chat.  Meet again, same bat place, same bat time, different bat day.  Bringing with me Mr. G. Billy Toby Bob and the two play chest thumpies over me.  Testosterone sucks.  Good thing I love what gender it causes.  Anyway, of course we all know who wins and is in my bed by the end of the evening or should I say morning?  So we are both exhausted over next couple days and he is worried he isnt any good.  I get strep throat and am on my back for half the next week ( and for no good reason :))  And I end this up with a grand finale of flipping my truck.  Yes, taking my bow now.  Thank you, thank you.  AND For my encore...  I am going to bed alone to sleep.  :)"

"event","Hmm... becoming a habit to abandon my journal and then play catch up.  Don't like that.  Sorry to all (well, one) of my loyal fans.  What have I been up to?  Well, of course there's the never-ending clean up in the wake of Hurricane Mark, there is going out to Darkside, getting my lip pierced, and sick with strep throat.  Now those of you who don't remember what strep throat is like... Think about one of those copper bristled grill cleaners, now ram that fucker down your throat for about half an hour, add all kinds of goo in every orifice on your head, a nice fever, extreme fatigue, and to top it all off this really ishy taste in your mouth that only momentarily disappears with a thorough tooth-brushing and Listerine gargling.  This, my friends, is the joy of strep throat, courtesy of my son, Alex.  
I think I mentioned Greenie has disappeared.  I decided to not care what happened since he obviously was only interested in a certain activity we occasionally engaged in.  I have since seen a couple other people.  One of which will go nowhere and the other of which will probably go nowhere.  The second I would like to see go somewhere but I am so not holding my breath.  He isn't my type and I am not his.  This of course could be a great thing but old habits, ya know...  
I am so ready to get out and do something fun but recouping this weekend.  I need to refocus on my life again and not party so much.  Next weekend, though... 
Ok, the rest I dont feel like talking about so back to my Tool and mead...."

"event","Well, Greenie stood me up Friday and hasn't been online.  He has been demoted to at most online acquaintance.  I am assuming there is someone else now.  My friend thinks my instincts are correct and I am not being paranoid.  This is too bad but I felt it coming.  I had been thinking previously whether he admits it or not he is pretty broken.  He wants to blame it on bipolar disorder of which I am thoroughly convinced he does not have.  He has no mania from what he has described and what I have seen.  Hyperactivity does not count as mania.  He got angry over his last ""break-up"" and that doesn't count either.  He is on an antidepressant, not any form of lithium.  He probably suffers from ""I don't want to be responsible for going nuts over a girl who never wanted me to begin with.""  He seems to have a hard time accepting that his relationship with this girl was toxic and I fully suspect that it is over because of her and not him.  I also suspect that if she ever wanted him back he would run.  Glad I was smart enough to keep my distance from this one.  He smelled like Paul all along.

I had an impromptu date Friday evening.  The guy's name is Tom and he is a 7th grade science teacher.  He has two science-related master's degrees.  He seems pretty stable, tame, etc. without being too much so.  He was attractive enough, sweet, courteous, definitely seems to be the type to take charge and traditionally male type role model.  (Mind you, all this based on a few hours with him while watching a movie during some of it.  We will see if I am right.)  I found myself going back and forth between ""he is a good catch because..."" and ""he might not be a good catch because...""  I was telling my friend I never even stopped to think about whether I really enjoyed him.  I guess I am so afraid to analyze that first for fear of falling for the wrong guy again.  Oh well not like he is proposing tomorrow.  Time will show."

"event","Ok it is about 6 pm.  I have just stepped out of the bath tub filled with lilac-scented water.  I have spent about an hour primping and preparing.  I step out and finish my grooming.  Hair, make-up, and my best smile.  I go to get dressed.  I put on a black corset and thong garter.  Next I put on black stockings.  I pull on my skirt and a beautiful black crocheted see-through sweater.  I look at my shoes and cannot decide on nice sensible dress shoes or my naughty black boots that always catch everyone's attention.  Knowing my date is very reserved I want to choose the nice shoes but something tells me to go with the boots.  I take a look in the mirror and am pleased with the effect.
I leave, anxious to see what he will think when he sees me.  I swear I am hitting every red light.  Finally, I see his place and I am trying not to rush.  As I pull up I see him peeking out his window watching for me.  ""he's anxious, too,"" I think smiling.  I get out and walk up to his door.
He walks out and it takes him a second to notice me.  ""Hi, so are you ready to... Oh wow...""
""Good wow, I hope..."" I smile.
""Definitely,"" he stares for a minute then says, "" maybe we should stay in tonight.""
""That sounds marvelous but what I have in store will be worth it to not.""
We get into my truck and I drive while he stares quietly.
""What?""  I giggle.
""Nothing,"" he smiles.
""Never known you to be speechless.""
He laughs.
I pull up in front of Desert Oasis Hot Springs.  
""What is this?""
""We are going to enjoy a desert mini-vacation.""
By now dark has started to set in.  We walk through the front doors and the owner greets us, ""Hello, welcome to Desert Oasis, Ms. Jinga and Mr. Green.  We have everything prepared for you.""
We walk into the bathing area.  There is a creek flowing beside a man made pool made to blend in with the natural environment."

Most times youd like to be on<br>your own and away from people. You would be<br>cold towards others, its probably because you<br>just cant trust anyone. Maybe you should loosen<br>up a bit and find som1 you can trust.

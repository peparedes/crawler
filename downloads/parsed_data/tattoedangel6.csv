This is where we used to live
Broken glass, broke and hungry
Broken hearts and broken bones
This is where we used to live

Why did you paint the walls?
Why did you clean the floor?
Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?
This is where we used to live

Why did you keep the mousetrap?
Why did you keep the dishrack?
these things used to be mine
I guess they still are, I want them back

Broke into the old apartment
Forty-two stairs from the street
Crooked landing, crooked landlord
Narrow laneway filled with crooks
This is where we used to live

Why did they pave the lawn?
why did they change the locks?
Why did I have to break it, I only came here to talk
This is where we used to live

How is the neighbour downstairs?
How is her temper this year?
I turned up your TV and stomped on the floor just for fun
I know we don't live here anymore
We bought an old house on the Danforth
She loves me and her body keeps me warm
I'm happy here
But this is where we used to live

Broke into the old apartment
Tore the phone out of the wall
Only memories, fading memories
Blending into dull tableaux

I want them back"

You shoot the moon
And miss completely
And now you're left to face the gloom
The empty room that once smelled sweetly
Of all the flowers you plucked if only
You knew the reason
Why you had to each be lonely
Was it just the season?

Now the fall is here again
You can't begin to give in
It's all over

When the snows come rolling through 
You're rolling too with some new lover
Will you think of times you've told me

Hes more concerned about his car and all that shit. Blah! Stupid materialistic shit. Thats the shit that is going to tear us to the ground. That kinda shit! That stupid useless stuff that is high on the list of his priorities as I silently slip off the edge. Dont know what to do. Everyday I try to just make things better and somehow it works very momentarily. Like every time he calls me he just says ""did they call about the car...oh no okay bye"" and hangs up. Sometimes if I am lucky he remembers to say I love you. So Im at a point where I have tried to make things work...I have worked oh so very hard to make things better...I have fought and somehow things just dont get better. See we have moments where things are great...then I fucking wake up the next morning and things are same old shit. Why is that I wonder. He thinks we have moved too far apart. I feel like he doenst want to try anymore and Adam told me its probably because he knows its over and not worth fixing. Soemthing like that. Which is always possible. I wont disagree with the fact that STEW might veiw the situation as such but I do not agree with the fact that it is over. I think when you put time and energy into things thats when there is strength even when you fall back. The problem is we fell and there wasnt enough toh old us up apparently. Fuck!"

The times it helped me get my tears to fall free. That percise moment in time...sometimes sad moments, sometimes joyous...sometimes just moments that seem irrelevent. If I am remembering are they irrelevant though? Its complicated I suppose. I have grown since these times, I enjoy remembering, just to remind me that I am alive and these are true, honest, times in my life. They happened. Maybe no reason, maybe a huge reason, maybe to bring me closer to where I am. I dont know. Cant help thinking about these times. These places. I find comfort in my memories, and freedom in my stuggles that have past. Past is a good word. I like the thought of things just being in the past and not affecting the present. That is freedom and I think I have found that freedom now."

I could say whatever, and she could do whatever. Like children almost but better. Oh we would gossip and bake cake, and carry on like there was no time but now. And we went shopping. Can you imagine a 20 year old shopping with an 80 year old. She would help me pick out clothes and I would help her. What a wonderful sense she had of my stlye and whatI loved. Never once picked out something I would hate like most grandmothers I hear of. Always was fascinated by my tattoos and never questioned my reasoning behind any of them. Didnt even care when my hair was purple. She told everyone about it proudly. God what a woman! I think I will always carry a piece of my grandmother with me no matter where I go.

I ate one half a brownie too much and Im regretting it so badly right about now. 

So Dar Williams is coming to Minneapolis in April and of course no Tori but Tori is going to Mizner Park Amp. in Boca which was right down the street from our old place.

This song is a poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire, break the glass
And move on into your own, your own

Reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my brain
I hope you'll be ok someday,
So I can say that you moved on in every way
We've seen this and 
We've breathed this and 
We've lived this on our own

This song is a poem to myself

In case of fire, break the glass
And move on into your own

Today we are going to look at matresses. Stew wants a king. We looked at one the other niht but it was entirely over priced when we can get it for like half the price elsewhere. Im tired of stores thouigh. We looked for bedroom sets the other day for like hours on end and then matresses and its just sooooo tiring. Boring! And I cant find a job! 

Last nigth we went to dinner with STews mom and stepdad, Katie and his grandmother. His grandmother seems to think my name is Laura. Its rather adorable. She is so confused. Shes a character though.


My ear is infected and I dont want to take the earring out becauseI dont want it to close us. Its all the way at the top of my ear and its the only one up there left so if I lose it I dont have another one I can use. Damnit. It hurts but hopefully it will get better soon."

"event","Getting kinda annoyed today. Stew is being an ass again. Accusing me of things that didnt happen. Blaming me for fucking everything up. Telling me my attitude always sucks when I feel I have been really okay lately. My attitude does not suck...nor has it inthe past few days. Yeah it did when we first got here the first few days then but lately I have been okay. Its funny how when I feel fine It doenst last for long. He accuses me of not feeling fine and being miserable. Almost like he wants me to be just so he can yell at mea bout it? I dont really understand. Then as I am in the other room just kinda thinking and calming down he storms in yelling that I need to calm down. Well I think thats what I was TRYING to do. Then he tells me to come help put stuff away and I do and then he tells me not to because I am inthe way. What the hell. I am confused adn really just need some time alone. I want to go out adn just be alone but there is no where to go that I know of. I know how to fucking get to Target, Bruggers, and thats like it! Sounds joyous. I just wish he understood me and stopped trying to make me be this horrible person just so he has room to complain. What thehell. I am reallly now starting to get sad. Because of that. I was not before but now I am. Fuck. I try to hard to be happy to love this place to help him to do this and that adn this is usually all I get. I think I am going to start writting down each time he puts me down and makes me feel this way. And at the end of the month look it over and decide what the hell to do. Cant leave but might have to do something. Who knows. I dont deserve to be treated this way. Am I that horrid a person? Apparently!"

Andrew's wife said she would take my fish when we move for her kids and that made me happy because I know they will take care of them. They are not just fish...they are MY fish and I love them so dearly and I am REALLY sad about leaving them but I can call and get the updates once in a while. SHerry said she was going to miss us when we left which was nice considering she has only met us a few times now. Mario and Libuse were there too but came late and got stuck at a table filled with like the people we dont all talk to that much and I was sad for that. So at the bar there was a band and they were okay...not great but okay. They played some Bob Marley and itw as okay. Stacy bought Stew a few drinks and my boss Lisa kept harassing Stew about his piercing since EVERYONE I work with knows about it. I told Andrew and Kathy and somehow they ALL know. IT was funny though! Stew was okay with that though. Luckily. He actually seemed to enjoy himself. It was nice to see. Mario adn I were talking and I think I am going to miss him very much when we move. Him and his wife are such nice people and its sad I need to leave! Oh I cant think about all this right now!

Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality
Beyond the gilded cage.

Cast in this unlikely role,
Ill-equipped to act,
With insufficient tact,
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact.

Living in the Limelight,
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem.

Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation,
Get on with the fascination,
The real relation,
The underlying theme.

Living in a fisheye lens,
Caught in the camera eye.
I have no heart to lie,
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend.

Performers and portrayers,
Each another's audience

ONE BEER and he gave me this fucking attitude and told me not to and its like why cant I do what I want. I was driving home but not for like 4 hours so I think one beer would have been okay.

The problem: I work with a bunch of assholes who probably wont switch days with me because I have to work that Saturday. Andrew would but hes already working. And the other people wont because they suck! Damnit. Its annoying because I will switch with ANYONE ANYTIME if I can because I feel that you s hould because you cant not do it and expect them to help you. But they still dont fucking help! I will have to ask Kathy tomorrow when I go to work. If she says no I will kick her!"

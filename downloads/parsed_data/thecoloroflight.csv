"event","I miss Paula, Soph, and Marg.  I was just reminiscing about the last time all four of us were in the same room at the same time reciting ""I think...we shouldn't have asked...the retarded fellow, AT ALL.""  
Its amazing how vividly i remember insignificant moments with the people I love.  Moments when, at the time, i felt i wouldn't be able to remember because nothing was happening. I just miss the atmosphere in the room when the four of us are together.  The manerisms, recognizable laughter, the inside jokes from 6th grade, Marg's hot ass(boo ya!) Nothing can make old friends.  I cherish what we've got."

"event","I know I am in true hearted company when I can sit in comfortable silence with a person.  Its amazing to find people who you can be quiet with.  Spending your time enjoying eachothers presence rather than cluttering it with small talk.  When you're quiet, you can develop your thoughts into concrete ideas.  To break the comfortable silence, share the thoughts and spark a conversation worth having.  Don't make talk cheap, make silence golden."

"event","I am in love with the romantic era, the fashions, the people, the influence it had on artistic writing. Romantics believed in the ideas of truth, fleeting love, and the beauty of death.  The most interresting portion of this era is the sexual freedom especially among french aristocratic women.  Take Napoleon's Josephine for example.  She was never faithful to him.  Romantics indulged in their lusts.  Romantic men like Blake were enthralled by the female form.  Romantics are responsible for the discovery of bodily beauty. 

Unfortunatly romanticism as a movement has passed.  I rescently encountered a modern-day romantic .  With the standards of modern society he's too promiscuous and often labeled a slut.  Too bad for that. So sad romanticism can't really fit in this world as it is."

"event","Christmas has passed and i gave my parents their gifts, however, I know they weren't very good presents.  I've lived w/ them my entire life and yet, i don't know them well enough to know what to get them as a gift?  It's dissappointingly amazing.  How do you get to really know a person?"

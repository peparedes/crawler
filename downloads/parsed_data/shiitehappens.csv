"event","well i am sick. that's why i haven't written in a few days. i think my last post was sunday so i will go from there.

monday was just like any other day. after school i went to the mecca of griffin, super wal-mart. that place is just too big. then, i went home and slept, thinking that would make me feel better.

tuesday was the best i have felt all week. went to school and then to my friend's house in barnesville. we hooked up my sub-woofer and now i have a bitchin' sound system. i still need to find the correct levels on the amp though, because there is a world of difference between rap and rock n' roll. 

wednesday. i went to the doctor in the morning because the nurse thought i had pink eye. i dont but i do have to put ointment in it four times a day and i cant wear my left contact. driving was hard but at least my stereo sounded good. oh yea zz top with a 10 and a 300 watt amp sounds amazing. 

which brings us to thursday. today is going to be hard because i have a couple tests and i have to work at four. i dont care this experience will be good for me. i need to just sick it up and go on."

"event","well it's sunday. the weekend is just about over. friday i had to work until nine but i left at eight just because i could. i hung out with my buddy kevin. luckily there was no law trouble.

i haven't felt well at all this weekend. it started friday and the combination of sleep deprivation and work has not made it any better. i have so many drugs in me now (most of them legal) because i hate being sick when i have things to do.

well, i dont have to work again until thursday and i'm glad because i dont think i could handle working every day this week. the good thing about working all the time though, is that i have plenty of money in my pocket. everything just seems better when there is money to blow.

girls can be so rediculous sometimes. like when one hurts you very deeply and doesn't apologize and expects you to forget about it. i cant forget about it, i mean everytime i see her face i just want things to be the same. i have given her plenty of opportunities to repent but to no avail. she is just going to have to realise that she made the wrong decision. oh well though, i cant stew about it, that will do no good. i have put my heart out too many times and gotten burned. you'd think i would have learned by now, but i just cant escape nature.

well i really dont know what i am talking about any more so i'd better cease before i say anything too stupid."

"event","it was just another day. (isn't monotony lovely?). talked music and religion with zech. his knowledge of rock and roll is commendable. i have decided that i am very interested in hearing the opinions and beliefs of others. (especially those who can back up what they think with facts or universal truths. 
i have so many tests tomorrow. to study would be a waste of my hard earned time. i am really looking forward to tomorrow. i think i look forward to every new day. it is a chance to start over again. or maybe not. it could be that time doesnt even exist. who says it does? who can prove it does? not me. i dont know.
i hear ""the fuzz"" is going to be out in full force tomorrow. i confirmed this with my po-po friend at work today. he seemed a bit irked that i even broached the subject with him. oh well, i will just have to be extra careful with my grass. jail is not on the agenda for tomorrow. on the bright side i will be getting paid and i only have to work until 8 or 9 so my night of decadence and debauchery can start early.
april thinks she is she isnt pretty. i think that isn't pretty. i try not to call attention to my faults. i think they are blatant enough as it is. i dont know. i need to go visit my best friend sleep. he brings me so much joy. i think i love him. i just cant get enough of him. i think that is enough rambling for today so i will go plan some murders now. (i hope by saying ""plan murders"" the live journal nazi dictator didnt flag my name or anything. oh well)"

"event","I am so proud of myself for doing the best travel packing job of my life today.  I packed everything I need for my VJing tour in 3 bags.  That's right, three bags.  These bags include:
-clothes for a month
-3 pairs of shoes
-2 jackets
-bathroom krap
-a book
-my papers for work
-10 Sharpies
-video mixer
-2 laptops
-videocamera
-digital camera
-bag of adaptors
-bag of RCA cords and power cables
-about 100 DVDs of my merch
-my rainbow jewels

I'm so impressed with myself.  I can carry my life on my back now.  3 bags. Kool.

And yes, I made it to Ottawa today and everything is going incredibly smoothly.  Nice start to this trip thingie, I do say!"

"event","Hey guess what, I'm going to Ontario on Thursday to travel around and VJ for the month.  I'm really excited, a little bit scared, and very happy to get to see my ON homies again.  I'll try to post some news as I travel...so far I have stuff to do in Ottawa, Toronto, St. Catherines, Niagara, London, Windsor/Detroit, and Peterborough. woo-hoo!

Also, I started a new website for all of my entrepreneurial art stuff: 
http://www.otherartists.com
I'll add lots more to it over the summer, it's pretty bare right now but I'm working on it.  Basically, Otherartists is an organizing principle for my projects.  More on that later..."

"event","So Jon Vaughn and I just got back from the send + receive festival in Winnipeg, MB.&nbsp; It was very, very fun, and I reconnected with some tres excellent old friends (Constantine Katrsiris, Martin Tetrerault, Crys Cole) and met some very inspiring new friends (Frieda Abtan, Minibloc, etc...).&nbsp; I love travelling to make art.&nbsp; Yes, indeed.<br /><br />Anyways, here are some videos from the performance I did with Jon:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""1"" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""2"" /><br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""3"" /><br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""4"" /><br /><br /><br /><br />and here is our description:<br /><br /><b>J &amp; C Feedback Factory</b><br />This collaboration between Jon Vaughn (audio) and Carrie Gates (video) is an intimate, yet risky, dynamic, and colourful presentation of live video and audio mixing using ""no-input"" closed system feedback techniques. The audio and video are created live, without using any external sources, such as cameras, microphones, or source tapes and CDs. The audio and video affect one another in surprising ways, but the intensity of the matrices of the complex feedback system are carefully controlled through delicate physical interactions with the machines. Aesthetically, the work pulsates with both human warmth and mechanical error-surfing, creating a sort of psychedelic, synaesthetic effect that hypnotizes viewers in a new world of relationships that are at once alien, but also suggestive of the secret micro-world of electricity and its fluid interactions behind everyday phenomena.<br /><b><br /><br />More info about the send + receive festival:<br /><a href=""http://www.sendandreceive.org"">http://www.sendandreceive.org</a></b><br /><br /><br />(there are more videos coming...8 ""songs"" all together)"

"event","Oh yes, I've been making short silent ambient videos with my sexy friends, Max/MSP/Jitter, and Arkaos and I've been uploading them to YouTube.

Here are a few for you to check out:

"event","Sometimes wonderful surprises happen, and everything changes.
My Dad and his partner were over last night, doing the Xmas thing, when I got a call from my superbeloved old friend Karleen, who lived in my building for about 6 months 4 years ago.  She moved back here from Calgary and she's planning to go to school here next fall...she's an animator and comic artist, and she's really good.  Karleen is just about the most fun person I have ever met in my life...every time we get together, we have the most exquisite trouble-making fun.  She came over after I was finished with my family, and we downed a 2L of Baby Duck and 2 40s of Colt 45.  We smoked, we wrestled, we dressed up in diaphanous nighties.  I have bruises on top of my bruises, and I feel so good! What a nice way to start the new year, with an old friend...

Here are a couple of pictures of our previous adventures (note the fake black eye):

"event","mk, so I've been thinking for a long time about how there are some value conflicts inherent in the rave scene today.  So rave started as an emancipatory, anti-capitalist, ""Temporary Autonomous Zone"", if you will...but now it costs a hell of a lot of money to put together the shows we now call ""raves"".  Gotta pay for the venue, the sound system, the liquor license, the booze, the door staff, the bartenders, teh security, the flyers, oh, and let's NOT FORGET the DJs, VJs, and other talent.  Not exactly what Hakim Bey had in mind for undermining the capital cartography of the State.  So, on this silly-willy raversnet forum I'm on http://www.raversnet.com there is a topic going around about whether or not promoters should have to pay local DJs.  M'kay, well...uh..duh...if the promoter stands a chance to make a profit, I think that the profit should be shared among the labourers.  It isn't right to profit and expect others to volunteer towards your profit.  And hey, if you can't make a profit on a rave that's charging $20-$30 a head, you're doing something wrong, imho. But then there is something truly beautiful about the indie-noise scene that I've been part of for so long....we hardly use any money at all...mostly just to secure a venue, and it's kind of a team effort to put the show together without anyone spending money, or earning any...those events also don't charge more than $free-5, historically, so it definitely is possible to do some types of events without more than a wee wee bit o' cash.

Sooooo, how could we possibly combine the realities of the expectations of today's ravers with the social awareness of the practical anarchist?

Introducing: Anarcho-Commie-Rave

Ever hear of the Time Store?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Time_Store

What if all hours of labour that went towards an event were tracked and used as numbers for dividing profits?  It might even be possible to throw parties entirely without money if this was done well.  Maybe it would work like this:
-Joey = 5 hours designing posters, 4 hours working door (9hours)
-Suzy = 10 hours administering logistics, 3 booking talent, 2 hours getting licenses (15 hours)
-Bobby = 10 hours building stage, 2 hours setting up bar and stage (12 hours)
-Nancy = 3 hours bartending (3 hours)
-Steve = 4 hours preparing for DJ set, 3 hours promoting, 2 hours DJing (9 hours)
-Jill = 4 hours preparing for DJ set, 2 hours DJing, 6 hours making props (12 hours)
-Sam = 10 hours preparing video, 6 hours VJing (16 hours)
-Dana = 8 hours running the sound system, 2 hours transporting and booking the sound system (10 hours)

Ok, so let's also say:
-Dave = venue rental for the night $300 normal rental / $10/hour labour (30 hours)
-Kim = sound system rental $100 normal rental / $10/hour lanour (10 hours)


yes, this is extremely generalized but whateva, I'm just putting this out to express a point

so then let's say the party is from 10pm - 6am...8hours
not everyone would come for the entire night
what if people were charged 1 hour of labour for every 4 hours of partying (or 2 or 8 or whateva)?
check in/check out system
some kind of tracking mech in place
but not tied to government databases or the Internet, for privacy reasons
of course, this all depends on people being inherently good, and there would have to be some way to enforce people to settle their tab...
maybe a ""pay"" option as well as a ""labour"" option (the Time Store used corn as a standard, maybe we could use glow sticks or something [insert huge tongue wag])
monies collected would go towards things that could not be negotiated for in labour...I think that DJs should get a share of that because they have to buy records with $


So here is how it would work:
-someone keeps track of all of the hours
-someone keeps track of the money/corn/glow sticks
-non-labour negotiable things get paid with the money
-labour credits can be transferred between people...so let's say I'm good at fixing bikes...so I trade 2 hours of me fixing bikes for X (to be determined post-event) for admission to the party (if I went for 8 hours at 2 hours labour = 8 hours party)
-at the end of the party, the labour credits get divided up between the labourers and rental people.  Trading and banking of these labour credits would be encouraged.  Some form of evil punishment for people who did not fulfill their labour promised.  ETC...
-obviously, the more this system was used, the more self-maintaining the whole shebang would be.  I can see how people could become very sucessful with this, a la the original Time Store.  


imagine the crazy amount of help promoters would get organizing their events...no more probs finding bartenders, security, or people to help clean up...DJs could finally have someone take care of their housecleaning or childcare or whatever...rental venues could find more people for casual labour cleaning up and doing repairs

and no bitching about money

this would bring together the best of many worlds, but of course, it's pretty ""out there""...ya I'm a dreamer, but maybe in some form this could be cool to try out sometime small-scale.
Lots o' details to consider, but that is a good thing.

laugh if you will, but you'll think about this later ;)"

Tonight I am pumping out an aesthetics essay on Walter Benjamin's ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"".  This weekend, I am writing another paper about the concept of ""originality"" in art, and how this idea emerged around the time of the Enlightenment, hand in hand with the rise of scientific thought and modern capitalism.

I'm going to meet with Ryry for lunch tomorrow, and meet with Meagan in the afternoon. 
I <3 them both.  Such lovely lovelies!

"event","So, the first Saskatoon Anarchist Boook Fair that happened this past weekend was totally excellent.  Mad props go out to Ali Lake and Meagan Wohlberg, the two smashingly righteous babes who organized the event.  I sure hope it happens next year, too!

First, when I arrived (around 2 or 3 on Saturday), I was struck by just how many people were there with tables set up.  Le Relais was filled with lots of people with tables set up, showing off their State-demolishing goods...mostly books and zines, a few bottons and shirts, etc.  Quite a few people were from out of town (mostly Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg), and I was impressed by that.  So cool that people would come all this way to sell merchandise that almost definitley would not recoup their travel costs for them...obviously, those people are just beautifully hardcore, and for that, they earn my luv.  It was really easy to meet people there, and since people had brought their children with them, it had a very welcoming, family vibe, with just the right amount of crustiness to keep it legit.

I was also selling some of my wares at the bookfair...lately I have been making jewellery...but not pretty jewellery that is made in huge batches of multiples, but sort of art-concept jewellery...all one-of-a-kind pieces that have some sort of thought-provoking element to them, often undermining the concepts of ""beauty"", ""high art"", and ""function"".  A lot of the pieces are made with origami, from the patterned origami papers I have been collecting over my lifetime.  Other pieces are made with laquered Fruit Loops, broken shards from 78rpm records, discarded electronics, old toys, alphabet beads, and gold-painted ichiban noodle chunks.  (Pix at the bottom of this terribly long post!) I sold a fair number of pieces, gave away a few, and traded some to people.  I like trading best ;)

Jon and I also were selling copies of a new audio-video collaboration we did.  It's an hour long, and it's called ""59' 59""""...it's a pretty neat project...we both used only mixers to create 9 or 10 different little ""no-input"" compositions that are each 5 minutes long and strung together on a VHS tape in the order that we did them.  We made the stuff by plugging the mixers into themselves in our special mystical ways, so that the audio affects the video, and we improvise the  main structures together sort of like a band jams out riffs.  It is extrememly surprising how varied, bizarre, and hypnotic this tape is, especially considering how there are no source materials for the finished content.  Feedback is so endlessly interesting one you get past the first few landmarks of cliches (that means that just pointing the camera at your tv is a cliche, yes...)...there are a few copies left, limited edition of 20...lemme know if you want one!

So during the bookfair, I left the Pop Quiz table (the indie music/merch table Jon was running that I put my stuff on) and peeked around at the other people's stuff...weirdly, I didn't really want to get a lot of the stuff I saw...I was surprised at how many of the things being sold were actually from commercial publishers, not independent publishers...the people selling the glossy books weren't allowed to trade, so I didn't get anything from them.  That made me realize that some of the people there might have been employees at work, not necessarily anarchists out to sell their own stuff (and the stuff of their friends/community, etc.).  This isn't such a bad thing, but it shows how counter-culture itself is also being commercialized.  I wish there would have been a few more people there selling stuff that they had made themselves, but I do appreciate the diversity that was represented at the fair.  It also would have been nice if more people that came to the fair actually had brought money (or stuff to trade) with them!  Quite a few people came up to my stuff and looked through it longingly, picked out their favourite like they were going to buy it, then would tell me that they wanted to buy it, but they had no money.  Then they would look at me with puppydog eyes like I was supposed to just give it to them or something.  Come on, peeps!  Geez!  My stuff is supercheap, and I do trades.   I really should have had a business card out on the table...I bet I would have got some orders this week...eeek...next time ;)  My prize trade was for these two cool indie zines, both quasi-art-historical accounts, one about pirates in the 15th and 16th centuries, the other one about the history of Hallowe'en and how childeren should be encouraged to invoke fear of destruction into the minds of adults.

The party for the book fair was really stellar.  I'd like to say YO to Meagan and Ali for programming my very favourite people in Saskatoon: Merry Jollies/Jon Vaughn, Freud/Mehta Youngs, Debit Card/Nem Gostramonivix (sp?), and Holzkopf/Jake Hardy.  J-P Crowe also helped out for a bit, too, although he wasn't scheduled...with the addition of J-P, there's a list of the best tune-makers and tune-weavers S'toon has to offer (ok, Jake's in Edmonton now, whateva)...everyone did AMAZING sets...I can't believe the superhype energy when Mehta played his set of new tunes he made over the last few months...my gawd, that guy is cleaning up!  Nem's set was also really good - he's so funny on the mic between his songs...Nem: ""I know you guys don't like it when I play the slow songs, but...COME ON!?!?!?""  hahaha  Seriously awesome show, good times were had, killer decorations, friendly people, sweet-ass tunes...simply lovely.

"event","I was utterly horrified to discover that someone recently stole my stuff that was in the storage room of my apartment building.  All gone. These boxes included my sewing supplies (that were my mom's and my grandma's!), my sewing machine, my vintage magazines, art supplies, some old tapes, some cool accessories, and (gasp) my 1980s Barbie collection!  Oooooh, and I had all of the punk Barbies from the ""Barbie and the Rockers"" series, too...the ones from about '87, including the Chinese punk Barbie with the orange eyeliner...and the redhead punk Barbie with the afro...I'm so very, very sad about this. I am trying to see the good in it, which is that I have that much less stuff to cart around with me for the rest of my life.  It's not very comforting, though.  The extra frustrating thing is that I have a strong suspicion that all of my stuff is still in the building, but in someone else's apartment. ARRRRG!

On a brighter note, I successfully laminated some Fruit Loops yesterday, and they feel coooool."

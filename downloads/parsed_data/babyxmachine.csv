I've decided that for the month of august i will try and go to NYC to see lian and kate and tammy. and of course all the other folks i know there.

i had to work this morning at 4:45am bleh, but my coworker accidently came in at the same time so she said she would stay and i got to go home and go back to sleep... yeah! i needed it cus i'm STILL trying to shake this sick/flu/cold thing that i've had for a week now. so anyway i slept and then went to work at the gypsy den where i worked all of about 4 hours and then left to go home. 
(insert circus music) 
let me back track to a week ago... i came out to my car at this parking structure and i had a warning note on my car stating that ""i am parked in an oversized vehicle area"" for those of you who know what i drive, you would think... well yes danielle HAS an oversized truck... not that it's huge but it's definitely not a fucking geo metro or something, so anyway i talk to the lady and she says she doesn't know what to say cus she didn't give me the warning... 
now today, so i decide today that ok, i will park where they want me to park... so i park and while i'm leaving i notice they have these cones in the middle of this already exceptionally SMALL turn, and for a moment i consider running them over, because well it just sounds fun, but i don't and so i make the first turn and then i go to make the second sharp turn, and BOOM! i apparently hit a curb with my tire. i don't really think much of it because it was pretty unavoidable unless i had run down the cones... so i pull up to leave and then the guy tells me you know your tire just exploded.... 
(insert laughter) 
why laughter, well why not, there's no use getting upset over this shit anymore i mean oh well right? so i'm sitting there thinking well at least i have a spare tire. and then i realize shit when my keys got lost at the ludacris concert like a year ago my spare key tire was on there so now i can't really remove my spare tire it's just stuck up underneath my car...  and then i come to the other conclusion that i don't have AAA. so i decide i will take the tire off and go to the tire store with the tire and make them just change it and i'll put it back on when i get back to the tire... like 45 minutes goes by and i finish all that... (that's right this bitch can change a tire like faster then lightening) 
so then i leave the parking structure and notice this weird smell thing... (side note) occasionally my truck has been leaking coolant lately... so now my car is leaking massive amounts of coolant... so i had to take my truck in to get the water pump fixed... there goes another $275... have i mentioned i HATE having a car.. i just want a little vespa with a side car, that lian can ride in. and i wanna like figure out some way to put a bike rack on it... that's all i want... some day it will happen... so ya that was my day... don't be jealous."

i finally tried to track down my hypnotherapist last night since when i stopped by his office a week or so ago, he was no longer there... and last night i discovered he's now living in florida, which fucking sucks cus he's probably the only person who's ever helped me get myself better. but i e-mailed him and and asked if he could recommend be to someone else, or if he ever does seminars out here still. so he e-mailed me back and gave me his office number and cell phone number, so i will try calling him tomorrow.

monday: got bitched out by angela, and now angela and rosy have become best friends and rosy won't return any of my calls or talk to me anymore, hence i am through with rosy we are no longer friends. 6+ years of friendship has come to an end, why? i still don't know what i did. also later this evening while getting yelled at by angela, jordan calls me to tell me she got evicted and lost her job, so we were emo on the phone together. i talked to my mom about everything going on and that was good but just made me sad and made me wonder if rosy made up all the shit about the squab kids. then my cell phone got thrown down on the ground and the screen broke so now i can't see who's calling me, it sucks.
tuesday: i worked and felt like shit because of the loss of my best friend. waited at the DMV for two hours convincing the lady to allow me to register my car in two states so i don't have to pay all over again in oregon, she finally let me. then about 15 minutes after leaving the DMV my dad called me to tell me that in one week, next wednesday, we have to testify in court against the people who broke into my house. now let me just say that this upsets me, i did not want to have to see these people. i just started being able to sleep again with the help of sleeping medicine because of the break in. 
today: i received a phone call from allison. she called to tell me that her old housemate chris, trish's boyfriend died this past weekend. apparently he was in mexico working on an organic farm there of some sort and he had gone swimming and he drowned, they have yet to find his body. allison is really sad which makes me really sad and i can't even imagine what trish and tara are going through. i think i may drive to sf this weekend to see allison i think i need to get out of here for a little bit."

"event","so i have decided after a much draining last couple of weeks, that something has to change.  Something that will not only make me feel better but make me nicer to people around me, and not so fucking irritable. So i've decided to cut sugar out of my diet again, i'm going to shoot for a month and go from there. So wish me luck.  
things have been weird in my life as usual lately.  i've been talking a lot to an ex, and we're planning a trip together, i just don't want to feel like i'm being enclosed like i did the last time with her. i don't really know what i want from her right now, i know i want for me to be happy again and that's all i'm really trying to focus on right now. I've also been talking with this other girl i have this crush on.  I've had a crush on her for a few months now, catch is she lives in portland and i don't think it would be smart for me to act on any feelings that i'm having right now mainly because i don't know where they are coming from. maybe loneliness, boredom, sadness, or maybe i really like her who the fuck knows anymore, i know i don't which is why i don't think i should react to it. 
i got my new/old drum set today. it's an old gretsch drum set, i am currently researching what year and it's value i have a few of the model/serial numbers so if any one has any websites that would have any info on this i would love you sooo much. 
I'm finding this need to do something creative lately. i'm kinda kicking myself in the ass for thinking rosy would actually follow through with something and actually make time to play music with me. it's too fucking bad i'm so fucking insecure musically, it really prevents me from doing anything creative.  and i still wish barb wouldn't have been such an idiot, cus we actually sounded really good together. oh well though good riddance to her.
I got all my paper work today and filled it out so i can get a new passport. i'm starting to get nervous about this trip, it's like 5 months away, i hope i pay off the car in time... 
i'm so damn tired from no sugar i thin ki'm going to sleep like a baby tonight..."

Your Sun Sign is in Capricorn

Capricorn
December 22 - January 19 
Capricorn, the tenth Sign of the Zodiac, is all about hard work. Those born under this Sign are more than happy to put in a full day at the office, realizing that it will likely take a lot of those days to get to the top. That's no problem, since Capricorns are both ambitious and determined: they will get there. Life is one big project for these folks, and they adapt to this by adopting a businesslike approach to most everything they do. Capricorns are practical as well, taking things one step at a time and being as realistic and pragmatic as possible. The Capricorn-born are extremely dedicated to their goals, almost to the point of stubbornness. Boy, those victories sure smell sweet, though, and that thought alone will keep Capricorns going. 
The Goat symbolizes Capricorns, and an apt mascot it is. Goats love to climb to the top of the mountain, where the air is clear and fresh. In much the same way, Capricorns want to get to the top of their chosen field so that they can reap the benefits of success; namely fame, prestige and money. Getting to the top isn't always a walk in the park, however, so it's likely that Goats will ruffle a few feathers along the way. These folks can indeed be domineering, even egotistical, on their route to the top. They'll tell you it's part of being a leader with bright new ideas (in keeping with the Cardinal Quality assigned to this Sign). 
Capricorns are industrious, efficient, organized and won't make a lot of waves. They are scrupulous with details and adopt a rather conventional posture in business and in life. These folks feel best playing it safe, since this is a fail-safe way to get to the top -- eventually. 
Thankfully, Capricorns are patient, too, and are happy to wait for their ship to come in. The flip side to this staid behavior is that Goats can become quite unforgiving of those who aren't as diligent or ambitious as they are. Capricorns need to remember that they do need allies along the way, ambitious or otherwise. In any case, once Capricorns receive the recognition and social status they so fervently crave, it's likely that all will be forgiven. 
Your Rising Sign is in Aquarius
If your Rising Sign is Aquarius, you may seem aloof and self-introspective, maybe a bit outlandish. Though you seem detached, you also give the impression that you care very deeply for humanity -- just not necessarily individual humans! You'll likely attract friends easily thanks to this Aquarian influence, but be wary of the more negative traits of the Water Bearer. Sometimes you can come off as rude or thoughtless -- as well as willfully eccentric. Despite these characteristics, you'll still be wildly popular, due in large part to what people see as the innovative Aquarian brain power.

Your Moon is in Cancer

You respond very much to the emotional tone and atmosphere around you, and can be dominated by your fluctuating and unpredictable moods. You often appear irrational to others because you cannot always explain the reason or source of your feelings. Anyone who lives with you must accept your ups and downs and appreciate your need for times of withdrawal.

You are also very sympathetic and understand the unspoken feelings and needs of others. You take slights and rebuffs very personally and though you may forgive a transgression by a friend or loved one, you never forget it.

Your Mercury is in Capricorn
Clear, objective, and realistic, you are unimpressed by exaggerated claims or promises. You insist upon being shown facts to back up any statement you hear, and your natural skepticism often borders on cynicism. You approach problems clearly and rationally and maintain your poise and objectivity even in the midst of critical situations. Anyone seeking your advice is certain to get an unemotional and unbiased assessment of their situation, and you therefore make a good arbitrator or judge. You are thorough, conscientious, and disciplined in your thinking, and have an aptitude for business, organization, and administration. You are also a good strategist, and will plan and patiently follow a realistic course which will lead to your eventual success. Serious-minded and studious, you enjoy quiet time alone for thinking or reading.

Your Venus is in Sagittarius 
The dance card is packed for those with their Venus in Sagittarius. Spotting one potential lover is not likely the case, for these folks are attracted to many. This is the kind of situation which can make life interesting, to say the least. Does this mean those with this placement will never settle down? Not necessarily - it just means the search for a mate will be a spirited one! What's essential in this search is turning up a partner with a similar quest for adventure and penchant for activity. The freedom to be is also ideal, and once committed, those with Venus in Sagittarius are loyal and honest in their relationships. Happy feet are likely to afflict those with Sagittarius in their House of Love, as they love to travel and have a wandering spirit. As well, any type of physical activity or body movement is zen to these folks. Yoga? Meditation? Bioenergetics? It's likely to work for these happy souls. When the Archer is shooting his bows into your Love shack, just hope that he brings along with him a kindred spirit who understands that mental and physical stimulation along with a lust for life will always hit the bull's-eye! 

Your Mars is in Capricorn
If your Mars is in Capricorn, you may have tremendous endurance and tenacity to accomplish what you put your mind to. You are focused and practical, bringing tremendous energy into a controlled and directed outlet. You work hard, and are a respectable, determined lover, worker, and friend. You are willing to put in the time it takes to build a relationship that is truly satisfying and mutually beneficial. Your lover will find you stable, thoughtful, and down to earth. Your potency attracts people who admire you and recognize you for your efforts and practical nature. Sensuality and a muted, underlying passionate nature make you an excellent catch for anyone who enjoys peace, stability, and a no nonsense approach to life! You offer stability to your relationships and are happiest when you and your partner are working toward a common goal.

Your Jupiter is in Leo
You can find luck through your own charisma and drama. Through your strong, enthusiastic personality, you can attract much success and attention -- sales or the theater are just two arenas where you could do well. Easy-going, you can let rejection roll off of you. You must, however, learn to temper your tendency toward exaggeration and pomposity if you want people to take you seriously.

Your Saturn is in Virgo
Your obsession with perfectionism and order can leave you feeling frustrated and in a rut. You have an almost compulsive attention to detail which may have been learnt from a parent or authority figure. Often times you discourage yourself and others from trying new things simply because they won't be done the way you think they should be. Your karmic path is to always feel trapped within the lines and yet afraid to color outside of them. Fear is the basic motivation behind this desire for order -- it is the only way you know of controlling your environment. If you are capable of overcoming this fear -- letting go of control -- you have a chance of developing an imaginative side where your practicality could become a valuable asset.

Your Chiron is in Taurus
If Chiron falls in Taurus in your chart, you bear a pain of neglect or that what you have is never enough. This Chironic placement makes a person who -- because of a wound of neglect (perhaps your parents were stingy with affection or even completely closed off from you) or actual physical hunger -- bears a mental or physical pain that weakens the spirit and body. At the heart of Taurus is a yearning for security and the pleasure of sensory stimulation: food, physical affection, bodily nourishment. Taurus loves to indulge, but with Chiron in Taurus, you're never quite full; as your stomach can feel empty, so too can your heart. Rather than wallowing in the haze of your hunger for what you lack, Chiron in Taurus encourages you to appreciate what you have. By cherishing gifts you already possess, you can share what you've learned from your pain with others. Give your time to causes dealing with a lack of resources: homelessness, hunger, neglected children, or for those wanting for affection or sensory or material comfort. 

Your Uranus is in Scorpio
When Uranus enters the already secretive Scorpio, it is a time of transformation. Those born with this placement will be consistently reinventing themselves, trying on new personas and personalities like so many wigs. You may compulsively search for change within yourself and the world around you. Issues surrounding sexuality might play an important part within your generation. There could be a backlash against the knowledge that, in this day and age, sex can kill. This could play out in extreme methods of sex and the dismantling of old taboos. During your time, you may find that topics such as sex and death stop being spoken of in whispers. This energy will also be harnessed into positive change. You may one day feel comfortable being exactly whom you choose to be. 

Your Neptune is in Sagittarius
You are part of a 14 year group of people that are extremely idealistic and farsighted in their dreams. Your age group is very liberal and expansive in outlook, and consequently churches become much more flexible and more eclectic in their approach during your life time. Religions that do not adapt to the broad-minded attitude of your age group simply are unable to attract very much interest and involvement from you.
A great deal of metaphysical musing and speculation is evident in your age group, and there is a very strong interest in all manner of psychic phenomena, UFO's, prophecy, etc. This interest will open many new doors and insights, but will also often lead to a great deal of fantasizing and speculation that is taken more seriously than it should be.

Your Pluto is in Libra
The focus of Libra is on relationships. Many babies are born when Pluto is in Libra as a result of their parents making efforts to improve and revitalize their relationships. These children grow up watching their parent's relationships either thrive or fail completely. This generation, however, is determined to make all of their partnerships work out. They watch what has worked for previous generations and incorporate it into their own lives, and they see what has failed in the past and try to make working changes. Some of those born while Pluto was in Libra might cast aside the idea of formal marriage in favor of more unconventional approaches to unity. Others, however, may decide that the free-form approach does not work and choose to rely on the more conservative elements that worked for marriage in earlier generations. 

Your Ceres is in Aquarius
Ceres-Aquarius retains the natural traits which makes the Aquarian Sun such a world-beater. You are not afraid to try new things, to innovate and discover, and that makes you a very powerful woman indeed. Instead of lazing around during your down time you'll want to nurture yourself and be out chasing your dreams, no matter how outrageous or unorthodox they may seem to others. You like to try new things and do things differently -- you may be the first to jump on new methods or technologies. Use your powerful brain and surging ambition in your free time and you'll be happily satisfied with your off-the-beaten-path style. Others see you as a natural leader, with the power and conviction to let you help others to realize their dreams. You support those you love and see merit in even their craziest ideas. Friends and associates will look to you for a shoring up, ensuring that you're in on the ground floor of new schemes. You don't intend to play the boss or team leader in new schemes, but may end up leading anyway as others fall behind your zeal and courage.

Your Juno is in Aquarius
The typical long-term relationship is not for you -- you won't be satisfied with contentment or with comfortable bickering. Your partnership is likely to be different than the norm. Perhaps you will negotiate for more time to follow your daring schemes, or you may be involved in long-distance relationships or in otherwise unusual partnerships. Whatever you work out you will negotiate with your usual charm and desire for independence. Too much togetherness is your bane; you need time on your own to carry out your plans and desires. You are willing to try anything once, which can bring both exciting and unusual experiences and downfalls when you let your heart rule your head. Domesticity is not for you either, and you may find that you never settle down into a long-term partnership. It's not that you can't or that no one wants you; instead, it may be you who rejects comfort for excitement and Juno-Aquarians who make this choice will get love and affection from friends and family instead.

Your Pallas is in Capricorn
Leading just comes naturally to you and you excel at showing others what needs to be done and setting them on the proper path. You're a natural authority, and will find yourself taking over any group which lets you do it! Others look to you as an authority, even those who are older and more experienced than you, because your natural confidence shows through whatever you do. Pallas-Capricorn is a superb fighter to have on any team -- you rally to causes in which you believe and see them through to the end. You're the first into battle and the last to leave the battlefield. The vague ideas and plans which others have are crystallized under your lead -- you excel at turning plans into reality with your firm practicality. You are gifted with drive, determination and plenty of ambition, both in your career and personal life. Others may occasionally see your authority as intrusive, but most will be more than willing to let you take charge as is your natural inclination.

Your Vesta is in Aquarius
You are happiest when you're devoted to a cause in which you idealistically believe in, especially one in which you feel you're leading others down a path to a better future. Vesta-Aquarius is a superb leader, but your talents are better suited to leading a group rather than the one-on-one service perhaps others would prefer. Your boundless energy is well-used to further a cause in which you believe, particularly a humanitarian or political movement. You will work tirelessly for your ideals and you care deeply about advancing rights and freedom for yourself and for others. Someone needs a creative thinker? That's you all over. Your downfall is a tendency to selfishness -- you may seem sometimes to care more about the welfare of the masses than those close to you, even though your friendships are vital to you. Vesta-Aquarians may also have a great need to define and focus aspirations rather than just striking out at full power. This strategy helps to focus your commitment, and the support you receive from your many friends will complete the deed. In the bedroom you will enjoy anything which is unusual and you'll try anything at least once.

Leo Descendant

If Leo lies on your Descendant, you're hunting for a mate who is as gregarious and sociable as you, but who possesses the sort of resolute confidence and emotional expressiveness that you sometimes feel you lack. Since you have Aquarius Rising -- a Sign associated with aloof intellectuality and humanitarian interests -- you need a mate who will counter your self-deprecating pride with their own brand of pride -- of a more effervescent, positive variety. You hold your own in the spotlight, assured and well-spoken. When the attention turns to your love life, though, to sharing your most intimate emotions with another person, you run and hide, fearful of being pinned down or caged; and yet you instinctually seek out romantic partners who are steadfast and loyal and who will worship you and spoil you with unconditional support and affection."

"event","i've had a wild and intense last few days. they were good and amazing but i feel a bit sad today.  so after last friday when bob and i hooked up, i felt like i was in some crazy daze we spent the past like week and a half hanging out. on sunday i got a call from bob and christopher and they invited me to have lunch with them.  so i went to christophers house and stayed for a bit and then went to vera's cus i've been kinda flakey about hanging out with her lately, mostly cus i am working too much but ya so i went there and her and bob and aubree and a couple other kids were just getting done with band practice.  so we talked for a bit and then they all left and bob and i stayed on vera's porch talking for a while.  we're really good at processing with one another. we had a sober talk finally regarding everything she basically apologized for being so drunk when we hooked up, which well she isn't the only one at fault, and said she would really feel better about everything if we could have sex sober. ha. i told her she didn't have to ask me twice. so since we were going to the hot springs the next day she came over to my house that night and stayed the night... um ya being with her is amazing and beautiful and everything i wanted it to be and more... we woke up really late the next day and made an amazing breakfast with the girls downstairs. we would steal kisses every once in a while. i think she responds to touch like i do, i like holding hands and being close to people, and kissing, and its nice to have a friend that is ok with doing that also.  so we went to breitenbush and our friend jackie came.  we all traded massages while we were in the hot springs. it was fucking amazing i really could feel all the bad energy leaving the both of them when i gave them a massage, it made me all shakey and i kinda had to block their energy from coming in side me cus i had shit that was releasing as well. we left to go home and i think i was driving 25 all the way through the mountains i was so calm i didn't care, in fact no one in the car did we were enjoying the rain pouring down onto my car and watching it slap on the road in front of us.  when we got back bob and i hung out at the house for a bit and then i gave her a ride home cus we were all just too beat.  we fell asleep talking at her house and we cuddled all night.  tuesday i had a pot luck at my house, i made vegan chili and vegan cornbread, it had bananas in it, it was so damn good! cam, chad, steph, wendy, bobby, sarah marie, bridget, caitlin and bob were there.  ya talk about my favorite fucking people on the planet. those are the people that will still be in portland when i leave, those are the ones that i love and am leaving.  bob and i stayed up again late that night talking, she was stressing about buying a plane ticket to go home so i helped her find a cheap flight (i'm obsessed with bargain shopping for airline tickets online). so we got her a ticket and she felt all the stress go away she said... she ended up passing out and we cuddled and kissed til we fell asleep.  so yesterday i was completely exhausted at work i think i had 3 or 4 hours of sleep.  after work i went and got a gift for bob to take with her, i got her this rose quartz stone, cus she's having to face some yucky things at her moms wedding i just wanted her to know that we all loved her and there was so much positive energy coming from that stone that i had to get it for her... we went to holocene last night, it was caitlins last queer night in portland, hence we were fucking tossed! we danced our asses off, i felt sick by the end of the night, i came home and passed out... 
bob is leaving in an hour for new mexico. i'm sad that when she gets back i will be leaving like a couple weeks later, but i'm happy that we got to hang out and solidify our friendship.  it has all really had an impact on my life. she asked me on monday night if she thought we would be friends when we were old, and i told her i always have thought that, which is why i've never felt a super urgent feeling to need to hang out with her, i knew it would happen eventually. everything works itself out over time."

"event","ok so yesterday started off as the shittiest MOST annoying and fucked up day ever. i can't count how many times i stopped and broke down and cried.  my pay check didn't get deposited into my account for some fucked up reason and now i won't get the check till next week sometime. and i had to deal with a thousand annoying asshole customers and a few shithead coworkers... all i wanted to do was come home and drink a fucking beer when i got off of work, but i couldn't because my ex girlfriend was in town and she's in AA and she was going to be making amends to me, and apologize for a bunch of shit that happened while we were together.. so when i got home from work i took a long nap and then went to dinner with anna. which was really nice we went to le happy and ate crapes.  then we went for a walk in the park and she read me this letter which was really awesome, made me cry and made me think about CA. she told me that i was the first person that got her to go to AA and i was the main support for her. it was nice. she also told me that she has noticed i've changed a lot since then which i was aware of but it's always nice to hear that other people actually have noticed.  after that we walked to the store and got some snacks and headed home.  i was suppose to go to a party at vera's house but didn't quite make it there.  i went to stephs house cus it was her birthday. bob, cam, chad and sarah marie were there... some of my most favorite people in portland right now, i'll have you know.  the evening started getting a bit better for me after that bob and i talked for a bit and talked about how shitty our day was.. i guess she cried all day too. so we stayed at steph's house for a while and then bob came home with me and we had a drunken confessional session, it was pretty intense and beautiful. i love bob so much she's such a great amazing person and i'm really glad our friendship has gone to this level, and it seems to be a mutual thing, which makes me happy. she kept telling me that she was really attracted to me which was weird for me to hear, i don't know i guess i don't think very highly of my appearance so hearing that form her of all people made my heart melt, and i asked her to tell me that again when she wasn't drunk, and then she told me she had told me that and she knew the exact day it was and where we were.  i asked her if i was drunk when she said that to me and she said she thought i was, in which i told her i probably intentionally forgot. i don't know how to deal with positive comments sometimes. i told her how much i respected her and how grateful i was to have her in my life. she was really supportive when i first moved to portland, she actually came up to me one night before we met and noticed i was upset and talked to me about stuff with libby, and was really there for me emotionally when no one else would be and it was beautiful and i've had this bond with her ever sense. but anyway we kissed again and pretty much had a replica of last weekend,and i had hardly any sleep. worked at 6 in the morning, and then came home hoping she'd still be here, but she had already left. we're going to go for a trip to the hot springs on monday it should be fun, i'd like to hang out with her without alcohol.
when i got home today from work i checked my e-mail and chris had finally e-mailed me regarding the squab situation, i'm kinda sick of talking about it, mostly cus it hurts my heart thinking that my friends are not friends anymore back home. but maybe i can help patch some of it up, who knows. i keep wondering if things would have been different with squab if i was still down there, but i guess we'll never know."

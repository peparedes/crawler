Well, Chris is at work.  I was going to go get him, but his car wouldn't start.  It's 8:10, i should be in school.  I guess today will be a little break for me.

Well, I'm going to clean up the mess the dog made last night.  I'm out.... PEACE

"event","Hey, I'm bored, just ate pancakes.  And I'm ready to go see Chris.  We had a lot of fun this weekend.... SO FAR cuz it's a 3 day weekend.  Anyways, I am pissed cuz today is sunday and we can't go to the tanning bed.... ahhh.  But I made $20 at the flea market yesterday with Lucy.  Getting money for your bullshit is great.  Some ppl will buy anything.  We're going next weekend again, hopefully katie will come too!  Well ya'll, I'm going to make a cd, peace."

"event","What up!  This was a sad week because of Jeremy's death.  I didn't really know him, but it's still very sad.  I didn't do a whole lot this weekend, but hang out with Chris and Katie.  We're gonna get fat from eating so much, lol.  But its all gravy, as long as we're happy.  Anyways, shout out to Chris for working so hard and being the best boyfriend in the world.  I love ya boo!  :)  Well, I'm going to finish painting that thing for him.  Peace outttttt!

"event","What up! I'm bored so I decided to make one of these thingys. Anyways, today was my 2nd day of school. But... only 88 more days of highschool left, and only 17 days until I turn 18!!! So... today I left school a little early, hung out with the love of my life, Chris. Then my baby had to leave, and I made chicken cassarole so my daddy would be happy with me. (It's good as shit, ask Katie or Chris.) If you don't know me then you should know a big part of my life is being with my boyfriend Chris. He's the best thing thats ever happened to me and I love him to death."

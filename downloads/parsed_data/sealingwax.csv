"event","Dear Brookview Commons + The Danbury Fire Department,
First of all Brookview, I do not understand why you would design a system that would allow for a water heater to FREEZE while people are away, therefore causing said water heater to BURST when the residents come home and take a shower. I do not appreciate standing in the frigid 12 degree weather while you fire men, in your huge warm coats, laugh at the twenty residents standing outside. While it was kind of you to allow us to stand in the lobby, it was not kind of you to tell us at 4 different times that we would be allowed back in our rooms and then take it back. And now that I am finally allowed to ""reoccupy"" since the pipe burst was on the COMPLETE OPPOSITE SIDE of the building, you are in the hallway yelling loudly about squeegees and electrical wiring. Please return to the other side of the building where the issues are occurring and let me go to sleep.

Good night and good luck.
I hate you all.
- Amanda-Lynn Sousa

PS: You owe me a new pair of moccasins. Mine look treacherous now.



A Side Letter:

Dear Tim the RA,
Thank you for being entertaining. At least I had a few good laughs while my feet slowly became icicles.
Love, Amanda"

First of all, can we please discuss how I managed to fit an entire semester's work of photography class into two days? Yeah, I'm awesome. I shot two rolls of film yesterday, developed the film this morning, walked to buy cigarettes while the negatives dried, came back and printed my entire portfolio. I am awesome. And the pictures are actually really good. Mostly of Ted since I shot an entire roll of him walking around Tarrywile that came out wonderful. Critique is Tuesday. Hopefully I pass. Burdick kind of hates me.

I still have two papers to write for Philosophy (Whatever), 80 sketches to do for Figure Drawing (Which will take a day), Puzzle piece design for 3D (Which will take 15 minutes), and a media presentation for Psych (which I will hand in late and I don't really care.)

I need a new job. ASAP. This whole three hours a week thing really isn't working out for me. I can't even enjoy all my free summertime because everything costs money, but because I never work, I never have money. So, I sit at home. And waste my life. This needs to not happen anymore. I need money. Anybody know somewhere that will hire someone with literally open availability until the beginning of September? =/

<b>Martini-Related</b>
First of all, I need to get on organizing a summer rehearsal. This is going to be a pain in the ass and damn near impossible. But there are some amazing opportunities for us to sing in the late fall, which means we need to at least get together and figure out parts or something. Apparently, the Danbury Cultural Commission or whatever, gave my dad a grant to put on a big deal concert with his group. Which obviously means, Martini is already on the line-up. He's leaning toward November/Decemberish, so we can throw in a little bit of holiday music and advertise it as a big holiday concert. Which means those simple, basic, four part harmony Christmas songs that are tucked in the back of the music files will actually get pulled out. Plus, if we sing a concert in December, our May concert will be that much more pimp. Also, I don't think we'll be able to pull out anything for ICCA this year, but this is the year we are going to buckle down so we actually have a chance to hold our own with the big guys. (BYU Noteworthy, youtube them. Seriously, we sound like crap compared to those girls.) But, I think with the girls we have coming in, plus the return of Brownie, not only will we be covered from our big losses (Miss Colleen and Dima Baby) but  we have a pretty great ensemble happening.


That's really it, I guess.

I spend too much time on youtube.

And I love Cat Jacocks. Because I spend all my time with her.

And I love Colleen Hermann. Because she randomly appears in Danbury and makes me smile.

And I love Stephany Blanchard. Just because. =] Oh, and because she'll be home soon. YAY!"

Apparently, the shark I saw was a replacement shark, because the original was decaying so much. Something about bleach. Whatever.

But the greatest part of the entire article, was this line:
Hirst's response to those who said that anyone could have done this artwork was, ""But you didn't, did you?""

"event","alright, let's do some more explaining this time around.

my father is back in hospital. he had another brain attack sunday afternoon when i was home with him. i had to call 911 and it was probably the most frightening thing i've ever had to do. i called my mom at work and told her to come home. and i texted crystal and told her i needed her to come over. my sister was shopping with her friends. so as the ambulance was leaving, crystal came over. and i just avoided my house all day. apparently, he has a tumor in the exact same place as last time. i went to see him today and in comparison to the last time around, he already seemed much better. and he starts chemo on wednesday. which is baby sister's birthday. (yes, we've made the connection that last time it was my birthday, and this time it is her's.) he's convinced he mentally fucked me up, but i'm honestly fine. i'm pretty sure we all knew it was coming, but nobody wanted to say it.

i don't remember if i mentioned that i quit hurcs in here, but i did quit. and at the time, i said it was truly that my heart just wasn't in it anymore. but i think in the back of my mind, i knew my dad wasn't himself. he'd been stuttering more and more and having trouble communicating what he was trying to tell us. i didn't want to admit that i knew it was coming but i couldn't be away every weekend knowing that i could be getting that awful phone call from my mom. so yes, my heart wasn't in it, but i think it was trying to warn me. if i hadn't quit, i would have been at practice and my father would have been home alone and there is no way he would of been able to call 911 on his own. that's not coincidence, i was meant to be home.

sidenote: i know choquette is on my friends list. i don't know what philip told the guard, but i never said anything about the girls being bitchy or whatever. i don't know where that came from. all i told him was that my heart wasn't in it and i felt guilty not giving my all when everyone else was so dedicated. sorry if it got twisted in a different light.

in other news, colleen came up for the baseball game today, but it got cancelled. and she's sleeping at crystal's right now and is spending the day tomorrow. thank god. and terranova will be here tomorrow, and i'm excited about that.

also, i've been practicing driving with jessica and today with her and colleen. apparently, i don't suck. my goal is to get my license by the end of the summer, which will be wonderful. and stephyface comes home next month, which i really need right now.

also also, i'm looking for a new job. bath and body works sucks, and never schedules me. and if my dad isn't working, i need to make sure i have a steady flow of cash to pay for brookview and other things, because i won't be able to rely on him. so, if anyone knows of somewhere that is hiring, let me know.

and yes, i'm fine. i promise. my friends are amazing and i thank all of you for hanging out with me, visiting, texting, calling and everything else. you guys are amazing. seriously. <3"

decent arrangement.

but please watch the vocal percussionist.
apparently, he's not beatboxing, he's playing an invisible drum set.
and when he's not playing his set, he's doing some sweet hip shaking.
i laughed. a lot.

"event","i got tagged, and i'm in the midst of a mental breakdown. therefore, here we go.

Once you've been tagged, you have to write a blog with 10 random things, facts, habits or goals about yourself. At the end, you choose about 10 people to be tagged, listing their names and why you chose them. Don't forget to leave them a comment or message saying ""You're It!"" and telling them to read your blog. You can't tag the person who tagged you. Since you can't tag me back, let me know when you've posted your blog so I can see your answers!

1. I hate meeting new people. I will never introduce myself to someone, I'll wait until someone else does it for me. It complicates my life a bit.

2. I absolutely cannot make important decisions on my own. There are a core group of about four people whose opinions I base 90% of my choices on. If I don't directly ask their opinion, I will still think ""What would so and so say?""

3. Unlike most people, I know exactly what I want to do with my life. I just don't think I can do it.

4. I'm terrible at keeping in touch with people who live far away. I don't call, I don't write letters, I don't do anything. The only exception is Stephany and I don't talk to her nearly as much as I should. But at the same time I know that even after months of separation and rarely talking to her, nothing will have changed between us. Sometimes that consistency is the only thing that keeps me sane. (Hi Stephy. :])

5. I miss winter guard a lot. I watch guard dvds all the time. They make me smile.

6. I honestly have no idea why I started smoking. I have no idea why I continue to smoke. I also have no desire to quit smoking. I know they are bad for me, but for some reason, I'm okay with that.

7. I actually don't care that I don't have a license. I feel like if I could drive, I'd have the means of running away from things instead of dealing with them.

8. I'm constantly paranoid that my father isn't actually better and that his cancer is going to come back worse than before. Everytime he stutters or has an MRI, I get extremely nervous.

9. I'm terrified of going blind. I'm more afraid of that than bridges. And as everyone knows, my fear of bridges is pretty intense.

10. I get in really self-deprecating moods. Also, I can never for the life of me come up with positive qualities about myself. Even when I'm in the greatest mood ever. (Example: The nine facts above.)

I'm tagging...
1. Colleen
2. Cat
3. Ericar
4. Robert Sniffin, even though he probably won't see this.
5. Molly
...and anyone else who wants to because everyone else I would have picked, Stephany did.


In other news, I have too much to do and not enough time to do it in. I'm going to explode."

anyways, back at school. it's pretty awesome. i actually want to go to class now that i truly like my major. i have no problem dragging my ass out of bed to go to drawing. art history is another story, but that's only because that woman does not speak english. and the room is hot as balls. (BOLAS!) also, i've learned that apparently, if i try, i don't actually suck at drawing. which is pretty awesome.

working at bath and body works is basically awful. i hate work. but it pays pretty well for not doing much. i ask people if they want to try our new lotion and tell them where they can find things and occasionally ring them up. it's pretty simple.

martini glass is starting up soon. new members, new songs, should be pretty amazing.

i miss marching hurricanes so much already. this weekend was so weird, not seeing those people, not running the opener. i miss the daily dose. can't wait for next year.

stephany renee blanchard, chicago is real far away. october 18th - october 22nd, i want to fly out there. approve that so i can tell poppy to buy a plane ticket for my birthday. kthx.

i solemnly swear to update at least three times a week, if not more, from now on. it's good for my brain, so i should stop avoiding it. plus, it's the best way to keep robert sniffin updated on my life.
love, amanda.

with that said, today i went to wesconn and set up a payment plan for this coming semester and know they can't take away any of my classes and i can go to school and not worry about paying for school for at least another three months. so that's one thing that can stop pressing down on my chest and making my lungs feel like they are going to explode. i started at bath and body works on monday and i already hate it. but i need money ridiculously bad. so i'll keep training there. and i'll set up an interview with jo-ann's fabrics next week sometime. and when they offer me a job i'll figure out some way to leave bath and body works after two weeks without looking like a douche bag. which i'm sure is damn near impossible. whatever. i hate lotion. i like fabric. the end.

august 30th (late) through september 3rd (morning) i'll be in rochester, ny for DCA finals. get it hurcs colorguard, we're hot.
september 3rd (night) molly and i will be joining miss colleen hermann/love of my life in newbz 319 for the fall oh seven semester. ridiculousness will ensue.
september 4th classes start. that's crazy.

i can't wait for a chicken nugget salad in the upstairs cafe. <3

"event","So, things have been getting better fitness wise. I've got a concrete plan in place, and I""m feeling good about that. My goal is just 2lbs per week. That puts me at 40lbs down by Christmas, and at goal before School is out. Perfectly achievable. 

I checked out LA Weight Loss this last week.... great plan, but A- they don't talk about exercise at all, and frankly, tha thas to be part of a plan. B= it's over 1000! INSANE!
 
So lets see how the next week goes."

"event","Things have been going well. Monday's diet intake wasn't thebest, but it didn't kill me either. Yesterday was particularly good as far as choices go. I was heading back to school to help at Chris's party, and I was quite hungry. The only thing I could stop at on the way was a Carl's jr. I chose the fried zucchini, which while fried, is still a good veggie to eat (and they cut them thick, so that's good!) and filling, and is about 300 calories compared to over 400 in fries. Last night for Chris's date we went to McDonalds, but I stopped on the way and bought a subway chicken sub with plenty of veggies and some sunchips. I bought a diet coke at McDonalds,a nd it was good dinner. 
 
The working out is going well. I'm doing ball exercises every day. I'm up to sets of 20 on situps and oblique work, making for 60 situps a day, and then 20 to each side of an oblique stretch. I'm feeling the difference for sure. On weights I'm up to 25 of each exercise, doing a tricep extention, chest press, curls, bench press, fly, and some other exercise I don't know the name for :) 
 
In two weeks I'm getting a GOOD treadmill. My inlaws have one they don't use back in KS, and we're using it for a while. That has me excited, as I can put Zack in teh pack and walk with him. Go me, go me. It's also an exercise i can do right after surgery. 
 
I did my measurements last week, and I'm going to check them today. I don't expect to see major prgoress, as I still need to get teh water thing going. But-- Albertson's has packs of water for $.77 today, so we're getting 16 :) That should help!

QUICK UPDATE: I did the measurements- lost 6 3/4"" in the past week. Not too shabby!"

"event","Not too bad today! I had decent food intake, limited snacking, and had a huge serving of snap peas at dinner. Me loves the peas!
 
I realized that I've developed a liking for chocolate. Strange, because while I liked it before, I didn't crave it like I have since I became pregnant and had Zack. I know if I deny it, I'll cave to the great Reeses Monster later. So today I bought a thing of chocolate frozen yogurt from my Schwans guy. GOOD, and only 110 cals per serving! So tonight I had my 1/2 cup with a sliced banana. Delish. And totally knocked out the craving. 
 
Bought an exercise ball,a nd YAY! Came with exercises! So tomorrow morning I""m doing that. 

I'm off to bed- I plan on setting the alarm and getting up to work out. Wish me luck with that there plan."

"event","This is my biggest issue. I can't seem to find time for ANYTHING for myself. My online time is sandwiched with feeding Zack or the like. for instance, right now he's beside me in his walker, and I""m helping him with this octopus toy thing. Well, that and discouraging him from playing with the mouse. He likes to take down the mousepad AND mouse and run them around on his walker tray. Wierd kid. 
 
This morning I overslept, and all I' ve squeezed in are pushups, leg lifts, and some crunches. Zack doesn't nap, so that's not a solution either, and he goes to bed when I go to bed. Oklahoma and Winter havejust met up, so the walks in the park are out (42 degree temps plus winds up to 25 mph don't work for the baby). 
 
I'm getting frustrated. My goal at the moment is to fit into the next size down jeans in March, but I fear that is not going to happen."

"event","Well craptastic! I did my measurements last night and then accidentally deleted it all. Poo. I'll do those again today. They were *cough* high. 
 
It's set to be a busy day for me. Eric comes home, so I need to meet him at the airport at a bit after three. Before that I want to get the house all cleaned up. And of course I need to squeeze in an hour of Billy Blanks Tae Bo if at all possible. That might be difficult, so If necessary I'll break it into sections again. I can always take a nice brisk walk tonight as well. 
 
The hardest thing is finding time. Right now I'm sqeezing it in, but as soon as I'm done typing I have to take the dogs out and check the back fence- Maggie found a new place to escape. I need to get Zack up and changed and dressed. Then I'll need to fix Chris his breakfast and get him set on reading. I need to wash the dishes sice the dishwasher wonked out last night, I need to sort the laundry and hope Eric can fix the dryer this evening (didn't we just FIX that?), I need to sweep, vaccuum, and mop floors, change beds, and clean the bathroom. Plus the usual fixing of lunch, taking care of Zack, taking Chris to school, going to the bank hullabaloo. 

Busy Day!!!"

Thoughts on the day: 

I needed to choose better snack options in teh afternoon. It got a little out of control there. If it hadn't been for the extremely light dinner I'd planned, I would have been screwed. However, I am still significantly under for th day, even allowing for basic mistakes in measurement. So I am going ot treat myself later with a fudge pop :) I need to stay as close to 1800 as possible to keep my supply up. 
 
I need a multivitamin. I have some leftover prenatals. I'm going to take one tonight. I'll have it with at least 12 oz water which will get me closer to my goal water intake of 48oz. 
 
Exercise went well. It was broken into 2 sections (thighs in the am, arms and walk in the pm). I'm going to finish up befor ebed with crunches and leg lifts. I felt SO good after the walk. Must try and keep that up, though the pack was cumbersome. Until I get it fitted better I 'm going to stick with the stroller."

"event","Man, what a week it's been. I've been kind of mentally regearing... examining what I eat, when I eat it, looking for what it is that triggers my failures. It's boredom. Boredom is my biggest ""D'OH!"" Factor. So I'm going to try to, when Iget the urge to eat, make myself drink a 28oz glass of icewater first. We'll see how that goes. 
 
Eric is in MN this week, and that's good because I stocked the fridge with tons of veggies and other yum stuff. Lunch today will be a spinach salad. Dinner tonight will be an all veggie stirfry. 
 
Tonight- measurements and pictures! 

Today's inspiration-- 
We're going on this big float trip in July. It's on the Illinois river in Eastern OK, and it's  just one big party on the river. Lots of fun. Eric's former assistant *who was promoted* is coming back with his wife from Springfield, IL to go on it. It's m ostly people that Cliff and Eric play softball with and their wives. We've wanted to go the last few years, but last year I had a newborn, the year before our care for Chris fell through, and the year before that one of us was sick. 

In anycase, I definately want to be swimsuit ready for that weekend. So that's it- think July :)"

"event","Today, I had my epiphany. 
 
I went to Christopher's class to read, as i do every Tuesday. Afterwards, I went to wait in the car line to pick him up. I had twenty minutes to blow, and while waiting I found an old notebook stashed under a seat. Those things are always amusing, so I began to thumb through it.
 
Inside I found a letter I'd written to someone back in 2003, when I was in the middle of losing over 60lbs. Reading it was such an eye opener. I talked about clothes I'd just bought - the cute little Old Navy cargo jean shorts, the blue baseball style t-shirt in a guys small, the well fitted blue halter top. I talked about the five mile bike ride I'd taken that day to the park with Chris, and how i planned to go for a jog that night. 
 
It was just SUCH a kick in the pants. 
 
*I* am the person responsible for my health.
*I* am the only person who can take charge here. Not my family, not my doctor. *me*
 
So here we go.

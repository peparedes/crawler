"event","<font size=""2"">I had to start a new entry because the other one was getting too long....so yeah. Same rules still apply: read only if you don't care about spoilers.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Oliver!--1969&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/17/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Started out good i suppose...tho' i started watching side 2 first cause the dvd is labled wrong....stupid dvd...yeah...a little confused. anyway...liked the song about food and such...tho' there were alot of cheesy kids who were overacting...it was a little irritating...but whatever. oliver is just too cute. so gamine...is that the right word? either way....i liked all the sets/costumes...very nice. As far as the musical numbers went, i thought all of them were waaaaaay to long. Mostly because i got the point of what they were trying to say about 30 seconds into the song....and yet they all dragged on endlessly....repeating the same chorus again and again and again. give me a break and write something else for them to sing. I thought that Bill Sikes guy was a little creepy. especially when he opened the mail slot..ewwwww. and i couldn't decided whether i thought the artful dodger was cute or not? he's just like that girl in gigi....sometimes cute and other times not. but whatever....i didn't really understand why sometimes oliver would fight back and then other times he could be like the biggest wimp ever. stupid. i don't think that i would have wanted to live back then...just thinking about how dirty everone was gives me the creeps a little.....so dirty! bugs! no thanks. i like soap, thank you very much.&nbsp; watching them made me want to tell them to take baths or something....all of them were so filthy. yech. i suppose that i would watch this one again...probably not for awhile though.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Midnight Cowboy--1970&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/18/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I really am too spoiled. i don't think that i could live in squalor like that. too much of a princess. I wasn't sure what to think of John Voight as a hustler....i thought he was a little funny looking back then...he looked weird to me because i'm used to seeing the older john voight. so yeah. i wouldn't have payed him for any services rendered. ehh. even dustin hoffman looked a little weird to me....i dunno why....plus i kept getting rain man flashes. not to mention he is always really dirty looking in the movie....eww. take a bath man. i wonder how he hurt his foot? i can't remember if he mentioned it or not......either way.....i thought that the cinematography in this film was excellent. Very interesting to watch...plus i liked that they made all the flashbacks/dream sequences in black and white...i wonder if this was the first film to do that? hmh. i thought that the acting was very well done also. But i thought that the storyline got a little weird every once in awhile....mostly toward the end. but i think that was mostly around the drug induced party scenes....oh and by the way...that lady in the beginning...so NOT 28! she looked more like 38. and definitely not hot either. i did like that scene with the remote though. crafty. i dont't know that this is something i would or could watch on&nbsp;a regular basis though...too many things creep/bum me out. I was glad to have watched it tho'.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Patton--1971&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6/17/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Oh, jeez what a snoozefest. I really didn't want to watch this one.....and yeah i wasn't pleasantly surprised after watching it either....maybe this is just another godfather moment but i just didn't get this one. Boring! I think that the only reason this one won is because of the beginning and the acting of George C. Scott.....oh and maybe the music. but yeah....i just got bored watching this one...not to mention that Patton is an egoistical&nbsp;nut. He is crazy! You know i think that the war might have turned out differently had he been allowed to run free. I only say that because of that Nazi guy who knew everything about him, and was only stopped from helping because they didn't really listen to him. If they had they might have been able to win more of the battles. But i mean that's coming from someone who has no real idea&nbsp;about the actual history. Yeah...didn't really go that in depth in&nbsp;high school. And &nbsp;I'm not really sure how to feel about the whole coward thing....on the one hand i understand where that slap came from...on the other hand.....yeah. not so much. Anyway...i really don't think that i am going to be watching this one again. No, no no. Maybe only if tempted and bribed with money or ice cream.<br /><br /><strong>The French Connection--1972&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6/20/2007)<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uhhh....yeah. crazy gene hackman! what was going on with his character?! What a nut! crazy nut. i almost felt a little bad for roy schieder. anyway...this one tho' more interesting than patton, was a little boring too. It was nicely composed and had some nice lighting, and yet...it really wasn't enough for me to enjoy watching. Plus i didn't really like the way it ended...i mean well i liked that very end with the gunshot and blackout...but i didn't really like all those what-happened-to-who deal. I think that's mostly due to the fact that the one actor guy got the worst sentence out&nbsp;of all of them and he''s the one who participated the least. That just seems way too typical to me. Maybe it was a new idea back then, but when i see it now...i just think lame. Plus that other guy just got away...uh okay. Not to mention that gene hackman's character didn't even seem to get reprimanded for killing that Federal guy. I mean i know that he and his partner got taken of Narcotics cases but still...from the way that Fed guy was talking...it's not something he hadn't done before. I kinda saw him as a vigilante cop. Not to mention obsessive. But yeah.....by the middle i was kinda just waiting for the movie to end. I kinda got irritated watching that popeye doyle guy too. And how in the world was he able to pick up that chick on the bike? Sooo not hot. smooth talker maybe? i dunno. either way, ewww. And what was up with all the random shots of that hat in the back seat of their car?&nbsp; And please...that blood was sooo fake looking. way too orangey and watery. not to mention that when that guy got ""shot"" in that face in the beginning....not a very good special effects job. I know i sound kinda harsh...and have to take into consideration that it was made in the the early seventies...but still, c'mon. i did kinda like the train/car chase scene tho'. But all i kept thinking through that was...oh poor guy. Gene Hackman just went and totally fucked up your shit. That bastard.<br /><br /><strong>The Godfather--1973&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2005-i think)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Boys and their pseudo-masculine movies. ehh. i think that overall the story was interesting and all, but i still found it a little boring. maybe i didn't give it much of a chance or something? i dunno either way i really didn't see what the big deal was. not to mention that i thought Marlon Brando was going to be in the movie longer than he was.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>The Sting--1974&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6/24/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Oh, for daays robert redford. You know i actually found this one kinda boring. I mean i sorta already knew what was going to happen before it actually did. robert redford didn't even need to put those squibs in his mouth.....well okay i fell for that whole...female assassin thing, but everything else...seen it....maybe that's my problem....i've already seen this whole movie re-made and so nothing was a real surprise. i did like the song though...i wonder if it was written for this movie? huh...i'm supposing that it was...anywho...yeah...at about half way though i got antsy and was just waiting for the sting to happen already. i did like the various cutaways and the ending with the round closing shot...and i liked some of the lighting and the cinematography. i just didn't really see anything that would make me want to watch this one again. Well i mean besides robert redford and paul newman.<br /><br /><strong>The Godfather II-1975&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2005--right after #1)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Ditto for this one. Meeh.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest--1976&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1999--for an English Lit. Class)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I don't really remember much of this one...only that scene at the end where the indian guy is talking to a lobotomized jack nicholson. i think i mostly remember it as being weird and jack nicholson as being creepy. cause really he kinda is.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Rocky--1977&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sometime in the mid-90's)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>i think that the only thing i can remember about this one is why would adrian even want to get involved with a meathead like rocky? granted he's got a heart of gold...but still a meathead. i'm supposing it was lack of options...but i dunno. i mean i liked the movie. i though that the beginning was a little slow and boring...but overall i thought that it was good. i mean i actually like sylvester stallone.....i will admit to having seen most of his movies. even the specialist. yeah i know. bad. but whatever. i attribute that entirely to sharon stone.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Annie Hall--1978&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6/24/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>From the moment this started i was already dreading it...and i thought that it would be a nice brake from all the war and death....yeah not so much. i mean it totally had it's moments...parts of it i really liked....it's just all that incessant chattering. so not a fan of woody allen. That entire beginning monologue made me want to turn it off.....i really just don't see the attraction. i mean look at all those people that character hooked up with....so not for me. But then again they were all a little neurotic and unbalanced...so what does that say about him really. Still i do wonder if this one was the first to use first person perspective? that whole talking to the camera bit......i'm assuming that it was...but i'll research later. anywho...yeah...i really didn't think that any of his jokes were very funny either......so comedian? not so much. i did like how there was the internal monologue though...i wonder if this was the first one to do that too? at first i was a little confused about that cause i was watching with subtitles...so yeah. i also love that colleen dewhurst was in this. I love her! anne of green gables, you know. and christopher walken too...love him. i did like that whole split screen conversation at the dinner table and at the analysts office. I can see why this one won the best picture oscar..i just don't know if i&nbsp;want to&nbsp;get past woody allen to watch it again.<br /><br /><strong>The Deer&nbsp;Hunter--1979&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6/29/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Uh..yeah. not so much. i really do like christopher walken though. I...uh...i dunno. I really think that this one won just because it was about vietnam. it was good enough i suppose.....in terms off cinematography, lighting and story...i just....i don't know. I don't really feel any urge to watch it again...once was enough for me. maybe i would appreciate it more if it had had more of an impact on my life....i mean i wasn't even born yet. It did keep on giving me Miss Saigon flashes though.....i was listening to that the other day and i still think that chris guy was a selfish ass. It made me mad just listening to it....anyway...yeah that whole russian roulette thing...i really don't think that i could do that...scary! i was just wondering if there was a reason that they were all russian too? was it supposed to coincide with the whole roulette thing? You know...i was a little surprised that robert de niro's character waited that long to go back for him. i would have thought that he would have stayed there till he found him....especially since he promised. instead he waited what seemed like months...way too long. and he must have known what he was doing while he was there....i mean really. so that i didn't get. Plus i wasn't really sure what was going on with that whole meryl streep/robert de niro/christopher walken triangle.....she was obviously attracted to robert de niro and vice versa.....so yeah. i'm not sure how i feel about her and him hooking up when he gets back either....i mean i can understand the comfort thing....but really. isn't that sorta a&nbsp;betrayal? anyway...and yeah ohmigod the end! with the singing! i think that i would have liked the movie a whole lot more if it hadn't ended with the God Bless America. cheesy. and not in the good way. But then again i am not one of those uber patriotic people either...so yeah. either way...i really didn't see what the big deal was. but then i could say that about alot of the movies i've watched.<br /><br /><strong>Kramer Vs. Kramer--1981&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (mid-90's)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>i remember the part when the kid gets taken to the hospital. that's about it...oh and that meryl streep looked kinda old.....other than that....not much.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Ordinary People--1982&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7/5/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Uh......okay. yeah. Maybe i am just an insensitive bastard...but i kinda gotta say....and? i kinda felt&nbsp;like i was waiting two hours for the 5 lousy seconds at the end. this movie to me was just way too predictable and a little bit boring. maybe at the time it was an innovative breakthrough....but i was just kinda reminded of Good Will Hunting a little.....and i'm not really sure how i feel about the use of pachelbel's canon at the beginning of the film...or was it not a wedding song at the time? if not well then okay. i mean i do really like the song....but it's basically synonymous with weddings. anywho.....i really didn't like mary tyler moore's character in this film. what an unfeeling bitch...i really don't think that people like that should be allowed to have children. i mean they ultimately just screw them up anyway, and i totally felt major sympathy for the men in her life.....poor bastards. um....so yeah. bored. and i dunno...i wasn't really that moved by the whole discovery of why the son hated himself....maybe cause i knew what it was before he did. yeah you can tell that i've never really had any major tragedy in my life.....otherwise i don't think that i would be so blase about the whole thing.....at this point in my life i can't really help it. i am drama free. so yeah. really don't think that i will be watching this one again....maybe i will when i have a better ""life"" understanding of it all.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Chariots Of Fire--1983&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (mid-90's)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The song is the only thing i really remember from this one, and the beach running.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Ghandi--1983&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7/8/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I was very happy to find out that ben kingsley was at least half indian....cause otherwise it would have been black face all over again and that really would have been tragic. not to mention i think, a little bit insulting and degrading. anywho....yeah...i don't think that&nbsp;any of those other films nominated that year....E.T., Missing, Tootsie, The Verdict............had any real chance of winning...i mean&nbsp;were talking about&nbsp;Gandhi here. Not to say anything about richard attenborough's skills or anything but i mean really if you make any&nbsp;sort of effort and are backed with a considerable amount of money...there is no way that Gandhi could lose. Personally, i thought that the movie was okay. Cinematography-ok,&nbsp;acting was great...and i'm sure that helped....but overall...okay. I&nbsp;actually got a little bored toward the middle&nbsp;end of the whole thing....maybe i would have liked it more if i was more aware of Gandhi's teachings....but i really don't have any idea except for the whole non-violence thing and the fasting....plus&nbsp;being ignorant of history i kinda didn't like that they didn't&nbsp;explain why that guy shot him....i'm thinking that maybe it was a muslim? but i&nbsp;dunno. i also didn't really&nbsp;like that the&nbsp;years went by so&nbsp;vaguely. it was always a few years&nbsp;later, a few months later, etc.&nbsp;plus that whole beginning scene where he gets shot...had a&nbsp;weird sort of&nbsp;feeling for me.....almost like it was anti-climatical or something......i dont' really know how to explain.......anyway...yeah. i can see why this one won...i just&nbsp;don't think it's one of those i really want&nbsp;to watch again.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Terms Of Endearment--1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7/9/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>uHmmmm...yeah. I suppose that i liked it.i dont' really know what to say about this one....i mean....hmh. Her getting sick at the end was a little surprising....it almost felt...i dunno. i found it a little weird. i did really like that scene where she was telling her kids that she wasn't going to be around anymore though. I hope that if my kids are that young and i'm dying, that our conversation can be so candid. plus i like that she told her oldes that it was okay to not feel guilty. That's the only part in the movie that i really got all teary. I did really like jack nicholson's character too...he was charming in a kooky/kind creepy way. and man shirley mcclaine's character was such a nut..i mean you could tell that from the beginning when she makes the daughter cry....The relationship between the mother and daughter was a little new for me.....cause my mom's not really that kind. so, yeah. it was nice to see that they had such a great relationship...and i did really like that part where the daughter says that they don't fight all the fime...it's just that the mom is never satisfied with her. i laughed. anyway yeah....so i dunno. i suppose that i can see why it won....it had great acting in it...and i liked the overall cinematography.....i dunno...i suppose i could see myself watching it again...if i was in the right mood. Man, i kinda feel that all the movies i've been watching lately have been such a downer. so serious and everyting.....sigh.<br /><br /><strong>Amadeus--1985&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1992?) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I remember loving this movie! and hating what's his name...the guy who was trying to steal Mozart's work.....well whatever....Mozart was a genius! an idiot but a genius.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Out Of Africa--1986&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7/21/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Meeh. It was okay. It reminded me a little of Planet Earth....so i suppose that i liked it for the cinematography....other than that...i dunno. i was a little thrown off by meryl streph's accent...and that i couldn't really see myself getting married to my friend like that....weird. anywho...yeah...i dunno what to say really...i was a little bored by the whole thing....it was good enough. anyway....the only part that i was really moved by was when she said that she wanted to hear that guy speak her name....i teared a little then....but that's it...and i'm not really sure if agree with that whole we don't belong to anyone thing.....i can see how that makes sense and how it doesn't. Either way...i don't really have any pressing urge to watch this one again...i do admire that lady for living in a man's world and surviving....but....i don't need to be watching it on a regular basis.<br /><br /><strong>Platoon--1987&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7/23/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>um....yeah...i kinda feel the same way about all war movies....good but not something i like to watch on a regular basis. i don't think that being as young as i am and as untouched as war as you can get...be able to fully appreciate war movies...i mean i haven't and don't know anyone who has died or been sent to war. so not a personal subject. anyway...as far as this movie goes...i knew that barnes was going to kill......willem defoe's charcter...tho' i&nbsp;wasn't sure if&nbsp;chris was going to kill barnes....that was a little surprising....i also didn't really like when that guy.....the black guy who fell asleep on duty....was okay with the raping...but not with the murdering.....that just seemed a little hypocritical to me.....like one isn't as wrong as the other or something....i'm glad that scene wasn't too graphic..i think seeing that sort of thing is more traumatizing to me than seeing someone dying. I suppose that's cause i've seen millions of people die on screen...some of them have even made me laugh...which thinking about now, really shouldn't be that funny. anyway....i did like that one part in the end where it goes from black and white to color..and i did like the cinematography. The acting was great too....and it was nice seeing johnny depp. Watching this movie made me really glad that i've never lived in a country torn by war...all those poor people. innocent bystanders really. i think that i felt sorry for them the most....it also made me realize that i don't really know why those troops had to be sent to vietnam in the first place...that could just be because of my sadly lacking education tho'. we weren't taught much in the way of history. <br /><br /><strong>The Last Emperor--1988&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7/27-29/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>It took me three days to finish watching this one....for daaaaaaays! ohmigod! 3 3/4 hours is just waaaaaaaaaaaay too long. i....i.....i dunno....it was just too long. i almost couldn't stand it. what is it with all these uber long epic movies?! i swear even thought this second list of movies is shorter in terms of the number that i still have to watch, i think it's taking me the same amount of time to watch them as i did with the first set....i think cause it's filled with movies that are waaaay too long and of a subject matter that just utterly depresses me. it almost makes it too hard to appreciate. anywho....i can see why this one won i suppose..i mean the costumes and sets and cinematography are fantastic...and the acting is great too. i just kinda see this one as another gandhi though...i mean how is it going to lose really? i mean they obviously had loads of money. so yeah...that little boy in the beginning is just too too cute. he kinda reminded me of one of my friends kids. though what was with that lady wet-nursing him for that long? weird, twisted and disturbing. anywho...other than this one being too long....i had kinda wanted to see it with the dialogue in chinese....was it actually filmed that way and i just watched a dubbed version? it that's the case...well that's my bad...but if that's how it's filmed...well that's just plain stupid. i prefer the subtitles to the dubbing...just like i prefer widescreen to p&amp;s......they really shouldn't make p&amp;s anymore...i think it's retarded. anywho....i really don't see myself watching this one again...not even if someone else wanted too....and it doesn't really make me want to see any of the director's other films. i did think that the actor who played the adult emperor was very attractive though...and it was fun to see those other actors from one of my favorite movies of all time...Big Trouble in Little China. i love that show.<br /><br /><strong>Rain Man--1989&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1989--maybe)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>you can forget about tom cruise...this movie is all about Dustin Hoffman. he's great in this movie.....i can totally see tom cruise playing himself in this one. either way...i suppose i liked it.....the movie had it's moments.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Driving Miss Daisy--1990&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7/30/2007)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Meeh. didn't really see what the big deal was. it was okay...some parts i laughed out loud...<br /><strong>Dances With Wolves--1991&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1991)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>yeah like we really want to see your butt again Kevin Costner.....put that thing away. ewww. no thank you! i did really like this movie though. it had it's good parts and i liked it on a historical level too. i think that&nbsp;i like it more for the indian chief than kevin costner though.&nbsp;<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Silence Of The&nbsp;Lambs--1992&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1998?)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Uh, okay. Anthony Hopkins was good and i liked that guy who was making the body suit. i think i liked this one mostly because i was a murder mystery involving serial killers. i have a strange fascination with them, don't really know why but&nbsp;i really just can't help it. i suppose it's because they do things that i could never ever do....maybe?<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Unforgiven--1993&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1998?)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Uh, western with clint eastwood...that 's all i really remember.

You don't know how long i had it sitting by my dvd player! For daaaaays! ahhhh! I thought that it was going to be alot more depressing than it was....but it was a lot tamer than i though it was going to be....i think that just comes from seeing soooo much violence already....you know....i mean i even said it before.....the fact that seeing someones head get blown off doesn't really jar me as much as it should.....i've become desensitized to a certain degree. And while the whole thing is horrific...i kinda viewed it with a certain..i dunno...detachment. The only time that i got really teary eyed was at the end when schindler breaks down and when&nbsp;you got to see all the actual survivors and their acting counterparts. That part touched me, that he was able to save so many people is astounding itself. I mean this is another one of those epic movies that was basically ensured the oscar......i don't think that other movies even had a chance. The story was great and the acting too....and oh black and white! i love you! Except throughout the whole movie...i kept thinking how long it must have taken them to set up all that lighting.....it must have taken forever! i love limn lighting by the way... i think it's my favorite. But i think the reason i liked this movie that most is because of the lighting and the cinematography.....and it's not something that i would want to watch often....i think it would just depress me. I can and do appreciate it for what it is though. Oh i did like that little effect with the girls dress tho' and finding out later that it was actually one of Schindler's personal memories.....at first i was a little put off by it...i think i just hate things where kids are spotlighted in that way....i mean i can understand why....well kinda....i think i would understand more it i actually had kids. but anyway it was made more poignant for me by knowing it was an actual memory.<br /><br /><strong>Forrest Gump--1995&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1995)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>you would not believe how many times this movie is quoted to me because my name is Jenni. so not funny anymore. and it anyone ever used that as a pick up line they are basically dead where they stand. Still i did really like this movie. it was cute and interesting how they were able to incorporate Forrest's life with actual history. i never really liked robin wright penn as jenny though....i don't know why. she just irked me for some reason.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>Braveheart--1996&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I have the soundtrack to this movie...mostly because i like that one song that has the bagpipe playing. I think it's just that funeral song though....plus i like that one girls theme song too. Anywho...i like this one. Even though it has Mel Gibson in it an all....but then he never really bothered me that much...even now. I mean i know he's a little crazy...but that doesn't seem to affect his movie making skills. I thought this one was a good movie all around...story-good, cinematography-good, costumes-good. acting-good too. Violence, didn't bother me. I only say that because even though all his movies are uber-violent...it's realistic to me, cause that's probably how it really was back whenever. The Patriot...that was the only one i didn't really like...and well never saw Passion so....yeah. Anyway....I know i probably cried while watching this and will probably yet again when i watch it for a refresher...can't help myself...i'm easy like that.<br /><br /><strong>The English Patient--1997&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8/16/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Meeh. I dont' think that i am going to watch this one again.....i mean...i dunno. it was good i suppose. I did like all the parallel scenes&nbsp;in the film...which actually escape me now......oh like that one where juliette binoche and naveen andrews are kissing and it's matched with ralph finnes and kristin scott thomas......well i think you know what i mean if you've seen the film...other than that....well i suppose that i liked the cinematography too....the story was interesting...thought i didn't think that it really needed to be that long. And i've never really been a believer in commiting adultery soo....yeah. not so much.&nbsp;i dunno i just wasn't really impressed by this one.....even now i am having difficulty remembering and i just watched it this morning......i did think throughout tho' that ralph finnes was i dunno.......a little creepy seeming. I really don't know what it is....but his character just seemed a little odd. Even juliette binoche's character seemed a little loony...but i suppose that everyone she loved dying had a little to do with that.....that's enough to make anyone a little mad. Willem Dafoe is always nice to see.....and i usually enjoy seeing him in whatever he does. Ehh. i think i need to find out what else was up that year...just to see if i think this was the best.<br /><br /><strong>Titanic--1998&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1998)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I know your going to think i'm uber-lame...but i actually like the titanic. Yeah i know. i even like the celine dion song.....sadder yet. i think it i recall correctly i saw this one at least twice while in theatres. I though this one was great all around too...good acting, cinematography, sets, special effects, etc. Plus i really do kinda like my friend&nbsp;Billy Zane. If you've never seen the phantom, watch it-it's a hoot. Anywho...yeah i after watching this one i even wanted one of those heart diamond necklaces....yeah i know. shut up! i even liked the way the movie ended...it was circuitous. (real word? ehh). <br /><br /><strong>Shakespeare In Love--1999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1999)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>A movie i actually liked Ben Affleck in.<br /><br /></font><font size=""2""><strong>American Beauty--2000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2000)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Oh, movie. really like this one....lots of different reasons. i think mostly because kevin spacey's character goes through that crazy mid-life crisis. working on the guns, blackmailing his boss, smokin' the weed--crack me up. didn't really care to much for mena suvari or thora birch to much though. Wes bentley is a little hottie however.<br /><br /><strong>Gladiator--2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2001)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Eh, good the first time you watch it...but i don't really feel a pressing urge to watch it again. I think this is one of those boy movies again. i mean yeah...the story is interesting, but i don't really think that russell crowe is all that hot. so i mean really. i did think that the end with the little boy walking out with Maximus' body a little overboard...i mean isn't he a little too young to be picking him over his uncle? yeah i dunno. plus i really don't think that Maximus would have liked this family being buried in the arena like that....i mean couldn't you go find a nice field somewhere? really.<br /><br /><strong>Beautiful Mind--2002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8/19/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Meeh. That's kinda what i gotta say...meeh. I mean it was good and i really like Jennifer Connelly, but eh. It was inspiring in the sense that it was based on actual events. Plus i do like Paul Bettany....he's got this weird charm that i find appealing. Watching this movie made me a little sad that i wasn't more brilliant. so not...oh well. Um.....i dunno..i really didn't like seeing Adam Goldberg in this movie...just cause his character is the same in all the movies he plays....the neurotic crazy type who like to talk with his hands and speaks in high pitched tones. So definitely not my favorite Ron Howard movie. I dont' really have any desire to watch it again. so yeah. that baby was really really cute tho'. umhmh....<br /><br /><strong>Chicago--2003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2003)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Renee Zellweger..........waaay to pale in this movie. what a whitey. <br /><br /><strong>Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King--2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2004)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>i remember liking fellowship alot more than this one.<br /><br /><strong>Million&nbsp;Dollar Baby--2005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8/20/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Um. yeah. i guess. I was liking it in the sports movie sense.....but not so much. i dunno.....that whole end thing is just a bit jarring and i dunno...i know it's not really important but i would have liked to know if anything happened to that girl who paralyzed her. anywho. it just seemed so contrived and typical...and i dunno. boring. boring. boring. boring. probably won't be watching this one again....ever. i kinda felt that the end of the movie was when she broke her spinal cord...the whole feel of the movie changed for me then...it turned from a sports movie to one you would watch on the lifetime channel. plus i'm not sure if i agree with the whole aided suicide thing.....on the one hand i do...and on the other i don't. so i dunno. i did find it a little cheesy that clint eastwoods character ended up at that pie place. yeah....like you didn't know that was going to happen. umhmh. not to mention morgan freeman's character getting his 101th fight....yeah. whatever.<br /><br /><strong>Crash--2006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8/24/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Ohmigod! What a bunch of racist assholes....that's really all that i kept thinking in my head. Jesus. i just really don't know what to make of racists...i mean maybe i am too trusting or something....but people like that just irritate me....and i don't think that i've ever really met someone who was like that....well i probably have but i just didn't realize it....but yeah. This movie just kinda irritated and sickened me...i mean really people do you really need to be acting that way to someone....i suppose i just don't understand seeing as how i grew up in hawaii.....one of the most racially diverse places ever....if your an asshole it has nothing to do with the color of your skin....it may have a little to do with your class...so i guess that makes me a classist (real word? ehh.) than anything.but yeah people are idiots. big idiots. this one isn't epic or anything but with all that 9/11 what's not going on, i'm not at all surprised that it won for best picture....it's another of those ghandi moments...what like it's not going to win? so yeah......the only real sad part of the movie for me was when ryan phillippe's character shot that guy. idiot. stupid stupid man.so anyway it was a good movie....but i really don't need to be spending anymore time watching idiots at work. racists are evil bigots and i hope that they all get what is coming to them. jerks.<br /><br /><strong>The Departed--2007<br /></strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>"

"event","<p><font size=""2"">If you wanted to watch any of these i wouldn't read any of this. Just a spoilers alert.<br />I've decided to write a journal about my thoughts on the films i've been watching. Starting with......<br /><br /><strong>Wings--1929&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5/17/2007--Estimated Viewing Date, at least until 1937, then it's actual)</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't get a chance to watch this one because it's not available on dvd. And since videos are pretty much obsolete....yeah.............but i am magical and happened to find a copy of it on video. It was a little too long....i mean i can only watch the same planes be shot down so many different ways you know......still i mean considering it was filmed back in the 1920's it's pretty amazing. And of course all the actors/actresses are attractive cause what else do you have to go on but looks seeing as how it's a silent film. It was a little&nbsp;cheesy but i kinda expected that...all the exclamation points and such...i laugh...outloud a few time too. David's bear was just too cute, so lil' anyway....i wasn't really expecting him to die....i mean i was after he forgot his bear...but i didn't really expect Jack to shoot him down. oh well.....it was an accident. Oh and that part in paris with all the bubbles. no no no...i got really really bored at that part...i mean you can only watch jack go after so many bubbles...and oh! riske little clara bow! naked! i really didn't think that they were going to be showing that...scandalous.....not to mention the almost gay vibes at the end when david is dying.....i think that has more to do with the fact that boys were more comfortable with each other because the possibility that they were gay was pretty much non-existent at the time. very hush-hush. Though i didn't think it was fair that she's the one that had to get sent home...i mean really. she wasn't even doing anything. stupid pervy boys. oh i did like that one scene in the beginning when david and sylvia are on the swing and you can see jack coming in the background. overall i suppose that it was okay but i don't really feel a pressing urge to watch it again.<br /><br /><strong>Broadway Melody--1930&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1/19/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh. Almost feel asleep watching this one, and the special features were even worse. Meeh. Story wise it was okay i suppose. If you think that personal sacrifice is the way to go anyway. Basically this cute, tough lady is in a duo act with a dumb, innocent ""hottie"" that everyone falls in love with. Their trying to hit it big in NY as a duo act. The singing was terrrrrrible. Not suprising though seeing as how most of the actors/actresses at this time weren't being hired for their singing experience. Anyway yeah. Tough ladys boyfriend helps them get into the business, and falls for the hottie, who is also being pursued by this rich smarmy playboy type guy that wants to make her his mistress.Tough lady knows that guy is bad news and tries to keep hottie away from him, with the help of her bf. Climactic finish where the tough lady lets the bf go and rescue the hottie from smarmy playboy, knowing that the BF is in love with hottie and fully intends to marry her. After which she still remains friends with both....yeah. i can't really see anyone doing that. You would have to be one hell of a giver.<br />I did think that some of the scenes were a bit racy considering the year.....hanging around in their undergaments and taking baths. etc. etc. overall i thought the film was okay. By today's standards i don't think that i could call it a Best Picture Oscar winner tho'. Makes me wonder how the other pictures nominated that year were in comparison.<br /><br /><strong>All Quiet On the Western Front--1931&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1/26/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This one was better than the previous one, but i personally think that most of the reason it won is because of the closing shot of the film. Very dramatic. Tragically pretty really. Story was good i suppose....a guy (and his entire class) are......talked into believing that going off to fight in the war is an uber&nbsp;noble, fantastic terrific idea of fun and games. Of course, he is entirely misguided and finds out later what life in the army is really like after watching everyone he knows being killed. He is later injured and allowed to go home on leave. He goes home to find that he doesn't fit anymore and his teacher brainwashing a new bunch of innocent minds. He tries to tell them the truth about war, and they won't listen. He returns to the fight, where he dies an inevitable death, while reaching for a butterfly.<br />I thought that the cinematography was good tho' and the acting fairly well done.&nbsp; i dunno. it was okay.<br /><br /><strong>Cimarron--1932&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2/1/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; I like watching these old historical movies because you can learn things about the past that you might have been unaware had happened. I for example didn't know that a woman had been nominated to the senate as early as 1930. Unless of course that didn't happen? i dunno u guess that i'll have to do some research. anyway this movie is about a family being a part of the huge movement west and the building of new territories.&nbsp;I was a little bothered that the wife put up with the husband and his wandering ways. But i suppose that's how it is when you love someone....not to mention that women thought quite differently back then, Overall movie was okay. Don't know if i would want to watch it again tho'.<br /><br /><strong>Grand Hotel--1933&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2/15/2007)</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just plain irritated by that ballerina lady. Ech! Everytime she came on screen i got all kinds of agitated. What a princess. Not to mention that terrible accent. This one was okay too. I was a little suprised to see how easily uh....count something (sorry can't remember his name) was killed though, it didn't look like he had gotten hit very hard. Either way the idea of him falling in love with that diva ballerina in just one night. You know all the movies so far seem to have all the same theme. Grab life anyway you can and live it to the fullest. I suppose you can say that idea is still true today. The cinematography was okay. i really only remember liking the lighting and the one shot placed high and looking down into the lobby. <br /><br /><strong>Cavalcade--1934&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (TBD)<br /><br /><br />It Happened One Night--1935&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2/19/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This is the first movie that i actually really liked. I could see myself watching this one again. Overall very well done. I liked the lighting, acting and story. I didn't like to find out that Claudette Colbert was such a princess tho', that sort of killed my buzz a little, cause up until then i had liked her very much. I was still suprised to find out how much her father had payed that other guy off with though. so much money! Even now that a lot. $100,000.00 Crazy. Clark Gable is such a manly man's man. But i suppose that sort of works for him....i don't know who i would compare him with now? Hhmh...maybe a mix with George Clooney and....i dunno someone else.<br /><br /><strong>Mutiny on the Bounty--1936&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2/25/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This one i think i fell asleep watching the first time. It was interesting from a historical standpoint but that's about it. I really didn't know what to think about the portrayal of the native people.....hmmh. well okay. anyway. yeah. Overall i think that it won because of some great acting, exotic locations&nbsp;and the special effects. other than that i dunno.<br /><br /><strong>The Great Ziegfeld--1937&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3/4/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This one was very elaborate and crazy! Especially that one spinning set with all the pretty ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp;I really liked that one part with the balloon, and moving beds&nbsp;too. How nifty! I think that if i had been married to him though i would have gone crazy. What a ridiculous spender. Still he did produce some very splendid things. I really didn't like his first wife, anna either. She reminded me too much of that nutty ballerina in Grand Hotel. Crazy foreign ladies. Actually i didn't really&nbsp; like the actress who played her either...she seemed a little, i dunno, loopy. I did however like his second wife......i forget her name though....she seemed to support him in ways that he really needed. Oh i also didn't know that song...i think it's the On the sunny side of the street.....was so old. I had always wondered where that song had come from..even though i only know the very end. I did think it was funny how he made that weightlifter into a female attraction though. Oh come and feel the enormous muscles of The Great Sandow! Hilarious. It is a really long movie though an although i enjoyed parts of it, i don't know if i wanna watch the entire movie again. I would probably just skip to the parts that i like.<br /><br /><strong>The Life of Emile Zola--1938&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3/7/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This one i think i have liked least of all so far. How boring. Snoozefest! I found myself in the middle wondering if i need to file my nails. Historically it was interesting to learn but it just seemed kinda trite and overrated. One of the things i can't seem to get past is the speech that Zola makes to the jury. Only because in it he mentions Captain Dreyfus at least half a dozen times and yet is not reprimanded by the judge for speaking of him.&nbsp;Obviously the director wanted to get an impassioned speech about truth and&nbsp;justice and i just might have bought it if&nbsp;Zola's attorney hadn't been reprimanded for speaking of the captain numerous time before.&nbsp;Wasn't any mention of mr. dreyfus to be inadmissable as evidence to the jury? yeah. anyway. other than that the only scene that i really liked was the one shot outside of the courthouse when it was raining and you see that tops of all the umbrellas. <br /><br /><strong>You Can't Take It With You--1939&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3/11/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This one was cute. that frank capra. I think that i am going to watch all his other films now. even the ones not on the best picture list. This one i thought had a good story and interesting actors. it kept me entertained. i think that has to do with the fact that it seemed like it could have been made not as long ago as it had been. i don't know if i explained that right but it just feels that way.....i dunno. Either way i liked it. I even laughed out loud a few times and it did make me want to live in a house with people who had free spirits. Oh and i did like how it seemed that the two black people in the house were more like family than servants. It was a nice change from Cimarron where they were treated with less respect. I mean i know that in this movie they were viewed as servants but it wasn't in a derogatory way. So far i am not regretting this little foray into classical movies, i just hope it only gets better from here.<br /><br /><strong>Gone With The Wind--1940&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3/12/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like i was on a movie watching role so i decided to watch. The first thing i really noticed about this one was the soundtrack. For some reason i can't remember the other movies having a soundtrack that played through out the entire thing. Oh and well i noticed the color too cause that was also a first. What i want to know is what is up with all these ridiculous heroes and heroines that act all crazy? That scarlett O'hara is a nut. Crazy, spoiled nut. Throughout the whole movie i kept wondering what idiotic thing she would do next. It does make me want to at least skim the book to see how it translated to the screen. But yeah. okay. It was a good movie i suppose, but not necessarily something that i could watch very often. For one, waaaay too long. Two, that scarlett would drive me crazy, not to mention just about everyone else in the film. Too many quirky odd folk. It didn't really give me any sympathy for the old southern folk&nbsp;either. Even now. Not a place i would ever live. No thank you. It was an interesting movie i suppose but&nbsp;for the last hour and a half or so i would keep&nbsp;checking to see how much&nbsp;longer i had to endure. Good for Rhett Butler for finally moving on though. I just hope that if&nbsp;he ever did&nbsp;go back, it's because Scarlett made some huge gesture. Doubtful, but i'm hopeful. I did like the cinematography though--all those dramatic&nbsp;high contrast outline shots. Oh and i did really like scarlett's green and white dress that displayed her bosoms improperly.&nbsp;You know for some reason i thought that somebody&nbsp;got raped in this movie....i don't know where i got that idea but i'm glad it didn't happen.&nbsp;Don't like watching things like that....i&nbsp;always have to fast forward that part in the Messenger.&nbsp;Icky. I thought it was cute too see&nbsp;Mammy wearing those red knickers tho', and that fact that she loved them so much.<br /><br /><strong>Rebecca--1941&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3/15/2007)<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hhmmhh. well...........i had actually heard about this book but hadn't known that it was also a movie. I didn't really know what the book was about either...it was only mentioned in passing&nbsp; as someone quoted from it. Anyway,The story i liked...it had one of those twists at the end that i was slightly surprised by. I also liked the lighting and the composition in the movie. The only one that i really remember now is the part in the very beginning and you get your first look at Manderley in the background and the branches in the foreground. Me likey. Oh,&nbsp; and i did like the part where Maxim is re-telling the night of Rebecca's ""accidental"" murder. yeah. The whole movie did remind me of some trashy historical romance novel though, but without all the steamy sex scenes. I didn't really like how domineering Maxim acted toward she who didn't even have a name. What's with the no name anyway? i dunno, i suppose i could read the book to find out. But yeah i think that whole attitude just came from being rich and well off. and worldly i suppose. Still, if i was her i don't think that i would have liked it very much. But who's to say really....anyway I figured that i was going to like Rebecca, cause&nbsp;I liked all the other Hitchcock movies that i have seen and am going to try and watch the rest. BTW that Mrs. Danvers is a nut. Crazy crazy nut. um-hmh.<br /><br /><strong>How Green Was My Valley--1942&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3/18/2007)<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good and not so good at the same time. I thought that it started out really really boring in terms of story, and then it would get better and then worse and then better. Overall i liked it i suppose. I really enjoyed the cinematography though. Lots of very nicely composed shots. The only part that i really would have wanted to see in color was that scene on the hill with all the daffodils. uhm. yeah. I am actually starting to recognize some of the actors and actresses too, which is a little nice. I think that my favorite scene is the one right after the daughter is married and you get to see her veil flying....i really don't know wny these movies are filled with people doing things that they don't really want too. Is that just a human nature thing? i dunno but either way it kinda bugs me. so yeah. got a little bored watching this one and don't think that i would watch it again, but i at least can appreciate it for it's asthetics.</font></p><p><font size=""2""><strong>Mrs. Miniver--1943&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3/21/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I didn't think that i was going to like this one at all, it seemed like it was going to be an utterly depressing movie about war, so i put off watching it for as long as i could. I actually liked it though. mr. and mrs. miniver are sooooo cute together.&nbsp;..i mean sooooooooooo cute. Seemed almost like an ideal relationship....but i would have to insist on one bed, not two singles. lol. The kids i didn't really like so much. The little girl was kinda boring and the little boy was just irritating. Not to mention that the oldest kept giving off gay vibes. i really had a hard time believing he was straight. I did like that girl he married tho'. She was cute, i didn't expect that she was the one that was going to die....but i guess i should have. In retrospect it was kinda of obvious with all the clues they were throwing around. Anyway, i also hadn't expected Mr..........the guy who grew the rose....i forget his name. but i didn't expect him to die either. how lame...i guess they had to kill him off after giving him that award for his Mrs. Miniver. I really liked the actress that played Mrs. miniver too. cute. i was really kinda grossed out when that nazi guy put that ham in his pocket. Eww. a Hammy pocket. gross. i wonder if she really believed that she was helping him out by calling the police...i kinda assumed that they were taking him off to his death...but that's just me. i did think that the last shot was a nice job of framing tho. oh and i really didn't like her hat.<br /><br /><strong>Casablanca--1944&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3/25/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>That rick what a smart-aleck. i can see why you would like him steven.....hmh. I knew that this movie was very much quotted and such but i&nbsp; guess that i never realized how much. Plus i didn't know that that song was from this movie either ""As time goes by"". i like that song. So many of these movies have songs that i recognize.....so old. didn't really know&nbsp;what this movie was&nbsp;about so&nbsp;i didn't know what to expect either....huh.............to be continued...........okay..uhhhhhhhhhh. Yeah well that sucks. poor rick alllllllll alone. okay well not really all alone but who'd really want to be spending all their time with that police guy. oh and by the way how could he just leave all his other friends behind like that? that seemed a little crazy too me. well at least they'll be taken care or i suppose. oh well. anyway. life sucks sometimes doesn't it. it all seems to be about being the right place at the right time. I always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. *sigh* anywho liked the cinematography and the story and such.<br /><br /><strong>Going My Way--1945&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/2/2007)<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i thought that this one was going to be a welcome change from all the depressing war movies that i've had to watch lately, but no. not really. Boooooooooooring! and excuse me but that song kinda sucked. i wouldn't have wanted to play it one the radio either. i really don't understand why this one won best picture! there must have been a lot of stinkers that year. and what's with that one guy hitting his friend in the face so many times? i would have slugged him one right back! jerk. so um yeah. i never really ever got behind that whole turning delinquents into singing angels thing. but i suppose back in the day when there was nothing better to do, it's a plausible idea. i mean i did like&nbsp;Les Choristes&nbsp;and that's pretty much that same thing. still i feel kinda sorry for bing crosby's character...i mean having to keep moving around and fixing things and leaving all your new friends behind again and again. that sucks. oh i did get a little teary though when he brought the other priests mom around as a surprise. tho' i was kinda shocked to see she was still alive. ooooooooooold. so yeah. never again.<br /><br /><strong>The Lost Weekend--1946&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/1/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I almost fell asleep watching this one.......a few times. Storywise, i guess that i just didn't get it. Maybe that makes me an unsympathetic bitch but i kinda just got tired of watching this guy and his issues. I never really understood people and their addictions anyway. At least not to the point where you would steal, lie&nbsp;and treat&nbsp;people like shit to satisfy a certain craving. So to that extent i really didn't have any sort of sympathy for him and his problem. Great girlfriend though. I wonder if the end of the movie really was the end of his problem or if it was just a good moment in his vicious circle.....i dunno, i hope for the girlfriends sake that he was being sincere. i couldn't figure out where i had seen her before and then i realized that she's the aunt in Pollyanna. Hmh. anyway i did like the cinematography in the movie though. very nice.<br /><br /><strong>The Best Years of Our Lives--1947&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/4/2007)<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put off watching this one too. but it wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be. nice cinematography and i liked the story i suppose....oh and i couldn't figure out where i'd seen that girl from before and then i realized that she was in Mrs. Miniver.....well at least she didn't die this time. anyway.....it wasn't as depressing as i thought it was going to be. none of the men became like homeless or jobless. so i think this was the candy coated version of things after the war. but still hmh i dunno. i really dont' know what to say....uh. yeah. old guy with the nice wife. drunken idiot at first.....finally gets his act together...uh homer the disabled one...well good for him that he picked a great girl. happiness. and as far as the other guy well.....eh. good for him that he met a nice girl, even though he wasn't the one that demanded the divorce. so yay to his ex-wife for sticking to her selfish guns. that marriage would have sucked for both of them.<br /><br /><strong>Gentleman's Agreement--1948&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/8/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I guess that i never really realized that there was such an anti-semitism movement in america. I know that there was Hitler and all his craziness over in Europe but i dunno....it was a surprise anyway. Disliking Jewish people seems a little weird to me....i can more understand people disliking black folk because at least there&nbsp;was a physical difference.....not that that makes it any better, but it seems more likely to me than the anti-semitism thing. So this whole movie i dunno....i guess i just can't understand it cause i never really had to deal with that sort of thing. People in hawaii are fairly laid back, at least in reference to me, so the racism thing never really hit home. anyway gregory peck....what a hottie. i really liked how he flirted with his eyes..it was cute. and dean stockwell?! so little. he was so cute back then. i wonder what happened. oh and i like how he was eating grape nuts in the beginning...grape nuts so old. who knew. anywho....liked the story, and the cinematography oh and the hat. i think that it's sad that people don't wear hats anymore....as like a part of their daily outfit. Oh and the love scene in the beginning was&nbsp;the most amorous one that i have seen so&nbsp;far....i mean THREE urgent embraces?! Scandalous! Tee-Hee. i laugh. i really liked the fashion editor too, she was so saucy. mmhmh. While i liked that movie i don't know if i would want to watch it again....once you know what's going to happen then i think it would be a little boring and then&nbsp;all i would be doing is getting irritated at&nbsp;all the small minded idiot people. so yeah not&nbsp;so much. I&nbsp;do think that they're right about the whole children thing though....stupid people raise stupid childen&nbsp;and there are way too many stupid people in the world. We are doomed.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Lawrence Olivier's Hamlet--1949&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/9/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Oh Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Could this movie have been any longer?! I don't think so. It was the movie that would never end. Ugh! Not to mention that the old english was kinda hard to understand what with all the mumbling and incoherent ramblings. Plus i thought that Laurence Olivier was overacting and hamming it up, and yet was still able to win the Best Actor Oscar.Uhmhmh.. so not looking forward to Lawvence of Arabia. I could kinda understand the Best director award cause i liked the cinematography and the big old set...though it was a little too bare i thought. I did really like that one seen where Ophelia is looking down that long corridor at Hamlet, who you can see really far away. And then the point of view switches to hamlet...nice. I also liked that long shot at the very end and the continuous one that happens while they are all watching the play.&nbsp;OOoh! I was&nbsp;just wondering though why the queen even drank that poisoned wine? She obviously knew what it was soooooooo? yeah stupid. Oh and was Laertes gay? I keep getting that vibe from&nbsp;him in the end......i&nbsp;dunno. Either way&nbsp;I am not going to be&nbsp;watching this one again if i can&nbsp;help it. no thanks.<br /><br /><strong>All The King's Men--1950&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/11/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Meeh. I wasn't really expecting anything from this one. Not so much. Seeing it doesn't make me want to watch the remake either. Meeh. I really didn't like....Willie Stark from the beginning. He seemed kinda like a jackass, and guess what he was. He seemed to me more self-righteous and egotistical than anything. Even in the very beginning. So it didn't really surprise me to find out what an ass he became. He actually kinda reminded me of one of those evangelical preachers who rain fire and brimstone, and shout out the ""word of god."" I couldn't really understand the hold that he had over....Jack, the newspaper guy.&nbsp;I mean he was basically one of his ""bitches."" I wouldn't want to be the guy with the little black book. And what was with Jack's girlfriend Anne falling for willie stark?!&nbsp;I mean ewww. no thanks. sooo Not attractive. I suppose that she was just in love with him cause he reminded her of her father, i dunno. Either way, gross. I'd take jack over willie stark any day. I can't believe that she sold out her Uncle either...i mean wtf?! That is some messed up shit. Actually I couldn't understand what any of those women saw in willie stark. What a lush. Poor wife and paralyzed son. I couldn't believe that the brother would go so far as shooting him either. That seems a little crazy......and all because of his stupid sister. i blame her, what a manipulator/Ho. Anywho....i suppose i liked it. don't really want to watch it again tho' No thanks. <br /><br /><strong>All About Eve--1951&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/14/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>You know, you think that eve would have known better when she found that girl in her room. I mean really why else would she have been there. Silly eve.....and even though he was considered one of the bad guys i kinda liked Addison DeWitt. Such a crafty man, and so sarcastic. I think i actually laughed in the beginning when he was giving his monologue. No to mention that I also recognized him too.....i think he was in Search of the Castaways.....but not entirely sure. Anyway....I think if i was Margo Channing I would have kicked that girl out much sooner. Or actually not taken her in to live with me in the first place.....now that was just nuts. Crazy. That eve was a great liar. wow. what a manipulator. I did think it was kinda funny that she took addison DeWitt for granted....girl didn't have any idea who she was messing with. I was kinda surprised to see Margo with a younger man...i guess that i'm surprised that people found it acceptable back then....or maybe it was just okay for movie people? i dunno. Either way nice for her....but i gotta say she looke much older than just 40. But oooooooooh! i wasn't expecting the hottness that is Marilyn Monroe. Looking so fresh and young and oozing the sex. For a minute i almost didn't recognize her. anyway. I just hope that i don't meet some master manipulator like Eve....i'm too nice. I'd probably fall for it. As far as watching it again...well i don't know. it's kinda long and i don't think i would enjoy it as much...i think i would just get irritated at how stupid everyone is. Plus this movie is a little too long. But it is nice at the end to see everyone eve tried to ruin, happy and unscathed.<br /><br /><strong>An American In Paris--1952&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/22/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>For some reason or another i kept falling asleep while watching this one. I guess i got bored. Though Gene Kelly, what a cutie! so cute! i kinda thought of him sorta like a cross between frank sinatra and fred astaire, cause he can sing and dance. i dunno. so yeah i liked that. i don't really know why this one won best picture though. i thought that i was going to get a refreshing change from all those depressing war movies...instead i kinda just got bored....it took me 3 days to watch this all the way through. I liked the dancing and singing and the fact that everyone in the film was cast in roles they could actually perform themselves. That was nice. I really couldn't decide whether i thought the girl was cute or not though.....sometimes she was and sometimes she looked funny....i dunno. And i didn't really like the way it ended.....too many loose ends. It just seemed to be a mishmash of different musical numbers, or something. Though it does make me wanna watch other Gene Kelly movies. overall may watch again.<br /><br /><strong>The Greatest&nbsp;Show On Earth--1953&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/22/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>You know i can see why circuses aren't around anymore.....waaay to much work involved. it would cost too much to lug all that stuff around, not to mention all the animal rights activists and etc. I can't decide whether i like Charlton Heston or not....i do and yet there is something about him that i just can't get past...i dunno. Anyway....i liked this one i suppose, it was okay. i don't know it it's one of those i wanna watch again though........i liked seeing Gloria Grahame though...i loved her in oklahoma. She always seems to be playing some kinda tart though. either way.....i think that my favorite part was seeing bob hope and bing crosby in the audience. i laugh. i really didn't like that holly lady very much....don't know why. i liked seeing all the elephants and stuff. i love elephants. and all the people doing there circus acts and such.....it was a little weird seeing james stewart as a clown though. hmh. And i got the whole moral of the story or whatever you wanna call it. i think this one won because of all the exotic stuff in it though. i think that a lot of the movies that won are like that....full of things that are out of the ordinary&nbsp;for normal people. i did think that it was kinda funny when that sebastian guy said that brad was going to have better luck with the ladies now that he was getting his blood.<br /><br /><strong>From Here To Eternity--1954&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/23/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Uh. I didn't really like this one that much either....it was neat seeing all those places though. some of which took me a little while to place. For some reason i thought that scene on the beach was longer than it was.....hmh. that relationship confused me anyway.....i dont' see why she just couldn't divorce that guy anyway.....especially since he was leaving the island anyway. or is it that she just didn't want to be married to anyone other than an officer? Either way i was confused. so yeah. And did they all wear aloha shirts on their time off or was that just cause of the movie? i was a little perturbed by that.....but whatever. Any why did that lorene/alma lady lie to karen about what Prewitt did in the army? he wasn't a fighter pilot and he didnt' get any medal....so what's with the lying? Seems kinda ridiculous to me.....not to meniton that his death and maggios' death could have been avoided.&nbsp; i think it had more to do with them both being self-destructive and stupid. And i didn't really like maggio anyway....he was too....i dunno. either way,&nbsp;i did like montgomery clift though. cute.<br /><br /><strong>On The Waterfront--1955&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/26/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Ohhh! This one really made me miss taking black and white pictures! So contrasty! i heart constrasty pictures. anywho i liked the story it was good........i was a little perturbed by the music in the beginning...it was too jangly or something. not to mention that i kept expecting the sharks and jets to jump out and start dance fighting. I don't know if it's cause marlon brando is a great actor or what, but i really believed him as a dumb boxer type guy. i mean he even had those uber-hooded eyebrows. which i was a little weirded out by....dunno why. or maybe its just the way he speaks?......that sort of slow husky drawling way he has....i dunno. either way for some reason i liked that part in the end where he's struggling to walk to the warehouse to work and the point to view keeps switching from his to theirs.....i liked it...i didn't really like that girl to much tho'. something about her...and maybe i'm just cynical or maybe that is just how it was back then....but what is it with all these people falling in love so fast? that just doesn't seem ordinary to me. but whatever...it was weird to see that priest guy too. not to mention&nbsp;Terry's&nbsp;brother.....cause i recognized both of them from other movies....the priest guy plays a priest again in pollyanna and the brother is jed from oklahoma. which i heart. people can be so mean to each other sometimes....it makes me a little sad. what a bunch of bastards we are.<br /><br /><strong>Marty--1956&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/30/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Well i dont' know what to say really....i mean it was cute and nice and all, but i didn't really get why this one was best picture winner material. i dunno.....i can't figure out why everyone wasn't happy for him that he had finally met a girl...is it because they depended on him too much? and they didn't want him&nbsp;involved because that would take his attention away from them? and why didn't angie just go home rather than spend all that time looking for marty? isn't that kinda an unspoken agreement between people on the prowl? yeah..this movie kinda depressed me a little too what with my old age looming and being very much unattached. i am so glad that i don't live back then...i mean considering 29 as over the hill, or being an on the shelf spinster...that is just crazy talk, but still....i do wonder where my mr. good-for-me is. it also makes me wonder it i'm lumped into that fat ugly dog group that doesn't quite possess whatever it is that boys like. I don't think that i am...but i dunno. what can i say. either way....i liked it i suppose....mebbe i'll watch it again.....the cynic in me can't help but wonder tho' if they really weren't just settling.<br /><br /><strong>Around The World In 80 Days--1957&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4/30-5/1/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>How does one take the temperature of toast? i laugh....for some reason when he said that i started to laugh. actually i liked that whole stuffy british scene. anyway, I really liked this one and the only kinda liked this one...the parts when there is actual dialogue i liked but i got kinda bored watching all the scenery go by....maybe cause i kinda found it generic.....nothing that i haven't seen before. Plus i didn't really see the appeal of that guy who played passpartout. he was supposed to be some sorta acrobat and bullfighter....uh yeah. okay. i don't know why but i wasn't that impressed. i thought it was interesting to learn that this director named the whole cameo appearance thing. neat. i didn't recognize half of them though. even though i didn't like the passpartout guy he was in alot of interesting scenes. Like the one in the beginning where they follow him while he is riding the 2 wheel bike, going down the&nbsp;weight pulley&nbsp;shaft&nbsp;and when he's riding the horse. yeah.....and sooooooooo didn't recognize shirley Maclaine. so young. weird.oh and i liked the end where it was all animated. And i wasn't really to keen on the racism going on but&nbsp;i suppose it's understanding&nbsp;considering when the book was written, and the movie was made. I think one of my favorite parts is when he gets&nbsp;to Yokohama and resists the urge to steal that apple from the statue and then the girl gives him one......i think that is all about karma. oh&nbsp;and that spanish guy with the dancing....uh huh. nice&nbsp;chest hair...though i did kinda like the split filming they did there.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Bridge On The River Kwai--1958&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/3/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Uh.........yeah. This one....i dunno. i definitely didn't think that this one was as long as it was. for daaays. Geez. anyway the only one that i felt really sorry for was col. Saito. I kinda thought of Col. Nicholson as an arrogant ass. Even all the racism what with them saying that the japanese were idiots who couldn't build a bridge as well as the english. Please. What a bunch of crap. So yeah. idiots the lot of them. And how's col. nicholson not letting his own guys blow up his bridge? On the one hand i can understand sorta where he is coming from, but i think he just really lost sight of&nbsp;the ultimate objective. not to mention it was like miss saigon all over again with all those siamese ladies liking those soldiers. Uh-huh. lovely till something better comes along. boys. And i really just thought of Cmdr. Shears as a whiney crybaby. stupid american. overall i suppose that i liked it....not to watch again though. but it had some nice cinematography and some great acting by sir alec guiness, not to mention the whistling.<br /><br /><strong>Gigi--1959&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Uh,...mid 90's i think)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Didn't want to watch this one again....i saw it a long time ago and i can only recall that i didn't really like it that much. so having to watch it again? well yeah didn't really want to. not to mention that the funny looking girl from an american in paris is in it and i'm not really too excited to be&nbsp;confused about her looks again. Though i do really like&nbsp;Maurice Chevalier, he's so cute. Eitherway,&nbsp;i'll just try to catch it on cable.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Ben Hur--1960&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this one might have been in the late 80's?)(5/5/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>i think that I was made to watch this one because of my religious upbringing. The only thing that i really remember is the chariot race.....yeah well watched it again....it was good. charlton heston tho' ehh.this one was uber long too. what is it with all these uber long movies? everything keeps getting bigger and bigger and more elaborate. it's crazy. still i&nbsp; supposed that i liked this one....even if it had mr. heston in it.....there was good cinematography and the story was interesting. i like how it was interconnected from a historical standpoint. it would be interesting to be around at that time and be able to listen to Jesus speak, or at least be able to check him out. you know.<br /><br /><strong>The Apartment--1961&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/6/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>You know i kinda just found shirley Maclaine to be kinda irritating in this one.....i don't really know why. i guess cause her character is kinda stupid. but then again i feel that way about all people who cheat on others. i didn't really like how they made the whole adultery thing to be kinda okay or allowed in a way.....see the end of marriage started way before. we were all just to polite to talk about it. plus i didn't really like jack lemmons character either. what&nbsp;a pushover, he was way to subservient and i dunno just stupid......he did have his cute moments tho'. ohhhh, i did like all the hats though....not to mention the coat rack in the office....i laugh. or do they actually have things like that in office buildings on the mainland? either way.....oscar best picture winner? i don't get it.<br /><br /><strong>West Side Story--1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Forever ago--1988, i think)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I love you!!! I love you soooooo! I don't know what it is...hmh the awesome combo of singing and dancing maybe?! This movie made me want a white dress w/ a red sash. In later years after numerous viewings, It also made me want to watch the older version of romeo and juliet(1968). I think that my favorite parts are the america song and the very beginning when all the Jets and Sharks are terrorizing each other. I never really considered any of them as tough tho' I'd like to see any of them try and ""snap"" someone into submission. lol! I always felt sorry for that one girl who wanted to be a shark....she just wanted to be a part of the gang. boys.&nbsp; For the longest time i thought that Natalie Wood could really sing. What a sham! i dunno i just love this movie! Plus i think it was nice to be introduced to characters that weren't white. i can't really remember seeing that many when i was younger. Anyway i just like singing the songs....and was really happy when tnt was showing them as sing-a-longs on around new years a few years ago. fun! i heart movie musicals.<br /><br /><strong>Lawrence of Arabia--1963&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/10/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>ohmigod! longest movie ever! 3 hours and 45 flippin minutes! for daaays! i kept falling asleep in the beginning too.....tho i did like that opening shot with the overhead view of the motorcycle..... nicely composed shot there....i wonder if they waited for that exact time of day to get the shadows just right? i would assume so but maybe it was just a lucky accident.......i dunno....the movie was long and all but i think it was interesting enough were time didn't lag to bad...well at least in the beginning....toward the end i got a little antsy....not to mention by that time i was kinda tired of watching....lawrence....what an arrogant nut. Crazy! and what?! alec guiness as an Arab? uh no. but then again he'll always be Obi-Wan Kenobi to me anyway.....but yeah.....uh-huh. and was this based on true life events? i wasn't sure.....but supposed that they could be. now i really want to ride a camel though....so cute and they walk so funny. i love it. wouldn't want to have to drink that dirty muddy water though...too spoiled....though if i was dying of thirst i'm sure i wouldn't give a shit. eww do you think that water had shit in it? probably huh...gross....oh that reminds me....was lawrence raped in that one town with that Turkish general? or was he just beaten? i assumed he was raped but i wasn't sure......anywho....it was good to watch the first time....i don't know if i could a second time though......it's a little too long. 4 hours of vistas, panoramas crazy people and&nbsp;death? yeah not so much.<br /><br /><strong>Tom Jones--1964&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/12/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>America America, Cleopatra, How the West was Won, and Lilies of the Field. These are the other movies that were up for best picture as well......cause i really have&nbsp;NO flippin idea why tom jones won......ohmigod it&nbsp;reminded me of a really&nbsp;bad british comedy...i mean&nbsp;even the&nbsp;music...ugh! I just really have no idea.....i'm thinking that maybe it was for all the different camera angels and editing styles? maybe? either way.....ohmigod. never again. not to mention that the sophie girl is an idiot for wanting to be involved&nbsp;with that ladies man...well old ladies anyway. so yeah. whatever. and what in the world was with that scene where they are eating all that food? not to mention how do they even pay for any of that? <strong><br /></strong><strong><br />My Fair Lady--1965&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Probably around 8 too)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>My first introduction to Audrey Hepburn. She is just too cute. I was a little disappointed to find out that she didn't sing either....lies i tell you! so many lies! i still love this movie! i remember watching it&nbsp;weekly when i was younger. i think after awhile though i would only watch it up till her coming out ball. after that it gets all i dunno depressing and sad....plus i never really understood why she would pick Prof. Henry Higgins....he's such a crab and a pretentious bastard. don't really see the appeal, anyway i think this movie made me want to be a florist when i was younger...all the pretty flowers. Not to mention it made me wish i had a longer neck.....maybe not as long as audrey...but longer nevertheless. Still....love the singing! And i like Col. Pickering who was also in search of the castaways as well...i really like that movie too....anyway. yeah. i heart eliza doolittle.<br /><br /><strong>The Sound Of Music--1966&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ditto for this one)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Ahh! The Hills are alive!! With the sound of music! With songs they have sung, for a thousand years! That's my favorite part in Moulin Rouge.....anyway.....i love me some sound of music. i think it starts great and ends great. and i like the puppet show and the drape outfits and it makes me wanna go to the top of a hill, swing in a circle and sing to the sky, doesn't even matter what it is i sing.&nbsp;not to mention that&nbsp;afterward i've&nbsp;wanted a dress like liesl, the one she's wearing in the atrium/gazebo thing. so fluffy. not to mention that julie andrews is sooooo cute with her little haircut. plus i like that it's based in real life...i'm still a sucker for stuff like that.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Man For All Seasons--1967&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/13/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Boring! I mean really....i know it was all historical and all that but really....boring! costumes were nice i suppose.....and that girl that was in tom jones was in this one too, sophie. maybe i just don't like her as an actress? cause i really didn't like her in this one either....it was kinda weird to see that other lady though....uh..Wendy Hiller....who was also in Anne of Green Gables....i love that show. She's pretty much the same character....anywho. i go bored watching this one....and why are all the movies i've been watching uber long? so long.....i'm dying. maybe it's just a trend of the times....i think we must be heading back there again....cause movies made now are getting longer and longer. which i suppose can be a good and bad thing. I liked how clever thomas more was though.....so crafty. people are so corrupt....jerks. Anne boleyn wasn't the last woman he married right? wasn't she somewhere in the middle? either way....yeah...maybe i just don't get it. i suppose i need to go to some pretentious film school to be able to appreciate this movies supposed splendor. cause i am really just not understanding.<br /><br /><strong>In&nbsp;The Heat&nbsp;Of The Night--1968&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5/17/2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I liked the way the movie started.....interesting shots/editing effects.....not so much with all those flies in that hole in the wall diner tho' gross! not to mention that one just chillin with that lone piece of cake. plus that guy was some kinda creepy. i don't really think that this one is something i could watch all the time.....i think all the racism would irritate me after awhile....it was bad enough watching it the first time.....i did laugh though when that Endicott guy got hit back tho' that idiot....he even looked like he was going to cry. i laugh again. and oh poor Jed, you got so fat. you were husky in Oklahoma....i guess you just got old. hmh...well i hope that he got to keep his job as police chief, seeing as how his opinions changed. $168.35 by the way? was that alot back in the 60's? i suppose it was like having a minimum wage job now....maybe? well either way.....yeah. uh...i couldn't help but think that he was collecting all his evidence wrong though...i suppose that comes from watching too much CSI. and i mean really....things back then weren't even really very technical when it came to evidence...i mean wasn't even blood not identifiable until the 80's? at least on an affordable level? eh...oh well.....i think that if someone kept calling me girl like they called him boy all the time i would have to break someones skull.....those racist assholes. i am never ever ever going to live in the south. i don't care how much people has said it's changed. so not doing it. and what was with that weirdo diner guy and the pie thing? i really didn't get what was going on there....meh he was crazy anyway.<br /></font></p>"

Oh, on a utterly depressing side note, some jackass totally hit my car today.....i was pulling out of a stall and he hit me right on the ass.

Either way uber irritated today. He totally tired to blame it on me too....yeah i don't think so buddy. if anything it's 80-20. You really shouldn't have been driving so fast. I'm really okay though....even when it happened......it hardly registered. maybe i was just in shock...i dunno. Either way, i'll get over it.

"event","Today was a funfilled day. I went to famous footwear with krista jean and we went shoe shopping for work. We tried on a plethora off lovely black shoes including tempropedic shoes, reebok, and some wondeful comfy slip-ons that mrs.schug suggested! After a tedious morning krista finally picked some lovely black dressy shoes. She decided to keep the pantihoe samples that she used to try on her shoes. Krista then morphed into ""toad woman"" in the car. Then Mrs.Schug dropped us off at the King of Prussia Mall. We walked around for about 70 hours trying to find a shirt. We went to Hollister about 5 times and after a long time contemplating, we decided on 2 shirts from aber. We met a kind young woman at the pay phones who generously gave us 50 cents after her exciting episode with with the phone. Krista and i scavanged some money to but some icecream at coldstone and then we went home. i then went to the Upper Main Line YMCA and played some lacrosse for awhile and then now im home and trying to figure out what to do. umm yea ok bye!! <33 cmf"

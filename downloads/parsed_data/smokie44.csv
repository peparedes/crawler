"event","Heres's what has happened since the last time I posted....
  
   On Thursday my mom let me stay home, that night Billy had an operetta, which was Shadrach, Meshach, and Abendigo. It wasn't that great it was better when we performed it a long ass time ago.
    Then on Friday I got some money and went shopping I got a new belt and some new flip flops, I also bought rat food.
    Tomarrow Billy has a track meet and me and Arbuckle will be going its at Lutheran North and thats kinda far away, but I know how to get there. 

  Just because people have been asking me this is why I think Heather is a bitch....

     First off, Don't go crying to your mommy because of them stupid fucking naked pictures! Get the fuck over it! Your the one who took them, your the one who stole your parents alochol and got drunk before you took them, and your also the one who gave Lance permission to put them up. But I'm sure her parents don't know all of that.
      Another thing is that after all the things I have gotten her through she has the nerve to say I tried to run her life, and that is not the case at all she knows it too.
     I guess all I can say is that after everything it just goes to show you there is and end in friendship.
  And I guess she'd much rather go out with a smelly red headed little boy that likes to tell stories,punch trees, and torture animals in his spare time, his spare time being when he's not cheating on Heather.
     So anyway thats some of my side of the story for everyone to enjoy, I'm gettin' kinda tired so I'm gonna go talk to Lance and then Pass out.
                                 PEACE"

    Moy mom just got back from the hospital from having her surgery. She's doing o.k. just a little sick and everything she had a big ass tumor thing removed from her stomach. But shes doin pretty good.
     In other news....
   I heard from my brother the other day, he was only found guilty on one charge and that was drinking. He has to go to rehab and he's doin' that right now. Oh, and Pattys having a baby girl!
    I'm also going to be getting a snake pretty soon, by the summer anyway and its gonna be an albino something I forget its name, it was something crazy, anyway he'll get to be about 5 or maybe a little less.
     For now this is all I have I gotta go do something for my mom.

"event","Today I didn't go to school because I had some kinda cold. I gotta go to school tomarrow though. On Friday I'm gonna go to the Detroit Zoo! Thats gonna be so much fun. 
  For this weekend....
      On Sunday after I got my money me and Arbuckle went to a carnival that was so fucking awesome! We also went to Girbralter and got some cool things from there. On Saturday is when we did my room. I did some other things but, I can't remember everything right now.
    We don't have school on friday so thats really cool especially since I get to go to the zoo. 
     Yesterday there was such an awesome thunderstorm! I love thunderstorms! This Saturday me and Arbuckle are going to go to my little brothers track meet. He had one last week and did really good first place in shot put! and he got I think second in the 200, so hes doin really good this year.
     My mom is goin to get surgery on Wednesday, I hope she'll be ok, I'm sure she will though, I'm happy she's finally gettin' that damn surgery she need it and she'll finally be out of pain everytime she moves.
     Thats about it for now Peace"

"event","So today I completely rearranged my room me and Arbuckle did it actually, it looks like I have so much space now, Ilove it!
  After we finished my room we went to the mall and I bought a new purse and some other things, after that we went back to his house and talked to Lance for a lil bit, then we got really stoned.
    Tomarrow I have to go work but after that Im gonna go to Gerbralter. I'm so happy we got this Friday off! Thats so fuckin' awesome! It's almost summer time! 
     I wish I didn't have to get up so early tomarrow, oh well at least I'm gettin paid. My older brother went to court on the 7th, but I don't know what happened yet, I won't know for a couple of weeks.
       I have more to say but I'm to tired to remember right now so

                      PEACE"

"event","I have decided to completely start this journal over, no more of that old drama thats use to be in here this is all new.
   So where to start......while.... 
I read Lance's journal and it says that he will be coming home on june 24th!!! Thats so fucking awesome! I can't wait for Lance to get back, If you even read this Lance we can't wait for you to get home!
  Nothing to amazing really happened today, my brother goes to court on May 7th, yes thats right back to court, this time he didn't get in trouble for resisting arrest, DUI, assaulting and officier, and manufacturing E. It was just driving around with a loaded gun. I swear that boy will never learn.
   My little brother just turned 13, which is the scariest thing to ever happen, he went to a dance a few days ago, thats was not cool at all. It was a lock-in with girls, girls to him should still have cooties. lol.
    As of right now to much stuff is going on for me to post it all, so there you have the tip of the iceberg. I'll try an up date all the time and keep whoever (if anyone) informed.
           All my love
               Melissa"

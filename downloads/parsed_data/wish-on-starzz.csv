<P ALIGN=CENTER> VENTING <P ALIGN=left>

like alright.. i just want to tell everyone how pissed off i am about the stupid jernal codes!! okay.. these codes took 4 hours to do!! and then kristina stole my password and copied my codes and gave them to other people that STILL continue to pass them on to more people!! guys.. i kno they are just jernal codes.. but i wanted mine to look pretty.. and i wanted to be original.. so thats why i took the time to do this.. and then when someone copies and pastes <b>my</b> work.. i cant help but to be upset.. i know that theres nothin i can do now, except grin and shit becuz nobody would even consider doing there jernal by themselves-- so yeah. i would just like you to know-- that if anyone would have ASKED me to do their jernal for them, i would have kindly said ""yes"" and done it when i had time. doesnt it bother you that you ALL have the same looking journal?? its special when only a few people have it.. and i would be more then happy to do codes for you to make yers suit YOU. isnt that what a journal is-- something that represents <u>you</u> and your thoughts?.. oh well tho.. i tried to make mine look a LITTLE bit different by making hearts and stuff.. but i dont think that i should have to change MY jernal becuz someone took MY codes. thats cheap.

also.. my mom is being sooo lame.. like today i had to go to the doctor.. and that wasnt good.. all she wants to do is prove that shes right, that i am a failure. and like ive said before, when you hear the same thing over and over again, you start to believe it. and when your told that YOUR the reason the family is falling apart, that YOUR the reason your parents fight, and YOUR the reason your mom wants to leave-- it hurts.. i cant say that it doesnt, because it does.. and if your reading this, im assuming your my friend-- which means you <b>know</b> how i take everything people say to heart. and i have to admit that it hurts when people say things like that to me, even if they are the truth.

well.. i love everyone.. im just confused.. so incredibly confused that i dont know what i want or what to expect anymore.. im actually gonna try to not expect anything from anyone, becuz the less you expect-- the less chance of bein let down or disappointed.. i sugguest you all do the same about me. dont expect too much, i have a habit of letting people down."

""The 21 Day Challenge was created to help people break a bad habit or start a good one. Experts agree that it takes 21 days to either break or make a habit. Some of the habits range from cutting back on eating, to watching less television. Whatever you want to do to better yourself."""

Troy and I are going up to Bar Harbor on Sunday for 4 days. Back to the Harbor. Why are we such gluttons for punishment? Because it's not punishment anymore. We're not working lunch shifts on the veranda, and we don't have Dog Alley on a rainy day. We're going up there for 4 days of summer in Bar Harbor without having to be at work at 10am. Does that mean we are going to drink excessively and be completely irresponsible? Of course it does. Because if there's one thing that Bar Harbor summers have taught us, it's that responsibility is like herpes: once you have it, you can never REALLY get rid of it. But until then, go ahead and fuck whoever you want to.



I'll try to keep some semblance of a running journal. No promises."

"event","So I was reading my journal tonight, and I realized something: I'm a good fucking writer! So without further ado, here is what I have been up to lately:

- I work at a new restaurant in downtown Boston called Ivy;
- When I'm not working, I get high and play Madden quite often;
- I've been dating a girl named Lauren (that's right, Katherine, there's a female who has sex with me on a regular basis. Eat it!);
- I just got back from a mini-vacation in South Florida where I got sun-poisoning and had a great time getting it;
- I don't drink nearly as much as I used to (saving it up for summer);
- I haven't spoken to my father since I left Alaska last May, and I am ok with that;
- I'm not nearly as angry as I used to be (regular sex does that to me);
- Fuck it, I've been pretty happy lately!


And now I am going to start writing again. If you're reading this and you notice I haven't updated for a few days, send me a vengeful IM. I'll thank you for it eventually, I swear..."

I have a gigantic pile of clean clothes at the foot of my bed, not just because I am a messy person, but because I have no dresser or bureau to put my clothes in. I have a closet, but that doesn't do much for my socks and underwear. Right now the most important thing in my life is getting to sleep before 5am, so I can ostensibly wake up before 3pm and go to the gym before work. Then I'll go to work and serve food to people who won't look me in the eye when they're speaking to me. Exciting, no? 


This has to be the worst show on television.


I feel good tonight because I got a vote of confidence from an old friend who read this journal. She read it with her brother and said that they both laughed out loud at certain parts. That's the kind of shit that makes me want to keep writing, even when I think I'll probably be a waiter until my premature death at the hands of some asshole with a gun who wants my wallet. Shit, nevermind. I'm rambling now.

"event","On Wednesday, Troy and I got high and went to see ""Batman Begins"". It was about 5:45pm when we got on the T at Northeastern, the middle of rush hour. I don't think I have ever been in such an amazing crush of humanity before. It was so crowded that we were standing in the doorwell of the train and I was still being touched on all sides by people. The person right in front of me was a girl whose face I never even saw, but for about 10 minutes we were as close as lovers. I can still see the freckles on her neck, and I can smell the perfume she was wearing, minlged with the faintest trace of sweat. I could have leaned slightly forward and kissed her ear, and so of course I had to fight the urge to do exactly that. When the train would lurch forward after each stop, she would be caught slightly off balance, and would fall into me so that our arms or legs touched. When she finally got off at the Copley T stop, I had to take a deep breath and let it out slowly to clear the cobwebs she had left in my mind. I looked at Troy, and he had that funny little half-smile that people get when they're stoned in public and have to make a conscious effort not to start giggling out loud. 

Finally we got to the theater, but the movie wasn't nearly as good as the train ride there."

"event","I guess I haven't written since Tuesday. The anger is mostly gone, but I still feel like everytime I get rejected a little piece of my soul dies. Is that likely? Or even possible? I was pretty angry right up until Wednesday morning, when Troy put it in perspective for me. Since then, everything has more or less gone back to normal. More or less. Troy and I took Tuesday and Wednesday off from drinking; instead, we got high and went to the movies back to back nights. First we saw Bewitched, which isn't worth the price of admission, then we saw War of the Worlds, which defintely is. I'm not usually one to get a boner for summer blockbusters, but this movie was pretty well done. Go see it. Thursday night, I got out of work late and pounded some Jack and Coke's at Solas before they closed. Friday was a mess. Troy, Kim and I got off work at 10pm and I was blacked out by 1am. Today was ridiculous, because doubles are ridiculous. Troy called Jess' friend ugly and Kevin Millar and Mark Bellhorn ate lunch at Vox. Meghan was star-struck, even though she admittedly does not like either of them. I still have half a bottle of Sauza sitting on my night stand. I'm not going to drink it tonight. The Russian vodka has not been touched, I think I will save it for my birthday. Russian vodka and Sox-Yankees tickets. This could turn out to be my best birthday in 11 years. Hooray me!

"event","I don't think I am emotionally healthy. 


In the past, rejection by a girl was followed by intense self-loathing, depression, despair, and any number of other passively destructive emotions. 

Now, all I feel is anger.


Why not me? Why another tool douchebag with gel-waived hair and 'roided-out biceps?  Why some self-absorbed asshole with just enough personality to convince a drunk girl to go home with him? What the fuck, Joel? I'd like to choke the fucking life out of every single striped-shirt yuppie dickhead I see out every night, just on general principle. I know they're not all assholes. But I don't care. 

This is evolution.


The fratboys I hated in college have become the yuppies I hate now. I hate them for the same reasons I hated them before. They represent everything I am not: rich, good-looking, self-sonfident and socially-adored. Christ, how can anybody take these people seriously? They are a living, breathing joke, and I thought for sure I had left them behind when I left USM. How naive I was! Will I always be plagued by this incessant reminder of my own imperfection? 

Will I always be this melodramatic?


Why anger? My rejection music used to be The Verve and Counting Crows. Now it's Eminem and DMX. It's not even focused anger: I hate everything about the situation. The rants about fratboys/yuppies are just that: rants. They help me avoid the reality of the situation, which is that I am just as angry at the rejector as I am about the cause of my rejection.

"event","Just to catch you up on the last couple days:

Tuesday: Stayed in.

Wednesday: Got cut early from my lunch shift. Did laundry. Stayed in.

Thursday: Got out of work at 1:45am. Went to Solas. Ordered 3 LI Ice Teas. Drank them all. Watched Family Guy with Troy and James at my apartment. Smoked 'dro.

Friday: Worked a double. Played the word game with Troy and Cara on the dinner shift. 
Succesfully worked the words ""unicorn"", ""porcupine"" and ""flaming"" into tableside conversation. Decided it was foo-foo drink Friday. Drank cosmo at Fish. Drank 4 cosmos and a shot in 20 minutes at Solas. Walked home. Watched Cara and Rames go swimming in the Infinity Pool at the CSC. Peed in a doorway on the way home. Watched Family Guy while drunk.

Saturday: Slept til 1:30pm. Worked with K until 1:15am. Accidentally exposed Kelly's right breast at the host stand. Felt bad. Talked to a couple at one of my tables. Was told by the girl that I was more interesting than her date. Ego boosted. Felt bad for the girl who was obviously not into her date. Could not think of a way to politely tell date to leave.  Went to Fish after work with Troy, Kristen, Hank the Tank, James, Eva and Cara. Drank scotch. Went to China Town with same crew, minus James. Drank cold tea mixed with sake. Broke Eva into the crew. She can hang. Made Cara believe that I hate Troy. Came home. Listened to music. Wrote in journal. Realized it was getting light out. Punched myself in the balls for staying up so late. Went to bed. 



Is it just me, or is this journal getting a little repetitive?

Here is a timeline for the events of Monday, June 20th, 2005:


10:30am: Wake up.

11:30am: Smoke with Troy and Alejandro.

12:00pm: Watch Revenge of the Sith. Again.

3:00pm: Walk around Newbury St. with Troy and Alejandro.

3:30pm: Drive around Boston in a drop-top Mercedes with Alejandro's Saudi Arabian friend Karim.

6:00pm: Play first game of the Corporate Basketball League season against Liberty Mutual; get asses kicked by a bunch of accountants.

8:00pm: Get cleaned up at Troy's house for a night on the town.

9:00pm: Get to Bricco's, get denied entrance due to casual/slovenly appearance.

9:30pm: Take cab back to apartment, change into yuppie uniform, take cab back to Bricco's.

9:45pm: Drink first glass of free champagne.

9:49pm: Drink second glass of free champagne.

10:00pm: No longer keeping track of how many glasses of free champagne have been drank.

10:15pm: Make fun of Kristen for kissing James.

10:30pm: Troy and Cara are fighting.

10:45pm: Troy and Cara are making out at the bar.

11:00pm: Reassure Jen that dating older guys is ok, fail to mention that dating younger girls is not.

11:15pm: Get K's phone number. Forget that dating younger girls is not ok.

11:20pm: Am told by K that she is not into ""the dating thing"". Remember my own advice on younger girls just in time to see it rendered moot by K's hedonistic attitude.

11:45pm: Follow K to Sissie K's.

12:00am: K tells me she can ""drink me under the table any day"", as long as I take 4 shots for every 3 she takes, to make up for our difference in body mass.

12:05: K tells me she likes 4 things: drinking, eating, sleeping and having sex. Not necessarily in that order.

12:10: K tells me her best feature is probably her DSL's.

12:15pm: Decide that I am in love with K.

12:17pm: Tell K she is fat. Sarcasm takes a few seconds to penetrate the alcohol.

1:00am: Leave Sissie K's and take a cab to Solas.

1:30am: Leave Solas and go to Saint.

2:00am: Leave Saint and go back to apartment.

2:30am: Try to smoke out of a rolled-up dollar bill. Fail.

3:00am: Trade text messages with Kristen, who is on the futon next to my bed.

3:30am: Send text-message to Kristen asking if she believes in guilt-free sex.

3:32am: Kristen doesn't believe in guilt-free sex.

3:35am: Kristen falls off the futon for the first time.

4:00am: Turn off cell phone. Pass out.




Needless to say, celebrating your 3rd anniversary by having an open bar and letting well-dressed people in off the streets is ok in my book. Bowling tonight, updates to follow.

Happy Birthday, K!"

"event","Sorry about that, friends and neighbors, but I actually couldn't get online for the last week or so. To quickly recap, Troy and I went to Bar Harbor on Monday and stayed until Wednesday morning. What happens in Bar Harbor stays in Bar Harbor, but I will leave you with these teasers:

""My face smells like shaved pussy.""
                  - A drunken friend


""I'm the reason she cries when she has sex.""
                  - Another drunken friend


Happy 21st Birthday, Pete. Hope you had a good time.


In other news, the Official Boylston-Newbury Summer-long Bender has continued full-swing, with recent highlights including the initiation of ""Scotch Saturday"", on which we celebrate the anniversary of Lauren threatening to lick my taint and Kristen making up and making out with a certain hated enemy.

Tomorrow is the first game of the season for the Vox Bukkake Warriors in the Professianal City-League Basketball Tournament. We have no idea who our opponents will be, we just know that we will kick the ever-living shit out of whoever is unfortunate to play the Quatrucci Juggernaut.



That's all for now, folks. Enjoy this posting while it lasts, because I have a sneaking suspicion that I will be legally obligated to remove it within 24 hours.

tinyforest: you seem sort of obsessed
twoguardsupreme: agreed
twoguardsupreme: i actually just like to make gay people uncomfortable
twoguardsupreme: that's my thing
tinyforest: thats often a sign of latent homosexuality
twoguardsupreme: is it?
tinyforest: yes
twoguardsupreme: interesting
twoguardsupreme: thing is, i might be gay, except i love boobies too much
twoguardsupreme: i heart tatas
tinyforest: then i bet youre bi
twoguardsupreme: it is possible
twoguardsupreme: cept
tinyforest: probable in fact
twoguardsupreme: i have no affinity for any cock other than my own
twoguardsupreme: i am a chronic maturbator
tinyforest: hm doubtful
twoguardsupreme: i will admit at
tinyforest: you are so lame
tinyforest: i dont know if ive talked to anyone as lame as you
twoguardsupreme: i am flattered
twoguardsupreme: no really
tinyforest: you should be
twoguardsupreme: the funny thing is
twoguardsupreme: i hate anti-gay people more than anybody
twoguardsupreme: but i find that baiting gay people is more FUN than anything
twoguardsupreme: ironic, no?
tinyforest: the ironic thing is that youre the faggot 
twoguardsupreme: faggot is a fun word
twoguardsupreme: it drives ""straight"" people crazy
tinyforest: youd probably irk me more if you talked about politics
tinyforest: the gay thing is a non-issue
tinyforest: im ok if youre gay
tinyforest: i have no problem with it
twoguardsupreme: politics is a non-issue with me
twoguardsupreme: all politicians are wrong
tinyforest: that bespeaks your maturity
twoguardsupreme: that is my bottom line'
tinyforest: youre smart
tinyforest: bye
twoguardsupreme: also, people who think that politics are an issue
twoguardsupreme: they make me laugh
twoguardsupreme: people who get so fired up over what is essentially a difference in semantics
twoguardsupreme: hilarious
tinyforest: that bespeaks an incredible ignorance on your part
twoguardsupreme: the word ""bespeaks"" bespeaks an incredible lack of vocabulary on your part
twoguardsupreme: but anyways
twoguardsupreme: i digress
twoguardsupreme: if you think for one golden second that anything you shout at a gay pride rally matters in this country, then you are more ignorant than 1000 G.W. Bush's
twoguardsupreme: what is politics?
twoguardsupreme: the art of the compromise
twoguardsupreme: woohoo!
twoguardsupreme: compromise!
twoguardsupreme: let's all celebrate that!

"event","Finished my 3rd training shift at Vox tonight. Took about 4 or 5 tables, averaged about 20% per table. Still have to get used to the fact that people run your food and bus your tables for you. I've been in Boston for about 5 days now, and every day I seem to be seeing more and more amazingly beautiful women. It really boggles the mind, and leaves me feeling more than a little inadequate. As usual, I think that there is no way any of these girls would be interested in a guy like me, but at the same time I feel that to settle for anything less would be cheating myself. It's a vicious circle, and I hate the fact that I can so easily see myself doing what I always do, which is hook up with the first girl who shows a little interest, then hate myself for it afterwards. God I hate myself sometimes. How can somebody be so narcissistic and still hate themself at the same time? Wow, I am fairly sure that last sentence was a grammatical trainwreck. Who even reads this fucking journal? I'm so happy to be in Boston right now, yet I'm so frustrated because I feel like I am in the exact same place I was in a year ago. My life lacks forward momentum, to steal a phrase from Bret Easton Ellis. Better yet, Orson Welles summer up the duality of my nature perfectly, how many fucking years ago:

""Everything about me is a contradiction, and so is everything about everyone else. We are made out of oppositions; we live between two poles. There is a Philistine and an aesthete in each of us, and a murderer and a saint. You don't reconcile the poles; you just recognize them.""


How perfect is that? Is it baseless pride to believe that I am that complex? Honestly, how complex is it to claim to have a good side and an evil side? Black and white is what it is, black and white.



Christ, my brain hurts.



I'm going to read a Playboy and go to sleep.



Au revoir..."

"event","I finally made it to Boston. One week ago today, I was still in Alaska, land of the Midnight Sun and permafrost. Now I'm right in the middle of the oldest city in America, and the mercury hasn't dipped below 65 since I've been here. My apartment is on the 5th floor of a ratty old tenement, but my room is spacious and the location is ridiculous. There are two pizza places, a liquor store, a grocery store, a Burger King, a Store 24 and a bar right on my block. The YMCA is directly across the street. I can walk to the Prudential Building, Newbury St., Fenway Park, pretty much anywhere. My workplace, too, is within easy walking distance. Vox Populi, the restaurant I work at is a lot like Rupununi's in Bar Harbor. Except the food is better. And I'll make more money. And the employees all get along. And it is twice as easy. And it's in friggin' Boston. Get the picture? I trained with Troy on Saturday night, and he didn't run his own food or bus a table all night. He took cigarette breaks with the managers in the middle of what would be equal to a 4th-of-July rush in Bar Harbor. That being said, I do miss my friends back in the Harbor. You fuckers need to come visit. You know I'll be up there at some point.

I'm going to go lay on the roof for a little while and try to catch a tan.

Workplace: Vox Populi, 755 Boylston St.

Livingplace: 309 Huntington Ave.



Needless to say, I am fairly excited.


One quick travel note: I bought 3 magazines in the Detroit airport; ESPN the Mag with Manu Ginobili on the cover, Rolling Stone with Darth Vader on the cover, and Playboy with Bai Ling (who apparently plays a Senator in Episode III) on the cover. 

Basketball, Star Wars and beautiful naked Asian chicks who appear in Star Wars. Does it get any better than that? Yes it does, because I glanced through all 3 mags while drinking a Guinness at 7:45am in an airport bar. Mmmm Guinness.




Never thought I'd say this, but it is good to be back in Portland."

that?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: you are fucking ridiculous<BR>twoguardsupreme: who lit the fuse on your tampon?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: you did<BR>twoguardsupreme: because I quoted a movie for my away

man<BR>twoguardsupreme: i want to respond to something you said, but i can't figure out which statement is most absurd<BR>JesusHChrriiist: thats because none of them are<BR>twoguardsupreme: oh

yes<BR>JesusHChrriiist: and that suck,s<BR>twoguardsupreme: aha<BR>JesusHChrriiist: but the enlightened views are only from old ancient dead people that lived in nature and not this shit hole<BR>twoguardsupreme: So tell me<BR>twoguardsupreme: what would you change?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: and they are only in liberating from western closed minded thought<BR>twoguardsupreme: what?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: i would remove you from the gene pool<BR>twoguardsupreme: hahahaha<BR>twoguardsupreme: well, i wasn't planning on having kids, but now I might just have a baker's dozen, just to piss you off<BR>twoguardsupreme: <BR>twoguardsupreme: for real though, your current misguided PMS anger aside for a minute, what would you do to change our society for the better?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: well i guess after you've mated with chelsea clinton, the only woman who will fuck you, i'd have to abduct your little haddadites and either drown them or send them to monastaries or something<BR>twoguardsupreme: mmm chelsea clinton<BR>JesusHChrriiist: for the record i just finsihed my period, so it is impossible for me to currently be under the influences of

cannot let it dominate our lives<BR>JesusHChrriiist: it does dominate our lives<BR>twoguardsupreme: does it?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: yes<BR>twoguardsupreme: example?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: we live in north america because white people decided to invade <BR>JesusHChrriiist: and our entire environment is shaped by that change<BR>twoguardsupreme: so what do you think the world would be like if Europe had left North America alone?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: there is no way of telling<BR>twoguardsupreme: bearing in mind that such a thing would be absolutely impossible<BR>twoguardsupreme: exactly<BR>twoguardsupreme: so why dwell on it?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: obviously the past is history<BR>JesusHChrriiist: but you must learn from the past<BR>twoguardsupreme: nothing you say or do is going to change that<BR>JesusHChrriiist: and the majority of the population has not<BR>twoguardsupreme: so how would you apply the lesson we learned from colonizing america to today's world?<BR>twoguardsupreme: bear in mind, if this turns into an anti-war discussion, you instantly lose whatever sliver of credibility you still retain<BR>JesusHChrriiist: well that's a huge issue, that would take more than just me to solve, but the point is that if everyone doesn't first recognize the major problems that are created by this society than change is not possible<BR>JesusHChrriiist: there needs to be a revolution<BR>twoguardsupreme: this is why you are ridiculous<BR>twoguardsupreme: all you do is repeat whatever the last sentence you read in your

of ideas<BR>twoguardsupreme: if you're so keen on changing the world, if you want a revolution, then maybe you should take an afternoon off from taking glamour shots of yourself and your friends and actually DO something<BR>JesusHChrriiist: i am doing things<BR>JesusHChrriiist: and i AM going to DO something<BR>twoguardsupreme: yea, way to go, you got irrationaly pissed at somebody's away message<BR>twoguardsupreme: buckle up!<BR>JesusHChrriiist: why was that irrational?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: don't give me that emotions getting in the way of reason crap<BR>twoguardsupreme: story of your

wrong<BR>twoguardsupreme: it's funny because people like you make it funny<BR>twoguardsupreme: if i didn't get a reaction like this from people like you, there would be no reason at all for me to put it there<BR>twoguardsupreme: you validate it<BR>JesusHChrriiist: no shit<BR>twoguardsupreme: you make it funny<BR>JesusHChrriiist: i validate your meaningless existence?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: i realize that you put those up there specifically for people such as i<BR>twoguardsupreme: no, my meaningless existence validates itself<BR>twoguardsupreme: you validate sexist humor<BR>JesusHChrriiist: but as long as they are up there i will be continuing to state my opinion <BR>twoguardsupreme: and i will continue to put them up there<BR>twoguardsupreme: so i can have journal-fodder conversations like this one<BR>JesusHChrriiist: and i will continue to think you are an idiot<BR>JesusHChrriiist: and one day you will see that you are an idiot<BR>twoguardsupreme: and i will continue to cry myself at sleep at nights, thinking that one of the dumbest girls i have ever met thinks i'm the dumb one<BR>twoguardsupreme: oh wait, no i won't<BR>JesusHChrriiist: well i'm not dumb<BR>twoguardsupreme: i know

you are but what am i?<BR>twoguardsupreme: hahahahahahahaha<BR>JesusHChrriiist: well i have plenty of self-awareness<BR>twoguardsupreme: if you say so<BR>twoguardsupreme: quick question:<BR>JesusHChrriiist: so you really think that men have created some great things huh?<BR>twoguardsupreme: who listens to these rants and nods their head?<BR>twoguardsupreme: who agrees with you?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: people who i have had the time and energy to explain things to<BR>twoguardsupreme: somebody must be giving you some form of encouragement, or you would have moved onto the next meaningless fad by now<BR>JesusHChrriiist: i don't live by fads<BR>twoguardsupreme: and THAT might be the funniest thing you have EVER said<BR>JesusHChrriiist: the only way to get people in this narrow minded western culture to understand anything is to explain it in their own reason oriented terms<BR>twoguardsupreme: is it?<BR>twoguardsupreme: so what do you call what you are doing now?<BR>twoguardsupreme: failing miserably?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: well, to get tehm to adhere to anything<BR>JesusHChrriiist: not bothering to do it<BR>twoguardsupreme: liar<BR>JesusHChrriiist: because it would take a load of effort that i'm not willing to expend<BR>twoguardsupreme: why are you still talking to me?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: because you are still talking<BR>twoguardsupreme:

and your asenine reasoning system<BR>twoguardsupreme: what do you know of my reason?<BR>twoguardsupreme: another question:<BR>JesusHChrriiist: that it is insufficient<BR>twoguardsupreme: do you think

continue<BR>twoguardsupreme: anyways, like i was saying, dumb people like YOU are ruining society for people like me, who just want to enjoy their short lives while they have them<BR>JesusHChrriiist: the only thing that keeps your lives enjoyable is your fucking ignorance<BR>twoguardsupreme: no, it's people like you who are so scared of ignorance that it consumes you<BR>twoguardsupreme: if i am ignorant, so be it<BR>twoguardsupreme: i can live with it<BR>twoguardsupreme: dumb people like you can't<BR>JesusHChrriiist: joking about women being stupid is not funny<BR>JesusHChrriiist: it hurts

is saying that shit in a place where is should be said<BR>twoguardsupreme: ohhh, so now you are the AIM FCC, trying to control what i put in my away message?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: no you can say whatever the fuck you want but you still have to reap the consequences<BR>twoguardsupreme: so we agree that i can say whatever the fuck i want?<BR>twoguardsupreme: and that people should not get upset about it?<BR>JesusHChrriiist: no people should definitely get upset about it<BR>twoguardsupreme: why?<BR>twoguardsupreme: i don't have any 6 year old children on my buddy list<BR>twoguardsupreme: i

"event","Moving to Alaska may be the worst decision I have ever made in my entire life, but once in a while a moment of sheer idiotic hilarity appears on the horizon of what has otherwise been an ocean of abject misery and loneliness. Some examples of the ridiculous things I have seen or heard here at the edge of the world:

- Much like a college dorm, many of the villages in Northwest Alaska are either ""dry"" or ""damp"". Dry, of course, means that alcohol is strictly forbidden within the town limits, while in a damp village you can possess alcohol, but you cannot sell or buy it. Whole towns still living under Prohibition! Of course, in the dry villages, alcohol is harder to get than most drugs, thus driving the prices for bootlegged booze through the roof. I've heard that a fifth of just about anything can go for as high as $500 under the right conditions. That's quite a mark-up on a $20 bottle. If anybody ever figures out a way to consistently smuggle booze to these villages, they could become fairly rich fairly quickly. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...


- I don't mean to sound like an elitist, intellectual snob, but everyone in this town (and I hear it is worse in the villages) talks like a cross between someone from Fargo, North Dakota and a retard. Seriously. Think about how you think that combination might sound. Yea, that is EXACTLY how they sound. I have to consciously stop myself from baby-talking to them. Am I evil? Maybe. I like to justify it by telling myself that I hate everyone equally. Which is mostly true.


- Continuing with the theme of hating everyone in this town, besides their ridiculous speech patterns, the entire population of Nome consists of three types of people: Eskimoes who drink alot, 4th-generation Scandinavian rednecks who drink a lot, and the thousands and thousands of children who are the result of both of the aforementioned groups drinking a lot. Seriously, there are a lot of fucking kids running around this town. And I'm going to stop now before this turns into a rant.


- Back to the funny stuff. Perhaps one of the funniest things I have ever seen, in fact. Dogs in gunny sacks. Read it again. Yea. Dogs in gunny sacks. That's what I loaded onto a cargo airplane yesterday afternoon. In order to transport their sled dogs from one race to another, the mushers who can't afford kennels tie their dogs up in old flour sacks with just their heads sticking out, then throw them on a truck or a plane or whatever they need to get from one place to another, thus preventing the dogs from fighing/shitting/buggering each other all over the place. You really have to see it to fully appreciate just how funny it is. I know it sounds cruel. It is cruel. I'm not here to debate that. I'm just saying it's fucking hilarious.





There are a lot more things, but I can't remember them all now. And I'm lazy."

"event","<P>Sometime last week I had the most intense dream of my life. I dreamt that I died. Like in most remembered dreams, the events leading up to the climax are a blur, like trying to watch a movie through the bottom of a pint glass. I remember that I was with a group of people, and we were being robbed. There were at least two men, one with a gun, and they were going to each person in our group individually and telling them to hand over $100. I guess we must have been in a restaurant, because after each person agreed to pay the $100, the robber with the gun would place the gun on the table, as some sort of bizzare gesture of good faith. It was very reminiscent of the end scene from 'Pulp Fiction', which actually makes sense because that movie has been playing a lot on TV lately. I remember being relieved that they were only asking for $100 from each person, because I had at least $400 in my wallet. For some reason, it never entered my mind to question the bizarre symbology involved in asking for a fixed sum from people you were stealing from. The man with the gun came to me, and asked me to give him $100. As I reached into my pocket, everything seemed to slow down, I could feel my mind shifting into a purely analytical state. Thoughts I could not explain started scrolling across my peripheral vision like an HUD in a fighter jet: ""The gun is laying right there on the table don't let him see all the money in your wallet how far away is the gun what kind of bills do you have in your wallet this guy is smaller than you you are quick you play basketball and work out sometimes you have twenties from the ATM where's the other guy the gun is right there the other guy is watching you it doesn't matter he doesn't have a gun the gun is right there go for it no don't he is closer to the gun it doesn't matter you are quicker and he will be surprised and you are stronger than him and the gun is right there the gun is right there THE GUN IS RIGHT TH-"" and I lunge at the gun sitting on the table, and he must have seen it in my eyes because he lunges for it too, only a fraction of a second after I do. I grab the gun by the chamber (it is a revolver) and he grabs it by the stock and now we are locked into the deadliest arm-wrestling match ever, because we are both trying to twist the gun away from the other person. I remember being aware of all the sets of eyes staring at us, but the only thing I could think about was that I was losing, my arms were being forced down and my wrists were starting to bend at that awkward angle that for arm wrestlers is the point of congratulations-you-just-lost. I was never a good arm wrestler, but I was still surprised because this guy was so much <EM>smaller</EM> than me, and if I lose I am going to <EM>die</EM>. Then a scene from 'Dragonball' flashed across my HUD and I knew that I could beat this guy if I just tried that much harder. So my stomach tightened and I slowly began forcing his arms back up and around, and now his wrists were rotating back and I realized that I had not looked at the robber since I had grabbed the gun and now I looked up and I could see fear stamped on his face, it was in the way he bit his lips and his forehead was wrinkled and he was sweating. And just then his arms and wrists crossed the point of no return and he gasped as he let go of the gun. I laughed. Then as I was thinking of something very witty or very badass to say to the robber, I noticed that the other man was reaching into his coat pocket and I have see enough movies to know what <EM>that</EM> means. He had the gun out by the time I could point my gun at him, and now we were in a standoff, but I knew that it was going to be a very short standoff because I could tell just by looking at him that he was going to shoot, it was in his eyes. His eyes were unfocused, like he was looking through me, and his lips were slightly parted and there was no way he was <EM>not</EM> going to shoot. I tried to shout something, probably nothing more profound than ""Don't!"", but then I pulled the trigger just as he pulled the trigger and I heard both guns go off distinctly, although I could not tell whose gun actually went off first. And at the same instant that I heard the guns, I felt the bullet catch me just above my heart, I felt it burrow into my chest, and I remember thinking that it felt like getting hit with a wet beanbag, only the sensation of the beanbag was replaced immediately by a sensation of falling and trying to catch my breath at the same time. I fell backwards, but I caught myself with my hands, not like in the movies when they just keel over. It was more like I had just slipped on a patch of ice. My gun was gone but I didn't care because holy jesus I'm SHOT. I actually got shot! I remember thinking that if this were a dream, I should be waking up right... about... NOW but I didn't wake up, I just looked down but I couldn't see any blood because I was wearing a dark jacket. I didn't feel any acute pain, only the kind of pain you feel when you are very, very sad. It was like that intense physical feeling, not entirely unpleasant, that you get when you are sad beyond words, the feeling that lodges right between your heart and your stomach. Only this feeling was misplaced, it wasn't where it should be between my heart and my stomach, it was just above my heart, where I had gotten hit by a wet beanbag a second ago. That is when I knew I was dying, because if I were going to live, I would be feeling much more intense pain, not this sadness, this longing. I was utterly amazed, as all people who die prematurely or of unnatural causes must feel, because holy shit I can't possibly really be dying, right? The amazement mixed with the sadness, and it was an entirely new emotional experience for a 23 year-old man. And that is the last thing I remember thinking, how strange this combination of feelings was, because right then I died. I didn't wake up. At least not right away. But that was the end of the dream, the end of my life was the end of my dream. When I finally woke up, I remembered the entire sequence as I have described it. The dream felt just as real as the most intense nightmare I have ever had, but instead of horror, the overriding emotions involved were, again, sadness and amazement. It was entirely outside of my realm of experience, even after the fact. It was different than when my grandfather died. It was different than when my uncle and cousin died in the plane crash. I never imagined myself being sad at my own death. Everyone faces their own mortality sometime in their life, and I remember being sad <EM>thinking </EM>about what I would miss after I died, but depressed at the moment of death? It just seemed unnatural. And yet apparently it is natural enough to make my unconscious mind tell me that at the moment of my death, my real death, I will indeed feel an overwhelming sadness. I don't know whether I am more scared of dying than ever before, or if I am actually curious enough to be excited about the prospect. I didn't write about this immediately because I kept thinking (hoping) that the dream would recur, that maybe I would remember more of it the second time. But the dream has not returned and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I will never feel that ridiculous mixture of amazement and sadness again until the moment I die.</P>

"event","Some quick thoughts, just to stave off complete mental atrophy:


Alaska sucks. No really, it does. The money is good, but the cost of living is so high that you really can't live on less than $15/hour. If it weren't for the fact that I do absolutely nothing, ever, I wouldn't be saving any money. As it is, between paying my dad rent and paying my mom and grandmother back, I haven't put nearly as much in the bank as I thought I would have by now. A few random notes from the Arctic:

-My entire diet consists of frozen pizza, hamburger helper, pop-tarts and Tang;

-It's really fucking cold here;

-The only days anybody goes out up here are Friday and Saturday nights. I have to work on Saturday and Sunday mornings. 8am. This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't live with the GM of the company I work for. The GM has strict ideas on how much sober rest a person needs before they work around airplane propellors in the morning. Can someone explain to my dad that I am a very high-functioning drunk? While we are on the subject, moving in with my dad could be the worst life-decision I have ever made. He is the roommate from Hell. There is no even ground with him, so I never know where I stand. I am alternately his son, roommmate and employee, whichever most suits him at the moment. He charges me rent, yet he lords over the house as if I were still 12. I perform virtually all daily household chores. He has not done the dishes since I got here. He recently told me that there a million things I do on a daily basis that drive him nuts, including putting the toilet paper rolls on the dispenser backwards. Are you kidding me? I drive YOU nuts? I pay you rent, yet I can't watch TV while you are trying to sleep. It's miserable. He also has the oh-so popular habit of pointing out every single one of your shortcomings to you whenever he gets the chance. And to his friends. And to attractive girls you might happen to be talking to in a bar. ""Hey, this is my son, did you know he keeps a bottle of Everlcear on his nightstand?"" Yea, that's a great ice-breaker. Thanks dad. I really can't move out soon enough;

-The (very) few girls worth knowing in this town have already been passed around like a bong at a Bar Harbor house party. 
 Me: ""Hmm, Anna seems like a nice girl.""
 Person at bar: ""Yea she is. Your dad hooked up with her.""
 Faaaaaaaaaantastic;

-After March 17th, nobody plays basketball again until November. Nobody.






All of a sudden, Bangor is looking pretty good."

"event","I went to the movies with Amber tonight. We saw Meet the Fockers. I knew it was going to be funny because Justin said it wasn't. Kid is like a goddam reverse-axis joystick. Hey-yo! Anyways, it was funny. After the movie we went over to her house and drank some beers with her roommate and her ""ex""-boyfriend. He might be the biggest tool I have ever met. Ok, maybe not ever, but definitely the biggest tool I have met since I left Bar Harbor. He is ex-military, gelled-wave-hair, training-to-be-a-cop Grade A New England Tool. I actually warned Amber not to let me get too drunk because I was worried that I would get my ass kicked by this goofball. Here is a rundown of some of the things that were discussed/said by this bastion of male intelligence:

His choice of television shows:
-""Cops is the best show ever.""
-After I voiced my opinion that I would like to see a show where the ""bad guys"" get away: ""They can't have that show, because these dumb niggers will never learn that you can't outrun a radio.""
-On an overweight cop trying to scale a wire fence: ""It's fuckin' hard to do that when you're carrying around an extra 50lbs.""
-Me, on same cop: ""Yea, looks like he's been to Dunkin' Donuts once or twice.""
-Him again: ""Yea, those utility belts, they've got so much cool stuff on 'em, they weigh like 50lbs.""
-Me: ""Oh yea. The utility belts.""

His choice of celebrities:
-""Dude, Nick Lachey is the fuckin' man. He is real. He doesn't give a shit.""
-Me: ""Wow, Nick has some really cool tattoos. What is that, a tribal barbed wire armband?""
-Him: ""I don't know a lot about tattoos, but that is fuckin' sweet. I want to get one like that.""
- ""Ashlee Simpson is so much cooler than Jessica Simpson.""
- ""Ashlee and Jessica's mom is a fuckin' bitch.""

Random quotes:
- ""I had to drive 3 fuckin' hours in the (police academy?) uniform. When I got here, it didn't last 2 minutes. Fourth minute, it was fuckin' gone.""
- ""California sucks. The people are assholes, there's too much traffic, and the weather sucks. Florida is way better.""
- ""Seriously, this show (The Family Guy) takes place in Providence. I know it's a fake town called Quohog, but the landscape is definitely Providence.""
- ""I can't wait til I get back out to sea, I swear I'll be back in shape in 3 weeks flat. BOOM!""



I wish I were making this all up. There was a lot more, but I can't remember it all word-for-word. It should be noted that Amber's roommate Katie (the tool's ex-girlfriend) was rolling her eyes behind his back and agreeing with me every time I contradicted him or called him out. Then as soon as I left, I could see them making out through the window. My God, girls are so dumb. 


Another note from tonight:
When I got online, I clicked on the link in my sister's AIM profile to bring up Explorer. Straight to her livejournal, lo and behold. Couldn't help reading a little. Wish I hadn't. Jordan, if you're reading this, I'm obviously not going to tell any other family members, since I have almost as much incriminating entries in my journal as you do in yours. At least I'm 23. 

Another thing, if this whole entry seems a bit off-kilter from my normal writing style, it's because the last thing I read was my sister's entries. I'm like a fucking sponge, I am so easily influenced by other people's styles. She is a very good writer (shit, I was proud), in the classic teenage-diary style. 




Last note: Tomorrow (today, actually) is New Year's Eve. Don't know where I'll end up, but I promise to make a full report on Saturday. Hilarity should ensue."

"event","So I guess for the next 30 minutes or so (or until my ADD kicks in), I'm just going to write pretty much whatever comes into my head. Right now I am scanning old pictures, talking to Channa and writing in my livejournal. Earlier I was watching cartoons and drinking all the alcohol I had leftover from last weekend. Last weekend, James and I went to Bangor/Orono to hang out with Justin, because he has been going through some rough times lately. So Friday night we went to his new place in Oldtown, right next to the redemption center. His roommates were having a party that night. James, Justin and I started out by drinking a bottle of tequila in 20 minutes, then we switched over to beer. Pretty soon the house was chock full of bleach-blonde college freshmen, male and female. It was not a little uncomfortable. Even my brother was there. Pardon me, my friend's girlfriend from Alabama keeps text-messaging me while I try to write this. So we're at this party, and I am pretty drunk, so about the only thing I remember is peeing outside because the bathroom line is too long, and talking to a girl with braces that my brother introduced me to. Eventually Charlene's sister Sue came and picked me up, but she didn't want to stay and party, so we went back to her house. We watched movies for a little while. I asked her why she came and got me, and she said because she didn't want me to have to sleep in my car. Apparently I told her I was sleeping in my car that night. It probably would have happened too, because the party was out of control, and there was really nowhere to sleep. So I ended up sleeping on Charlene and Sue's couch. The next morning I woke up when James called me, and he came over and we hung out and talked to Charlene and her roommate Anna for a while. Then we left and had lunch with James' parents and Justin. After that we went to see Blade Trinity. James and I thought it was good, but Justin didn't like it. After the movie we went back to Justin's house, and from there we went to the Bear Brew. I was broke, so I volunteered to be DD. We met Mary and Kat and Candice at the Bear Brew, and some drunk fat girls tried to pick us up. Justin bought them shots because it was one of their birthday's and then we went to Ushuaia's. Candice paid for me to get in because I was broke, and she needed a ride. At Ushuaia's, it was the usual meat market. Lot's of high school girls trying (and usually succeeding) to hook up with UMO football players. This makes the college football sluts angry and resentful, so they hook up with frat boys, hockey players and baseball players to try to make the football players jealous, but the football players don't care because they are hooking up with the high school girls. I'll never let my sister go to Ushuaia's. James and I sit and watch the high school girls dance while Justin dances with Mary and Kat and tries to find his ex-girlfriend's friends so they can see how happy he is without her. Kat tries to talk to James and I, but we are clearly uninterested. A fat drunk girl hugs me and asks me if I know where her friends are. I tell her that I think they are in the refridgerator in the kitchen, but I don't think she hears me. We leave without Candice because we can't find her. The next day I drive home and barely make it because I don't have enough money on my debit card to buy gas. It's ok though, because I start working at Ruby Tuesday at the South Portland mall tomorrow night. I haven't worked at Ruby Tuesday since April, but they don't care and they scheduled me to serve right away. My hand is still too weak to make a fist, so I have no idea how I will carry multiple plates, but I don't care because I need the money to buy my family Christmas presents. Tonight I drank a little bit of vodka and coke and a beer left over from the weekend. I also had one of my last hydrocodienes, leftover from when I broke my hand 7 weeks ago. Altogether I am disappointed because I am already losing my buzz. Being a drunk writer must be expensive, because apparently writing is very sobering. What a ripoff. I was talking to Mary a little while ago, and I sent her some pictures, but she has stopped responding. I can only assume that she is either having sex or watching Sex in the City. I am signing off now because I am losing my buzz and I am going to go and check my fantasy basketball stats and take another hydro, in no particular order. Goodbye."

"event","Damn. It's been over a year. Haven't had regular internet access in all this time, so obviously the journal was one of the first casualties. No worries though, your faithful scribe is back in action. Maybe. It all depends on how much patience I have for typing new entries with my left hand. You see, my right hand was unjustly cut off due to a misunderstanding in a marketplace in Calcutta. But no, I jest. Here is a brief rundown of what I've been up to for the last year:

Moved to Bangor;
Worked at Ruby Tueday's;
Lived with Justin;
Got drunk a lot;
Met some cool people;
Met some douchebags;
Didn't go back to school;
Moved to Bar Harbor in June;
Worked at Rup's;
Lived with James, Justin, Jess, Bud, Erik, Kyle and Meagan;
Got drunk a lot;
Did some other stuff;
Didn't save any money;
Had a lot of fun;
Played flag football with Jonesy every Sunday in the fall;
Watched the Red Sox beat the Yankees;
Went to Boston and hung out around Fenway for game 2 of the World Series;
Broke my hand while celebrating the Red Sox winning the World Series;
Had surgery to place two pins in my broken hand;
Moved home to Portland to mooch off my mom until my hand heals and I can move to Alaska.


There's obviously a lot of stuff I did in between, but I am really fuckin tired of typing with my left hand. More later perhaps. Feel free to drop me a line. Same ol' screennmame."

"event","I haven't really felt like writing much the past couple of weeks. This has mostly been due to the fact that my life has become fantastically chaotic, and I've been busy trying to salvage some semblance of consitency within my day-to-day life. Instead of writing about all the things that have gone horribly wrong recently, I'd like to try to put into words my often-misunderstood attitude towards women. 

Let's start by making one thing clear: I love women. No matter what some miserable, condescending, pseudo-intellectual, Jane Austen-reading, hairy-armpitted, frigid feminazi twats who go to a certain unnamed Ivy League school in New Haven, Connecticut might say about me, I love everything about girls. Well, almost everything. There are, of course, some girls I know whom I think would make wonderful poster-children for abortion. But there are a lot of guys I know who fall into the same category. Girls actually have a much better chance of getting to know me than guys do, since at this point in my life I have no desire whatsoever to make any new friends. I am certainly not opposed to getting laid, however. As long as I think I have a chance of scoring with you, I'll be your best goddam friend. That isn't to say that I'll be EVERY girl's best friend. If this makes me an asshole, then so be it, but at some point in our lives we have to be honest with ourselves, and I can honestly say that I am not attracted to big girls. Nothing personal, I am just not sexually attracted to them. Therefore, any fat girls I meet automatically fall into the same category as any guys I meet. That is, I have no use for them. I already have a wonderful group of friends, and I don't want anymore of them. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is. Now, some of you may be wondering whether or not you qualify as a ""big girl"". Well, chances are that if you had to ask, you probably ARE. If you're still not sure, here are some guidelines that will help you determine whether or not I would find you attractive:

- I don't like girls who have been cut off at Sizzler's;
- I don't like girls whose blouse could double as a Sunfish sail in a pinch;
- I don't like girls whose breasts rest comfortably on their stomachs;
- I don't like girls who are mostly responsible for the removal of chair-desk combos in public schools;
- I don't like girls who have to read the weight restrictions in elevators before they get on.

The list goes on, but I think you get the general picture. Before you condemn me as an insensitive prick (which I will neither confirm nor deny), ask yourself this: are you attracted to really short guys? Or guys with really small penises? Well then, since I don't discriminate against short girls or girls with small vaginas, then I don't think you should judge me. I just don't like fat girls in that way. That's all.

But I digress. Instead of focusing on the negatives, let's try accentuating the positive for a change. I really do like women, especially the attractive ones. And despite the fact that, as a man, I have been socially programmed to expect all women to look like the girls in Maxim, I am comfortable with the girls I meet every day, and really strongly attracted to a lot of them. The most beautiful girls, in my opinion, are the ones who are naturally beautiful. I'd be lying if I said that I wouldn't have sex with the bleached-blonde frat-mattresses that one often meets at college, but I think the girl in the hoodie from the party last week in Orono (who unfortunately has a tool for a boyfriend) is damn near irresistible. I think Jessica Alba is quite possibly the hottest girl on Earth. I love the idea of the girl next door. I think glasses are sexy as hell. Seriously, I am not very snooty when it comes to chicas. That whole ""gentlemen prefer blondes"" thing is rubbish to me. Give me a cute brunette with a nice personality anyday. Speaking of personality, I absolutely covet this trait in women. Unfortunately, it's so rare (in anybody really, male or female) that I have pretty much stopped actively searching for it. Now at this point some of you might be thinking, well, if you gave fat girls a chance, you might be surprised to find that they have a lot of personality. Well, a monkey in a clown suit might have a lot personality too, but I wouldn't know because I'm not attracted to the little fuckers. If I'm going to nail a girl she has to be physically attractive, not interesting. If you think that your boyfriend doesn't feel the same, then you are VERY sadly mistaken. That's why borderline-attractive girls wait until they get the engagement ring before they throw on the extra 15-20 pounds they've been hiding at the gym. Girls know that once they have a $5,000 ring on their finger, they basically have a license to be themselves, as opposed to the person they were portraying for dating's sake. Trust me, this happened to a friend of mine. So if you're thinking about popping the question to that special girl, make sure you do your research to avoid any surprises of this sort. The old what-does-her-mother-look-like trick works sometimes, but it can be misleading. The best thing to do is to imagine what she would look like if she DOES add 20lbs. If you can do that and come up with a clear mental picture, you might be in trouble. If you can't even concieve of what she would look like with the added weight, then congratulations, you've got yourself a keeper. 

Alright, I keep going off on tangents, so I am going to try to wrap this up. Basically, if you're marginally attractive and not fat, drop me a line sometime.

"event","Sorry for the journalistic blackout last week. Shit was going down that you faithless fucks don't need to know about. Unless you're one of the select few whom I consider to be a friend. In that case, you already know what was going down, and I don't have to waste anymore Carpal Tunnel Syndrome here explaining it. I will write about the Steve Mardigan issue before too long, but I would like the whole situation to be reselved before I tackle it. For the moment, however, I would like to attempt to create a timeline of the past weekend's events. The accuracy of this timeline is in no way guaranteed, and if you notice any ommissions, exaggerations or other fuck-ups, feel free to leave corrections in the Comments page. Alrighty then, here we go...

FRIDAY-
10:00pm: James and I depart Portland;

SATURDAY-
12:02am: James and I arrive at Mike and Jib's apartment in Orono and promptly funnel a beer each;

12:10-2:00: James and I drink all of the following: At least 2 more funnels, an Irish Carbomb, 4-5 shots of assorted alcohol and 2-3 random beers. It should be noted that at one point James funneled what amounted to an Irish Carbomb (if you're wondering what that would look like, try to imagine somebody funneling Cottage cheese and Apple juice);

2:00-3:00: James and I wander around the apartment complex, trying to find Sarah and Bethany's apartment. After at least one incorrect guess, we find what we THINK is their apartment, and take the microwave out of the kitchen and back to Mike and Jib's kitchen;

3:00-5:30: I fall asleep on the couch. James tries to crawl into bed with Mike, and is promptly kicked out. He then falls asleep in the hallway, before Mike finally has pity on him and leads him downstairs to the fouton;

11:00am: James wakes up and drives home to Ellsworth. Mike and I order pizza;

1:00pm: Mike and I drive to Ruby Tuesday's in Brewer, where I fill out an application and he has an interview,

4:30pm: Mike and I give up on waiting for James to return and go to the Fieldhouse to play basketball. There is a Gay/Jewish convention or something in the Fieldhouse, so we shoot around on the other court for a while, then leave. On the way out, Mike steals a Powerade from a little kid;

5:30-8:30: We relax and watch baseball before the night's festivities. The Giants lose Game 4 (and the series) to the Marlins. I announce to the Press (Mike and Jib) that I am officially retiring from following baseball;

8:30: Mike mixes the first drinks of the evening, something he calls a Mai Tai Martini. Despite serious misgivings about the relative straightness of drinking a Mai Tai Martini, I give it a shot and decide it is of surpassing quality. Mike gets props from the room;

9:00: Sarah comes over and ask if we have her microwave. She returns the microwave to her own apartment, then returns with Bethany and her boyfriend Chris;

9:30-10:30: Jib and I play beer die against Bethany and Chris. I am the only one drinking hard alcohol instead of beer. As a result of this, my defense is porous, but I do manage to keep us in the game with two plunks. Eventually however, Bethany and Chris pull out the victory;

11:00pm-SUNDAY morning: I have no recollection of time from this point on, but the rest of the night went something like this...
Josh comes over;
Red Sox beat the A's;
Mike does not drink much because he is still hung over;
Some random neighbor tries his first funnel and pukes before he has even a full gulp down;
I find some clips of Tara Reid naked on the internet and show them to a grateful Josh;
Some attractive but depressingly stupid Cosmetology students come over from next door to play beer die;
I try to start a game of flip cup, but none of the newcomers want to play;
I denounce them as boring and leave to drink more;
Sarah and I cook Jib's steak tips on the Hibachi;
I have many drunken cell phone conversations;
I talk to some girl online and claim to be the long-lost Jason E. Gorneault. After claiming my dominance over said girl's virginity, I have my life threatened by her football player friend;
I tell both the girl and the friend to eat shit and I fall asleep on the couch;

SUNDAY-
11:00am-11:00pm: Mike and I watch close to 12 consecutive hours of football;
11:00pm: James finally returns and we drive back to Portland.



There it is. Nothing too exciting, but it was fun nonetheless. Made some friends, made more enemies, got pretty drunk. It should be noted that at NO time on Saturday night was Chris separated from Bethany for more than 30 seconds at a time. They were seen on at least one occassion emerging from the bathroom together. Anyways, it's nap time, probably. I have a serious sleep debt to repay."

"event","Today's thoughts are on something that is very near and dear to every guy's heart, but they probably have never realized it, or thought about it in exact terms. Before I begin, however, allow me to provide a little background info what led me to this epiphany...

Wednesday night, Justin and I went to Megan's 22nd birthday party in Gardiner. In the woods. The deep woods. Her parent's house is beautiful, though. So when we got there, the party was already in full swing. Her parents were there, as well as a few girlfriends, a lot of guy friends, and her younger sister. So my immediate assessment was that the younger sister was off limits, and Megan was the center of way too much attention. So that left two girls, one pretty cute, the other a project (a project is defined as a girl who requires the consumption of at least 5 beers before she appears seriously attractive). This entire assessment takes less than 5 seconds to make, as it would any guy. So the first hour or so of the party is dedicated to getting a good buzz on, becoming friendly with the guys at the party, and testing the water with the females. So after a little while, it became clear that the cute girl was not drinking and therefore immune to drunken advances (as well as having an attitude which clearly stated that any drunken advances would be met with EXTREME hostility), and the other girl was taken by one of the many guys at the party. Realizing this, there was nothing left for me to do but proceed to get sloppy drunk. And that, my friends, is when it hit me...

Every single coed party one attends has a fixed turning point for guys. That moment occurs when you have to decide whether you want to continue your quest to get laid, or scrap it and get hammered with your friends. From that point on, there is no middle ground. You have to either maintain a steady buzz and keep making eye contact with that cute brunette with the halter top, or saddle up and start chugging. Since I am truly awful at making girls like me over a short period of time, I usually end up pursuing the latter option. For other guys, the line is drawn at different places. James has the capability to hook up with girls fairly easily, but he would rather focus on incredible feats of drinking, and thus uses high standards as an out clause. Mark is on the other end of the spectrum, and would go to great lengths for a piece of ass. Therefore it has to be a truly pathetic female situation for him to admit defeat and really tie one on. Our other friends fall at various places between those two, with the exception of Mike, who goes to every party with the intention of getting really shitfaced, and anything after that is just gravy for him. The occasional exception occurs when a large number of us get together and all go to the same party. Oftentimes, the herd mentality will kick in early as we all try to outdrink each other out of the gate, and end up getting uselessly trashed. To me, these are really the best times, since comraderie skyrockets as social responsibilities plummet. And more often than not, one or two of us will end up getting some action anyways, because for some reason, girls have always been strangely attracted to our group. I don't know if it is our overall level of attractiveness (which is fairly high), or our overwhelming drinking prowess. Probably some combination of both, with comraderie playing the X-factor. I think a lot of girls are attracted to guys who exhibit strong loyalty and friendship. Well, since I have strayed pretty far from the original point, I will close this out by saying this: keg party in Portland tomorrow. The over-under on my moment of truth is 11:01pm. Place your bets in the comments section.

Goodnight."

"event","Something's been bugging me for a while now. I read a lot, and I watch a lot of movies, and I've noticed a disturbing trend when it comes to describing a person's EYES. You probably haven't noticed this, because you're probably not as observant or compulsively bored as I am, but eyes- and specifically eye color- are always described in the exact same manner. If a person has BLUE eyes, they are described as ""piercing"". If a person has BROWN eyes, they are described as ""soft"". Here's an example:

""His piercing blue eyes stared straight into the depths of her soul, and she was forced to turn away. She closed her soft brown eyes as a tear trickled slowly down her cheek.""

Now I just made that up, but it could have come from any book or movie script ever written. What I want to know is who the HELL decided that ALL blue eyes are piercing and ALL brown eyes are soft. I think that is a goddam unfair bias. To further perpetuate the bias, green eyes are pretty much left out entirely, except when they are described as being ""bright"". Ooooh, bright green eyes. How intoxicating. They might as well be fucking desk lamps. Anyways, I digress. I don't really give a shit about green eyes. My beef is with the blue and brown. Now, I have brown eyes, and I have actually been told MANY times how beautiful my SOFT brown eyes are. Fuck that! My eyes aren't soft. They're hard and penetrating. I have PIERCING BROWN EYES, goddamit. But do you see how wrong that looks? Here it is again: piercing brown eyes. It has no ring to it at all, thanks to hundreds of years of conditioning people to think of BLUE eyes as piercing and BROWN eyes as soft. It's worse than racism. Soft blue eyes doesn't sound as wrong as piercing brown eyes, but it still doesn't sound quite right. I blame that mostly on the Nazis, who insisted that blue eyes (along with blonde hair) were the trait of a genetically superior race. Ever since then, blue eyes have been regarded as highly preferable over even the softest of brown eyes. You may be saying to yourself right now, ""That's not true, my boyfriend/girlfriend/father has brown eyes, and I like them more than anything!"" Well, you're lying to yourself. Take whoever it is in your life that has brown eyes, give them blue eyes, and marvel at the vast fucking improvement. Amazing, isn't it? I think the goddam Nazis should still be paying reparations for this little social debacle. Christ almighty. Ok, I am taking my PIERCING BROWN EYES to class now, where I will take on all comers in a staring contest. Bring it on, swine!

"event","What a weird week it has been. I can't even put my finger on anything specific, it's just been... strange. I think I really need to jumpstart this writing thing. I want to make some money, and I want to get the hell out of Maine. I want to go back to the Caribbean and lay on the beach all day... no responsibility, no drama, no worries. Fuckin A, I have been missing my old friends so much lately. It's not even that the people up here are bad, no, that's not true. I love the friends I have made since I have been here. But it's so different. Everything is different. I miss skipping class to go to the beach in February. I miss hanging out in the Common Area at CFB. I miss being friends with almost everyone in my school. I miss my friends and I making scorecards and rating the incoming students as they line up to get their ID photos taken. I miss my ""Famly"", Jason, Veron, Hashim, Clem and Val. I miss flirting with Candi and Cleo. I miss hanging out at the airport, waiting to fly home after school. I miss Carnival. I miss being able to get away with anything because all the teachers loved us. I miss leaving the clubs at 6am. Goddamit, I miss it all so much. I swear to God, I am going back. Fuck winter. Fuck frat boys and dumb girls. Fuck my shitty school. Fuck cold water and dirty, overcrowded beaches. Fuck 9-5 and fuck waiting tables. Fuck rush-hour traffic. Fuck McDonald's and Burger King. Fuck your expectations. Fuck Abercrombie and Fitch. Fuck the Red Sox and Yankees. Fuck snow and icy rain. Fuck it all. I want to go back."

"event","I am tired, but I don't want to sleep.
I am hungry, but I don't want to eat.
I am thirsty, but I don't want to drink.
I am lonely, but I want to be alone.
Are you sensing the fucking pattern here?
What's wrong with me? I feel fine, but I also feel like shit.
I feel a headache coming on, but it will never get here.
I feel loved and hated at the same time.
I know that I am loved, but I would rather be hated.
That's stupid, nobody wants to be hated.
Do they?
I want to be hated so that I may feel sorry for myself.
And so that others may pity me also.
When they're not hating me, that is.
My life is comfortably awful.
""I will show you fear in a handful of dust.""
I hate poetry, but T.S. Eliot could grow on me.
Robert Browning also.
I want to be a warrior, but I am always afraid.
I have a very high pain threshold.
I think.
I think too much.
Ignorance is bliss.
I'm not as smart as I think I am.
And unfortunately, I am smart enough to know it.
I wish I had an Amy to chase.
What the hell am I talking about?
I've chased enough Amys in my life to know that they don't really exist.
So the question is, how long before I settle...?
Settle for the silver medal.
Haha, that rhymed.
I'll hate myself if I settle.
Wait, I already hate myself.
Self-loathing is innate in my family.
And by family, I mean my literary brethren.
I don't know what the fuck I am talking about anymore. 
I lost it about 10 lines up.
Goodnight."

"event","So last night I was kicking around on the internet when I decided to go to DSIS and check out my student bill, just for shits and giggles. Well, imagine my surprise when I saw that according to USM, I was in debt to the tune of over $3,600. Upon further review, I noticed that the majority of this outrageous sum was billed to my account for ""Out-of-State Undergraduate Tuition"". My initial impulse was to fly into a white-hot rage and throw my computer out my bedroom window. Then I realized this would effectively end what now passes for my social life, so I calmed down and thought the situation through logically. Upon reaching a satisfactory solution in my mind, I played 3 hours of Madden and went to sleep.

The next morning after Injun Studies class, I walked to the Student Billing office and asked, in a polite manner, what the fuck was going on. The peon who was working the desk was apparently intimidated by my swarthy Arabic features (and possibly the 6 kilos of TNT strapped to my chest), and immediately referred me to her aged supervisor. The old witch had apparently stared death in the face before, because she somehow- despite being roughly 4'6""-  managed to stare down her nose at me as she declared that I had been sent a letter in January informing me of the temporality of my in-state residency status. Upon hearing this, a great rage began to boil in the depths of my stomach, but I held it in check long enough to tell her that I had recieved no such letter. She then turned away from me without a word, and proceeded to shuffle through a file cabinet until she found said letter, complete with my name and permanent address. This was the proverbial straw that broke the camel-jockey's back. All the years of bureaucratic cluster-fucks and miles and miles of red tape that I had endured during my 3 semesters at USM finally cried out for vengeance, and I snatched the offensive letter away from her, crumpled it into a ball, and savagely consumed it. Then, with a great, echoing war cry, I leapt over the counter and delivered a roundhouse kick right to the witch's dome. She staggered back against the filing cabinet, but recovered quickly and drew from her billowing dress a great axe. I saw in her eyes the madness of battle, but I was unmoved and unafraid, for the fever had gripped me also. I threw down my Ellis Oxford shirt, revealing the Great Blade fastened to my back, opposite the TNT. I unsheathed it slowly (for effect), and beckoned to the witch:
""Come now, Hag of Infinite Bureaucracy, and taste my steel!""
""Insolent whelp!"" she replied coldly. ""Either fill out these forms in triplicate or to the Dark Abyss I shall send thee!""
I laughed haughtily at her and brandished my sword. ""Fie on your forms, and fie on you as well. No longer shall the cold shackles of Inept Public Service bear me down on my quest for knowledge. Have at thee, succubus!""
No sooner had I finished speaking than she let out a fearsome screech and swung her axe in a great, looping arc. I easily dodged her blow and countered with one lightning-fast jab to her torso. She was caught unawares in the midst of her backswing, and my blade bit deep. The axe fell from her hand and clattered to the floor. She was silent as she slid slowly from the end of my sword and to her knees, for her legs no longer had the strength to support her. She looked upon me with venomous eyes, for she had lived long and never before tasted the bitterness of defeat. Before I ended her hate-filled life, I spoke these words to her:
""Shouldn't have stepped to my shit, bitch. You just got GOT."" And with that last I hewed her head from her body, thus ending her terrible reign of ineffiecency. I placed her head upon the handle of her axe, and leaned it carefully in the corner by the door. I glanced over at the peon, who was cowering underneath a desk.
""I expect my billing situation to be resolved by the end of the business day. Farewell."" And I strode from the office to much applause from my fellow students."

As you can see, it was a very eventful night. I think that was the second-fastest blackout I've ever recorded, at just under 2 hours. Tops on the list of course is the infamous Pancake Social night. That probably deserves it's own entry, though. In fact, I know it does. Just not right now. Because I am damn lazy. I don't even know how or why I keep this journal. It's very uncharacteristic. Jesus, who am I pretending to be? AAAAAHHHHH!"

"event","I think I may have said this before, but people piss me off. Seriously. When I sign up for a FICTION class being offered by the ENGLISH department of my school, I don't expect to sit in class for over an hour talking about Indian fables and listening to shitty recordings of extinct languages nobody understands off the Professor's laptop. If I wanted to do that, I would have registered for INJUN STUDIES, or something of the sort. I have no fucking doubt that such a course is offered. USM has no semblance of a Journalism department or major, but if you want to take Fundamentals of Easter Island Conch Shell Instruments, this is the school for you. The worst part about taking a ""Fiction"" class at USM is that it will be populated by a bunch of pseudo-intellectual neo-hippie Emo types who think that every sentence of every paragraph of every assigned book has a profound and deeply spiritual meaning. Give me a fucking break. The authors of these books wrote them for the same reason that I am someday going to write them: to make a buttload of money. The difference between myself and said authors is that at some point they realized that the only way to make serious money in this business is to sell out and cater to the same ignorant peasants who eagerly devour their works in their search for understanding of their thouroughly meaningless lives. I swear to God, if I hadn't made a point of not eating breakfast this morning, I would have puked in the middle of the discussion about Traditional Indian Horse-Thieving. What the hell does that have to do with fiction? I'll tell you one thing, the tradition of me hating everybody is alive-and-fucking-well. The thing that pisses me off the most is that this is a fucking STATE SCHOOL! What happened to the days when you could rest comfortably in the knowledge that all of your classmates would be washed-up jocks and blonde girls with fake tans who are one semester of Horizontal Fraternity Studies away from Beauty School. Now you have to deal with a bunch of dirty-footed white boys with dreadlocks and girls with hairy armpits and chips on their shoulders the size of Rosie O'Donnell, all of whom are pissed off that their rich parents refused to send them to a private school in Vermont to study the Ecology of Whales.

Ahhh fuck it. I just thought about the cute girl in Math that I am going to sit next to today, and I lost most of my rage. I'm sure something will set me off later though. More to follow..."

"event","A Rundown on what has happened the last few nights...

Thursday:
- First official dorm parties of the year. Was I there? Yes, I was. Started in 204 Phillippi (sic? I don't give a shit), Erin and Kelly's room. 3 out of 4 girls in that room are dating frat boys. Relatively nice ones, but still. And the 4th is trying to hook up with frat boys. Wow. Anyways, I hung out there for a while and watched football with Erin's boyfriend, Garrett. Mmmm football. After the game they all decided to go down to ""the House"", so I wandered over to Robie. Amber, Sarah and Erin were hangin out on the stoop. I still had a few beers in my pocket, so Erin and I went behind Robie to drink them. Amber got mad at me for that. I don't understand all the tension that always seems to be floating around those girls. Was I really ever a freshman? Sheesh. After the beer, I hung out on the stoop to sober up for a while, then drove home.

Friday:
- Bought books for web programming and Fiction - The Genre. Total cost: $160. What the fuck. As if they don't rape you enough on tuition, you have to spend an assload of money on books, too. I hate higher education. Later, my brother had his first football game of the season. They beat South Portland 19-7. Josh hardly played though. I think his hamstring is still bothering him. James came down, and after the game we went out to the dorms with my other brother, Gabe, to try and find something to do. We stopped at the Can Depot on the way and got some beer, which we transferred to a goofy-looking Hipster style tote bag. First we went to Robie-Andrews, and met up with Amber, Sarah and Erin on the stoop. They didn't want to drink with us though. We hung out there for a little while and asked random people if they wanted to hang out. Most of them were already drunk though. Eventually, we walked over to Phillippi and tried to call some people we knew to let us in. Nobody was in their room, however. So we ended up loitering about the smoking area for a while. Gabe ripped the ""Yield to Pedestrians"" sign off it's post. We left after a while when nobody would let us in, because all the really lame RA's were working the front desk TOGETHER, for some reason. So we drove down to 7-11 and met some really drunk girls who asked us to come to a party with them. We followed them around for a while, but they had no idea where they were going. Eventually, we saw White Mike in the Sigma Nu driveway and talked to him for a while. He hadn't seen us for a long-ass time, but he still seemed more interested in the drunk girls that were with us. Man, some things never change. After that we gave the girls a ride home, since it was on our way home. We laid on the horn outside their house, just to make sure everybody inside knew they were stumbling home drunk at 2:30am. Then we drove home, not having drank any significant amount of alcohol. We still had fun though.

Saturday:
- Worked all day. Went to bed at midnight because I was Sofa King Tired.

Today:
- It's football time, baby! w00t! My day is booked solid with Beer, Buffalo wings aaaaaand Pigskin. Is there anything better than Sunday's in the Fall? Holy shit, I'm babbling. Time to go, Chris Berman is soliloquizing. Somebody pinch me, for chrissakes..."

"event","It was a long weekend. And not in the good ""I had more fun than you can usually stuff into one weekend"" kind of way. I worked 12 hours on Saturday and 12 on Sunday, with about 3 hours of sleep in between. I was straight rugglin. On Sunday I worked a traditional Jewish wedding. The ceremony was cool, and the bride and groom were pretty nice (the bride looked and acted like she was 16, but for some strange reason, it was more cute than annoying. Am I losing my misanthropic edge? I hope not), but the majority of the guests were old Jewish doctors and the like, all from New Jersey. If there's anything worse than 150 Dr. Rosenbaums all asking what's in the pear chutney while they get updates on the Yankees game on their cellphones, then I wouldn't wish it on Martha Burk. I did laugh my ass off when Matt said you could tell it was a Jewish wedding because there were only 2 gifts with about 15 signatures on each of them. I fucking lost it. That moment aside, though, I spent most of the day wishing my friends were there so we could spend the whole day making fun of the Hebrews. I'm pretty sure that 80 guys wearing white yarmulkas would have inspired us to comedic heights previously unimagined. That said, Matt was the only one there I felt comfortable telling racist jokes to, and even then I pretty much kept my peace. It's just not the same without my Brothers in Drinking. 

Christ I'm tired. I need to wake up early and register for classes. Surprise surprise, the DSIS online registration thingy is ""currently unavailable"". What a horrible fucking college I go to. I'm transferring to Orono in January. Get it engraved, fuckers."

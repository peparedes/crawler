So since last time not much has gone down.  I dissapointed myself again with the calc exam, which has pretty much cemented my grade in the class.  i need to do sweet on teh final if i'm going to stay sane.  Parents weekend was last weekend, so of course the Raubinger's came to Ann Arbor.  On Friday night we went out to dinner, and by a stoke of luck i found out that the lax team was having an inter-team scrimmage, so we went and watched that.  When the game was over, I had them take me back to my room so i could SLEEP.  Saturday was football against Northwestern, a blow out game, but the weather was nice, and i got Sarah a ticket so she could experience the greatness that is Michigan Football at the Big House.  After the game we walked around Ann Arbor for a while with Pat's family trying to find a place to eat.  We finally decided to go to the Ann Arbor Brewing Co.  We did have tickets for a jazz show, but we ended up not going since everyone was tired and they still had to drive home.  Plus, I had to go ""study"".  Anyway that night was pretty uneventful...a couple seniors from Troy High came up so i got to see them which was nice.  Sunday was a homework day, as it usually is.  That week was the same old stuff, until Thursday rolled around when it was 65 and sunny, my engineering lab got canceled, AND my pysch paper due date was changed utnil after vacataion!  All that jammed into one day.  It was sweet.  Then Friday i didn't do much, i wanted to do homework since people from state were coming up the next day and i wanted to get stuff out of the way, but i ended up watching mean girls with a bunch of girls (soooo funny) and going to bed early.  On saturday i worked out in the morning and got cleaned up to watch the U of M and OSU game...which was exciting in teh beginning, but then just got worse from there.  Oh well...at least we're still going to the Rose Bowl.  Sarah came up and caught the end of the game, and then we walked over to Anthony's room where Greg, Alex, Andrea, and Karianne were hanging out.  We stayed there for a while before me Sarah Alex and Greg went to the hockey game against MSU.  So exciting! I'm definitely getting tickets next year.  I haven't got all the cheers down yet, but i'll probably be going to more games so i'll get practice.  At night we stopped by michelle's b/c one of her roommates turned 21 earlier that week and they were having a little ""gathering"" to celebrate.  We stopped at another house over by the stadium, the one we've stopped at before games and stuff.  That was boring.  Walked home, went to bed.  Sunday it was all about the homework and group meetings and other shit that always pops up.  

Only 6 more hours of classes, no tests (thank God), two more days and i'll be home!!!

Can't wait to see all my friends!

Later

"event","Ok....soooo life is getting better i think.  aside from my midterms which i suck at.  I somehow did worse on the orgo exam, and only marginally better on psych.  I guess i really need to learn how to study, becuase my high school shenanigan's ain't cuttin it no more.  my parents have pretty much said they will be proud no matter what, but i was an A student in high school and this adjustment is rough. anywho....I GOT TO SEE BLAIN AND BRANDON ON FRIDAY.  That was so freakin awesome...it was like old times again and he hasn't changed a bit.  unfortunately they could only stay for friday night and went home early on saturday, but it was still sweet to hang out with them and mike carroll, who i haven't seen all year.  saturday i played in the ""Pig Skin Classic"" with some cool people from Bursley....it was a little two hand touch football tourney at mitchell.  Our team was sweet and we could have gone to the finals, but some team wanted to be dicks and argue about pointless stuff.  but i can't get too mad.  It was an absolutely perfect day out....barely a cloud in the sky and about 65 and WARM.  and i got a free t-shirt, which is always very cool.  So saturday night i stayed in to do homework and i spent most of sunday doing it too.  sunday i also had a MII meeting, which i thought was on the medical campus (business club meeting....medical campus....i know, i'm retarded) all becuase of a mix up with building names.  I am such a freshman. anyway, then i had dinner with my dad b/c he got a ticket for a basketball game.  so that was nice. and actually i got to see my mom and sarah since they were in town for a lax tourney thing.  so the whole family was here, and they'll be here again next weekend for parents weekend.  this week is going good so far...i have a bunch of stuff due next week include a paper for psych and engineering and a calc midterm....better start studying early!!!  ttyl

"event","This past week as been more of the same stuff.  Go to class, study, work out, sleep, stress out, repeat.  But....i would just like to say that in relieving this stress and some anger i had a kick ass weekend partyin it up.  Halloween and an exciting Michigan/Michigan State football game was a sweet combonation. Greg was in Ann Arbor for the weekend along with Jessie Lange, so i got to hang out with them, very cool.  Saturday and Friday night were awesome.  Friday was the first game for the 5th Scott Trough Droppers IM flag football team.  Even tho the other team didn't show up, we decdied to practice anyway.  Looks like i'll be the main receiver...had a couple good catches.  Friday's i went to michelle barbour's house party which was rocking.  Saw a couple people i hadn't seen in a while like nick gillett who was zorro.  I was a DJ.  My costume kicked major ass.  Anyway partied there for a while and then got a free ride back to markley from one of lisa's friends.  That was soooo cool since michelle's house is on south campus = a long ass walk at three in the morning.  Saturday, football game, extreme change in weather, but i stuck it out and stayed through all three  overtimes.  The Big House was absolutely crazy and i have never seen it so rowdy and loud before.  So after being there for five hours and went back to teh dorms, ate some food and got ready to head back out again.  I went to Sig Ep (aka the Troy High frat) with the 7 sexy fairies (ooh yeah ladies) and partied there for the night.  it was a troy high reunion, but i actually liked seeing people i know from other schools and even some i have yet to see this year at u of m if you can believe that.  After the party closed up a bunch of us chilled in my room for a couple hours before hitting the sack.  
Sunday i woke up early to do some work since i did absolutely nothing on friday and saturday. studied for orgo with henscie...midterm was today! i think i did alright.  i definately felt confident going in, even tho i was less that satisfied coming out.  i just need to do a lot better.  only one more midterm and the final to determine my grade!  anyways, psych midterm on thursday, which i'm so glad that it got moved from today.  someone in my class complained that they might have trouble getting to the polls to vote today if they had teh midterm, even tho it is taken during regular class hours..??????? but still, one less thing to get stressed about over the weekend.  Some bad news, our new engineering project is starting up, and as usual i'll be doing a lot of studying and spending time for this project.  i'm really starting to hate that class. anyway...fucking sweet news...brandon and blain are coming this friday!!!! OMG i as soo fucking geeked for this weekend.  i've only seen blain once since school started, and i was still at home when brandon moved up to school so needless to say i miss them incredibly and will love hanging out this weekend just like old times!!!  It's my motivation to bust my ass this week."

"event","ok....so i actually think i did good my math quiz on friday morning...like i knew all the questions.  Go figure.  So that was good, and then i worked out with dan...typical friday ritual.  then me, pat, josh, chris, rob, and steve went to look at some houses.  We found a couple that would be sweet for us and we are hoping to get one.  I am still not sure that i want to live in a house, it seems like a big decision to make so early in the year, esp when i don't hate living in the dorms.  so i have some thinking to do and if i decided to live in the dorms again, i'll probabaly have to find a replacement in the house for myself...just to be courteous.  so friday night i just chilled around the dorm, i didn't feel like going out, and plus i had to be up early the next morning to go to a freakin engineering review session.  i'm so scared this final will be impossible for me, so i wanted to go and see what i could get out of it, which ended up not being a whole lot.  after i got back to my room, my mom came all the way from troy to drive me to cedar point to meet up with pat and his faimly!!  it was an absolute blast, it rained almost the whole time, i rode top thrill dragster for the first time because we waited through all the rain, and eventually got up to be first in line for the front seat!  we were the first train to go up after they reopened.  We didn't come back down like some of the trains after us, much to pat's dissapointment, but it was still fuckin sweet.  126 mph. damn. and as it turned out, only four or five trains got to go before it started raining again! how bout that? And i got a picture! which i ended up losing in a haunted house becuase i had to girls practically ripping clothes off me with their death grip b/c they were so scared...BUT I FOUND IT! we went back later, and i cut in front of a bunch of people to go in by myself and look on the floor.  I actually asked every scary guy in there if they had seen in which was pretty crazy.  then i asked this one guy if he'd seen a coaster picture and he said ""what coaster"" and i'm like ""no fucking way""  he takes me in their back room, goes over to a table and picks my pictures up! OMG i was ecstatic.  it was  dirty from being stepped on, but i'm gonna leave it like that for nostalga. so i was feeling sweet after that.  we had gone in that haunted house earlier with some of pat's friends and their parents...three daughters....oh baby they were gorgeous. any way we hung out with then for a while, but they had to leave early b/c they weren't spending the night.  so after we parted pat and i rode millenium force in teh back car...definitely an experience after waiting for about an hour in teh freezing cold rain and wind.  but it was all worth it!!  WAAAAY WORTH IT!  after millenium we heading back to the room, picked up some food at fridays and watched saturday night live and went to bed.  the next morning we got up, ate breakfast and headed back to ann arbor becuase pat had ultimate frisbee practice, and now i'm just chilling!  apparently we are going to look at more houses this afternoon, and after that i'll probably study a while for my engineering final on tuesday.  wish me luck!!


Happy 18th Birthday Liz!!!!

"event","I have been so stressed out lately.  It seems like my life is one huge ass emotional roller coaster.  One minute i'm so happy, and then just like that i can be crying over a little insignificant thing.  It's so weird, i've never felt anything like this before.  But i truly thank god for my awesome family and friends who are always here for me, despite the distance we span.  They've really helped me through some tough decisions and rough times in the past six or seven weeks.  I'm dealing with things ok.  I'm finally getting on top of things, midterms are over except for my engineering one next week...which i have a terrible feeling could be incredibly difficult.  and it sucks i have no idea what my grade is in the class.  oh well...some hardcore studying for that this weekend...and cedar point with pat on saturday!!!  My mom is actually driving to ann arbor, taking me to cedar point, and then driving home so i can go to the review session for engineering saturday morning (wtf...great time for a review session...10am!) but yeah...so my mom rocks hardcore, although i feel bad for having her do that, even though she insisted.  but that's enough for now, i have to go to bed, only to wake up to a math quiz that i haven't studies for and will probably fail.  wish me luck anyway!

"event","hello to all...it's about time i started writing in this journal once again.  It's a good way to vent about all the things happening in my life right now...

so college rocks my world...yeah it's a lot of work and stress, but it is way cooler than high school.  I was one of those people you wanted to stay in high school forever, but things change and college is definitely the place to be.  We've been in school for about 6 weeks now and things are going well.  I have had a midterm every week for the past three weeks, including my calculus exam tonight.  I've met a ton of new people, even though i think i need to meet more.  all the guys i know on my floor are awesome, and i'm actually gonna be living with 5 of them next year in a house!  that's really exciting, especially since my parents left it up to me to decide what i wanted to do.

i went home last friday for troy's homecoming...i actually decided that i wanted to come home about 2pm on friday afternoon...but my mom had the day off and came up here to get me.  I had never really thought about going home until friday when someone popped it in my head that maybe i should go home...and i am sooo glad that i did.  I got to see all my friends from state and western that i haven't seen since they moved up.  it was really good to see blain, greg, alex, and all my other friends.  I also got to see people still in high school and talk to them which was awesome.  it felt a little wierd to be back at high school...it's just a different atmosphere, but it was great to see some old faces.

lately, i don't know what it is, but i have been extremely up beat and happy for the past few days....and let me assure you, it is NOT because of a certain significant event that coincidently happened a few days ago.  but anyways, the weather is great, sunny and a little cool...and it's fall! perfect weather for studying and reading outside...the leave are changing colors, the arb is as beautiful as ever, and i'm lovin life.

Well, the rumors are true. Sadly.

Apparently, there's not going to be a fourth season for South of Nowhere. Read about it just a little while ago from <a href=""http://www.afterellen.com/blwe/02-29-08?page=0%2C1"">AE</a> that it's been canceled. D:

It came as a shock, to say the least. 

As a fan, I find it hard to believe that the show is going to be over. As a person overall, in my heart, I feel that it's way too early for it to end so soon. In one way or another, despite all the character growth, depth, insights, tearful heartaches, and wonderful squeal-inducing memories that the show has shared with all of us, there's still much more to be explored by this ""groundbreaking"" television series. It moved us in ways we could never have expected, opened our eyes to certain realities in life that we may not have imagined ourselves understanding in the first place, and touched us more than we might have first expected. Hell, and it's not even 3 years old yet! Think of how much more it can accomplish. Let's face it, we <i>need</i> more South of Nowhere.

So, please, if you have the time, check out <a href=""http://www.savespashley.com/"">SaveSpashley.com</a>. The people there are very amazingly dedicated, and the number of testimonials and signatures in the petitions listed are simply...wow. It'll only take 5 minutes of your time, but any small voice will surely help.

I felt tired and sleepy all day, which is strange considering I went to bed around 10 PM last night. I woke up around 7 or 8 AM, so that's like 10 hours. Plus, I took an afternoon nap that lasted a little over 3 hours. That's about more sleep in a day than I ever had in the past few days! It's kind of bothersome, but I guess it's better than not sleeping at all. My whole body is still a bit warm though, it also aches all over, and I have the urge to cough every moment or so. Damn. I can't seem to get rid of the phlegm that easily.

Ah well. Maybe a few more hours of rest will sort everything out soon enough."

"event","Back, finally.

I never realized first year in college would have been this demanding and draining. Most of my classes have been fairly manageable so far. Thank goodness for good schedules. Lol. My current classes are usually around 3 to 4.5 hours long per day, from Monday to Thursday. I have Fridays off...although I do have CWTS every Saturday. x3 It's fun, nevertheless. We teach down at Valenzuela for our implementation project. We've been doing this for about 5 weeks now, and I just hope the kids would learn from us.

Anyway. LJ Update. Have a new layout up. Nothing too flashy or anything, but it does feature KonoSetsu. My <s>not so</s> new pairing fandom from Negima. It practically screams canon, damnit! X3

"event","So. Apparently, it's Sunday. Or more appropriately, in a few minutes, it's going to be Monday. And then, it'll be a couple of days until school finally starts. That'll be on a Wednesday, mind you. And since we had our orientation earlier this month so there will be no dilly-dallying around for the first day. So it'll be straight off to class we go... if we manage to remember which buildings are which, that is. XP

Ah... college. I guess it's finally time to say goodbye to high school.  For real this time around.

It's been roughly a little over a week since I came here to Batangas. And tomorrow, I'll be heading back to Manila before I can fully enjoy my <i>very</i> short vacation here. My grandparents still treat me like a little kid, but that's to be expected. This might be weird of me, but I love them all the more for it. As for my uncle, he's still as busy as ever. My cousins are still goofy.  And I had to help out with a couple of things with my uncle's work. It was fun though. It'll be a shame to leave so soon... but we can't have everything, after all. I can always visit during weekends though. Every once in a while. XP"

"event","Well, finally done it. Just arrived here in Manila some hours ago, bringing most of my necessary belongings, ready to enter the next phase in my life -- college.

Granted, I'm still not flying solo for the mean time, but pretty soon I should learn how to be more independent. My mom is taking some time off from her business to help me get settled in, which is really quite sweet of her. We're crashing in at a family friend's home for the meanwhile (thank God for the connection!) but we're supposed to meet up with some others after my enrollment.

Oh, I'll be enrolling on May 2, so we'll have tomorrow to look at the dormitories near the university. The nearer, the better. I think she has already reserved a slot for me at the closest one to our school, but I'm not sure... we still have to check the place out and stuff. But I'm willing to bet we'd end up taking that one.. ^^;

It's a bit scary, of course, and it's going to be my first time to be away from home for a long amount of time. Heck, my stomach is even acting up... you gotta love anxiety attacks. Nevertheless, it's exciting all the same. XP"

"event","Seeing the sun set and rise and doing much of nothing in between seems kind of... I don't know... unprolific?

I'm not very used to not having anything to do anymore. The past week before Holy Week had our whole class practically bouncing from party to party... I think almost every single group in the section held an 'after-graduation' party. Everyone was obliged to attend each one. So I guess I was used to that. Kind of strange, but certainly not unpleasant; in fact, it was all quite fun. 

After all, the whole class had grown quite close towards the end of the schoolyear. We probably won't be seeing much of each other so soon, considering how most of the people in the classroom would be going to the different campuses of UP and all the other universities they've been aiming for. But then again, that's what small reunions are for. ;)

One of my plans for this last high school summer break is to go back to playing tennis. I've been neglecting my out-of-school activities these past few months, and I'm really quite saddened by that. My coach tells me that I could still be able to play like I had before, after a few games, but I really doubt it. I've gained some weight over the time I've been so 'pre-occupied' by our so-called-important-research. But I do realize that it's basically my fault. 

Sigh. 

I guess it's back to working out for me again. This time, my goal's to get back in shape. It's so nice to have something to aspire for. *coughcough*"

In any case... school let out early today. It's not like we have anything else to do there...most of the lower years were free to go since it's already their last day of exams and we've finished our practices for the day. >_> On the downside, the yearbook people are really working hard right now. With graduation just around the next corner, we're trying to finish the things as soon as possible. With luck, we can give out the yearbook on said day of the graduation...

Now... just waiting for the files. XP"

I had lost count of the exact number of stores I went to, but it seemed as if I had practically searched <i>every <b>single</b></i> gift store that I knew of. The reason? I was trying to look for a special gift for someone special... *coughcoughblushblush* She's coming home for the holidays, and since I know that she'll be spending most of it with her family, I wanted to do something extra special for her -- which does NOT include the usual 'BearHugs' or even those 'Care Bears' my friends are giving to their respective others. No offense to those stuff toys or to my friends, and I'm quite sure that she herself will definitely find them cute... but the thing is, they're really just so overly used. >.<

Finally, after hours of searching, I settled on a personalized music CD and a lovely bouquet arrangement consisting of liliums and mums from my patron flower shop. I know, I know... You should not just 'settle' on anything that when it comes to your loved one, especially gifts -- but I really have no choice at the moment.

My friend had asked me this, just a little while before I left the campus. 

Then it hit me. Hard. The ACET is scheduled for tomorrow. And I have yet to review/go over a single thing since a few months ago! Nyuu!!! >_<

Arguably, this is just another hurdle in the lives of the many fourth year high school students nowadays. Though, the fact is, it is still pretty much troublesome for us now that everyone's trying to juggle all of the schoolwork and whatnot. Geez...somehow, I envy those people who AREN'T taking the test tomorrow. And yes, I'm only saying this because I'm one of those seniors who <i>really</i> don't like the idea of having to take the test tomorrow. >.<

But then, of course, if we don't take the exam, how are we supposed to qualify to get into our respective dream institutions? The universities can't possibly accept too much students... so we still end up taking their tests.

Prepared, or unprepared, I'll just try to do my best...and hope that it's good enough.

Wish me luck.

Because I'm very sure I will need all the luck that I can get. >_<"

"event","It's been raining all afternoon, and by the time I got home from school, I think it's best to say that I pretty much fell down to an almost dead heap the very moment I stepped out from the car. It was a good thing that someone brought me to my room since I really didn't think that I could have made it through all of those winding steps. >_<

So, yeah... I guess I'm supposed to be resting right now. But then again, sitting down in front of my monitor is my idea of 'rest'. XD Seriously though, this is one of the rare times that I've been able to surf the net this week. With all the things we have to do in school and whatnot, it is kinda hard finding time for myself.

Anyway, the practice for our musical presentation has been becoming more and more recurrent. Thankfully. We have less than one week to finalize everything, from the music to the dances. >.>

And that's not including the separate preparations we have to do for the school's Foundation Week. x.X

Gah.

At least I had a moment to scribble this bit down in between the practices. So, erm... yeah. /swt. Am copying it right off from the paper, so please bear with me. ^^;

<lj-cut text=""Scribbles"">
Title: Indoors (tentatively)
Series: Strawberry Panic!
Pairing: (?) Slight Amane/Hikari?
Disclaimer: Sto-Pani! is owned by its respective owners (Madhouse, et al...)


Amane never once failed to practice. Ever.

An ethereal blue painted the endless sky, and the pasty white clouds told nothing of the rains they shed the day before. The birds that sat on the tree by her room window were singing merrily, just as the sun crept to climb up the heavenly ladder.

It was still early; but the day was already proving to be a painstakingly ideal day for practice.

But, then again, there were exceptions to everything.

And today, Ootori Amane certainly won't be going to the horse ranch. Rather, she wouldn't be able to.

All because of some bad cold that she caught yesterday during her little rain-filled practice.

Amane sighed.



Normally, she wouldn't mind such an insignificant factor in her training. But the high fever and recurrent coughs prevented her from doing much of anything.

So, to stay in bed was the doctor's main order.

But she didn't like it one bit. 

Moreover, she hated it; she wouldn't be at the stables where Star Bright was, where the other members of the club prepared the horses, and where everyone else surely took turns to practice their gallops and rounds. 

She didn't blame them, of course, since it would be a shame if they didn't practice.

The Spica Prince just hated the fact that she wasn't there; and that meant she wasn't going to see Hikari.
 
And for that, to her, the day was a nightmare that would not simply end.



Hikari.

It was a wonder how she always seemed to brighten at the mere thought of the third grader.

The angelic being evoked strange, though not unwanted, feelings in her; something that she had never felt before -- an enigma that even Spica's Prince cannot coherently figure out.

Amane smiled slightly, her gaze turning to a certain scarf that was folded neatly atop her bedside table. The one that Hikari gave.

There meetings would be short and brief, but more often that not, heartrendingly sweet.

Crimson eyes closed for a moment, wondering briefly if she was there right now, at the ranch with all the other horse-enthusiasts. After all, the small girl never failed to show up to all of her practices... 

...well, mostly the ones that didn't involve the rainy weather.

But Amane was glad that the blonde didn't come yesterday; else she might die from worry as to what happened to the younger girl -- whether or not she got sick like she did.

But then, again, the Prince could always use that as an excuse to go visit her.

She smiled, but shook her head.

It was a crazy thought.

This is what happens when I re-watch an episode (specifically Strawberry Panic! 8) and I have this crazy inkling of going back to writing fics and the like. 

It has been a while since I last touched any of my unfinished fics (as if I could ever find them again, anyway)...

Just hope that this isn't <i>too</i> embarrassing for me. Aside from the occasional RP I join in different forums, I rarely write much of anything anymore.

So, yeah. It's only a drabble, though...just to get my feet wet again and such.

<lj-cut text=""Half-lucid Drabble"">
Title: Rainy Days (pending, to be revised anyway.) -_-

Hikari did not like rainy days.

She would rather open her eyes kissed by the golden pallid rays of sunlight, rather than the transient flash of a lightning strike. 

Preferred to wake up to birds singing a whimsical melody that haunted her soul, than to rolling thunder that invaded fear into her mind. 

And she certainly favored the comforting warmth of the afternoon sun, instead of the freezing and numbing rain soaking her wet.

Hikari always liked the clear blue better than the blackened skies, her unhindered view of a certain Spica prince practicing meticulously at the horse ranch than through a dense downpour of the heavy shower that would remind her of the distance she kept while watching. She knew perfectly well that Amane would still continue on with her daily routine with Star Bright, minding not whatever weather conditions there were. 

She hated that.

She was also not one to dream about being caught in the midst of rain storm while she was walking around the campus -- much less without an umbrella. That would mean she had nothing to shield herself with against the offending weather, lest she wanted to get sick; and she definitely did not want that.

Her heart would pound painfully against her chest, whenever the thought of catching a cold should form in her head. Not because she didn't like staying back in the dorm-room and missing her classes, but because of the fact that she wouldn't see Amane if she did so. And she believed Amane would not come visit her -- so there was no way that would happen, after all.

Over and over, she would repeat to herself the said reasons why she didn't like the rain. Why she simply didn't care for it. Why, in the plainest of thoughts possible, she was better off without it. And again and again, unbidden anxiety seeping into her heart, she could only come down to one thing...

Konohana Hikari <i>hated</i> rainy days.


</lj-cut>

And I should hit the hay. >.< 

Lack of sleep at night makes me inattentive in class. /swt"

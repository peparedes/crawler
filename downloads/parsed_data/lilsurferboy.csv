"event","<i>Describe a dream you had as a child that has stayed with you.

<small>My dreams were always simple even as a little boy. I have always loved to surf, it was something that kept me out of trouble so my mom approved of it. I used to have these big huge dreams that I'd become this super amazing pro surfer, make a lot of money and get my mom a nice house. Somewhere she could call her own with no worries of banks or landlords or anything. It'd be hers and no one could take it from her. She would have the right to remodel as she pleased, and she could decorate anyway she wanted. She could put nails or tacks in the walls to hand pictures if she desired. I still dream of that today though I've been close to my goal something always messes it up. Maybe this time I'll be lucky, third time is a charm right?</small>

If you could change one thing in history, what would it be and why?

<small>I think about the only thing I'd change would be blowing kaitlin off for Marissa. I knew Kaitlin liked me and Marissa had Ryan. I don't know why I was the way I was, or why I was so enthralled by Marissa. Maybe it's because she was the only other person besides Chilly that treated me with respect. She saw me for a person and not just a loser with a surfboard. I was too blind to see Kaitlin thought the same exact way for me. Too blind to see that it was Kaitlin who had been there for me those last few days. Too blind to see the looks she gave me and the soft smiles. I thought she was playing a game, that I was a conquest, and I was too blind to see I was wrong until it was almost too late.

I'd change the stupid way I acted, and the getting her to come with me because she had alcohol on hand. I'd change my stupid behavior and I wouldn't have climbed that cliff drunk off my ass. I wouldn't of had need to look at Ryan with hatred and contempt. I wouldn't have been a dumb ass and fell nearly killing myself. I would of been with Kaitlin sooner, and I would have the happiness I have now a lot sooner.</small>

"event","<i>My mom had it hard I know. What with having to raise a son on her own. I know it was a strain on her mentally, physically, and financially. It's why I wanted to be a surfer, why I wante to enter competitions. I wanted to use something I was good at to get money to help out my mom. To make sure she was set and happy. To return everything she had ever done for me back. I know I didn't have to but she's my mom. She sacrificed so much to raise a child on her own when she could have just given me up.


I'll always love and respect my mom for that. She is an amazing woman. I know I put her through hell with my little drinking stunt. When I was in the hospital in a comatose state after the fall. I remember hearing her cry, it broke my heart to know I was causing my mom this pain. All for stupid reasons, it was then my eyes opened. I realized I was infatuated with the idea of having something I know I never could have. That I did love someone, and her name was Kaitlin.



I'm back on the surf tour thanks to Kaitlin, and I've won my first big tournament. I've already spent most of the prize money. I bought mom a house for Mother's day, the look of happiness on her face made me smile. She made me and Kaitlin pick out a room that was ours. Seeing my mom happy was the best thing anyone could ever ask for.

"event","The only thing that is missing from my life right now that I can even remotely think of, is surfing. Though currently I'm slowly working on getting that back with Kaitlin's encouragement. She's suck an amazing girl and I love her for it. She's been prodding me trying to get me motivated. She's seen how I look at the waves with a wistful look in my eyes. She knows I miss it and wants me to have that joy back in my life. I'm lucky to have her. I will get back out there and reclaim whats missing in my life right now. To be free upon the waves letting the wind wove with me. Taming the ocean bending it to my will. The salt air filling my lungs and the rush of adrenaline as a wave crashes over me. I'll get it back and then my life will be complete once more.

Mocking? guess the best thing to say was this all happened before I ever met Marissa or Kaitlin. Me and my friends used to love mocking those rich kids who were just too good to go to public school. Who thought that since they were in private school it somehow made them better, even if they had known you. I hated them. I envied them. I remember one a boy he was kind of meek you could say me and my friends found him and circled him followed him as he yelled about how he'd tell dear old dad we were bothering him. I could remember yelling out in a mocking voice as if I was crying ""wah I'm going to go run and tell daddy! daddy will show you riff raff!"" it was a riot though I did kind of feel bad for the kid it wasn't his fault he was how he was, it was those stupid spoiling parents that caused it. When Marissa come to Newport Union I was all ready to tease and mock her, then I got to notice she wasn't stuck up. Marissa and then later Kaitlin changed my views on those with money. Showed me not all were the whiney little babies."

Overheard secret? easy the day Kaitlin and Marissa were talking I had come over for Kaitlin's surfing lesson and heard them talking. I know it was wrong of me but I stopped and stood there for a bit listening to them talk about me mostly. I knew Kaitlin liked me hell she made no secret about it I was just a blind idiot at the time and was all ga-ga over her sister Marissa. I felt i may have a chance when Marissa wasn't able to honestly answer Kaitlin or whether she liked me or not. I knew right then and there I had to find out.



It does bother me to this day I listened in on them talking privately I know it was wrong and I have told Kaitlin about it and apologized for being such a pig. SHe forgave me which makes me happy. 



Kaitlin makes me happy took me nearly dying to find that out."

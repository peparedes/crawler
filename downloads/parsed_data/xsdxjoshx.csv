plus being emo doesnt mean u always complain about things. it just means that you are  emotional. you express ur emotions in different ways whether through writing or physically in ur out ward actions but u know what there is nothing wrong with that.... i mean look at the breakfast club they were all emo  it just never came out....

u and the rest of us let our emotions out a lil more then most... 

<3 to you kellyelly and the res of my good friends out there you are all amazing.

Other than that (and the fact that I can't listen to anything but 50 or Em - lol), life is good. Working a lot...a lot actually, but that's a good thing cause I'm broke and I need the money!  Got bills to pay, money to save, a car to buy, and school's about to start in less than a month!  Plus I gotta get all that COlorguard stuff squared away!  Anyhoo, it sucks cause we're staying open later starting on Wed....guess who gets to close that night....yay!  (kiddin - I'm never excited about that one.) I had to close last night too...that was...interesting to say the least...long story - and not worth the time.

So yeah...headin' over to MySpace...I will try and keep this updated, but nonetheless check out MySpace first...Love you all!

"event","Hey!  Guess who's back!  Well, I have to admit that I have neglected this good ol thing cause I've gotten slightly hooked on MySpace...yeah - didn't think it would happen but it did!  So if you really wanna know what's going on with the Kissy, you'll have to catch up with that.  But other than that I will try and keep you livejournal people posted on the whereabouts of me and all.

Life hasn't been extremely bad...interesting nonetheless, but not too bad.  The Bonkey Mobile is on it's last thread, so I'm selling it (I really don't know the details about it cause actually my parents are selling it, but whatever).  I'm sad about it, but at least i know that whatever money we make goes to a down payment on a new car.  I'm kinda looking at a Celica...found one that i like to that I could probably afford...it's blue...and nice!  But I dunno...just an idea too...

What else is there...love life...confusing as ever!  I think the summer always brings that out...but yeah...was with someone not too long ago, but that didn't work out...not really sure why and all, but it didn't work out...which was sad, but what can a girl do?  Boys are going to have to learn their lesson one way or another...he'll regret it though...lol

Now, there's a couple - take that back - a few people that have kinda come outta no where in the whole love scene.  I feel like I should be on the dating game!  That would be kinda funny!  But yeah, I know who I want to be with - like seriously want to be with - no fling or just hook up or some stupid shit like I've been doing this entire year - but someone I want to be with and see what really happens with it...one problem though...that gawd awful word - DISTANCE!  He doesn't live here...in fact...he doesn't live in Cali either...how much does that suck!  But who knows...We're talking about savin' up money to get one of us to the other to see eachother...so who knows...maybe it'll happen...

Well, yeah, that's pretty much the deal...hopefully you all see that I wrote this...that would suck if no one noticed!  lol

"event","Ok, here's a completely theoretical topic.  And yes, it was influnenced by ""my everything"" and I feel compelled to speak my mind.  Here it goes...

Depression has met my doors once before. Being hit by a father I thought loved me, losing my virginity to a man who I loved but did not return the feelings and left me for another, to know that I had no family other than that of my sister's, these items - these entities in my life - drove me to a place where I wish to never be brought open again.  To want to die with no care in the world is something no person should endure.  But I did.  And look at me now.

Depression is a time - a moment in time that lasts years in the endureers eyes.  Nothing but the frozen hands of time exist - no person, place or thing matters - only your depression.  Those cascading walls surround everything - theres no turning back from that grave hole.  But here's the thing - that grave - that fearing time of no supposive return - is all done by the hands - and only done by the hands of one person.  The depressed one.  No one in this world, no matter what the depressed person thinks, is responsible.  I learned this now as I look back on my life then.  I was to blame.  Yes, I see how others affected me to choose that path, but I know that the only person to blame for it all was my reflection in the mirror.  No one else stuck 40 pills down my throat and made myself swallow nail polish remover.  No one did that but me.  I could have died - all at my own hands.  I thank every God in the whole universe that I can sit here today, typing with my own fingers, telling my own story, rather than someone else speaking it for me.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is this:  The world is not fair, people will hate you, you will fail, and you may feel sad, but that is life.  Life has it's pleasures as well:  you will find love, you will achieve, you will be happy.  All of these things are determined by the individual - and no one else.  So I challenge all who choose to set their eyes to this:  Look at what you have, and realize that that right there is so much.  You have life for one...something that you couldn't have if you choose.  I know for a fact that such things should not be taken for granted.  I did - please don't learn that on your own.  Learn from my mistakes.  I'm fufilled in life thinking that maybe one person - just one person - will benefit from what I am saying...So, look on the brighter side - there always is one.

"event","Well, if you can't see how things went from this, I don't know what to tell you - I'm a big poetry person, and everything I wrote today.  Things have gone back to the way they were...

*No where to run
In this horrid hell
No reason to love
There lies no ending bell.
The world is against
Everything with joy
To strike my heart broken
Like some stupid toy.
What shall I do
Now that it all is over?
Find the nearest hiding spot
And forever take cover.

*Bound in chains I cannot break,
I wear this mask
For everyone else's sake.
Everyone thinks they know this girl
All they know is nothing
Compared to what would undoubtedly make them hurl.
Everyone, I know, has their hurt
but none can even fathom
The crypt I live in, smothered it dirt.

I give my all to those around
to only recieve nothing
For some reason, such evil is bound.
All I do is care and love
So why must it be
That everyone must upon me push and shove?
Love will never seep to me
For I am the bearer
Of love never returned to thee.

This tale has reached a cliff
I seek for answers
Of whether to move forward and shift.
I thought these feelings were forever dead
Upon the darkness of six feet
But now the truth of sorrow lead.
My heart shattered from being given up
I see no point
In making everyone else's hearts gallop.

Now I lay upon this mat
Where I search for the grasp
Of a hand that surely can't.
I try to keep the mask always on
But forevermore
The pain will not be gone.
Now there is no other choice
Infinitely depression will reign
Through my shattered voice.
Everyone thinks the outspoken I am
But no one sees
The woman from them I ban.
No one knows who this is
For they close their eyes
To strike away from slitting their wrists.
I am the razor haunting them all
No wonder joy or happiness
Will never - EVER - be my call.

*People are oblivious
To everything around them.
I could die today
and no one would even care.
And those same people
say this is not truth
But furthermore,
They have not walked in my shoes.
Try - for once - to be an outsider
And look upon the world
Not through your eyes
But through anothers.
They always think
Being sick lies in a cold
Well, I am living example
Of such being lies told.
I try to fit in
And fill into their mold
But how can I
When sorrow is my call?
There is no way
To just snap and forget.
Perfect the world will never be
So such simplicity doesn't exist.
Look at them all
They sit there pompously
They don't even view
The raging death I see.
I truly wonder what they would say
If today my life
By the hands of me
Came to see it's whistful end...
I wish I never pondered such things
But forevermore
My mind will not receed
And always carry that ""what if"" to my grave.

If there had been a gun in my hand today, ecspecially in the morning, I would've used it.  I feel like I did, and I never thought that was possible to return.  The only thing - the only thing - that stopped me from doing anything was Tyler.  Funny how everyone told me he was shit.  When I needed anyone the most, guess who was there...yeah, Tyler.  No one - and I mean no one - gave two shits.  Everyone was focused on me not fucking up their lives.  As long as that wasn't happening, everything was fine.  I hate people - I'm so sick of this world.  No one cares because they choose to.  Why does everyone think it's ok to say ""I'm here for you"" and not be there?  It's not the same...I can't believe it's all come back.  Life honestly doesn't matter to much to me anymore. Because there lies no one for me.  No one."

"event","Well, I'm not really sure what to say right now - I just know that I needed to get some stuff off my chest and this seemed to be the best way to do it.  I dunno, I try really hard to keep my hopes high because I know that there are so many around me who can't. And I wanna be there for all of them and help them cope with whatever is haunting them, but it's oh so hard to keep my own up.  I try so hard - so hard - to keep going and to keep letting life proceed on with what it has in store for me, but I don't know anymore.  I'm so tired - so tired - from trying to keep everyone else happy and going.  I love being there, but now it's starting to wear on me.  And it's not their issues or being there for them - it's wearing on me that nothing seems to be working when I try to work out my own problems.  All I do is show everyone that I'm there and that i care, and it all seems to get slammed in my face.  I tell someone how i feel, and i scare the shit outta them.  I try to be there, and they take it as invading or that I'm trying to ruin their lives.  i don't understand what I'm doing wrong, or where i took a wrong turn.  And I'm not sure how much I can take of this.  I feel myself slowly gettin back to the person that i was - that depressed son of a bitch that could not find any reason to smile or be happy.  And that scares me so much - so much - because I cannot go back to that.  I feel like I am fighting it all off with all these demons pulling me in.  I don't know what to do anymore.  When am I gonna get someone to help me when I need help, or someone to care about me?  It just gets to me, because all I do is be there for everyone else.  But I guess that's how the world works, and there's nothing I can do about it.  No one can find a way to love me, because there is always someone else taking Championship, while I sit here with 1st place (you guard people will understand that one.)

Things are actually so much better.  everyone is accepting this whole thing now, which is super!  I'm not gonna lie, I am so happy.  I can't wait to get to Band now because I know I'll see Lauren.  I have to admit though too - It scares me.  I think I could fall in love.  I'm not saying that I have - I haven't gotten ""hit by lightning"" yet, but i realized it at the end of lunch.  I never thought I could get these butterfly feelings again - ecspecially after Tyler.  and since everything started, they haven't gone away.  at all.  everyday is super because of her.  I love every minute of it.  and that scares me.  What if I do love her?  What would she think? And now I just realized that she'll probably be reading this (if so - Hi how r u?), but I don't care.  I hope I don't scare her - but I'm not gonna lie - things have been moving so fast.  and it's not necessarily a bad thing either.  I love it.  And I think I might be.  I don't know.  I don't want to ruin things.  I love how it all is - everything.  I am so damn happy it's not even funny.  I - oh...my...gawd...omg.......................................................................................................................  oh my gawd - I think it just hit me.  I feel like I just got hit by lightning - no joke here or anything.  I was going to say it, and I realized it cause well, I think about what I say before i typr it in.  but I know what I was going to say, and it wasn't like it normally was when I say that to everyone I care about....omg....this is big...crap - I should just delete all of this and speak about it out loud, but I'm stupid and am not going to do that.  Omg....what the hell? I knew it! It is so like getting hit by lightning! Wow...never thought I could or would ever feel like that again.

Well, new subject so my mind can calm down a little bit.  tyler and I aren't even talking anymore.  he hurt me a lot with some of the things he said to me yesterday, and i told him I was done.  he's  - well, I think this will explain what I think:

Selfish in stars
He cannot reach
I only hope his bars
will soon present their lesson to teach.
All I did was love and cared
Hold is hand
When no one else dared
To help him band.
Where his heart travels now
I will never know
For the actor took his bow
From the reality of his show.
A one-man act I grew to love
Now closes it's doors
He chose the clouds above
With their hollow cores.
Where has he gone to so wretchedly
To leave truth behind
To no confrontingly
See the real truth defined.
Away he goes on this fatal path
The curtain will close
He will never see the math
Because forevermore, defeat he now has chose.

Yeah  wrote that during 4th period today.  that pretty much sums it up.  

Well, better go - bell will ring in a little bit, have to get my stuff together, and go get ready for practice - yay!  Kinda not excited cause of the fact that we are watching the show - which I sucked ass at, so yeah...ok, still all ""whoa"" about the uh ""lightning"" as we will call it.  HOLLA!!!

Well, school is going.  Not too much going on there...it's going I guess.

Winterguard...awww, where to begin.  Well, Regionals were this weekend.  It was a $300 fee to get in!  Yeah, get to Union City with my dad, brother, and Ashlie Friday night.  Stayed in a hotel next door to LaShona.  Uhhhhh...got to the school the next morning to find that Robby didn't show.  Oh wow - never seen the guard that ready to rumble!  Performed...flags had a good show...weapons sucked ass...pissed me off cause Tomas was all in my face like 2 minutes before we went on.  and I let it get to me bad so I had a crappy show...I was hella pissed with everything going on, and then called anthony.  We broke it off.  I told him that I was interested in someone else...who happens to be a girl.  Yeah, killed his ego a little bit I think...j/k.  So yeah, things were crazy today cause Lauren and I told Dana and Corey...that was hell.  It went way worse than I thought it would be.  I had told so many ppl, and they still stuck by me...but I felt like they were angry at me.  It wasn't good...made me really angry myself.  For once, Tyler was right - if they're your friends then they'll be there for me, but if not, then I guess they weren't friends to begin with.  Honestly, I think it's stupid.  I mean, if you don't swing that way and all, good for you, whatever, I don't care.  If you do, good for you, whatever, I don't care.  I feel like it's being made out into a bigger deal than it is...that was hella hard to deal with today...but Dana and Lauren and I talked afterschool.  I think Dana is trying to be okay with it...I don't know, I just felt like it was still hella weird for her...but at least I know that she's there and all you know?  Uhhh...OMG - V day was super!  Lauren wrote me a poem!  It was the sweetest thing in the world.  And she got me a chocolate rose!  yay!  I got her this cute little card that i wrote some stuff in and this stuffed lion that had a heart that said ""be my valentine""  It was super.  It was so cute - at the end of her poem, it said to give her a kiss. Well, the bell rang and there were so many ppl around, so it didn't happen...damn it...lol!  Well, things are super now.  I'm happy...it's cool...better go - getting tired - I had like no sleep last night!

Well, on the outside, things have been super.  School has been school - it's been going and everything.  I'm starting to lose focus in Physics again - it is that damn boring and stupid.  But I guess that's just something that I'm going to have to work on, you know?  Got my box paper back.  That was weird to look at again.  Ecspecially with the CD is Me project and all...I was so happy to know that Kevin loved it too.  That was cool.  I feel like nobody cares about the stuff I write, which in turn hurts me because I care about it so much.  It's nice when someone cares.

Winterguard is insane!  I have been on a complete high about it all since Wednesday's practice.  I am excited for tomorrow so much!  I just have to get through today!  I have to work at my stupid job - ugh...oh well, I am looking for a new job right now becasue I am getting no hours there.  I need more, and I'm going to find it somewhere else.  

Things this week have been crazy with Anthony.  I would get into it, but I don't feel like it.  So I'll leave it like this:  I really care about him.  He gives me those stupid little butterflys in my stomach.  I haven't felt that in a long time.  It's cool.  so yeah...<blushing right now - in the ears, that is!>

Hmmm, what else is there...On the inside and everything, I feel so stressed out.  I feel like there is so much I have to do, and I don't know where to start and all.  Like yesterday when I got home from work, I flipped out on my parents cause I was so stressed.  I felt really bad cause they didn't deserve that and all, but it just got to be too much.  I don't know...I just feel this way.  I'm okay and all, but it gets to be too much at times.

Well, I better go!  Oh, here's a fun fact for the day!  Shelly's birthday is today!  Well, I have to go and take a shower and get ready for work!  I'm there from 2 - 7.  Yay...it's gonna be super duper fun!  Notice the sarcasm...

"event","Hola fellow people and things!  Yeah, just a little hyper right now and all.  Things have been kinda shitty the past couple of days and all, except for today - it was awesome!  I will get there!

WINTERGUARD IS INCREDIBLE!!!!  THE SHOW IS AMAZING, I'M SO EXCITED FOR THE RUN THROUGH THIS SUNDAY - IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME!!  DANA AND I HAVE THIS AWESOME TOSS THINGY THAT IS AWESOME AND EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, yesterday, I spent the entire day working on my CD for West - it's amazing!  The title so far is ""8 Months and a Life Learned.""  Got a nice ring to it - I'm a little scared of it being so public, but I know that my excitement will overcome that.  I know I am going to step on people's toes by what is being said, but that's my life - besides, it's me - what the hell do you expect????

School is going good - didn't focus very well in Physics today - it was boring as hell!  But WEST is cool - I think I'm gonna switch outta the periods I have into the other ones - figured it could be fun!  

LaShona and I haven't really been able to communicate much cause we're both so busy and all, so we have this notebook that we pass back and forth.  It has helped me so much.  Like yesterday, I was so sown in the dumps about everyone and their shit, and she wrote me this poem that completely made me look at it all differently and reminded me to look on the brighter side.  It was awesome!  So yeah, incredible!

Uhhh, Band sucks - Concerto for Crappo or whatever the fuck it is -  I hate it.  BORING!!!   But it's entertaining with Dana there - what would I do without her?? Band would be hell, I'll tell you that much though!

Uhhh, went to lunch with Nick today...that was fun actually...we might go see a movie this weekend...which would be cool...ok - would that be a date?  I don't know, guys confuse me so much - awwwww!

Well, here's Karma at it's best - So had a good talk with LaShona about Anthony and guys in general.  And I've been so afraid to date again cause I am so scared that every guy is Tyler.  (By the way, haven't talked to him too much - he's getting his just desserts from 17 units cause he flunked the first semester - probably shouldn't tell him that Tim knows about everything - and I mean everything - that happened over Winter break....hmmmm...)  But I realized that I need to put that and leave that in the past cause that where it is.  So, I decide that I'm gonna ask out Anthony again on Monday...........only to find out he now has a girlfriend!  Yeah...thank god I forgot!  But it was funny - I told him that today.  I figured it doesn't matter either way if something was said or not, so might as well say it, you know?  Yeah - it was pretty funny...I'll leave it at that!

Well, that's about it - Life's good, and I'm finally starting to love it and all - so yeah...Later ppl - oh by the way, Erin - so glad you were at practice - whatcha think?

Well, it's been a long time since I've been on here - i was going to drop this entirely actually, but seeing that i don't have a 6th period and the library was open, I figured I would see what was up.

I don't understand how one thing can become great and leave something to shit.  That is how it has been for me.  And I don't get it - so I'll start with the good:

Ashlie (in case you don't know who she is, girly from Band and Winterguard and I have become really super duper good friends.  She's the least dramatic out of anyone I know, and always seems to know how to make me smile.  It's awesome!

Jeremy and I are actually talking again, which is incredible beyond belif. He has been one of my best friends for most of high school, and I have missed him so much this year, so I'm suppsed to give him a call tomorrow or something.  

Tyler and I are talking again.  I don't know if that's good or bad, seeing that we got into another arguement a little bit ago, but whatever - the cool thing about it is that I do not feel depended on him anymore.  I don't know if that makes sense or not, but yeah.

LaShona and I are awesome right now.  she's one of my best friends, and I love her to death.  I thought I had lost her last year, but I didn't thank god!  She's awesome - don't know how else to put it.

WINTERGUARD COMPETITIONS ARE COMING UP!!!!!!!!!!!  AWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!  I am so excited!  I am scared though - ppl keep forgetting drill spots and tosses and stuff are still shitty, but I have hope - I just don't want ne one to drop!  That's the worst!  I am so excited though!

Alright, here's the bad:

School is getting outta hand again.  I need to get serious about it and get my shit together.

My life is hectic - I'm at work, or practice, or school, and it's all so much.

My friends are shit right now.  Not them particularly, but the whole subject matter of it.  I don't know what else to do anymore.  I am so sick of all this drama.  Somebody always thinks I'm mad or pissed - the finger's always on me, and I'm sick of it.  It's driving me crazy - it's gotten to the point where I feel like driving away from it all.  The minute things with my family get great, they go to shit.  I don't know.

I'm not holding a grudge - but I'm not gonna lie to myself.  I don't think I can ever forgive her for what she said.  I'm easy?  I came to her in full fear of knowing what I was about to say was something that i myslef was ashamed of.  To get stabbed in the back, and then in front by finding out, I will never forget it.  It was horrible.  And to tell her that was how I felt and have it not mean anything - Things will never be the same again.  Like I said that day, if she thinks I'm easy, than screw her on that.  I'm done.

Tyler and I are talking again...I'll leave it at that.

You know, I started this year thinking that it was going to be CCDCL all the way - it's not - I'll be the first to finally admit it.  And it never will be.  Lauren you're right, we keep talking, but no one is truly being honest.  And I don't know what else to do anymore.  I am not here to please everyone and their needs.  But I guess I'm the fuck up of the group, and end up getting the shit pilled on me.  You can all think what you want, but that's through my eyes - not yours.  And I know saying this right now is a waste of breath - the hands of time will take it all into a wasted moment, and will soon be forgotten.  I'm sick of trying to fix everything.  It wears me down, and already I know that I am not a strong person - can we take this summer into account?  I am tyring to get away from those feelings of not mattering, and not wanting to live anymore.  And i can't go back - I won't.  So if people are going to drag me down with their pissed off feelings and dumping all our friendship problems on me, then I guess I'll have to look at it all from the rear view mirror, and realize that there are not 5 letters anymore, but rather coupling every once in awhile, and a C.

Well, life is pretty damn good actually - I haven't been able to honestly say that from the heart in a long time!  Things have had their weird spots though...let's see - of course Tyler's involved in that subject - LOL!  I finally told him what needed to be said - that I'm over him.  What was his response?  ""Maybe we shouldn't talk anymore."" (probably cause he know's I'm not gonna be his second string anymore!)  Well, it's Saturday now, and I've talked to him about, oh, everyday now...yeah - the F***er is a retard - and undecisive.  Funny thing is, he probably thinks that I'm gonna be there for him if he drops me.  I flat out told him yesterday that if he does that he shouldn't expect anything - I'm gone.  Simple as that!

Let's see...things other than that couldn't be better!  Anthony and I are dating again I guess...it's different though.  I don't know, I'm not saying that he's not attractive, but I like him so much more for the person that he is.  Like, he genuinely cares about me as a friend and a person.  And that's something I need right now (seeing that I never got that from a certain f***er!)  And it couldn't be better right now!  He's awesome - I love it!

School is actually not that bad though.  I'm really trying to focus this semester - ecspecially in Physics!  WEST is awesome - except for the whole 2 hour government class!

Friends are good - they still feel a little weird.  A lot of the time, I feel like I'm gonna lose Sheep and Norm.  I don't know - they seem to like to spend more time with Flash a lot of the time - and i guess that scares me, ecspecially with graduation right around the corner!  Ecspecially with Sheep -  I don't want to lose her at all.  I don't think she even knows how much I love her to death!  And I'm not saying it's not like that with Norm and Flash - but I think they know it more than Sheep cause I spend a lot more time with them and all...well, in the end, I hope everything will work out for the better!

Better go - Love you all bunches!

Savage

PS - Erin: it was awesome to see you in Band!  I only wish I could've seen you and talked to you more!  Oh - and on the 30th of this month we (that being Winterguard) is having our showcase performance at the Gym at school at 8 - we'll perform twice I think - you have to come!  :-)"

School started today - which was actually one of the best days ever.  Shelly made this awesome breakfest - waffles! - so that really woke me up.  Classes weren't too bad - don't have a 5th period though - gotta get that changed! Spent 5th period gettin some rings for my cell - hella cool and all!  Uhhh, things with Anthony are goin again...we're dating and all I guess, but I told him I wanted to take things slow and all - I need that now.  Things with Tyler and I are no more - we are not friends anymore either.  After I told him that I was over him, he said that it would be best if we didn't talk because he was sick of fighting with his gf.  I won't deny it - I was hurt, and I wanted to call and change his mind. Instead, I talked to my dad and he said something really smart: if he really cared bout me as a friend or more or whatever, then he wouldn't let others get in the way.  Well, we all know now what's going on, and I think we know the answer to that one when it comes to him...

Things with my family are super.  It couldn't be better. Marcus is doing a lot better - he's a little bummed about not having video games anymore and all, but he's doing good!

Winterguard is amazing right now - I think I have a solo and I wanna know really bad - I love the show - and everyone on the team - and i want to know if I have a solo really bad - had practice today - was hella good - loved the Goodies dance and doing that again.  The parent meeting went good - can't wait for first competition - and we have a performance in 3 WEEKs from last Sunday!  YAY!!

That's about it - love you all!

"event","Well, things are different right now.  A lot has happened that I think will kinda surprise a lot of you all.  So, let me start from the beginning...

New Year's Eve was not what I expected it to be.  I spent the morning with Tyler, where we sat around and watched Napoleon Dynamite.  It was weird - things felt like they used to, but things also took another turn for the worse.  At about 2:30 that afternoon, I was told to call my Grandma Susie. She was making no sense to me whatsoever because she was in complete hysterics.  I ended up getting out this much: Marcus had had 3 more seizures and was rushed to the ER.  He was at the same buddy's house, and they didn't know what was going on.  I immediately called my other grandma who filled me in about it all. (Through all of this I wouldn't let Tyler leave cause I was about ready to break something...he helped, even though things were weird...) I called my dad in the ER and told him that I would be on my way.  I met him in there, where my brother was cruched up in a stretcher and really out of it.  That is the second time I have seen him like that - I hope none of you ever have to experiance that with a loved one.  I felt so helpless, and already it was weird because it was just my dad and I (I later found out that Shelly had Mason at home because he was recently at the hospital with a bad case of bronchitus - he's doing better though). My dad and I had the longest talk - it lasted about 3 hours during which Marcus was admitted to the hospital in room 418.  In the end of it all, I decided to spend New Year's with Shelly and Mason.  Gosh you guys, Mason is so big!  He was running around the hospital room like crazy.  Shelly and I went home, up Hwy 32 (which I might add scared the shit out of me - I hadn't been up there since, well, you know...) to the house.  It was snowing too - that was pretty cool.  Well, walking into the house gave me a weird feeling like I belonged, but I was still a guest.  Shelly and I had a really long talk, where we ended up going to bed at around 1.  I stayed up till about 2 watching tv, then I shut it off.  I layed there, and for the first time in awhile, I talked to God.  I asked Him to help me with what was going on, to give me and my family and my brother strength to get through this, and to guide me on what to do.  I have been at such a crossroads for a long long time, not knowing what to do with everything.  And I fell asleep with that.  

I woke up this morning to find out that my brother was coming home. We went and picked him and my Dad up, and came back.  I knew that then I had the chance to go back to my other home, but something in my told me not to.  I spent the day with my brother watching Napoleon Dynamite (it's that damn good!).  My dad came to me later and asked me what I wanted to do.  I thought about it, knowing that either way would be difficult, and i made a decision: I wanted to come home.  To make a long story short, I ended up calling Dana and Kelly and telling them my decision, going to Chico and to their house, where Dana and I packed up everything, had a hard goodbye (which I told her would never be goodbye) and i came back here.  I am at home now with my family.

I made this choice for a lot of reasons.  My family needs me now more than ever - things with my brother and his seizures are a very serious long-term thing now, and we have to keep a close eye on him for awhile.  Plus, my parents and I had a long talk about everything that had happened, and I finally heard the things I needed to hear so badly - that everything that happened was because of all of us, and things needed to be better.  But above all, i heard something that I needed to hear so much: that they never stopped loving me, and they love me still.  So, I prayed to God a lot about all of it, and I really need to suck it all up.  I love the Carpers for everything that they have done for me and I will never not love them for it all, but I have a family that I need to be with.  I have needed them I think since I left, and now things are really - and I mean truly really - better now.  I think that time away gave us a harsh realization of what is really important. 

So, I hope you all will notice in my info that the e-mail and AIM have changed.  I just want to leave you with knowing that everything is going to be alright.  I am going to enter into some counceling on my own choice - I think I've needed it for a really long time.  So, there it is - the big news. What a way to start off 2005.

Luv, Chrissy"

Not really doing much right now and all, so I figured I'd leave you all with something different.  Ever since I have been living here and all, I really got into writing and stuff instead of the normal journal thingy <wait - still doing that...isn't that what this is?>.  So, here's a couple of poems I've written.  One that some may have heard, others that no one has.  I'd like to know what you guys think about them and all - and if you have any questions about them, let me know!  So, hope you enjoy!

*LIES*

I hate being lied to.
I hate using the word hate to define such things.
What was ever the point?
The truth be told,
Lives would proceed,
Hearts would beat, never being broken.
How can someone sit there,
Upon some invisible throne,
And seep words of deception and trickery
That need not exist in the first place?
It always deals with the least significant issues...
All he had to say was a simple answer to a petty question
And my fire would not be raging with antoagonizing irritation.
I have spent so much of my time on faithless people and occasions.
Why do I continue to bask in a sun that will only Burn me?
I have made decisions - made choices - that were based on his kingly ways
Of power within deception,
And not being able to find such other units.
In this kingdom reigns your royal highness,
Loving life with his queen,
Who perches upon his side, holding no significance other than that of his queen.
What a relationship - a life - to live,
Where your key orle is to better the appearance of another and only that.
I hold sorrow for her and her naivety.
I hope one day she unlocks her pretty blue eyes and looks the hell around
To realize that the kingdom sh once loved is no more,
And her king nothing but a greedy digger out for the sole purpose of one person.
How her heart will depart this life from learning that one person is not her.
I fear the day - for her sake.
She does not deserve to live within deception she can not see.
She does not deserve to always wonder what else his eager hands are on.
I am not even familiar to her or her life,
And feel such truths to really reign through that kingdom.
It is distressing to hear that everyone else within the land
Sees the truth - except for her.
I only wish upon countless stars that I could give her my eyes.
Give her the glimpse she can not grasp.
No one should be at the hands of another merely for the objective of his domination.
I now see such truths.
I have left that kingdom to experiance and build my own.
I have finally open my eyes and saw his pounding grasp that once stole my life away.
No more shall this life live on his words and broken promises.
No more will my days be fully centered on making his sun come out again,
Painting a smile on his face while I sit under this gloomy cloud.
I deserve that cloud to vanish and find another place to call home.
His head, promptly iced iwth a crown,
Would be a perfect residence...
I have done no wrong - he is worthy of such a nuisance.
Why do these thoughts hold true?
There is one thing that breaks the line between him and I:
I don't break promises,
And I do not lie.

<I wrote that about this girl I only know from someone else, and from what was going on through my eyes and my experiances with the one who ""introduced"" her to me...so yeah...>

*UNTITLED*

I sit here holding my own hand
Because there lies no one else to take my place.
I told you all before,
I am no builder to any and every face.
Pouring out my heart
Only reaches so far.
Crying out rivers
Only raises the bar.
I can not live on such a thread,
Dangling upon forgotten joys,
Loathing for a solution,
Forgetting all the usful childhood toys.
Saved and sin
Hold the key
To what lies in front,
And what will always be.
Lying upon a broken heart
And breathing a wishful star,
I pray for true self worth
Even with the horror that are.

<Yeah...I was a little depressed when I thought of this one...the first line came that one night with the ""Late Night Pain"" entry>

*WITHIN THIS BATTLE*

Within this battle,
I have fought.
I have lived everyday breathing every tired strive,
Every last moment of hope.
Within this battle,
I have cried.
I have mounded hills with my rivers,
And grasped admiration of joy.
Within this battle,
I have been happy.
I have driven smiles upon others,
Creating a sun to rise once more.
Yet, within this battle,
Withing every little lesson,
I have learned.
I have learned to live with pain recognized, but never lead.
With strength buried only once, but now found,
I have learned.
All, within this battle.

*I PROMISE*

Promise, and you shall never regret.
There lies no point in a swear.
A promise, sewn tight with devotion,
Is all one heart shall need.

I hate those who disregard these beauties,
These priceless ties of truth.
I hate even more so
Those made in lies.

With such a promise,
Fear will, and has followed.
My heart loathes the days of bliss
Where your arm held me so close.

My mind, promising to remember,
Brings me back to that night.
I can't help but wonder and marvel
The joy painted across my face.

Suddenly those walls shrink
And the reality kicks in.
That night was,
and is not the present.

Yet, within these recollections,
My promise rings choirs
Of preaching awareness,
And as a lighting reminder.

For sakes of both you and I,
I devote back to what was,
And send once more
My promise to you:

I will always be there
Through think and thin
Becasue I love you,
And because I promise this, to you.

<I wrote that one last night...I was having a hard time dealing with a promise I made to someone dear to my heart, and was really, shall we say, ""tempted"".  So I had to really get it all out and get my mind back on the right track...>

Hope you all like!  Sorry it's long!  <aren't all my entries though?>

Luv, Rugby!!!!"

Well, let's see...there's a lot on my mind right now and all, so I'm not really sure where to start...

Well, to much of anyone's surprise, Tyler hasn't really looked at this...and I guess that's his loss and all.  Him and I have been such a weird thing lately...it's been crazy these past couple of weeks and all.  But when everything was finally said and done, we are just friends.  Not gonna lie, it sucks to have things change and all, but I understand - which is the different part now.  I mean, before when we would be pulling shit like this, it would always end in heartbreak for me.  But that wasn't the case this time around.  It was really different and weird.  For once, I wasn't the one questioning everything and all - it was him thinking that we couldn't pull off the whole ""just friends"" thing.  I had to reassure him...that was different...I'm not used to doing that...but now things are what they are...Yeah, things didn't go exactly how I wanted them to, but it's okay now.  Life isn't completely fair at times, and I can't predict the future and all...who knows what could happen, you know?  All I really cared about through everything with him was that he always knew that I was there for him - through thick and thin - and that he knew that I loved him to death.  So, as long as that's clear, and he's happy and all, then everything is good.

Yeah, just reading over that kinda freaks me out - in a good way.  The past couple of days have really changed things around.  Don't really want to get into the nitty-gritty details and all, but I've finally been able to I guess forgive myself.  I have been so hard on myself for everything going on everywhere, and it has driven me crazy!  But I can finally look myself in the mirror and not be completely disgusted and all.  And I have faith in my problems and the things that haunt me becoming better.  This whole thing with Tyler is what kinda triggered it.  When I would normally be completely teary-eyed and broken, I held my ground in realizing that there was a difference from then and now: now, it doesn't hurt.  That's a HUGE thing for me to say...I don't think anyone can understand that.  It's crazy...but completely awesome too!

Well, with one more semester and college ringing the dorr bell, I'll admit it - I'm SCARED.  Already, I look at everything that has gone on this semester - this Winter vacation at that fact - and so much has gone on...It's insane to even comprehend.  I am not the same person whatsoever...I really don't think so.  And I really don't know if that's a good or bad thing either...don't really like to look at it that way, you know?  I'm really scared as to what this next semester will bring and all...what boy's gonna enter my life now (you all know I have been having my share of boy issues and all - there's probably more coming my way later too!)?  What about school?  And friends?  Who am I gonna lose?  Who am I gonna get closer to?  I really can't answer such questions and all, but I can wonder about it...so here it is - my prediction...duh duh DUH!!!!  LOL!  I really think that the TC episode isn't over yet, I think I might get closer to a certain browny, school will be good, West will be incredible, and Winterguard will be the be the proudest moments I will ever experiance.  Yeah - that's my prediction...

I wasn't going to tell everyone the things i got for x-mas, but after looking at everyone elses lists too and all, figured I might as well....drum roll please...

* PINK PHONE!!!!!
* PINK slippers!
* PINK toe socks!
* Candy and shit
* About 150 in cash ( 50 of it I still haven't gotten though....my bro...grrrr)
* 50 to (yes) the Gap
* 30 to Tower
* FRUIT LOOPS PJ'S!!!  (How fuckin awesome is that?????)
* Bath stuff
* Chico State Sweatshirt
* A necklace that Dana's Grandpa gave to me (so pretty!!!!)
* Notebook and Quote Book
* Uhhh....

If I think of more, I'll add it, but right now my brains a little fried...so, on with the adventures of Christmas day!

Woke up early cause my Uncle picked me up and we headed to Quincy (after ""Santa"" came and all and Kelly and Roger made me breakfest!).  My grandma was all excited and stuff to see me - she of course had a shit load of food (DEAR LORD does that woman cook!)  Oh - it was so fuckin hilarious!  My Uncle bought Mike's Hard Cranberry Lemonade, and my grandma decided to drink one (she even handed me one....yeah...my uncle caught that!)...then she picked up another...and another...and a little bit later, you could tell she had had too many...it was funny - that's like the second time ever that my grandma has gotten tipsy...funny shit right there!  Well, my Uncle and I were going to spend the night, but we found out that a huge snow storm was gonna come in that night, and a Honda Accord was no match for that, so we had to leave that night.  It was awesome - I GOT TO DRIVE HOME!!!  (once we hit Butte, that is..)  It was so much fun - I miss driving!  So yeah, got home, got my stuff all situated, and called Tyler ( he was going to come up with me to Quincy cause he was gonna be by himself on Christmas, but then he couldn't cause he still had to be home when I left or something like that - I dunno...).  Then I went to bed, to get up this morning to go and get ready for work (Kelly made me breakfest - that was cool too!)  Had to work from 11 to 5 (which wasn't too bad - only wish I could've worked with Chris more...we were gonna talk, but we only got an hour before I was off...we're supposed to do something tomorrow!).  Then Roger picked me up (after hitting the drive thru) and then we came home, ate Taco Bell, and then I went into my room and gave Tyler a call to see what he was up too.  He was cruising by to go get some fish for his tank or whatever, so we decided to hang out.  He came and picked me up and we headed over to Petco. Once we got the fishies, we figured we'd head back to his place to watch movies and stuff (so I had to call to make sure that was ok and all...which it was).  So we headed over there ( I had never been in there before - wasn't really what I expected it to be).  We hung out, and watched TV and all, had fun and shit...then he brought me home around a quarter till 12, and I walked in and got changed into my fuckin awesome Fruit Loops pants, and sat down at the computer...and that ladies and gentlemen, is an update!

Luv The Ringmaster!

PS I know this is random, but ""FUCK!!!!!""  No one has any idea what I am talking about, but had to get it off my chest...so yeah...I feel better now...   ;-)"

"event","Hola ppl!  I am sorry to have left everyone with such an angry entry last night.  Things have been really crazy lately, and I haven't really felt wanted with the whole Christmas season upon me and all.  Sorry if I did upset anyone with it...

Well, sleeping last night helped a lot.  I haven't been sleeping lately and it helped to.  I don't know what I am going to do about everything and all, but I will figure it all out soon enough I guess...

Well, I better go cause I have to call ppl, and take a shower - I have to freakin work today - 3:30 to 9:30 - yay, but it shouldn't be too bad cause I do work with Chris, so Merry Christmas everybody!

"event","I don't know what'd going on anymore.  I feel like I walk on pin needles, because that's exactly how things are.  I got home from the movies (Phantom - which I advise everyone to go see!) and get on the phone with my uncle, which leaves me in hysteric tears.  

I am so fuckin sick of this shit.  I do not know what the fuck to do anymore. I got so fuckin pissed off at my Uncle on the phone because he reminded me of my dad, and I kept arguing with him and it wasn't making anything better and it was a complete fuckin mess.  And then earlier Lance wanted to get some cigerettes, so I told him I could call Tyler.  But when I did, I just figured he was being a fuckin ass too (which he wasn't now that I think about it).  And I kept thinking he was because he was busy with something else when I wanted him to not be and I was being a fuckin selfish bitch and being a complete ass and I fuckin hung up on him cause I knew why he was busy and it pissed me off like hell.  But it shouldn't - because I'M NOT HIS FUCKIN GIRLFRIEND!!!!!!! And then I thought about callin him because I want to talk to him and all cause I feel like beating the shit outta everything and giving up, but then I decided not to cause he's with his FUCKIN GIRLFRIEND!!!!!!!!

I am so fuckin sick and tired of it all.  Every single guy I encounter I feel threatened by and I do not understand why.  I feel like everyone is out to get a fuckin piece of fuckin Chrissy...and I am so done.  Tyler fuckin used me just cause he was fuckin horny - and I AM SO FUCKIN STUPID FOR NOT SEEING THAT!!!!!  I want to see the good in everyone and I want to think that people do care about me and want to be around me.  No - that's not how it is - everyone is out for their fuckin selves and out to have their own fickin fun.  I'm done - I am so sick of making everyone else so fuckin happy. I am the most god damn unhappy mother fucker I know - and I hate this - I hate feeling like this because I never wanted to feel like this again.  Guess what?  Here it is again, the whole fuckin summer coming back to haunt me...I honestly want to give in right now - I'm done with everything and everyone right now - I can only do so much...and I don't even know what to do with my fuckin self anyways.  I feel like the biggest fuck up in the entire fuckin world - one of the stupidest too.  I have no family, my parents want nothing to do with me, I work at fuckin Taco Bell, school is shit, my friends are there whenever the hell they feel like it, Tyler could give a flying fuck about me because he has a fuckin wife to take care of all his needs.  Now, all I am is a fuckin walk-all-over-me, used and abused fuckin mistress.  What a title...now there's something to be proud of...I'm done.

After finally getting off the computer at like 5 or so, I went into my room and decided to make a sappy love mix titled ""Late Night Pain"" (The title came from Sheep - thanks Lauren!).  I was just in the mood to sit around and well, sit around.  Well, in about 10 minutes or so, I made this mix:

Yeah, i was orignially gonna point out the ones that made me cry my eyes out, but that would be a waste - because they all did.  I haven't cried like that in a long time - I can't even remember the last time I did.  I must've been like 5 years old and crying about some damn doll I couldn't have or something.  It hurt so much - I can't even describe it.  Everything just kept rushing at me with every word being sang - every voice preaching a song's true meaning.  I was told once by him that it's not good to carry stories to music, cause then everytime that you hear them, that's what you think of.  Well, I can't help it - I wish I could.  Because there always seems to be more sad and miserable stories I hold to songs more than the good times that I should.  It sucks like crazy.  I finally fell asleep at 6:45 in the morning (I almost saw the sun rise, but I fell asleep before it really came up).  I woke up at about 10:30 this morning. It was the weridest feeling to wake up and find the dried spots of tears all over your pillow.  It made me cry even more, because it shouldn't be that way - it shouldn't.  I should be happy, but everything right now is so messed up.  I don't know where to start with it all and I keep thinking that everything is going to end up for the worst, and now I'm starting to believe that that's the truth now too.  Gosh, it hurts so much...why can't one thing - just one thing - go my way?  It drives me crazy.  I give so much to people - I do everything I can to make other people's suns shine bright and never be tormented by some gloomy rain cloud out to get them.  When the hell is someone gonna do that for me?  I have spent so much of my time and my life making him happy...why can't he see that?  Why can't he see this great, wonderful, kick-ass chick right in front of him, who loves him for EVERYTHING about him - the good and the bad - and for everything, not just for somethings that she only knows about.  She doesn't know him like I do.  She know's the guy that she wants to see - the guy that he only let's her see a little of.  Me, I know him for him. I've been there, and he can be the biggest ass in the entire world - NO JOKE - but can be the biggest sweetheart with a simple hug and just plainly being there to listen.  You know, when no one was there for him - when everyone else was too damn focused on their own fuckin problems - I was there.  I spent about 7 hours of my night to sit on the phone with him and keep him company, reminding him constantly that I am ALWAYS THERE FOR HIM.  I didn't hang up until I knew that he wanted to.  Because I was there for him, and I always have been.  So why the hell would he throw that away?  WHY? I have done no wrong to him - none. All I've done is love him and be there for him...and in the end I am still absolutely nothing to him...it's not fair - and it shouldn't be this way...it just plainly shouldn't...

I asked Lauren for some advice last night...I read over thes entries that I have posted, and realized a lot of them had to do with him. SO I asked her if I should show them to him...she said that if I wanted him to know how i really feel and I wanted to show him what I am fighting for that I should.  Well, here it is - decision time - and once I leave here I'm gonna call him and tell him to read this.  Because Lauren's right - I do want those things.

So, I don't know if this is a waste of space or anything, but I've taken so many chance already - what's another?  Tyler, if you're reading this right now, first of all, thanks.  Have to say that I was hesitate to know if you would.  This is everything - everything that you really don't hear from me because I keep trying to be a good girl and not let you see the real me and everything that's going on right now.  I'm really unhappy - something you probably didn't know until now (I tend to be a pretty good actress).  And a lot of it has to do with you (granted, remember that it isn't all you either - my family and all is a big part...).  I'm so afraid of losing you. I know that we keep trying to be just friends - and strictly friends - but it never works.  I care about you so much - and maybe now you'll see that a little bit clearly.  I just don't want to lose you - and I don't think you want to lose me.  You always seem a little more happier when you're with me...it could just be me, but I don't honestly think so...I've been there for you through thick and thin - remember that - and there have been so many times that I wanted to just give up on you  -I even tried to, remember?  But I didn't.  Because I promised you that I would always be there for you when everyone else has their backs turned towards you.  And you know me...I don't break promises, and I have never broken that one either - because I love you so much.

Well, hopefully that's not a waste of space - I pray to some God that it isn't.  Well, it's now or never...knowing my luck I'll get hid voice mail...I'm nervous...but I know it has to be done...he needs to see this.

Luv, Chrissy

PS It's like 12:38 right now, and I was looking over this...and since you (that being Tyler) are sitting around talking about Christmas lights with your mom and I'm just chillin' here, I remembered something that I should have said before:  If you can't talk to me about this (which I'm pretty sure you can't, seeing you couldn't talk about my boat-note or the voice mail I left for you) then leave a comment or something...it's basically a note, and I really need you to talk to me about this...please - I'm being really nice now...please...        :-)"

// REAL QUESTIONS (-and the others were fake?)
1) Do you believe in God? If so, why? If not, why not? Name one or more events that have led you to this: 

I believe that there is a God out there.  I'm not realy sure who or what that may be...I don't know if I ever will.  There have been numerous event in my life that have made me believe that there is something. Events that couldn't really be explained or whatever, you know?  But I just don't really know what that is yet...

2) Do you believe that all things happen for a reason? Why or why not? 

Yes and no.  I do, but when it doesn't go my way, I like to think that is doesn't.  I'm really picky like that - actually, the word is selfish, but figured picky sounded better.  I guess it's cause my life is so dam hectic - I kinda want things to go my way for once, so I believe what I think will make that happen.

3) Who is your best friend (ONE)? Why? Who are your other good friends and why aren't they your best friends? 

To be honest, Dana.  She's not really just that though - she's my sister.  And that explains a lot right there.  But there is also the rest of the crew listed above.  I can't really explain why she's supposively ""higher"" than the others - I don't think of it that way.

4) Do you drink (alcohol)? Do you smoke? Do you do drugs? Why or why not? 

Oh...what a topic...I'm not gonna lie - so bear with me people...Yes I do drink - I think it's a lot of fun when your smart about it and don't drive and just stay in one place and all.  When it comes to smoking, I hate - and I mean HATE - cigerette smoking.  I think a lot of that has to do with my mom and my grandma.  They have smoked pretty much all of my life, and I hate it.  When I visit, I kick them out of their house and make them smoke outside...I hate it that much.  When it comes to pot, I don't really have a problem with it.  I started really smoking pot when I worked at McDonald's, but I haven't done that in awhile (I've been pretty good about it).  I wouldn't mind doing it though...just not really sure with who yet.  When it comes to drugs...uhhh, what a subject!  Over the summer, I was very much addicted to pills and the whole rush I got from popping pills.  I'm not any more because of a suicide attempt that I made with them and almost died.  It's been kinda hard, I will admit, to lay off of pills, but I have been doing really well with it!  Lately, I've been kinda getting into cough medicine.Yeah, I know it sounds weird and all, but someone told me about how a lot of his friends got hooked on it cause there's some drug in it (I can't remember the name), so I ended up trying it one night (there was a party at my house that was kinda goin down hill - that's not an excuse, but I'm just setting the scene).  It was different, but I think I could get hooked - so I haven't taken any in awhile...which is good.  I have to say that lately I have been kind of interested in E - a lot of ppl have been talking to me about it, and I don't know what I think about it...sorry this one was so long - figured I wouldn't lie, so I had a lot to say.

5) Name and describe one life changing event. Do you wish this had happened? Explain. 

Almost 16 weeks ago this coming Friday, when my Dad hit me and a week later I left my house.  I wish it never happend - it was the scariest day of my entire life - probably one for the two friends I got involved too.  And since then, things have been nothing with my family - we don't even talk anymore.  The last time we did was when my brother Marcus had about 6 or 7 seizures and was admitted to UC Davis.  I've kept in touch with him through AIM and at school, but other than that, my family and I don't talk.

6) Do you have any secrets? If so, can you tell one? If so, tell one. 

Of course - I have a lot of secrets - I even revealed some with the whole drug question.  I have a lot of secrets that ppl don't know about...maybe it's a good thing.  I sometimes think it is, cause I don't want to upset ppl or any of the ppl that I really care about...so, when it comes to telling one, I think I just did.

7) Name a few people that you are glad you have met this year, and why. 

Ashlie V from Colorguard/Band and Winterguard - MY MINI ME!!!  I love her so much!!!!!  I'm so thankful to have gotten to know her!

Kevin and Cameron - two ppl in Band I didn't know until their continuous note passing during Band with Ashlie.  They actually aren't that bad of guys!

Danny - love him to death too!  he's such a boy WG protege!

Izzy - my waldo...I love her - she's so unique and just so damn cute!


8) If you could go back in time, would you change anything? If so, what? If not, what would you change if you had to change something? 

To change something...gosh...you know, I always wondered what my life would've been like if I never worked at McDonald's...I don't take it back - I don't want anything to change because what happened happened.  But i wonder sometimes, u know?  Maybe I would be a completely different person...I don't know...there's something to ponder...


9) If you were granted one wish and had to take it, what would you wish for? 

*thinking*...................I wanna say something that means something else, but my mind has been on this for the past few days, so I guess if I had to make a wish RIGHT NOW, this would be it:

To love and be loved by him.

10) Tell something that no one knows. Something that you have never told anyone before. 

Well, there's a lot I could say actually (depends on what the subject matter should be).....*thinking again*.....ok, this is probably something that not a lot of ppl really want to know about me, but I can't think of anything else, and it's like 4 in the morning...so sorry...here it is: I'm a moaner...I'll let your minds ponder that one...


11) If you could go forward in time and see one thing, what would it be and why? 

Where I am in my life in about 25 years...just curious about it I guess...


12) What's your biggest fear that something will happen? (not insecets, bad weather, etc.) 

My biggest fear since day one has been feeling emotional hurt and pain.  I have had to feel a lot of it, and I hate it with a passion.  Now I am experiancing it - because I think I have lost someone I never wanted to lose...


13) Who aggrivates you / you hate the most? Why? 

Aggravates and hates are two different things. Therefore, two seperate answers:

Tyler aggravates me the most - by far...with all of the games, Saturday night/Sunday Mornings events, and everything like that - of course he aggravates me... maybe that's why i love him...i dunno - I'm weird like that I guess!

I have only hated 3 people before in my life: 1)My dad - for hitting me, 2)My mom's bf - for being the reason that I think my mom has not been in my life, and 3)Tyler - for when he hurt me so much I didn't know what to do to make the pain go away  (bet he doesn't know that one...probably can't even pin-point when that was...how bout a certain Sarah that I met and what she told me and then the angry message with fuck in it about 30 times at least...yeah)

14) If you were to die at this second: Would you go to heaven, hell, neither, etc? What would you regret, if anything? 

No question about it - I would go to hell.  I have no doubt in that right now...I have done some fucked up things...cheated on ppl (well, one person to be specific, but that doesn't make it ok), been the one somebody cheated on their gf with, lied, hurt, stole, done way too much shit that I don't even want to count out...I would definately go to hell.

15) What do you want your last words to be? 

Learn from your mistakes - we all have one life to live, and it shouldn't be on stupid shit.  Be able to let your last words be of praise and happiness in your life - be happy with the life you've lived.  Basically, live everyday like it's your last - because one of these days, it will be. (I know that's a lot of ""last words"" and all, but I had a lot to say...and it's me - come on, what do you expect from a talker?)"

"event","Yeah - it's like almost 2 in the morning and I'm not tired at all, so that's why I decided to leave you all with yet another entry!  I figured this could entertain some, scare some other, you know - all that fun shit!

Hope everyone noticed a few changes since last time...yeah - with Sheep's help, I managed to give this ol thing some personality!  Yeah!  (Speaking of that, how bout that Usher pic?  DAMMMMMNNNNNNNN....)

Well, let me fill you all in on my night!  It was quite the excitement.  Dana and I met Alyssa and company at Chico High at around 7:40 because Stephen (being the cutie bf that he is - guys, you need to take notes right about now!) rented a limo for Lance for Christmas!  It was so cute!  After the limo showed up about a half an hour late, we all piled in to pick up Lance and Stephen at this one park or whatever, where they were greeted with their song by Avril and roses for Lance (SO CUTE!!!).  Then we headed out for the Christmas light tour.  That was cool - some people have way too much time on their hands though!  After that, we decided to go to Baskin Robbins.  And seeing that I had just recently gone there a couple days ago with Tyler (speaking of him...I'll get to that boy later...), so I wasn't quite in the mood for my usual Daquiri Ice ice cream.  So I ended up getting a Mocha Blast (maybe that's why I'm still wide awake right now...hmm, never thought of that one!).  It was delicious - and then Dana and I headed into the limo while the rest of the crew was getting their desserts.  In pure Chrissy fashion, I dug through Stephen's CD case to pull out none other than my man - who is the finest thing in the world (omg.....*moment to appriciate that man*) - Usher.  (Had to get a little bit of ""Yeah!"" up in there!).  Once everyone piled back in, we decided to play the infamous 10 fingers game (Ladies, you remember that one, right?  The one where we first encountered ""feet""?).  Well, to no one's surprise, Lance is the dirtiest thing out there, followed by the rest of the gay boys and Alyssa.  I was the dirtiest straight girl (not sure if I should be proud or not..oh well - still a win!) and Dana was the little angel out of the group (uhhh....yeah...no comment...).  So things were getting a little on the boring side, so we all decided to play the classic game of Truth or Dare.  Yeah, very interesting...I got my tit licked by none other than the Lance boy himself (yeah - it was weird), I gave my first hickey to Corey (and we're talking the gay one here), Alyssa got some ice down her shirt and gave a very impressive kissing job on this one dude (who I can't remember his name right now...damn) all over his chest (it was pretty damn hot!), Corey gave Alyssa's ear some action, Dana talked to a random biker and got a # (which turned out to be fake), and I think that was about it...there's probably more, but my brain isn't registering it right now!  So after we got dropped off and all, Dana and I headed to Tomas' house, where we talked, they bit eachother, and I stole another sweatshirt (yeah baby!).  I had the munchies after that, so I made Dana take me over to Jack In The Box where I got a a large curly frie (yummy!).  Then we got home, and I got on the computer...that leads to now!

Wow, just to remind you if you haven't already noticed - this is hella long!  Sorry - still awake and not really having anything else to do!

Uhh...what else is there - oh, I have been wearing my hair down a lot lately!  Straight too!  I discovered the greatness in a ceramic straightener.  Once Dana teaches me how to do it on my own, I think I'm gonna stick with this hair style - I am one hot sexy bitch with it!

In other news, just kinda remembered that Victor (you know - Taco Bell worker - went on my first date with him...) hasn't really called me much...Now I'm thinking this is gonna end up how Dana and Nick were after their first date...which sucks, cause Victor is suck a cool dude - a true gentlemen as well!  Dana's parents were in love with him!  I think I kinda lost sight of him too...

And that would be becuase of none other than the above mentioned that I said I would get to later (which is right now)...*drum roll*...Tyler...*pause of mixed angry and sad frustration*...Yeah - I'll admit it...things have been kinda fucked up lately because of some things with him again. And I know a lot of you are gonna be rolling your eyes and shaking your heads right about now (I know you guys too well), but it's all been my decisions and stuff, so just remember that.  I dunno (hey - I say that a lot about him)...things have always been weird with him.  We try a lot to just be friends, and once I finally start to accept that and all, it turns back towards the other end of the spectrum - and not by my hands either (ok - that sounded a little kinky - didn't mean it like that!).  It's crazy...it really is...I wish he could see this stuff, you know?  Maybe then he'd realize the kind of shit going on...and stuff...(plus I think he would get a kick out of it - it'd give him something to do...).  Let me break it down:

I know that not everyone can really relate to this, but I'm still gonna go with it:  Have you ever loved someone so much that it hurt?  I'm talking this kind of hurt that you can't even describe or capture in a bottle...something you don't even want your worst enemies to experiance?  That's how it is with him.  I care about him so much, and it hurts even more to know that he takes it all for granted too.  He's with this chick that frustrates him more than makes him happy, and he can't even see that damn greatness sitting on the other end of the phone or across from in at Baskin Robbins or in the passenger's seat of his car.  He's doing the same thing he did when I first met him...talking the same shit about his gf now, complaining about every little thing about her.  Yet he can't get enough balls to dump her.  He says that he loves her, which I believe, but ( and there's a huge BUT to the end of that) why do the things he does?  Why does he still hang on to me when his gf says no?  I now get named Blake or Richard whenever I'm with him and she calls.  It hurts a lot - I don't tell him that, even though I probably should, but it does...I used to wonder why he hided me from her, because nothing was going on. But that's the thing - nothing WAS going on...there was nothing there between us (I take that back - there was nothing there on his side - there always was and has been and still is something on my side).  But that's not the case...and these past few days are prime example and proof of that.  So why are things like this?  I know that I can only do so much - show him the kind of gal that he's missing out on because he's stuck not knowing what to do.  He knows he would be happier - I know it too.  He always seems to be when I'm with him...it just hurts a lot.  I wish he knew that you know?  I miss being with him so much - and knowing that he wanted to be with me...cause lately (and as much as I am fighting to not believe this as the truth - I pray to some God that it isn't - I don't want it to be) I've been thinking that he is taking me for granted, and possibly using me.  it hurts so much just to even think about it.  When I'm all upset like this, I want to be able to call him and talk to him cause he always seems to know how to make things better.  But I can't.  Because...well, I don't know exactly why.  All I know is that I can't.  And that makes this knife slide even further into my flesh (u know, not literally - just making sure!).  Gosh...now I'm all upset and stuff...I hate feeling like this. And it's really hard too.  Because I've now created this huge pickle.  He's my first love - one of my only true loves - yet, he has become one of my best friends...how do you divide those lines?  I don't know if that makes any sense or all - does it?  I don't know anymore...

Well, seeing that this is hella long as it is, I think I'll head out.  I think I'll go get into some pj's, roll into bed, and play my sappy love mix...maybe I'll make a new one...not like I need a good cry right now, but I don't know what else to do...so, goodnight to all!

Luv, Chrissy"

"event","Well, going off of the last entry, here is what happened:

I called his phone and didn't get him (which is actually what I wanted to happen).  So I left a message about everything.  And I did something I didn't want to - I cried not even 10 seconds into it.  It was really hard for me to do...Now I just have to hope and pray that he gets it (cause his phone is retarded) and see what happens...right now I'm looking at it from the worst possible scenario - that would explain the heading of this entry...

On top of that, there is this other stuff - Christmas.  It is seriously driving me insane.  My uncle keeps telling me what I should do and it makes me all confused and stuff, and honestly I don't even want to celebrate it anymore - you're supposed to spend the holidays with your family, and my family and I are no more - so what's the point?  i don't even understand or know what family is anymore...I dunno...

"event","Ok, I am not really sure where to start with all of this.  I'm kinda gonna be talking about something that hasn't happened yet, but is going to right after I am done with this.  So, this could make sense - this could not - but hopefully it'll help me.

Have you ever had to come to this huge fork in the road and not know what to do?  Well, actually, you know what you want to do, and what you should do.  Those are your two decisions.  And it should be easy - you should do what you're supposed to - that would make things plain and simple and less dramatic and messy.  But then there's a part of you that just wants everything to keep going as they are, in hope that somebody else will have to make the choices and changes.  Well, that is where I am right now.  I have a choice to make, and I know that I just want everything to keep playing on like it has these past couple of days, but deep down, I know the truth.  I finally told Dana something I should've told her from the get go, and while doing so, I told Erin as well.  She said the one thing I think I needed to hear too.  The one thing that I knew deep down, but did not want to recognize at all.  And now that leads me to this vey moment, where I know what needs to be done and I'm just afraid to do it.  But one thing that I have learned lately is that I am a born leader - one of those people that looks fear in the eye and says fuck you - I'm gonna win.  Well, this can not, and WILL NOT be an exception to that philosophy.  I gotta lay it all on the line, and in pure Dana and Chrissy form, be like ""Bitch - WHAT???""  (yeah...we're dumb...I know...)

But anyhoo, I know that there is stuff that I need to get done (Like my WEST English final on a book that I haven't finished yet!), but I just don't feel like diong it!  I guess that's the lazy part of me coming out!  This whole vacation thing is weird and all - I keep thinking that I'm ditching school or something!  I dunno...I guess I miss being all busy and stuff...in a weird way and all...ok, now I realize that I'm just kinda rambling and stuff, and I'm hungry, so I think I'll make a grand exit...

"event","Well, let's see....I feel like I'm forgetting something that I have to do...this whole vacation thing is throwing me off!  Anyhoo, not too much going on right now...Last night wasn't bad.  Tyler came over and we talked for awhile (I got to show him my room, which by the way is flippin' awesome - I have these two really cool posters and then I printed out all of my poems and slapped them up there - I call it ""The Poem Wall."").  We were gonna go see a movie and all, but then decided to get ice cream instead.  So we went to Baskin Robbins and sat around talking and stuff.  Then we went to Best Buy cause he had a $150 gift certificate and all.  The nRoger called me wondering when I was coming home and all cause he didn't know and then he kinda went off on me about how he had to call Dana too and stuff.  So we went back to my house and he was gonna stay over and watch a movie or something, but then had to go sit at a damn tattoo parlor with Ashley or whatever, so we hung out in his car for a little bit, until Dana pulled up behind us, and then we said goodbye and I went inside - and oh - I watched Dodge Ball last night - Fuckin hilarious movie!  OMG!  Yeah - and speaking of the time, better go - I'm supposed to call Tyler and wake him up - he said he'd come over or whatever...so, later!

I AM GONNA DRIVE MYSELF CRAZY WITH THIS SHIT!!!!!  I wish I could go into it, but that would leave a hella long entry, and it would just be crazy and confusing and shit...so yeah...maybe I'll just have a night in and by a shit load of crap that's not good for me and vegge out with some movies or something...I dunno - what do you guys think?

"event","Ok, I don't even know where to begin right now.  I wanna talk about everything going on in my head right now, but I made a promise not to say it all, so this might not make sense to a lot of ppl, but work with me here!

Well, let's think...where to begin...Saturday was a little different.  Tried to get ppl to go to Rock N Bowl, but that didn't work.  So I went to Poker Night at Nates with Dana and Lauren.  Was there for like an hour or so until Lance called and told me about this Drag Show he was going to, so I went with him and Stephen (his bf).  Well, had some boring times, had some good times (we busted out with the Goodies dance - yeah baby!!!!).  Stephen wanted to go home, and it was like 11, so knowing me, I decide that I don't wanna go home, and call Tyler to see what he's doing.  After two calls which ended in ""call me later cause I'm dropping off Ashley,"" I met him at Jack In The Box.  Yeah,talked for awhile (SERIOUSLY) and then he dropped me off at the house at like midnight.  We sat in his car till 12:45 and talked and hung out (trust me - I was a good girl and all...I told him I was going to be.)  Then I went inside and went to bed.

This is where the story creates this huge fuzzy cloud.  I wanna say something and all, but I can't.  So let me just put it in some terms that could make sense....I dunno, stuff....let's just say right now, I am honestly confused as hell, and feel really stupid and all.  And I know that no one can understand what I'm talking about right now, but that's it. Honestly, I wish I could say more, but I can't.  

I got about 3 hours of sleep that night (went to bed at about 4:30, woke up around 8) and went to work at 9.  Wasn't too bad, got sent home early cause it was hella slow and all.  Got ready for practice, I called Tyler and was freaking out because of the unsaid, and then told him I needed to talk to him about some stuff and wanted him to meet me at my break during practice.  So he was like ok and all, so this made me freak out even more because of what I needed to talk about (I know this isn't making much sense, but try to follow!).  Went to practice, which at first I thought would help with my thinking and all - NOPE!!!!!!  I kept having the hardest time with everything cause I couldn't concentrate and all, and then it got worse cause I started thinkin out loud to the Rifles and that got kinda confusing and all...and then Melissa noticed that I was getting hella frustrated and told me to chill and all, which made me feel worse because I hate it when I start showing on the outside how I am on the inside. Oh - and Tyler didn't come cause he went to a fuckin Christmas thingy and told me not to call him cause Ashley was with him....yeah.....So, came home, broke down and cried, so I called LaShona and asked her what she was doing, and I went over there for the night.  She was all cool and stuff, and we talked. And knowing me, when I'm all blue and stuff, what do I do?  Make a drastic change - so we dyed my hair and straightened it!  I am a hot sexy beast right now!  Except for the pj's....which by the way, I need to get out of, so I'm gonna go now...

"event","Well, what to say what to say...last night, from my point of view, had it's ups and downs.  But I had a blast!  Denny's was awesome - the food never tasted so good! Although, it did kinda suck to walk into work a half and hour late and all, but Bob (my boss) didn't get on my case too much - Oh, and I hadn't worked in a week, so I had no idea that there was a crew meeting this morning at 7 am, so that kinda sucked to find out about...Damn Chris - she's supposed to tell me stuff like that....lol.

Uhh, yeah, I really don't know where the whole ""I like Blake"" thing came from...it's kinda odd...he'd be a cool hook up though...ok, no more bad thoughts!  As Dana would say, ""Outta my mind, Outta my mind!""

Uhh, what else is there...oh - Anthony came be today and dropped off Christmas cards for Dana and I - OMG - News Break - watching MTV Countdown, guess what videos on - BURN.....<taking moment to scream my little head off and punch something....>  Ok, now back to the regular program...the card was really cute and all, and it got me thinking again.  About him and I, a him and i at all.  I dunno what I want anymore.  One minute I think I know, but then something else comes up.  Like right now, with this song on and all, all I can think about is Tyler.  Because that's what the song is associated with in my head.  I miss him - I'm gonna stop lying and trying to fool myself.  I miss not being with him so much, and i feel do weak for admitting it, but I can't hide it anymore.  He means the world to me, and yeah - I still wanna be with him so much.  It hurts a lot to hear him talk about Ashley and everything and not say anything about it.  I miss him , and I wish he could understand this all, cause he doesn't.  I love him so much, and I don't think he'll ever comprehend that at all.  It hurts, cause he gets so upset about all the problems he has with Ashley and all (sometimes it makes me think he's just with her for her sake - Dana brought that up once).  It kills me to hear him all upset and stuff, and know that I can't do anything about it, even though I want to so much...I have never wanted to be with someone so much.  He's so different you guys.  I know that a lot of my friends hate his guts and all, but he is so different.  He gets me, and I'm not saying that no one else does or anything like that.  He's just someone very special to me, and I know that I should let him go and not be around him ro talk to him to get over him, but I can't.  I told him that I would always be there for him when no one else is.  And he said he didn't want to lose me as a friend.  I'm just going to have to be strong and put my emotions and feelings aside from him.  I know that one of these days he's going to realize that he is missing a great thing, and that he made mistake losing me.  The saddest part about that: it's gonna be the day after I get completely over him, and he will have to really experiance that kind of karma.  So, yeah - gonna go - this is giving me too much to think about....

Concert last night was good - I didn't play my best though, which knowing me, pissed me off and all.  Robby and Ryan's band though were awesome!  It made me think more though, and that wasn't good.  I don't know, it's just weird now.  Ryan used to be one of my close friends, and I miss that a lot. But I have pretty much 100% confidence that he wants nothing to do with me at all anymore.  I thought about talking to him about it and all, but every chance I get, I choke.  I think it's cause I'm scared of what could happen. I don't know...

Well, I'll leave you with what I do best - think...with this poem

My walls cave in
Nothing more simple than that.
I wish I could abolish them,
Tear down the very Hitler that they are.
Worst of all, within their structure and purpose,
Lies this tiny hole.
A small glimpse of light
Signifying the end to that trecherous tunnel.
I wish I could cover it up,
Seal it from giving me hope of such hopeless occasions.
Because within that hole I live my life,
On the dying need to see the complete light,
And embark away from this tunnel."

"event","Well, I must admit - I am really liking having this journal.  I have missed that security blanket that I had formed by having one.  Thanks Norm for the great reference!  :-)

I don't even know where to begin.  Life has thrown me so many curve balls lately - it's amazing to see me still putting up a good fight.  I'll be completely honest - I have had a rough time keeping that spirit of always looking on the brighter side.  it has gotten a little odd now - I tend to have the greatest days and be loving my happiness.  But when I get home, by myself and having just my analyzing around, all of those happy moments turn into masks that I feel like I so violently wear to sheild everyone away from me.  I spen most of my nights crying my eyes to sleep and asking why.  It shouldn't be like that, and I know that.  But for soem reason, I feel the need to fix everything - make everyone's problems go away and become solved.  I guess while doing everyone else's math homework, I forget about my own...

Well, on a lighter note, I'M SICK!!!  Stupid Victor...I'm mad at him right now!  I think actually that I'm not so single anymore...it's weird, and to be honest, doesn't feel completely right.  I can't really put my finger on the specifics of it, but I can come to this conclusion: I have tried so hard to let those emotions and feelings go.  For some reason, I can't let it Burn.  I wish I knew why, but I do not know.  

I'm excited and scared about tomorrow though!  You all know how much I love a party, but I am still scared as to how it will all play out.  My money is on drama ringing the door bell!  LOL!  Well, with such hypothesises, I will say goodnight, and try to get some damn sleep!

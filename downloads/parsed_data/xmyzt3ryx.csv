I am extremlly sore from hanging with
James Steve and Brad at james's place
Doin crazy shit breaking stuff Inflicting pain on ourselves
But yeah It was all cool till
Steve and Brad tried breaking my ribs
They still hurt very bad

And somehow Steve managed to put a fucking BB through my window
It completly baffles me how one could be so fucking STUPID
I would think one would shoot the ground first to make
sure theres nothing in it before you aim at the window and shoot
Or even shake the gun and listen to hear if theres any BB's In It
Steve said he will pay for It so Its all good
But holy shit that kid cant get any stupider sometimes

I havent been online anymore because Im either at james's
Or I dont feel like being online
Im usually at james's because thats where my true friends are
The ones that dont like to cause drama or make me feel bad
The ones i can just hang our with
All day, watch TV and not be bored
I bet If Me, James, Steve, Adam and Jackie were all put
In a empty room we could entertain ourselves all day

Just about the only problem I have there Is I cant hang
With James and play video games
We have been doing that for four years
And Its our favorite thing to do =(

Ive pretty much given up on trying to find a girlfriend
It seems the ones Im interested In either dont like me
Have a boyfriend Or they love to make my life
A living fucking hell
Not to mention the fact that I HAVE A JOB
That should not be a reason for a girl not to like me
Ive had that one before and Its BS

Here Is to any girl out there that I may date:
1.I have a job and I work shitty hours So I may not
   Be able to devote every second to you
2.I have GREAT friends!
   If you dont get along with them your history
   They come before ANYONE
3. I HATE DRAMA!
   So If I get any from you goodbye


I guess this entry Is long enough
Ill write again when I feel the need"

You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through,

Theres that for starters It pretty much sums up my feelings
Not just cause of Adam Im not to shaken up by that anymore now that I know he will me ok
But Im just incredibally lonely now because everyone loves to start drama
So I ignore them because I dont want anymore drama
Even tho Im dead sure as long as Im here I will always have drama
Because It Is oswego n all and everyoen without a dick Is a drama-queen
And Im dead sure there Is a couple guys who are drama-gueens too

If anyone would like to enlighten me on how to make backgrounds and all that cool shit
On my livejournal Post and let me know!

Im In a terabile mood so I think Im done for now

Me James Steve and Adam were hanging out killing time
We went to Lowes to fuck around
Went to BK to get some food
Went to JC Pennys to Fuck around
Went to annoy our friend Joe
And It ended up with Me and Adam riding on the truck of James's car on Butternut Ave.
We went to fast around a turn and Adam fell off and hit his head on the pavement
I was right next to him and It was either him Or both of us falling off
I tried everything I could possibally do to get him But It odviously didnt work
Adam was drove to Fulton then airlifted to Syracuse University Hospital
ONLY because It was a head injury
He really Is fine and should be out In a week or so
But anyways
After he was driven away Me James Steve and Jackie had to ride In seperate cars
Down to the Sheriff's Department for our ""Statement"" but they ended up keeping us there for FIVE FUCKING HOURS
Interrogating us INSISTING we were drunk or high even though we told them we werent several times
Imagine a Criminal Investigator and Two cops staring you In face while they INSIST you were smoking pot
Then trying to say James tried to kill Adam
Adam Is consious and speaking joking around HE IS FINE
Adam was the only one hurt
There were no drugs or alcohol
This Is NO-ONES fault at all
James has to go back Tuesday at 3pm
And the Investigator has my home number cell number and my adress and said he would call me sometime
To come back In for further ""Questioning""
I do not apreciate all the ""Drama"" after all the serous drama
You know like my friend being in the hospital then getting blamed for It by the police and Interogated
The last thing I want Is people talking there shit and starting Gossip over things they know NOTHING about
All this has gotten blown WAY out of propotion
It Is nothing more then a bunch of teenagers bored fucking around
There Is NO reason why It should of gotten so bad
Oh My bad I forgot
PEOPLE FUCKING SUCK
OSWEGO SUCKS
And Also All you FUCKING DRAMA-QUEENS OUT THERE
I wont name any names yet but feel free to post and leave any further details on the situation
And If you would like to know anymore ASK ME, JAMES, STEVE, ADAM, OR JACKIE!
DO NOT go asking others because thats how all this got so bad
GOSSIP AND DRAMA DO NOT MIX WITH REAL LIFE SERIOUS SHIT
I would much appreciate If all the bullshit ended

Id like to sing a song about the americain dream
About me
About you
About the way our americain hearts beat
Way down deep In our chest
About that special feelign we get in the Cockels of our heart
Maybe below the cockels
Somewhere In the sub cockels area
Maybe In the liver
Maybe In the kidneys
Maybe even In the colin
We dont know

In just a regular joe
With a regular job
Im your avreage white suburbinite slob
I like football n porno and books about war
I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor
My wife n my job my kids and my car
My feet on the table and a cuban cigar
But sometimes that just aint enough
To keep a man like me Interested
No Ive gotta go out and have fun
At someone elses expence
Yeah

I drive really slow In the ultra-fast lane
While people behind me are going insaine
Im an asshole
Im an asshole
I use public toilets and I pisson the seat
I walk around In the summertime saying
""How about this heat""
Im an asshole
Sometimes I park In the handicapped spaces
While Handicapped people
Make Handicapped faces
Im an asshole
Im an asshole

Maybe I shouldnt be singing this song
Ranting and ravin and carryin on

Im gonna get myself a 1967 Cadallac El dorado convertable
HOT PINK with whaleskin hubcappes and all leather cow interier
And big brown baby seal eyes for headlights YEAH!
And Im gonan drive around in that baby at 115 miles per hour
Getting one mile per gallon sucking down
Quarter pounders with cheeseburgers from Mcdonalds
In the old-fashioned non Bio-degradable styrafoam containers
And when Im done sucking down those grease ball burgers
Im gonan wipe my ass with the american flag
And then Im gonna toss those styrafoam containers right out the side
And there aint a god damned thing anyone can do about it
You know why?
Because WE got the bombs
Thats why
Two words
NUCULEAR FUCKING WEAPONS!
OK!
Russisa, Germany, Romania
They can have all the democracy they want
They can have a big democracy cake
and walk right through the middle of the tienament square
And It wont make a lick of difference because
WE GOT THE BOMBS
OK!
John waynes not dead He's frozen
And as soon as we find a cure for cancer

And, uh, all those late night promises I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby, what's the story? Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made? 
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away.
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was 
good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me what it takes to let you go. 

Yeah
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E. Fine
but your love made me a prisoner, yeah my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was 
good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice
No no no no 'cause I don't wanna burn in paradise
Ooo Let go, let go, let go,
let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, 
let it go, let it go, let it go,

"event","This might be my last entry I am growing very sick of the computor
And just about everything else for that matter
I am especially sick of females
I think Im gonna fucking stay single till Im thirty

Amber and I arnt dating for numerous reasons
1. She wasnt happy with me
2. She considers me a ""Brother"" 3.
She considers me a ""Good friend""
mmmmhmmm I say there BULLSHIT EXCUSES to fuck me over and crush me for NO FUCKING REASON
I have lost just about all faith In females and I feel they fucking love to toy with my head
I feel that every girl I know Just wants to make my life much worse
And I know alot of girls...so that adds up

Im pretty confident that this entry will piss alot of people off
And there will be alot of angry posts
But before they start remember this:
I will not deal with It I am not In a good mood nor will I put Up with more stupid pathetic bullshit
So If you decide to start anything You will regret it.. 

Now that I got that said and over with...
I hope Amber Is happy with her meaningless existence Cause she Is nothing to me
She had her shot and she fucked It up She gets no ninth chance..
And actually I dont even want to talk to her anymore I dont even wanna write this anymore...
So Im out

And I swear I havent stoped smiling since!

I know that alot of people are pissed

But I do not care They can be pissed all they
Want...and they can start all the shit they want
It will do them no good.

Gettin pretty fed up with the shit so Im startin to wonder
Should I close the journal n just quit talkin to people for a while?
Go find a peacefull place and stay there with no computor or phone?

I havent really slept much latelly
Or eaten much...or smoked much
I have barely listened to any music
And I never smile..
It Is hell and I just dont feel like me anymore :(

So from now on no-one start any shit with Amber!
Startin anything with her Is like startin things with me
I think Im just gonna quit talking to her...It seems to be what she wants
And anyone out there PLEASE (I cannot stress this enough)
Refrain at all costs for sending more shit my way!
If any of you ever wanna see me happy ever again
Dont cause me more grief and frustration

Becky and Danille no more mean posts to her
No more anonymous posts starting shit
Unless you want this journal closed
Just leave her alone....  :\
And Amber If they do post starting shit...just Ignore It dont start back.
If said all I need to for now

It feels like a fucking car had just been lifted
Off my shoulders
Take a look at this people:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
tabularasa4321: Is this dave?!

DeAd W0r1D: yes of course

tabularasa4321: This is amber's brother brandon.
I think you need to stay the hell away from her before
you hurt her even more.

DeAd W0r1D: do you even know the whole story dude?

tabularasa4321: All I know is that evry night before
I go to sleep, I can hear her crying. and
it's usually right after she talks to you.

DeAd W0r1D: i have barelly talked to her in two fuckin days

tabularasa4321: Your the only guy she's
talked about for 2 weeks. Your the only one who could be making
her cry, and I'm sick of hearing her cry over you.
Amber may not be the greatest person in the world,
but she's still my sister.

DeAd W0r1D: dude to me she is the greatest in
the world...you dont even know the whole fuckin story

tabularasa4321: I don't need to. Leave her alone
and get out of her life.

DeAd W0r1D: can do...but youll hear her cryin more

tabularasa4321: She'll get over it soon enough
It' will be better for her then she realizes,
Not having to cry every night.

DeAd W0r1D: since you seem to know the whole story
you wanna enlighten me to as why she is cryin? 
because it certinally isnt because of me

tabularasa4321: I don't know the story
She tells me bits and pieces every once in awhile,
but your the only reason she could be crying. The only one,
i know her better then you think. When she comes back
and mumbles soemthing about you, turns off the light and
starts crying. it's you.

DeAd W0r1D: well i can tell you this dude me
personally have given her NO reason to be crying....
if you havent noticed she is the one  bringing it on
herself i have done NOTHING but be nice to her and try
to treat her as nice as i possibally can...
but what the fuck ever dude

tabularasa4321: Just get out of her live Dave,
from the sounds of it you don't her in yours anyways
And I Sure as hell don't want you in hers.

DeAd W0r1D: well i certinally want her in mine...
and you cant kick me out of hers...only she can..


tabularasa4321: Dave, get the fuck out of her life.
There's no need for you in it, you only cause more pain.
Your too damn stubborn to realize it you fucking prick.
tabularasa4321 is away at 10:00:21 PM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yup aint that some Bullshit?
But what the fuck ever, Her choice not mine
Ive had two people tell me so far that It was prolly not Ambers bro
So I say this..If It was Amber
Your though, So long get lost FUCK YOU!
And If It was your bro...Imma kick yer ass just cause I dont like you now...
Plus you needa learn not to run your mouth.

Im thinkin Im gonna start an Anti-Amber club : P
Let me know If ya want In : D

Does anyone out there wanna step up to the challange of being my girl?
I needa a new one I broke mine HAHA
If so let me know ; )"

I dont have a fucking clue what Is going on with me and Amber.
Its very depressing, Especially when Im getting mixed signals.
As much as I want to be with her
And the fact she Is the only girl I want OR Is on my mind.
Im starting to feel that I must simply give up on her.

I dont want to have to give up on her.
But I have come to realize I am getting
More bad from her then good.
And I have gotten hurt so many times from her
When me and Amber havent even dated.
Its pretty pathetic on my part that I keep going after her
And I keep wanting to be with her no matter what she does.

So If any of you out there wanna comment and lend me your opinion
I would not mind one bit
Actualy I would love to get some other veiws on my plight.





She Isnt real
I can't make her real"

Hell has seen no fury like me pissed off...
If anyone out there even looks at Amber the wrong way

Here It Is
   1    +   2    +   3    -    2   =   11
Problem  Problems Problems Problems Problems

That Is what Is going on
It Is EXTREMELLY FRUSTRATING
That I solve problems and get more then I started with
I WILL BE WITH AMBER!!
On Feb. 14th
And there Is not a damned thing that can be done about It
And I am gonna solve all my problems
I WILL BE HAPPY WITH AMBER!!

So to you Danielle I say this:
Do not cause me more problems or you will regret It
Do not get In the way of me and amber
Do not try and make me feel quilty...
Do not try and get me back In anyway shape or form
And finally
You are the single person that causes me the most
Grief, Frustration, Problems, Trouble
If  the problems keep coming from you then
I will just plain quit talking to you
And I know thats the worst thing I can do to you.


ANYONE READING THIS
POST AND BUST ON DANIELLE THE BEST YOU CAN
SHE DESERVES IT!!  :D


Now to anyone else that causes me problems
If you dont want your name up here
Being singles out and busted on
Or worse.....
I suggest the shit stop.......

So I think Im just gonna leave y'all
With a good song to ponder


Bob Seager - Turn the page

On a long and lonesome highway
East of ohmaha
You can listen to the engines moan
And out Is one long song
You can thing about the women
Or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When your riding sixteen hours
And theres nothing much to do
And you dont feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Say here I am
On the road again
There I am
Up on the stage
Here I go
Playin star again
There I go
Turn the page

Well you walk Into a resturant
Strung eyed from the road
ANd you feel the eyes apon ya
As your shaking of the cold
You pretend It dosent bother ya
But ya just want to explode
Most time ya cant hear them talk
Other times you can
All the same old cliches
Is that a women or a man
And you always feel outnumbered
You dont dare make a stand

Here I am
On the road again
There I am
Up on the stage
Here I go
Playin star again
There I go
Turn the page

Out there In the spotlight
Your a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play
Later In the evening as you lay awake In bed
With the echoes from the amplifiers
Ringing In ya head
Smoke the days last cigarette
Remberin what she said

Ah here I am
On the road again
There I am
Up on the stage
Here I go
Playin star again
There I go
Turn the page

AH HERE I AM
ON THE ROAD AGAIN
There I am
UP ON THE STAGE
Here i go
PLAYIN STAR AGAIN
There I go
THERE I GO

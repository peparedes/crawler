Nearly a year since the last update, and, frankly, I'm amused by the fact this thing is still here. >_>

Uhm, I'm playin' DAoC and WoW now, both in about equal amounts. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand, err, it's Spring Quarter, at the end of week 2.  Right-o.  I should put this thing to some use, I suppose, but no idea what, really.

Anyway, thank you for flying, err, I'll be back at some point.  Time for some housecleaning around here, at the very least.

It's been an age.  I'm mostly updating because I'm waiting for the full file check version of DAoC's updater to finish running. >_>

Anyway, for lack a of a better body to my update, here's why I haven't updated in ages: No need and no desire.  I guess I'm not feelng voyeristic or something.  In fact the reason I'm updating now is because Kat randomly mentioned her journal so I decided to actually post something in mine.  Now that I think about it, I do suppose I've been considering redoing this thing for a few weeks now, maybe totally changing the format and locking off most of the old posts.  Why?  Because, well, I don't know.  I really don't update this at all in its current form, and I'm beginning to wonder if airing my mental laundry on the net is such a brilliant idea, actually. Before you say duh, shush up, I know I'm prone to flights of stupididdle.

On a more general topic, I'm doing DAoC again, that'd be Dark Age of Camelot for the unknowing, like I said above.  Now I'm on the Guinevere server.  Later, I'll probably post the names of my various toons just beause I can.  Oh, and I'm still a Hibby, duh.  Aside from that, I can't really think of much to say, so, bye for now.

----

""Imaginary""

Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

I linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming
Monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops
As they're falling tell a story

If you need to leave the world you live in
Lay your head down and stay awhile
Though you may not remember dreaming
Something waits for you breathe again

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

----

Night folks.

Life is weird sometimes. Talked for a long time last night with a friend I've only conversed with casually and briefly for like 13 months now, only it seems like we're still on great terms as far as she's concerned. O.o Weird.  It's nice, just not expected.  Then again, this week hasn't made a whole lot of sense.

Took my EVIL CIS 360 midterm on Monday, thought I freakin' bombed it, but I got a B instead.  Not what I wanted, mind you, but the curve just drop me in the midst of the A- range if it curves like the prof said it would, so I guess I really didn't fare that poorly after all.  Hooking up with my homework partner later today to ""throw down"" (his words, not mine) on our dbs homework. (Database Systems or even database is a pain to type, hence, dbs = Database Systems).  Right, anyway.  I'm just rambling, so you all go about your lives now.

I. Am. Happy.  Don't know why.  I feel relaxed for the first time this week, almost like I could just bubble away into a little pool on the floor.

Classes are going very well, I've got a nice and happy A in Italian going into the middle of the term, which makes me optimistic about the rest of the quarter.  AI is... I don't know.  I'll see if I can get some detailed information back from the professor this week.  Database is okay, as usual.  Midterm on Monday in that one, followed by my AI midterm on Tuesday.  I also have my 360 midterm on Monday, but that's the week after next instead of next week.  Italian has no midterm. ^,^

On a similar note, I schedule this coming week for Winter.. here's my best guess as to what I'm taking:

CIS 560M with Dr. Heym :: KILL ME NOW! This class is going to be bad.
CIS 459.21 :: C, whee.  Easy stuff.
ITAL 102 :: More of the same as this quarter, I hope.
Plus either CIS 541 (Numeric Systems) or STAT 427 (Stats I).

WHEE!

Anyway, I'm going to wander off and do some sleeping or something.

Not really sure what to make of the first one, other than it's vaguely amusing and underscores just how ambiguous the online word really is at times, hehe.  The second one is just giggles as far as I'm concerned.

I love weekends.  So little to do and so much time to do it in.  With any luck, I'll be able to have as much fun tomorrow as I did today, er, yestday. Heh.  It's still Saturday in my own little world, so nyeah.  Played more magic today, and I enjoyed it despite my very hefty loss ratio.  Be that as it may, I need to do more than magic after I get up, with homework -- especially my thrice-cursed AI homework -- and ""constructive things"" being high on that list.  I'd also like to work on my mod, but we'll see.

Anyway, nothing else is really new.  Only interesting thing today in the news (for me, at least), is this random little rant I ran into on Slate's Surpeme Court Dispatches, and it was filed a few days ago at that, hehe.  Here's the link to that site: <a href=""http://slate.msn.com/id/2089879/"">http://slate.msn.com/id/2089879/</a>. So, go forth and read, if you feel like some vaguely cynical and political amusement.  My favorite chunk from the article would have to be this:
//
Chief Justice Rehnquist asks why the 9th Circuit stressed the property-damage aspect of Banks' case. Roske starts to say that in Las Vegas ""we have a statute . . .""

The chief interrupts with: ""Well, we have a case, Ramirez, which the 9th Circuit didn't even cite!"" 
//

I don't think many of you will find that as funny as I did, but ah well.  I'm in no mood to explain it, so instead I'll leave you all to your designs.

Played Magic over the internet with a friend today. Night started out with 5 straight losses for me, hee.  He was killing me, so he let me get out my Blue deck.  That made things interesting.  I then proceeded to stomp him just as often as he stomped me, which is fun.  I'm putting my Blue deck back in its case, though, so I don't use/abuse it any more.  Building Green deck tomorrow to stomp on people with, hee.

Either way, it's fun to just screw around with a game like that sometimes.  I had more fun doing that than I had doing almost any other single thing this week. Mmm.

Anyway, I'm off to bed.

I just found out today that my progression I was using to plan my major classes won't work because they no longer offer 675.02 in the winter.  Sucks to be me, but ah well.  So goes life.  I'll work out a new one when I have some time.

Classes, on the other hand, are going decently.  Italian is a nice and healthy mid-range A after two tests and workbook collections and two written assignments.  Not too shabby.  Database is a mid-B, but that's with only one assignment, so who knows... AI is up in the air, because we've not got any grades back yet, heh.  360's first assignment didn't go too well, but I can easily compensate for that.  And C++ is still without any grades because it's P/F, hehe.  Gotta love those.

I stared work on my own little mod pack for Space Empires IV yesterday just because I could, despite SE V being due out in the next year or so, at least sayeth hearsay. That mod pack is going to take a bit more of a definite form today beause I'm going to start fleshing out the new tech tree based on my back story, hehe.  The backstory goes something like this: An indefinitely large number of eons ago, several large interstellar civilizations arose in prominence in the quadrants of our galaxy.  Seems generic enough so far? Right, well, anyway, as ancient empires seem to be wont to do, the ""precursor empires"" fell apart.  Fast forward to our time.  There are now many smaller, more stable civilizations evolving on the planets of our galaxy. Each one of these civilizations evolved on planets where the precursors once made their cities, and as a consequence, every modern species has a bit of precursor in them.  That's where the generic flavor of the mod ends and the fun begins.  There are currently four, maybe five, distinct ""flavors"" of prercursor, and each flavor has a unique name.  Each species gets to pick from one of the precursor bloodlines to be part of, but you can only be part of one, and there's a ""major"" and ""minor"" version of each package.  The ""minor"" version of the trait costs less, but it doesn't grant access to as much of the precursor technology, while the major costs almost all the points you have left after the minor, but you get a buncha neat stuff. ^,^  More details to emerge as I write them into the files.

Current Mod Version : .01 (not even close to being done)

I'm off to play with the files for the mod, so have fun peoples.

Until later."

Right about now is definitely one of those hide from everything and cuddle with Amelia moments.  Except, of course, there's no really good place to do that, because my room (the most private place in the house..) has the evil brain-stealing box in it.  Of course, the actual privacy doesn't matter as much as the state of ""people not being there"" sort of thing.  It's not that I'm in a naughty mood, just a very anti-social one.  There are perhaps half a dozen people whom I'd not mind being in the presence of right now.  Of course, Amelia and Rat are the only two within spitting distance, and Rat works until God-Knows-When tonight, and Amelia needs to get to bed, so that pretty much leaves me, myself, and my computer.  Ah well, that's life.

Classes are going well enough, I suppose.  My AI class has taken an amusing turn recently.  Something, which a few of my classmates and I suspect to be the disastrous homework 1, has caused the teacher to not assign code for Homework 3.  Fueling this suspicion is the fact that homework 1 hasn't been returned yet, heh, and the fact that no one we've talked to about it seems to have finished it.  Maybe we all bombed the jeebus out of it and she's giving up on the idea of code-based homeworks.  Maybe I'll get lucky and things will lighten up in that class a bit.  On a different note, all my other classes seem to be going very well, especially Italian and CIS 360.

Aside from class, the hunt for the job continues, and I need to do some emailing tonight to stay on top of the ball.  With any luck, maybe I'll actually be employed *gasp!* by the end of the quarter.  Only time will tell.

Until later."

So far today has been really good.  Woke up late, went shopping for food, got to see Amelia, and had alot of fun with a mid afternoon RP online. (Yeah, I'm a nerd.) Also did a little work for tomorrow's D20 Modern game.  Did no homework aside from a little CIS 630, so I'm pretty relaxed.  I most definitely dropped Linear Algebra yesterday, that class was the crowning pain in my hectic schedule, so out the window it went.

Right now, I have no clue what my CIS 630 grade it, but I do know that right now I have a nice, solid A in Italian, which feels nice, given the shafty history of my Japanese classes.  Nothing else really to report, grade-wise.  I have the same-ol-same-ol this week, nothing kinky.

Picked up a copy of Redenzous with Rama this last week, started reading it and loving it, even though this is my 2nd time through the book.

Hopefully tonight'll be as fun as today was.

After hunting down my TA for 630 (who doesn't know how to return phone calls, the bastard), I finally managed to find out that my project did indeed submit sucessfully, but I know that its so full of bugs that I'm probably gonna only get half credit for the last part of the homework, but thats still like 85 pts out of a 100, which isn't too shabby.  Still, it feels like I'm getting shafted a wee bit, but ah well.

I have so much to do, it really feels overwhelming at times, and the only way I'm going to fix it is by doing productive stuff instead of screwing off most of the day.  Maybe I just pick a regular walking time to clollect my thoughts, hrm..

First, will someone tell me why in the world they'd let someone so freakin' dense teach a 600 level class at a major university?  I mean, COME ON! The first homework wasn't too bad, aside frmo the very last question, which was IMPOSSIBLE.  I have never seen such horribly vague specs before in my life.  I mean, even in corporate environment, you'd at least know what the devil your bloody program was supposed to do! This program didn't even have basic specifications! It's intensely insane.  And, for those of you who are at OSU, DO NOT TAKE CIS 630 WITH BYRON! YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DO!


Furthermore, what is it with idiots these days? They seem to be everywhere, that they do.  I don't seem able to escape them regardless of what class I'm in.  One thing that's eluding me right now is how someone can fall asleep in the front row of a brightly lit classroom when the professor is constantly about three inches away from you at 1:30 in the afternoon.  Now, in a dark, warm classroom, or in an early morning class, or even in a class with no hope of passing (aheh, like my Japanese class @,@), but in a CIS-major only class, you'd figure the people there a) cared about computers and b) probably would be afternoon people like virtually every CIS person I know and not have any problem staying awake in that class, or if they did feel too sleepy to stay awake, they'd at least have the sense to not sit in the front row if they could avoid it!

Of course, I've probably been an idiot too at times, but that still annoyed the jeebus out of me, so I guess I'm an angry hypocrite.  Maybe this will give me motivation to never fall asleep in class again.

Moving right along, and in better news, all of my classes seem easy enough so far, aside from 630.  670 is cake, and so is 360.  Italian is an easy language compared to the horros that were Japanese last year, and Math is very easy so far. ^-^  I'm fairly optimistic, and I'm sure at least one other class will bear an unpleasant suprise to term before the quarter is over, but at least I can be delusional for the time being.

And, for anyone that is out there talking to me on AIM right now, yes I am insane.   Cutting it so close with an assignment does this to me.

I can't think of any other inane issue to rant about, so I think I'll snag a bite to eat, and then pass out with my usual lack of grace in my bed and sleep like a log for four or five hours before crawling out of bed for my 8:30 C++ class. @,@ I don't know if its going to be easy or not, but C++ is a pass fail class, so I'm not worried.

But, before I continue, I just want everyone to know that this isn't a last ditch attempt to sway opinions or dig up enough support to save what has died today.  If you felt that you enjoyed Mousekaroos at all, contact Sarah and tell her that, but spare any harsh words.  There is no more need for scathing half-compliments and pushy suggestions, and there never was a need for them to begin with. And now, onward I march.

Today one of my favorite webcomics decided to end abruptly.  The creator felt she was greatly under-appreciated and I really don't blame her for feeling that way.  I can imagine how hard it must be, with all the negativity that seems to populate the web these days.  There are far too many people willing to dish out criticisms and harsh and hateful words, and not nearly enough are willing to give kind words to any artist, even when kind words are needed or deserved.  I fault myself for not being open enough with my kind words when I should have been, but there is no way I can change the past.  Therefore, it is with a heavy heart that I would like to wish the Mousekaroos a very fond farewell.  Sarah, I wish you a very happy life and I hope your future endeavors meet with more success than this one did, and may your other dreams suffer kinder fates.  I know this post probably isn't helping you feel any better about what has come to past, but it is my hope that, maybe, with time, any small words of encouragement I can offer will be able to ease the pain, even if I am but a nameless face in the crowd.  As you move on with your life, just now that you did make some of us happy.  We may not have been a vocal majority, but there were those who liked your work and never had a problem with your dream the way you portrayed it.  Some of us will always remember Blue, even though we never spoke loudly enough to tell you while it mattered.   Thank you again for all the fun, and the interesting story you wove while it lasted.  Godspeed, and may the winds of fate blow ever at your back.

It's morning. Ugh.  If I have enough time to post in this, why am I not in bed you ask?  Well, I'm trying to get in the habit of getting up and doing stuff before class so I'm not as prone to sleeping through them, and part of that involves getting up early enough so I have time to do more than shower and run out the door.  Of course, I'd really like to get more sleep in the future, and the only real way I'm going to that is getting to bed earlier.  Heh.  We'll see if that actually happens.

Anyway, in a few I'm off to do some Japanese homework and scooting off to the actual class, and today I also have weekly CIS Closed Lab which is quickly looking to turn into an exercise in raw stupidity.  I mean, we normally do something at least mildly useful but this week all we do is match up stupid little buggy things in a program and see whose bugs eat the most face, or whatever.  Bleh, pointless as far as I'm concerned and the time could be better spent on one of our horrible later projects that will bury me alive the second half of this quarter.  Ah well.

And, because I feel like it, here is the weather I'll be scurrying about in this morning (joy):

Temp: 34 F 
Conditions: Fair 
UV Index: 1 Minimal 
Dew Point: 28 F 
Humidity: 79% 
Visibility: Unlimited  
Pressure: 29.91 inches and rising 
Wind: Variable at 3 mph 

Weather data is straight off the Weather Channel, heh.  And, yes, I know there is supposed to be a degree mark between the temperature and F, but if I put it in it gives lj's website a heartattack and you get little '?' in your journal entry, which annoys me.  Plus, the edit journal script flops about and dies, to boot.

Anyway, off I go for homework awaits doing.

Until later, have fun and don't freeze to death if you're also in this cold snap.  Some Spring this is feeling like right now.

<div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/realm/giegie/tmetroid.jpg"" border=""0""><br><br><font face=""arial"" size=""2"">Take the <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/realm/giegie/Metroidgameq.html"">""What Metroid Game Are You?""</a> quiz by <a href=""http://www.metroidgalaxy.cjb.net"">Metroid Galaxy.</a><br><br></font>
<!-- End Metroid Game Tag --> </div>

I just think it's funny.  Found the quiz on a Metoid series fansite and took it, got a chuckle out of the result.  The only other thing worth saying is that game was a blast, I should replay it yet again sometime soon.

Also, I redid my bios (a bit -- probably revise it further at a later date) and I also redid and added to my interests list, just for fun.  Thought the former was out of date and incomplete, although it still is incomplete, and I thought the later was just, well, I dunno, not me.  Added more details, noted a few of my favorite composers, etc.  I plan on changing my icon-thing away from the current smiling skeleton-king guy because while it was funny when I posted it, I just am slightly bothered by it now more than anything else.  Also I plan on maybe updating the format of this thing, but who knows.  Maybe change the colors around or something, or perhaps just toy with the way the text is set up, or maybe I'll just leave it once I change the icon.  I'm in a sort of revisionary mood at the moment, but we'll see how long I can make it last.

Meh, off to do things vaguely importantish. Have fun out there.

Until later, don't let the dragons bite.

Arc out."

Not in the most chipper of moods today.  Definitely going to pulverize the local xenophobe unless he keeps his yap shut.  I'm still annoyed that the twit complained about an eraser on his side of the room. ""Is this any of my stuff?"" <in his annoyed voice, as squeaky as it is...> AN ERASER! THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM, MAN? I'm so sorry one of my friends had the audacity to put the eraser down for all of three seconds on your side of the room Ryan. TWIT!

Ahem, anyway.  Other than that, there's not much to write about.  A migraine struck me down this morning, but it seems to have lifted mostly.  I missed a couple of quizzes, so I have some emailing and pleading to do.  Hopefully my Physics TA will accept my homework late, but if not, ah well.  There's plenty of points I can burn in that one corner, so I'll be fine.  Nothing really else to discuss about classes, really, except that I'll be spending several hours this afternoon doing major CIS stuff with Marc.  We need to get our buggie-program-thing ready for the contest for tomorrow.  No, the program isn't buggy like Windows, it simulates insects. ;p

Oh, random note.  Rat and myself were listening to another song from GiS: SAC and we were speculating which language it was in, and we decided it was in Russian. [Just try listening to the song without any prior knowledge other than this line, don't read ahead, and see how you do.  The lyrics are pretty weird and they don't sound like normal Russian either.]  And, well, it turned out we were right. ^o^ Funfun, and just a random neat feeling of being able to idenify languages by sound alone, and sung at that.  I mean, think about it, sung English often sends vastly different than spoken English.  I mean, let's say you got good at German while in High School, like I did.  Did you ever try listening to German music? If you did, you're probably nodding right about now as I say, ""The German you learned in class and the German in those songs we're anything alike, where they? Bruha."" So yeah, random neatness.

And, finally, another random funny / odd quiz I took that had results that I chuckled about and then decided to post.  Our flavor of the moment is a so-called ""Purity Test."" I think this result really shouldn't suprise anyone that knows me and that also looks at the test's questions:

<table cellpadding=""10"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""350"" style=""background-image: url(http://www.phyde.plus.com/matrix_paper.png); border-style: double; border-color: black; border-width: 3px; background-color: transparent; border: black double 3px;""><tr><td style=""text-align: center !important; font-family: courier new, courier, monospace !important ; font-size: 15px !important ; color: black ; background-color: transparent !important; font-weight: bold !important; padding-left: 40px !important; padding-right: 30px !important;"">I scored<br /><span style=""font-size: 30px;"">77&frac34;%</span><br />on the classic 400 Point Purity Test!</td></tr><tr><td style=""text-align: center !important; font-family: courier new, courier, monospace !important; font-size: 15px !important; color: black !important; background-color: transparent !important; font-weight: bold !important;  padding-left: 40px !important; padding-right: 30px !important;""><a href=""http://www.phyde.plus.com/purity400.html"" target=""_new"" style=""text-decoration: none !important; color: navy !important;"">Take the test here!</a></td></tr></table>

Anyway, there's not much else going on, so I'll let ya all go for now, maybe come back to yammer more later.

Until then, have fun.

First, yes, my choice of music is weird.  Yes, I know that piece of music was written for bands.  I still love the way it sounds. Bleh.  There's something neat about it, and it helps me calm down, which can be invaluable at times.  But moving right along.

Today was mildly unproductive, although I did get some stuff done, I didn't do nearly as much as I wanted to and I feel like I'm partially unprepared for tomorrow's Physics and Japanese quizzes, but oh well.  That's life I guess.  I am happy I managed to get my first of like ten logic assignments in on time, that made me pretty happy.  I also did get together briefly with Marc today to work on CIS, and that helped a bit too.  Other than that, though, I really didn't do anything.  No CIS due until Friday, and I've had my Phsyics homework done since Sunday, so the rest of this week looks decently sedate, but ya know.  Except the Japanese which isn't done yet, but I can cope with that, and it's just a quickie little thing from our JWL book anyway, so that's not a big issue.

Well, I can't think of anything sane to say right now, so you people out there have a good night's sleep.

Until later, good night.

I love feeling like this, slowly dropping down into the warm blanket of nothing but relaxed contemplation.

During a rambling discussion with a friendly fur on a MUCK I just joined last night, I ended up having a few suggestions musingly made for a new morph, and it seems like the idea has bloomed into something over night.  Right now I'm trying to move my fleeting thoughts and memories into a description.  I've already tried naming the species a few times, but I think I need to hunker down with a dictionary and turn my ideas into a meaningful name, maybe something drawn from real taxonomy.  That'd be neat.

Classes went well today, nothing major happened.  Japanese wasn't nearly as hard as I was worried it was going to be, but I probably should say that until I finally see my scores for the first few classes.  And, CIS was easy as usual.  Man, this either going to be a good quarter grade-wise, or come midterms, I'm dead.  Eh.  We'll see which one is actually true soon enough, I suppose.

And since I haven't mentioned the Iraq mess in this thing yet, here's my opinion: Blah.  Should've got him the first time.  Bit late to be doing it now.  And, for those of you I just offended, bleech to you.  Don't waste your time flaming me, because I don't care.  I'm not exactly peachy about the war, I just don't think waving my arms and screaming is going to accomplish anything at this point, since we may have actually killed good ol' Saddam if the media is to be trusted, which they're not, but hey.

And that is the last you'll hear about I-smack and the rest of the Middle East from me for a while.  I know its horribly apathetic of me, but right now priority one is classes, priority two is friends/family and priority three is fun.  What the violent fools are doing right now is some where down about priority six billion or so.

I think I'll go and get some food now, maybe I'll post the notes I generate on my new brain candy later, we'll see.  Even better, may I can condition myself to post regularly, that'd be a neat first.  Meh, with any luck.

But, for now, I'm off.

Until later, have fun.

Well, dram.  As soon as I get really comfortable on a MUCK, get a nice group of furs to hang with, and such, something seems to infallibly come along and totally wreck the balance of the system or come very close.  Well, *plllbbb* on that.  This time around a few furs and myself plan on fighting the coming disaster and we hope to keep our virtual home intact.  With any luck, and a bit of dedication, we should be fine, but who knows.  I have, however, suspended all of my work on RavenSpire, CAS, and Aulln until I know more about the probable outcome of this bit of troubled waters.  With any luck I'll have found a new temporary home for Aulln so I can work on it while the server-issue that's causing all of this gnashing of teeth to fix itself or be fixed.  I'm just making super-sure I don't lose my work this time around.  I've already created a nice and secured archival log of everything I own on any MU at this point, which should make future restores much easier.

Anyway, enough random bile from me, now for some nicer stuff, or at least some excuses.

I haven't been updating this thing regularly, despite any promises on my part to do so. <makes the random obsevation that he is using a prose-style like someone who does a webcomic's rant box or something.. Odd> Anyway, for those of you who know me from the MUCKs, and have somehow stumbled across this thing or been given a link to it, welcome.  I was going to say something more intelligent now, but, as usual, any vestiges of santity and coherence have long left my body.

Ah well, I'll post some more soon.  

Until later, goodnight.

Welcome back to my life, the little chaotic mess that it is.  As I record this, a friend of mine is spending her last night at home before she has to go to the hospital to under surgery -- to have her ovaries removed because they have tumors on them.  As this friend is also a fairly private kind of person, I'm going to withhold her handle out of respect for her.  All I can say is, Good luck and Godspeed.  We're going to miss you while you're gone, and we'll be waiting for you when you come back, with arms open.

Anyway, this has turned out to be a day to remember.  A very short while ago, I was half-asleep, and getting ready to punch out for the night.  And then I put on the song ""King Of Pain"" and suddenly I felt like I was staring in on the world from outside, and everything looked so crystal clear when I looked in.  The details are so sharp it hurts.  There's pain all over the place, and only barely enough happiness to cover some patches of it.  Lives are made and ruined in instants as the entire world spins around before my eyes.  I can't help but feel a bit stunned by it all, really.  Right now I feel like I'm drowning in all the details, and I can't even think of where to start.  Yet, at the same time, every little detail makes sense.  The contradictions are I think what confuses me the most, but life likes to do this to me, so I guess I should be used to it.

I don't think it's helping that my self-concept has essentially been unstable for about a month now.  Somewhere along the way, I think I forgot to keep track of who I am and right now I more than likely couldn't tell you who is really behind the keyboard right now.  Its this same foamy sea of chaos that came for me at Purdue, only this time I'm not going to let it drag me down.  I know I didn't work as hard this quarter as I should have, and I vow to not let this happen again next quarter.  I'm madder than all get out at myself for letting myself sink this far into the bubbly mess of apathy, but I can't dwell on it.  I need to move forward, and continue to look for who I am, why I'm here, and what the devil I'm supposed to do with my life.  I need to find out my destiny, as it were, so I can catch it before the train leaves me at the station.

The scary thing about that metaphor is that's the exact picture I have in my head right now.  I'm standing on the concrete platform of an old, open-sided brick train station.  The grass around the station and tracks is all dead save for a few patches, and big maple leaves blow across the area.  The tracks are all rusted, and the building is falling apart, and yet I just stand there and wait; I wait endlessly for the train which left long ago and never came back around.  I am more worried this will be close to the truth than I'd like to admit.  Kind of falling in with this is there have been days when I feel like my MUCK personas are becoming more of a person than I am.  There are days where I feel like I AM Arcanix, and that is both weird and scary, at the same time.  I just hope I won't get left behind by my online personalities as they evolve.

Moving on, I can't help but wonder if this weird crisis of self has anything to do with my weird hunches and dreams returning.  I've been without any deep,guiding hunches for about a year, and then in the last couple of months, they've come back.  I mean, I've had one or two since I left Purdue, but by and large, nothing.  It's sort of weird to be saying this, but I almost missed the feelings that something big was about to happen.  The dreams are also back.  I had one over the weekend.  I was so sure I was awake until my dog woke me up by kissing in the face.  I was flying, and I could feel the air under my wings.  The images are all gone, but if I think about it, I still know what they were, or at least I think I do.  That point of ambiguity has always bothered me to no end.  What's ever more weird is that people I know from the online world are in the dreams as their players.  That's always so unnerving, given that I don't know how a vast majority of them look!  I know its just my brain assigning imaginary faces to the names that float around in my memories, but sometimes just running into someone who you haven't talked to in years, even if its only in a dream, is just weird.  Marchhand, Phaedra, and Gish, if you read this, I still remember all of that stuff that happened seven years ago.  Alot of water has rushed under those bridges, and I doubt you even remember this crazy person, but I still think of you as friends.  Godspeed to you where you are.

I'm sorry if this has just rambled on in an incoherent pity party, but this journal is supposed to be a record of my thoughts and activities, I guess, so here you go.  A nice, clean, unadultered look inside my warped little world I call life.

Anyways, I need to get to bed, or I'll be screwed in the morning.  Maybe next time I post, I can manage something more cheery.  We'll see.

Goodnight folks, and I'll talk to you later.

I was listening to this song just as I was about to go to bed, and I can't get it out of my head.  Anyway, the song rocks.  I just felt like posting the lyrics, so you can all share in my strange euphoric moment, or something like that.

-- ""Subliminal"" They Might Be Giants --

As I went through the windshield, I noticed something

Subliminal (subliminal)
In an unnoticeable way
Important (important)
And hard to see

While lying there in my bed there was a message for me
As I went through the pillow, I noticed something

Subliminal (subliminal)

Subliminal (subliminal)
Subliminal (stare into the subliminal)

Anyway.  The lyrics aren't as cool as the song, but I hope that'll get you by until you too can get ahold of the song.

I really can't think of anything else sane to post tonight, so I'll be bidding you all a goodnight and sweet dreams.

Even though it might seem like it at times, I have yet to go spiraling off the edge of this earth, despite the fact that, at times, it sure feels like I have.  Thank god Winter Quarter is almost over.  At this rate, I might even be able to survive until the end of this batch of classes with a large chunk of my sanity intact.

But to briefly explain why I haven't so much as posted for a little over a month.  I do periodically come with things I want to post, but, honestly, recently I've been so busy that I just haven't had the time to go and type any of them up.  Also, I seem to have this nasty habit of remembering to try to post just in time for me to need to be in bed, and, sadly, I've been a good little student far too often recently.  Ah well, that had to end sometime, ne?

For those who care, my D&D campaign has decidedly degraded somewhat.  The group's dynamics are in a state of shambles, and I'm not going to be pointing fingers, because we're all to blame.  Several of the PCs simply do not get along, and the ""preferences"" for which type of RPing that is to be done have become varied enough that I'm having trouble doing anything coherent with the group.  Part of the problem is that I think I'm geared towards a strictly IC envirionment at this point, but I am not going to abandon those PCs that wish to keep the OOC levels where they are.  The one thing I am going to change immediately is how I prepare.  I'm going to try to switch to a fully-scripted system, as opposed to the more freestyle setup I've been using thus far.  I also plan on trying to be more serious and also to control the mood a bit more, as I feel I have been lacking in those departments to date.  I also really want to work on my NPC depth and variety, although I feel that my shortcomings in my recent NPCs have been in part due to the fact the party's personality as a sum can best be described as psychologically traumatizing, which isn't helping me try to develop NPCs via interaction with them.

In other D&D news, I have begun to form a second group, and I am planning on rearranging my players across two groups in order to stabilize things somewhat.  At the request of the current players of the 'first' group, I am going to finish the campaign before I reshuffle that group, but some PCs from that group may be offered a spot in number two before number one concludes, simply so I can get it started.  I don't want to exclude the rest of group one, its just that I also don't wan to punish the new people in group two simply because I cannot get the first group done fast enough.  The new group, aka group 2, is also going to be the one that is subject to the larger section of my scripting testing, and this is beause all the players there are so used to scripting that it seems unnatural for me to use my freeforms there.


I can't seem to think of many other things to say that are in the least bit coherent, so I'll post more later, when I think I'm better equipped to say something intelligent sounding.

Until then, goodnight all."

This entry is a few days behind schedule, only because I was SLAMMED last week.  That job was killing me royally.  Therefore, I quit.  I just can't carry 19 credit hours of sciences and juggle a job at the same time.  It's just too much and I can't handle all the extra stress.  Now that I'm free from that time-sink, I can try to catch up on my classes, and, hopefully, get another quarter's worth of decent grades.

Speaking of grades and whatnot, here's the low down on my classes, for those who care.

My Japanese class is more of the same.  We're learning yet more kana, and the memorization hasn't slowed down yet.  New TAs this quarter, and I'm not sure if I like them yet.  I miss Li-sensei, however.  He was hilarious, and I think that none of the current TAs are a substitute for him, except perhaps for Horn-sensei, who seems even more cool as a teacher than Li-sensei.  Only time will tell, though.  Other than that, we're almost done learning Katakana, which means that by like week 5 we'll be on Hiragana.  I'm kind of looking forward to that, as some of the katakana are confusingly similar.

My Physics class looks like it will be insulting simple.  We're only going to be up to gravity by the end of this quarter, which is making me wish I had taken Physics more seriously in high school.  If I had, I would have been able to take the AP or something and test out of this class and into something more interesting.  Oh well, I guess I'm reaping my just desserts, ne?  At least this class looks to be an easy A, which is worth it, I guess.

My Computer Science class is going to be boring and slightly difficult.  My professor isn't nearly as good as the one I had last quarter, for one thing. (Dr. Long! Come back! Your CIS 221 class needs you to save them in CIS 222!)  The new prof isn't as.. friendly as Dr. Long was, and he's not nearly as good at conveying examples.  The text is also much worse, and I really miss the nice exercises we did last quarter.  Now we're suppposed to ""just get it"", and that isn't doing as much for me as the constant practice we got last quarter.

Finally, my Classics class is going to be easy and very interesting.  The mythology we are studying isn't just the myths themselves, but how the myths relate to the culture that spawned them, the symbolism in the myths, and other such fascinating stuff.  The tests are biweekly, and look to be easy.  I have my first test in there this friday, so we'll see how is goes then.

Moving on from my classes to other things, like what the devil my title is supposed to mean.
For those of you who haven't guessed this yet, I'm totally obsessed with Master of Orion 3.  Sadly, this game isn't out yet, and QSI isn't being horribly forthcoming as to when it will actually be out.  Right now, the current guess is by the end of February, but noone other than QSI knows for sure.  With any luck, I'll have the game by my birthday, but then again, the game is already over a year late.  The title itself comes from the boards on MOO3's website, with ""The Harvest Begins on ... "" prefacing the due date that the person is predicting in their sig. on the forums.

Finally, on to the D&D side of things.

Late last quarter I kicked off a d20 Modern campaign, and it continued a little bit over break, and then, this past Saturday, we had our first Winter 2003 session here at OSU.  Here's a brief summary of everything that has happened so far:

First, the PCs find this old shred of paper that hints at great events to come, and decide to go to England, where they think this prophecy they've found is going to start.  They are interrupted enroute by a little mixup with the Canadian military and end up being recruited by an organization know as the Knights of the Silver Dragon.  From there, they go to England under the auspices of the organization, and from there they go north, to Glasgow, Scottland.  Once this ""Awakening"" begins, an island appeared off of the NW coast of Scottland, and the PCs went out to investiage.  Once on the island, the PCs hit a snag, and a series of ""doubel crosses"" almost go off, but they managed to resolve everything before anything bad happened.  Now, normally I would have liked to have finished the whole island in one, maybe two sessions, but alot of stupid stuff slowed the game down to the point it took like four or five sessions to finish it, which annoyed me greatly.  On Saturday, the PCs finally got off the island, so we can now move on with the plot.

And now for the rant:

Why must there be at least one person in every D&D group who can't handle the pressures of social interaction?  I'm not going to name any names, or give any other identifiers, but I will get this off my chest.  I don't understand why it's so hard to be NICE to the other people playing the game?  Why is all the antagonism necessary?  More importantly, why must some PCs pick USELESS concepts for their characters and then get mad when the DMs don't bend over backwards to accomodate their delusions?  This sort of lunacy drives me crazy!  Ah well, maybe in the end I'll finally be able to find a perfect group.  Right around the time when pigs fly.


At least I got that out of my system, as short and tame as that rant was.


I can't think of much else to say at this time, but I'll try to post again soon.  You all have a nice night out there. 

Talk to you later!"

Pardon the massive gap in the posts in this journal -- over Winter Break my modem decided to go the way of the dead.  As of right now, I've managed to pinpoint the error to the level that I know it involves hardware permins and the permins on the RCMS within in the Services menu.  Right now, the superadmin can't spawn the correct instance of svchost to allow a user to create a modem connection, and I'm probably going to try to get it working during this quarter.  Anyway, right now I'm in between classes and I'm going to post after I get off of work today.

Right then.  Before I get to the news, et al, here's a few random physics thoughts for those of you that are so inclined.  I was reading this thread on the Master Of Orion 3 forums, <a href=""http://www.ina-community.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=238761"">view it here</a>, and came up with a response that I thought was probably too far above the heads of those in the thread, so I decided to include my potential response here instead:

//BEGIN POST LIFT
  Please pardon if any of the below is wrong or very confusing.  This little thing is all coming from a comment about how you could plop a star in a pocket dimension to ""cloak"" it or somesuch.  What follows below is a vague transcipt / transformation-to-one-person post of a conversation I had with a friend over this thread and the conclusions we made.  Neither of us pretend to understand all of Relativity, et al, and what follows below is our best guess of what we envision.  And, yes, I am the scary kind of person that like to talk about this stuff.

  All of these gravity problems depend on whether you're looking at gravity from the particle standpoint or gravity-as-spacewarp standpoint.  If you look at it from the spacewarp angle, and you recall that matter is a form of energy (that is, matter and energy are interchangable in certain circumstances, but conversion between the two is still subject to entropic effects, et al) then wouldn't the residual feild in the system's former location generate a gravity flux? That is, wouldn't the initial jump to the alternate dimension cause all sorts of gravity-related weirdness on a local level?   More specifically, wouldn't the jump create a vaccum of sorts that will be ""filled"" by nearby energy, matter, or whatever.  The effective would be sort of like an black hole, except it would be raw nothingness sucking everything in instead of an extreme concentration of something. <<insert forum command for a smiley face here>> (This is of course, assuming the extremely large quanties of  ""energy,"" will, just like matter, generate spacewarp.)

  Assumptions for next segment:
--Pocket dimensions are finite in size, and that the pocket dimension in question is small enough to have the total sum of it's width and breadth and height contained in the ""infinitely vertical slope"" section of a sufficiently large black hole.

  Now, lets drop a system into this dimension and implode the star into a black hole of the correct size.  We now have a singularity with the dimensional boundry as the event horizon.

  Now, assume it would be possible to ""aim"" a dimensional portal such that it opens onto an area INSIDE the dimension rather than at its perimeter, thereby bypassing the actual event horizon (which would be the critical points at the edge of the vertical segment of the slope).  Now, if my mind is working correctly, the singularity should be ""naked,"" that is, without an event horizon (and violating the Law of Cosmic Censorship while it's at it!).  The gravity traversing the dimensional portal should cause a horizon to form almost instantaenously, but the horizon and all of its non-standard physics should have a chance to interact with the normal universe first.  Just wrap your mind around what a naked singularity would do to the universe, fun isn't it?  Me and a few of my friends all batted the concept around and decided the most immediate result would be that it would be possible to alter the rate of expsansion in the universe by controlling the portal aperature.

Anyway, I hope those of you who are in the US had a Happy Holiday over the last weekend!  I certainly did, and I was at home the whole weekend.  Needless to say, I didn't get around to posting, mainly due to my sister and I fighting for access to the connection as well as a general lack of anything good to post.  The one thing I did over break worth mentioning was I saw ""Treasure Planet"", which I enjoyed immensely.  I personally recommend seeing it, and I also recommend the original book, ""Treasure Island"" by Robert Louis Stevenson.  It's a nice, easy read -- especially compared to things like the assigned reading for some of my suitemate's classes.  Other than that, not alot has happened, really.

Later I plan on posting more about the ongoing d20 campaign, including a running summary of what has happened to date, as well as hints of what to come, but that will have to wait until after my math class, as I can't afford to be late to it today, it's our last review session before Wednesday's test and I really want to do good on this test!

Well, I can't think of anything else intelligent to post about, so I'll try to come back later and put more up.  Until then, have a nice day!"

Yes, this post is way late.  Suprised? I'm not.  Life is never nice like that.  Ah well, I'm surviving, which is what is important, ne?

Since I last posted, my D&D group had a smallish conflict, and life got interesting.

To make a long story short, we ended up shelving the campaign for the rest of the quarter and are running a d20 Modern ""filler"" until the quarter ends.  We haven't lost any players, but we did have tempers flare for a bit.  I think we've managed to resolve most of those conflicts now.  We are also shelving the Seal campaign so I can straighten out everything that's happened and retool the campaign thus far to something more to my taste -- right now we're having some OOC issues that aren't even funny, and I want to bring everything back under control on a campaign-wide scale before I continue.  I didn't want to pause it, but it was the only really good option I had.  Anyway, here's the scoop on my d20 Modern campaign:  The PCs are going to be running a dungeon crawl tomorrow as per the orders of their Patron, who wants them to figure out what exactly is in these ruins that were recently uncovered in northern Siberia.  Right now we have a Dedicated Hero, two Fast Heros, a Tough Hero (potentially), and either a Charimsatic Hero or a Smart Hero.  Whee.  This party will be fun to run, methinks.  I just hope I don't have too much turn over from PC death caused by traps.  This is the group's first real dungeon crawl, so I don't know what to expect from them and visa versa, so there's a chance a PC or two will succumb to the wiles of my traps and puzzles.  Only time will tell, and that time is tomorrow.  This'll be fun.

In other news, Wizards has finally hinted as to their release calander for next year:

There's this book coming out in February called ""Savage Species"" from what their preview article said, and it is set up to let PCs play monsters, complete with new items, Prestige classes, etc.  I'm looking forward to it indeed.  You see, I ran a similar campaign at one point in time, but it was alot of work on my part, since I had to do all the legwork in the book on my own back in 2nd Ed, and that was a massive drain, so the campaign never got as far as I wanted it to.  But that might change come February!  Speaking of games in general, I keep wondering when they're going to announce another d20 Modern book.  Having read the book at some detail by this point, I can't help but notice that it feels painfully incomplete.  The class progressions all cut out at about level 10, and the rules are just screaming for add-ons.  I mean, it's complete enough to run for some time, but there's an upper limit to how many different ""hero"" types you can take and how many advanced classes you can take, so I'm assuming there's going to be another book soon.  Yes, I know there's not a psychical limit, but how many classes would YOU take as a player?  Right.  I just hope they expand the campaign material they gave in the back of the book as full-fledged books in and of themselves, and I'd also like to see a Monster Book of some sort -- there's not enough beasties as it is, so I'm converting up from 3rd Ed.  Granted, there isn't much to do for conversion, since they're both d20, but there are things here and there.  I dunno, maybe they just planned on DMs drawing straight from other d20 materials to add on to the book, but I still think it would be a good idea to put out more material, if it's only rules extensions up throught the normal levels and maybe into the Modern equivilants of ""Epic"" classes.

In a totally different vein, Thanksgiving break is next week, so I don't think we'll be meeting then.  Also, this coming week has the 26th of November as its Tuesday.  For a while there, this coming Tuesday was the launch day for MOO3, but, sadly, release has been pushed back to 12-4-2002 as of the 19th of this month.  Ah well.  They're supposed to go gold on their build tomorrow though, which is good.  Here's to hoping!  Also on the topic of computer games, I'm going to offer up my two cents on Play The World.  I like it, but I am inclined to agree with the people that said it feels like an expensive patch.  There's not a whole lot of new material when you get down to it other than the new tribes, but I guess I can live with paying for it.  The thing is the AI for the new tribes seems better than the old AI, but that may just be an illusion of sorts.  Who knows? >shrugs< It is a good set of new stuff though -- there's not alot of it, but I like all of it quite well.  I think the new wonders are fun, and the descision to move the Wall Street wonder to the new Stock Market improvement in terms of prerequisites was a good chocie.  Funfun.  On a thrid computer tangent, what ever happened to Zork?  I'm assuming it got canceled at some point, since I haven't anything about it since Grand Inquisitor.  It's a shame really, the last three games (Nemesis, Return to Zork, and Grand Inquisitor, not in that order) were all good games.  Nemesis was nice and dark, and Inquisitor was downright hilarious.  Of course, RTZ was as campy as ever, which was also good.  I just liked the games so much, and I'm disappointed with Activision for not doing anything more with the series.  I went to their website and did a search for Zork and didn't get any hits, so I think I am correct in my sad assumption.  The world has lost another great line of games in the name of ""trends.""  Bleh I say!  Also, for you Earthbound fans out there, I've read rumors about EB coming to gameboy, but I need to dig around and make sure I have all my ducks in a row.

Anyway.  I'm really on a roll again tonight, jabbering away something fierce.  I've been thinking about it, and I saddly have been averaging about a post a week thus far, so I want to try to post more often.  Also, I've considered writing like a weekly rant or something on a free webpage, just because.  Actually, in all seriousness, it's because I've noticed I don't have trouble typing out alot of stuff once a week, so I think I could actually handle a colomn without too much trouble.  In fact, I think it'd be kinda neat and would help my writing skills stay sharp to boot.

Well, moving on, I have to go and get dinner and then get back to work.  I've got homework for tomorrow, and if there's going to be d20 Modern tomorrow, I've got to finish the dungeon too.  I've got alot cut out for myself to do tongiht, so I should get cracking.  On one last note: I do plan on posting some of my writing for my ""reader group"" sometime soon, possibly part of a story I've written or something.  I'm considering also posting the first segment of the story public too, so non-""readers"" can read it and decide if they want to be in the group that can see the rest of it.  I have no idea how many people actually read this, so we'll see what happens.

Either way, I'm on my way for now!

Have a nice night out there!  See you all later!"

I've decided that this journal seems to be my literary equivilent of catharsis, which is a good thing.

Now, speaking of catharsis, there's something else I want to jabber about.  Those of you who live with me and/or know me very very well are probably aware that I fancy myself something of a poet and or maybe a bit of a fantasy/sci-fi writer amateur.  Anyway, I've also been MUCKing for the last 7ish (nearly 8) years of my life, and in that time I've seen quite a few of my closer online friends go through the proverbial trip to hell and back.  I admit, I miss some of the ones that are now gone.  Coming to the point, I was fadiddling around with a couple of lines the other night and a poem came out, and I just felt like posting it and maybe getting some input, I dunno.  Oh, and I'm not going to disclose who the SNs in my dedication are.  They have privacy, and I feel bad for even posting their screen-names like this, but the poem wouldn't be complete without the people it is in (virtual) memory to.

""The Corner Of the Park""

For those I've met along the way,
for those who have gone, and for those who did stay,
you have tread with we upon a path,
a winding road through time.

Memories, like statues, stand eternal against the flow,
standing watch over palces where our psyches once dared to go,
You shall live forever more,
perched on the opposite shore
of the sea of time.

When life's long past, my soul shall arrive there,
in the Land of Dreams, upon that now distant shore,
where the sun ever shine in the sky.
Although you are gone, you did not die.
Your form and force long gone from our old haunts,
but the essence of your time there lives on.

Even though we now walk seperate ways,
and this will dissolve upon the waves
long before it reaches you,
know that you will never be forgotten.

The light of memory will burn forevermore,
while you wait upon the distant shore.
Though your fur is now long gone,
the essence of your form lives on.

--This poem is dedicated to Marchand, Phaedria, Apryll, Gish, Itico, Setsuko, Etana, Panterra, Lizzy, Ranna, Raven, Steve, Shade, Mink, Blob, and all my other firends inside the virtual realms I once and still frequent.  You people are all crazy, but in a good way.  Some of you are still around to read this, others of you I'll probably never get to talk to you again.  Life is just weird, but we'll all live on.  Godspeed on whatever road you may take.

Anyway, that poem is probably weird, especially for those of you who don't understand the very mercurial nature of the MUCKs.  They can be around for years and then suddenly start to shrivel up and die off.  It's really scary, especially when you have some of your own creative energy invested into some corner of the world that's dying, but it does happen.  The other vaguely creepy thing is that you can become close enough to some of these people, learning some of the weird shit that eachother has been through, only to have your only real form of communication cut off suddenly and never get to talk again.  This isn't as much of a problem for me now, but when I was in high school, especially my freshman year, I was the new kid in town and wasn't exactly Mr. Popularity (or Mr. Personality, for that matter), so I really didn't feel like I belonged in my school.  I felt out of place, but I've generally felt like I've belonged on the MUCKs that I've populated.  It's weird, you know?  It's hard to discern honestly over the internet, the depersonalizing nature of electronic communication makes it hard to verify what the other person is saying, which makes the importance of trust even greater.  I trust some of the people I've dealt with implicitly, while others I can't take their word for the value of the power that was used to print it to my screen.  I guess my point is that, as weird as it may be to some people, those friendships I formed online with kindred ""MUCKers"" were and still are very important to me and are a part of who I am.  I'm not going to deny that my life has been influenced by those people, and it'd be foolish of me to try to pretend that my time spent online was meaningless.

However, I'm am not going to attribute everything in my life to my MUCKing.  While MUCKs did serve as first real intro to programming beyond a basic level, and it sparked my already growing interest in role playing games, there are innumerable other factors that shape and guide who I am and what I am becoming every single day.  I did have some friends in high school, and I am still close to a good number of them.  Others, I've lost for stupid and trivial reasons -- sometimes the stupiditity was mine and sometimes it was theirs, but it was stupiditity all the same.  Something about a fool by any other name... (Yes, I do know that's not the line that Shakespeare wrote, but I felt like being creative.)  My real life world, which I now spend most of time in, is a very important part of my life as well (obviously).

I still feel very weird putting so much of this online for the world to read, but I think maybe if I do this some good will come of it, or maybe people I'm friends with will gain a better insight into what's going on in my head, as sometimes there are things that come out better in the written word rather than in the spoken word.  Life is just funny like that.

Now, onto other things!  I've got alot to do this afternoon before I can run my D&D session, but I can disclose what my itinery for the evening's session is starting to look like.

1-  The party will progress to the Cloud Drake island.  This objective will be met by the party unless we end after an hour or less from the start, which honestly won't be a problem somehow I think.
2-  Insert drugge work to find the location of the second seal here.  I estimate that this step should only take a few hours at most, but I could be wrong, especially if they get into too many combats or get too gutsy.
3-  Once they find the seal's location, they have to get to it.  This is where I am planning on spending the most time tonight, since it involves not only getting to the seal but to the control cylinder as well.
4-  If we get to it, the party may break the seal tonight.
5-  Post seal effects are the absolute farthest I will go tonight.  This step will only occur if they break the seal, and will end with the party resting either back at Burankara or at some citdael on the Cloud Drake island, depending on what happens during the drudge-work phase of the quest.

I estimate the whole quest for the second seal should be runnable in one evening, but we'll see.  The last seal took two meetings, but that is because we were slow to get started both times and we didn't play as long as I would have liked.  But, what shall be shall be.

Either way, I am going to sign off on this entry for now, since I need to do some work for the campaign BEFORE the players get here, so I can have ready that I need to run with tonight.  The more I can work out, the farther we go tonight.

One final note, I think I know how I'm going to handle writing posts from now on.  I'm going to post them at the custom security level, and only add the names of people who want to read my work to the list of ""permissible"" viewers.  This post will be public, and then from there, I'll work some things out for my players / readers who don't have lj accounts.  Anyway, everyone out there, have a good day!

First and foremost: for all of you who care, as of 3AM on the fifteenth of November, I will have been going out with my girlfriend, Amelia, for two straight years.  Whoa.  It's kind of weird, even parsing the idea is kind of strange to me, but, at the same time, it's also really really neat.  I'm so happy I'm with her, despite the problems that other people see in her.  Yes, she can be kinda prone to complain sometimes -- but then again, I challenge any of you to do what this girl has done and come out any more sane than her!  I doubt many people have the guts to essentially strike out on your own because your parents can't see the world from anything other than their own narrow point of view.  This isn't to say that her relationship with her folks has broken down completely -- because it hasn't.  But, on the other side of the coin, it's a fine line and, sadly, things could concievibly go bad if the wrong set of gears started to spin, as it were.  However, enough of that dirty laundry for the internet.  Seriously.  I'm just very happy I've been with Amelia as long as I have, and I look forward to the rest of our lives, God willing.  I wouldn't trade Amelia for anyone in the world.  Amelia, if you're reading this: I love you.

Now then, having finished with the important stuff, on to the rest of the insanity of the past few days.  Yes, I know and am well aware of the fact that it has been ten days or so since I lasted updated.  That's because life has been hectic, and I'm doing my best to keep my head above water.  I've finally got what I think will be my final schedule for next quarter, and here is my choice of poisons, er, classes:

Japanese 102.01 -- Yet more Japanese.  
Physics 131 -- Particles and Motion  
CIS/INF 222 -- RESOLVE/C++ with pointers, second course in the sequence
Classics 225 -- Greek mythology.

Yes, I am a junior by the way, but that's because of transfer credit.  >WARNING: HISTORY JABBER APPROACHING!<  I began waaaaaaaay back at Purdue, which, by the way, is where I met Amelia.  At Purdue, I was a chem major for one semester, and ran screaming after I got my first ""research"" experience -- I got on a r&d team that was Grad-level, and me gods, it was boring.  I also did some soul searching, and decided that lab work involving chemicals wasn't what I wanted to do with my life.  That's when I became a Comp Sci. major.  I spent one more semester at Purdue and then decided I needed to go and try to get my life in order before taking any more courses at a big college -- I just wasn't being responsible enough and I could have easily done damage to my future if I hadn't pulled out.  Needless to say, I think pulling out when I did was one of the wisest things I've ever done.  I spent the whole year after that (last year) taking classes at a community college near my home down.  By the way, don't diss community colleges.  Sinclair Community College, where I went, is a very fine school.  Yes, you can't complete a Bachelors there, but they have a setup where people who want to take some classes and then try their hands at a big University (or, like in my case, continue their education while collecting their lives and returning to a bigger school).  They have this thing called a ""Transfer Module"" which is a group of classes you can take and they have worked out transfer agreements for just about every school in Ohio, so you're sure your credit transfers.  Anyway, I didn't take any programming courses there, and when I got here, I had to start somewhere.  My programming course from Purdue didn't transfer.  Don't ask why.  I don't know and don't honestly ever want to find out.  So, if you know, DON'T TELL ME!  Moving along, by the time I got to OSU, I had already built up two years of credit, so here I am, a Junior, working on my pre-major classes.  Go me.  </History Jabber>

I'm just happy that tomorrow is Friday, which means it's~~~ GAMEDAY!  Yep, my D&D group meets tomorrow, so expect an update Saturday with all the gory details of the session, which I'm thinking is gonna last quite a while!  The last one we ran didn't end until the WEE hours of the next morning, like 3-4AM and it began at like 7PM, so that was alot of fun.  Anyway, since I know my players read this journal, no more details about tomorrow night shall be forthcoming until after the fact, just so my suprises stay just that.  Hehe.  Speaking of RPGs, I bought the d20 Modern book and am thoroughly pleased with it.  Now, the only other thing I want from Wizards this year is a publishing schedule for next year, so I know what's coming and can plan my budget accordingly.

Also on the gaming front, Master Of Orion 3 seems to be nearing completion based on the chatter on all the watcher sites, <a href=""http://www.orionsector.com"">www.orionsector.com</a> being one of my favorite, and I can't wait.  Except I promised to let my folks buy it for me for Christmas.  I guess this is a good thing though, since the release date is Nov. 26th, and finals occur in the second week of December or there-abouts.  If I got the game around then, my final grades would plummet, and that would be waste of all the hard work I've done so far this quarter.  Speaking of which, I think I got a 20/20 on my quiz today in Multivariable Calculus, a moral triumph in light of last week's disasterous test.  The class median on last week's test was a 52/100 -- not a good score at all, really.

Onto to other things!  I've still not had enough time to finish a full PTW game, mostly due to the INSANE amount of work coming from my classes.  I hate japanese homework, yet for some reason I really do like the class.  Weird.  I have played a bit of Secret Of Evermore this last week, and I'm remembering how much I enjoyed that game.  I really should replay it all the way through, and I think I could go for Seiken Densetsu III again too.  Oh, and if any of you corporate monkies want to whine about my playing a non-cart version of SD3 -- you dorks show me a place I can get a REASONABLY priced cart for the game THAT I CAN READ WITHOUT THREE MORE YEARS OF JAPANESE, and I'll be happy to buy it.  Heh.  Until then, kindly blame your own lack of intelligent business-choice-making abilites and quit complaining.  Since you never bothered to offer the game to American audiences, I honestly don't think you have a right to complain if people play the game.  Same thing goes for all the other great gamers that no company ""bothered"" to import -- it's your bloody fault, so don't complain about people pirating those games.  

Having thusly jabbered at you all something fierce, I think I'm going to bed now, since I'm pretty tired and I have class in like six hours.  Nightnight folks, and sleep well."

I spent most of last week getting a bunch of neat ""boons"" ready for the players and I was going to ""give out the goods"" today, as it were.  Fortunately, I had the good sense to use a few of the PCs to do a ""shakedown run"" with the number attached to the skeletal versions of the boons.  Heh.  Let's just say the boons have all been trashed for balanced issues.  Also fortunate is that the true nature of the boons still remains hidden from the PCs, so they only know what the skeleton might have been.  What fun.

This turn of events has, however, lead me to totally redo how I am going to be handling the main plot device for the campaign -- the five magical seals that form the ""foundation"" of the Empire that the Great Clans are part of.  I already worked out that the seals were each binding a great race under their baneful influence, but now I've got an excellent add on to that idea. ^^

Imagine a form of magic so powerful that only a select few people on the world can wield it, these few are called the ""Solai Uinar"" -- or the ""guiding suns"" if you prefer English.  This magic is so powerful that it attracts the attention of a number of malicious extra-planar mages who come to seal the magic before it floods out to the Planes and brings these extra-planar mages to their knees.  Now, imagine the mage's surprise when they cannot seal the magic entirely -- it is entirely too powerful to be contained even by their god-like powers.  Working desperately to try to hold this new magic beyond the eyes of any more potential ""Solai Uinar,"" the mages use powerful evil magic to warp the current Solai, and then they turn the five species which spawned the current Solai into horrible parodies of themselves.  Furthermore, they trap the magic itself inside five evil seals, using five forces of the world to try to dam up the flow of power.  They choose Nature, Magic, Evil, Elemental Energy, and the flow of Space and Time itself as the foci of the Seals and craft massive artifacts which are supposed to last until the end of time itself.  Now, to complete their evil, they turn to the newly cast-down peoples of the world and give to their leader these Seals, tricking him into believing that they, the mages, are gods and that these Seals are the basis for the providence of their civilization.  Take it from there.

Sorry if this isn't too coherent, by the way -- right now I'm half asleep from all my homework.  I'll try to clean this up later if any cleaning becomes visibly needed once I wake up. ~,~

Speaking of homework, I have another math test on Friday, this time it's mostly over double and triple integrals though.  I'm not that worried about it, but I'm going to study as much as I can.  Also, I think I really haven't been doing justice to my Japanese homework, and it's really beginning to hurt my grade.  So, tonight I spent a long time on the stuff, and I plan to do so again on the next few nights to help me catch back up.  Man, I never thought the class would be this difficult.  Guess they showed me, huh?  Ah well, that's life, no?

In other news, I SHOULD be getting my copy of Civilization III: Play the World tomorrow via the USPS.  We'll see if they can deliver my package on time.  If not, well, I won't be surprised.  Either way, and with any luck, I should be playing by the end of the week.  Wheeeeeeeee!!!

Anyway, I'm off to bed at this point, because I really haven't been getting enough sleep and I really need to get up on time for Japanese or my friends will keelhaul me mercilessly.  So, after I post this, I'm going to crawl off to bed and sleep like the drained dork that I am.  I just need to be clear-headed tomorrow not only for lecture and my math recitation, but also because I really need to get around to picking my classes for next quarter, given that my registration window opens on Friday and I still really don't have too much of a clue what I am going to be taking.  Fun.

Blah.  I'm going to stop jabbering fiercely and go to bed now.  One last thing though: I'd like to see if any of you can recognize my title, granted it might be slightly misquoted, but it still should spring to mind almost immediately.  Well, at least I hope so.  If not, I'll have to drop a hint or something, that is, if anyone even cares to guess. ^o^;;  Either way, that's it for tonight.

I just finished using up most of my afternoon to help a couple of friends out with their projects, and when I was doing so, I ran into the error message that is the title of this entry (minus the  -- WTF??? at the end, of course).  We never did figure out what it meant, but when we broke the output statement up more than it had been when the error was being thrown, the error went away.  This leads me to believe that the error in question was indeed caused by the OSstream getting swamped, but hey, who knows?  Even the ""consultants"" (read : grad students) in the lab didn't have the faintest clue as to why it was tossing that error.  Ah well.

In other news, as of right now I have the second highest grade in my CIS class -- pretty damn good considering I transferred in during the third week of classes and had to spend a week catching up -- more power to me!  Anyway, enough of the lauding of the grades.  Whee.

Sometimes I just can't think of anything intelligible to put down in here, so I'm just going to jabber about my D&D campaign I'm running for a little bit.

Right now I'm having each of my players run a solo quest before the next session -- since they've broken the first seal now, I can let their past catch up to them, as it were.  I'd love to be more lucid when I say that, but I know at least two of my players read this, so I can't really post all the gory details without giving away way too much info, but for those of you who read and aren't my players (are they any/many of you at all?) I'll post more details later, once the next few sessions have run their course.  It's so much fun being the DM though!  I love the ability to write the story and weave these worlds of fantasy to have my players navigate in -- I guess there was a reason I never enjoyed being a player much.

Anyway, I have to scoot to my multivariable calculus recitation now, so I'll try to post more later if I have time.  I do have a CIS midterm tomorrow, so we'll see.
Until then!"

"event","Well, today has certainly been very interesting for me.

First and foremost, today I finally managed to fix my girlfriend's computer, which has been fairly broken for about a year now.  The reason?  Well, to try to simplify greatly, it came down to some problems with the OS and with the FSB not liking the RAM that was in there.    Right, well, needless to say, the computer was being a great pain in the arse, as it were, and I'm really happy I finally managed to convince it to work again.

I also went to the local RPG-stuff store which happens to be named ""The Guard Tower"" and picked up a few DM essentials, namely a new set of dice and a matching bunch o' d6s, as well as a map and a new dice pouch.  I also went to another store, just to check it out, and ended up buying ""Way of the Samurai"" [Rokugan d20 setting] from this other store, which I shall refer to only as the dead pixie, since the store really wasn't one.  It's more like a fwe mostly empty bookshelves and a few tables.  It's just not very impressive at all, really.  Either way, I'm taking all of my business to the Guard Tower from here on in, mainly because their store is just great.

Moving right along.  Up until this point I haven't done nearly as much homework this weekend as I should have, but there's still a few hours left in the night with which to study.  Granted, it may not happen, but I can dream, right?

Jabbering right on, I've just noticed ljournal has a messanging feature.  One of the other lj users messaged me while I was out, and I haven't been able to figure out how to message her (? dunno if I have the gender right) back.  I think it's neat though, really.  Now if someone could message my roomie with a clue, everything would be great.  Seriously though, I wish my roommate here in the dorms was a wee bit more social in nature.  It's like he's some sort of zombie.  I used be under the illusion that his frequent outings were to visit people, but they're actually to do his insane amounts of homework -- he seems to do all of his homework at the library.  Sometimes I wonder why I even bought headphones to make sure I don't scare him with my music.  In fact, that's another thing that bugs me, we're on opposite ends of the music spectrum.  I'm sitting here, listening to all sorts of stuff, and he listens to country and soft rap almost exclusively.  This wouldn't be a problem if those two genres (country and rap) didn't bug me to death.  At this rate, I shall be plotting the untimely death of the TV in the room by the end of quarter, since all he freakin' watches on it is the County Music Television channel. 

I tried to run a second D&D session for this weekend today, but it fell through.  I think this is so mostly because it's such a drain on my time to run the things.  I love running them, I really do, but it's hard to do the sessions justice more than once a week because I need time to prepare as well as time for homework, sanity time, etc.  It's kind of funny, really, since most people play to relax.   While it's true that I relax when I'm DMing, it's also kind of taxing on me, since I'm essentially performing.  I mean, what else do you call creating a world whole-sale and then pretending to be everyone other than the PCs?  It's fun, but it's alot of work.  Still, I don't think I'd trade my gaming for almost anything.

Actually, I'm really really really happy with my curent group.  For once, I have a bunch of people that are really eager for the next session, and I'm really flattered by this.  I guess I'm used to my old group, which was 99% DMs all taking turns running, but even then my campaigns were still what we often ran.  I think maybe there's something about my style of writing, but who knows?  All I know is, my curent group is actually ready to play faster than I can write, which is something new to me.  It's so really nice to be appreciated, and to have my work called ""a real gem.""  It really flatters me, it does.  Thank you guys (and girl) for putting up with all the weirdness it's taken to get us this far.  What's even scarier is that we've run 16 hours worth of material this week.  A bit over 6 hours on this last Sunday's evening (Class?  What's that?)  and then another little over nine hours the following Friday.  That's alot of work, it really is.  It's fun though, which is why we're doing it.

Now for the other thing on my list of stuff, here's some quizzes I took:

First, I took this little ""what type of anime character are you"" quiz, and this is what I got:
<a href=""http://quizilla.com/users/mangacatgirl/quizzes/What%20Type%20Of%20Anime%20Character%20Are%20You%3F/""><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/M/mangacatgirl/1035252807_estvillian.JPG"" border=""0"" alt=""Villian""><br> <font size=""-1"">What Type Of Anime Character Are You?</font></a><BR> <font size=""-3"">brought to you by <a href=""http://quizilla.com"">Quizilla</a></font>

This is funny as far as I'm concerned, since that's what I normally play in D&D anyway.  I mean, who else is going to run the badguys?  The party's wizard?  Yeah right!  Fun fun fun.

The next quiz I did today was this little ""Which Final Fantasy VI character are you?"" and I got this answer:

<a href=""http://quizilla.com/users/Flickums/quizzes/What%20Final%20Fantasy%20VI%20Character%20Are%20You%3F/""><img src=""http://quizilla.com/user_images/1033519441_efkaresult.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""""><br> <font size=""-1"">What Final Fantasy VI Character Are You?</font></a><BR> <font size=""-3"">brought to you by <a href=""http://quizilla.com"">Quizilla</a></font>

Again, no big suprise.  I've already concluded that as a DM, I usually play the villain, so it's fairly accurate of these quizzes to ""paint"" me as one who tends to play such a character.

Eh, who knows?

Anyway, the random bit of odd humor aside, I think I'll let all of you get back to your regularly schedules lives, which means I'll be shutting up now.

Have a nice time people!  I might post later, once I get some serious homework done, but for now, have a good night!"

"event","Hello out there.

Right, so this is my first journal entry.

Today was a pretty good day, but a bit on the short side.  That's probably because I slept till almost 1PM.  Heehee.  I guess that's what happens when I stay up until 3AM the previous night partaking of nine consecutive hours of Dungeons and Dragons.  Ah well, I suppose I could have done less productive things, like surfed the net all day. (No offense to all you net-heads out there, it's just not very productive when I do it.)  I really need to do more of prep work ahead of time, but with this group I'm not very sure what's going to be happening at any given plot point, mainly because the group, as a whole, behaves like they're loonier than a drunk bunch of frat boys.

I really should be in bed right now, so I can drag my lazy butt up tomorrow to work on my homework.  You see, my Japanese class generates 2 or more hours of homework an evening, and that's nothing short of brutal.  Then there's my CIS homework I SHOULD do (heh) and my math homework -- then again, right now we're just doing double integrals, which isn't really too hard.  At least it's not more stupid random stuff my professor is pulling out of his rear (this has been a serious problem in the past).

Moving on in a totally random direction, I've been trying to get a code for one of these journals for a while now.  However, I decided, after much thought (read: none) that the looking wasn't worth it so I just coughed up the cash and bought an account.  $25 a year isn't really bad when you think about it, and I KNOW I blow more than that on any given D&D book.  Speaking of D&D books, I can't wait for d20 modern to come out -- it's always fun to get to play with new material, you know?

Ah, now let's see here, anything relevant on the meat-space side of the glowing wall?  Well, we won our football game tonight, 13-7.  Considering it was against Penn State, that's really not too bad, although I'm sure we would have gotten creamed if it had been an away game for us.  Ah well, fate can be fickle sometimes.

Anyway, I can't think of anything else particularly interesting to say at the moment, but maybe I'll come back later when I'm even more sleeply and even less coherent (and my spelling's even worse!) and try to say some more, but more likely than not I'll just post again tomorrow.

And, while I'm at it, here's a link to one of my favorite web comics: <a href=""http://www.machall.com"">Mac Hall</a>.  Go ahead, read it.  It'll be good for you.

Either way, good night folks.  Have fun out there in cyber-space or where ever else you choose to dwell."

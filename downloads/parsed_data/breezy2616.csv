"event","<P>hello people! i tryed to type this thing 3 times! I lost power the 1st time then i was typing to loud and it was like 1 in the morning and then it wouldnt go threw. I swear the lj site hates me but ill try again. Ok well i had such an awesome night last night but yet a really bad one...it made me think though Alot!. </P>
<P>here it goes.... Ok well the good part is me and sam had this long talk about how we used not to be friends and so on i think you all know the story. And we kinda relized its so lame to be fighting over or even if we were fighting i dont even&nbsp; now it was about and i bet she has no clue either lol. But we both thought it was lame not being friends and we were both at fault for saying gay stuff about eachother. Im glad it was all over with cuz it was getting old...<FONT color=#ff6666> i mean i know some people dont like her and some people dont like me but its not there bussiness who im friends with i know people are gonna say crap now that were friends but i can be friends with whoever i want. Ive known her for a long time and i kinda missed having her as my friend i think the whole thing was we kinda got carried away with it all and stuff. But like i said you just cant throw a fiendship and memories away like that in a snap so im glad me and her are all cool again.</FONT> Now the bad thing that happened. Well Chad called me last night and it was so good to hear his voice and talk to him. Mike was over there to btw he sounds really hot&nbsp; thought it was doug! hehe anyways he was just really sad and down in the dumps chad. Cuz he lives in the middle of no where i thought i lived in the sticks please hobe soundis nothing campared to jim thrope pensulviana dont get me wrong its awesome to hang in the summer but not to live! All there is there is pot heads and pervert guys or hick girls. I swear its like the pizzles man they have nothing but woods and pot. Chad is like he doesnt fit in there he is like a surfer guy and hes sooo sweet and good looking hes just a sweetie. I would like let him live with me if i could lol. He hates it he really wants to see me in the winter and summer. We met last summer and since then we kept in contact and he loves me. He doesnt have anyone only mike...and me. but what can i do im in fl? i guess i can just be there for him as a friend anytime he needs me. Your probly thinking ok this kid just lives in jim thrope pa whats the deal. Well he would be lucky if he lived in philly atleast there is things going on but thats not why im writing all this. Chad told me how <FONT color=#33ccff>his mom is preguante with this guys tommy baby and they are getting together and moving in with eachother.</FONT> Now chad is only 14 and Let me tell you a little something about tommy. <FONT color=#66ff99>Tommy is this crazy eyed pathetic jerk that abuses his mom throws her down stairs spits at her hits her everything and abuses chad. Its sad enough she has to settle for this jerkface as her babys dad</FONT> but for her other children to get hurt. He has no one if he lived in ny or fl or anywhere else at least he has someone at school or a friend to go to but you dont know how it is there. Its not just tommy who abuses them but his brother who is 8 or 9 does in a way. Listen. <FONT color=#ffcc66>Me and lena were at the pool up there and we met chad there and i saw these big gashes and cuts on his ankle that wasnt there the other day. I said ""What happened?"" Chad said kinda quietly but laughing it out nervously "" my brother burned me while i was sleeping. he does stuff like this all the time. he doesnt get in trouble though im the one who always does"" i was speachless i mean how could you do that to anyone let alone your brother</FONT>. I could understand if i was so mad at someone but i couldnt even think about burning them! The cuts were all scabed and blistered and bleeding i felt soo bad i just wanted to hug chad and take him home with me. I swear when i met him he is just so sweet you fall inlove with him. <FONT color=#cc33cc>Ok now im starting to really sound like a bible or church girl but im just relizing that we take for granted everyday what we have. You may think you have it so bad but others have it so much worser. Sometimes you dont relize that we have it so good. That really hit me today and i relized that. It made me think alot. Just keep chad in your prays he needs it about now.</FONT> Another thing taylor was right he said this guy predicted a couple of years ago that in 2004 there was gonna be 5 major hurricanes ot hit FL and jean is the 5th one....scary or what. Well im gonna go to much drama for me<FONT color=#00cccc>. I LOVE YOU GUYS!</FONT>&nbsp; chow babes x0x BrIe</P>"

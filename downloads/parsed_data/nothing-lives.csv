Where they make us grow 
And I'm frightened by 
The liquid engineers 
<strike>Like you</strike>. 

My Mallory heart 
Is sure to fail 
I could crawl around the floor 
Just like I'm real 
<strike>Like you</strike>. 

The sound of <b>metal</b> 
I want to be you 
I should learn to be a man 
<strike><i>Like you</i></strike>. 

Plug me in 
And turn me on 
Oh everything is moving. 

<u>I need my treatment</u>
It's tomorrow they send me 
Singing 'I am an American'. 
Do you? 

Picture this 
If I could make the change 
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall 
Did you? 

And who are you 
And how can I try 
Here inside I like metal 
Don't you 

All I know 
Is no-one dies

"event","Hello.
Today I went into town with Scott, Nick, Anna, Shona, Lois and Joanna, we went to see Thunderbirds which was OK.
Then we went home for a bit and then went up to Joanna's, Nick didnt come though cos he had a migrane or something similar, <strike><small>depression</small></strike>
At Joanna's we watched Monty Python - The Meaning of Life, which was pretty good.  Then I came home and I've just been sitting about ever since.

Thats all for now
Bye."

"event","Hello.
Well yesterday was interesting.  I went to meet Max at kelvingrove park which took ages as I completely forgot the way, we then went up for Roisin, and then walked up to some shop on Dunbarton Road and bought vodka, and then we met <strike>Coleenxcore</strike> and bought robinsons to mix the vodka with, how hardcore are we?  We then sat and consumed it in the Botanical Gardens, it, as per usual (or so im told) went straight to coleens head, and it was funny watching her struggle to walk, we went to some cafe so they could go to the toilet, and had a conversation with the chef, or deliveryman who was also there, before walking up to kelvingrove again to sit about, we bumped in to some people who were skating, who Roisin and Coleen knew ( ? ) but then we bumped into Andy Clark, who is a complete dick, thinks hes so hard.
We then wandered about again, and Max had to go home, so we sat about for a while, then headed back up to Great Western Road, where we bumped into 3 bams, who kind of mugged me for 2 pounds lol (obviously scaffs).
Then I decided to go home.
More probably happened but I was slightly drunk so dont remember some of it.

Thats all for now
Laters

A smile more yellow than the sky.
I've got a song stuck in my head.
One that I miss more than my bed.
It's a song sung from a fallen milkman who's drinking bleach instead.
I'm much like him.
<font color=#E8C12D><u>14 Hours Unfed</u></font> - I spent the last cents in my head.
They're worth much less than pennies now.
Food for one thought shared with a crowd.
And I've got a painting in my head.
A deeper blue bled thicker red.
More Red than Bloody Marys coast to coast.
I hate flying I said - That's what I said.
<font color=#E8C12D><u>Sad Sorry Excuse</u></font>
Just like everything that made her smile and everything I use.
I won't go back to the way it was.

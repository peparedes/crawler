"event","Well, Erin, Paul and Jeremy just left my house and i went to go with paul and i called my mom and told her i was going with paul for a little bit and that i'd be home before Midnight. By the time she replied I was at the bottom of the street and she made me walk home and when I got home she said. You have to ask first. Yup, shes a bitch and I hate her guts sometimes. Erin's gone for a week and I am going to miss her so much. Hopefully I will have fun this week without my mother interferring."

The first time I got grounded I deserved it but this time I didnt at all. Anyways, It got really violent today and my mother starts pounding on my face. I didnt know what to do so I just stood there and took it. I don't know whats going to happen after this incident but things will never be the same. I lost almost all respect for my mother after this happened. Sure, go and blame it on the time of the month. It's a poor excuse. You shouldnt pound on your son's face if you love him. Just goes to show you how people really feel about you. If I were old enough, I would be out of this house but until then all I can say is I'm sorry about my mother Erin, I wish I could actually see you. Sorry to my friends, I feel like i'm falling away from all of you because of all of this. Please don't let that happen, You guys were always there for me, and I love you for it..."

All was lost but not forgot, the pain controls my every thought
A new day's battle has begun, all was lost and nothing's won
I can't wait to see the day, when the tears all go away....
I miss you, I kissed you, when we layed you in your grave
I need you to believe you, things were meant to be this way...
Today came with shattered dreams, everything's not what it seems
Don't think death won't come get you, cause it will life's misconstrued
Though my battle's just begun, I'm dropping arms and going to run
I can't wait to see the day, when the tears all go away....
I did nothing at all, it's all my fault your gone
Your face on my wall, it tells it all, you will live on...

This is the deal... FS's P.a. was stolen at the february 25th show. We didnt notice til about a week ago when we went to practice and our p.a. wasnt there. That's when we realized that the last place it was, was the Milan. Everyone had cleaned up afterwards and nobody saw it. I didnt even know it was there, Nobody told me they brought it.

On a side note...

I love Jaimie more than you!
It's been almost two months and I have nothing to complain about.

I thought they wote new songs. Well if they did I couldnt tell the difference from the old ones. Get some fucking variety!!! No offense to Dan or Scully, their awesome.

We started talking and two i think 10 year old kids pull us away from the crowd, and asked us if we were cutting down trees. Ryan says that If i don't know what your talking about i walk away.

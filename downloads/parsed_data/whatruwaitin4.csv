i have no drama in my life.
I just had the best spring break ever. 
Imagine 9 girls going on a trip together.
You would think drama but we didnt have any problems.
I cant name all the hilarous things that happened.
This trip was a reminder just how awesome my friends are and
how truly lucky i am to have found this group.
Throughout all of the shitty things that have been thrown
at us this year we have gotten through it together.
i dont mean to sound conceded or a Kno-It-All
but i really cant think of this big of a group of girls that 
know as much or are as close as we are.
I just cant believe all the times this year that i have been
upset or worried about boys.
key word... boys.
who gives a fuck.
i have friends
what more do i need.
nothing

ive really been trying to make a effort to be nicer.
its hard granted when i always run my mouth and speak before
i think but im really trying. its going to be awkward to see
the ex boyfriends from prom but ill be with my friends and hopefully
i can ignore them and have the best night i can
thank you girls for everything"

i had an epiphany tonight
i dont want to go to ULL
its too big
to far away
like none of my friends are going
too much of a party school

idk the goods outweight the bads
what does ULL have?
yes i mean it would be good to get away
and finally fend for myself
but ill meet new people where ever i go
im just not ready for that big of a jump
i can go to southeastern if i feel im ready to move
on i will
i think im pretty set in this decision
yes i was in the ULL
but things have changed"

the friends thing was working out
god why do i have to be such a old fashioned girl
its like if a boy doesnt talk to me i wont talk to him
i hate it
i hate that we can become so close but then i become this jealous bitch
i just want to be able to hangout with no problems
and it just be awesome like it always is when we are alone or when we talk
why cant i just accept that im not going to have ur attention 247






And if that boy drove through the night to see me its got to me he likes me somewhat right?

One to go.
Funeral tomorrow.
Its going to be the worst day so far i think.
Seeing Tyler laying down not smiling, not jumping around
like his usually ADHD self was so hard to take. 
Whats even harder is that Austin, who im really not that close to
gave me this huge hug and told me that Katee needed me and to
take care of her and to be strong.
Im so glad that we have a huge support system... like all the girls
so its not like its all up to me to help katee. We are all there.
And i think she knows that she can call anyone of us.
I know that i feel like its my job to bare the burden of it all.
But i cant blame myself.
I know deep down it wasnt me and Katees fault. Tyler wasnt
meant to come to Lafayette with us.
I hope Katee knows that too.  She does.
I hope that we can bring her comfort because theres such
a long way to go for her to heal.
To think its only been 2 full days since.... it.
seems like its been a lifetime.
For a moment we will all be laughin like old times
but them we remember why we are together.
And then we will laugh about Tyler and all the silly things he did.
He did many of them.
I hope we can one day just talk about him without crying."

Like this talking this is so different from what its normally like.
For instance i hate talking on the phone.
But with him we will talk for like 3 hours and i wont even seem like it.  THREE hours people.  Thats something i have never done.
Idk. I mean its not like we have everything in common. We are pretty
different. But i just dont know. It just feels right. Its not like
oh i want to get in his pants or all i want to do is kiss him.
Its just like. I want to talk to him. I want to know what he thinks on everything. I cant explain it.

"event","Im in such an unexplainable state right now.
Its one thats kind of content, thankful, and relaxed. But those words realy dont completely
describe it either.  Its amazing how something i thought would be so drama filled would help
me so much. I just feel that i bonded with so many different people.  Even my friends that i couldnt
learn anything new about i did.  I really wish everyone could have gotten as much out of retreat
as i did.  Im not sure if i got closer to God on this retreat but i got closer to everyone
and learned alot about myself so i guess that is Godlike?? I apologized to some people that i really
owed an apology to and you know they accepted them without hesitation.  Its so amazing to me.
I have so much respect for these people because i know that i dont deserve their acceptance and their
understanding but they have given it to me without any questions.  It makes me feel so bad that i hold
grudges against people. I know now that i honestly do.  Im trying to work on it.  I fixed two of them
that i had this weekend and it feels like so much weight has been lifted off me.  I know that theres alot
of people that i want to talk to so i can get closure on some things but i know i cant.  But just
knowing that the people i AM able to work things out with have accepted me in just unreal.
Im going to take this as a lesson in that if they can forgive me i can forgive others.
I really hope that i can keep this state of mind and that it wasnt just the retreat atomsphere."

Everywhere.
I never knew it was possible to feel this bad.  I havent eaten in 3
days.  I no longer know what its like to consume food.  Spirte has become my only
source of nutrition.  The bathroom has become my best friend and where i spend most of my time.
Honestly, why does God hate me? This whole sick thing is starting to become ridiculous.
It bothers me cause my friends are like why are you never at school and you never do anything anymore
and it really just hurts my feelings.  Its like people think i honestly like missing school. i would
give anything to just have 3 or 4 weeks go by where i dont get a miagraine, fever, or throwup.
I have NEVER had fever before but now its like a familiar place since i have gotten in so much lately.
i dont know whats wrong with me.  I dont have anemia and they said my blood pressure is low.
But what does that exactly mean? They are like drink more things with salt? Wow thanks
its like seriously you people have spent YEARS in medical school and ur tryng to tell me that
theres nothing you can do? Honestly its getting a little old.  Why cant they just prescribe me
every medicene known to man with a list of symptons so if i feel it i can take it.  Ive gone to the doctor
twice in the past 2 weeks.  We spend so much money on all the drugs i have to take.  I feel so bad
but theres NOTHING i can do about it.  I feel so out of contact with the rest of the world.

yay for making new ones and new memories
I may not like any boys right now.  Like seriously none.  I am the most
boy crazy person you will meet but for now all thats on my mind is the fun
times that im having with the girls the last year of highschool.  Its really sad
and i was thinking that after this year things might be different.  Like i know in college
things change, people change, and grow apart but why cant we all stay in touch? It sucks
because its taken me sooo long to finally find a group where i feel myself and fit in and now
it just a little less than a year we will all be in different places.  Not all of us.  But im
definately going to be seperated because NO ONE is going to ULL.  I really dont know what im going to
do.  Its a scary thought being on my own with no one with me.  Like today what started off
as a hello email became this 7535845 email extravaganza complete with pictures of boys and
girls that i hope my friends dont become attached too.  It was hilarous and all of us laughed
in our class periods.  I want that next year. :("

Like seriously
i dont know about everyone else but usually Catholic dances tend
to bite.  I really havent been to any since freshman year.
I had a feeling this would be a good one just because we got to dress up
and we are seniors and so we have the right to act totally stupid.
Im so glad that we all went together because the more people made it fun.
There wasnt much of a football game but i did catch a pass lol.
Then there was the surprise attack. I have to say Seniors yall handled
it awesome even I was taken offguard.  Everyone was soaked but it
was time for the slip in slide. Im so freaking excited about the pictures lol.
We took some good group pictures like us all wet and soapy, everyone before at Canes,
everyone at Mallorys, the backs of our shirts, ect. ect.
Then there was Chubby bunny.  Katee put 13 in her mouth, thats extrodinary.
Im kinda of scared to see those pictures, the ones of people spitting out white stuff....
I liked when we all went in that guess room and we sat and talked. It was kind of rowdy
because soooooo many people in one room all wanting to talk. I think for the most part
we kept it under control??? Im glad that i got to learn all the other freshmans names.
We really have a great group of them.  We have some that are quiet but they all pretty
much participated in everything.  I hope that they had a good time cause i had a BLAST. 
I just want to say through all teh drama you can have with a BIG group of girls i want yall
to know that i love and appreciate everyone of you and im so thankful to have such a
diverse and fun group of girls.  I couldnt ask for better friends.  Im so happy this
year because i feel that i am getting closer to the girls in our big group that i didnt
know well. I dont mean to get all feeling and blah like.  Its just someone mentioned 
you know its the last time we have a back
to school dance and its really sad.  I think the whole senioritis thing they are talking about
is kicking in."

for us in the future but i know for now that it wouldnt work because he needs to be single

She told me about it and i went in and helped her say all this shit back to him.
You can tell hes this little pussy because all he could say is the same
thing he had always said
like she had small boobs
she had cankles
he dumped her
and she was annoying

he dumped her because she doesnt have the nerve to dump guys she has small
boobs cause shes sooooooooooo skinny and he always called her and still does.
she doesnt have cankles!

he was following a friend down this road and his friend was on the phone and driving slow
so Garrett went to pass him up and hit some loose gravel so his car hit something thank
God on the passenger side or he would have been killed and his car kept spinning and spinning
and his friend ended up hitting garrett so he started spinning and my mom said somehow they
both ended up with them and their cars in the wide open field and Garrett was ok
so he got out and started screaming for trent and was crying thinking he had killed his friend
i cant even imagine what was going on in his mind
Trent was calling his name too but it was dark so it took them a couple of minutes to find each other
i know that this has scared his shitless

i met this totally awesome guy in tally.
hes really funny, cute, tall, nice
and he sings and plays the guitar extremely well.
he was talking about how if u like a guy or think hes cute
tell him because there was some girl he liked and she didnt tell
him she did till recently and he said that he prolly would have dated her.
so we were online and i was talkin to him and i told him that hes 
by far the cutest and nicest guy i met so for and he was
so shy about it lol.  its cute because i think that he doesnt think hes cute
and me saying that made him blush totally!!!

i know that i must like him because i say the most stupid things in front of 
him and i always embarass myself.  usually im the first person to get things but with him im just an idiot. joelle fisher and jbbj noticed and asked why i get so flustered with him around and i was like idk its really strange.
i havent gotten that way around a guy in a lonnnnnnnnnnnnng time...

me and joelle fisher were at home and i was talking to him about how we
wanted to go eat and he volunteered and took us around to get something.
how sweet is that?
he came and picked us up and he so listens to the same music as me which
is totally kool and he can play them all and he sings really well.
joelle was like ""  i have to sit in the front because i cant sit in the back if not id let u sit in the front because u think clay is cute and u like him""  RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM... he gets beet red and its soooooooooo precious!
he was like sooo embarassed! i was like yes clay ur totally sexy.
he just looks at me and smiles shyly.......

gosh i hate when u meet kool people and u know that soon u wont be able
to see them because of distance.  Id really like to get to know him better
and i will but i wont get to see him.

"event","Well last night joelle fisher had a dream about me.
She said that i won a radio contest and i got to have
my own photo shoot.  But she said that it wasnt a normal like
photoshoot because they painted tatoos all over my body and i wore
this ugly red shirt that had a yellow smiley face on it.
She said that i was TOTALLY into it making all these weird faces.
She said i worked the shirt and all the tatoos that covered my body.
I know that people say dreams mean something but...
what in the world could this be possibly telling me???"

"event","Ive been talking to alot of people that have affected my past 
lately.  I was talking to my cousin whom i havent seen in forever
and he was telling me how we havent hungout and how everyone
had been asking about me since they hadnt seen me since football season.
I told him ive just been real busy but every so often he would put
into the convo "" We need to get together"" or "" We need to catch up"" 
or "" cant wait to see u tommorrow at the game"" 
It makes me feel so guilty for not going visit.
Its like i dont have enough time to do what i want
Theres to many things to do, to many activites, to many people to see.
And the thing is that most of my SMSH friends are Seniors so its like
ive missed the most important stuff.  I have missed all these time and i dont
know how many there will be after this summer because my cousin is going to McNeese
some are going to LSU some to UL, it wont be the same gang always together.
Me and Beau talked about all these old memories
Can you believe we remember picking blackberries and dipping them in a plate of
sugar while watching "" Are you Afarid of the Dark"" like every Friday?
When did we all grow up and leave our childhood?"

Some questions are better left without a reason
And I would rather reveal myself than my situation
Now and then I consider, my hesitation

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning, burning bright

I wonder if the things I did were just to be different
To spare myself of the constant shame of my existence
And I would surely redeem myself in my desperation
Here and now I'll express, my situation

There's nothing ever wrong but nothing's ever right
Such a cruel contradiction
I know I cross the lines its not easy to define
I'm born to indecision
There's always something new some path I'm supposed to choose
With no particular rhyme or reason

The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning, burning bright

thanks for the song mallory"

"event","Well this morning me and danielle left jennys at 8:30
i came home and slept and JUST woke up... that should tell you
we had an AWESOME NIGHT
so heres how the night went...

Chad came pick me up he looked soooooo cute he had suspenders
and everything! Then we went to Jennys and were the FIRST people there
( i should have known my friends always arrive fashionable late lol)
FINALLY everyone else got there and we took like 2748348357 pictures!
I finally got to see Lees dress she was raving about and it was sooo pretty!
We all went to meet Katee, Charles, Laura, Donny, Erin, Jordan, Sarah, Steven,
Mary, and Teresa at Carrabas but since we were an HOUR late they didnt have a table
and the wait was too long so of course Jenny to the rescue! Mr. Don had a table
all nice and ready in a private room when we got there! Dinner was so much fun
and the food was FANTASTIC! I feel so guilty because Mr. Don payed for it all.
The dance was fun seeing everyone and seeing who went with who but the music
was honestly not that good. It was hard to dance to and the songs were so old
i didnt even know what they were! It took like 30 minutes to take pictures.
We took a group one with all the girls! There was 9 of us so i HOPE it came out
cute!!!! We left the dance around 11:30 and went back to Jennys to change then went
to tina's. They had so many random people there but all really nice girls and guys.
I saw 2 guys that i hadnt seen in forever! 1 i use to be in love with in like 8th grade
and the other guy i was mad at for a reason. I talked to both of them for awhile and realized
1. the 8th grade crush is still very very cute and still the same personality( wowwwwwwwwwwww)
2. The other guy i had been mad at had nothing to do with a particular event so i really had
been mad at him for no reason. Its funny how things can be miscomunicated.
Well after we left Tina's we went back to Jennys at like 4 and talked about tonight and watched "" Meet the
Fockers"" but everyone was like passed out before we were into the movie about 30 minutes.
Of course i was the last one to fall asleep.

Well thats pretty much how the night went! Everyone was great and we didnt have any drama! YAY!
Im looking forward to next years!"

Really stressed about Prom.
Prom plans, Prom outfit, Prom hair and makeup,

Do we even know where we are sleeping?
I know that I'll have fun because i will be
with my best friends who are always fun
and Chad is so much fun!
I guess I will just have to let things
go as the must.

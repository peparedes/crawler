Are you trying to resolve them in a positive manner? You have a couple of negative influences in your life, they are the ones that have taught you how to deal with problems in a negative way. You need to deal with things in a positive way. Do not lower yourself by being petty or hateful, because in the long run you are only going to alienate yourself from the world and find that your company will be very limited. You are a very bright and good-looking young woman that needs to beleive in herself. Sweetheart, alot of bad things happen to good people, don't let that hold you back. Don't worry about what happened in the past just look ahead to the future. You're young and healthy,smart and attractive..... well three out of four isn't bad.LOL  just kiddin' {I know I got a smile out of you} keep cool, have fun, paece-out. LOVE, DADDY

I got my cartilage pierced with Steph. It's pretty cool. And if I didn't tell you before, I took my tongue ring out. So yeah.
You still didn't answer my question about the party. I would like to know how I was rude, because my friends and family didn't see it. We're all curious to find out. But if I'm rude and hateful, then so be it."

"event","Well, today was the Pride Parade, that was fun, somewhat. It was two and a half hours and everything else. Oy. I got so sunburnt it's not funny.
Afterwards, Amy, Rachel, Ryan, and I went to Barnes and Noble and then Cold Stone Creamery. On the way home, I got pulled over by a cop for speeding right by the police station in Romeoville. He said he was following me since the Speedway. Well, I think all of our friends have now gotten pulled over. I got a speeding ticket and a ticket for no insurance (I left the card in my wallet). I cried so hard. 
On the way home from dropping them off, my car stalls at Murphy and another cross street, so I call Steve. My gas was low (but not empty) but I figured I'd put gas in it anyway. We finally get my car started again and it makes it to the parking lot of the gas station, and I have to turn it manually (the power-steering went out, but I have plenty of practice at this seeing my car stalls every two fucking months) to the gas pump. This was at the Amoco in Romeoville. Steve had followed me there. We get out, get to Half Time, and it stalls again. Steve pushed my car into the parking lot, and all the drunks were cheering for him.
My mom comes after bitching at me for all types of shit and it sucks. We start going home, get about 75 feet on the road before it stalls it's final time. She ended up having to push it with her car into the Ace Hardware. Where it now sits. As soon as I find out what's wrong with that car and possibly get it fixed, I'm getting a new car.
Onto more personal things: I'm starting to like Amy again. After spending all day with her yesterday, neither one of us fought or anything. It was great. And I like her a lot again and I remembered all the things I liked about her in the first place. I stopped liking her because of the way she treats Rachel. She rides Rachel (in a bad way) all the time. That's not good. Which brings me to another point. Only a handful of people know this, but I like Rachel too. I've liked her since about May. She takes care of me, and I know that's why Ames likes her, but there has to be more than that for a relationship, and they think there is and that's fine for now. But in a few years they're probably going to want someone or something else for just a little while, but what can I do? I'll probably be long gone from their lives by then. 
That's all now, I'm going to leave with a bad sunburn, a bad headache from my psychotic episodes in my car, and some jealousy on Amy and Rachel's (but not much)."

"event","I'm so confused. I had everything thisclose to being at my fingertips, and I don't know if I want it anymore. I want to be a teacher. I almost always have. If I didn't want to be a teacher, what did I want to be.....a psychologist. But to do that, I'd have to be in school a long time. So, teacher it is......I get all applied at JJC, work out who I'm going to room with, and everything. My mom is thinking about going to be a medical transcriptionist at an online school, you get to work on your own schedule, everything. Sure, they have some education stuff, but I find what I've always wanted for only two years....psychology. People used to tell me I needed to get help myself before I could help others because I cut and all. But it's cheaper than JJC, and it's two years less than JJC. And I can work at my own pace. But Angel's mad at me, and I don't know how this online school thing is going to work out, so yeah. So tomorrow I'm going to JJC to see what I can get in financial aid, because that's a big part of it. So yeah. Pudgy told me if I don't want to go to JJC (BTW, Billy will be going to JJC for night classes on business) but here's the problem.....I don't know what I want. 
There's all my dilemma escuela for now. Here's some dilemma chiquito.
I was supposed to go over to Efrain's house today......(we used to call him Elifredo because he looked like Eliseo and Alfredo put together). More like Eliseo, though. Well, he got off an hour early for me, but we got wrapped in drive-thru and crowded in lobby so I got out late. He got mad after 20 minutes and left. He wants me to spend the night at his house Thursday night. I tell myself nothing will happen because we're just getting to know each other, but I don't know. You guys know how I am. I'd rather spend the night at Nicole's house because she'll just be getting back from PA. So yeah.
On July 2, I'm leaving. And funny story.....on July 2, it will be 3 years since I lost my virginity.
So here's the next day, I went to JJC, and they said I was only gonna get like 4 or 5 hundred dollars, dammit. So, I guess I'm stuck just going to the online school. But, you know, in two years I'll get to do everything I wanted to do.....work in a mental institution or hospital.
My dream last night was weird. I was back at RHS. I can't remember the most of it, but when I was leaving. Sade and Courtney were outside burning things for some science club, I went to Carissa's car and remembered that my purse was in school. So I went into the entrance to the business hall (from the bus parking lot) and went into the first room on the left and then the first room on the right (which is technically in the foreign language hall). And that room had a door to the outside, so I left from it. I had three things that were in my hands that were on fire, and a teacher saw them and told me to put it out. So I did. Carissa's car was gone, but she was over by Cassie's car. (Not sure which Cassie it was supposed to be, they both drive red cars.) Her car had moved. And as we drive away, she says that she finds it funny that Alli (????)was the only one other than the guidance office that knew of the apartment upstairs. (The whole school had a second floor.) And Pudgy goes, ""What do I know?"" This is really weird, random people popping in at random times to stick their nose in the conversation. I'm out."

"event","Word of the Day: contraneopseudoantidisestablishmentarianism. Try to say that. It's a word I found on a dictionary site. Can we make a song of it? It fits into supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.....if you speed up the ending.
Quote of the Day: Success is not to be pursued, it is to be attracted by the person you become.
Okay, so get this.....I've worked 34 hours this weekend, and they're still bugging me to come in for more today. It's my day off. Sure, I agreed to take someone else's shift, but you people wouldn't let me. I knew that if I went home and fell asleep, I wouldn't be getting up for the shift. Well, considering I clocked out at about 5:20, and the shift started at 6 this morning, I could've just stayed there and there would have been no problems. But no, they wanted me to get some sleep. I knew that if I came home and fell asleep, there'd be no getting up at 10 to come in at 11. Oh no, and there wasn't. I woke up just enough to call them and tell them I couldn't come in. And then they call me back to tell my to come in at 11. But I didn't go. I was still sleeping.
Tomorrow Steve and I work the same shifts. It'll be fun.
I finally remembered Efrain's pictures, but he wasn't at work when I got there to get them. Damn it.
I am really over Alfredo. When he was hitting on me yesterday, I was just like, ""Whatever.""
Squiggy pissed me off. He asked me if I was making Alfredo mad yesterday because Alfredo kept yelling at me in Spanish. I said of course, it's all right for Alfredo to hit my ass when he wants to, but I can't even look at him. Squiggy said that's the way it is. And I'm like, ""Oh no, it isn't."" Damn, if they think I'm going to continue letting Alfredo do that shit to me, they've got another thing coming.
I've changed since high school, despite the fact that it's only been a short while. I loved Alfredo, and now I don't. When I love someone, I love someone forever. But I just got tired of his shit.
Stacey Filip came through my drive-thru yesterday. It's been a long-ass time since I saw her. It's been since she was a senior. Also through my drive-thru was Wayne. (Now, Stacy's Mom by Fountains of Wayne is running through my head). Beckie Adams and Cassie Dowhen came into the restaurant and Beckie told me that she used to work 40 hours a week, no problem. I told her that I make more than all but two of the people, so they don't give me a lot of hours. But when I think about it, I work more hours than anyone else. This is what my McDonald's does now, it gives you really long shifts like 9-10 hours, and then really short shifts, like 4 hours, just to even things out. And like my bitchy great-grandma said yesterday, they're just cheating me. If I don't go into overtime (40 hours) then I'm getting cheated. So I'm attempting to get into the 40 so I can get some freaking overtime pay, but that doesn't look like that's going to happen. I just left a note for Angel telling him that I absolutely NEED 40 hours a week. Hello, I have college to pay for!
I just got back from Olive Garden with Steve and I saw Jess driving the van! I know, all of us Sidewalk Kids are growing up, and it's not weird for me to be driving and smoking, but to see Jess just driving (and hearing that my mom saw her kissing her boyfriend) is just shocking, I don't know why.
Here's my schedule for the week of June 20-27. 
Sunday~8p-5a
Monday~off
Tuesday~1p-9p
Wednesday~10p-4a
Thursday~3p-10p

This is my update.....3 1/2 hours after I woke up at 2, after going to sleep at 6, after getting home at 5:45, from a 14 hour 23 minute shift at McDonald's. Yeah, well Mike called off, so I stayed to cover him. Dammit. I was looking forward to seeing what sort of wacky stuff they would come up with overnight.

Instead, me and Alfredo were working our butts off all night, trying to get everything done. And even then, when Araceli came in, she had to do more stuff. Like, we had all the breakfast grill stuff out and hashbrowns, but the hashbrown wrappers still needed to be found, the tea still needed to be made (hell, Angel told me not to) and the old tea from last night still needed to be dumped. And the cream needed to be pulled out and gotten ready. I was washing dishes and when Alfredo came back to wash something really quick, water dumped everywhere, all over the front of my shirt. He looked down and smiled and said that it was fine. Of course it was fine for him, I was wearing a white shirt.

Alfredo was making fun of me for grill ordering a couple things without egg, when one of them didn't have egg on it. Well, he knows breakfast a little bit more than I (and I really do mean just a little) so he can shut up.

Quote: Mr. Saunders, how many licks does it take to get to the center of Madrigals? ~~~~>Ron Sparling, Jr. (Not actually said to Saunders)

Eating: Nothing. Just had smothered fries at Denny's

It's 2:54 in the morning and about 30 minutes ago I got home from Denny's. Tonight after Nicole got off at 10, Beckie, Cassie, her, and I were going to go pooling. Only Thursday is not ladies' night anymore. Boo-hoo. So we ended up at Denny's. Across the table from where Beckie, Nicole, Cassie, and Cassie's friends were sitting, were Ron and Angel. Since the one table was full (which was fine because I don't like being surrounded by people I don't know) I sat next to Angel. I apparently walked in on the middle of Ron's story, so he began again. The whole time he was telling the story, he kept looking at me (probably because I was across the table from him and I was the one he was catching up) but it was making me feel uncomfortable because I don't like being stared at. It had to do with gay white Russians, so let's just leave it at that. Well, not long after I get there, Cassie and her friends leave, and twenty minutes later so does Beckie and Nicole. So I'm sitting there at the table with Ron and Angel. We played ""I've Never"" with sugar packets and one equal packet to which Ron was winning with me close behind, and he forfeits the game cuz it's stupid, saying it would be better if there was alcohol involved. So true, even though I don't really drink anymore. So they continue talking because I'm a boring person, and I eat all the sugar packets minus one of the packets and the Equal packets. I told them (when Beckie and Nicole were still there) a funny story about Saunders, but I can't say what, due to the fact that most of you are still in class with him. I love Saunders, but this story is supposedly true (not hearsay, but an ""I actually did that"" kind of story).

I get to Denny's about 10:15, and Angel, Ron, and I left at 2:15. 4 hours for me, 5 hours for them at Denny's. Ron told us a sad story about I forget what kind of babies but yeah. And then there's the dead babies jokes, those are sad and gross too. Too bad there was no scoot scoot. I've only heard about scoot scoot, I've never experienced it.

I regaled the whole Cassie hand gestures thing for Ron, complete with how on that day he and Heather Shock were also chosen as speakers, and Carissa and I were marvelling at how sadistic the whole class was, to pick the three most annoying speakers ever to get across the group points. Ron was a monotone talker, and sometime during our stay at Denny's, he returned to that just to see what I would say, and to prove something else. Angel agreed with me that Heather Shock's voice will make you want to kill not only her, but yourself and everyone around you. And Cassie with the ""um""s and ""ah""s can drive you crazy! 

We talked about Cassie for a bit, went through the whole ""Ron's in the stadium and Cassie's at work"" thing and then Angel's ""I'm on the pitcher's mound, ready to pitch, the batter is in the bleachers eating Oreo's, and there's a guy on first ready to go home."" I could not even express my relationship problems in terms of baseball. But here I will try. 

I'm standing on the plate, waiting for the pitch from Alfredo, and he just keeps the ball because it's pretty, occasionally throwing it my way. I have someone standing in the practice swing spot while I'm pitching, waiting patiently for a turn. And someone keeps coming up to me and trying to get me to throw the ball to him. {It's funny because Mike would actually cut in front of everyone else and break rules just to get what he wants}. Then there's other guys in the dugout that I won't let try to swing at my pitches. And when Alfredo does pitch at me, I get a homerun.....but it ends up being a foul. But most of the time he's just throwing balls......teasing me to see if I'll swing. Oh boy, there was my baseball game.

Sorry, Ron, but I had to.......What's the difference between fifty dead babies and a Ferrari?

I don't have a Ferrari in my garage.

How do you get 1,000 dead babies in a telephone booth?

Use a blender.

How do you get them out?

Tortilla chips. (Scoot scoot)

Ew ew ew ew ew!!!!!!!

Angel, if you ever need someone taken care of, call me, I have the white Russian midgets that jumped into my car while I was at your car talking to you and Ron.

So that was all for my poor attempts at trying to be funny by bringing up things that only the people who were there would get.

Oh, and Cassie, Carissa, and Ebone. Did you miss the new memo?

You were right, Ron's really funny. But I'm still not part of the fan club. Sorry.

Angel, I'm off Monday and Saturday (I think) if yall want to get together to do something. I've got Cassie's and Amy's parties to go to the 26, but after that, I'm free. Well, not free but $50 but I meant I had nothing to do.

P.S. Thanx for kissing me.  lol.....lol (lots of love....laughing out loud)

I forgot to add, so this is an edit.....the natural procession is this....Ron goes to bathroom, Jen lights cigarette and starts smoking, Angel lights cigarette and starts smoking. Ron comes back and we resume game of I've Never or continue talking about White Russians."

Eating: Nothing.....though I have Krispy Kreme donuts on my coffee table.

It's 4:09 and Mike from McDonald's just left my house. He and I got off shortly after 12 and were hanging out in the parking lot for awhile, waiting for Eduardo to get off because he needed a ride home. {By the way, Amy, I found one of your earrings, I think you have the other one} So when Eduardo gets off we hang out some more, and then I take him home, with Mike following behind us. Then I change shirts and we all go into Eduardo's house and look at his overabundance of stuffed animals. I see a picture of his kids on the wall. Me and Mike go into his living room and sit on opposite ends of it, him on the couch, me on the chair. Then we go back into Eduardo's room and he shows us Maxim. If you don't know what that is, there's no help for you. After that, Mike and I get into my car, and I show him where to take Sugey on Friday. Then I show him where Alfredo lives. We go driving into Romeoville and go past my school and Jewel and then we head back to Eduardo's. He gets his car and follows me to my house. I point out Squiggy's house, but I think he didn't see me. As soon as we get to my house, he goes to the bathroom and I sit on the couch. He comes in, sits down practically on top of me he's so close. And we're talking about all sorts of stuff. Nicole said she can see doing him. I can't, but I will. More on that later, though. So then he whips out his thing and I'm like, oh no. But I wasn't looking. I had my hand under my other arm so he couldn't make me touch it. He told me just to glance at it, but I wouldn't because I'm afraid of penises (don't ask me why). I said curiosity was getting to me, but I fought it. Well, anyhoo.....we ended up on the floor, with my shirt up. Haha....that sounds dirtier than it really is. He wants me to pop his back by walking on him. Um, hello.....I'm twice your weight, probably! So I only use one foot. Then he wants a backrub so I climb on top of him and give him one. He kept saying he's getting tingles. Then it's my turn and OMG, I wanted to do him, but I can't because I have my period and that's just gross.

Okay, so the whole me doing him thing. Him and Alfredo have decided that we're going to make a porno, the three of us. It'll feature them and me. Mike and I figured it all out, Alfredo will be in the back (because he's been there before) and Mike will be in the front. But Alfredo won't like that cuz there are my boobs. Nicole was saying that they'd be able to feel each other because there is only a thin wall of tissue between the vagina and anus (nice info, huh?). Then Mike asked if they could pop through it, and she said no. That makes me feel tons better. I still don't know how I feel having sex with Mike, I don't think I entirely like the idea, but after that backrub......let me tell you.

Ambus grabbed me today and tried to kiss me and I just started screaming. Literally. Let's get something straight, Ambus is black as hell (no offense to black people) and 6'7"". Okay? I'm whiter than a hospital and 5'7"". He's a foot taller than me. But it feels like more. I go back by the ice machine, Ambus is there. He is trying to drag me to the cooler. He wants to have sex or is just messing around. With Ambus, it's hard to tell. But he didn't just start pushing me and then stop, he really was pushing me. We get to the door by the cooler and I turn off the light and throw myself onto the door so he can't open it. (It's funny the way instincts make you act) He pulls me off, opens the door, and throws me in. I feel like a cartoon at this point. Or a ragdoll. {Mike's at McDonald's right now. I couldn't go with, otherwise my mom would get mad at me.} He comes in. While I was still outside, Mike and Alfredo were right there, and I was yelling for them to help me. Alfredo walked over to Ambus and said to leave me alone, and as I saw the door close behind Ambus (as Ambus disappeared and I started to glow) Mike ran in, put his arm around me, and pushed Ambus out of the way. Leave it to good old Mike to save me from big giant Ambus.

Speaking of funny instincts, when Mike grabs me to get my head near his penis (he wants a blow job so bad from me-I don't know why, I don't do them) I grab onto him as tightly as I can. The reason for this being, if I'm up by his arms and head, I can't be by his penis too. But that stance only works for a few seconds on him. Once I'm on my knees, I throw my face at the ground, so he ends up humping air. I know, I have weird relationships with the guys at work.

As for Alfredo, he's not being shady today. He came in (I was actually scheduled for grill for once) and started talking about how he wanted to have sex. Well, dammit, it's been two months it's about time you wanted some. I don't have to worry about Alfredo just wanting head from me. He says, ""Me gusta tu pussy."" So that's good. Which means he'll do stuff to it because he likes it. 

Well, this entry is probably super long, because I've been writing for a half hour non-stop, so I'll wrap it up.

Peace and hair grease!"

Premarital sex? The best. It would suck if you waited till marriage and you end up with someone who sucks.
Drugs? It's your choice.
Abortion? It's your choice and not for me.
Adoption? It helps the kids actually have somewhere to live. No one should grow up alone.
Politics? They suck.
Bush (W.)? He sucks.
The other candidates? (shows you how much about politics I know) Like I said.....I have no idea.
The war? It's stupid....we're fighting for freedom? Or was that the last argument about the war and we're onto a new excuse?
The Army? Billy's in it.
Navy? Alex is in it.
Marines? Beckie wishes she was in it. Tim was in it. As was Colin.
Hussein and Bin Laden? Bush can fuck them.

This one's not as fun as the others, I know.</lj-cut>

See, I'm afraid of penises. Haha! And yeast infections aren't so bad. My mom gets them all the time and she doesn't have sex.....she got them more because she was allergic to my dad or something, and was always going to the doctor. I had a urinary tract infection.....twice.....when I was with Carlos. So yeah.
OH BOY YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT TO CATCH UP ON!!!! </lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""My life"">My life has had no real problems, if you look past my grandma, who practically raised me, developing terminal cancer and suffering a year longer than she was expected to live and dying when I was 10-and the fact that I knew people who died in the Oklahoma City bombing, and that my own family was supposed to be there at that time, but didn't because my mom had a migraine and was planning on going down later. I saw the sights, smelled the smells-and I was only 9. We walked out of an Oklahoma City shopping mall two minutes before a shooting took place in the Dillards we had just been in. The lady who gave birth to her son the same time and place my aunt was giving birth to her daughter died in a helicopter crash doing a news broadcast. All the things happened the same year. Needless to say, 1995 was a shitty year for me. But other than those things, my life has been pretty good. Well, except for the fact that my dad completely denied my existence for nine years (and it was the middle nine years of my life, not the first nine). That all sounds pretty bad, but considering I could have had to raise small children on the streets or live with an abusive family, or not have had a family at all....it sounds pretty nice. I guess.
But something became apparent in my eighth grade year that something was wrong with me. I wasn't happy, I cried all the time, and I started cutting. Myself. My mom didn't care.....even when I tried to commit suicide, she just turned her head away. And anytime I bring up the fact that I can't take too many pills or I'll get sick, she's like, ""Well, that's your own damn fault."" True, it is. But couldn't she at least CARE and get me some help?
How are things now? Not much better. I don't try to kill myself after two suicide attempts....it feels like yesterday that I was running through the house, grabbing all the pill bottles that wouldn't be missed and sitting on my bathroom sink with all the pill bottles lined up with their lids off. I had a bottle of Sour Apple Pucker and some Coke and took them all. Later we went to Fuddruckers and I had the worst headache (I've now had worse headaches......called migraines) and my mom was trying to give me Aspirin and I refused to take it.
The drugs eventually got out of my system, and I haven't been the same since. Too many pills make me sick. My mom once got me these energy pills (they were a sample) and there were 7 pills. Those made me sick also, because there were so many.
I still need help and my grandpa is trying to get me some. Couldn't I try to help myself? No, I don't have the energy for it. I'm either working, sleeping, or sitting on the computer. The only time I eat is when I go on break. I know that's not healthy, but I, quite frankly, don't care. 
My mom also thinks that mental disorders are fake. She has never come out and said this, but I know she thinks it, because she practically comes out and tells me. I tell her that I took an online quiz and it said I had this and she says it'll say the same thing for anyone. But she's taking it, and it comes up very different. She then said that it would show up something very high for anyone.....but my friend took it, and nothing was high for her......disproving my mother yet again. 
If mental disorders were fake, why are there couselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental institutions, etc......? She has yet to answer that question for me. Next time I tell her about my Borderline Personality Disorder and she rolls her eyes, I will pose two questions to her..........
1) Do you think mental disorders are fake? (She'll probably reply with an ""they are unless your name is something along the likes of John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, or Ted Bundy."" Okay, serial killers can have mental disorders.)
2) If they are fake, then why are there counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental institutions? And how come they have found PHYSICAL PROOF disorders such as schizophrenia and depression exist? (Okay, that was more like three questions, but okay.) Oy vey.
I have never actually said any of that before, and I feel like a huge weight is lifted on my chest, and I no longer have the desire to cut......for the first time in 4 1/2 years. Go me! I'm so exhilarated!!!!!</lj-cut>

Now go down two entries and take my ""Who is it?"" quiz. And that's an order."

Amy spent the night and we went to the drive-in with my mom. We went to see Shrek 2 and The Day After Tomorrow. Both me and Amy had already seen both, but my mom hadn't seen either. We left before The Day After Tomorrow because my mom had to pee. I tried stuff with Amy at my house, but nothing happened. Nothing happened, seriously.
It was funny the Mexicans I saw at Wal-Mart the day before parked right in front of us. In fact, we followed them in without knowing who they were. I know I could talk to the mother because she speaks slow enough for me. 
Anyhoo....I tried some stuff but nothing happened, for those of you who are wondering. Nothing happened, seriously.
I have my new work schedule, but I'll put that later. Cuz I'm tired of people asking when I work. I actually only work overnight two nights. On Thursday I think I only work 4 hours. Which is some bullshit.
My friend from Virginia Brent thinks I'm going to drop dead with all the working I do. It's really not that much. He works more than I do.

"event","I have a taste for something right now, but I don't know what it is.
I think I'm going to go on a diet, similar to that of Beckie's last summer, but with some Jen-ages attached. So here we go.....
Only two pieces of bread allowed to me a day. I have already gotten that today, as I had a bagel for breakfast. But tonight we're going to the drive-in and I want one of their hamburgers....they're so good. So I think I'm going to change that.
Well, instead of getting like Crispy Chicken sandwiches, or Grilled Chicken sandwiches, I'll get just the chicken. Instead of getting hamburgers, I'll get it without the bread. I'll still get what I like to get on it, just without the bread. It should take down the cal intake incredibly. No ice cream, either....not like that one's too much of a problem for me.
As for parking lots, parking far away so I have to walk. This working night shift thing is getting crazy, when I'm not working, I'm sleeping, preparing for my next shift. All this extra sleep will do me good, as I am used to not getting a lot of sleep, and your body burns fat more while you're sleeping. I don't know how this works, but it does.
I'm thinking about hanging out with Amy today, so I've got to get a move on if I plan to do anything....seeing as it's almost 3 o'clock. I don't know if I want Amy or Nicole to come with me and my mom to the drive-in. My mom and I are going seeing as I have tonight off and she has tomorrow off. The next possibility for this to happen is who knows when.
Yesterday pissed me off. Nicole made it out of McDonald's while I was there because I didn't see her, and she didn't see me. Then I get dropped off there again, Cassie came in ""looking for me"" and she didn't see me, and I find out 20 minutes after she was there that she was there. I was sitting where I always sit, and if she would've looked around, then I would've been seen. So Carissa came and got me (she's going to England today) and dropped me back off at my car. Needless to say, I didn't go to Anna's party, and my mom and I went to Denny's where Lewis waited on us. I asked him if anyone calls him Lewis Stevens and he said, ""No, of course not."" But it was obvious that he was lying. I said I was their friend and he said, ""You shouldn't be telling people that....it knocks you down on the cool scale a few points."" Haha. Cassie lost her virginity to him. So he was joking around with my mom and me the whole time. When he dropped and broke some dishes, my mom yelled, ""I didn't do it!"" He stood up, raised his hand, and said, ""I did! I did it!!!!"" And was jumping around. It was so funny.
After Denny's, I came home and went to bed, seeing as I hadn't been to sleep in 25 hours. And worked a nice 9-hour shift somewhere in there, spent practically all day at McDonald's....being left there twice....and ended up pissed off at Cassie, who then proceeded to call me and bitch me out for being late, when in actuality I was there an hour early. Waiting, for over an hour for Cassie, and then finding out she had already come and gone. Oy vey. More later. Leave one...."

I don't know how she'd feel if I told her that I went over to Angel's house one day. We were only there for ten minutes, but....yeah. She'd probably start bitching at me because he's her ex and into drugs. Well, anyhoo....Nicole told me I better never ""go to the woods."" I told her I would if I felt like it.

"event","I just got home and out of the shower, and now I'm updating. My scheduled-ten-but-turned-out-eleven hour shift is now over, and Alfredo is still a tease. He will barely have anything to do with me all evening, until the closers are about to go home (one o'clock). Then he'll flirt with his usual, ""Cuando coger?"" Eduardo (when they left) said to Alfredo in Spanish something about eating me. What Eduardo didn't know is that the closing manager speaks Spanish, so she heard him....and kept a somewhat sharp eye on us all night.
But it's when the openers come in that he starts to get really clingy. He'll smack my butt, and touch me as I walk by, or whatever. I have come to a reason behind this.....all of the night crew know that we dated. In fact, Eduardo still calls us boyfriend and girlfriend. I think that in the mornings he's only trying to show off me as his territory to the morning workers who don't know.
I get to see Araceli almost every morning now. That's great. I took one order for breakfast, but after that, Alecia made me give Araceli the headset and said I could run should we get a car.
Well, let me jump back to right after my first order. Dan was there (he came in late-surprise surprise) and so was all the other openers. I was pulling three trays of McGriddles out of the oven. The oven mitt must be thin in places because the heat came searing through before I was half-done dropping the McGriddles into their holder. I burnt the shit out of my thumb.
Now let's fast-forward to exactly where we were when I left off.....Araceli having the headset. Well, she finally got an order and they needed hashbrowns. Well, Alfredo and I overlooked the fact that lunch food had to be put away, and my breakfast food (hashbrowns) had to be pulled out. Well, we got a truck order so I couldn't get to the freezer. I eventually got there, and I asked them for some hashbrowns. Next thing I know, over a stack of boxes three wide and six tall on a rolly-cart-thingy, comes the box of hasbrowns. I got to grab it so it doesn't hit my head, lose my grip, and it hits my thigh, drags down my leg, and hits the ground, opening the bottom of the box. I quickly grab it and run out of the freezer and back to the front, where I drop the two necessary hash browns. That lady is lucky I knew what the hashbrown thing looks like and how to make and bag them. Cuz she didn't teach me.
Mike, one day, worked a 17-hour shift. So Sean and I decided, that when I learn breakfast better, we're gonna work a 24-hour shift. I know, we at McDonald's are a bunch of crazies.

I woke up late this morning. I was so fucking pissed....but I got dressed and made it to the school in less than half an hour's time. Which is good, cuz then I was ontime.
My dad and Christian left after the ceremony. He wanted to see my grandpa who just got out of surgery.
I had more to say, but this is the second time I did this entry because my computer froze mad-style and I lost the first one. And now I forgot all I had to say.
My mom hugged me for the second time in 24 hours....when we haven't hugged ever. I told Christian that I'll be coming down sometime.
I also promised Dad that I'll be coming down this summer.
I hugged Mrs. Danhof and she said, ""What's your name? Mister what? You're bad, but I love you anyway."" It was great. After the ceremony, Cassie changed into her blue gown. Cheater....I could've gotten in trouble, and she wasn't gonna go through her plan that she had planned since freshman year. Mrs. Soliday would be proud of me if I told her that at graduation I was being deviant....not only was I wearing the boys' blue gown, but a tank top underneath. Kelsey was wearing a bikini underneath. I just unzipped my gown, she took hers off and like threw it away or something. All I know is that it was nowhere to be seen when I saw her.
I'm so happy my dad came up. I honestly didn't think he was gonna come up.

"event","Sabrina has stated that my 14-year old half-brother (who looks almost exactly like me) is gorgeous. It's funny. I could tell Amy liked him, and I think he likes her too.
Here's all the people that came.
1. Perry, Sue, Micheal (not a typo)
2. Dad and Christian
3. Dawn, Danielle, and Jake
4. Bruce and his son
5. Marty and his new girlfriend
6. Amy and Rachel
7. Rachel's mom and brothers
8. Nicole and her dad
9. Lydia
10. Marylee
11. Sabrina
12. Angel and Pudgy
13. Steve times 3 and David
14. Marla, Kenny, Brittany, and Ricky
15. Bev and David
16. Cassie
17. Ebone

I have a feeling I'm missing someone. I'll add them on as I get to them. I've stopped at Ebone (#17)
I got this awesome necklace from Nicole. It's got our picture from Hollywood Pictures on it. It's engraved or something. It has our names on it too.
In total from all graduation, I got almost $2,000. That's fucking crazy.
I'm gonna wrap this up. My brother knows tons of stuff about me, and apparently Anna found out that alot of her friends are bi, and the ones she thought were, weren't.
I got sprayed with silly string by my brother and Steve. They went dancing off to Wal-Mart, and Christian brought back a basketball. A few minutes later, they doused me with Silly String. Rachel changed my ""trans fluid"" and my car is still screwy with something, but the strange clanky-type noise it was making has ceased.
My dad wrote me a $500 check. Talk about trying to make up for lost time. He told me if I came down, I could get a car from his dealership. I think I'm gonna take a week and a half off to go down sometime this summer before school starts up.
If I got as much money as I did, I've got my whole school paid for this year.
Everyone likes my brother, it's creepy. Amy said he was too young, and he's only like a year or 1 1/2 years younger than her. But that's okay.
We played I've Never at the basketball courts and I was the fourth one out. Carissa was first, then Angel, then, surprisingly, Cassie, then me, then Lydia, then Ebone, and we left it with Pudgy and Christian battling it out.
Later on, we played four-square after a quick rundown through the rules.
I think my dad is leaving tomorrow. My mom said she wants (or it would be okay with her) if Christian wanted to come up for a week or so during summer. I'm definitely going to visit them this summer. I want them to stay one more day. They got it today, they're leaving tomorrow, probably after my graduation.
Ay Carumba. I got to go.
I'm starting to breath like Shawn. And the words or swimming. So I'll let you go.
And....of course.....I had to take Christian to McDonald's."

"event","Tomorrow, I'm picking up Steve on my way to school for graduation practice. He doesn't have any finals tomorrow either, but he didn't have a ride. Him and I were planning on staying until 4 if Alfredo didn't show up.
Alfredo came in two hours late, bitching at me, ""Why'd you call me?"" I told him Angel wanted me to, and then he wanted to know why Angel didn't call him.....um, maybe because Angel doesn't speak Spanish? So he left again, and Angel realizes he's gone after half an hour, and starts questioning me where Alfredo is, and I said, ""Does it look like I'm Alfredo's keeper? He got mad at me for calling him and then he left. I don't know why, I don't know to where, and I don't know when or if he'll be back."" So, Steve and I had plotted that if Alfredo didn't come back, then Steve would take orders all night, and I'd do grill. But he came back, so neither one of us has to stay until 4.

<lj-cut text=""After we got out after third period today,""> Kat, Amy, Rachel, and I were hanging out. We were driving all over hell and back to try to find Angel's house. (Angel, Beckie's ex-boyfriend) We finally found it and Kat did her stuff and then we went over to the tobacco store. Well, after that our plans fell through and so we end up going to McDonald's, where Steve is taking money for drive-thru. On my way back to take them all back home, Angel Rouse calls me and wants to know if I want to hang out with her. She said she'd drive. So we go over to Crest Hill to find her friend Tony. Well, he's working, so we go to Office Max in Crest Hill, and he's there. So we hang out with him for a bit, and then we go over to her friend John's place, in Lockport. He's got two monitors hooked up together to make it one gigantic computer screen. He's into some heavy drugs, he was talking about how he ""only does coke two or three times a week."" Um, hello?!?! That's not an only topic!</lj-cut>

So, I didn't sleep until about 4:25, and I figure I can sleep for the 40 minutes. Well, next thing I know, I'm on the phone with manager Angel, and I'm still sleeping and the only thing I know is that I keep saying, ""Yeah."" He was apparently asking me to come in early. I usually leave my house 30 minutes before my shift starts, which my 6 o'clock shift today would have meant for me to leave at 5:30. Not the case. I left at 5:49. So yeah. But I didn't get in trouble. And Eduardo was supposed to have the day off, but he didn't, he was there when I got there. Well, he wanted sex, and he got it, so he can quit bitching now.
Kat knows about mine, Amy, and Rachel's sort-of threesome now. She thought it was funny that I had done anything with Rachel, and, shockingly enough, not too much with Amy. But anyhoo.....I'm out. Leave one."

"event","It was great, so much fun!!!! Between 11-12, we got 3 cars. Between 12-4:30, we got 8. So much fun! The rest of the time we were chilling in the breakroom watching television, or sitting on the couches in the lobby. 
After we got off at 5, Alfredo and I went to our respective cars. It's so funny how our actions are so similar. We get in our cars, turn it on, keep the door open, light a cigarette, and just as I was thinking of going to talk to him, he comes over to talk to me. I actually found out earlier this morning that his girlfriend's name is Ana, and they are not having a baby, nor has he ever gone out with Belen. So, see? I told y'all, but everyone thought I was living in a fantasy world, well I was wasn't.
Just in case anyone comes into here and reads before school today, I have 20-some Apple Dippers to get rid of, and I got stuck with them because I have school. Even though the date has passed, they're still good, so yeah. As of 12 this morning, they have been ""old.""
Steve was taking orders on front counter when I walked into McDonald's. He had worked at 4-11 shift. I'm so proud of him. Yea! I think he wants me to switch our hats back, but fuck no! He works 9-3 today.
I'm so not tired, but in a few minutes I'm going to get a Mountain Dew anyway, just in case.
I love working overnight. When everyone left at 1, I couldn't open my Apple Dippers (for some reason my fingers weren't working. Turns out it was the bag not me) and Alfredo opened them for me. He had to open from the bottom side because the normal place wouldn't open.
I had to waste 28 burritos from yesterday, and 82 Apple Dippers. I can't help it the breakfast people don't know how to produce burritos.
Alfredo was flirting big time with Carmen. But he says he doesn't like her because he has a girlfriend. Whatever.
He asked me when I'm moving to Wisconsin and I told him I wasn't moving anymore because I didn't want to. He kind of looked stupid after that, and finished his cigarette and then left. Well, I was hungry, so then I went through drive-thru. I'm trying to get Connie a job at where my mom works. Let's see if that works. Then I started going home and I remembered the Apple Dippers. So I had to go back and get them, and Connie looked at me like I was flippin' nuts. But then I left, promising her that I was really leaving this time.
Apparently, they've tried making her manager, but she doesn't want to have to deal with all the extra bullshit just for a few more pennies. Managers (at least shift managers) don't make that much more than regular crew people unless they've been working there a long time. Miguel has been at McDonald's for a long time and he makes 9-something an hour, which is more than Roy will make when he gets to be manager. And that's how it should be. The person that was there the longest should make the most money. But the person that has the most responsibility should get more also. But it's fine just the way it is. 
Well, it's 6:25, and I should start getting ready for school. I think after finals I'm coming home and trying to sleep because I have to work at 6 tonight. Maybe I'll work until 2 just to make more money. We'll see.
But, ha! Alfredo is not having a baby, or with Belen! JUST LIKE I SAID!!!!"

"event","My mom is making me have the graduation party that I didn't want to have, so I told her I wasn't doing anything for it....and I'm sticking behind that 100% not feeling sorry or anything.
And here's another thing, so far, I don't know anyone that's coming. I mean, aside from my friends here (Nicole, Sabrina, Amy, Rachel, and Marylee are the only ones who have said anything to me about coming) and my family in Buffalo Grove, no one's coming. I don't even know if my father is coming even though in October, ON MY BIRTHDAY, he promised me, even if he had to walk he would be here, and I haven't heard shit from him about coming. Maybe he'll bring up my brother and sister, that is if he comes. I don't want them to suffer without their big sis because he's selfish and lazy. But if he doesn't come, and I have already told him, that if he doesn't come to my graduation, he can expect to hear from me by getting an invitation in the mail that I am getting married. But no previous communication to that. I swear, I'll drive down to Oklahoma and rip his balls off....actually I'll have my mom do it (I've only seen them talk one time my entire life and she'd gladly do it) because I don't even want to go there and see those! Sorry if I sound I'm being funny, but I'm not. Truly.
I have to leave my house in an hour, at 8:30 because I work at 9 tonight, even though I have finals tomorrow. Yeah, I'm getting off at 4 tomorrow morning. This is gonna suck. It couldn't have been last night, where I only had one final today, or tomorrow, where I have no finals on Thursday, no, it had to be the night before the most finals. And the hardest finals too.....AP English and Psychology. Today I just had Consumer's Ed. It was 200 questions and I finished at 8:25,  when the class got out at 9:10. So yeah.
I just want to cry...my mom's planning on a lot of people coming (my god, she invited every member of our entire family (even though I don't know half) and everyone she knew from my father's side (I have never had a dad, he's a father. You have to earn ""dad"") and so far, I only know of one family that's coming...they're friends of my uncle, aunt, and two cousins, and then my uncle, aunt, and two cousins, my five cousins and one of their friends from Buffalo Grove, my mom, and the five friends I have already mentioned. I'm gonna feel bad not only for myself if a lot of people don't show up, but my mom for spending all this money (which I have yet to see anything from it yet) for all these people not to come. And the one part of the family that we planned this whole party for, actually, I received a letter from them today saying that they wouldn't be able to make it, along with $25. They're my cousin Steve, his wife, Dana, and their three kids (where the boy is actually mine) Ryan, Katie, and Danielle. So they can't make it, and I don't know of anyone out of town that's coming in. I told Mom not to make a big deal about it, it wasn't a big deal....but did she listen, no! And, come Saturday, who's gonna be the one crying because the 19 sub-families that were invited are not coming (not counting how many friends I invited...an infinite number, not counting the ppl at work and the people I invited by my journals) and that means they don't care enough to miss work for two fucking days to come on some day that I don't see as important, but everyone else does. I went to my cousin Melissa's graduation party 4 years ago, she should come to mine! Sorry if I'm being selfish, moody, and bratty, but that's how I feel and I can't help it. Blah! I wish she would have never forced me to have a damn party."

"event","Yeah, we didn't go camping because it was storming out and the tornado sirens went off last night. And stupidasses came through the drive-thru still. I so don't even freak out when tornado sirens go off. This place is not like Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, when the tornado sirens went off, you better get to a safe place five minutes ago. Here, the sirens go off, and everyone goes about their normal day. For now that's fine, but one day.....we're all gonna be sorry about that.
My aunt Lisa was freaking out last night, I heard. I wasn't even supposed to be working, but they only had five people, and by the time I had gotten there, there were only four....Steve was sent home early.
Mine and Nicole's Steve starts at McDonald's at 4 o'clock on Tuesday. That's my first night overnight. So yeah. And then I have two finals the next day.
Yesterday after I got off Squiggy wanted me to go to the bathroom with him. So I went. He just wanted to see my boobs. So I let him and then he unzipped my pants and blah. Well, anyhoo, he wanted me to go into the stall with him for, well, you know for what. And I didn't, I unzipped my pants and left to get a McChicken. Then he says, ""Geez, Jenny, I make you hungry?"" And then Eduardo started laughing. Oy vey.
I was trying to make Alfredo horny because I wanted to be with him, but it was working, but when I got off, he was busy with ten cars in drive-thru so yeah.
Eduardo had Mike go to El Burrito Loco for food, and I got a taco, and it was shaped like a hot dog in the wrapper, it was so small. But Mike got a burrito or something, and it was soooooo huge! I don't even know how he carried that shit. Alfredo ate 1/3 of his, and had a bite of mine. And so yeah, that was that.
Alfredo hit my ass and then two seconds later Mike hit my ass. They were fake fighting and fighting-fighting with each other. One time Mike came back to hit me with a soaking-wet towel, and Alfredo got pissed bcuz I jumped back from Mike. He grabbed the towel out of Mike's hands and they started fighting. So yeah, Alfredo was standing up for me. 
Mike told me that Belen is not Alfredo's girlfriend, they're related in one way or another.
One time I was taking an order and Mike comes running into the back and slaps my ass so hard that I screamed. It hurt so bad. He said his hand hurt afterward. Damn it!
He grabs my head and pulls me down like he wants me to give him a blowjob, and then I'm fighting with him, so I end up on the floor, putting my face into the ground just so I don't have to be by his penis. Makes for an interesting scene to the rest of them.
God, I hate penises. Alfredo's is the only one I'm not afraid of, which I don't understand.
Geez, when Michelle sneezes it sounds like she's gonna blow out her lungs or something. Urgh....it hurts just to hear it.
If Steve were there last night, if he hadn't been sick and gone home early, half of this wouldn't have happened. He would have stuck up for me just like when Mike shoved the broomstick up my ass, Steve turned around, grabbed the long handled dustpan, and shoved the handle up Mike's ass. They started fighting because Mike's a fighter, and that was my chance to escape and go home. 
I was afraid that Eduardo would want me to take him and Squiggy home last night. I knew Eduardo thought that last night was perfect for us to have sex, and I know if he would have gotten me to The Point, I wouldn't have been able to say no. Carlos, I think, is the only person who knows where My Point is. 
Anyhoo.....gots to go.....mas later.....leave one...

I worked with Eduardo for the first time yesterday since I walked out on him. Steve was in middle booth with me and Eduardo walked by. (FYI....Kat told Steve that I like him...I don't know how his feelings range.) I said to Steve, ""Eduardo's not mad at me anymore."" Eduardo turned around and came back, and said, ""What, honey?"" I repeated it and he said, ""Oh, yes...not mad."" And he hugged me and started kissing my cheek and then he licked it. Steve started laughing and said, ""I can see that."" When I went to go home, I was in the office with him and he started kissing my cheek after explaining that sometimes at Portillo's (his other job) he gets frustrated and takes it out on us. So yeah, we're all gravy now.
Today I was in grill with Mike....so exciting, I love grill! My first overnight shift is Tuesday night which is gonna suck because I have finals the next morning. And it's just going to be Alecia (our new manager), Alfredo, and me. And on Friday it's going to be Alecia, Mike, and me.
I know how to make a Big Mac WITH CONFIDENCE now. Before I just barely knew, now I KNOW!!!! Buns, special sauce on middle and bottom buns, onions and lettuce on middle and bottom, pickles on middle bun, cheese on bottom bun, meat on middle and bottom buns, pull the middle bun on top of the bottom meat, and close. Vwallah! A Big Mac! Now you can all make your own Big Mac at home...provided you have Big Mac sauce and cheese that has been sitting out for ""two hours""....more like 4.
I have my scrapbook almost finished....just a few more pix and I'm done. I'm going to have everyone who comes to my Graduation party sign it....as a memoir.
Well, I have nothing else to say. Adios, mis amigos.

I got to work, drive-thru was closed. Lobby was open. There were 3 managers there....Peter who works at Juan's store but has been filling in for Angel ever since Angel went on vacation at the beginning of last week.....Alecia who is from Lemont (Angel's old store---which sucks) and is now our overnight manager....and Carlos worked with me the one day I had to work at Lemont (he's from Juan's store also) and he was the closer. So Eduardo was off.
Tomorrow me and Steve from McDonald's are gonna do something....I like him. If Kat ever finds this, she'll tell him and he'll come read it. But I think I'm pretty obvious when it comes to me liking someone. It turns out he doesn't really like movies either. I mean, I'll watch them, but it's pretty hard to get me to watch one. I get so bored just sitting there not talking. He's really nice. We always pick on each other, I think it's cute."

Eduardo told him that I REFUSED to present and I REFUSED to go on break, and when I went on break I never came back. Miguel said I should have handled it in a more mature way.....well, if a 36 year old isn't handling anything in a mature way, then why should I? He was giving me the silent treatment, like  five year old. Hell, I work with a whole bunch of five-, six-, and seven-year-olds and none of them act like that. So he has to document that I left before my shift was over, and then he was going to talk to Eduardo. Well whatever.

<lj-cut text=""Well, this is all I gotta say..."">

Fuck you, Eduardo....
Fuck McDonald's too....
Fuck this whole world....
I'm gonna sue them all too.

I have dedicated my life and soul to McDonald's since April 11, 2003, and my repayance is to get reprimanded. How many times did Beckie get to walk all over him? Why? Because he was having sex with her so he gave her a break. But I only kissed him once.....so yeah. And lately, whenever he touches me, I give him the evilest stare I can come up with. So maybe that's why he turned me in for leaving. How many ppl no call no showed at him? Too many to count (Monse is the only one that comes to mind right now) and did he turn them in? Oh no, he didn't.</lj-cut>

I'm eating Mini-Oreos now. Tomorrow is my last day with the kids. :(( I got them all gift certificates and candy. So....yippee!!!! But that leaves them fat, and me still sad. Tons of pix I will take tomorrow. Oh, yes.

I was getting ready to go present, when Roy asked the guy that was in there (Dave, Jon Parker's brother) to stay a few more minutes. Roy asked me to do some more things for him. When I was done, I went back to wait for Dave to leave. We got an order on counter, so I went to take it. Miguel comes over and says that he's on register now. I go over to get in the booth, Sean is there. I turn to Eduardo and ask, ""Okay, what am I doing?"" Silence. I told Sean that he was mad at me and he was ignoring me. Sean didn't believe me. Cameron asks me to run for drive-thru because he was leaving, I go to grab a bag and Eduardo says, ""I got it."" I started to get the next order for him and he grabs the bag out of my hand, throws it down, and then says, ""I got it!"" So I just stand there for a few more minutes, asking him what I'm doing. So that's why I'm pissed about that.
Noelle slapped Nicole about something. It had something to do with Happy Birthday and Nicole was sitting there reading her book and saying nothing. Then Noelle got up, slapped her and say back down. Everyone's like WTF?!?!?! And Nicole starts crying. I hope Noelle didn't hurt Nicole's jaw again. God, I really want The Lantern, which is in downtown Naperville."

I asked him if he was like Carlos where you have sex once, you have sex forever, and he never responded. His name is Sabino, really sexy, right? Yeah, I know. And he lives in California. I met another guy too, and he's SUPER nice and he wants me to give him my cell phone number when I get a new one because yeah, so we can talk. His name is Carlos, and he's also from California. I met a girl also, and she's from Texas. I never got her name but she seemed like a slut to me....she slept with 13 or 14 girls in the past year. Um, yeah...how about no?
I've decided I'm not moving to Wisconsin, I want to stick around here. Maybe Angel and I will get a place together, set up by JJC. That would be awesome. We could have Pudgy and Steve (our two best, not straight friends) stay the night and have parties. Oh yeah! Angel's the best. Plus, when Amy spends the night....they're friends. And Angel doesn't swing that way, but we can still party.
Well, Carlos is back online, and we're talking again. He says he's back online just for me. We're never going to meet, he lives in LA, for Bob's sake!
That's all for now....oh yes, Sabino is the one I cybered with. Twice. Haha, he's funny. Be sure to read the post that shows up right underneath this one. It makes a lot of sense and everyone better copy and paste, and take it to heart!"

"event","I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE COMES AND READS THIS......IF NOT, COPY AND PASTE IN YOUR OWN JOURNAL.

It's a new phenomenon: online journals, or blogging. It's a way for you to get stuff off your chest and put it out into the open. The problem is, your friends, foes, and family can get their hands on this. Unless you are very vague in your journals, it will come back to get you, and you will get several nasty replies, in both the journal itself and in real life. Here are some things that could go wrong......

FRIENDS: A friend could make you mad or you suddenly get pissed at them~~>and vent in your journal. Problem with this is that your friend will read it or someone who is friends with them will read it and you'll have a blog war going on.....that will translate into real life. Not fun. So be choosy about what goes in, or make those offensive entries private. And if you don't care if others read it, then prepare yourself for the battle you'll receive.

FOES: Let's say you're harboring a secret and all your friends know about your journal and read it more than the daily paper. Well, if your friends and strangers have access to it, doesn't your enemy. Like, if you just had sex, or you're pregnant, or you're gay, or your parents are getting divorced, whatever...something personal, your enemy finds it, prints it out, and hangs it all over school, reads it over the intercom, etc....that's why you should be choosy about what goes in your online journal.

And finally.....FAMILY: This is probably the least harmful to some. They can take it if their parents get mad at them for really going to get their eyebrow pierced instead of working, but they cannot handle it when their friends and classmates turn their backs on them for being gay. But, mind you, you can still get in trouble and grounded. And the ex post facto laws do not apply to parenting, they should, but they do not.

Blogs break up friendships, or at least put a lot of strain in them. So please be critical when writing your journal.

Peace and hair grease, paste this in your blog.

Rachel came up to give me a hug, but I gave Amy one first, because I went up to Amy to give her one, and she said, ""Oh, sure, fine, give her one first. I see how you love me. I was the first one to kiss you, and the first one to..."" and I didn't hear anything she said after that because I was apologizing. 
Erica Miller did ""Take my Breath Away"" and everyone knew just by her hair that she was doing Jessica Simpson's version. Damn it, she was not the original singer. You can't do a cover of a cover song! Argh! A lot of people don't like Jessica's version. But I do, I just like the original better. 
Yeah, my mom gave Amy a hug today. When was the last time she gave me a hug? Um.....I couldn't even tell you. Was it when I was depressed and suicidal? I can tell you that's a no because she distances herself from me as much as possible when I get like that. Well, here I am, in the same boat. ""I don't wanna die, sometimes wish I'd never been born at all...."" as Queen would say. Carrie didn't even know that there was more to the song than they sang, it was just an inappropriate song for school. ""Mama, just killed a man. Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead."" I think that's pretty much all that they left out. I'll have to bring in Bohemian Rhapsody for Carrie to hear.
I loved how Liz was always acting the stupid one, she's really good at it. Not saying she's stupid, I think she's awesome, but she's good at ACTING stupid. She sits next to me in Consumer's and mumbles to herself and me about how stupid Mrs. Medema is and everything else.

"event","Today was really a pain in the ass
I got out of bed because I had to throw up. I'm really sick. I mean REALLY sick.

I feel sad, because Janine and Maribel are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STI, just bcuz I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday.

I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from school. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty.

Last night I had to masturbate twenty times. I'm so horny. Click here to see my website.

I want to tell the world that my girlfriend Amy is the bomb! She made pizza last night, and even though I burnt my lips on the cheese, it was awesome!!!

I am masterbating right now....want pics?

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's some photos of my girlfriend in the nude (but don't tell her that I've posted them here - she'll kill me! Har har.)

I want to say thanks to Cameron and Eliseo for Saturday. Woo-hoo!

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have Borderline Personality Disorder. That gives me a license to commit homicide, he says. Niki watch your damn back. And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you who you're sexually compatible with.

Hope you had fun catching up in the wonderful world of Jen. See what you miss out when you don't talk to her?

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with some naked photos of myself. (Not safe for work - teehee).

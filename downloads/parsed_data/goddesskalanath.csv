Hi there.
I was wondering about the rope spider web in the back of your post here and if there's anything you could tell me about it like who made it, how they made it etc. I am genuinely interested.
Thanks in advance for your reply.

My answer:
Yeah, My sub blue designs them- you can contact him at bluesoul@access1.net
The web itself is welded from wrought iron and hung from an electric suspension unit.  It holds quite a bit of weight- we have affixed a sub and sat two Mistresses atop him. It is great for rope bondage with subs or whether used independantly or with a sling/ swing, it is an ideal hanging throne for a Domme (foot worship, ass worship and teasing and denial take on a new meanings with the hand held control).


PS-
 Here are more pics of the web:

"event","I really want a houseboy.  Someone to cook and clean, run all of My errands, pamper Me and remember all of My likes and dislikes.  He should be quiet- but not stupid.  And, he should be organized, attractive and creative (artistically).  I do not need a male friend- I have a million- I need a little worker bee- who's joy in life is serving the Queen.  This should be easy for a Domme, but it is not.  I have interviewed what seems like millions of bumbling idiots who equate houseboy to boyfriend.  No!  Let Me start again.  He should be submissive, into chastity training, able to take discipline, geared towards perfection and ready to go when I call.  That's not unreasonable- after all there are men who have altars of Me in their homes!  So, back to positivity- I want a houseboy, a good, honest, hardworking boy who is dying to please Me!

"event","In the last year I have experienced alot of change.  Just last X-mas, I was on live-journal bitching about the state of My life and now- now My life is fine, and I just BITCH!  It is awesome!  I don't have to work anymore, I got a new car, a new computer, a new wardrobe, all new friends and a new apartment in San Diego.  When I choose to beat and humiliate men for $200 an hour, I have lush enviornments in which I can facilitate these interactions.  Today, I go to Palm Springs to visit a sub friend, be pampered and shoot content for My website!  So, just thought I would spread a positive note!

But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk  does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave  when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please
I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine




To you... hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love
I have inside... I love you

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
But love is all I have to give

But those pills you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only

I'm nice to you, I could make it through
That yer already somebody's baby
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me baby

Because your candle burns too bright
Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight

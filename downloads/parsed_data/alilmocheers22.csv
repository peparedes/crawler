Yeah..anyways..I just went to Taco Johns..and sat in line for like 30 minutes because the lady in front of us kept ordering more. I am surprised they had any food left by the time that lady was done ordering. Stupid people. Anyways, we have to do this poetry project for Mr. Pack, and its due like Tuesday or Wednesday, but I have practice every day next week and I will have NO time to do it, so I did it all today, yeah..12 poems. And I finished. yay. They are kinda retarded..but oh well.

I woke up at 12 today. It felt so good to sleep late. I was super excited. Considering the fact I woke up at 5 in the morning yesterday to go shopping, and you know what I left with. Exactly, Nothing. Yeah, how depressing, oh well..you don't always get what you want :-/   .

I have a stye(spelling) and an eye infection in my left eye. How fun. It hurts like crap, but I'll be ok. I can't believe its almost christmas..how great! I love christmas..it's awesome.

Well, I think i've bored you all with enough..so, I am out.

What fun!.! I am so fed up with some people, mostly the kid who keeps commenting. Thanks for whoever is doing it. You are so annoying. Grow up, and get a life! 

I went the mall a second ago, I found a lot of things I really like!! I am getting this Nike gym bag tomorrow! Yay! I am so excited, its pink and it's so cute. It looks like a mini backpack! WooHoo! Tiffany is supposed to be getting this one. Its really cute too, but I am obsessed with Pink! So yeah..I like the pink one! He he! Oh yeah, I found me some converses too, they are pink and black. They are awesome! But, I think I may wait and see if I can find me some army ones. I like them better. But oh well, you can't always have what you want. :-(


I walked when I got home, just me and mom. It was fun, but now I am tired, and I still have to study. fun, huh? So, I am going to go, and I am sure I'll have some comment put in here by that lame ass who needs to grow up!!

"event","OK, well let's start off with last night. I think last night was the most interesting night I've had in a while.Some of it was good, and most of it was bad. Well, first of all, me and Jimmy made up, so I'm glad, because we got into like a horrible fight, and when i say horrible, im not joking. I love you Jimmy! Well, me and Tiff went to the movies last night, and seen cookout, turns out, we left early to go walking around, b/c it was the dumbest movie ive ever seen. Well, I got home, checked my comments. And there was the start of my bad night. I'm not even going to say what was in it, so..don't ask. That really made my day whoever did that. Thank you. After that was pretty okay.

I think I'm going to Tiffany's house after she gets home from 7&6 thing. Woohoo. I love the Tiffany

Well, I am going to go...I'll talk to you  crazy kids later!

"event","Well guys. Let's start off by telling you my progress reports. Tee Hee. Gym-100 Math-85 Health Science-84 English-87(Which is really good for all the classes I have). So I'm very happy. I beat Tiffany in Health Science, ha ha ha! I love her though. Even though she sucks at Health Science, wait, I think EVERYONE does. Who cares. Tiffany came home with me today. We went to the mall and got pizza with my Mamaw. Then I went to Peircing Pagoda, and had a crazy idea I wanted the top of my ear peirced again. So my mamaw was like oh gosh, Morgan, I have to sign all these papers, what if something happens and your mom sues me. I was like Mamaw, it's not like my ear is going to fall off. I least I hope it won't! Ha Ha. So yeah, I got it peirced, and it hurt like 2 seconds, and it's fine now. Tiff was going to get hers done if she would have had money. I am going to take her one day and get it done. He He. I think it's really cute though. So, I am  happy.
   We went to the Freshman game, which was really boring, but me and Tiffany have fun wherever we go. Ha Ha. It was cool. We took her to SunTrust to meet her Daddy. Then I came home and did my stupid Math homework! Fun. Then I studied for my ""Antigone"" test tomorrow, which is supposed to be really hard. Wait, EVERYTHING is hard in Pack's class though. You can't help but love the old man though. He's a great teacher, considering the fact me and Kristen learned NOTHING in Mrs. Isom's class last year. Thanks Mrs. Isom. My class is awesome. Jake, Patrick, Jordan, and me always cut up. It's fun. I have a project due in there on Monday. Thank goodness it's not a big one. 
   So here I am, with all my homework done, and nothing to do. So, I am going to go over here and chill. IM me on AIM if you want to.

Comment. They make me smile :-)

"event","Hm. What so say. Oh, yes. Well I got to school, went and talked to all my friends outside before school starts, because thats the best time to talk to everybody. Went to gym, then me and Keela went walking around. It was fun. Then we went back to gym when the bell rang. WooHoo. We played like Eclipse Ball, or somethin. It was cool. Went to math, Mr. King told Julia if she shot the peice of paper in the trash can, we wouldn't have homework, so we all didn't get our hopes up, because she sucks and making shots. AMAZINGLY, she made it! WooHoo, Go Julia! So I had no homework in math. Then, the dreadful class Health Science, went in there, found out we had a quiz in which MORGAN had known NOTHING about. It's all good though. I don't think I did too bad. Then I went to my favorite class ever! PACK'S class. Yes, I do admit he's pretty cool. We finished ""Antigone"" which was an AWESOME story, considering the fact I love greek drama. The ending was sad though. Tear. We get to read another greek story. WooHoo. I hope it's ending is better than the last one. Well, that was my day.
  Lets talk about something other than school, because I've rambled on enough about it. I think me and Tiff are going to the Freshman game tomorrow night. Not sure though. I went to Subway a few minutes ago. It was awesome! I love subway, and I havn't had it in forever. Woohoo. Go me. 
  I really wish it would stop raining. It is so depressing. I want to go outside, and jump on the trampoline, but no, just because of stupid tropical storm ""FRANCES"" Ha. Ha. I hate storms, they don't scare me, they are just boring. We get progress reports tomorrow. Holy crap. I think I did really good in all my classes except one. Which I'm sure you all can guess. Well if not, let me help you. HEALTH SCIENCE. It is like the most BORING class in the WHOLE entire WORLD. But, everyones doing bad, so it's not that bad for me. He. He.
  Have you all noticed that there is like nothing to do in Morristown these days. Hm, they need to get some new restaurants too. I eat at like the same place every week. We need something good, something like my FAVORITE place in the world. RED LOBSTER!! Mmm, I love seafood, and guess what. . .we have nothing but Long Johns, and Captain Dees. Dude, that is not Seafood, thats like FAKE!
  Well, I think I've put enough in here, so I'm going to go get me somethin to snack on, and watch me a lil' TV. Yall have a good night, and be good!

I just love Keela. Anywho, who else do I love. Oh yes. TIFFANY! We had an awesome time in lunch today. It was great! Lunch is always great because the people in it are awesome. Even though the food is god-awful. My knee itches, so I think I'll scratch it. My livestrong bracelet is supposed to get here sometime soon. I got it off of e-bay. Lol. Don't make fun of me cuz im cheap.

You can get along with<br>pretty much anyone. You are able to fit into<br>any type of crowd and can be popular one day,<br>or not noticed the next. You keep ALL your<br>friends in check by stating obvious solutions<br>and telling them to never regret anything they<br>do in life. Because of your logic, people DO<br>sometimes find it hard to get along with you,<br>but once you assure them that your logic only<br>comes when is needed, they open up to you and<br>can tell you anything. You are most likely the<br>""shoulder-to-cry-on"" in your group(s)<br>of friends and many people look up to you! Your<br>power would be to unite all universes with your<br>logic.

"event","I am just joining after a few years of all my friends being hyped about this live journal stuff. I thought it was just another way for everyone to know everything about everyone else and therefore it would just be more drama in my life. But then I realized that it would be so much easier to communicate with my friends cause when schedules conflict we can know whats on each others' minds. My life now consists of strictly boyfriend drama and thats no fun. I'm happy everyone bugged me to play around with this stuff. 
             Love, Adrie :p"

Friday the 13th is suppose to be some scary thing where every thing goes wrong. the only thing that went wrong to day was my dream. so my dream started out in my living room which was in the school. (dont ask) me and tiffany were sitting on a couch when some kid from cuba popped out of a ""secret"" door on the floor. anyway he touched us we screamed and then went running into a door which was a lesbian house and they held us hostage until we broke away and ran throught the lawn to the springvill walmart.(We started out in Franklinville, once again dont ask) we were standing there looking across the street from the walmart watching the brooklyn bridge collaspe in the brooklyn bay while 5 pirate ships sunk with the bridge. then this little kid with one leg decided to cross the bridge she fell and a man with one arm saved her. and it all ended with me waking up to incomplete by the backstreetboys at 6:30 this morning.  well that was very interesting.. ok well i have to go be cool like the awesome chick that i am see you homedawgs later."

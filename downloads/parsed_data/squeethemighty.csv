Just a brief update.  School starts for the 05-06 year tomorrow for me.  GULP.  Time to get busy again after a summer of slacking off.

This summer, given the divorce and the chaos of last year, was SO needed for me.  I didn't do very much, but that's how I wanted it.  A lot of reading, movie watching, relaxing and walking about town.  And lots of chances to go out and about with my new SO. :)  Yep, squee is dating again!

Now, if the Cubs can just win the wild card....

Book plans have been put on hold for me for a while.  I've just hit road blocks in revising it that I can't seem to overcome, so I don't know what's going to happen with it.  If anyone's motivated in helping me think through some of that stuff, I'd love to assistance, but I'm a bit stymied.  Would send more details if someone were interested. :)

A random thought before I finish:

It's an interesting world we live in where you can either go to see ""The Great Raid"" about the rescue of American POW's in WWII or ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalo"" at the same movie theater at the same time.

"event","Hey guys,

Just thought I'd do a brief update in case anyone's watching who wants to know how I'm doing.  When we last left Squee (cue TV announcer's voice) he was in the process of dismantling his life. :P

Actually, things are going alright.  The house sold - I'm in a new place near to my school.  My first ever 'bachelor pad' - it's kind of a new experience.  I like having the place to myself to do with as I please. I'm in the midst of making a dinner for one right now actually - the oven is cooking.  Doing ""breakfast for dinner"" tonight - scrambled eggs, sausage, oven roasted potatoes.  Home cookin'. :P

The divorce finalized two days ago - my first ever trip into court for my own business.  It was a bit intimidating, but it's all done now.  I'm officially Single Squee.

Well, not entirely - I have begun dating again over the last month or so.  I won't go into tons of personal details here, but it's a good thing.  Low key right now!

Anyway - if anyone wants my new contact info or wants to check in, I can still be reached at my normal e-mail address.  Beth-kai and Arianwahr (ok I can't remember how to spell that - K anyway) have that contact info and they should feel free to share it out. :)  I'd love to hear from anyone who wants to hear from me.

Summer's started so maybe I'll be posting a bit more!  Free time!

love,
Squee"

Been a little bit again - life has been CHAOTIC (not sure if good, evil, or neutral).  My house sold - to the first buyers to look at it - go figure.  I have located a condo as well.  Features include:

-2 blocks from my current house
-10 minute or less commute :)
-hardwood floors
-2 bedrooms
-granite counters
-new stainless steel appliances
-sunken living room
-central air

I am planning on getting a cat as well - I need name suggestions?  Somewhere in college I remember discussing the name Fang Destroyer of Worlds - still pondering that.

On Spring Break currently - dealing with lawyer-ish contract stuff relating to the house and condo sales.

The gym workouts continue.  I am up to 30 minutes now on the elliptical :)  Go me!  8 lbs down, but I'm not sure it's all about the weight loss b/c my body shape seems to be redistributing too.

Oh - at long last I cut my hair - no longer the side part I've had for 30 years :P  it's a wacky world, I tell you.  And the full beard is gone and turned into a squared off goatee :)  My new look.  Watch out, universe.

Divorce is still pending paperwork - inching its way along - but no giant hassles at the moment.

Life is proceeding bit by bit.

"event","A few gym-newbie related items to deliver:

I get one session with a trainer to establish my workout.  Turns out the trainer's name is Augie.  I'm being trained into buffness and superhuman fortitude by... Augie?  My apologies if your name is Augie, but still.  Now, I have yet to MEET Augie face to face, but I'm not holding my breath.  My current total association with the Augies of the world would be former Cubs shortstop Augie Ojeda.  Augie Ojeda was an excellent fielder, but never hit a homerun.  I'm not sure he hit a ball out of the infield?  He was, however, a fan favorite, as they enjoyed shouting, ""Augie!  Augie!"" when he would come up to bat.

"event","Alright.  I did it.

I walked into the gym, said, ""Give me the tour!""  And off I went.

It wasn't so bad, actually.  Large, faceless, and anonymous, which is kind of what I wanted.  I wasn't exactly looking for a gym to be a bonding activity at the moment.  I just wanted a place where I could go, run around, lift things, and come out exhausted.  It seems like it will fit the bill.

Started my one month trial membership.  We shall see how it goes.

Any advice in general from all you gym-experts?  Not so much on finding a gym, but on what to do at one now that I'm there... I'm going to get a one session with one of their trainers just to get me into a basic routine, and I did some searching on the 'net for simple workout activities.  Any little insider tricks though?

How many of you combined actual diet changes w. going to the gym?  Did you make purposeful plans to change nutrition?  Alas, I'm still a slave to processed foods - so easy.  Have to remind myself to take time out to cook again.  I did enjoy it for quite a time; I just need to discover that energy again.

You've seen the show, now?  Kind of like Kung-Fu meets Cooking.  It's hard to explain.

Anyway, it was Battle Chocolate & Coconut, so every dish had to use those two ingredients.  And three of the five dishes had to be savory rather than sweet.

So there's the one chef with like five different little mini-chocolate desserts and EACH one is accented with a different kind of salt.  I'm fascinated - there are THAT many different kinds of salt?  And who puts salt with chocolate?  Well, apparently, or so they tell me, a little salt accents and brings out the chocolatey-ness of chocolate.  My brain boggled.  Yay for Iron Chef.

Seriously, what do I need all this stuff for?  Currently typing this livejournal message sitting at The Monstrosity That Calls Itself a Computer Desk *tm*  This thing is NEVER coming out of my house.  But I built it with my very own hands!  My own hands, I say!  I'd eat and sleep at this desk if it weren't... well... a desk.

Currently trying to work out how to get the house all ready to sell (if you couldn't guess).  I still keep turning the gym thing over and over in my head.  I do have a Bally's nearby to my house - that's the closest gym I know of.  I kind of want something anonymous, if that makes any sense.  I want someone to show me how to use the machines, set me up on a basic regimen, and then let me do my thing.  It is close by, but I don't want to get locked into a huge contract and regret it.

Some of the whole gym thing feel surreal to me - if you'd told me - even as late as the end of college - that I'd ever want to lose weight, I'd have laughed at you, all 110 pounds of me would have laughed.  And yet, there I am.

Part of it too is just - well I know exercise is supposed to be good for mood, it's certainly healthier than a lot of things I could be doing, and why not?

"event","Glad to see that I wasn't the only one who was ""behind"" on LJ - though I fear I am more behind than most.

Life progresses here.  Actually, what provoked me to get online was a teaching experience today.  It was something I was proud of, but it wasn't the sort of thing that gets noticed, exactly?  So I thought I'd pat myself on the back and blab about it.

We've finished reading Stephen King's ""Carrie"" in our horror novel class - a whole separate strand of thought about that and whether it's a book we want to keep - but, in any case, I had set the class up to be a debate about whether or not ""Carrie"" qualified as horror, or as science fiction.  On the one hand, you've got the blood, the guts, etc.  On the other hand, you've got the whole ""telekinesis"" angle and the pseudo-scientific articles throughout the book.

I initially created a fairly complicated debate-style lesson that ran with my second hour class and did fairly well.  However, it became apparent to me that, given the fact that my 5th hour seniors perform at a much lower level than my 2nd hour seniors, the lesson which worked well in the morning really wouldn't work well in the afternoon.  Over my lunch, I was able to alter it and streamline it to make it ""easier"" without sacrificing what was important - the discussion of the differences between genres.  And, within limits, it worked.  I walked away from what is usually a frustrating senior afternoon class feeling like they'd said valuable things and really thought about the key concept.  Yay.

Progress on my novel has continued.  I've finished my second round of editing and now I need to actually MAKE the changes I noted for myself.  They range from little things like single spaces after periods instead of double spaces, to large scale things like re-envisioning dialogue to make characters seem more distinct.

After that process is finished, I think I'm going to print a small run myself to distribute to colleagues here at school.  With a whole English department at hand, I figure I can get some good ""objective"" expertise.  I have subscribed to Writer's Market and have been browsing agents, though I haven't sent off any query letters.  The more I looked over my manuscript, the more I began to think that it needed alterations before really being publicized.

In the meantime, I've started a short story that I'm fairly happy with.  I'd like to keep doing short stories in the interim of working on the novel, just to keep myself working, and maybe with an eye towards publishing something small to build a credential for myself.  Entered a writing contest as well - deadline is 12/25 so we'll see what happens.

To be honest, I never know if the whole writing for publication idea is a pipe dream of if it has any substance.  I know that what I write pleases me.  And I've been told that I have talent - but I've never written in a terribly formal setting.

I'd love to find a local writer's workshop or go back and take creative writing classes, if only to get ""critical"" feedback on my writing.  I remember my creative writing courses at Brown, and how offended I was at some of the critiques at the time, but looking back on them - I understand now the gist behind the critiques.  If I can open myself up to constructive criticism, I know I have room to grow.

So, other than annoying personal life stuff that I'm not ready to discuss, that's what's going on here.

Here come the holidays.  Presents ahead.

I still exist.  Haven't had the time or the brain power to really write anything for a while.  School has begun.  Shocking how much of my daily time and thought that takes up.

Not a terribly good day here.  Many unhappy things on my mind.  It's hard b/c I don't really know how to go into them.  Nothing life-threatening, I suppose.  Just not making me a happy camper.

The problem is that - as I've often bitched and whined about to myself - I'm still very much adrift here in the Midwest.  School is school - who makes friends with co-workers really?  I don't know.  I'm caught inbetween at RB here.. it's sad but the people I gravitate towards tend to be the 40-50 year old set.  The 20-30 year old set seem to spend their time at RB going to bars after work.  Still hasn't been my scene - what a stick in the mud me.  Have I been trying to be an old person before my time?  Why would somebody do that?

Had my first official student freak out yesterday.  As we were to watch a film clip, mentioned to a student, ""Student, unless you are working on an assignment from me, please put your notebook away.""  The student just began to totally melt down.

""No!  I will not!  I don't want to watch your stupid film!""

Do they do this in grad school?

Put her ""out in the hall"" as it were.  When I went out to deal with her, it was like she had a force field that only admitted what she saw as hostile comments.  Example exchange:

Student:  Let me go down to the dean.  I want to see the dean.
Me: I don't want to give you a discipline referral to see the dean.
Student:  You can't give me a referral! I didn't do anything wrong!  The dean won't believe you.
Me:  I just wanted you to stop using your notebook unless you were working on my homework.
Student:  You can't stop me from writing!  I was doing YOUR stupid homework!  How can you stop me from doing YOUR homework.

Sheesh.

So, doesn't that make you want to all run out and be high school teachers?

by the way... I've deliberately held off asking, but... has ANYONE other than graymalkin read my novel that I sent out by any chance?  I'm just a wee bit curious... e-mail me or post here?

"event","So this annoyed me...

I am part of the mentor program at my high school - that means that, after seven years of teaching, I am considered a ""veteran teacher"".  Thus, when new teachers enter the building, I am assigned one as my ""protege"".  I kind of take the protege under my wing, make sure that they mesh with the school community, watch some of their classes, take them out for coffee, etc. etc.

Anyhow, yesterday, we had our official ""mentor/protege teambuilding"" day.  That's a day where the mentors and proteges meet together and do some facilitated exercises to help them get to know one another.  Then, at the end of the day, you fill out a little private list of who you'd like to have as your particular mentor/protege.

So, we're at this teambuilding thing and, at the beginning, the facilitator, and outside consultant, says, ""Some of these exercises are physical, and we don't want anyone to be hurt, so if you feel like you might injure yourself, just opt out of the activity.  Also, if you have anything going on in your own life that makes it uncomfortable emotionally for you to do an activity, just step to the sidelines.""

Fair enough.

A few activities in, we go outside and he sets out this big long, fifteen foot jump rope.  And the activity was that two of our group turn the rope and everyone has to jump once over the rope without getting it snagged.

I don't know why, but I just didn't feel like this was the acivity for me - so sue me.  So I ""opted out"" and stepped to the sideline.  No big deal.

As we were debriefing the activity afterwards, he makes some of the following comments:

""So, I was so impressed with the people who stuck with the activity the whole way!  It shows real effort and determination.  You could have just quit at any time but you didn't.  THat's really something.""

and...

""You know, I've done this activity with corporate types, and there's always some who grumble and go, 'No... not going to do this' and they don't stick with it.  Those are the types who probably do the same thing in the work environment.  But it's good to see so many of you really tough this out to the end.""

OH MY GOD!

Could he BE any more offensive???  I don't think any of my teachers/mentors/proteges cared that I opted out (and I wasn't the only one!  I started a mini-opting frenzy - three or four others), but FOR GOODNESS SAKES, it's a jump rope!  Yes, I am going to abandon my school and leave them to flounder because I metaphorically don't want to jump a rope.  WHY SAY that opting out is okay if you are going to be INSUFFERABLY rude about it afterwards?

Bleh.  Who pays you enough for this?"

I'm really torn on how to review that one.  It's very well done - there's evidence of craft, thought, emotion, sincerity.  And yet, it's almost TOO MUCH of these things.  It's like Braff is making a movie going, ""Look! Look how much I care about my movie and how good and artsy and special I can make it!""  The characters are almost TOO quirky... the shots almost TOO pretty?  I know that's a strange thing to criticize, but there it is.  That having been said, I did like it - it's worth a view.  Maybe he'll get more subtle as he directs more.  I know other critics have liked this film, so he's got a bright future, I'm sure.

"event","So - was watching the Cubs lose 8-6 to the Padres last night and found myself getting all sorts of irritated.  And then it made me think about last year's playoffs with the Cubs and a little story...

In 2002-03 I had perfect attendance at school - no missed days.  It was stupid, but I realized that the school gave like a fifty buck bonus for perfect attendance, so I wanted my darn fifty bucks and thus I became determined.  Lost my voice?  Went to school.  Flu?  Went to school.  And thusly I was rewarded.

03-04 comes around and, again, I am similarly determined.  Then the Cubs enter the playoffs.  Well, I can't remember which game it was, but it lasted until 1 in the morning and the Cubs finally lost.  And I was so ticked off at it that I couldn't fall asleep and it was then 3 in the morning.  So, I was sitting in the bed, or lying there, thinking, ""If I fall asleep right now, I'll get three hours of sleep and then have to teach.""  That wasn't going to happen.

So, after over a year of perfect attendance, I succumbed to an acute case of Cub-itis and called in sick, dropped off my lesson plans, went home, and slept it off.  And even though the Cubs lost more games after that, the infamous Bartman game among them, I somehow survived.

The upshot - why in the world would sports have this kind of affect?  It's not like I KNOW the Cubs or am friends with them.  Whether they win or lose, my life continues.  And yet... and yet...

So, this year, innoculating myself against Cub-itis, I hope.  Well, either that or they better not lose...  not a promising chance given 96 years of failure.

Oh, BTW - chapter one of new novel is done.  Yay."

Came in thinking it could be brutally awful, but was VERY pleasantly surprised.  Actually, my favorite movie so far this summer.  Michael Mann makes tough films.  Also appreciated that this one had more than a few ""I can't believe the movie just did that!"" moments.

Plus the film delves, even if superficially to some, into existentialism, and, well, just do a little of that and you've got me hooked.  Why am I stuck on the whole ""is life meaningless? if so how do you live it?"" argument?  Always have been, probably always will be.

Of course, I'd love for summer to just keep on going - I like the free time.  I'm not a person who gets bored.  My mind is too active - I keep having more things to do.

Life got busy for a week - preparations for the beginning of the school year.  Actually, I hope that's not a pre-cursor to how busy the school year will be.  I'm actually very glad that I got hooked into livejournal so that I have a sense of how all of you guys are doing - been too long since I was in any sort of contact with anyone.

Picked up the 9/11 Commission report this past week.  It's been interesting reading.  The biggest thing it's made me realize is that, when it comes right down to it, in a crisis, it's not the ""big brains"" that make any sort of a difference.  On the actual day of 9/11, honestly, it didn't seem like Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, Rice, Tenet, etc. etc. really were in a position to make any of the important calls.  The crucial decisions were made, at the moment, by base level FAA employees, NORAD workers, passengers on Flight 93, etc.  And that wasn't the administrations fault - it's a nature of how fast everything happened.  I think that sometimes we want to believe that things are simpler than they are - that if ""The Powers That Be"" just came up with the ""right"" plan that we'd all be safe.  Realistically, reading the report has made me think that there's no real plan that's going to ""fix"" this problem.  That you do the best you can, and you take your chances, but that the world is too big, and too complex.

Good days to be a Cubs fan on another note - enjoying their mini-winning streaks.  Go, Greg Maddux.

Have now grilled pork chops, chicken breasts, hamburgers, and steaks :-) I'm a grilling machine.  It's just so FUN... and easy... and carnivorous.

Been doing a lot of movie watching as well.  Recently, finally saw 
""Spiderman 2"".  Also saw ""The Village"", ""Some Kind of Monster"", and ""Manchurian Candidate"".  My capsule reviews:

""Spiderman 2"" - when it reveled in campiness it was good.  When it tried to be serious, it was bad.  Did anyone notice the uneasy Christ imagery of Spiderman crucified on the front of the subway car?  Or was that just me?

""The Village"" - not as good as I wanted it to be.  And it took me multiple days to figure out why.  Here's why.  Every one of Shyamalan's films before this one have centered themselves around a 40 something male character enduring a spiritual crisis of some sort.  This one changes that pattern.  It's not that I mind a female protagonist, but I don't think Shyamalan handled Howard's character as well as he's handled Willis and Gibson in the past.

""Some Kind of Monster"" - cool and interesting but TOO long.  It's amusing how like movie characters Metallica's band members become.  Hetfield and Ulrich aren't ""people"", they are parts, and I don't think they really know it.  Or is that just the magic of a documentary.

""Manchurian Candidate"" - fun and interesting, but ultimately too muddled to work.  Who's bad?  Who's good?  Who are we rooting for?  Are we supposed to be happy or sad?  I'm totally lost.  Watch the original.  Although, it was fun to watch Denzel try to bite Liev Schrieber.  You don't see that in a movie every day.

Next on my list - Zach Braff's ""Garden State"".

OH! Also - has anyone else picked up on/noticed the 2005 ""Fantastic Four"" movie casting list coming out?  I'll buy Michael Chiklis as The THing, but Jessica Alba as the Invisible Girl?  No.  Just no."

Now that I've finished writing ""RL"", I want to start working on the next book - ""Answers May Vary"".  I know how I want to begin.  The first chapter is fully scripted in my head.

It's not writer's block - the idea is there and I know what I want to write.  Something else.

Also stuck on re-working ""RL"".  What I have to do is re-read it CAREFULLY for grammar, because I know there's a bunch of proofing errors.  I did a little of that today, but it's like, now that it's done, I want it to self-correct.

Kind of stuck on figuring out what to do next with ""RL"" too.  For so long, the idea was just to finish writing it.  Now I want to do more with it.  I guess I need to get the proofing done, then get a Writer's Market or whatnot, but I really have no idea what I'm doing.  Or if there's even a possibility that anyone would ever want to publish it.

My parents recently got a new BBQ grill - silly promotion where you buy an exercise bicycle and get a grill, don't ask me.  Anyway, because they had a new grill, they were going to throw out their old grill.  Since I didn't have a grill, I took their old one.  Just one of those timeless, Weber, black bucket type charcoal grills.

Anyway, yesterday, I decided to grill for the first time.  Set everything up in my concrete driveway (no patio for me :( ).  Had a steak and some pork chops marinated.  Figured I'd grill extra and save for later.  And I didn't want to leave the fire unattended, so I brought out a chair and a book to read while I cooked.

Yet, I couldn't get myself to read.  I just kept sitting there, on this gorgeous summer evening, listening to the grill sizzle, smelling the smoke.  It was totally hypnotic.  I can't explain it.

Ok, this IS a political note to some extent, but realize it also involves a discussion of flesh-eating zombies, so it shouldn't be TOO boring.

I was watching the Democratic National Convention last night (flipping over to watch the Cubs beat the Brewers - got to have your priorities straight!).  And I did have many and varied thoughts about it, which I won't go into - but here's the thing.  One of them (Gore?) was discussing how we need to face the reality that another terrorist attack of some variety might be inevitable.  And I've heard that from other sources, so I filed it away and went on about my evening.

Then, that night, as I went to bed, had another dream.  This time, was trapped in the basement of a house and zombies had infected the surrounding suburb and were upstairs trying to get in.  I wouldn't have connected the two items, the dream and the convention, except that one of the people trapped in the basement with me made the comment, ""At some point we have to accept the fact that those zombies are coming in here.  It's inevitable.""  Then ensued a panicked break from the basement to the street at night, a chase by zombies, and waking up - yuck!  Am I the only one who has dreams like this?  Was it just a random piece of my day seeping into my subconscious?  Bleh!

By the way - on a different note - definitely nervous about sending out my novel manuscript for public consumption (i.e. by my friends) yesterday.  I have no perspective anymore if the thing has merit or if it's garbage.  I know that it felt good writing it, that I said things that I wanted to express, and that the story kept me interested and entertained.  But I'm an audience of one.  Beyond that, I'm blind to the text at this point."

Details are fragmented, but we were all adventuring in some sort of cavernous tunnel.  It was a combination between gaming it out and actually being there.  I was playing Cruz.  There was some guardian in the tunnel we had to get by and I was going to kill him, but then the voice of Dave was some powerful vampiric NPC who told me that I was under control and would be punished if I killed the guardian.  So, in Cruz fashion, I cloaked the area in shadows, snuck behind the guardian, and threw him onto Molly.  The hope was that no one would understand what happened, Molly would be startled, and attack the NPC and kill it - thus getting rid of the guardian AND angering whatever powerful vampiric NPC there was.  Two birds with one stone.  Cruz was always such a jerk.  But I don't know how it worked out!  I woke up!

Still have 1984 thoughts running through my head.  Shows how addicted I am to ""happy ending"" stories - I KNEW that Winston and Julia don't end up together, but when I read it again, when he betrays her and says that the rats should bite her face off instead of his, I'm like ""nooooooooo!""

Side note after reading Cleverpig's entry:  I think being away from all of you has made me dumber -- I miss being a student, doing research.  Ending up in the position of teacher, sometimes it becomes assumed you ""know things"" by virtue of being a teacher.  We're as much learners as anyone else.  School wants to add a Bible as Literature component.  My immediate thought is:  Me? I have no spiritual background whatsoever - what the heck do I know about the Bible?

Perhaps it's trite, but it's so easy to see connections to modern day politics and news.  An example:

Found an article the other day (can't recall the link) that talked about how, several years ago, Kerry was referred to in magazines and newspapers with adjectives like ""daring"" and ""charismatic"" and ""dazzling"".  Now those adjectives are applied to Edwards and Kerry gets ""aloof"" and ""cold"" and ""complicated"".  How can he be both?  Was he hit with the ugly stick over the last few years?

1984 talks about the idea of doublespeak, of holding two contradictory ideas in mind and believing both of them.  This applies to the above idea, but so many other thoughts as well.  To wit:

-We are constantly under threat from a devastating terrorist attack, but go out and enjoy America as if nothing has happened.

-We went to war to find WMD originally, but NO, we really went to war to liberate the Iraqi people, but we also allow other dictators to exist unfettered.

-All men are created equal, but they can't marry one another.

And so on and so on.

"event","Have you ever noticed moments in your life when every little thing starts devolving down towards the same theme?  There should be a word for that.

The theme for me recently has been, ""Who is looking out for you?""

I was thinking about it as I read darkwhimsy's linked article regarding stupid computer games that are produced without being ready for public consumption.  It was also on my mind as I (finally) picked up Eric Schlosser's book _Fast Food Nation_ yesterday and finished it today.  The same theme also occurred to me upon taking my wife to the fertility clinic for minor surgery today when I was informed that the doctor didn't generally talk to the patient or the patient's husband after the surgery, but rather waited for a scheduled follow up, so I realistically have no idea how well the surgery went other than that my wife is walking around and talking and seems ok.

The theme seems to be that people basically do what they feel is in their best interest to do.  The computer game producers will produce any game that sells, I suppose, regardless of the quality.  Only if the reduced quality = reduced sales would the quality perhaps change.  The meatpacking industry and fast food companies don't particularly care about health except as it relates to whether or not people will buy their products.  For instance, I am sure you are familiar with the flap that McD's got on frying french fries in beef tallow forever.  Then they changed to 100% vegetable oil, except that, apparently, what makes their fries taste good is that they taste vaguely like beef.  So in the 100% vegetable oil, they added ""beef extract"" as a non-labeled ""natural flavor"".  When that was discovered and a flap arose, they changed that practice as well.  Except that, in Canada and Australia, no such flap arose, so they still fry the fries in beef tallow there.  Doesn't matter what the ethics are - it's whether or not the consumers will buy it.

What I kept struggling with, even as I was frustrated, was honestly trying to decide if this mentality was a terrible thing.  Isn't it natural for people to be guided by what they feel, on an individual or corporate basis, is in their best interests?  Or am I falling victim to amoral capitalism?  Is this mentality the way life is, or just the way we've been led to believe life is?

That was far rantier than I intended it to be, so off I go."

Myrkai is still dying, conversations with Arianhwyvar are still intense, nostalgic, and fun, Greymalkin still cooks wonderful food and makes me smile, and so on and so on.

"event","I have learned that you should never form an opinion of someone based on what someone else has told you about them.  Keep an open mind until you have taken the time to get to know that person yourself."

"event","1.  Never judge anyone, unless they have proved themselves to be truly evil (Hitler and Pol Pot would be good examples).  You don't know what's going on in their life.
2.  Always be nice to people even if you don't particularly like them (see number one).  
3.  It is always best to understand both sides of an argument before you choose which side you're on. (How many people really do this?)
4.  You can't change people, you can only change yourself.
5.  Studying for an exam over the course of several weeks actally does work a lot better than trying to cram it all in the night before (wish I'd known that one in college!)"

"event","OK, so I'm taking a statistics course online.  All of the course material is in cyberspace, which means no textbook.  I consider myself to be pretty decent with computers, but man do I hate this.

And here's the jab.  Somewhere, someone decided to change that good 'ol formula of y=mx+b (where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept) to y=a+bx (where b is the slope and a is the y-intercept).  So now b is a and m is b.  This is so confusing.  Don't they know I learned y=mx+b fifteen years ago and that's how it's going to stick in my head?????  Now b is not b, it's a; m is not m, it's b.  WTF?"

"event","Remember that movie?  Was it with Bill Murray and Andy McDowell?  The one where he wakes up everyday to Sonny and Cher singing ""I've Got You Babe"".  Well, if there were actually any stations here in Kinshasa that played something besides Congolese music, that movie would be a succinct overview of life here.  Not that that's bad or anything.  

There are many things that I have started here that I would never had done had I remained in the States.  One of which is taking the prerequisites for nursing school.  This actually consumes A LOT of my time.  I have also learned how to write HTML (very useful these days).  So at least I'll have some skillz when I return to ""civilization"", where ever that may be.

I for sure have some hilarious anecdotes to tell about this place, but it's lunch time and my blood sugar needs a boost, so I'll save those for later when my brain works..."

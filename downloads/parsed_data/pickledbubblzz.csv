I volunteered at a ""Sports Day"" for disabled kids this weekend and felllll innnn lovvvvve with a few of the little ones, however after a day with them I was tired and so have found a new sort of respect for the parents and live-in aids of the disabled. This was followed with nights of drinking, and enjoying the company of my friends. A little bit of wrestling, but what's new.

I kinda wondered what the hell the noise was...I just assumed it was a firework or something.
Seconds later a man runs into the office yelling ""CALL 911! A man just shot himself in the head!""
So I dialed 911 while my co-worker Byron ran outside to see what happened.

Who the hell kills themself in the parking lot of a park?
I spent hours comforting little kids who saw the man shoot himself and lie there, bleeding from the ears with an eyeball detached from his face. Why not just kill yourself in your own house, save Lomita Park for baseball and skateboarding...not hara kiri.

And yet, as I moved the crowd of kids back from the basketball courts surrounding the parking lot... I felt as if my youth watching Power Rangers and CSI had desensitized any normal emotional reaction one would expect to occur at the crime scene of such an incident."

"event","to hair extension or not to hair extension...<br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""that is the question."">bye bye 90 dollars. <br />I could buy a razor scooter with that money. <br />or 90 99cent cheese burgers. <br /><br />however- <br />it would look great. <br />i could wear it for 3-4 weeks. <br />my dress cost less than 60 dollars. <br />so really... <br /><br />i dunno <br />3 weeks. 7days x 3weeks= 21 days. 24 hours x 21days= shit...i dunno alot <br />i was gonna try and figure out how much i'd be paying per hour for hair extensions but i'm too tired to do any more Yamada, i mean math. <br /></div>

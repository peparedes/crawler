"event","So.. Nothing new at all... Don't love my crush anymore, want to kill him. My sister went to see me last week. I'm not gonna move to my father's house without hitting him with a candelabra. I'll got my hair cut by tomorrow. I hate world. I can't wait until X-Men Legends 2 get on the stores. I NEED to play and NOW. See? My nose is already bleeding. I saw the livejournal of a guy today, a guy from an X-Men legends 2 forum.. I like him. But he isn't gay anyway. Well I don't think so, and I ain't gonna ask him. Maybe will I? My venus flytraps needs to be fed... Maybe I'll give them a spider later in the evening... My friend is going out of the town for two weeks soon. I already miss her. With who will I walk at 4 a.m.? Sadness. I hate my mother. Old bitch ^^. Maybe will a tall mister with a moustache push her in the stairs someday? O_o;;. I need pepsi. Luckily I got some =). Thinking about that, the guy I was talking about knows Elvira... That guy is a God... I can't believe how much I love Jean Grey. *dance* I ate too much. I feel sick. I wish my lovely bastard to bastardly love me. Sigh. Viva Spongebob. (Did I say that? Please kill me -_-;;) Blessed be."

"event","My rainy day... I got a Venus Flytrap. I called her Diane. I love her. But i don't like HIM anymore. I want him to suffer. Like all of them. All of these who think they're better than the others. But who am i to judge who has to suffer? I already had my own pain. My father is there. I want to live alone... I can't stand having to ask for everything i do... I can't wait until summer. It seems so far to me... ""Sanctuary: A small safe place in a troubling world..."""

"event","My day was such a great one! I tought it would be the worst of the week but it wasn't... I think now i understood something. Maybe I love him, but it's a one way love. So, i'm gonna move to something else!! I can't cry like this anymore. It's over. I listened to Nanny 911 earlier. It's a really good show. I wish i could be a God. No, a Goddess. So i could help people more than now. And be as pretty as i want. It's not that i think i'm ""ugly"" because to my eyes all people are beautiful in their way, but you understand what i mean. I don't really know what to say so I'm gonna go. Blessed-be."

"event","I had a kinda good day at school. English (a new ""funny"" project about comic strips...) French (my desk is next to my crushe's one... i love him so much..i think ;_;) Physical Sciences (we listened to a movie about tornadoes. i cried because some plants were dead, and i felt some sadness around) and finally Informatic (boring. i sang, the mother of my ""friend"" is dead. i cried again). I tried to make chips with apples. They were so gross. But i ate them anyway because i was so hungry. The is a paedophile in the town. I'm scared, i want him to go to jail. sometimes i hate my mother. I dont know why but my friend seems to be mad after me those days and i dont know why (please nini tell me why :-( ). I'm lucky my friends are here. cynthia, dimitri, justine... i love you so much that sometimes i cant stand it. i want to be loved... i want to love... i guess i had my part of happiness when i was young, i got to give some to the others now. I'm so sleepy. I want the boy i love to love me but again and again he doesnt. I still talk to my plants. If they weren't there i think i would cry all the time. i tell everything to my plants. i love them. my ivy, my cactus, my tree. I'm sad again. but i'm happy to write here. the people are so nice here... and nobody of my town can read it because they wouldn't understand. the english, what i say, what i mean, what i think. i'd love to be somebody else. i'd like to be more myself. i dont know. i will sleep now. it's late. i love you."

"event","What a great day. The weather passed from sunny and hot to snowy and cold within 2 days. The day was boring. And because of an accident i won't mention here, i couldn't walk too much. I have the biggest maths homework i ever saw. I need it like an ugly person needs a mirror, if you see the comparison im talking about me, this isnt suppose to make somebody sad, if it does just sream: I'M SAD. and i'll understand. The boy i have...had...have a crush for is attracting me so much. My dad whom i love so much *so sarcastic that i reach the mental problem* called earlier. It finishes a day quite well. I will now go drink some pepsi. What a purrrrrfect idea."

"event","Today it was so rainy here. Like in the titanic, without the boat, the red-haired woman and the sexy actor. I stayed home. Yesterday my mother freaked out because i said i wanted to put on some eyeliner. She's so ""oppened"" (sarcastic). I talked on the phone almost the whole day with my friend Madeleine. I also downloaded ICQ and if anyone is interested my number is 320-025-871. I didnt finish my reading resume and its for May 30th. Yay. So fun to do T_T. Thoses last days, i didnt ate so much. I must be sick. I discovered that ricotta cheese is not good with lazagna. And its worst if the lazagna is accompagned with parmesan sauce. (My mom likes to try things) School tomorrow. I dont wanna go. And there is physical education wednesday. I hate that so much. The guy for whom i have a crush will maybe play ping-pong with me, because we are obligated. He hates me and sometimes i want to kill myself because that makes me so sad. But now i'm ""happy"" because i have pepsi on my side. I'll try to sleep late to make the day comes more slowly. Carli finaly made me an avatar. Yesterday's Charmed was great. I wanna live alone. I'm sick of my parents. I'm sick of my life. I'm sick because i got a flu too. (what a great mind word) I listened to Catwoman twice today. I listened to it 304 times. I'm so proud. It's the biggest thing i ever done."

It's her birthday today, i hope everybody can take care of her. lets remix that. i hope everybody will stop killing her T_T. making her sky black and her oceans toxic after she gave us life is a sign of non-respect i think. the place where we live should be better treated than that dont you think? Whatever. I hope on this day at least you will take care a little bit. Not drop all kinds of junks on the ground, but in a garbage. Try do walk, dont use cars. And the most important. Thank this earth that has been so generous with us, us who doesnt take care of her. Meow."

"event","so fucking tired, and so completely awake

I built a proposal in 3 days.

pros:
billions of money from the NIH
recognition from key players in my master's/PhD conversion
experience in working under a deadline with people that don't speak english

cons:
not being able to study for an exam
not being able to play soccer
not being able to chase girls
not being able to leave before 2am
days lasting from 9am to 2am
back pain
hunger
loss of sleep

I still need to go to lab in the morning to finalize some captions. I feel incredibly accomplished and responsible for getting this thing done so fast, but my mind has been consistently wandering lately. I need more from this town than a PhD and a nearly paid-off mortgage.

The french kid is coming this weekend. The march of dimes is this weekend. my mom is coming this weekend. bob's bachelor party is this weekend. my sister is having a dinner party this weekend.

so much shit.

good luck in the shit you deal with each day. we're in there together.

no one fucking reads this."

"event","Life is currently good. One way or another, I've been going out every night or at the very least having a few beers around the house with people. My advisor spoke to me for a while the other day about the project I had suspended from last semester. This semester won't be so exhaustive so I should make some progress now.
I came to lab in the morning yesterday, and I'm in here now waiting on equipment to warm up. It's a bit strange that I don't feel tired from the lack of sleep, but I won't question it. The excitement from great classes and a good semester ahead is probably to blame.
One thing that's bad is that the soccer team seems to have disbanded, which is okay to a degree. The pick-up games are still full on weeknights so that'll have to tide me over. It may be better off since I'll be taking advantage of free weekends in the lab or working out with Charlie and Joe.
The centrifuge is probably ready to go now, so I'll cut this rant short."

I'm here burning oil (with intermitent procrastinating) making a presentation for tomorrow's presentation in Tissue Engineering. The weekend was lost to Sudoku and various Diane-related events that kept me from doing school things. I skipped the soccer game because it's fucking cold now, and there's yet another exam coming up this week (I don't want to be sick).

Anyhow, back to powerpointing. Enjoy the mental image of a 'Fuxiangyuan Moon Cake' whatever it may be for you. Oh, I got on an internet IQ test kick earlier to waste time. I got a range from about 125 to 145 on some of the timed ones that linked out of wikipedia, but all of them were pretty much the same, and extremely biased toward particular things so.. I'm happy with at least being unofficially above average at doing IQ tests.

"event","On Wednesday, Math basis only lasted until 6 because I cut out early, but the bus took 40 minutes before it came by, so by the time I was walking home through our neighborhood, there were little kids running around already. I booked it over to Publix to get some kit kats and crunch bars, but missed the large group of kids that comes by all at once every year. They had just passed by my cormer :(

There were about 3 more groups that came by after that, but not nearly enough to make a dent in the candy bowl. After a while, I headed back to my room to study for my exam at 9 in the morning the next day. So, there was no going out this year either; no dressing up.

The exam went fine, and it was a good choice to study, but Halloween is the best, and it was sad to miss it. After my test, I finished some homework for molecular basis and went to the class to return some other people's homeworks that I had graded last weekend. Sinan, Ege and I watched the sum of all fears that afternoon and played soccer at 8. Then I crashed at home and watched some tv.

Today I slept for about 16-17 hours to recuperate. It's been busy lately, and it was great to have this homecoming off. My back is feeling much better (I hurt it working out about a week and a half ago) from all that rest, and I still have Saturday and Sunday to prepare for next week. 

There's a molecular Basis exam on Tuesday, math homework and the computer project due on Friday. My Tissue Engineering group presentation is the following Tuesday, with a Math take home exam on the 14th two days later, then the in-class portion on the 16th. It's good that the professor for continuum basis never gives out homework. We've only taken one exam for him so far, and it was pretty easy (It took about 14 hours to do though between studying up and writing answers down clearly).

So, tonight I'm gonna go out for a little while with Sinan, Ege, Jack and whoever else to somewhere. Finally, I have some time and energy to go out between things to do for school :D"

"event","On my way home from celebrating the end of the math mid-term, i was drunkenly riding my bike home when i came across a lost pick-up truck. they asked for directions and i started to give them some when the dude asking tried to take cash from me. I had no cash, and said so, but he approached me and checked my pockets. All the while, I was thinkng of permanently blinding him by gougin out his eyes, but I decided against it and talked him out of taking my bike once he found I had no cash. During our conversation, some fat friend of his joined in the social indescretion and stomped a bike tire. 

Now, I didn't realize the tire was bent beyond use, or I would've chosen differently, but I decided to continue with helping their original problem and gave the guy that got out of the car directions, while his 'friends' abandoned him and drove away out of cowardice. he seemed normal outside the presence of his two other friends. he was aplogetic actually. So, I gave directions, and picked up my bike to carried it the rest of the way home.

What should I have done instead. Should I have chosen differently than to forgive them? I'm feeling really sad that this occured. I don't want to believe that people would be so ignorant, but it happened... they were, despite apologies.

Whatever. What's done is done and my bike tire is the only thing that was harmed. I think it's fixable so no big deal. But the choices those strangers made.. why? I'm very upset that people would behave that way after asking for directions. Perhaps I'm upset I didn't shove a key into his eye, like I want to pretend I would've chosen to do. I donno.

I'm glad I kept my reserve and gave the abandoned guy directions. I think they were caught up in the moment. that happens to retards right? what should I have done instead? Do you think the abandoned guy thought about what happened? (prolly not) fuck, I need to fix my tire now. I'm ambivalent. Should I be pissed, or happy that I dealt with it so calmly? feh"

"event","Andorra came out a month ago, but I only recently got it. I like it, but it's kind of a bummer in its underlying tone. Perhaps that's the amount of school I've had that's looming over my mood though.

I've had an exchange student living on the couch/Sam's old room since they moved out. Because Chuck and Sam moved so unexpectedly, it's been stressful finding replacements. One kid is moving in this weekend, and one other possible replacement is still up in the air. The for-sure kid seems alright, but there's something a bit off about him. For now I'm chalking it up to how sudden everything is happening.

As for the other roommate. She is a PhD from Taiwan, that'll be finishing up her work in zoology. She might not bite however, so I'm on a fence waiting for the decision.

Diane is doing fine, but money is a huge problem for her, and she may be forced to move back to her parents' place in Orlando to build savings.

With all this, and my four thousand dollar tuition this semester, plus the broken hand medical bill, I feel like an asshole, shitting my parents' cash all over the place.

I haven't had time to accomplish much in the lab, and I haven't had time to give a good effort for any homework assignments I've had. I haven't had the concentration to learn anything useful in my tissue engineering class, and I haven't written any music in a while.

But, you know, it's been rash hashana (sp?), the jewish new year, and today some hacidic kid blew a ram's horn after I said a hebrew prayer with him, and that felt pretty cool. Even before that, I was feeling good. Good in the way where you change how thing's are going for you.

On the upside of life, the soccer season starts as of Sunday am. I've made some cash on football tickets, and had some fun at the first two games. Today, I started working out with Charlie, and it'll probably become a twice a week thing, which is more time than we ever spent hanging out while he was still in the house. Soccer in general has kept me healthy, and I've been riding my bike to school and around campus as well.

The break-up with Amy is smoothing out, and I think we're actually going to come out as friends in the end. I'm not sure how I'm feeling out a new woman, since things are great right now with my focus mainly on school. And even though my homework has been shabby, I'm not actually behind in any of my classes. I feel like a balance between everything has been found in the past week, so the rest of the semester will fall into place well for me.

Andorra is really nice, to repeat myself. Sturno has been doing great things with protools and whatever other programs he has nowadays. I want the kind of soul he puts into his stuff, but now isn't the right time, I think. My head is too far into wave functons, their eigen values, properties of the del operator and regenerative tissue engineering and immunoisolation of targeted microcapsules for drug-delivery. That's life.

I want to compare it with music... how there's a substructure yu can find behind everything that's so beautiful, and equally difficult to grasp completely. It's hard to express exactly what you want to do sometimes.

Birthdays this month include Heather, Scooter, Sturno, and Jack and Sinan, who are my lab partners, that I barely get to see. I'd like to finish my work for next week this weekend, so I can relax and enjoy the celebrations with everyone. So, I need to make that happen.

For now, a shower and some linear algebra homework, then a long day tomorrow, to end with a dinner party for Geremain (the french exchange student) for the people he's met since his stay here. So... yeah. a shower."

spring break is at the end of the week, but i don't really need the break. everything is running smoothly with Amy and classes and the house. i've even found a new roomate for the outside room from my soccer team.

tv on the radio is next month, and charlie gave me his old amplifier so i can make music again (without relying on crappy headphones). also, i've been drinking a lot of cherry coke lately. though, they changed the bottle and everything, so i'm not sure if it's actually a different flavor than the original i remembered, but the new stuff's good, if it happens to be new.

i thought this semester would be more pressing than it's been. the class i'm doing worst in is the introduction class for chemical engineers, but i had the highest test grade in transport, which requires the previous as a prereq., and i'm at least in the B's in thermodynamics, which has the previous 2 as prereqs. so that doesn't make sense, except i'm lazy as fuck when things don't matter. so it kind of makes sense..

it's way past bedtime now. i have to take Amy to a test in the morning and do the bills and crap tomorrow. All that won't take long, and after the one class i have on tuesdays, i'll be pretty much done for the day.

this is stupid because i have 2 labs to do tomorrow for calc, before the review session for the test on thursday. i haven't done any of the homework in the past weeks either. i did get that med school application in after the computer deleted my first draft of the essay i was worried about, but now i have to get those pesky lettersof recommendation. aaand i've got some thing going on with a new girl who's coming back into town tomorrow. i wanna see her when she get's back, but i'm going to be dead.

"event","k, trying to organize the 2192837491837342 thoughts about why i want to be a doctor, even why i don't want to be one, or why the wants overpower the don't wants.. you get the idea. like it's wierd to say i'm good with people right? cause that's apparently not that true. i'm moreaccurately good with a few people, and the rest don't really get it or are too busy to care or something. it's probably wrong to assume(even though they want help)patients care that i'd help them.

and on that note i guess it doesn't matter if you're not good with people. does it just come down to fixing something? well, most shit can't be fixed. like, serious things that go wrong with health.. you're fucking screwed. treating a disease may just be the lesser of evils. so, is what i'll do for a living simply advise people on how to die less painfully and possibly less quickly. what's the point there, i don't want to be a yellow light, ya know. well, maybe in those situations, people do need some care. making it like a little chart.

--------- .....want extra care ...........don't give a shit
can be healed.................................(X).......
fucked .............(X)

what an ugly chart but yeah. so, assuming thats true, i get to be nice to basicly dead people, and actually help the ones that make medicine a fucking drive thru window. bah, this is getting pretty negative, what the hell was my reason i wanted to do this?

i guess i never had a good one. i do like people, like in a watching fish in a bowl way. that part of the job would fucking kick ass. that's not very charitable or humanitarian, but i'd be doing a good job for years, helping folks, and never lose the entertainment of it. so what if the end justifies the means. no one else will know, and half won't care anyhow that their problems are going to be a hobby.

but bah, nothing here is anything i'd put in my application essay.. one thing i haven't pointed out is that it is gratifying to help out. like there was this kid having a diabetic ceisure one time, and the crowd was all shocked, but i helped him down and got him a coke, which brought him around. that was cool. whenever i could decipher the med list for 96 year old patients and figure out exactly what was going on, possibly shortening the list, that's cool too. even shit like buying bums food, and holding the door open for people carrying things.. i enjoy stuff like that. i think it'd be great to go into work and make some person having a bad day, maybe feel okay for like 15 minutes. 

like that whole futile underdog battle against disease and boo boos. i'll be that crazy guy punching waves at the beach yelling at them to stop. bad example, it'd be more like putting ice on some kids stubbed finger and saying ""okay, you'll be fine, go back outside and get hurt some more"" cause everyone is a timebomb in a way. you're not gonna survive anything once you start rolling down hill. and maybe you survive the fall off the mountain road, but your car is gonna explode, but hey you were thrown far enough away, o wait wolves are gonna eat your face. no? well fuck, you have cancer anyhow, go home and die. that's what i'll be dealing with i guess. like patching an old pair of pants, so you can wear them for a bit longer.

that's the good part of medicine, that's the fun. cause really, people love thier old pairs of pants. that's what i want do do for a living. so yeah, i'd be good at that. but i still have no idea what to say to these people reading my application. i have a lot to make up for. i never was the premed sucking dick at hospitals, filing things, collecting valuable experience. most of what i've done for humanity is outside of professional bounds. like driving people home when thier too drunk to drive and stuff. i can't really throw that in there. and there's the whole, i withdrew from my final semester, and then came back and finished. that's looks bad, like i can't handle school. something like juggling school work and family while not getting laid will always go bad, but there's not way to explain that.

though, to my merit, here i am, ready to go back and try again. i have the highest grade in my postbac math class at the moment. it was never the school that got me. i hope they see that, and don't underestimate my ability. by the way, my backup plan is chemical engineering to get some grades again. but it'd be so much nicer to just get into medschool now and be on my way.

anyway, i think i can come up with something to tell them. and if this second try doesn't work out, fuck, but i'll keep it up. i've been doing really well lately. like everything is fucking gold at the moment. so if things go sour with applying, it'll just be more of the same awesome. so, hope you're doing well too if you read this far, if you didn't fuck you bwahahha, but you of course did, so way to go. have a good night"

well, in an effort to be useful, here i am in the computer lab printing out gigabillions of resumes. all the complaining about needing to find a job has caught up to my motivation. if you don't count working for my uncle kieth, that's one year unemployed. for most of it, i've had no other responsibilities. 

but the time has been nice, as you can imagine a year off would be. i used it to pursue other things i wanted done in life before moving on and working for life. but, it's to the point now where my sister is exploding with jealousy, and my parents want to disown me for being a tragedy. i don't think they understand taking time for yourself if you need it.

my mom said, ""the more time you take now, the less you have later, because you'll have to make up that time lost not working."" very true, but working just to work after sabotaging your own med school applications just to say you've been doing something was not another pointless avenue i needed to follow.

so, anyhow, time to print and get late food, and walk around the crc a bit, then call it a day. maybe i'll pick up a soccer game today, but i'm still sore from yesterday's.

also, i'll be down for the 4th and the previous weekend, so i hope we can get together and shoot fireworks at eachother."

"event","i've been drnking and writing the best love song ever written in the entire world, but maybe only because it pertains directly to me, and the things that have happened in my life. i might actually post it one day, if i can perform it well at some scummy open mic night sometime. maybe that will never happen. i don't know

tomorrow my family is meeting at my uncle keith's house for lunch. my grandpa died last week, and his funeral is on tuesday. he's been dead with alzheimer's <sp> for a while, so that doesn't bother me, but all the family does. only because of cowardice to an extent. i still don't have a job, or any meaningful excuse for how i spend my time (drunk at 4:30am on lj). it just gets tiresome explaining myself out of focus repeatedly.

there is the calculus class i'm taking for very little reason. that seems to divert a lot of attention. well, i'm gonna piss and get some sleep for tomorrow. rest hasn't been very easy lately, but i guess things have been a bit odd for a while now. for instance, i don't even know who i'm typing to at the moment. probably no one. meh, lj is therapeutic to a degree. though it's disconcerting to think my post could be passed over by a ""which spice girl are you"" internet quiz. c'mon, no one cares about the spice girls anymore. get with the times, internet

"event","my abuelo has a birthday in about a week, making him 91 or 92 or something. recently, he called my dad, who of his 3 children is the most reliable, because he thought he was peeing blood. my tia annie, his crazy daughter that ""takes care"" of him, wanted to take him to the urologist tomorrow, and my dad basically went up for support yesterday.

when he got to jacksonville, he found a mostly-empty bottle of cranberry schnaap's (does that exist?) that apperently abuelo had drank like juice. not only did he get trashed, but the intense color of the drink made him pee a little red, making him believe it was blood. upon realizing what had happened, my tia annie said, ""he was kind of drunk the other day..."" what a fucking tard she is.

so, my abuelo is ok... god knows how he got his hands on cranberry schnaap's, but he's ok. my family is hilarious

<center><img src=""http://myspace-531.vo.llnwd.net/00645/13/51/645651531_l.jpg""></center>
inspired by <a href=""http://www.abcgallery.com/C/chirico/chirico.html"">this guy</a> who does a good job of painting dusk with a very bleak style that i fucking love and recently discovered. he also likes making things in the distance huge. it's just great stuff, back to me..

at the moment, there's a cycle to my life. it's more like a tide really because everything gets done in tremendous waves that scare children and knock over old ladies in one-piece swimsuits. then there's that lull where i get sucked back into the sea and have to build up enough oomph to topple obstacles again. a lot of people work like this actually, i think it may be due to schools and how everything is divided into bits of things to do once every two or so weeks. we procrastinate for days then pull an all night do-a-thon and the reward is a grade and bloodshot eyes for a while. so far, not much has been even in my lifetime. i've had no routine of any sort to mention exept for this odd activity schedule i've been talking about.

more specificly, in the last two weeks, i've done a ton of studying and job hunting as well as shit tons of diversions and slacking off. two weeks ago from today i was getting up in the early morning and looking at the paper, or going to the carreer resource center every day. i spaced time to relax between being busy from sun up to sun down. pick-up soccer games were becoming a regular hobby and i finally got months of bills in order. the back door to gradschool didn't work out, but i still signed up for the GRE on the 17th and had been studying for it up at cafe or on the front porch during the day. then.. CRASH... receed....

now i'm up at 6AM not because i went to sleep early as i was doing, but because of one of those dumb-ass nights where you stay up doing nothing for no reason. all last week was nothing, ever since the basketball game pretty much. laundry has been piling up in the corner waiting to be done for the last few days, finally done tonight, but leaving me in a pink collared shirt and adidas shorts. lazy beards keep getting a day longer than the last, and probably worst of all, the gorgeous days of this past week have been pretty much slept through.

so why the drastic changes? is it a motivation problem? not really... i actually feel pretty good about things at the moment. it's just that my brain just shuts off and starts chasing butterflies in a field, and it takes a few days to regain focus on what's going on. i suppose if you've ever wondered why i'm mean and distant some days, and happygolucky and friendly others, it's because when i'm set on doing something, i don't like to be bothered. when i'm out to lunch, there's not much that could get me down.

so that's what i'll call it: out to lunch. the past week wasn't wasted, it was enjoyed.. immensely actually. but now i've got to get back to work for at least another small wave. i'd love an income of any kind so i can stop borrowing money from my parents, which i fucking hate. the GRE is in 6 days on monday, and i've got to finish preparing for that shit. that score isn't as important as the MCAT for me, but it'd be good to have options in case i fuck up med school admissions a second time.

so, i might as well take a nap, and start getting back to bed early again. it was good to type this out and just let my mind talk for a while.

for those of you that don't know, my birthday is this month. this year is the first year in my adult life that i haven't had a final exam or two at 7:30 in the morning. not that i usually get excited for myself, but it's going to be nice to actually relax on the bday, and maybe get a few bucks for jellybeans and kit kat bars. here, at the end of my college life, i wish i had kept in touch with more people. i suppose i've been a bit of a recluse or just shut out in some instances, but i think about most people often enough to feel like i've lost a lot of them. i do have some good core friends that are doing well though, and definately some roomates that could step it up a bit and get out of the house more, but that's an issue everyone's familiar with. 

anyway, i plan to be at the beach while it's sunny this week, looking at math and hard words, reading comics and classifieds and net fishing. anyone reading this is welcome to join me out there, but i understand most of you have your shit that you do as well, and it seems all important and too far from the beach. so good luck, enjoy the rest of the week, and i'll see you at some point, i'm sure.

ps - sorry joe, for the loud <a href=""http://plaza.ufl.edu/kaligamo/yeeeeaaaaaahhhhh.mp3"">yeeeeaaaaaahhhhh.mp3</a> song at 3AM over there. i figure i'll explain the joke since you actually listened. it's basically a song about TV and my interpretation of its message to us. sam and i often use it to make fun of ridiculously over-energetic things, and in some cases for extreme sarcasm. so enjoy it, may it continue to be used well. good night"

"event","whenever i write these things, i realize that i'm really talking to myself. after a few sentences or paragraphs it gets old, so it gets deleted. one thing though.. i have so much to do and no concentration.

all i ate today was fried chicken and hot tomales. charlie and i spent six hours shopping for a heating/cooling wall unit for his outside room. his heating element broke and he's been sleeping in three to four layers of clothes for the past few freezing nights.

other retarded things include me not having a job or a focus on school. i just do nothing all day somehow. nothing productive. now it's 6am and this is my last ditch effort for accomplishment. the only real goals achieved recently have been musical.

i went to some casey's party on saturday after eating birthday dinner for jill, then i stole a microphone from a show i went to because the 7 jello shots kicked in and i was drunk. sunday i cut seventeen different songs into small sound bits and started sequencing them into a remix of an entire album from here:

http://www.peppermillrecords.com/projects/

monday at 9 am i went to speak with a professor of biomedical engineering, and he told me my effort was laughable. i sat around all day and went to tampa that night with heather and charlie to meet joe and see nile. the roads there are terrible and we got fucked out of a lot of gas. 

tuesday... i have no recollection

wednesday, all i know is that someone put out the trash on tuesday. we will have that day solved at this rate of feverish detection. refer to above for the rest of wednesday. also, i saw a woman living out of her car peeing in a parking lot and drinking a forty simultaneously. that made me think about if she'd ever thought she'd be doing that like even five years ago. 

so, it's febuary. i have no idea what i've done past this weekend. nothing sticks out but habit changes. slowly i've been staying up later and later, playing guitar and hanging out with the roomates watching mindless cartoons. during the days i get excercise and try to remember to feed myself.

i really wanna start being awake during the day though. i miss all that potential activity i could be doing. for example, i went up to cafe for rice and beans and a beer the other day, or maybe weeks ago, and that was fun hanging out with hanuman, andrea and natalie. we did the crossword puzzle to the best of our combined ability and conquered and handful of vague clues.

anyway, i think i should eat now. that's probably got something to due with my lack of concentration. i even catch myself not breathing while spacing out sometimes. it's kind of ridiculous to remind yourself to breath, but it's ok. so far no fatalities.

i just remembered the calzone i recently ate, i can't believe 1. that i forgot about that and 2. that i'm still hungry. 

3. why am i awake?

while i'm at  it 4. why am i typing at livejournal?

bah whatever, if you're jubilantly bored and need something to do, perhaps these compact separate paragraphs are providing distraction from the nothing you'll have to do once you're done reading. aw, if you made it this far, sorry i'm done now.

other than music,i've been going out with heather a lot more. actually going to ladies nights and what not. we always split up eventually then meet up to tell tales of the horriblepeople in this town. it's fun as shit. well more fun than shit. anyways, i have a lot todecide on soon. already febuary. it's crazy how i'vepretty much done nothing for about a year. crazy and great.

"event","so, i get confused about what order to do things in, then end up doing nothing. a list of things might help.

write e-mails to schools, apologizing for being a tard
look into random graduate school programs
maybe actually take the gre
finish my resume and e-mail it to my aunt linda
  then get an ops job at shands for the rest of the year
keep the house relatively clean, i've been doing well so far this year
fix my speakers
work together with ryan to actually make some music
look into late spring work study programs in guatemala and shit
continue to not drink soda. as for beer, i was good until this past weekend
  but i think i can keep down beer consumption from now on. it's less addictive than soda
continue to cook for myself. ording food gets expesive.
keep writing music, without the ability to record it.i have another song recently finished actually
it'd be nice to influence charlie to follow his new years resolutions;
   get him out of the house to meet people.


overall, i want to be doing something, i need a bit of money to sustain myself. I'm really regretting procrastinating (more because of apprehension than sloth) about getting into med school. it's almost all i think about now, how much i want to be swamped with information no one could possibly learn in such a short time. i get excited thinking about that. i can't wait to actually get the m.d. someday. 

   in retrospect, i've made a lot of good decisions so far. it feels like i fucked up a lot because I'm not doing much now, but it has been a good few months otherwise, even if i haven't moved forward career-wise. how do you spell career? i don't know. i feel much more sane now. i guess months of time off can help with that. anyway, that list isn't bad. i'd better get started."

- friends are great. scott's show, random parties, couch crashing, beaching or just sitting around the house. thanks for the sanity that's been restored these past few weeks.

- here at the end of the list: priorities


the past:
- birthdays, kickball, dinners, traveling, pool golf, people leaving, people coming back, marriages, disengagements, 25 cent beers, crashing on the couch for a few days, art, music, clubs, soccer, spanish, japanese, patients, driving, working, lakehouses, applications, degrees, MCAT scores, cooking, cleaning, drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking, and drinking

the future:
- settle the fuck down, then go to miami to party for a week. get back and start EMT training. run around the state in my free time and balance girl and a small job. try to make some fucking music again, and keep on keeping on.

now, i've gotta go in there tomorrow morning and sort this all out. they can't just mail shit like that two days before a deadline and expect everyone to be happy. so wish me some luck dealing with them. i feel a catch 22 coming on.

fucking fuckers

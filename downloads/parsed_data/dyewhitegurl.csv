I hang out with Frances alot cause we're sort of on the same page for alot of things. I'll miss her when she moves on to college. 
I miss Tara Lynn Callighan. It's been so long since I've been able to see her. We're both so busy and caught up in our own lives. Hopefully our plans will not diminsh for tomorrow night. I'm excited. I haven't really been out of the house since I got out here. Well...I must continue to do my schoolwork and that means that I must go."

I haven't been able to update due to the fact that there is no real internet in St. James City. I have no car and barely any clothes. My mother won't even give me my cat. She's planning to turn my room into an office. My dad's cooler than shit though. I just always feel like I have to take care of him. 
David dumped me. He claims that I don't love him anymore and I'm getting too into drugs!! That son-of-a-bitch is worse than I am. Partially due to Ashley being back and she gets everyone into trouble. He doesn't realize that she's a gold digger and uses people for evrything. She's hopeless and I give up!!
I'll probably get fired cause I forget when I have to work due to the chaos in my head.
But things shall get better.
I miss everyone that I usually talk to. I miss Tara. I hope u had a grand birthday and I'm deeply sorry that I couldn't attend the dinner on Monday. I'm sure it was good. Tell ur mom I really miss her spagetti.
Well, I must go put my life back together."

"event","Started classes on Wednesday. Government and Economics will be pretty average. But Mass Communtications and Comp 1 will be a different story. If you watch Winktv news at 5. There is a goofy segment called ""Cribb's notes"". Thast guy is my professor for mass comp. I might finally learn something about journalism. My comp professor likes to write about religion and politics. This will be interesting. I think he's gay.
All in all, Edison seems just like high school yet with more freedom and older people. I feel so young. I'm probably the youngest kid there. I felt better once I saw Monica and Cynthia in my gov. class.
I will be visiting Mariner sometime next week. I need to get some scholarship apps and figure out my NHS. So I might see some peeps~"

I don't see David much either cause he's an idiot who crashed his car...(well his dad's), so no veichle nor a job. I'm sick of him being such a deadbeat lately. It's just not like him. The only thing he wants to do anymore is get stoned. He's been so distant too. It's wierd.
Right now I'm waiting on my dad to come get me so that we can hang out. He's always either late or a no show.
I had to put Ashley back on the bus Sunday and It hurts everytime. The day was shitty too. Saturday night Frances came over and brought some drinks. The next morning Ash vomitted ALOT! We pulled up to the station to watch the bus pull away. My mom bitched pissed and moaned as always. Ashley is moving back over this weekend. Finally after 2 years of waiting. I hope people didn't think she was too crazy. But the people at the show were a bunch of assholes anyway. Most of them were so stuck up I thought thier noses would begin to bleed.
I miss my friends. I still love my Tara Lynn."

He got fired from Tire Kingdom after only a week. He just drinks and smokes with his friends. I hope he dosen't end up a loser cause then he definately won't end up with me.
Ashley went home this weekend on homepass and for some reason she's back for good. She is supposed to be coming over this weekend so hopefully I will see her and beat the shit out of her too.

She's giving Gary (my stepdad) shit too...She thinks he's cheating on her, but personally, I don't know if any other woman would want to actually sleep with him.
        I saw Coheed & Cambira!! They're almost better live. Claudio is INSANE with the guitar. God that man is talented!!!!!!!!!!! And just for Tara, I did our little interpretive dance moves to the lyrics. (Call me if ur free saturday night)

I'm sure that everyone have heard about the lost girl Anna and that they found her body. I knew her, worked with her, went to school with her too. People are just so sick. It's disturbing. The two killers are in custody, a 16 year old kid was one of them. After they killed her, they put her body in a refrigerator and then burned her body unrecognizable. It's just fucking sick.
R.I.P Anna

Oh well...Tara should be coming home tomorrow. It feels like I haven't seen her in forever. God dammit I miss hanging out with my friends. I got to see Matt, Beau, and Ryan one night after work but that was about it. I doubt it will change cause I work about 30 hours next week. That's alot for me.
I signed up for Edison and registared for classes for the fall semestar. I will no longer have to attend God forsaken Mariner! I'm excited yet scared all at once. It's a new chapter for me to write.
Ashley is back in rebah. I feel as if I can finally exhale. Hopefully my letters will be encouraging to her. I wish her the best of luck. She's my lil' sis.
Daytona with my Dad was absolutely fantastic. He never did neither Goldschlager (sp?) nor Jeggurmiester (again sp?) so we were throwin back shots. He got shot in the face with a bottle rocket and one of his friends shot one between his legs. Thank god he was taking a piss so that he could put it out. I got a couple burns that are kinda infected and hurt like hell.
I was supposed to be in New Jersey but darn it was cancelled. I miss everyone so hopefully I can hang out soon!!"

"event","Alright I gotta write about the My Chemical Romance show. It was....FUCKING AWESOME!!! I could die one happy bitch. Tara and I arrived around 4 but some people had been there since 9 in the freakin morning! All of a sudden...the line began to move. People began to rush forward and jump to the front. Tara grabbed my hand and we rushed in. Just 30 minutes before the doors were to open this old bitch starting yelling at us and telling us to get to the back of the line. I wanted to punch out that old hag but Tara, being the people person she is, smoothed it over and got her to shut up. We made friends with the people around us so when the line began to flow trough the doors they made a barracade behind us and we took off to the front.It was a beautiful show. Gerard is georgeous. There was an openind band and they were quite impressive.It was a chick singer half my size and I was expecting just some singing but then she screamed. Tara and I just looked at in each other in awe. I never caught their name but they were good.
Afterwards we we drenched in sweat and just jumped into this founatin thing. It was all good stuff.
That night I got kinda fucked up and we went to Dennys at 2 am. Right before we were going to leave, my stepsister and her boyfriend busted in pissass drunk. He's a Lee County Sheriff. You would NEVER expect it just by meeting him.He is a crazyass and very entertaining mind you.
The next day we went to Islands of Adventure. I had never been there but it was really fun. We got drenched on one of the rides nd changed in the parking lot.lofl.
When I had to take Chet home (sis b/f) We passed Ryan, Matt, and Beau. Matt and Beau were...well if u know them then u know wht I mean. Being the pervs that they are...they thought that I was giving Chet raod head. I so happy they think that I would do that. I'm not that slutting. Jesus Christ. That kinda pisses me off. Especially since Ryan thinks that. I...nevermind. I can't wait to hang out with him tonight.
Today I went to Edison to sign up for fall semester. I shall be doing full time dual enrollment next year. I'll only be going to school Monday Tuesday and Wednesday from 8-12. How fuckin sweet is that?!?!?!?! 
Tomorrow my Dad and I are going to Daytona for the races. I love hanging with him. He's the coolest person in the world. I will be back Sunday and then I will write another big ass entry about how drunk my dad and I got."

I just got off the phone with David. He's freakin out. One minute he wants to at least be friends and the next he can't handle it. It's starting to piss me off. He wants to get back together so desperately and I feel that being apart right now may be for the best. We both need to sort out personal issues within ourselves.I just can't do it anymore.
Tara Lynn has a massive flesh eating disorder on her neck. That's all I'm going to say. I still love her though.

      Well now the days of summer have not been that glamourous. I have worked nearly everynight untill 11:30. Yipee!!! My days off are usually booked too. 
SIX DAYS UNTILL MY BIRTHDAY!!! WAHOO!!
MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE IN 12 DAYS!!!!! WHOOP WHOOP!!
Everyone must already know about my dear fucked up friend Ashley. She moved to West Palm Beach two years ago. Everything has been downhill for her ever since. About 6 months ago she was arrested and put on a juvinille probation program. Then she fucked up and was then placed in a rehabilitation program for 90 days. On her 46th day, she decided to run away with another girl in the program. At 8:30 yesterday morning she called me from some guys phone. She is stranded up in Orlando. She was supposed to call me once she got to a Greyhound bus station so that I could send her a ticket. Last night she never called to tell me what was going on. I fear for her. I hope she is okay. I wish I could bring her to live with me, clean her up, get her a job, and put her ass back in school. She's only 16!!!!! But first I would beat the living shit out of her. If she would have stayed in rehab then she would have gotten a fresh start once she returned home. Now it's fucked up. If she's caught then she will be arrested. I feel obligated to make sure she's okay and figure things out for her. I feel like the one who shattered her innocence in the first place.
I would like to send my deepest, sincerest apologies to Andrew the Mandrew. The comments about Tara and Dan were only meant to mean a new friendship. That's it so I'm sorry if it seemed like more. I love ya Andrew!!
Ryan is still sick and I feel terrible about it. I HATE hearing sick people. Now Tara is falling ill. I guess I'll be next! But I hope not cause I can't afford to be sick. 
Tonight I'm going to hang out with one of the coolest people on earth...my Dad. I'm taking him out for Father's Day since I have to work on Sunday. (A little reminder to everyone...Dad's day is Sun the 19th) 
David and I are just friends. It's an okay situation. He says that he can't live without us at least being friends. So the least I can do for him is settle for a friendship. It will be hard but hopefully the right thing to do."

I saw some of Davids friends. They were blazed out of thier minds!!! (Note to Tara: Todd cut his hair!! It's an emo cut with a frickin blonde streak in the front! But nothing males him unattractive.) It was disappointing. His new tattoo looks awesome though. It's a 3/4 sleve (sp?) tribal. I'm not one for tribal but it look great. He got it done at Pleasures in Ft. Myers. Aaron rocks. He's 28 but looks 16! lofl
I'm really happy that I've started reading books again. It's been so long since I've been able to just pick up a book and read it at a leisurely pace and actually enjoy it. I didn't realize how much I loved reading. Wow! I'm a dork!!!!
I've been in such a wierd mood lately because of everything that has been going on. If u don't know everything already then just don't ask. Read some other enteries.
I feel like Tara, my one friend in the world right now, is avoiding me and doesn't even want to hang out with me. Well maybe not that but just annoyed or sick of me because I seem to be clinging to her.It's quite the shitty feeling. But I guess I don't need anyone anyway."

David and I may never speak again and I believe that this time is for real. Saturday I told him that I don't want anything right now. He took it very hard. Evryone knows how much he has been smothering me. He then preceded to tell me that he wants to kill himself. He likes to play this game where he closes his eyes for 10 seconds while hes driving. WHAT AN IDIOT! I told him that I was not going to blame myself for his death. When I said that a feeling of independence and strength came over me. I know it sounds dramatic but it's true.
Poor Ryan!!! He's so sick. Whenever a friend of mine falls ill, I feel bad about it as if I gave it to them. On the phone I hear him hacking and coughing and it just breaks my heart. So sorry Ryan...I know that strep throat blows. 
Tara has begun an interesting relationship with a certain someone named DAN. DAN DAN DANDANDA DAN. DAN DAN DA DA DA DAN!!! (that was for Tara Lynn)I'm glad that she is enjoying her time with him. Unfortunately, we both know that it will soon turn complicated because of a dicknose named Greig. (I won't give him a cool name song) Oh well...as long as she is happy. I think a great solution to the problem would just kill Greig!!! We'll see what happens."

Although David and I have parted ways...He still shows up around my work.He claims that he was ""just in the area"" even though he know lives out near Alva. I know things are awkward for him but I just treat him like a really great friend. I miss some things about him like his scent and his eyes but I will let go. Thnks to Tara Lynn Calligan, I'm having a good time and healing at the same time.
I went to Andrews wonderful party tonight. I showed up straight from work in my lovely Publix uniform. Everyone got a kick out of it. Maybe people will remember me by that. I'm talking to Tara as I type this update. I guess after I left Andrews, he kicked everyones asses out!!! Damn! You go boy!At least I got to see the wonderful Alex Arkoosh. Tara and I must hang out with him on Sat.
Well... tonight wasn't bad considering I had to work but next week I have to work late and long ass hours. That might change soon becuase tomorrow, Tara and I are going down to the resturaunt Mr.C's to pick up apps for a hostessing (sp?) job. Matt and Beau work there so it might actually be kinda fun. I dunno. I still have to decide wheather or not to go to Edison full-time next year. Damn, I've got alot of thinking to do!
I thought I didn't have much to say, but now that I've poured part of my heart out...I will bid the night farewell and go to bed."

"event","This weekend has been so fun!!!It was pretty much fanastic from fri to mon when I had to come home to the pits of firey hell. Tara and I got so fuckin wasted!!! It was insane!!! Anyone who wasn't there missed one hell of a time. Well we thought it was a good time.;)
David didn't dare show his face. He did leave me a pathetic sad card that made me cry.
Yep...I had the time of my life until I came home. Being at my dads house brings me such peace and happiness which makes me realize how shitty I feel when I'm at home with my fucked-up mom and stepdad.
I found out about what happened to my dear friend Ashley. She was sent to rehab and should be back in a month or so. I love her like a sister and hope everything is okay."

"event","well..it's 1:40 thurs night. I skipped out on work tonight to hang with a shit load of peeps. Had an okay time but making money might haomorrowve been better. tomorrow Tara and I are going to my dads in bumfuck to set up for the shindig. It should he a good time.
David and I had a complete break up tonight. I had to make a decision on whether or not to be with him for good. He saw me laughing with Tra and said that he wanted me to be happy and told me to call him if I needed him and then just...left. Tjats it I guess. So,,knowing all that, the party should be great. 
well if you can't tell my mood...."

"event","It's been a while since I had a chance to update this thing. School ended and I think I totally bombed the last exam which was Spanish. Tara threw papers out the window and then we went to enjoy a delicious lunch. 
Friday I washed my car after a 6 month dirt build up. I picked up Paul and he helped me with it while mexicans were standing around and laughing at me. Well...he pretty much did it all while Tara and I stood and watched...the mexicans still laughed.Friday night I told David I would be with him for his last evening here. He picked me up at 8 and then dropped me back off at 9:30!!!To go hang out with his friends!!! I was pissed. I called up Tara to come get me and then chilled with her and Andrew the Mandrew untill about 2 am.My mom was a little freaked. But good timing Andrew! Ur the man. I hope ur show went well!
This weekend at work we get to dress up as cowboys!! Well a cowgirl in my case. It's fun and I don't have to wear that pitiful polyester uniform. 
David moved to Lehigh yesterday. I wasn't gunna go to his house but then a song came on that spurred me to go. I missed him by 5 min. His mom and sister were there but of course they never told him I was there. I told a certain someone that I wouldn't be so melancholy, so I'll shut up about David.:(
On a better note!> My party in next weekend!!!June 4th everyone!!! It should be a good time be cause my Dad is an awesome guy and my mom won't be there cause she's really lame. Hopefully everyone will get along (Tara!)No fighting...Bring out ur Hippie side.
Tara just got the My Chemical Romance tickets for June 27th!!!! Wahoo..Hard Rock Cafe here we come. It's an MTV taping so if anyone sees two girls raping Gerard..It's definitely me and Tara. 
My moms family is over from the eastcoast. My crazy aunt (shes crazier than my mom!) my other aunt and uncle, their two kids and my grandmother. The kids are 6 and 4. They're very cute and my mom LOVES kids. This whole time she's been completely stressed and just throwing everything on me. Yesterday she woke me up freakin out telling me to go grocery shopping. Now I have to do the laundry and clean up the disastrous kitchen they left behind to go on the frickin boat.
I must go now to play the glorious role of Cinderella. I am waiting for a Prince Charming to take me away to a ball. But I don't want to go to a ball...so maybe a could concert or somethin. Anywho ha... I'm going to shut up!"

"event","Took my first final today, Anatomy and it was surprisingly..a bit difficult. But it will be all over on thurs....I'm out! David and I are trying to work on things but the things aren't working as I've hoped. I guess the problem is that I'm a spoiled brat and just want everything!Gave out invites for my party on june 4th...if u didn't get one then come anyway(i.e. Frances)It will be a kick ass time at my dads place out in bumfuck. I should probably go cry myself to sleep over David and face the day tom. Thank god it's a half day but I have to work:( Nighty night"

"event","Well...school is almost over and thank god for that. I think that is what has been on everyones mind lately. I have so much shit to do and no time to do it in. On top of it all..David and I are in the middle of a hard break-up and I don't appreciate it.One minute we're talking and it seems like we're together, then the next minute I horrible and it's all my fault that we're not working out. It's really fucking with my emotions and mind.
I'm in the healing process. If anyone knows of anything that is going on Friday night lemme know. Tara and I have nuthin to do!!! Someone entertain us!!!!"

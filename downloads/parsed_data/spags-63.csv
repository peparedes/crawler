"event","So I've been here for a week now.  It's been good.  I've not been here.

Touring Choir was rehearsal and performed in Wheeling WV, which needless to say is a lovely 4 hours spend in a bus per day.  Tiresome, yet awesome.  An die Freude will be forever stuck in my head.  Awesome awesome times were had by all.

I like my classes, I've not had my seminar yet, but I'm thinking I'll like it--so long as I can get through the readings with some basic understanding.  Everything else is great.  Yeah.  Really can't complain scholastically about this semester-particularly compared to last when I had 3 ""real courses"" as I like to call them.

Hm.  Now being not here much during the week meant that I spent uber time with Julie this weekend.  Saturday was ""we're hungry, let's eat"" then ""it's nice out, let's walk"" followed by, ""let's be academically productive in one another's company"" therefollowed ""scarf down dinner"" and culminated in my first attempt at Ice Skating.  Yes, as my parents have feared, I looked something akin to a monkey out there, it being my first time and all.  It ended up being ok, my pride remained unbruised, and surprisingly so did my bum.  I didn't fall once, though I came close a few times.  Had to change skates because they don't have half-sizes...i managed to squeeze into a pair of 8's.  Julie was very supportive.  My left leg needs to be fixed in some manner if I'm ever to find my way on an ice rink again.  Grr to ankles that don't allow the foot to balance directly over the blade.  That evening was concluded with Eat & Park fun times...including breaded zucchini.

Church this morning was good--I'm in a sort of phase of spiritual renewal that was very much helped by that...I'm hoping to remain diligent to that end.  Brunch was...brunch.  I then practiced piano for 90 minutes whilst Julie switched between practicing trumpet and reading for Russian History.  We then went on another walk, ate dinner, watched Cinderella Man (broken noses...hehe) and enjoyed meeting other couple-friends in West.  And now here I am.

Yeah, this has been a very...socially active weekend...and by socially active I imply that said social activity revolved basically around Julie.  Yeah...I almost feel bad for Laura and Jen for stealing their roommate from them.  Oh well.

I'm tired--i'm gonna go to bed.

"event","Well, the old dog is at it again.  Technical support at your service.

Today I purchased a Sony Vaio desktop with a Pentium D processor :-D and an Epson printer/scanner/copier.  The most money i've spent in a day (though technically it wasn't mine)

Yay for rebates, but those will be a while...now onto purchasing  a digital camera and a wireless network card (which wasn't included in the sony...grrr)

In other news, I visited Julie all of last week...flying down thurs dec 29 was incredibly...complicated.  Due to weather, my first flight was delayed...which would've made me miss my connecting flight, but that also ended up being delayed...which due to its laterness caused Mr. O'Roark to have to abandon a shopping cart in the supermarket in order to pick me up on time.

Meeting the family was nice--they seemed to like or at least tolerate me quite well.  I've decided that I need a better answer to ""so what do you want to do with music and history?""  but yes, pleasant.  Also pleasant was meeting and hanging out with the WaHo crew. Despite Caroline asking the question ""do you have any d-batteries?""

Other highlights:  cooking, de-christmasing the house, going to the Modern Art museum, being ignored at Ruby Tuesday's, almost losing to Julie in chess, actually losing to Julie in boggle, ""Hello Clarice,"" New Years w/ WaHo crew, Brewer's ""Birthday"" party at Miyako's, Producers, M. Night Shyamalan fun times, The Little Mermaid, and of course, just plain spending time with her.  :-D

I like how we don't hate each other even after having spent pretty much an entire week with one another.

So yeah...if there's anything I've missed...oh well.

"event","Yes dear reader.  I've again gone back on my word of not using LJ much.  And why?  I dunno.  Just sort of felt like it.

I'm currently sitting in a chair.  (duh)... In Pittsburgh Intern'l Airport, waiting for my flight.

Finals are over, semester's over...and so much has happened.
Not the least of which has been getting to know (and now date) Julie.  Scarcely does a day go by when I don't thank God for her presence in my life.  We spent roughly 5 hours with each other last night--went out to Sun Gin for a celebratory ""finals are over"" dinner...which doubled as a walk...and then found a free spot in West Lobby to watch Shrek 2...and Derek Jacobi (yay brother cadfael!)...this morning we had breakfast together at far-too-early-in-the-morning for one last goodbye before break.

We're so sad, it's wonderful.  For example, while I planned on napping in the car on the way to the airport--every moment of attempted napping was spent rather missing her, thinking fondly on all that has transpired over the past few months, etc.

I brought her christmas card along with me--and have read it for the...i think 7th time by now (cumulative).  I continually find myself moved to tears (on the inside) by it.  I love this girl so much.

(There, I've typed it.)

Funny unrelated story--this was the first time that I was randomly searched--i must've looked particularly like a terrorist today or something.  (must be the sneakers?)  After *LAURA* talked about her always being searched yesterday after getting the evil glare from the notebook-mover yesterday.

Speaking of Laura, I wonder how getting her flight transfered to me is going...  So that I can go to Baltimore and visit, yes you guessed it, Julie.  Laura's awesome.  I'm glad we're friends, regardless of that fact that I'm dating her roommate.  But yes--Laura, very helpful, very fun, overall a very good friend.

I'm sort of at a loss for writing anything else...i suppose I could update my Xanga saying the same thing...but i dunno.  for all its frilly bells & whistles in format, I'm tempted to revert to livejournal for simplicity's sake.

It's been a good semester.  I'm looking forward to this next one.
That is all.

Well, it's been a while since i've updated--i've had myself a great winter break--had fun throughout, had a good christmas, new years, etc.

And probably the most fun i've had at home ever.  (Or at least since the summer)

So now comes the time where spags thinks about going back to college this sunday :-\
In a way, it'll be a good thing for me.  I have a great schedule, good friends there that i miss, and now i'm a music major :-)

And hopefully i'll be able to straighten out my silly emotional roller coaster ride too.

Bah to my silly heart that wants what it can't have."

What Does Your Name Mean?</a>

So you ask me, ""Spags, why are you doing that?""  And I respond ""cause i'm bored.""
You then remind me ""but Spags, you have a gagillion things to do this week, so why are you sitting on your unproductive arse?""
To which I retort, ""because it beats looking at YOUR FACE!!!!""  ohhhhh!!!!

No seriously, there is so much I should be doing right now.  Far too much.  To the point where my head is swimming.  I've slept in and taken 2 naps today in prep for a mammonth evening of paper writing.  *sighs*

Yep, lots to do, never the time to do it.  Plus I'm auditioning to join the music department here at GCC and get a second major out of it this saturday @ 11:30am.  Ugh.

In all actuality, I feel prepared for it, but now i've got this tickle in the back of my throat which is getting me paranoid.  Cause if that audition doesn't go well--i'm screwed.

Oh well--God's hands, I know.  Oh, recently was guest conductor for GospelTeam--that was fun.
Discovering Trekkies left and right--also fun.
Not doing as much work as I should--only fun for the first five minutes.
So yeah, i've sort of exiled myself from AIM to get more work done and be less unproductive.  That's really done not much for me--although i have gone on for some important issues regarding my return voyage to connecticut.  I dunno, i also can't help but feel crabby as well.  Were this more regular, I'd swear that men do have PMS as well--but such is not the case with me, thankfully. :-)

I miss home--a lot more than i thought i would.  I like it here, and socially things are quite happy here, but i dunno.

Ok, i need to find myself dinner and then jet to orchestra

Spags out for now."

For those of you who actually read this, my apologies for not ""really updating"" *cough, kathleen, cough* in forever.  :-)

Ok, so...stress, my life, the two are the same.  Sure, it's tough all over, everybody else is swamped with work, etc.  And my object here is not to complain, but merely to express and perhaps enlighten myself to the complex workings that are my thoughts here and now.

so, flowery language aside...

Tonight was the Orchestra concert--went pretty well, at least i thought so...as far as orchestra concerts go and such.  No rehearsal tuesday, woot!  Touring Choir was a real plus today--everything seemed to click after a bit, Dr. Browne actually was pleased with our sound...something which I haven't heard him say in like...weeks.  Plus dinner at McDonalds with DV, Lynn, and Jonny which was cool cause let's just say i'm not the biggest fan of butternut squash.  (You would think Bon Appetit would get their ecclesiastical calendar correct and realize that lent is in the SPRING SEMESTER...meat on friday is a perfectly acceptable diet at this point in time--profs to those who get that--extra profs if you're not catholic yet still get that!)  So that was a good end to the week.

I have the monster of all CivArts tests awaitning me monday though.  In the words of Jess, ""This test is going to rape me.""  Yes.  Yes it is.  This weekend is rather um...shot thanks to it.  I also have thousands of pages to read for history which i've had to put off that i need to make a dent in.  Add to that a Physics test on wednesday on material that i only barely know.  And then the real kicker: registration.

I decided I needed to talk with Dr Browne again.  I talked with him last year about this time about what it would entail to be a music major, but chickened out basically.  Didn't wanna rock the boat or anything, wanted to get situated as a freshman and all.  The more i think about it though, the more I realize how much of a passion I have for music--which does indeed rival my passion for history and those sorts of intellectual endeavors which my current major has me involved in.  Well, technically--there are still enough credit hours left to double major...i'd be hard pressed, overworked, and possibly unhappy, but I could do it.  Downside: i'd have to double up on lessons, not to mention audition, not to mention juries, student recitals, senior recitals, etc... all of which i find daunting.  So I found on pg 58 of the Bulletin, the ""Interdisciplinary Major"" option, which my current grades qualify me for.  I would basically ""make up"" a major--mixing music and history.  Cause let's face it--my 2 major career plans are a) teaching, or b) preaching.  So either way, a foundation of history and music would be beneficial.  (I could attempt to get double certified as far as education is concerned--be more marketable and such...and history would help me prepare for seminary, plus it helps to be musically acquainted in a church that uses music to praise God).  It makes sense...but will it work?

I have a meeting tuesday, right smack dab in the middle of my tests.  Therein lies my fate.  I really really really hope they let me, but even if they do, I need to get it cleared by Dr Harp and Dr Arnold, the latter of which I've never spoken to.  Odds are, the music department would want me to audition (as a voice concentration)...trouble is, I have no reportoire outside of like...show choir stuff.  And the 1/4 year of voice lessons I took in high school.  So...will that cut it?  I don't know.  And what's worse--registration is on Nov 11...so I'm running out of time here.  I've got less than a couple weeks to get this done, and I'm feeling the pressure.

I dunno.  And in all honesty, part of my desire to go through with this...or ""worst case"" to attempt a double major...stems from associating so much with the music majors here in GCC.  Honestly, I've felt so...at home when I hang out with them folks in Pew.  I feel so...welcome...i don't know how to put it.  I was always an orch-dork in high school and would hang with the bandos and such...to some extent maybe it's just me feeling comfortable with the same sort of crowd.  Maybe it's just me trying to find some place to fit in.  Cause frankly, i'm sick of being a social outcast, which is how i lived like 14 years of my life.  Sure, high school did a lot to change that for me, and college as well.  Even this year, I feel such a difference compared to like prior semesters.  There's a level of confidence I have now that I lacked before, which before was nothing greater than shyness and inhibition.  I at last feel like I have a definite interdependent existence--something I honestly have missed for the past year.

Last of all, ever since the Touring Choir retreat, I've felt a great sense of peace.  Alot like Emmaus and what that would do to uplift my spirit.  I'll be the first to admit that in the midst of all this chaos, it's easy to lose track of what's important in life...  And stil I need to focus more of my effort on prayer and study of the Word, but as of late I've felt much more complete.  On the eve of going back to college, when I did some soul searching...finally coming to terms with some of the self imposed barriers that have impeded my development and clouded my vision.  Most specifically, the whole love life thing.  When i was dumped in high school (only had 1 gf-went our for a little over a year--- just to clarify), it hurt.  Significantly--like i was crying on the drive home type of thing.  Well, cry a river, build a bridge and get over it i told myself, which is what i thought i did.  And it seemed to work.  But in the midst of that, looking back I wonder if I was really just isolating and insulating myself from the hurt of loving and losing.  And i don't know...but after like, 2 years or whatever, i finally revisited that thought, and basically resolved to let myself just be...trusting in God that in His time, my day shall come.

So yeah.  Waiting on the Lord there... may I have the patience to remain so, and the wisdom to discern what to do when that time comes--be it in 2 days, 2 years, 2 decades."

"event","<P>Yet another update...</P>
<P>Saturday, I was rained out of work...surprise surprise.&nbsp; Quite the interesting thunderstorm I must say.&nbsp; Of course, it didn't help that I was finishing my sermon as well...hehe...</P>
<P>Ah, my mom was probably ready to kill me.</P>
<P>For those interested, it is available on tape ;-)</P>
<P>And so, sunday, did it, went well, then attempted to perform tech support on <lj user=""lawrenr"" /> 's laptop.</P>
<P>Yeah, yet another hard drive corruption.&nbsp; I swear, laptops are the devil's work.&nbsp; :-P</P>
<P>Speaking of which, I had to ship mine off to Grove City because it decided to crash a few times here...so, got a new hard drive, and updated memory (there was a recall *shrugs*) and will pick it up once all the silly freshmen have got their tablet pc's picked up.</P>
<P>The went to work, 1-8:15 or so.&nbsp; Ok day, nothing special.&nbsp; Got home, put up away message, sat down watching ""D-Day to Berlin"" on the History Channel...proceeded to fall asleep...woke up for Command Decisions: Waterloo...i was doing regarding what courses of action to take (ie, stack dead french bodies for defensive purposes..hehe)...fell asleep again.&nbsp; Then finally, with 0 messages from 0 people, called it a night.</P>
<P>And so here I am.&nbsp; Made copies of the tape o/t sermon...and am waiting for 2pm when my dad and I and a couple others head out for the BIG SHEA.&nbsp; Mets baseball at its finest: meaning I'm going to watch them lose again.&nbsp; *shrugs* oh well.</P>
<P>Returning to the grove on the 28...where has all the time gone...&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; I'm pretty happy to go back...but I'm surprisingly more melancholy leaving this year than last year.&nbsp; Honestly can't put my finger on it.&nbsp; Hmm.</P>
<P>Anyway, that's about it.&nbsp; Oh and if your name rhymes with Larry Kwah, feel free to yell at me in any of a number of venues.</P>
<P>Until next I type</P>"

"event","<P>Some of you may be asking where I've been for the past month...<BR>To answer your question: the same place i was for the prior months.<BR>Only...unmotivated.<BR>*sheepish grin* sorry.</P>
<P>Ok...so what has happened since July 10</P>
<P>*blink*</P>
<P>that's about it... hehe</P>
<P>Ok for real.&nbsp; Since my memory is shot, these are in no particular order whatsoever.</P>
<P>Soulfest 2004 (Jul 29 - Aug 1) up in Lincoln NH at Loon Mountain.&nbsp; Great times, went as a ""chaperone"" to the youth group, to see I had the (mis)fortune of climbing up the ski trail with 1 poland springs bottle... ugh... but it was a fun experience, and ended up getting a cross at the top to remember the experience by.&nbsp; Hold on, getting technical now (scanning cross for all to see :-D)<BR>(be afraid, be very afraid)</P>
<P>At some point I went with <lj user=""eekers1120"" />&nbsp; to see M Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"".&nbsp; Meh, ok, but not as good as his prior work imho.&nbsp; Paled in comparison to Signs (as the 3 note soundtrack plays in my head).&nbsp; Saw the 3rd Inuyasha movie that same day.&nbsp; Hmm...</P>
<P>Every now and then, I've been going to my grandparent's house, helping them mow their lawn (cause they're both in their 80s and not in terrific health, so :-\)&nbsp; In fact, was there tuesday of this week, then wednesday went with them to see George Gershwin Alone at the Hartford Stage, followed by mass hysteria as big dan (or is it little dan ;-) j/k lol) eekers, and phillips crashed, splashed water out of my pool, rearranged my furniture, and otherwise caused massive mayhem with ddr while i impatiently waited for pizza to arrive.&nbsp; Actually it was a very very fun time, topped off with a screening of Donnie Darko&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undoubtedly one of my favorite MOVIES THAT MAKE YOU THINK.</P>
<P>yesterday, dropped off eekers sunglasses (which had somehow wedged themselves into one of the lounge chairs here *shrugs*) b/fore she left for the countryside, then spent the rest of the day with my cousin brian.&nbsp; watching sports.</P>
<P>and more sports.</P>
<P><FONT size=2>and more sports.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>and more sports.</FONT></P>
<P>And now I'm back here.&nbsp; Uhh...what else have i done...restrung my guitar with .11 gauge even though it's an acousting.&nbsp; because frankly, i couldn't stand the .12 and .13 gauge strings i was using.&nbsp; a: they were ""dead strings"" anyway, and b: my poor fingers can't hold down .12 &amp; .13 gauge strings for bar chords at the 1st &amp; 2nd frets</P>
<P>So yay!&nbsp; Oh, and thought there was a problem with my piezo pickup...not so--just too much pressure on the bridge with the old strings.&nbsp; With the lesser tension in these, it works like a charm.&nbsp; :-) yippee!!</P>
<P>was it last week that kehmna and I, carolyn (sp?), &amp; chasya went over to kristen's to see her b/f from school?&nbsp; maybe it was the week before...anyway, cool kid, from VA so extra points to him.&nbsp; hehe</P>
<P>A&nbsp;week from tomorrow, I leave for the Grove again.&nbsp; Feeling very mixed about it...i like it there and such, but i'll miss the folks back here.&nbsp; *shrugs* oh well, guess that's what they made AIM for *winks*</P>
<P>Ok, back to sermon writing--i'll be doin the sermon at my church this sunday and haven't finished *kicks self*...at least I have a good part of it done, unlike when I'm writing papers and such for school...hehe.</P>"

""You mind stopping in the pro shop?"" of course this could be a number of things.

Turns out--we need cash.  FAST.  And the cafe was out of bread becuase the shipment didn't arrive.  Sooooooo, I was given the task of driving over to SBM and Geissler's.  Slight problem: I walk to work.  (I mean come on, it's like maybe 500 yards from my house!)  So my boss gave me the keys to his car.  (Saturn SUV...LOVELY)
Needless to say, I saved the day, ended up buying like over 12 loaves of bread (Check out people were weirded out by this buyer for sure)
Did that, and guess what... for my ""trouble"" I was given a FREE LUNCH
(mm, can still taste that burger)

Well I thought it was cool.  I mean, it's food, so that's good.  It's free, so that's good.  Put 'em together, you've got it made.

Then I crashed since I was running on 5 hours of sleep or so.  Have updated my stock of WHR (ep 15--awesome).  Eh voila!

Church tomorrow, followed by working till dusk (or last player off the course).
Next week I've been granted special dispensation for chalice bearing at communion.  So freakin' excited...already practicing my lines...

""The blood of Christ, the cup of salvation.""
and just for a change of pace...
""This if the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for you.""

hehe, Christian headbanging all the way.

"event","After a much needed hiatus, I have returned to make you all suffer through my rehashing of an interpretation of 2001 A Space Odyssey.

As you recall Dave was shutting down HAL with a screwdriver...one of the more primitive tools that we humans have made.  One that won't talk back to you or try to kill you if it makes a mistake and gets paranoid.  So begins the process of surpassing the limitation of depending on advancements in tools to survive.

Without HAL running the ship, Dave makes his way to Jupiter's moons, gets in a shuttlepod thingy.  Again you here the breathing, showing how this human is like a fish in a little fish tank.  Contained, and vulnerable.  At long last, he comes across a huge black monolith in space, to which he makes the observation ""it's full of stars!"" (So begins 2010, 2001's sequel written and directed by neither kubrick nor clarke).  Then, we go on the acid trip sequence.

Colors, designs, eyeballs reflecting those colors, blinking.  THat's basically the next several minutes of this movie.  Let the viewer know that what I believe is being encountered is a space-time distortion known as a ""wormhole"" In which a section of space (of a plane that we have no knowledge or understanding of) opens a gateway to another unconnected section of space.

Think about travelling from point a to point b.  The shortest way to get from a to b is to go in a line, right?
A________________________________B

What a wormhole does is basically circumvent the line, such that 
A_B a is right next to b

Hence the pretty lights.  Oh, and the last shot of dave's eyeball, it blinks 13 times before cutting to the next angle/scene.  Intentional?  Probably.  What it means?  I don't know.  Perhaps kubrick reminds us subliminally of luck and probability.  Dave is after all presumed dead at the beginning of 2010 (but is he?).
Then again, this may be the introduction to the last portion of the movie--man's final ""impediment""-- mortality.

The pod lands in a white room.  Dave looks around in awe.  How did he get here?  And where is here?  Like I said, it could be the point b the wormhole sent him to happened to be this athmosphered enclosed room.  It may also be a pen.  An observation container if you will for some advanced life form watching dave.  who knows?

Anywho, through some nice cinematography, Dave sees himself growing older, graying, at one point eating supper.  DUring that meal his wine glass topples to the ground and breaks.  kubrick2001 notes here that though the wine glass is broken, the wine still exists as a puddle on the floor, noting a distinction between substance and container.  Similarly, we as humans are more than simply lumps of flesh that strut and fret their hour upon the stage and are heard no more.  Here Kubrick makes the point that what makes humanity what it is, is that every person has a soul.  While the body deteriorates, dies, and decays to dust, the soul continues to exist.
On his deathbed, Dave for the last time is greeted by a monolith.  He symbolically reaches out to it, just as the stargazing monkeys did, just as the guys on the moon did.

and then, STAR-EMBRYO IS BORN! sorta.  well, i guess it wouldn't be born, but you know, created.
again, what to make of this?  Possibly the next step in human (dare I say it?) ""evolution""?  That Dave, with the aid of the monolith's insight...or its representation of a challenge, rose to overcome mortality?

The end.  Sorry to bother anyone who's actually been reading this!  hehe"

"event","2001 A Space Odyssey.  Quite possibly the best yet most confusing science fiction flick I have ever seen.  And seeing that I have nothing better to do, let me share my thoughts on this.  (I wish to preface this by pointing all you folks who like me were like, ""wtf, mate?"" at the end...check out www.kubrick2001.com --a nice site with an animated interpretation of the movie).

For those too lazy to go there, stick around and here me rehash their points and add a little commentary of my own.

The movie begins with ""The Dawn of Man"" basically documenting the life of a bunch of primates.  actually they're australopithecus africanus, and while the creationist inside me screams in protest, I'll let let kubrick off easy on this one.  It's a tough life eating grass and dodging cheetahs.  Then one day the black monolith comes along.  already we ask ""wtf?"" and it's got the ghostly-wind-voice effect thing going on too.  So double wtf?
First a note on the sound, I believe the sound effect of multiple almost wailing voices give a sense of age and intelligence to this otherwise inanimate object--which segues into the second point: That this thing was made by someone or something.  Just after that, the proverbial light bulb goes on, said ape-man realizes he can use a femur to club wilderbeasts to death, solves dietary problems, and begins the process of fashioning tools for use in survival.

Step one of ""evolution"" accomplished.

Then comes 2001 A.D. (or is it C.E.?)  Guess what folks, on the surface of the moon we found ourselves another monolith.  Hmm, deliberately buried as well.  Same creepy voice thing.  And the landing craft looks like a human face, which i believe means to suggest how technology had developed to be the equal of man, and possibly superior to man in the environs of space where humans are dependent on their ships and suits and computers to live.  But more on that later.  We realize that this thing was fashioned by extra terrestrials and we somehow decided to go to Jupiter because obviously that's where aliens would hide.  (note the sarcasm).

We as viewers of the movie now realize the significance of the monolith.  Only now instead of apes hopping around in wonder, its astronauts taking pictures.  Perhaps less has changed over the millenia then we may first infer.  So anyway, the Discovery goes off to Jupiter for no apparent reason (scientific survey, first manned flight outside the asteroid belt maybe?)  You got Dave and Frank onboard as pilots or whatever.  You got 3 Doctors in suspended animation.  And you got the talking computer HAL 9000 that really does have a mind and intelligence of his own.  Not only does he run the stuff onboard to ship, but he converses with the other guys like another member of the crew.  Plays chess, adjusts the tanning salon, you name it.

Here the kubrick2001 site brings up a very interesting point: in HAL's pov, humans are really an unnecessary part of the mission.  They're doing nothing and are utterly dependant on him for survival.  HAL is quite proud to be the best computer ever, (the 9000 series never made a mistake or miscalculation ever.  And he's quite pleased to have such responsibility on the ship).  The crux of the matter here is that the tools have outgrowned their makers--and now rather than assisting the maker to live, they dictate it.  Ok, not too bad so far, and then...

""just a moment... just a moment...""  HAL predicts a failure of the communications array.  Dave replaces it but when they examine it, it seems to be in perfect working order.  BUM BUM BUUUUUM!!!!  Perfect computer has made a mistake.  What a disgrace!  They send telemetry back to whatever it is that's not NASA but fulfills the same purpose.  Ground control or whatever.  They cross referenced it with a HAL 9000 on earth, and the two computers didn't jive.  Ok, HAL's on the fritz.  Maybe he's down with a computer virus or something.  Or maybe he's too human==his AI was so ""advanced"" that like all of us sentient life forms it made a mistake.

Here HAL's actions can be read in two ways.  One: he truly believes that he is correct beyond the shadow of a doubt, and the reason for the discrepency is because of ""human error.""  Because of this, HAL believes the humans will jeopardize the mission.  Therefore, when he reads Frank and Dave's lips and learns of their intention to shut hiim down, he kills Frank, kills the guys in stasis, and attempts to kill Dave.

The other way to look at it is that HAL, ashamed that he broke the 9000's track record, decides to cover his tracks by eliminating the witnesses to the event--or that he's paranoid.  He did have a conversation with Dave about his concerns about the mission earlier--in fact just before he made the bogus prediction.  Could it be that his paranoia grew to the point where HAL eliminated his human companions out of primarily psychological provocation rather than extending his directive (to prevent the mission from being jeopardized) to its logical conclusion.

This does bring up an interesting point, where HAL underestimates human ingenuity, when Dave goes through the airlock without a helmet (which is theoretically possible-if you exhale before entering the vacuum of space) after HAL refused to open the pod bay doors.  Dave proceeds to shut down HAL with a screwdriver the ""simplest of tools"" so says kubrick2001.com  It is of interest to ponder what to consider life or a life form.  Would artificial intelligence like that of HAL 9000 constitute being a life form?  If so, would there be ethical concerns for shutting him down?

Get this, I love my job, but some days...  Ok, on saturday night I was working my usual afternoon-close shift.  A group starts playing 18 holes at like 4:15.  It takes like 3 hours to play 18 out there because it's a shorter course (par 60, normal course length is par 70).  When do I get out of work? 8:45pm.  Why?  That same group that started at 4:15 was still playing.  Hmm, what's wrong with this picture?  These 4 people took 4.5 hours to play a short course!!!!!!!

Oh well.  At least I get paid an hourly wage :-)

After that came my cousin scott's birthday party.  ""It's not every day yer boy turns 11 now is it?""  Hmm, i shouldn't have said that.  I should not have said that.

Ok, my hagrid impersonation is over, let us continue.  Since the kid basically wants to be like me, he's into the civil war and lord of the rings and all that.  (aww, to be a role model.)  (pauses to deflate head).  (and if a certain ryan kehmna is reading, don't read into that one).  So what to I get my little cousin for his birthday?  Nothing more or less than a poem written by yours truly in ELVISH.  Sindarin to be precise, although I'm nearly certain i made grammatical errors left and right.  Meh, I did what I could, since I haven't really learned the language.  Broke out a calligraphy pen too--i write better in tengwar than in english.

2) Definitely did better on Bib-Rev midterm than expected.  Go me.
3) Paper assignments for World History assigned.<---redundant I'm sure. Joy, rapture.
4) nearly fell asleep during choir, no reason for that.
5) home cooked me at a proff's house.  Nothing beats that.  Especially with the food service here.  Hehe.  You don't ask if it tastes good...you ask if it's edible!

Oh... 100th strong bad email: pure genious.
On that note, goodnight world...well half of it at least."

"event","So here I am, 12:15.  Finally got me an lj.  Fancy that.  I must admit, this day might never have come had it not been for the rather...shall we say emphatic suggestion that I do so by eekers1120.

Yup, and here I am.

Go me!



Today's been an interesting day.  Roomie got sick :-(  (hope I don't!), first day of educational philosophy presentations.  That was fun.  What was even more fun was planning tuesday's pres. with Jonny (WHOA, CHECK IT OUT!!!)  We'll be discussing a ""pirate's perspective"" of Social Reconstructionism.  Including of course ""the 3 arrrrrrs (R's).  Har har, let the pirate jokes begin!

Had a very strange hankering for himono, despite the fact that I've never had it before.  Oh well, chicken tenders night made up for that.

And woot for orchestra.  Holst's the Planets all the way.  Working on mars....gotta love 5/4 time!

Speaking of which, time to figure out Kagura's theme.

Spag out for now~~"

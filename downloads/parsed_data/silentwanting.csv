I guess no better place than the beginning. The last time I posted here was in 2006. My life has changed in many ways for the better and for the worse since that time.....but I have so much inside of me to get out.....at times I feel like I will explode with all of the thoughts and feelings that course thru me in a days time....hours times....minutes time. I suffer with a host of emotional/mental issues including ADHD....so at times...it is easy for me to get off track. I often wonder how I have managed to keep the same job for 6 years now....especially considering how bored I get and how fast it occurs. Already being distracted....will try this again later when my head is more quiet... if that is even remotely possible......</i></span></span></span>"

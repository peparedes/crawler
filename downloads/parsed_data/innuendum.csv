"event","So I sold out to another trend yesterday. I made a myspace account. I feel prostituted. And you know what's worse?? The damn thing won't work anymore. Something about my firewall being too strict. I guess that's my punishment.

School is so pointless. I go. I sit through three boring classes. I make my way through lunch. I sit through three more boring classes. And then I go home. 

Except, I have nothing to look forward to when I go home. There's nothing on TV. I don't talk to my parents. Nick's on the other side of the planet. And he hasn't called me in ages. My computer died. So I have to use my parents', which has crazy mad restrctions. At least they haven't had 3 viruses crash their computer in the past 3 months. Like me. And I have so much shit to review for AP's that I'm getting panicy. 

Oh yea. BTW. AP's are in two weeks. Well, technically they're next week, but the only one I have then is English. Which should be a breeze. This is kinda scary. Cuz I suck at Latin. And government kicks my ass as well.

*Sigh*

I'm sick of everything. 
Or maybe I'm just pms'ing.
At least I have prom at first week to look forward to."

<P>Ok, now for the housing options I put down on my housing survey. I really hope they put me in one of my top choices. The first is the Trustee House. All trustee scholars are allowed to live there, but there are a limited number of spots, so it's on a first-come, first-get basis. The second is the Engineering House. Both of the houses are really nice brownstones, in quiet neighborhoods and about 10 minutes away from the campus itself. The last one is smack in the middle of campus. It's 3 towers, all freshmen (1800 out of the 4000 freshmen live there). It's a total party dorm (which may or may not be a good thing).</P>

So I haven't updated in months. Actually, since the beginning of senior year. So there is much shit to be summarized. So here goes. And I mean summary. 

Year started well. Lots of college apps. 11 of them. Didn't do much of the school thing. Now i'm paying out the asshole ... i gotta bring up all my grades and somehow pass the APs. Four of them. Music is getting cancelled. Cross country went well. I lettered. But i got shin splints, so that hurt like a bitch. Season PR: 23:30 ... 1 minute, 45 seconds behind my sophomore PR. Fuck that. NHS ate up my whole life. As did Mock Trial. Mock trial went well. Fucked up 2 speeches wit ""dramatic"" pauses of 10 seconds. Ooops. My state performance was good tho. I got a most effective. Turns out, mock trial championship round and NHS state convention: same weekend. I was NHS state prez ... couldn't miss the convention. So guess what I did miss. That sucked ass. I cried. But i got over it. Life moves on.

I started dating Nick Goodman sometime in October. That just made my life. May not work out, with him being in Korea for 6 months and me in Boston for the next four years. But I so hope it does. Ha, who'dve thunk it? I've only had a crush on him for 4 years.

I got into college. I got into: Johns Hopkins BME, Boston University, Duke, Clemson, USC, Chapel Hill. Wait listed: MIT, Washington in St. Louis. Rejected: Harvard, Columbia. Guess i'm not good enough for them classy ivy folks. Fuck them. Boston gave me a full ride, acceptance to their engineering grad school, and maybe med school. Go Terriers!! Red is my new favorite color. Actually, red was always my favorite color. Guess now i have a new reason.

So yea, that's been my year. Over all: it has kicked ass beyond words.      

And here's a cool little quiz thingy i saw on other ppl's journals, so i figured, wtf?

Today was a really awesome day. Woke up really early this morning, and went to the district auditorium to play in the teachers beginning-of-the-year ceremony. The 1st was actually bearable. The jokes were funny, there was some fun/interesting stuff ... and it was early in the morning. And I met a bunch of cool new people. Ok, let's see if I remember them. There's: Brandon, Jessica, Rachel, Olivia, Dominic. Yup yup ... so I'll have the whole rest of the year to get to know them.

The 2nd half of the show was reeeeeeeeeeeally boring. Same show, same jokes, same movies, over and over, my god, it wouldn't end. But it did, and all was well. I just sat out and talked to Andrew (who by the way is an awesome little kid) and Sarah Bracey for a while, ran into Patrick, all was wonderful.

Then come afternoon ... PARTY TIME! Lots of people, lots of food, lots of Chinese. And I saw a million people that I've run into once or twice in the past 4 YEARS .. Manda Mackey (Knock know, who's there? Interrupting Aboriginee!!!), Patrick D, Carlie, Sarah, Liz, Joey, Charlie, Marina, Max, Mike .. THE WHOLE GANG, AND MORE!!! It was so awesome! All my best friends since elementary school ... so ... since ever ... and more ... back together! It was awesome. We took a trip down memory lane ... looked at a zillion old yearbooks, re-visited the WonderButts tradition, had a bunch of Chinese food, and had an unexpectedly great time. I've missed the old gang.

So yea, we had an awesome evening, with a Chinese theme, and only one down side. Sarah is leaving for China (hence the Chinese theme). The end of the night can very well be described as ""bitter-sweet"", since we laughed, we cried, we laughed, we cried some more. Literally. Heh. But I seriously don't see this as Sarah moving away forever ... just her going on vacation until Christmas. And then on another vacation from Christmas until the following summer. :)"

Woke up at 8:30. Decided to be lazy, went back to bed, woke up at 11:40. Took a shower. Ran out of shampoo. Had to use soap. Ugh. 

Went to orchestra practice at 12:20. Practice lasted til 5. Skipped cross country. Coach Shaw is going to kill me. Went to violin practice from 7-8:30. That was decent.

Worst news for the day: I'm taking AP Latin next year. There's 2 people in the class ... me and K.T. Coleburn. I hate that bitch. At least I'm gonna have fun making her life miserable. 

It's now 10. I need to write an essay. Orchestra tomorrow: 8:15 til 3. Ugh."

Last night was friggin awesome. I hung out w/ Sarah, Carlie, Liz, and Max for the first time in many months. Just like old times :)
The kids of the host family were very cool too. The oldest, Sam, i think, is a rising senior at Dreher ... very cute kid. But I totally pulled another Ioana moment when he said he went to Dreher. I misheard him. So I was like, ""You go to Juliard?!?!"" And then an awkward silence, and everybody started cracking up. LOL, oh well. The night went well, the food was good, and at the end of the day we jumped on their trampoline for like 15 minutes. It was great.

And here's a total shocker. Sarah is moving ... to China!!! As in ... red China. Far far away China. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WORLD China. I guess that's life for you, though. Gotta take whatever it throws at you next. 

Sarah, if you're reading this: I'M GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH!!
Now I'm just really sad that we didn't get together more over the last couple of months. I just never thought the China thing would actually come through. :( I hope you have lots of fun though! And who knows ... we may end up at the same college in a year :)"

Like, you don't understand, we were DEAD CENTER in row 4. We could see her, and she could see us. We could see her eyes ... bright blue. Except, we could see more than her eyes, we could see the pupils of her eyes. And her voice ... daaaaaaaayum. It was gorgeous. More gorgeous than on the CD. It was awesome. I can't get over it. My ears are still zinging actually. Last night my head was so loud, I couldn't go to sleep. But that's ok. I am SO HAPPY! It was worth every penny. Lindy and I were totally rocking throughout the concert, and we knew like every word, and we were singing along like dorks. Haha, I had a blast.

Ok, moving on ...

At work today, I talked to this guy that I met when I first started working there. Trey Barry (Taylor's brother). Very hot, very nice ... and we talked for like 30 minutes ... about techno! He likes techno! Can you believe that?? Anyways, he was super awesome, but he goes to Clemson, and today was my last day at work, so I'll probably never see him again. Oh well, he's a cool kid anyways.

You need an average of 4 on all of them, with 4 or higher on 8 tests. So yea, that's cool. But I don't qualify for Siemens. Amd that was like the one thing i really wanted, but you need all 5's for that, so nevermind.

Yup, so that's that. I don't wanna hear another fucking thing about AP's. Ever. Until 2 weeks from now when we start back up :("

"event","Finished my essay for The Stranger ... much easier than I thought. I just had to strain my brain a little to figure out what the hell the Sysiphus essay was about, but I figured it out. Wohooo!

Watched Cold Mountain today. I love that movie. I've watched it twice so far, and I've cried like 5 different times throughout the course of the movie each time. I'm a sucker for war movies w/ a romance storyline. 

My favorite movies of all time:

1. Cold Mountain
2. Four Feathers
3. The Patriot
4. The Last Samurai

Hmmm, I guess I just love movies that have action and romance. And I love bitter-sweet endings. I hate sad endings ... they make me cry and leave me feeling very empty. I hate happy endings even more ... they're very unrealistic. So I guess that leaves me w/ war movies and bittersweet endings ... somebody important always dies, but by the end of the movie they always figure out that there is life after love and love after death. Hmmmm. Interesting. I'm going to bed now."

I finished all the summer reading books. This rocks. I haven't written my essays yet, but I have a good idea about what I'm gonna write for each.

I wrote my Johns Hopkins college essay. And it totally kicks ass. It's really off the wall, and really creative, and at the end there's this awesome catch. I really hope it's good enough to get me in.

Yesterday I actually practiced some math problems for both SAT 1 and SAT 2.

I studied a bit of Latin this morning.

AND ... I drove on the highway and downtown for the 1st time ever ... which is embarrassing, yet awesome at the same time, cuz this means that I am this much *imagine about 1 cm distance b/w my fingers* closer to getting my licence.

Oh, and last nite totally rocked, cuz I ate dinner w/ Lindy, Joe, and Shivani, and then Lindy and I went to Shivvy's for a while. And Shivani's mom is now the coolest person in the whole world ... she can make KILLER mocha cappucino ice drinks, AND she said she can set me up to do research w/ a professor next year, on exactly the topic I wanna study.

Yey, life is good!"

"event","<P>So last night there was a cockroach in my room, and I seriously went bezookies (great word) when I saw it. I freaked out and got my dad to kill it for me. And then I read the Stranger a 2nd time.<BR>... the combination of these two is probably what triggered this dream:</P>
<P>I don't remember the exact course of events, but I do remember the climax. And it was very disturbing. It made me sick to my stomach. DON'T read this if you're overly sensitive or judgemental.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""The Dream""><BR>It really disturbed me. And it got me seriously thinking. 
<P>There were two rats. I was just going about my business (whatever it was, I don't remember), and I saw these two rats. And I flipped out. So I figured the only thing I could do was kill them. I chased after them for a while. And then I caught one. And I was fighting with it. I was fighting for my life. And it was biting me. And it hurt really bad ... I was bleeding. But I didn't care. All I wanted was to kill it. So I grabbed it by the stomach or neck or somethig, and tried to suffocate it. By this point, I didn't just want to kill it. I wanted to torture it first. I wanted to scare it, like it had scared me when I first saw it. I wanted it to fear its death before it was completely dead. ... But this whole time, I didn't think about what I was doing. I just did what came naturally .. what human nature told me to do. Then my dad came over, and I tried to get him to kill it for me. But my dad was like ""I'm not going to kill it, gosh .. it's a living thing. Let's just take it ourside or something and let it go.""<BR></lj-cut><BR><BR><P>That's when I woke up. I have never felt so bad in my life before. I felt guilty. I couldn't stop but think, ""what is fucking wrong with me? how could I do something like that, even if it's in a dream?"" </P>
Anyways, this got me thinking ....</P>
<P>What is life? <BR>What is the purpose of life? </P> What is it that drives people to do and think the things they do? <BR>I don't believe in God, or any sort of higher being. <BR>I don't believe in destiny. I don't believe there is any one set ""rules"" that we should follow. Now that doesn't mean I don't have morals. I do. But how do I know what morals to follow? How do&nbsp;I know what's right and what's wrong? </P>
<P>Anyways, so here's my take on life ...</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""LIFE ... OR SOMETHING LIKE IT&nbsp; :-)"">
<BR>I believe that we are solely responsible for our mindset and our actions. The only thing that influences us are every-day encounters. </P>I don't believe there is any meaning to the existance of human kind. I don't think that we are born having to fall into place and accomplish anything. If we so desire, we can do nothing with our entire life ... just exist. No emotional/social ties, no goals, no accomplishments ... just be here. 
</P>But I think that would be a very boring life to lead. So I think that we all spend our days trying to make our lives more interesting. How? By giving a false sense of ""meaning"" to life ... something that we adhere to day in and day out, just because we can. Some of us live for love. Some of us live for contributions to society. And some of us (or you, since I don't fall in this category), live for an imaginary friend, a guide, sort-of-speak .. God. If that's what makes you tick, fine by me. But I don't buy it. </P>I think that any and all misery, pain, violence, and war in this world comes from discrepancies in the meanings we give to our lives. It wasn't ""meant to be"", it wasn't determined by ""God"" a million years ago that this would happen ... it just is. 

I believe we follow the morals that we set for ourselves. So maybe you didn't set any morals for yourself, you just follow the status quo. Well, in that case, you are living your life by a ""meaning"" determined by some other John Doe ... whether it be Confucius, Marx, or some crazy prophet who conveniently made the whole world believe that he is the son of ""God"" ... an unidentified entity that all should bow down to and respect, cuz, well ... that was just the cool thing to do at the time. 

</P>Our minds, therefore, function in ways that we don't understand. Why don't we understand them? Because I think that human ""understanding"" stems from recognition of patterns, or symmetries of thought and action. And I honestly don't think our minds operate in any type of pattern. I believe that our minds are random ... our thoughts being as meaningless as our lives. <BR>So there is no pattern. My thoughts mean nothing to anybody but myself ... they either agree or disagree with the ""meaning"" that I have assigned to my life to make it more interesting than simple existentialism. My dream, therefore, meant nothing. It was just a series of neurological impulses, triggered by the suspense of seeing and killing that damn cockroach, and made clear by Camus's book, The Stranger.<BR></lj-cut><BR></P>
<P>The end ...&nbsp;I hope you found my ramblings interesting. If not ... it's not like it matters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>"

"event","I majorly overslept today. I was gonna wake up at 6:30 so I could take a shower and eat breakfast and all that jazz.

I woke up at 7:23. Nevermind the shower. Nevermind the breakfast. I just ran out the door as fast as my not-yet-functional body could take me.

Got to work, worked, got off work, got home, something happened for the next 5 hours that I don't really recall.

Then at 7 I had violin practice ... I almost cried. Ms. Harris gave me this horrible piece to sight-read. But the thing is that it wasn't even that hard, I was just so nervous that I couldn't even play the 1st position notes right. It was, as Lindy puts it .. ""a trainwreck in slow motion"".

And then I drove home with my dad ... badly. I rubbed a curb, and chickened out when he asked me to cross 2 lanes and just turned on another street.

I feel icky. I'm going to bed. G'night."

"event","Today was fun. Work went well. I've made $1,004.65 so far this summer. Too bad it's over in 3 weeks :(

And then Mr. Potosky came over and we did one of our driving sessions ... so I can hit the highway this weekend, and then take my test soon after that ... FINALLY! 

And then I was trying to find some excuse for skipping cross country practice, and right then Shivani called and was like ... Hey! Wanna do something w/ us? So I ended up going to Lindy's house, and we looked at her Scotland pictures for like an hour, and I played w/ Daisy some, and all was swell.

We then went to Hops. And ohhhhhhh myyyyyy, let me tell you about Hops. Shivani (being Shivani) squeezed her lemon so hard it flipped out, flew over our table, and landed somewhere on the floor next to us. It was the funniest thing ever. It's weird, the 4 out of like 5 times when me and Lindy and Shivani got together to eat dinner, we've gone to Hops. And the funniest shit always finds a way to happen there. Like Plucky, and racing to see which side of the fry the honey-mustard drips down first, and eating Calamari in ways you would've never believed possible. I love that place! ... But I'm getting really sick of it. We have to take a break from it for a while or else I'm gonna get so Hops-saturated that I'm never gonna be able to step in there again.

So that was that. Then I talked to Forrest (this awesome kid I met in Portland) for a while. And then I found out that the place where he's going to college (Rolla) and the place where I wanna go to college are 15 hours apart (driving). That's depressing.

Now I'm gonna go to bed and get my beauty sleep, and prepare for another FABULOUS day at work tomorrow. Ciao :)"

"event","Ok, I haven't updated in a while, so here's what's up.

Last Friday I saw SpiderMan with Lindsey and Jennifer. Then we went to Panino. No wait, the other way around. Anyways, it was super fun. Lindsey's leaving for Holland today ... no wait, she left yesterday ... and I'm gonna miss her.

Last Sunday: went to Folley Beach w/ my parents. Got fried ... I now look like hot dog that someone left on the grill for too long. And my face hurts.

Monday I ran almost 7 miles. And it felt f**ing awesome. I'm finally getting back into the swing of things w/ xc, cuz I kinda skipped last year. Jen is leaving for the next 3 weeks, which means I'd have to speed up and run with Sam (which won't happen, cuz that girl can do some serious running and I can't keep up). I might run w/ Leah ... if she shows up, that is. Or I might slow down. But that'd be stupid. Hmmm.

Tomorrow through Sunday I'm gonna be looking at some colleges w/ my parents. Here's the line-up: Duke, Chapel Hill, Richmond, UVA, George Washington, Gerogetown, Washington and Lee, Johns Hopkins. It's gonna be fun.

We got our computer fixed ... it's now running smoooooooooooooothly. Yey.

I am now addicted to LaunchCast ... unlimited Techno and House and Club music ... kill me now, I'm in heaven.

And Lindy and Shivvy are coming back to town this weekend ... YEY! :) WE NEED TO GO TO BANANA JOE'S GUYS! LIKE ... NOW!

Actually, what I really want is a european club, but I can't do that til winter. Bummer.

... so that's been my life of late ..."

"event","Ok, so I've been thinking lately. It's all about life, which reminds me of how much I hate my life, which leads to depression, and ... you see where this is going.

So I've decided to change my attitude towards life.

Yea, so I don't get along with my parents all the time, and I have like 5 friends. But when I think about it ... my parents fight with me because they love me and they want what's best for me ... and the 5 friends I do have, I'll have forever, cuz they're close friends that'll stick with me forever (I hope).

So here are my new goals, for the new me, starting now:

1. Stop getting depressed about life. See the good side of things and appreciate it, cuz life's short.

2. Appreciate the friends and family that I do have, cuz they're awesome people. ... Don't take them for granted.

3. Balance out my life. Don't overload academic courses, don't slack off from school either.

4. EXERCISE. BE ACTIVE. Work out every day, and once school starts: 4 hours/day. That won't be tough, since I'll have cross country, weightlifting, and dance every day. Ultimate goal: weigh 105 lb by the end of 12th grade. That means losing 20 lbs ... I can do it ... hmmm ... in theory.

5. Eat healthy. Healthy food = healthy body = good looking body = more self-confidence = better attitude = me happy. Well, at least it's good in theory.

6. Go see a shrink, at least for a little while, until I sort out the mess in my head. Cuz it's messy in there right now.

So that's that. I hope it works, cuz I'm sick of being depressed. The end :)"

"event","Today was the CRAZIEST, most stressful day at work ever!

I get in, and my boss tells me she and everyone else in our department has to take some stupid training class, so I have to just do a ""few"" little assignments on my own.

I then proceed to check my e-mail, with all my to-do lists, and BAM! 11 MESSAGES! Each one with ""do this"" and ""do that"" and ""change this"" and ""file that"" and all this other mess. This is more work then I would normally have to do in like 3 days, so I freak out momentarily, then chill and start working very efficiently.


And then Mr. Important-Big-Shot manager of something or other comes to me and is like ... ""Hey, your boss tells me you don't have much to do today, so I have about 25 drawings I want you to edit and print for me"".

... yea, sure, no problem! Except for the fact that MY COMPUTER IS SLOW AS ASS AND IT TAKES ME 4 MINUTES TO DO JUST ONE PRINT!!! Multiply that by 25, you mofo, and see what you get!

Of course, I didn't tell him that, I just worked away. And come 11, (I leave at 12) .. I finally get back to my own work. Well, what do you know ... EVERYTHING decides to break down on me. The copier, the printer, the letter-head paper is gone, Word is f*ing up, and I'm stuck b/w 15 technological mishaps and am about to hit something.

Finally, I realize it's 12:20, and my dad has been waiting outside for 20 minutes, and which point I run out. And what do you know ... THE FRONT DOOR IS LOCKED! So here comes Ioana, running at FULL SPEED, .. BAM! .. into the front door, almost falls back on her ass, with 10 black technician guys waiting. So I press the magic green button, the door opens, and I AM FREE AT LAST!

... all this by 12:22 pm. *SIIIIIIIIIIIIGH*"

The last two really don't matter, cuz I'm never gonna be able to use them. But whatever, the rest is good. Plus my salary up to date, I'm at about $1200.</P>
<P>Ultimate goal: make enough money to afford a week-long trip to Ibiza summer after my senior year. Europe, island&nbsp;for rich people in the Meditarranean, lots of techno clubbing. Damn, I'm gonna have to work my ass off to afford that. But who knows.</P>
<P>And now, my schedule for next year .... </P>
<P>Good side: absolutely everything I wanted fit perfctly. And I have like 4 electives. HOORAY! </P>
<P>Bad side: EVERYTHING I wanted fit. Which means EB - 7th yearlong. Hell no, I'm not doing all this. There will probably be some droppage of classes on the way. But as of now, here it is:</P>

"event","So yesterday was a cool day. I got home from work around 12:30, watched like 3 movies in the afternoon, and then went out with my parents.

We went to Applebees and the waiter there was slow as shit. I've met him before, he's one of Michael Ardeline's friends. Michael was waitering there too, so I turned to him and was like .. hey, can you tell your friend over there to come back here and visit once every thirty minutes or so? And his response was, ""Oh, if you need anything, just stop me .. that guy has no idea what he's doing."" I was amuzed.

And then I dropped my dad off at home and drove to Goody's w/ my mom, where I saw the cutest stuff ... and bought nothing, cuz we were late and my mom had to run out like she was being chased by a fucking dinosaur.

And then we met up w/ my dad again at Polo at 9:45 and watched The Terminal. THAT IS THE CUTEST MOVIE EVER! AND I LOVE TOM HANKS! He is my ultimate hero, I love that guy. Especially when he's playing an Eastern European guy w/ a Romanian accent. And I also found out that croissants were invented in Romania. Hmm, you learn new stuff ever day. 

I ran into Amanda Mackey and Ethan there (I was so embarrassed, I'd forgotten ethan's name!). But anyways, it's so weird. The 2 times I saw Amanda in the past 3 years was at movie theatres. So yea, that brightened my day.

I'm gonna go shopping again, and this time hopefully I'll have more fruitful results. Adios."

Chemistry: 730
Bilogy: 710
Physics: 650

At first, that sounds dencent. Not the best, but OK. And then I looked at the percentiles: 85, 78, and 47. Motherfucker! How can a 650 end up in the 47th percentile? That makes me mad. I really wanted to do well, since this was a one-time thing. No way I'm retaking these damn tests again, they were way too stressful to study for and take all over again. 

I just hope this isn't an indication of how I did on the AP's, cuz that shit really matters.

... In other news ... 

I talked to Nick Goodman yesterday, which was cool cuz it's been 3 years since I last had a conversation with him. That kid is a cool cucumber. Joe got a telemarketing job ... CONGRATS! YOU ROCK JOE! Job's going well. And I'm about to veg out in front of the TV for the rest of the day. Adios."

"event","I haven't really been myself over the past few weeks. I feel really depressed all the time, and even if I occationally go through bursts of enthusiasm or happiness, I always end up right where I started ... lonely, confused, depressed, etc, all that good stuff. 

So a few nights ago (I think last wednesday), this feeling hit again. I was so sad, and lonely, I started crying. It wasn't any one specific event that triggered it, I guess just thinking about life in general got the best of me. I cried myself to sleep.

Now for the weird part ...

That night, I dreamt about a kid I used to know. I met him freshman year, and he was the coolest guy ever. He was always cheerful, genuinely nice, and I always found myself happy (or at least amused) after every conversation with him. He just had this endless energy in him that always spread to other people. He helped me through that transition from middle to high school, and I'm really greatful for the person he was (in a very platonic, non-romantic, non-teenage-crush sort of way). I've talked to him maybe twice in the past 3 years. He graduated that year. 

In my dream, he came up to me and gave me a big hug. That's it. 3 seconds max. Or that's all I remember of it, cuz it's all that mattered. 

The next morning I woke up feeling better than I have in weeks. It was a beautiful morning, the sun was up, the birds were chirping, and all I could think about was how lucky I am to be who I am, to be in good health, to have the friends that I have, to have a family, a job, etc. And I started thinking about all the good things that have happened to me lately, and all my accomplishments, and for once I felt really really good (not just about meaningless material things, but about life).

So, to that kid, whose name's importance pales in comparison to his personality ... thanks. 

Well, he's never gonna see this site, but the moral of the story is: be nice to people, you never know how it'll affect them in the future.

:) Ciao"

We went to Hops before that, Dunkin Donuts right after, and chilled at Shivani's for a while, where we were entertained by Dr. Jani and MBC. By the way, I have just been introduced to MBC. Not sure what it stands for, but it's an ""addictive"" (according to Lindy) Arabic channel that's really funny to watch.

The hyperness of getting Evanescence tickets wore off, and now I'm not jumping off the walls anymore, just glad that I got them. I think it's gonna be an awesome experience.

We're actually in row 4, but the lady said that she doesn't think anybody sits in rows 1-3 cuz it's too close to the stage. And if they do, they probably can't see shit. HAHAHA! </P>
<P>So yea, the tickets went on sale today at 10:00 am. My dad called a bit earlier, and the ticketmaster dude was like, ""Sorry, the tickets go on sale in two minutes."" And my dad was like ""Oh, ok, so let's chat for 2 minutes."" And he said that they talked about some random shit for two minutes, and he got the 1st tickets at 10! :-)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Oh, and now for the TOTALLY weird part. My parents like normal rock. I like the more gothic-sounding rock (that and creepy gothic german techno). So I was totally expecting my parents do say HELL NO! when I mentioned the concert to them. And not only did they say yes, they were like .. Oh sure! We'll take 1/2 day off to drive you up there. Once again ... HOLY SHIT! Could this day get any better?</P>

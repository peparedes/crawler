"event","So basically the only reason I keep my lifeguarding job is because of teaching swim lessons!  I love em!  I just finished my second session today! Kinda sad!  I had a buncha  of really cute kids in this class.  In my first class, Jackie gave me and Beckie (the girl I teach with) princess crowns....soooo cute!   She wouldn't even go near the water last session, but now shes putting her face underwater and everything! And shes so adorable.

In our second class, it wsa kinda crazy! We had a lil boy named Cole, and he was so sooooo cool! He would tell us to Peace Out A-town!  COmplete with the hand signals and everything!  He gave us picture frames with his picture in them!  And he would always wear his cool sunglasses to class!  He even cried at the end of swim lessons.  Emily gave us Mary Kay Satin Hands lotion!  So awesome, because that cholrine is a killer!

Aww I'm a little sad that this session is over, but I still have one more to go starting on Mon!


In the words of Cool Cole Peace Out A-Town"

Shorewood used to be so safe, now it isn't so.
It's not that someone stole it, they were just so special.  I remember when I got them for graduation.  Anne was late to my party and I was sooooo mad, bc at the beginning of my party no one was there....just some old people and family friends that no one really likes....so when Anne finally got there I couldve rang her neck but I went out to her car, and there was my very own set of bags!  No more borrowing people sets for rib fest. AHHH it was the best graduation gift EVER!  Even at Ole Miss, I loved telling people about my bags, bc no one plays that there...

....I was talking ot the police officer and started crying.  I don't know why maybe because I was a little drunk, but still it was called for...I'm PISSES"

You are the true rock star.

independent, powerful and seriously charismatic, you're not too eager to please.
And if you make money being yourself, who is anyone to quibble?

A few weeks ago my daddy gave me a case of Mike's hard lemonade....assorted flavors....CUTE but so Sophomore year of high school...but how could I break my daddy's heart.
So I thought it would be a great idea to drink them all that night, so they wouldn't go stale.
So I drank a lot....by myself....in the dorm room.....

Then Liz called and wanted to go to Taco Bell.....so Regan drove my car with Me Liz and Kameron in it to YUMMY Taco Bell.....so then on our way back we saw that the sprinklers were on in the Grove....so we decided it would be a GREAT idea to park the car, jump out and run through the sprinklers.....so we did....and it was prolly the most fun I have EVER had in Oxford....

"event","This quote I have ALWAYS loved, but it has never meant so much to me as it does now.

Maybe our mistakes are what make our fate.  Without them, what would shape our lives?  Perhaps if we never veered off course, we wouldn't fall in love, have babies, or be who we are.  After all, seasons change.  So do cities.  People come into your life and people go.  But it's comforting to know that the ones you love are ALWAYS in your heart.  And if you're very lucky, only a plane ride away.


I love those friends who call you just because they have a feeling that you are upset. i feel like i don't have a friend like that here."

"event","So a while ago Liz and I decided to go home for the weekend. So we boarded a plane in Memphis courtesy of Northwest Airlines, and thought we were going home.  but BUT o we were wrong.  Even before we got on the plane there was trouble.  o the bathrooms were broken on the plane so we had to run to the potty. And even before that there was the incident when I left scissors in my backpack (oops) and it was major chaos, because apperently I look like a terrorist!  Which makes me fell special!

So back to the story, Liz and I are on the plan and we are chilling and reading our magazines when we feel the plane turn (this would never happend in a flight from memphis to chicago---it just goes straight).  So we are liek Hmmmmm this is strange!  and then the pilot gets on the mic and informs us that due to mechanical difficulties we have to turn around and go back to Memphis (NOT COOL), and we were already half way into the flight.

So it was like OOOO you can go home....OOO WAIT NEVERMIND NO! YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO STINKY OLE MEMPHIS!  GOD! 

So we turn around and go back to Memphis.  So then when we land safely in memphis the stewartess asks if anyone has to go to the bathroom....and EVERYONE does!  HAHA.  So we had to get a police escort to go the bathroom, which was really cool. Like we were celebrities! 

So we get on the plane and we tried to get ahold of our parents and let them know that we would be late, but apperently they didn't love us enough to answer our call on their cell phones!  but FINALLY we got ahold of them before we got on the plane!  Thank God

So an hour and a half later after we were supposed to land we finally arrive safely in midway!!  and we were SO SO SO HAPPY!

The End!"

"event","So this is going to sound really weird.  I haven't been homesick really since I have been back, besides for the random moments that aren't reeally even worth mentioning.  But this weekend I went to Jackson, MS with Shannon and Bryce and stayed with Shannon and her family.  And it was just awesome.  Her family is a lot like my family, so it made me feel at home.  Over the weekend my friends called me and when i hung up with them I wasn't crying or anything, I was just content with having conversation with them.  i used to get so upset after I talked to them because i would miss them so much.  but now it's ok, but now as I sit here I am so homesick and I have no clue why!  It's crazy.  I was talking to Chelsea and she thinks it's because I just left someone ELSE's home and it made me wish mine (and I think because it's so close).

This is all true. Ole Miss would prolly be the perfect place for me if it was 2 hours away. But it's not 2 hours away, it's 10.  And I never get to come home, which is so hard.  AHH enough rambling. 

GOOD NEWS....that's all I want people to hear.  Mom and Dad are coming this weekend!! YAY (even though I wish I could come home instead), and 2 weeks after that I AM GOING HOME. It will be so much fun."

Sorry but I didn't confirm to be your friend because I don't really know you anymore and I haven't for a very long time. If you would like to change this, write me emails, but we were young kids when we were friends and I truly believe that we both have changed tremediously in the lond period of time that we were seperated. I hope you can understand.

Does she not know that this is the FACEBOOK?  i mean I accept people I have never even met.  It's not like she's signing her life away.  So me and the other St. Jude kids on the facebook have all tried to add her as our friends and she has rejected us all.  How rude is that?  I'm a good friend.  and I'm a really fun girl.

The best part of this whole situation is that I can now reveal her secret...in the 2nd grade Danielle urinated in her skort (yes we wore skorts) and I didn't tell anyone.  Even when the whole room smelled like PEE i didn't tell...that's a true friend.

Alright that's enough....if she doesn't want to be facebook friends with the St. Jude kids then she is MISSING out!"

"event","Tomorrow I go back to hell. I'm sorry if that offends people, but to me it is a living hell.

So on Thursday I went up to Michigan State University to visit my bestest friend Anne, who goes to school there!  It was amazing!  I can see why Anne wasn't homesick at all!  I had an absolute blast there.  I could totally see myself going there and loving it.  

But that's the thing, could I ever go there?  I do not like Ole Miss- that is a fact.  No offense to anyone, it's just not the right place for me! And I want to transfer.  And that's where it ends.  I can't leave people.  I feel bad for leaving Ole Miss, like I am letting people down.  I hate making people unhappy.  And then there's another thing.  My neighbor Adam wants to go to Ole Miss, which is awesome, I'm really glad he wants to go there (he's only a Junior now), and his older brother is even goign to Mississippi State.  But I don't want him to feel like I do, I don't want him to make the same mistake like I did.  Grace warned me, she told me not to go there, don't go so far away from home, you won't like it.  And it's true.  It sucks.  It sucks that I am totally disconnected from home at all times.  even though I feel like I stay in touch witht he lives of my friends, I'm totally out of the loop, and that hurts.  It's not like i feel left out or anything.  It's just I'm not available to them, ever.  I can't come home if something is going on!  It sucks.  When I was at Michigan State, everyone was telling me how I have to come when they are having this party where a bunch of our friends from high school will be there.  And it killed me to have to say that I couldn't make it.  I hate that feeling of letting people down.  It literally sucks!

Well I'm going to get on finishing packing.  i have a lot of goodbyes to say tomorrow.  I hate goodbyes.  I hate crying, I hate seeing people cry.  I just hate the whole thought of tomorrow.  I wish I was a strong person like Anne.  I sobbed today saying goodbye to her dog Abby.

I think the only good thing that has come out of this is my awesome new car.  I love it!"

"event","So yesterday was my birhtday and we had a big party and i was drunk and i puked and it was a good time.  I even cried bc i had to say goodbye to 2 of my best friends.  AShley left already this morning at like 6 am, so i had a drunken goodbye to her.  And then i said goodbye to anne too, even though im going to her house before she leaves.  i hate when my friends leave.  I HATE GOODBYES.  everyone says get used to it. but why do i have too?  I really don't want to-so i don't think i ever really have to get used to goodbyes!!  One month and 10 days. One month and 10 Days.  I'll keep that in my mind!!!"

"event","So I have been running into/talking to many people from my swimming childhood lately.  This is so much fun. and it's also a little sad because I miss that part of my life.  When I retired from swimming, it was one of the hardest things I ever did.  I lost touch with so many people that were liek family to me and it's so funny to think of memories from these meets.

Some funny randon swimming memories:
HAHA  when we were like 8 Taylor, Mandi and I were running aroudn the Decauter swim meet, waiting for their sister to get done swimming so we could go to the awesome public pool and play swim all day. So we were at the vendors stand and we saw ALL this stuff that we wanted.  I wanted this hat. Tay wanted a T-shirt and Mandi wanted i think sandals i think.  But being 8 we didn't have money, so we decided to try and find ""jobs"" at this swim meet.  So we went and asked our coach (Bob Peto---what a winner) for a job (this was probably Taylor's idea).  He and the other assistant coaches tell us that if we cheer for all the JETS in the next events that they will give us all the change they have.  Of course we are thinking that we will be rich, and be able to pay for all the things we want in the swim store.  So we cheer for these people and get some change from the coaches. Somehow our moms find out what we have been doing and they get mad at us of course and make us give the money back.  We were really sad, but yet we got what we wanted anyways.  It was probably the only way to shut us up ever.  I mean can you imagine Taylor and I at 8 years old?  We were probably even more annoying than we are now! So here I am almost 19 years old And Taylor still gets me in trouble!

If anyone (meaning Kerry Sindewald) has any other good old swim team stories, please let me know"

"event","So i have come to the conclusion that none of my friends can keep secrets.  SO one person finds out about the group X-mas gift and now ALL the girls know.  The boys prolly would know if they weren't so dumb.  True Story.

So Shorewood has been good so far this break.  Molly found ornaments in the Christian Store that say, ""When God made Shorewood, He was just showing off"".....o dear...WOW we were so excited to get those.  Bon-a-rama, was even more excited than me I think.

Bon-a-rama bought Den Den a cell phone for Christmas.  This prolly isn't a good idea because 1. Dad HATES technology, anything to do with it.  Computers, cell phones, phones in general!  Hates it all. and 2. He's going to lose it.  I mean seriously has she met my dad ever?  He loses EVERYTHING!.  I couldn't find my car keys when i got home for Christmas.  I'm predicting a fun X-mas wiht that present!

I haven't finished my Christmas shopping either.  Still need to buy for Bon-a-rama, Den Den, Anne and Molly. OO and Cole.  He's been a good dog, so I think he deserves a treat as well.  Maybe I'll buy something for Cuddles and the cat too.  But i like Cole, he's been very good and has even sat nicely on the couch with me.  I miss that dog a lot at school.  He's very charming!  Even though everyone else except Bryan hates him, I think I'll keep him!!

i got a digital camera and printer for Christmas from Roro.  I picked it out---- 1. Because Bon-a-rama is not capable of picking out anything technical.  She has good taste with clothes, and jewelry that's about it.  Technology isn't her thing.  2.  Because Roro loves me and she also can't go shopping anymore.  She's old and blind.  It's a shame, she's a cool cat.  Everyone should meet Roro.  She's a trip.  ALL my friends have a RORO story.

Well thats all for now.  Not much going on!  Have a good X-mas everyone.  
Sarah"

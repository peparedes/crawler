We've been stealing from our nextdoor neighbor who is polite enough NOT to have a password to his suprisingly fast internet...However, we have to fashion a laptop area on the backporch right next to the windowsill in order to get it. It's still nice of him to obviously not care about who steals his internet connection.

I have a brand new iMac that I've been using for a month as a fancy DVD player (with a remote!). Once I get the internet it'll fulfill its function properly (with a remote!!!)

I think I got super lucky picking a college I finally like. I like most of the teacher. The students. The atmosphere. But I'm too painfully awkward and shy to actually talk to anyone in my classes. No snazzy lunch breaks with classmates. Only me and my loud iPod and a lonely lunch somewhere on campus.

I should really see if Lizz wants some company before her 6pm class.

Yes, it's true. I am starving. And if there was another person in this room, odds are I'd punch them for money for McDonalds.

I've been successfully unemployed for nearly 2 months. It's nice, but straining. So instead of going out and looking for worthwhile work, I'm going back to my old pizza place to work as a meager phone worker for my Saturday and Sunday nights. At least I have precedence, and I'll get to attend the ""late Christmas party"".

Everything besides money and feeling fulfilled in my stomach has been looking up. I totally aced my Accounting quiz, and I'm a week and a half ahead. I saw my Fall semester Drawing teacher and she is always a delight to talk to. Not only does she love me, but she's so creative and helpful that I'm sure she would recommend me to other teachers. It's been looking up. I'm a A student (as opposed to my previous failure, hence leaving me a year behind everyone) and I'm going to summer school to catch up so I can hopefully graduate in Spring of 2008, like what was in ""the master plan"".

My brother, Daniel, is coming up visit me tomorrow. I am so nervous. I cleaned the whole house, swept, mopped, cleaned and reorganized my room, cleaned the air vents (who knew dust so easily collected there??), and fed the kitties (although Spike Lee chooses to nap on my bed instead of eating).

I should tell Lizz I smoked 3 of her cigarettes. I'll wait until she gets home from her study group. And I'm hoping my Netflix of Scrubs Season 2: Disc 2 has arrived. That show is so horribly addicting that I look forward to running downstairs in the freezing cold just to see if it came. But it's far too cold, and I'm too much of a puss. I'll just wait for Lizz to bring it on up.

Actually, I probably will go downstairs and check because as much as I love my Tick :Season One DVD, I've watched every episode to the point of vomiting that I could quote it. And how lame do I have to be to start quoting The Tick?

I could really go for a mean burrito right about now. Only $3.94, if anyone wants to donate to the cause."

On an Economics quiz. 
I AM SHOCKED.</b> 

Maybe this whole school thing will work out after all. It seems like the weeks have been getting shorter. Balancing work and school (only Saturday off...) has been challenging, but I'm working through it. If I were a hippie, I'd say I was definetly becoming far more zen and various other shit.

And then I pissed off a friend with some asshole comment I thought was funny. It wasn't. And even though I apologized, I think he's still mad at me. But technically, he has no right to be considering he has done some bad things to me, too. It's a constant back and forth with him because as much as I want to hate him, I don't. In the end, I guess it'll work out and we'll stop fooling ourselves into thinking we are friends. Or have much in common. As much as I would like it to work out, I doubt it can because I like him more than he likes me; and it's blatantly obvious. But he panders to me because...well...sex is a tempting thing.

This is all merely speculation; but I believe it will probably come to pass.

But thus far, let's see where this friendship goes. Because it can only go one way. We are either friends or we're not.

Lighter note: I got a lot of compliments on my genie shoes today.

But the neighbor thing I could be onto something, but it's too early and awkward to tell. Because, well, I'm naturally awkward.

"event","So I'm taking this sweet Animal Bahvior class. We watch videos about animals, we discuss animals, AND we get to go to the Lincoln Park Zoo. But today, I was horrified when my teacher let me in on a little known thing and I feel it necessary to tell all of you, raw food eaters alike, and maybe you can test the validity of the statement.

<b> Apparently eating raw oysters and clams can give you Hepatitus!</b>
Now the reason is that oysters and clams have purified eating, as in they purify what comes in and out, and so when they are in the water, sometimes the viruses don't leave their systems after it's purified for them to eat and gets stuck there. So he told me that oysters can carry Hepatitus! Here's how our conversation went:

Teacher: ""You shouldn't eat raw oysters""
Me: *Laugh* ""Why?""
Teacher: ""I'll tell you why. You could get Hepatitus""
Me: *Shocked but still laughing* ""What? I've been eating raw oysters for YEARS! I'm from the Gulf Coast, it's what we do.""
Teacher: ""Well, you look healthy enough not to worry. I'd suggest not eating them though, or at least known exactly what water they come from.""

So if anybody else wants to research this, please do. Why must they kill every little joy I have in life?!?! Next thing you know catfish will be uneatable because of some treacherous, body-eating disease and then where will I be? Still not eating meat, that's where."

I also guess the way obscene septum ring kinds of adds a bit of edge. I mean, I wouldn't fuck with me on a dark, deserted street corner at night.

This week should be the final leap into going back to school. Let's hope all goes well as planned and I can be attending school full time again rather than simply pissing my life away answering phones at a pizza joint. But it pays bills and allows me to enjoy the things I love.

For all who know me rather well, especially Tubbs and Matt Davis, they know my thoughts and feelings on camping. After Outward Bound, simply absolutly not. Well, I broke down. I was told that camping can be really fun with friends, drinking and swimming in the woods. I guess I'll have to let go of that old, and terribly traumatic memory of Outward Bound and the hellish conditions they forced upon us (Matt Davis knows this all too well.) So this weekend I think Zack and I are going camping. It's not official, but I'm terribly nervous. Maybe we'll just go to his place and watch movies about the woods. But I kind of would like to get drunk and crazy by a campfire. But I can only think of Cabin Fever and think, what if? All I know is, I'll be bringing my game face and some Sparks.

It's often occured to me that people are jerks. Customers are jerks. Co-workers are jerks. Bosses are jerks. Friends who break promises are jerks. And maybe I'm a jerk. Many people have this preconceieved notion that I, Carly Rachal, am a big, drunk, offensive, and impulsive prick. I'd like to clear the record by saying, I really don't think that's the case. I could throw around the phrase ""misunderstood"" or ""confused adolescent"", but that wouldn't quite embody all that is there. I think at one point, I was a huge jerk face. I was mean, bitter, drunk, and held many grudges. I think over the past couple of months, I've calmed down and let go of a lot of the bitter grudges I once held as lasting forever. Rachel and I are talking again; and it doesn't involve yelling or discussion of the past. The past is done with, I did what I did and possibly in vein. I should have never been such a jerk and offensive to so many people. I haven't quite given up all vices (including being a jerk when it is due or saying outlandish and embarrassing things) but I have been able to kind of just let go, sit down, drink a beer, and relax and enjoy whatever is going on.

The new apartment: I kind of have this preconceieved notion from nowhere, of course, that when we move into this new place little birds come up to the window sill the second we start moving in and tweet us a tune, and a squirrel comes by to hang out, and maybe we find a puppy named Pups. Moving into this new place and switching schools will hopefully mean our lives turn around. Lizz and I deserve it. It truly has been a bad year for the two of us.

Growing up: Growing up is not pleasant. It feels kind of like when you get growth spurts and your bones hurt. I'm 20; my bones should not hurt. I should not have fainting spells. I should not throw up because of stress and anxiety. I should not have crippling anxiety/panic attacks. Does growing up do this to everyone too? Or is it just me? 

Friends: Kyle is no longer apart of our friend crew. He has fucked us over and left us out to dry like the fucking pansy he is. Rachel and I are speaking again. Very bizarre, and causing me to have somemore unnecessary anxiety attacks.

Boys: New interest to speak of. But I'd rather not jinx it. Or get the hopes too high as they usually are.

Lizz: She seems to think I write about nothing but her, so I'll humor her. Yes, Lizz, I only write about you. Nothing else is important at all.

I am super excited and I hope there might be good shows, and some good drinks, and some good friends, and some good drama (finally).

And maybe I'll rekindle something with people I've lost touch with. I have this amazing ability to rapidly lose touch with people or drive them to hating me (although this would be a good x-men worthy power; I can't seem to figure out how to control it). I just don't want any fights to go down; but then again, troule seems to follow me. Or maybe I bring the trouble? But I haven't actually been in a good fight in awhile (I think my last good verbal fight was with our neighbor on the back porch; she called me a pussy for not stepping up and beating the crap out of her; I am proud I didn't).

"event","I've been kind of crazy lately. Just working and sleeping and going to maybe one party on the weekend. That party happened to be at my house. Pictures were taken, soon to be posted. I'm sure they are funny. I even saw a cell phone video of me all drunk and laughing and then trying to hide from the camera. But I didn't. I just kept laughing.

I don't know. I think I'm going to try and be less impulsive. My middle name given at birth should have been Impulsive. Carly Impulsive Rachal. But I've thought about the way people see me and how much I don't care, but being impulsive makes me slightly unhappier. I mean, sure I like just doing things for the sake of doing them, but for some things maybe I should really just think about the repercusions and what makes me happy.

Hmm. What a thought to ponder.

I've totally underestimated the power of a peanut butter and jelly snack. Yum."

"event","Looking at all these apartments online makes me kind of sad because this apartment is beautiful. But is laced with a lot of bad memories, and costs too much. Plus, when one neighbor hates you, it's all downhill from that.
I know me and Lizz's new place won't quite be wonderful, or even in a good neighborhood (Helloooo Pilsen) but that's the sacrifice you make being able to live and afford housing. And to put that with school as well, it's quite ridiculous. But I'll be living with Lizz and that's all that really matters.
I miss Coty, but he's doing better than before. And that makes me happy, even though he's not here anymore.
And Tubbs found a gutter punk sleeping in her house. How ridiculously funny. And very Tubbs-esque.

And well, my thoughts have been that sometimes I get this urge to be back in New Orleans. It's weird, because when I'm there I don't do much other than drink and stay out late, and rarely see Tubbs because she is a busy, busy lady. But sometimes I just get this feeling like I should be there, going to UNO, working, and living in an apartment. It sounds weird, but I even visualize it and how it would be. But I don't even know if it would make me happy, and I fear that if I would even move back there this year or next year that much wouldn't change. I worry that I wouldn't meet many new people because, well, I never meet many new people there (although Tubbs has that whole thing down). And being within a grabbing range of my parents would drive me nuts, no matter how cool they are. And it's virtually impossible to find someone to date who hasn't dated/fucked one of your friends. And I do plan on moving back, but I think it couldn't be for another 3 years. Who knows? Maybe I'll completely rethink that. And the cool thing is, Lizz wants to move down there and we'd open a small business for her clothes. Wow, sounds kind of adult of me to be thinking like that.

So I'm working on my essay for Columbia (I'm totally late and procrastinating on that shit). And I guess it's okay. Or maybe it sucks. I hate it when I have to write an essay answering a stupid question.

And right now I am watching Uptown Girls in my apartment...alone. And I still think that Dakota Fanning is one of the creepiest kids ever. And Cheaters is one of the best shows ever.

Here's to you, Joey Greco. You sly, fathful devil you."

"event","So Lizz may make fun of every television show I watch, but I think they are genius. So here is a list of shows I watch and why I am majorly obsessed with them. (Also, a key included in which ones Lizz hates/likes on a 1-10 scale)

<b>1. Degrassi: The Next Generation
Lizz Level: 6</b>

I start off with one of my old favorites. Degrassi: The Next Generation has been a big part of my life for the past 3 years. Yes, I've been watching it for nearly 3 years. I even watched the ""Every Degrassi:The Next Generation Episode Ever Made"" Marathon....for 3 days. This show intrigues me for a number of reasons. Number one being that it's Canadian. Number two in that they are melo-dramatic to the point of laughter, but realistic because even characters get Gonnereha (sp?) and get killed off. How many shows kill off one of their main characters and STILL go on strong? Degrassi, that's who. Not only that, characters from the old 80s Degrassi (which pales in comparison) are parents and teachers in the The Next Generation. Just saying The Next Generation gives it a Star Trek kinf of feel.

Lizz may say I am ""clinically insane"" for loving this show to the point that I do, but I've seen her get into it. Even though she refuses to learn the names, she gives them nicknames like ""Dumb Face"" and ""Eyebrows"", I've seen her walk out the room and come back to ask me ""Who's pregnant now?!""

<b>2. My Super Sweet 16
Lizz Level: 4</b>

I don't know if anyone who reads this actually attended my Sweet 16 (and yes, it was against my will), but this makes me jump up and down. I LOVE this show. I don't think I can even pick a favorite one, they are all THAT outrageous. I watched a recent one where Marissa ( a name I never liked anyway) got her SECOND brand new car. And her dad's response to the crowd when they were all ""WHAT THE FUCK? A SECOND CAR, WHOAAA"", was this.
""My daughter only turns 16 once!!"" Followed by happy clapping.
Oh My God. AWESOME. This show embodies everyone of my gulty pleasures...
1.Stupid, teen white girls
2. Extravaent, and ridiculous spending
3. Stupid, mind numbingly oblivious parents

YES!

Lizz enjoys this show to a point, then gets frustrated and walks out the room saying ""God Carly, can't we watch something else? That girl is so stupid. I hate generic rich white bitches"". But Coty and I are huge fans, and the 3rd season I hope will be awesome, too.

<b>3. The OC
Lizz Level: 1</b>

Okay, so I haven't watched the show from the first season, but the past 2 seasons, I can't get enough. I really, really can't watch enough OC. Someone even gave me an OC Mix CD Season 2, and I was thrilled. I usually watch it every week without skipping a beat, but my room mates usually win over and force me to change it...but I keep up. I mean, it's about rich kids, one coming from Chino and getting adopted into the Cohen family and some messed up socialites. I love fucked up socialites and kids from Chino with ""bad reps"", who now make good. And Seth Cohen is my boyfriend.

Lizz roryally hates this show. She bad mouthes it every second I mention it. One more time, and I'll give her a bad mouth.

...More to come soon. I'm still coming up with Lizz repsonses to some shows. Next I think I'll mention some Original Disney Movies and Disney Shows (Phil Of The Future, anyone?)"

"event","The days are winding down to summer. The weather in Chicago is beautiful and all I can do is dread the oncoming days. Coty's leaving, I haven't applied to any schools, and I have to move.

I am too scared to go back to school next semester. I have an anxiety attack evertyime I think of returning to school and making my parents proud. I don't think I could hack it even if I tried. I think maybe another semester and working on projects to make my portfolio wonderful. And lots of working at the pizza place and making money so my parents don't think I'm a fucking scabby knee that won't go away. 

I am really sad Coty has to go back to Portland. The guy has made Chicago wonderful and helped me deal wih my own insanity while coping with his. He was an awesome room mate and I want to visit him in Portland and hopefully drugs won't be involved. 

I don't think I like any drugs anymore. Mostly, they just make me nervous and feel awkward. Even though I feel awkward most of the time anyway.

God, I miss Tubbs. We dont talk that much, but I tell so many awesome stories about her. Like that one time she lived with me for a week and we slept on my tiny cot and discussed how the letter V is hardly used. But then we went into a big schpeal discussing words staring with V; I was shocked at how many there were. Vendetta, victim, etc. Oh man, we should totally telephone tag some V words.

The other night Lizz and I ran a block to catch the bus and I got winded. Maybe I smoke too much.

I can't wait to move. I think we'll move from Little Puerto Rico Logan Square to Little Mexico Pilsen because it's cheaper, and we want a dog. My dog.

I think we;re going to BBQ today, which is rad. And most righteous.

""The boogeyman checks his closet for Chuck Norris"". And Lily said the funniest, sleaziest thing the other day. When mentioned that her and Coty are like siblings, she says....""Hmm, I guess that's why the sex is so awkward."" and Coty replied: ""Yeah, the 30 seconds of it"". Oh, funny sex jokes are funny."

And that's it for my update with pictures. We also have a kitty, but she wasn't very photogenic. She will be though, when she finally wakes up from the nap she's been taking naps for days.

"event","So after spending only 3 days in New Orleans and seeing not enough people and actually partying very little (sans Saturday night), I FUCKING LOVE MY NEW FRENCH QUARTER HOUSE.

So here's some stories from The Mardi Gras: Saturday 25th

Woke up late, missed plane, begged and found my way home after 7 hours. Go to Big Daddy's and get some drinks, drinks, drinks. Then go to the Pub, dance with some gay men, drink with some gay men, have gay men tell me that I have pretty hair. Then we went to Molly's and nothing was going on there, and then we just started going into any bar and buying drinks. I think that night I went into 6 bars and bought drinks. Then it happened...I got really drunk. REAL DRUNK. We met up with some high school friends at Tropical Isle and I managed to scream to everyone that I was the Queen of Mardi Gras, and walked around from place to place just yelling and smiling and kissing on Hayman and telling him how much I love him. And I saw Mirell's boyfiend Greg, and we exchanged Hellos and How Are Yous and then he ran off, I guess confusedly. Which was appropriate. I haven't been the BFF of him or his girlfriend. ODD. Then at about 4am when everyone left, I met some guy and his homeboy on the street and we went to The Dungeon....a leather bar. So I went in all my adorableness and everyone looked at me oddly, but fuck them. The dude kept buying me beer. And then we went upstairs and I SWEAR I saw a guy getting head in a cage. And then I stumbled home and woke up the next day to extreme sickness which meant no partying for like 2 days. Luckily, Grampa Noah felt the same way so we hung out. 

And I got to see my faorite people and some not so favorite people, but it was a good trip. And Tubbs, we will meet up again my love.

And then I took a plane back to Chicago expecting it to be lovely since everyone moved their stuff around...

...and the first thing my neighbor (now at this time my new roomate) says to me as I walk through the door :"" Carly, I can't live here."" 

So I proceed to ask why, and tell her that it's fine and is she moves out she was really fucking us over. And thinking Lizz and I had convinced her, we went to sleep at like midnight.

...And when Lizz and I awoke, we looked in her room and everything was gone, LITERALLY EVERYTHING. Apparently, the bitch moved back next door while we were asleep and didn't say anything.

I AM FUCKING PISSED. IT IS ONE THING TO CONFRONT US ABOUT SOME PROBLEMS, IT IS ANOTHER TO MOVE IN ( AND FIGHT OVER A FUCKING BEDROOM NO LOESS) FOR 3 DAYS AND THEN PROCEED TO MOVE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT LIKE A MOTHER FUCKING COWARD. GO TO HELL. I HOPE YOU FUCKING DIE. ANYONE WHO SYMPATHIZES WITH SCUM LIKE THIS CAN GO SUCK A DICK AND DROWN. 

So we've taken to locking our door and if she dares ask for anything, even if her stupid ex boyfriend comes back with a god damned bitcher knife for her, I will not let her use my phone ever again. In fact, I hope he comes back with a butcher knife and slices something of hers off.

The worst part about this whole situation was that Lizz was relieved because then she might be able to work only 5 days a week instead of the 7 she already works (she works about 65 hours a week) because the rent would be cheaper with 4 people, but now she actually has to work more. THANK YOU ERIN, I HOPE YOUR HAPPY KILLING PEOPLE, YOU FUCKING CUNT WHORE.

Whew, I'll probably punch a hole in a wall later or something."

So as of this week, I have been avoiding work because of a most heinous freon leak. I almost fainted, and got sick from it for two days, so my boss let me off until it's fixed. But boredom is taking over and I find myself just cleaning the house. I don't usually clean, but it's fucking nice.

Man, I can't fucking wait to see Tubbs, Matt and Greg. Commence the dry humping, for there will be tons of it.

TONS OF HUMPING.

I have the gayest and most perverse Livejournal. Should I be proud of such an achievement? I find myself reading Beaver's and thinking ""Man, I miss that kid and his crazy shenannigans""

I think I'm going to buy a Polaroid today because I haven't taken any pictures in forever.

"event","As much as I love doing things on my own and not hearing the nagging from my mother, growing up <b>royally</b> fucking blows.

Problem #1: Rachel is moving out. And sort of leaving us high and dry. So some how, a 19 year old has her shit together more than her 22 year old room mate. Fucking lovely. I hope she has fun fucking us over, and she better God Damn well hope someone moves in by March 1st, or else I am killing someone. And I am not even kidding about the murdering of another being.

Problem #2: Rachel and I are also ""not so much"" friends. Apparently, she thinks I am unstable and she magically just started hating Coty (this is, of course, after she accused him of stealing a blanket, which HE DOES NOT DO) and therefore feels awkward in our own home. She hates my life and thinks I am a drunk, also not true. Hateful, and spiteful I am.

Tubbs is right, only read this shit for daily dose of bitter.

In good news,

I got real drunk on Saturday night and woke up very far away, naked, in some girl's apartment. I am sure my naked awakening really freaked her out, I mean, I doub she knew who I was as well. And I got my septum pierced, and it feels real fucking good.

Side Note #1: Holy crap, Trading Races looks ridiculous. Must watch to ridicule and eventually learn about my racism within me. TUBBS WATCH OUT!!!"

"event","So after not eating in forever, or eating anything of substance besides sour gummi worms and Twix, my friend Ian was nice enough to buy me a Domino's cheesybread and extra cheese pizza.

What a fucking mistake.

Not-So-Awesome Story #1: After two slices and half the thing of cheesy bread, something went terribly wrong in my stomach. There was churning, but not the good creamy ""I am SOOO full churning"" that one would expect after a real meal. No, this churning meant the end of me.

So then it was off to bed with a slight stomach ache, and after 3 hours of sleeping something woke me up, and it was the need to vomit. So I thrashed across my room, and landed in the bathroom and threw up for 5 minutes. Whew, I was happy it was over.

Oh no, it wasn't over. So then after another hour of attempting sleep, I drank 18 million more glasses of water and realized the feeling was back. So I thrashed again and I Swear To God a pizza waterfall blew out of my mouth for about 20 minutes. Fucking Lactose intolerance.

So then I woke up at my usual time of 9:15am, and realized I was too sick to go to work so I called my boss and left three messages claiming I probably had food poisoning and I was throwing up all morning. No answer. I am not even sure anyone opened up the store. No one called me back to verify me taking the day off. So who knows, I may be fired.

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME STORY #2: So recently, my household has been filled with very crude conversation and one especially made me think about how gross my friends and I are. We had an hour long discussion of people we know or ourselves shitting themselves at an age fully capable to not do so. And I was shocked by how many people these days crap their pants. Or pee themselves. One kid added that hockey players pee themselves all the time because you can't leave during the game for a bathroom break thanks to all the padding. And this one particular kid responded ""Yeah, I've peed myself a couple of times."" There was clapping and glorious hoopla. Everyone shared their little story of either shitting or peeing themselves and it was great. Tubbs would be proud. She loves pooping. 

And then I was informed someone almost crapped my bed last night. AWESOME.

And let's hope I cam go home for Mardi Gras. If so, it'll probably just be for the weekend. Oh yeah."

"event","Now, I haven't been much of a Livejournaler. I usually use it to drunk post or bitch things out and then have it thrown back in my face. It's a series of gossip, and I, of course, wanted nothing more to do with it. I don't think anyone even reads this. Are you reading this? If so, comment. I would like to have a solid Livejournal; one full of stories, revelations, awesome thoughts, and rad pictures. But thus far, I have been really sub par. And I am not happy with this. This is the time for change, and new beginnings. I have an almost full time job, I have a solid lifestyle, and I have my very close friends at hand (sans Tubbs and Matt who should constantly be at my side all day, every day.) If I were rich, I'd pay for them to follow me around with a boombox, and tell me how awesome or lame I am. 

So recently I was thinking I should pimp this thing out. And tell great stories. And think awesome thoughts.

Awesome Thought #1: So my new given name (given to me by the oh so lovely Coty and Lizz) is Claire Pamprin, and we all have a sitcom. There is no such title as of now, but soon, one will come and it will be grand. Coty will be playing Nick Cavell, and Lizz is Rebecca Bowan, and we all have our stereotypes. I am the badass, who cuts class (whether we are in college or high school, I am not sure) and smokes and drinks and hits things. Lizz is the nerd with books, and constantly she has to push up her glasses. Coty will for some reason have a gun, and he's going to slide around on the hood alot and look sleazy. He's the Class Sleaze. And it works for him. For some reason, I find myself writing out scripts in my head even though I know it will never come to pass. It's just a cute idea, and it's adorable. 

Sadly, right now, I am out of awesome stories except I got too drunk last night and went to bed at 10:15pm, but that is less awesome. Actually, it's pretty stupid.

And now I'm watching That 70's Show and wishing I were on it because I would totally mack on Hyde, and then he'd push me around and I'd cry and be cut out of the show.

So prepare for new things, if anybody actually reads this.

And sidenote: Tubbs, IT IS SO NOT FUNNY THAT THEY WANT ME TO SING AT WORK. JERK."

Here's a little ditty that I have to sing if they tip. Do the theme of The Flintstones

""Cold Stone, you're at Cold Stone
We're a scooper dooper family

No joke. This is not a lie. I have to learn these songs, and then sing them if someone tips. Luckily, I will be working alone for most of the time and maybe I can get out of it. Or sing so terribly, they'll tip me NOt to sing.

"event","So I am now a resident of Chicago, not a college student anymore. I must join a workforce. I could try and go back to my old job, but I'll be answering phones in the basement for the same pay with more work. I guess that'll do.

One thing I don't like is all this resume business. Writing a resume is bullshit, and is therefore full of bullshit. Sure, I ""technically"" left my job at Lakeview Fine Foods because of ""Conflictions with school"". That roughly translates into ""I had something to do, they fired me."". My resume makes it look like I stay at a job for 4 months max and then bolt. If only they knew the back stories! I swear, I'm a good worker. I even worked for that prostitute for 2 months, and that job was shit. And degrading. 

So this week begins my quest for a decent job. It's unfortunate I can't be a waitress, and most retail places want prior retail experience. Bastards. Well, I could be a coffee bitch again. I know a lot about coffee, and still remember how to make all those damn drinks. Oh please, grant me a job as soon as possible for I owe the bank a sizeable amount of money. 

To Do List:
-- Go to school, fill out paperwork for semester off
-- (Hopefully) pick up refund check, beg parents for start up money
-- Run around the city looking for jobs
-- Get a month long pass
-- Stop pulling out my hair (this is a life To Do)
-- If given sizeable amount of money from parents, pay off credit card...then cut it up and burn it and curse the company for ever thinking I was reliable enough to pay a monthly sum.

Who knew I would be so broke that I can't really leave the house? Eh, it's not so bad. Peanut Butter does make a good breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Instead of eating real food, sans Coty's delicious homemade mashed potatoes, Lizz made peanut butter smoothies with some ice cream and M and M's and peanut butter.

Goodbye memory of New Years' Eve.

I ended up with a busted face, some cuts, a chipped tooth, and some bloody knees.

Man, oh man. Delightful to have no one know what I did, but if I did get into a fight (highly possible), then I must have lost...
...and that would suck."

It's not that, I just don't want to be here any longer. My family cancelled Christmas, and I don't have access to a car, and if I did, I wouldn't drive. That pesky warrant might be enough to scare me out of driving a car with no right rearview mirror.

As much as I adore this city with my heart, I miss Chicago. I miss Rachel and Rod and seeing them couple up and get all cute. I miss Lizz's lame ass, and us always talking shit. I miss her telling me to bring her a nose, and her and Coty ganging up on me. I miss listening to Queen and Doctor Worm everyday, and dancing in the apartment. I hardly dance in the apartment here. Not much dancing room, and no one to dance with (except maybe my dad?). I miss Coty telling me to stop censoring him, and having him steal my favorite jacket even when he knows I want to wear it.


I've had outrageous fun with Tubbs since I've been here. I hope she knows that. I know she probably hates me for never just relazing and siting back and smoking a fat bowl, but I feel if I did, I'd get all weird and freak her out. But just running around with her Knight In Shining Hat is fun and I'll never turn that down.

I wish I saw Matt more. I think we haven't been close since I've been here. I get the strange sensation that he's mad at me for various reasons, some from Chicago and my choices there. And as much as I love him, I won't budge on some things.

I'm not letting my mom and dad keep me here longer. I will be damned if they do. And make them miserable. I can do that, you know.

I'm excited to see the boys at the Way Out show on the 3rd. Two weeks and no Plum?? Ouch.

I have a list of <b>Love Letters</b> I need to put up:

Dear Eli Roth, Writer/Director of <i>Cabin Fever</i>,

<b> I love you.</b> Cabin fever was amazing, to say the least. Your campy style, declaration of ""Squirrels are gay"", and uncomfortable south paw scene that resulted in a not happy Sean Hunter. You are a dear. I have to say, I also appreciated your use of the diss <b> ""OHHHHHH FACE!!!!!""</b> to be a welcome surprise. I think FACE is coming back in a big way. I've heard it multiple times since watching Cabin Fever a week ago, and I am thoroughly pleased.

So thank you, for making me fall in love with horror movies again.

Your Loving Fan,

Carly ""OHHH FACE!!!"" Rachel

"event","This morning in my Gay and Lesbian Lit class, the idea of ""trashy"" came up. Now, we had just finished reading a pulp novel on the scary world of lesbians!! AHH run in fear of the girl who thinks she's a boy type shit. Well then everyone in class was talking about the book not being ""high literature"".

This is where I had a problem.

Now I know it's hard to find some trashy novel about lesbians and their ways ""high art"", but they disregarded my point about ""trash art"" or trash anything being worthwhile. So I had to defend myself, and since I lack some class and a sense of how to articulate, it ended up more like this..

""errr..I love trash. Soap operas and infomercials, fuck yeah""

So I wanted to articulate it in a way I find most suitable for how I actually feel about trash art, instead of my garbled morning talk.

I find something fantastically ingriguing in an infomercial. Think about it, someone in the production team thought what they were making was <b><i> good</b></i>. Doesn't that seem completely interesting? Everyone I know seems to think it's crap and soap operas are crap and reality TV is crap and so on. But I find it all very beautiful in a sick way that regardless of marketing and money making, someone thought it was good. Then again, I hang out with art kids. They like to think they know it all and that high art and literature is the only way to go. Who are they to tell me that my love of Goosebumps is crap?!?!

However, a lot of people think I'm stupid. Sure, it may be justified on some end. I don't articulate well when pressure is put on, and saying ""Fuck yeah, I love infomercials"" doesn't give me much ""art school cred"".

I know I'm not fucking stupid. The difference between my love of trashy things and the common persons is that they are unaware of the line drawn between good and bad. I love trashy because I wholeheartedly believe a lot of it was made with the intention to be good, and I admire that. I think the only person who knows he makes trash art that I find appealing would be Jeff Koons. I can't get enough of that cocky fucker. But then again, his cockiness about his art is also appealing. I mean, he was dating an Italian porn star/Parliament member. He <b><i>really can do what he wants</b></i>. He makes really funny, very trashy art. And goddamnit, more power to him.

A lot of people either love or hate Andy Warhol. I, personally, love Warhol and think his concepts of marketing and mass media were so interesting. For my Art and Celeb class I had to read some entries from his diary. The man writes like a 12-year-old girl, and that is sweet. He liked what he made, and made no excuses. Why should he have to excuse his work because some high art fuckhead thought he was playing too much to the common persons appeal? His art was approachable, and I find no problem with this. Hence why I have a problem with Gertrude Stein. She is so far removed and high up on her pedestal of ""I have friends in high places. I used to chill with Picasso"" that her work has no heart, in my opinion. Sure, she was intelligent. But it doesn't mean that everything she wrote was wonderful. She called herself a genius all the time, and treated her girlfriend like a commoner. I just don't get her genuine attitude to try and impress or try and put feeling into her work. Plus, it sounds more like high end Dr. Suess, but without all the fun involved.

And to the Pulp Novels. Dear God if I could get my hand on some right now. Hell, give me some romance novels with Fabio on the cover. I don't eat it up because I'm stupid and can't read anything pass a 2nd grade level. I love it because I know someone reads it, and thinks it's good writing. I also know that they think the cover art is great, too. I feel that way about John Grisham. ""Oh, yeah. Another book about some conspiracy. JOY!!!"". 

I'm trying to figure out where this all stemmed from. A lot of my family is trashy, without knowing so. I guess maybe that has something to do with it. My brother loves John Grisham novels, and anyday of the week, I will support his love. Why not revel in stupidity some times? What if the world was full of geniuses? We'd have the same, if not more, similar problems we do in a country full of stupids. Okay, retract that, I don't believe everyone is stupid. I just think a lot of people don't put thought and effort into what they think, or why they think it. So the word ""stupid"" comes to mind.

Case in point. I think Tubbs is a genius. Tubbs also LOVES Law and Order: SVU. That is quite possibly the coolest shit ever. And the thing is, she knows it's kind of a cheesy show. Okay, it's really cheesy. The acting is decent, but the plots, sometimes get a little thin. But she <b>knows</b> this, and I think that is what makes it genuine. Hell, I used to watch Dragonball Z and love it. I've got no qualms owning up to my nerdiness.

I think it's interesting because so many people hide their secret loves of mainstream things. I have a mainstream favorite band and they go by the name of ""My Chemical Romance"" and fuck anyone who tells me I'm lame because of it. I'll play ""Helena"" as loud as I want, whenever I want. And I sing along to it, too. I think this whole ""I'm pretentious, I listen to this, read this, watch this and I am a higher being for it"" is completely null invoid because I know when you were a kid, you wore ribbons in your hair, had lame braces, or even liked Korn. It's nothing to be ashamed about it, own up to it, and just accept that it's oay to like ""trash"".

So to everyone in my Gay and Lesbian Lit class this morning, I am articulate and I have my reasons for falling in love with soap operas, infomercials, reality TV, and the like. And I like My Chemical Romance. 

P.S. I am in the student lounge, and these three ladies are watching ""As The World Turns"", I think. More power to them."

But as you can see, I am still a little upset. No matter how much he tries to lick my face, I will never enjoy it!

And then I met up with those losers. Chris and Beth. Precious. 

So that party got lame, and I decided to walk around drunkenly by myself, where I met up with a Mexican wrestler and we chatted and he walked me to another party. What a gentleman! And then I met up with my friend Andrew.

Contrary to popular belief, Andrew always dresses like a lumberjack. So it is not suprising that he would not change for Halloween. Way to go!

Fucking Bob Ross!!! He paints happy trees! Yeah, so Bob Ross and I chilled. And he gave me Bacardi. I knew he was drunk most of the time on his show. Fucking Bob Ross.

And then he tried to lick me. Bob Ross tried to lick me!

And then I tried to lick my friend Luke. He just looked so good as a nun, I couldn't help myself. he could also bust a mean move on the dance floor.

I wouldn't even know how to explain that picture. He was a clown? He was scary.

So then that party started to trickle off at about 4am, so I wondered off by myself yet again. And I found a train stop, so I got on it. But I was alone! So I met these guys.

They thought my anime knowledge was adorably dorky, so they missed their stop just to walk me home. I love nice people. Especially ones that think a girl who used to watch Dragonball Z is cool. Fucking right I was cool.

And then I came home and jerked off a bottle of Captain Morgan. The End.

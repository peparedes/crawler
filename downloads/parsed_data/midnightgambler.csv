"event","<br />Went up the California coast to the Paso Robles/San Luis Obispo/Cambria area with partners in crime <lj user=""blithescribe"">&nbsp; and <lj user=""mortgaged""></lj>&nbsp; for a weekend of wine tasting, beer tasting and food sampling.&nbsp; Of course I came back with more than I expected:&nbsp; spicy olives, &quot;atomic&quot; mushrooms, &quot;frog balls&quot; (spicy, pickled brussel sprouts), habanero-stuffed olives, various spreads, chutney, etc.&nbsp; And lots of Port.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Tempranillo, Petit Syrah, Zinfandels (it <em>was</em> Zin-fest afterall) and, of course, beer.&nbsp; (Willing to share with those who drop by (while supplies last)).&nbsp; (Wish I had more money to spend!)<br /><br />The weather was a little cooler and we had a rain/hail storm come in overnight Saturday, with lots of wind Sunday morning to whip those trees around and churn up some whitecaps out on the ocean.&nbsp; Lots of fog in the evening (not much fun to drive through) and a longish drive there and back again, but well worth it.&nbsp; Good food, fun new wineries, great&nbsp;beer, wine, food&nbsp;and good company.&nbsp; What more could you ask for?&nbsp; (Ok, maybe a few more days...and more friends to share with.)<br /><br />Highly recommended wineries:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mitchella</em>: great people, nice atmosphere, great cheese and chocolate pairings and the vintner is a real Port enthusiast.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Lone Madrone</em>:&nbsp; good Zinfandels, good food (Beef Bourguignon -yum!), and an interesting floor show (funny and somewhat brazen chickens).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Laetitia (Barnwood)</em>&nbsp;and <em>Clairborne &amp; Churchill&nbsp; </em>(on the way up and back respectively) were both phenomenal.<br /><br />I did get to visit both Firestone Walker brewhouses (the one near Buellton serves lunch and dinner and is a little quieter than the SLO location (former home of SLO Brewery)).<br /><br />The only regret I had is that I couldn't be two places at once and had to miss the AHA Rally at Stone Brewery in Escondido (but I don't want to become Dr. Manhattan&nbsp;-then I wouldn't enjoy anything on this planet!).&nbsp; (I <em>am</em>&nbsp;expecting a full report from the C.o.W. members who did visit though...)<br /><br />-Cheers!<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; Also recommend <em>Midnight&nbsp;Cellars </em>and <em>Dark Star.<br /></em>"

"event","I quit my job today.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just walked out.<br /><br />Most of you know that I typically don't do things this way, but sometimes you just can't help it.<br /><br />I gave my notice last week and my manager went into panic mode because he was going to be short staffed.&nbsp; I called my new job to find out when the starting date was going to be and found out it would be a week later than anticipated.&nbsp; I called my manager and&nbsp;said I could help him out and stay another week (I could just as well have taken a short vacation).&nbsp; I even came&nbsp;in early (7am) on Weds morning after working until 9:30 pm the night before to help clean and remodel the electronics and appliance departments (along with other salespeople and managers from other stores).<br /><br />Today, the district manager f-wad saw me standing idle for about 10 minutes today and informed me that I should be doing ""something"", i.e. either training or cleaning.&nbsp; Then my manager comes up to me&nbsp; and says ""Tell me you're not the reason I'm being chewed out.""&nbsp; He then proceeds to tell me that I should either help with the remodeling/cleaning, clean something or do some training when he knows damn well I won't be there much longer and the only reason I'm really staying is to help him out.&nbsp; Any manager that doesn't have the balls to stand up for one of his people doesn't deserve my respect or loyalty.&nbsp; Granted, part of my job is to help keep the place clean and help out the rest of the team (and I do more than my share), but I work on commission and I'm here to sell.&nbsp; That's how I pay my bills.&nbsp; More than that, it was the <em>way</em> the message&nbsp;was delivered that really got to me.&nbsp; I'm not some 17 year old working his first job at McDonalds or Starbucks, I'm an experienced sales professional.<br /><br />I went to lunch at a local Outback Steakhouse, ordered myself a beer and meditated for a while.&nbsp; Why was I torturing myself?&nbsp; How many more times do I have to bite my tongue?&nbsp; Why do I keep working for a bunch of incompetent, bureaucratic f-wads?&nbsp; Answer: I don't know.&nbsp; Time to stop torturing myself and move on.<br /><br />If anybody needs any help with anything this week, I'm available.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Back to brewing..."

"event","<p>Z Beer Update will now be called Z Brew Update since the BBZ B&amp;B&nbsp; (a.k.a. Canyon City Brewery) is expanding to brew mead, cider and other tasty beverages.<br /><br />I've watched one of my colleagues post a ""lyrics quiz"", seen the sorry state of my disorganized cd collection and have decided to do one of my own, but with a twist.&nbsp; To the winner will be awarded a bottle of Mead (a semi-sweet, wine-like beverage made from California Orange Blossum Honey with c. 14.5% alcohol by volume).&nbsp; Since I only brewed a small batch of about a case in size and 6 bottles have already been allocated, this may be your only chance to make sure you score one for yourself!&nbsp; (I'll make a larger batch next time.)&nbsp; So here it goes:<br /><br />All lyrics are from Rock &amp; Roll bands (of various genres, from 1950's to 2000's).&nbsp; The first one to correctly identify the song and the band gets the credit for it (just post a comment with your answer).&nbsp; The one with the most points wins (one point per song).&nbsp; In case of a tie there will be a one song tie-breaker with a 24 hour time limit (there can be only one...).&nbsp; This contest will run until Friday May 2, 2008 at 12:00 noon or until all of the songs/bands are guessed correctly (whichever come first).&nbsp; Scores will be updated daily.&nbsp; (This is one f'd up, schizoid mix taken completely at random from my overblown cd collection.)<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp;""So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains and we never even know we have the key.""<strong>blithescribe: The Eagles ""Already Gone""</strong><br />2.&nbsp;

"event","Had an emergency brewing session today. The beer supply is running low! 

Mortgaged and I put our heads together and came up with a couple of recipes for an Irish Red Ale and an IPA. They have been brewed and should start fermenting shortly. These should be ready within about two weeks. 

The Maibock is coming along nicely. It has a while longer to go before it goes into lagering but it tastes great already. Tomorrow I plan to bottle the mead (time permitting). 

(Don't worry celticcowboy68, the Rauchbier (and the Dunkel) will be brewed after the Maibock goes into cold storage (lagering)). 


Filled with mingled cream and amber 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will drain that glass again. 
Such hilarious visions clamber 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the chamber of my brain- 
Quaintest thoughts - queerest fancies 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to life and fade away: 
What care I how time advances? 
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am drinking ale today.

That's right boys and girls.  Rumors of its demise were premature.
Apparently the mead ""micro-gnomes"" did all my work for me while I was sleeping.  I never saw much activity, but when I took a hydrometer reading this afternoon it was 0.99 (less dense than water).  All that worrying for nothing...

I have formulated a recipe for a barleywine which should be ready for brewing in May for consumption in December. 

If anyone has any requests or would like to partake, please feel free to drop me a line. (Also highly recommended and on tap at the BBZ B&amp;B is a smoked porter that mortgaged has brewed. Quite tasty and recommended for those who like stout and porter.)

Tomorrow I plan to brew a Maibock.  Unfortunately this will not be ready until the 1st or 2nd week of June (Junebock?).  This delay is due to a reluctant batch of mead, to which I have since pitched new yeast, added more yeast nutrient and raised the fermentation temperature.  This mead is now on ""suicide watch"".  (Mead fans may pray for its successful recovery if they feel so inclined.)

Also on the brew schedule are a smoky Rauchbier for celticcowboy68 and a Bavarian Dunkel.  These will be brewed immediately after the Maibock is ready to move on to lagering.  Also in the works are plans for another Ocktoberfest beer which I plan to have ready for the first weekend in October (Prost!) and a barleywine for Christmas.

If anyone has any special requests, please let me know.  In the meantime, stay tuned for the next edition of ""Z Beer Update""."

Eventhough this is a propaganda film, it is still worth seeing.  Although I did not think that getting involved in Iraq was a good thing, the ""War on Terror"" is one we cannot afford to lose.  

Coming soon to a country near you?

This is not an endorsement of any particular candidate, just a point of interest.  You must make up your own minds... don't give anyone a free pass."

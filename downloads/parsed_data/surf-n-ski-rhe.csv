"event","^ that is my prayer. I really have to stay focused on God this year and really get a rock solid faith. It's my last year in my place, my school, my house, etc. Soon I will have to move on,and this is the reason it is so important for me to stay grounded. I have been thinking and discussing my opinion of how awesome it would be to have a Godly guy. Wow! This past weekend was BLAST and some of our roomates talked about their boyfriends. You can tell the difference in a Godly guy and a worldy guy. I haven't really given this much thought untill now. How awesome would it be to have a boyfriend that prayed with you?! Dont' think that I am sitting here being desperate for a guy, I'm not at all. I am actually perfectly content the way I am. But Just the thought....i get excited! 
It is so hard to be a light in a surronding dark world. Esp. At the lunch table when you are with your so called friends....you still love to talk about the stuff they do and act like they do....but you Can't. how do you do that?! Any comments or advice are welcome.
I pray that God takes away my judgemental comments..and thoughts...."

"event","Last night was a blast at the Winfrey! It was me and Alli and Bet! Lindsey decided she and Katie would just meet us there to say hey! Somehow we ended up getting our own room while Aunt Dianne and a women's group stayed with Donna in a two bedroom Suite. Meanwhile, Alli and I rack up over $100 dollars in Room service~ wow who would of thought~ I am going to miss the Gaines so much... more memories were made and feelings will never be forgotten! I got my letter from Alabama...I got in! My fish died-the second girl to die- Chanel :( how sad. oh well...VEgas lives on!

"event","Hey everyone! i never post bc no one ever replys... Last night was so much fun! Tay and I went and hung out in Hoover with ""hawk"" and Josh Jones and David Holcomb. it was alot of fun...crazy actually! It's easy how quickly you can change back to that person you were...what do you do. i guess i'll just start praying bc i don't think what i did was wrong it probably just didn't look like i was trying to be a good christian witness... which makes me sad. Good news- my fish are still alive after me being away for 12 hours! I <3 them... Keep me in your prayers and I'll keep you in mine! Elizabeth Jenkins...don't forget we really should room together.

"event","It's the beginning of August and i promised I would change. In a good way! Well...to start myself off on a good foot...is not what happened in the least. I got brought into DRAMA or brought myself into drama once again. Friends lost, Friends gained. Although a friend and I talked it over and I decided..I can be better than all this and focus my attention on God...rather than other things. Jesus can litterally be our sword and shield and I learned that in a AWESOME way this week. It was once said that we as Christians ""hate what we do"" which is completely true in this case. So I have asked for forgiveness...although it hurt me I should have never gotten involved. He was a part of my past not my future. I screwed up again...but its awesome to know that one person forgave me! And now I must forgive myself and stop talking about it. Try to get over it, too.

"event","Last night was fun...Jec me, Kelsey Moore, and Keri Payne all went out to eat for sushi...my first time. Then we went to the Parkway Place Mall in Huntsville. Chad Ward and Chris Bagget met up with us there. (A part of my past.)Its crazy how you can't let it go sometimes. And maybe you shouldn't let go of people. I just know it made me stumble. And yes, I know its not there fault for me stumbling, its my own because I'm not strong enough. But, I will begin getting stronger and then hanging out with them every now and then. 
I love having lj bc it feels like an accountablity partner...when ppl comment. I really need help. Jec and I have finnaly rekindled our friendship, but I still don't think we will be best friends. :( I really love her.
I have also learned here lately that if you love someone. Tell them no matter how small the love is...You don't know if they will be here tommorow. 
I have been speeding through my quiet time to get back to my Laguna beach dvd's (all episodes of which i have seen). I need to take it slow. And really comprehend what it says.
                            Thanks for listening...

"event","Well...Sorry I haven't updated last night and today...I feel like I'm doing something wrong! Yesterday was insane. all day Ashley and I worked on our paper. ALL DAY! I finnaly finished and I'm hoping for a ""c""!  I only have two more classes left in my His 202 class. I def. think i passed! I start Speech 106 on the 19th...Blah. School Starts the 10th. Not fun. I can't wait to go to college. Last night was good. When we finnally put on clothes besides pj's after  24 hours it felt so much better. We went to church and saw everybody. We also got these sheets of paper called ""heart search"" wow! you would never know what all you do untill you really search yourself. i'll be doing that for the next few days. I really enjoyed that and daniel-the youth minister gave us these cards that told us special things about us and how much he enjoyed us! It was great. Today I am going to class, tan, home, bed!
                                 I <3 laguna beach...but i dont' think i'm gonna like this all Kristin thing.

"event","Wow...last night was incredible. Ashley Nolen, Courtney Brown, and I went to Joe's Crab Shack (umm) and then we went to Cheesecake Factory for dessert! Her mom took CRaZy pics of us and it was soooo much fun! I love those girls. I really think Courtney and I will become good friends this year. And, last night we had a very personal and intimate time of just sharing and talking. My theory-you surround yourself with positive ppl. Positive will be your outcome. I am praying about going on a mission trip that she is this summer!
                              Luv Rhe
off writing that paper."

"event","hey i'm going to start off my lj with this. Last night after going to a wonderful worship service in Cullman, I spent the night with one of my freinds Ashley Nolen. We stayed up untill 2 talking, knowing that i had work this morning at 6:30. Our original plans were to go work out before my work started. Which would mean that we would have to get up at 5 but instead we got up at 6:15 and I had to get ready for work in the car! God showed me somethings yesterday...Kyle Reno gave our sunday school lesson yesterday and spoke of Samuel begin only 9 years old. Saying to God ""speak Lord your servent is listening"" God blessed him! Wow and to think that a 9 year old boy could have that much courage! Also in church with Dr. Fred Wolfe I felt like i was experiencing God in a new way. He really opened my eyes to forgiveness. See i didn't know where my anger was coming from. I really do think that God put that anger in my heart because I had so much unforgiveness in my heart that I didn't even know about. So I forgave her. The hardest person to forgive. he also told us that just because we forgive it doesn't mean we agree...and that i do not. I dont' agree at all with what she has done but its forgiven and over with. I don't even think i need to bring it up anymore. I have a lighter heart now!
                      Luv Yall

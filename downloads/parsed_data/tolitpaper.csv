"event","<font size=""-2"">So.. monday and tuesday I trained this new girl as a hostess.. after an hour I was completely tired of her. All she did was talk about everything that happened to her since she could walk. I couldnt take it. I dont understand at all why girl's have babies so young. She just turned 17 and due to have a baby in December. anyway.. 

I was laying in my bed this morning. just before i got up to get ready for class.. I over hear my dad, brother, and his friend talking.. and one of them asked my dad this ""did she cry?"" at that momment i  was hurt but at the same time really proud of myself. The reason being.. last night I was sitting in my room watching tv.. my dad is drunk and comes to my door and yells at me to get in the living room so he can talk to me.. so i go its 11pm, im gonna finish this movie and go to bed. He then says ""No you're not, you're going to get your ass in here and we are going to talk"" So i tell him we can talk later. He refuses tho and continues to tell me right now get in here. So i sit there trying not to cry so he wouldnt know that i was hurt by any of his actions. to show him I wasnt weak.. and he tells me that who do I think I am, a badass or something that cant talk to her father. and i sat there silently until he left from rambling on.

<b>5am. I arrive @ her Aunt's house.

530am. I arrive back home & get in bed.

<blockquote>He asks where Cassie is @ and I tell him how I dropped her off @ her Aunt's house. He refuses to belive me & he starts yelling @ me that she is in my house. I tell him no I took her home. Then he tells me he is going to charge me for all this stuff. Because Cassie lied to him & told him I was her step sister. So I tell him where I dropped Cassie off @. It was so late tho and I was so tired I told him the wrong way and didnt relize it till about 10 mins later so I call 411 and get the police department number and then get the cop to call me so I can tell him. He answers the phone saying ""Cassie"" and I like no this is Shelley. He was like oh ok. I told him how I gave him the wrong directions and retold him the right ones. He tells me he is in the driveway and I say ok and he hangs up.</blockquote> 

<b>6am. I go back to bed.</b>

<b>6pm. I go to Cassie's work.</b>

<blockquote>I start talking to Cassie and she tells me the cop never came to her house last night and never spoke to her after I had picked her up earlier. she tells me that he had called and left her a message to call him back. Cassie also tells me her Aunt had called the police looking for her right after I had picked her up. That's when the cop told her aunt that Cassies step sister ""me"" had picked her up. Cassie's aunt tells the cop that she doesnt have a sister that drives. So that was when the cop called in my plates, got my address and came to my house looking got Cassie, so he could charge her for a curfew violation.</blockquote>

We walked around and took pictures. saw some really cool fish. & a really cute sea otter.. he really liked me. it was like an instant connection. but anyway walkign up and down hills got annoying so we stopped & got some lemonaide.. then Jared pushed me in a bush and i fell on the ground and scratched myself up alittle bit, but i got back up and we continued walking. then after awhile Jared got thirsty and he asked what i did with the lemonaide.. and well i didnt have any idea what happen to it but i think i prob dropped it when i fell in the bush. ldjhfdo it sucked.. but we kept walking and taking pictures and bullshitting about wild goats. then we stopped and laid down a blanket and we just chilled there.. it was awesome. then 5pm came and the park was closing so we left and went to this place called extra billy's.. it wasnt all that great but i had a fun time there... then we chilled some more.. jareds car started being dumb so thats when i left and journeyed home from the great day.

"event","<font size=""-2"">I tried thinking. but failed at doing that.. so now i guess well i dont know. blah.. i also had a crazy ass dream last night. i was DRY-humping a big black lady in the butt & pulling her weave out at the same time. anyway.

its raining outside. p-time is over. theres a few things around my room i need to pick up. my night sucked all last night until jared got online and made me smile by being him. i love the friendship we have! it is better than a box of fruity pebbles.

the reason my night sucked.. well when i got home my dad was a complete dick about everything. drunk/high and whatever else he was doing.. anyway he told me how worthless i was.. how my family loved me but not who i was.. he bitched about me going to see Matt in TN.. but i think im slowly becoming a stronger person from all his rants and raves @ me.. i dont cry as much anymore and i dont take anything he says about what he thinks of me to heart anymore. because i know that i am a good person.. and i know that i will make it somewhere in life no matter how much he trys to stop me from growing up. ive been through so much shit in the past and i think getting away from his ass will be the last major shit ill have to get through. and i cant wait till that day comes.


<b>I keep your picture by my side
in my heart is where you hide
holding you so close, you feel my heart beat
i want to tell you how you are so amazinly sweet
and i start to think of what we may be
a simple kiss of the highest degree 
i begin to smile like never before
i love this feeling but wish it was 10 times more
my eyes shut as i begin to dream
a dream of you, i want to cream
you make my life so complete
that i never have a problem falling asleep.
with your picture by my side.</b></font>"

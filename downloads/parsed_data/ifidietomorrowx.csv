"event","Why is my past now attacking my present.?? I can't stand it anymore. Sometimes I just want to jab a knife into my fucking heart. My parents don't even know I exist at some points. And all they do is bitch and whine at eachother and threaten to get a divorce. And then they say I don't care about them. But no.. when I try to explain what's wrong with me, they boo me away and tell me I need to see the therapist more often and I get threatened to be put in the mental institute. I'm sick of miss communication. And most of my depression is caused from my father. The mother fucker who doesn't care about nothing but his fucking little drugs and his home that is fucking prison and his little whore bitches who suck his dick. He says he cares about me. I fell into his tricks too many times. But not this time. Fuck the mother fucking bitch ass nigger bitch. I feel so <b>lonely</b>. All I want is someone to hold in my arms and have a shoulder to cry on. Someone who understands me. Someone to take long walks with, party, sleep with, cuddle with, kiss. But I don't get that either. Yeah, friends are there for you. But sometimes they aren't. I want someone to love me for who I am. Not someone who says they like me but really says that to a thousand other girls. I wanna be treated different than other girls and I someone that can help me through these crucial hard times. Plz!!! Fuck!!!... Maybe true love doesn't exist. I donno.

"event","AnOtHeR PoEm:

In a state of depression
I try to clear my mind
Sanity is  barely visible
Common sence is hard to find
The pain is so unbearable
Sometimes I want to die

All that I can do is lay in bed and cry
I need someone to <b>trust</b>
A true friend
Maybe they can help me
Put this suffering to an end

My mind is going blank
My memory turning hazy
If I don't find someone soon
I think I might go crazy

The pain is quickly growing now
I'm feeling kind of weak
Someone needs to be there for me
Love is all I want.. I seek.

I look at the shiny blade
Stained by my defying tears
Thinking about life
And how this would end all fears

I pressed the knife into my wrist
And watched the blood pour out

Laying on the floor with no one by my side
The blood swirled all over my body
My eyes were very shady
I felt weaker.
Finally.. My pain is all over."

"event","Poems I made lastnight:

<u>Incomplete</u>

The anger that is forced upon this world
The silence of my tears spilling down
My cheeks
Can anyone hear my sighs.?
My screams.?
The razor blade cutting
Through the layers of my defying skin
The black blood spilling through

Can't it be anymore perfect.?
The lies spilled upon this uneventful life we take
With all the tears that I cry everynight
It feels like my life has been nothing but a lie

The memories past upon us all
Nothing is right
Maybe it's just a lie
So <strike>incomplete</strike>

[This poem doesn't have a name]

Break me from the bloody
Chains you bound me in
Hold me deep beneath the surface
And never let me go

Close the gates
Of the torn exits
Hold me tight
Don't let me go

Life is bullshit
It's just another
Opprotunity to
Break the bleeding hearts

Will you do this to me.?
Or will you hold me 
And not let go.?

Let go of everything
but the past
Of everlasting
memories..

"event","There's this guy.
Who lives very far away from me.
Last night I gave it some thought.
What if we one day met.
How would things turn out.?
I want to meet him so badly.
But will I ever.?
And..
How does he feel about me.?
Am I moving too fast.?
I'm so confused.
I guess I just have to wait.
And see how he feels.
And how things turn out.

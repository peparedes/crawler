"event","I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it everyday
I couldn't help her
I just watch her make
The same mistakes again

What's wrong, what's wrong now
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

(Chorus) 
She wants to go home but nobody's home
That's where she lies broken inside
No place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes broken inside

Open your eyes (open your eyes)
And look outside 
Find the reason why (why)
You've been rejected (you've been rejected)
And now you can't find
What you left behind

Be strong, be strong now
Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs, where she belong

(Repeat Chorus)

Her feeling she hides
Her dream she can't find
She's losing her mind
She's fallen behind
She can't find her place
She's losing her faith
She's fallen from grace
She's all over the place (yeah!)

(Repeat Chorus)

She's lost inside, lost inside (oh, oh uhh)
She's lost inside, lost inside (oh, oh uhh) oooh

I should have been online! I would have had someone to talk to but ya know what the craziest thing happened. I went to watch the tv and I was like ""wow a couch I think I'll lay down!"" And I fell asleep for a little while it was crazy I tell you. Insane shit. My head feels funny. I'm listening to jennifer paige. I like this song. It's just (uh) some little thing (crush) not like I faint every time we touch. Or something like that yeah so lala... Can you even see my roses? Maybe I did it wrong I don't know I can see my roses and I love them. I had blood before. And then I had rain but I think I'm going to stick with roses for now because I like them. Or I could have a bleeding rose in the rain and have them all together but I didn't see anything that was like that so oh well. Well I also had this cool looking (to me) autreyu one but I chose the roses. Yeah I'm all hyper whenever I go to write these lately I get like BAM POW engery hyper. It's effing insane I tell you. Crazy. Maybe it's the music i don't know But I'm typing like shwabam and I keep thinking I'm spelling everything wrong so it would take less time if I typed at normal speed and didn't keep stopping to make sure I'm spelling things right and I'm even deleting and re-typing the things I spell write this is nuts. wow. I can't breathe. tickle tickle. It's just some little thing not like everything I do depends on you (sha la la la sha la la la) woo I wonder how long this is going to be. I bet no one will take the time to read it it's just a waste because it's just a bunch of stupid rambling but hey it's my stupid rambling so why wouldn't you read it? Cuz ya know I'm just so fucking awesome :-). haha not but thats okay its fun to pretend sometimes. ya know? I like pretending sometimes cuz then I don't have to pay attention to how i really feel because I'm focussing on what I'm pretending instead of paying attention to reality. yup lala... Now I'm listening to Mandy Moore candy I used to love this song and all her songs it was insane. Now its kind of annoying but its making me hyper she makes me want to kill someone or stab something. crazy crazy. smoke smoke smoke... smoke looks kool. weeeeeee. Okay I'm done updating now... lala... I'll update again later. ByE!"

"event","Well I saw you with your hands above your head 
Spinning around, trying not to look down 
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground 
Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes 
And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before 
And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though 

You're the only one who 
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 

And I probably forgot to tell you this 
Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar 
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel? 
See you're not what I expected 
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me 
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree 

You're the only one who 
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 

I hope you can forgive me for that time 
When I put my hand between your legs 
And said it was small 
Cuz its really not at all 
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down 
Just to keep you around 
Cuz the day you realize how amazing you are 
You're gonna leave me 

You're the only one who 
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 

You're the only one who 
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 

Exactly what I mean 

Well I saw you with your hands above your head 
Spinning around, trying not to look down

          Well today has been an okay day I guess. Matt is here which is good, I think he's the only reason I'm ever happy. Hes so sweet. Mike came over today at 6:00 right when I woke up and I don't know why he felt he needed to come over that early but whatever we ended up going swimming. Swimsuits make me feel ugly and Matt kept tickling me. Silly silly. I met Noah today. Mike wanted me to meet Noah. He was nice. Very... different and polite and nice and un-perverted. Then Matt drove us back to my house around 10:30 and we went back to sleep for a little while. Jessika is mad at me for something but I don't know what it is her and Zane arent fighting anymore which is good. She is at Zanes house right now I think. I wish she were here. My Jess-o-rama-lama. I still don't know where that name came from. It's the mysterious nic-name that just popped out of nowhere. I'm sad. Like this>> :-( Matts trying to make me like this>>:-) but it isnt working very well right now. Usually works well. He has nice hands so soft. Err everytime I think of how soft his hands are it makes me think of the umm tickle situation and then I get all yeah.. well so... fun fun... bored.. bleh... I don't even know. I don't know why I update. I dont know why I put any effort into writing in this shitty journal. rawr.I wonder if Lauren still needs to talk to me. Or if she even wants to. eh..

I don't think this is going to be a very good summer. Jessika and Zane are fighting about something that I don't remember what it is. Sex will not fix this problem. I went to the mall today. Bought pants. Then left. Got home. Put pajamas on. Couldn't fall asleep. Hevent slept since Thursday because i was afraid of a spider. Pretty pathetic but it scared me. So I read instead.

Well not to much has been happening lately. Zane and Jessika got into a fight a few days ago while they were here and like most of their fights they solved it with sex. If only it was that easy for me to solve fights. I would never be sad. But matt doesn't want to have sex and that is perfectly fine with me. I'm so bored right now I think I could die. I'm making Matt want to sleep. I wait for him to not sleep and now I'm making him want to sleep. Well I'm going to go hang out with Matt now so he wont want to sleep. Write more later. Bye"

"event","Well today was an interesting day. It was fun I guess. Didn't think about anything sad until about 10 minutes ago so its been good. Jessika and Matt are here. Jessika is playing with Billy's game thing and Matt is sleeping as usual. Today Matt(brother)'s friend is staying with us for a few days. He broke his leg. Hes hott. Very. And today he had to take a bath type thing with his leg sticking out of the tub. And he couldn't reach the soap. So he said ""can someone get me the soap?"" and me and Jessika like raced each other to the bathroom. And I went in there and gave him the soap and I felt stupid cuz I stood there staring at him for like 10 minutes. I'm such a dumb head. Goodness. Then when he got out of the shower I kept looking at him. I feel stupid. He probly thinks I have some sort of staring problem. Saw Kaide today. I think hes mad at me. I would understand why. Well I'll write more later. Heres an Entry I wrote like 2 days ago or something.

-------

Yeah well alot has happened the last few days. Some good things some bad things. I've been hanging out with Erik alot lately. He is awesome. I got a summer job working at Eriks dad's car wash. I have to wear a white shirt cuz thats what color the shirts are and Johnny and Shawn always squirt me with the hose :-(... at least it's a job and I wont be bored all summer. Something bad happened Yesterday but I'm not going to write about it because it's none of online personels business because no one would even know who she was so i guess it doesn't even matter if I wrote about it or not. Matt and I broke up again. But now we're going back out again. Hes sleeping on the floor next to me. He looks cute when he sleeps. We were at the mall a few days ago and some guy walks up to him and out of nowhere punches him and he just stands there and then we were walking over to talk to Vada and he was all like ""hey wanna fight punk"" and matt was just like.. umm... i was going to talk to Vada. And he was like pshh and walked away I didn't understand it. Whatever. I think I make Erik sad. He hangs out with me but I think when he does I make him sad. And I don't like that. And when Matts around hes even more sadder. Whatever. Confusing stuff. I'm crying now... not because the Erik thing but the thing that I'm not going to talk about because its none of your fucking business and yeah... sad. I've listened to I miss you by various artists about a thousand times. Billy is home. And high. And he just touched my boob. :-/ anyway I think I'm going to go now. Bye"

Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you
Look into the mirror who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today (yeah)

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

Chorus:

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you said so
You can buy all the make up
That M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out, who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm being stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me (hey)

I kept saying sir on accident until finally i just stopped talking. Erik is sitting on my couch I can't tell if hes sleeping or just sitting with his eyes closed. He has the most awesome hair in the world. He should win a fucking best hair award. I shaved my legs. They are smoothe. I wore a shirt today. Got asked to bend over like 8 times. Got the chance to slap everyone who asked too! And Erik being the nice wonderful person he is, hating a certain fag named Josh, hit Josh for asking such a rude degrating question. It was silly."

I woke up late cause I fell asleep on Kaide because he came over last night and watched a movie with me because i couldn't fall asleep and we both ended up sleeping in so I didn't go to school and he didin't work so we just hung out and shit all day. Fun fun! Kaide is one awesome person yes. His hottness me lovah. mm hmm. I went to his ex girlfriends house with him because I thought he should apologize for hanging up on her and ya know what? She is a very horrible person. Yes horrible makes me mad cause Kaide is so nice. Jessika came over and was asking me a bunch of question then all of a sudden shes like ""AALIAH! YOU DIDN'T HAVE SEX WITH HIM DID YOU!!!?!!?!?!?!?"" and I was like No Jessika calm down, and she was like ""what a relief I'm sorry I have to do this but your never allowd to have sex again I'm sorry"" and I was like I hope your kidding! and shes like nope I'm not going to have a pregnant daughter I'm to young to be a grandma. and I was like your not my mom and shes like try telling your father this! I couldn't stop laughing. Then she goes to kaide and says ""boy you get my daughter pregnant I'll beat you with my um.. my... vodka bottle! ya hear?"" and hes like yes mam. It was silly. You probably had to be there though. SO I was like no sex? and shes like never. And Kaides like ""never! thats crazy!"" and Jessikas like ""Well maybe... depends on who shes planning on having sex with"" and then I starting rubbing Kaide and I was like ""well... MOM how about this lovely boy right here?"" and shes like ""no sorry he wont do"" and hes just like ""WHAT?! WHY NOT? NO FAIR!!"" and shes like ""fine you can have sex with him"" It's been a very silly day. Talks about sex. Took lotsa pictures. Skateboarded (hurt my finger), lotsa making out, and kind of alot of yelling. Not bad yelling though. My throat hurts. Well Kaide is going to be back soon and I have nothing else to write about so I am going to go. Bye. I might be back at 1:30 if I'm awake. Love yaaaaz"

"event","Well today was an interesting day. Yes it was. I had to wear a white skirt to school today cuz we were going on like a field trip thing and I had to wear a white skirt and a white shirt I could have worn white or beige but I only had white. My white skirt was really short but I guess it didn't matter cuz I didin't get in trouble. Well we ended up getting soaked by the other schools that were there cuz it was for this thing and they had water guns I don't know. And so my white turned to clear which didn't really matter but all day people were pointing out that they could see my black thong thinking I didnt know! Dumbasses. This one girl Kylie was wearing a hot pink bra and she looked pretty funny got all white on then you see her hot pink bra cuz she was wet. Then we got back to school and I missed the bus so I had to walk home and I live like a half hour away. And Matt was nice and walked home with me. I got beeped at :-( I felt violated. Not really but oh well anyway. He didn't walk home with me he more like carried me home cuz I was lazy and my feet hurt cuz of my stupid shoes. And then I got beeped at even more because my thong was sticking out. Perverted people I tell you. Theres something about guys and the triangle part of some thongs because Matt was holding on to it for some reason which is what other matt and joe always used to do. I find it very weird. Jessika was at my house with Jon (Billy's friend) and Billy. Jenna is staying at my Aunts until May 28th I believe. Thats nice. Anyway I got home and I was finally dry and I changed and all that stuff. Matt was still here when I got out and I was kinda hoping he would be gone cuz I was getting kinda sad being around him and then Jessika pulled me into the other room and was telling me how much Matt still liked me and I felt like crying and then screaming. Then what wasnt supposed to happen yesterday that I still can't say what it is because that wouldn't be to good for Jessika I don't think happened again and again I was thinking why? But I can't deny the fact that I loved it! Well I don't really have anything left to say at the moment so i think I'm going to go back to talking with jon and laying with jessika. She is a very comfortable person to sleep on. Mm hmm. Sorry I couldnt come back on Lauren Jessika didn't want to wake me up. I'll write again later I guess."

"event","lala... I told Lauren I'd update so by golly I'm gonna update! I feel all lonely again. The loneliness left when Jessika got here yesterday. and now shes acting weird. and the lonelieness came back. I love jessika. very much.in lotsa ways. Well in 2 because i think theres only 2 ways. Well actually I like her in 3 ways because I think theres 3 ways cuz I just thought of a new way to like someone and I indeed like Jessika in this way. Jessika loves me! woo! one is the loneliest number! Now shes singing to me. silly girl. and now shes talking about boobs again. shes so very silly. i love her <3. jessika oh jessika she makes me very happy. She makes me wish I was Zane. Nit i wouldnt be an ass. Jessika oh jessika. Like my song?! of course you do damn it cuz i made it all by myself. I just sneezed. i could have died! That would have been sad. very sad. i dont wanna die. well not right now. jessika looks sad. bring up hott guys and she gets sad. what the hell is going on!? something weird.. i want um... something... and i cant have it and is not fair. not fair at all. and now i think i know how a certain person felt a little while ago. damn it. :-o that wasnt supposed to happen. i dont think that was a good thing. uh oh and now i cant even say what happened! so maybe i should just delete what i just wrote so no one asks questions but then what i say next would make no sense. WHY?! WHY THE FUCK NOW? DAMN IT! well. that sums up all my questions about that. jessike jessika jessika MY jessika <3 i love her yes. and now i have to  go and do what wasnt supposed to happen again. Lauren ill try to be back at 1:30. Jessika is sleepin over so she'll be back with me."

"event","Well I'm just here with Zane and Jessika. But zane is sleeping hes like matt i tell you! Anyway so I guess I'm only with Jessika. Today I wore a shirt with a black fish net type shirt under it but you know what!? It's really hott so I took the shirt off so now im wearing a bra and a fishnet shirt thing. I feel naked! hehe. Jessika isnt wearing ANY shirt. none at all. She must feel real naked. sexxxxxxxy. Jessika is being silly. Tongues tickle. Well i was reading this here thing and dairy queen is celebrating the 100th anniversery of the cone! woohoo! Anyway I wanna do something. But then I'd feel real bad and I think putting this might raise a few questions amoung certain people that I wont be able to answer to anyone but I need something to write about because I have nothing to write about. ZANE LOOKS REALLY FUCKIN CUTE WHEN HE SLEEPS! arg! He so cute and so is Jessika theu're so cute together. NO FAIR!! I want Jessika! Shes mine mine mine!! I told Zane today that if Jessika didn't care so much about him I would cut off his penis and choke him with it (no i would never but i couldnt think of anything else) but yeah and then I could have Jessika. And ya know what he said?! He said I'll share her with you. And ya know what?!!?!?!!?! That didnt sound like much of a bad idea until I thought about a few things and people and stuff. Jessika was all for it! Then I brought up a certain 3 people and she said yeah it might not be the best idea. I think i should go out with a girl!! Boys don't seem to work to well for me. But I don't think I like many girls in that way. Well actually I know I don't. I think I like um... 3. hmm.... I LIKE MATT!! But thats over. and i like joe and brad and chris and Jon and mike and chad and other matt and trent and eligh and billy and greg. but those are all over!!! over over over! and they're all boys!! I miss Joe. he doesn't even talk to me anymore. How rude! Well he talks to me sometimes. But that question always seems to pop up. Will you go out with me. but I always say no and I don't even know why because joe is awesome but I just have like a no reflex when it comes to Joe. Maybe I should change this reflex to a YES! But I don't think that would work because I get jealous of Joe and stuff and I'm not even going out with him because when hes places theres always those like 4 annoying girls trying to hang on him and touch him. WHY IS HE SO DAMN SEXY?! I just don't know and I don't think I ever will. But thats okay. I think I'm going to stay single for awhile. ya know unless Zane and Jessika break up. Or Zane mysteriously dissppears and is found dead with his penis in his throat. (eww) But I don't think either of those will happen so hell. JESSIKAS LOOKING AT MY BOOBS! LESBIAN LESBIAN LESBIAN!! hehe I'm retarded who am I to talk!? boob is a funny word dont ya think. I think its a very funny word. Kinda like fork. and Vagina. Vagina sounds kinda like CHINA!!! It sickens me. Not really vagina vagina vagina I am the proud owner of a VAGINA!! wooo!!! Penis is a funny word too in a way. Zane has a penis!! and we know he uses it because HE ALMOST GOT JESSIKA PREGNANT!! BAD!! hehe lala... Jessika is super! I LOOOVE her she is like... shes Jessika. Yeah thats it. And I love Lauren too because she is super kool and she even has HER OWN FUCKING HEART!!! WOOOHOOO!!! 3> --<<see right there that is Laurens very own special heart because she is indeed special and I love her more than I love my left tit! I don't know why... but I've always wanted to say that. I'm not weird! am i!?! are you lying?! I'm wearing a skirt. and when I bend over you can see my butt! woo! I like MY butt and I cannot lie. Actually no i don't but hell other people seem to! PERVERTS!!! Jessika likes my butt. Do you like my butt? you do dont you dont deny it! heh bored... I dont think I'll be bending over anytime soon. nope most definately not. Billy is super cool also like all the other peopel I have mentioned in this lovely journal entry. BUT ITS ALL BILLYS FAULT!! ALL BILLY!! Hes the reason I felt guilty the mostest but I'm all better now. Wanna know whats fun!? Making out with people. Wanna know why?! Because tongues feel kinda funny I think. I wanna makie out with you! Yes you! Even thoug I don't know If I know who you are. But hey maybe I do want to make out with you. Maybe even secretly and you just don't know it because I don't wanna tell you and seem weird. I love Lauren I love Lauren. I would like to make out with 1391823091823091 people before I die. Maybe it would be a special record! and I'd be all like ""woohoo I made out with the most peo.. *dead*"" yes thats how it would happen. But I don't think its going to happen. Wanna know how I feel right now? I feel fuckin slutty. But that is okay because its not even a bad feeling of sluttiness its a good woohoo look at me I can go have sex with anyone and I wouldnt even feel slutty after because I already feel slutty! woo! Jenna is here. NO! no high-ness. She hurts. ""down there"" I think If I had a hole and a piece of metal there it would hurt too. i would NEVER get my clit pierced. I don't think owwy owwy ow ow. Hehe... Jenna has her owwy pierced... Billy has/ had his owwy pierced. Matt had/ has his owwy pierced. WHATS UP WITH THE OWWY PIERCINGS! I ASK! HOW PAINFUL HAS THAT GOT TO BE!? There putting a fucking hole in you which hurts no matter where it is BUT DOWN THERE?! What if something got stuck on it and ripped out. Oww thinking of that hurt. real bad that sounds like it would hurt. I wanna be a super-millionaire!! sounds like fun. I think I should be a stripper!! *ahem* an exotic dancer is what I meant. I probably wouldnt make any money though people would be all like ""whos the ugly fat chick up there? why the hell would you hire her.? what? are you crazy"" yeah thats how they would be because I am fat and ugly. Jessika. Jessika would make a wonderful exotic dancer. 1. she can dance exotically. and 2. she is sexy! and not fat. 2 things I am not. She is wonderful. I think some other peopel I know would make good strippers too but I don't really know beccause I don't know if they can dance! I think Zane should be a male stripper. Hed be like all hott and male-stripper-ish. Yeah hott! Well I think I am going to go now so I'll try and write again soon. Lauren if you read this I'll try to be back at 1:30 I love you! bye"

"event","Seriously, pretend you are a fireman driving the firetruck down a road that not 1/4 mile prior it was flooded two feet deep when you come across two people pushing a car. Do you really think blaring your horn at them is going to really affect them and make them move? If you want a little more background, here we go. It is currently pitch black, in the middle of the night, you are being dispatched to save somebody from a less mobile fate and there is NOBODY IN THE FUCKING ROAD!! The answer as TWO firetrucks found out, is no.

I call it fate. We decided, for some reason, not to finish the NTN game at Buffalo Wild Wings and go home. We turn onto Cedar and I see the road is really badly flooded. I stay toward the middle of the road since it is the highest elevation. I see my friend's car get swept off to the deep end by an 18 wheeler's wake in the water. They are now in  two and a half feet of water. I pull off and help push them to a near by gas station. I offer to give them a ride home. On my way to dropping off the first person, we hit yet another patch of deep flood, just this time there is no high ground. There is just water. Lots of fucking water. Go Apple Valley. Once we push my car out of the deep water I manage to get my car to turn over, but it wont stay in gear. Obviously so, it was flooded. I kept it running so it would evaporate the water as we pushed. As a side benefit we also had some smashing tunes! We get over to a nearby scrubway and park my poor asphyxiated car. The others start walking to their houses. I stay with my car. After some high RPM loving I manage to get the water evaporated and the car to live. I drive home. :)

I call everybody to make sure they are all safe and proceed to change my clothes. By the way, when you push cars in not only flood conditions, but rainy flood conditions, you get wet. Good thing it was warm out or I would have prolly started to hyperventilate. Wouldn't that have been a fun thing to explain to work? They would still probably give me an occurrence. Fuckers.

Okay, Time for me to let the adrenalin high wane then go to sleep. In the words of Eddie Izzard, ""Chao."""

"event","I remembered from somewhere that, when you exercise your brain releases dopamine and makes you feel good. After being in a D+ mood for over a week, I decided I would give it a try: I decided to play DDR until I couldn't play anymore. 

So I started playing...and playing...and playing. Several hours later and twice through the song list of DDR Extreme JP Home Edition, I got bored and gave up. 

It worked to an extent. It brought my mood from a D+ to a C+. I was just hoping for more of an A-. Ah well. This did teach me that I won't get tired from playing 7's and 8's no matter how long I play (or at least three hours straight).

On the rather plus side I get over $600 back from taxes. w00t"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Parental Advisory: Explicit Content"">I don't remember where I heard this saying, but it is a good one; there are three kinds of intercourse: 'making love,' 'sex,' and 'fucking.' For different people these can mean different things. As an example, making love for a hippie is the physical manifestation of their love for another, whereas making love for a redneck is their physical manifestation of thinking with the wrong organ at the closest thing with something similar to a reproductive organ. To me these represent different methods for emotional construction. Think of it this way; if a builder from MN started building a house in CA they would quickly find the tornado-proof house would come tumbling down when the first earthquake hits. When they see the problem occurring, they will change designs to accommodate the area. For the sake of simplicity, I am going to stick with heterosexual sex descriptions (mainly because I don't know anything about non-hetero sex (the real stuff, not the cheap porno version)). The three versions of sexual intercourse have different meanings in society's different niches, but this is how I see it.

Making Love. Not may people hear this term anymore. Honestly, it <i>does</i> sound quite corny and cliche. When was the last time you looked into the eyes of your partner and put all your heart and soul into the three words, ""Let's make love."" Now, that is not to say it doesn't happen and that there isn't a time and mood for verbiage like that, but the vast majority of the medically-healthy-enough-for-sex are never going to use that phrase in their lives and if they do their significant other will either laugh at them or soon leave them. I kinda find that to be disheartening. I, being a hopeless romantic, am entranced by the idea that you can love somebody so much that you need to go past the verbal and go into such physical displays of love. Most people in their lives are going to find somebody they want to spend the rest of the time they have left with somebody who means something to them. Does that mean they found their love? What about when they get divorced, widowed or get bored? What about the other people who don't find a person they want to spend their lives with? Is that going to make them stop having sex? Fuck no!

Something you have probably heard at some point in your lives, ""Sex is hereditary: if your parents didn't do it, chances are you wont either."" This phrase probably made you throw up a little in the back of your mouth. The sheer thought of your parents going at it was probably horrifying. It may still be horrifying. But it also gave you a little bit of curiosity about sex. You hear all of your life that you need to wait for marriage to have sex from your 'role models,' but the role model your parents sat you in front of every day made sex out to be a trendy thing. This role model taught all of us that sex doesn't need to have any strings attached. There is no need to see the person you had sex with last night the morning after. They were probably cheating on their significant other with you. Same as you, right? Fuck sanctity in marriage! With divorce rates climbing all the time, it is obvious people don't hold marriage in the same esteem they used to. Why should sex be held to the old standard when the whole reason you were 'saving yourself' was for an institution that doesn't have the symbolism it once had. This, together with other reasons, are why many people believe there is such a thing as 'casual sex.' The concept that you can put a man and woman together, have the mail insert into and retract his penis from the woman several times over, along with other interesting actions with none of the emotional baggage. A dream come true for many men and women alike. Why not satisfy the urge without conforming to the old societal standard? Why not take it a step further and go back to your base desires? That's easy: the new social standard. Hmph. But what if that changed?

Something the teens and young adults, with their angst swimming in hormones, have thought to no end, ""I just wanna fuck somebody!"" Resulting from extreme sexual tension and frustration these people almost turn feral, while they are fighting the urge to break society's rules and fulfill the instinctual need to procreate, and turn to each other to alleviate the 'pressure.' In this, there is no love. There is no curiosity. There is only that last piece of their young, newly developed mind that has not be molded into the current human society. This is not to say only young people do this. There are plenty of people who want to 'just fuck,' that are older than them. And why not? When a person has no outlet for their pent up sexual energy it turns to frustration and as *most* everybody knows: masturbation doesn't solve that problem for ever. No matter what the box says, it is not going to be better than the real thing. The thing that sets the young population apart from the rest in this category is they will try new things since they still have the teen angst in them. They are compelled to challenge society at all costs and that will lead to fetishes given birth by the objects of their frustrations. Next time you feel the need to judge you should think about what made the person/people want to do what they are doing. Matt, you should watch the final boss of the internet again and try to think about what would make those people do what they did (while laughing/vomiting).

Most people will go through at least two of these desires. You can start in any of the three. You can start with making love when you have found your Mr(s) right at an early age. Fucking is a starting ground for those who have idle hands where the curious social-sexualites had enough on their plate to keep them busy without stressing them excessively. From each starting ground you will experiment and find you are either meant for that method of sexual relief or that your weather-proof house is collapsing due to an earthquake and move on to find your best position in the sexual world. Just like with anything else, your best bet for making the most of yourself for yourself and others is finding what you are good at and building on that stable ground. Many people will have their opinions on the sexual excursions a person can take. People will say some are bad and others are good. I wouldn't say any of them are inherently <i>bad</i>, but if you take any one of them too far or go into a situation without knowing all of the facts you will end up hurting yourself and/or somebody else. Above all else, the thing you have to remember is: do what makes you happy.

For the record, this is not a Heart Candy Day rant. People should just know I like to talk about random stuff when I am hyper late at night."

I think there are two reasons for my +1 good mood right now; I have been playing Diablo 2 as an escape, and I purchased the Love Hina TV series. That makes me happy.

The other night, I was at Boarders in the manga section. There were these two women talking about the various manga they were reading at the time. The reason I point this out is because they were white and in their 30's. It made me feel good knowing there were women out there who appreciated graphic novels in America who started before I was born. :)

"event","So, I went to the state fair...barely. I say barely because when I got to the park and ride with my friends we found out the bus ride to the fair would cost five dollars. We were not aware of this prior, or we might have chosen another form of entertainment for the night. 

Since I had only just taken some cash from the machine I did not have any fives and buses do not provide change I was going to hop a ride home from the MoA. (note for clarification: in our party of four, there were two men and two women) After I said I was not going to pay $20 to ride to the state fair and started to walk toward the MoA, the bus driver called to me saying, ""I wont have your girl ride and have you walk home. Come on the bus."" I was thinking, ""Damn right, I am not paying that much money to ride the bus."" 

I believe park and rides should be free. The freaking ticket to get in the fair was seven dollars, not to mention the food, drink, ride, game and souvenir costs.

Whatever though. I got to the fair with the peeps. It was...the fair.

When we first got in we noticed an ambulance making rounds...very slowly. I made the comment, ""Let's all walk really slowly in front of an ambulance because other people's lives don't matter to me."" I was called horrible for that.

Later in the day we saw the ambulance going by with its lights going, and guess what? People were walking very slowly in front of it not getting out of its way. I pointed this out and referenced my previous statement and was called horrible again.

Alrighty, that's my anecdote for the time being."

For a person who never saw the play, but knew the musical score by heart, I feel let down. Many of the questions that I had were not answered and I feel the director made poor choices on what to cut and to change. The worst part of it was they cut too much of the feeling in the show by making PG-13. They even made Bennie into a total villain. Fuck that.

"event","<lj-cut text=""With fewer drunken antics than expected"">The day started off with waking up to my dad thinking I should go to work. So I get ready since I did tell Ryan I would meet him at his house at 11:00am. I get a text from him saying ""Bww 1115."" Not sure what that meant, but I assumed it meant be at his apartment at 11:15. Not a bad thing since I was running late anyway. 

So I get to his apartment, we go out to collect the parts to try and fix his Pop'n controller, we get the parts and fail at repairing the controller. Well yay! At this point we decide to play some Mario Party. We have to stop in the middle of it so we can get Ryan to his girlfriend's house by 2:45. That is done and I finally receive the voice mail from Doug saying we should hang out (fucking Sprint not showing I got calls). 

So we hang out and I am reminded that we had previously made plans for the night. I have to tell Ryan that I will not be able to have the night of drunken Irishness we had planned. So Doug and I wait for party time. Doug gets a call from the host saying the earliest they will be able to have people over is 11:30 and that is if they get back right away. 

So plan A failed. On to plan B. 

We tell John and Amber about the aforementioned failure and they do the obligatory ""WTF."" We ask if they would like to hang out at one of Doug's friends house and watch some good ol' Boondock Saints and get drunk. John returns with, ""I'm tired."" Doug and I do the obligatory ""Well F."" 

Plan B is scrapped. On to plan C, then. 

Doug and I get a call saying our new host has no mixers. Doug and I do the obligatory ""Well F."" We then proceed to Walmart, only to find they do not have the correct mixers. 

Plan C-1 has failed. On to plan C-2.

We go to McDonalds to get some food because we did not want to get too wasted too quickly. At McDonalds we find that even the 14 year olds are drunker than we are at 10:15 pm. We do the obligatory ""WTF."" We get our food and then it is off to Rainbow. At Rainbow we get the pitcher, Koolaid, and juice and then it is off to the party.

We get to the house, warm ourselves up with some preliminary drinks and then it is off to the bigger tv to watch the movie. At this point Doug and I are pretty pissed that we aren't very pissed and want to drink about until we piss blood. SO, we play the ""Fuck"" drinking game while watching Boondock Saints. Let me tell you, it did not take long to get us taken away. After the cat died we couldn't keep track of each time somebody said fuck so we were just trying to drink as often as possible. At about 12:45 Doug realized he had to work in the morning and we left. Before I left I was introducted to an Irish Car Bomb. I must say I liked it a lot more than I though I would. And I guzzled the last of my gin and juice.

So now, you all can understand why I randomly put comments on journal entries, and poor Jason got a long one sided conversation to wake up to. Ah well. I am sure I am not the first/worst/last person to drunkenly IM Jason.

The moral of this story is I have about $60 in alcohal in my dresser that should have been put toward a good party. Whatever. There is always a next time."

Last night I finished helping Ryan move into his new appartment. That went until about 6:00am. We decided to call off our normal DDR because of the lack of sleep that we would have and he said that he would have to take care of his son RJ earlier than usual. 

Friday I woke up at 2:30pm. Normally that is a long time to sleep to, but it was only eight hours of sleep. It's all good though. I was able to hang out with Doug and Olson. That's always good. Then after a while I called Dave to see what was going on. We decided to go driving around for a while since he was going back to Michigan on Saturday. We made a stop at best buy in burnsville and played some Guitar Hero. Always a good time. I did really bad on Ace of Spades. Ah well, that is what happens when you don't play for a couple weeks. After that we remembered we were invited to a party and went there. That was good fun. There were a lot of people that I didn't know, but I got to know them better as the night went on. I played some Twister toward the end of the party. That was a workout. This one girl, Kat, is really good at wearing you out and striking when you least expect it.

After that, I dropped Dave off and went over to Ryan's and played some mario party. I hate mario party seven now. I ended up getting the most stars in that 15 turn game with four! Absolutely worthless. The duels don't even guarantee you a prize. Screw that. I will stick with other mario parties that have a better system in place.

Anywho, I am going to go to sleep.

See you cats later!"

Today's notice is a sad one: My car has been christened with the vomit of ten liquors. My good friend Ryan could not hold back the six Jaeger bombs, one beer and the glass of mysterious green stuff that I made that had a very strong bland taste. I just finished cleaning the car up and fabreezing the hell out of it. Let me tell you that shit was rank. Driving my drunk friends asses has never yielded that foul of an odor. I, honestly, think that much of the blame had to lie with my mysterious green stuff, because when it came back it smelled like all of the liquors I mixed together with nasty pizza, which we also had. :P 

I hope that is the last time I have to go through that. My car was not more than two days old and it had already been vomited in. Karma had better pay me back huge for that one. I should win the lottery!"

"event","Because there were no calls after 4:00pm. I spent four hours eating my subway, drinking free Coke, talking with peeps about how mean the customers were today, eating free snack food(chips and salsa), and enjoying the night.

I think that Football has done a good thing tonight.

However I will be cursing myself when tomorrow comes and there is hell to pay for the few hours of calm tonight.

Ugh...I can imagine it now. The queue will prolly be about 40-50 people deep and they will all be complaining that the store refused to take their huge tv returns.

Whatever though. Now is the time for peace, calm, and Guitar Hero.

Enjoy football day everyone!"

On the plus side I can beat almost any song in Guitar Hero on Hard mode^^

And my DDR-ing has held steady at 8 step songs.

Overall feeling on my gaming skillz: Boo"

"event","I need help finding something to do with my computer. Lately I have used it for nothing more than downloading anime, IM and the occasional livejournal post and read.

I have great aspirations for a new computer that I am going to buy in the near future, but I want to know what I am going to do with it.

Here are some specs for it:

AeroCool AERO-X202 Black Aluminum/Steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case - Retail

ASRock 939Dual-SATA2 Socket 939 ULi M1695 ATX AMD Motherboard - Retail

Rosewill RP550-2 ATX 2.01 550W Power Supply - Retail

AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400+ Toledo 1GHz FSB Socket 939 Dual Core Processor Model ADA4400CDBOX - Retail

CORSAIR XMS 2GB (2 x 1GB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 (PC 3200) Unbuffered Dual Channel Kit System Memory Model TWINX2048-3200 - Retail

Western Digital Caviar SE16 WD2500KS 250GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive - OEM x4

PLEXTOR Black IDE Slot Load DVD Burner Model PX-716AL/SW - Retail x2

Add an All in wonder X1800 XL to it and you have the computer I am making.

I need games that would put a strain on my system. I would like something that is either a FPS that is worth getting and doesn't cost to play online, a RPG that does not cost to play(not a MMO), a new RTS that doesn't suck (I will have the obligatory StarCraft on my computer because that game should be on all computers :P), TBS that doesn't suck, or...something

Otherwise I am going to be doing a lot of DVD burning and video editing...of HDTV...onto my computer...(free TIVO)

So yeah..give me your suggestions"

I am bored of my computer and everything that it has. I am bored of my PS2 and all the games it has. I am bored of my Game Cube and all the Mario Party 7 it has.

Maybe I should look to living things to interact with...Matt?"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Just...super"">I have had the worst week of my life. My girlfriend dumps me because she says she is emotionally unstable and not completely over her last two relationships. Yay! Today I was just betrayed by a friend. Tell me, is it too much to ask to be able to rely on the fact that your friend would be willing to give you a ride home from work? I would give my friends rides home from work, if I had a car. I did give friends rides home from work and school, even when it was an inconvenience for me. 

What the fuck!?

Now all I need is to have you all decide to hate me and it would be the perfect shit on Jeff week.

Whatever...fuck it. I wont let the depression have its way with me. I still have purpose in life despite what the depression thinks."

"event","<lj-cut text=""and the law won"">I was out driving to a friend's house yesterday evening. Going on my merry way I was turning onto Burnsville Pkwy from CR-11 when my car started to spin. I was really confused because the spinning got faster when I took my foot off of the gas. So I decided to enjoy the ride. It was like being on a tire swing and then suddenly stopping. With a crunch. Thinking little of it past I want to get out of the way of traffic I apply some gas to get my car off of the median curb. I get back on the road and find that I am not able to steer well. So I let my car slide into the other curb, turn on my hazards and check out the damage. Here, for you to observe, is the damage:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v512/shinosake_r/car1.jpg"" alt=""Oh shit son!"">       

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v512/shinosake_r/car2.jpg"" alt=""That's not good."">

As you can imagine, I no longer have a working car. I tried to fight physics...and lost. Suprisingly this doesn't bother me that much. I didn't have any real attachment to that car. Now I have to find a now car. One that wont break the bank with financing or insurance."

Here's a note to Yankees fans: Derek Jeter is a mo.
He started groping Knoblauch's balls,
you know the ones that he can't throw.
Chucky went to give him the high five
Derek went down for the ""flesh hello.""

Whoa oh oh

That thing with Mariah Carey, you'll say...
""What the hell was that?""
Male backup dancer heaven, baby
and she's fat.
Now he's down in the village showing guys
how he chokes up AND down on the bat.

Whoa oh oh 

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
The men in black, they like to take it from the back
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
They Suck! They Suck!

Yankees Suck
Yankees Really Suck
Yankees Really Really Suck

Did I already mention that guy Jeter's a little strange?
He's always hangin' round the showers
waiting for guys to change.
On the reacharound
that guys got excellent hands and tremendous range.

Whoa oh oh

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
The men in black, they like to take it from the back

"event","mmm....wow.
matt just left...and we just celebrated out 1 year anniversary. it was wonderful. i had him over for a surprise dinner...that i worked very hard on all day. i made lasagna (none of that prego shit...i made the sauce myself) and it was perfect. i was so worried i wouldn't have everything done in time...but it worked out soo perfect...sparkling grape juice and all. we had a romantic candlelit dinner with the 2 of us...it was nothing short of amazing. 
the rest of the weekend was good too. hung out at OU and matt's house on friday...went to his house saturday afternoon. we took a walk...hopped some fences, trespassed in a construction/hard hat area and ended up at a playground. lol. it was lots of fun. then i babysat for almost 4 hours....but the kids were in bed the whole time. so i got paid $23 to sit and watch tv...not bad. 
i need to work on my AP biology...i do actually want to pass this class...even though my grade wouldn't indicate someone striving for a passing grade.
""Would you be my one true friend
Stick with me through thick and thin
If the roof was old and the rain came in
Honey would you stand by me""

I love you matthew

"event","yeah.....so i basically haven't written in this in like....several months. but oh well. i guess i'll start trying to write in it a little more since it looks friggin' awesome since matthew spiffed it up.
hmm...what's new with me. i'm still desperately seeking a job...and haven't had any luck. school is alright...AP biology is kicking my ass.....majorly. i got a D+ on our first test....yay. i used to think i was semi-intelligent before this class. 
matthew and i will be celebrating our 1 year anniversary a week from today. isn't that amazing?? 
i was really sick last week. i got sick a week from last thursday...and it just sucked. i was crazy sick. then i got pink eye after homecoming. homecoming was awesome...(piercing look) it really was. it was my best year of homecoming.
i can't think of what else to write. hey darcy....your toothbrush now has it's own little labeled bad in the drawer. you are now free to make spur of the moment decisions to sleep at my house anytime.
i love you so much matthew.

<P><STRONG>um....i guess i'll just pick up with prom. i traveled to st. joe on saturday (not this past saturday, last saturday) and finally got to see matthews town. damn it's cute. i loved it so much. finally saw his house....saw his mom again...met his kitty...saw his little-boy bedroom. (tehe) and all that fun stuff. he looked so damn good....&nbsp; we took lots of pictures in his front yard...right in front of a really yummy smelling lilac bush. chris and lindsey arrived (i finally got to meet the wonderful prople i've heard so much about) i adored them instantly and we all went out to dinner at pumphouse grill. it was yummy. then we went down to the pier....lake michigan is beautiful....especially when you're walking on the pier with the one you love most. then we headed to the dance. it was a lot of fun. after the dance we went to chris' house to watch house of flying daggers. we basically all fell asleep....but matthew got me home by 2....just like he promised my mother he would. next morning, me and matt and our mothers went out to breakfast. then i had to put st. joe to my rudder and head home....but i'll be going back on the 28th. hoorah. but that's a story for another entry. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>on friday, matt came home (yay!!) we hung out for a few hours....just chillaxin (haha.....darcy) saturday, me and my sista cleaned out mom's car.... our cheap mothers day gift. then we went to the store to get her some flowers....and decided to go shopping for ourselves as well. tehe. then matt came over....we got our prom pics developed....and got asked if we just got married. oh man did that make me smile. i think it made matt get nervous and anxious for a topic change. we had dinner...played some sims....watched i, robot. then...said goodbye for 13 days. damn. last time we have to be apart for so long. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>sunday, my brother graduated form michigan state college of engineering. i'm so damn proud of him. the ceremony was long and boring...and it was freezing in there. then we had a little reception at our house. it was fun. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>worked at the barn yesterday.....for now pay of course. did a lot of exhausting work with a pride-cut gelding. it was fun though. my baby looked like he's been putting on some weight. oh well though...he's adorable no matter what. </STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>man.... what to say. things really arent too bad right now. some things.... and some people... make me sooo happy.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>saw the school play last night. the best production Mott H.S. has ever put on. and village place was a joy as always. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>guess what everybody! im moving in 3 weeks!!! yay!!!!!!!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>i worked at the barn today. spent a few hours walking with Tootsie (the pony i worked with) and then spent almost an hour in Dusty's stall while he sniffed around for treats in my pockets and i chatted on the phone with the love of my life. sigh* talking to the 2 guys i care most about in the world. sure, one of them stands on four legs and eats hay..... but that doesnt matter. i dont think theyre too jealous of eachother and the fact that they have to share me. although, Dusty did try to bite my cell phone while i was talking to Matt.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>""just little things.... are so beautiful.""</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I love you Matt</STRONG></P>

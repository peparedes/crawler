hello, my name is grace
just who is grace?
well, she's hip. she's square. she sings back up for the rocket summer in the shower & in the car. she takes pictures. she writes stories. she is in love. she loves distance & airplanes. she is a terrible kite maker but an excellent kite flyer. she doesn't believe in absolutes or in saying goodbye. she wishes she wasn't so difficult all of the time. she believes it's okay to be unsure. 
<font size=5>comment & we'll fly kites

<font size=2>hello my name is grace. i brush my teeth in the shower. i live in a world where it's always winter. i think mint green is a really nice colour. i think strangers are the best people to talk to & i think that it's okay to lie sometimes. fruit20 water makes my heart & stomach happy. my ipod & camera are my best friends. dancing in the rain may be the happiest thing ever. and being barefoot. i create art; stories & pictures. i love photographs with crinkley edges & flower fabic [dainty things]. i want an ice skating person & some one to picnic with. i am spontaneous. i am happy. i love camera ; i love books.

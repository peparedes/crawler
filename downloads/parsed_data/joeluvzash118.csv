"event","Well shit. Who would've thought. I sure did'nt. I don't know why i'm using this journal. I dont look at the past. I cant; it hurts too much. But thats alright, I suppose. I doubt anyone would ever even find this. if you do this is my desperate cry out to the world. I dont talk about my problems. I dont acknowledge them there. I cant do anything about them so why make myself upset. I wish shit didnt work out this way everyday but God set this up so what can i do. im just Human. I had other hopes but those didnt work out so well either; Only few would know, but the subject of matter didnt. i suppose i should have came foward with my feelings but a fear i had never felt before sets upon me these days. it haunts me. i guess thats my fault in a way but in a sense if i knew this would happen i never woulda bothered in the first place. I beg for one more tomorrow. I find myself waking up every morning so thats a bright side. my appearance has withered. i dont care. who does? please step foward now. save me.
I will say, i do have good friends. we dont get too deep with eachother. we just live it up and have fun. if there are any problems, we let them go so quickly and forget. But i think im the type to never forget. i dont think anyone really forgets. just ignores perhaps? well we do have a lot of fun together. Theyve been keeping my moral high. its not too deep. who knows if well be together in 10 years. who knows? its great if it happens but if not there isnt that deep obsessive connection that there is with others so theres no pain, just friends with everyone and happiness. Sometimes its hard to live with that mentality because the depression starts to settle. a man gets lonely...
I love you has no meaning.
Im a good guy, a ""nice guy"" and thats what hurts me. thats what really does me over. Where is my fortune. where is my happiness? where is my love? where is my ...everything? where is everything i deserve? i deserve to have someone to care for me and is all about me and who wants me and who realizes what i'd do for them. But that wont happen. Not anytime soon atleast. and thats alright i suppose.
I wish i could go back. I would change a lot. The pain from listening to so many songs..its unbearable.

I just want her to find me. I want her. and Not Her. If she finds me, she finds me, if not, Im around. =/

if any one sees this. Post something. Let me know i'm Live."

Merry Christmas ta everyone<3 Christmas this year was..great yo..so much better than last year without a doubt. and i think my babie Ash agrees. Everythings so good with her and I..im just..In love with that girl yo..fuck anyone and everyone who doubt it. It's been 11 months this month and we're coming up on a whole year yo..I really sometimes cant even believe that she's mine. When i would talk to her last year, it was unbelievable almost because i was just in awe like wow, this girl is perfect. I never thought in a million years that i coulda been with her or her even look at me like that, and though i was thinking that..i knew in my mind i could treat her so much better than she was being treated and i knew in my mind she deserved the whole world and i wanted to give it to her so bad..I Thank God everyday.

and i played a good part, cause now I Love you
and id give you anything and everything cause i trust you
and i never dreamed, that in one night scene
or two, with you, id see all my dreams-Come true
im high, when i see ya face, mentally im in the sky
choke and forget what to say, even if its just hi
i try, keep my cool, but my heart beat skips
you take my breathe boo, when we apart, i weep a bit
like life without you, is nothin but cloudy n worthless
your voice, brings out tha sun, makes the son* shine
make a nigga, sing marvin gay, and without you its my hardest days
cause, its so sweet, bein loved by you, i can honest-ly say

i need you, 
when youre sick i wanna be tha one ta make ya soup n feed you
and i wanna be there for everysmile, every laugh, id never mislead you

I seriously just think about it all the time, just me, down on one knee, lookin up at her, tellin her how so much in love i am with her, and how much i love her and just, asking her..finally..i cant wait. I'm really overprotective of her now..which only some would understand why..just after i came back from bk, i just get soo worried about her all the time, and i just start flippin out, but its cause i love her and i care for her so much, and i just want her ta be okay and safe and happy and good. Thats my lady yo, i hate niggas tryna fuck wit my lady all disrespectin n shit, anyone wanna fuck with her straight up, ima fuckin knock they teeth inta they ass, not frontin..thats just, thats my babycakes<3 I Love her, nd no1 gonna fuck with her..I wish i coulda seen her tonight, i tried to, but Eddie and Tina didn't pick up the fone, =/..and tha moms didnt wanna take me cause she wanted ta pick up suzie from her party thing..so i rolled out wit da moms ta see if shell take me. i ended up watching iron chef wit Joey fuckin eatin roast beef sandwhiches, doing nothing..kinda seemed awkward. i dont know, i feel like he looks down on me, and i dont know why. like next to him i look like a bad kid =/. i dont know. but after that bullshit, we went ta pick up suzie, and wtf happens..i find out mah nigga Matt was there and he asked for me and i was like man thats so fucked. =/ and ta top all that shit off..me and tha moms started beefin on tha way home, bout how i was 'talkin' and 'behaving'. And it got really deep, and she made me feel really shity =[. she said 'oh you think youre better than anyone else? if it wasnt for me being strict on you, youd be out in tha streets all the time fuckin around' and i was like oh wtf im fuckin gettin good grades and shit. and she was just like 'ha okay its just the beginning of the year, you act like u workin ya ass off so hard' and whats really fucked up, is i really am =[ and every1 knows that yo..but i guess if i get good grades or not, its not good enough for her, and i said dat shit ta her..but you know its w.e, she's just pushing me away. she makes me want to move out tha second i turn 18. and i just might. i just want to get out of here, and start my own life, with my babycakes..thats all..

well..i dont feel really good at all..i dont know where my baby is =[ I miss her so much, all i can think about right now is just her holdin me, and her laying, sleepin next ta me, aww man she is the CUTEST thing ever when she sleepin, all in my lap lookin all cute, God she's precious..<3 I Love you baby..so much..im just really in love with her. i cant wait till we get married and have babies and just, till we be with eachother. Honestly thats the only thing that's keeping me going. She asked me taday why i love her so much, and i was just like youre perfect, and i just fell so much in love with you, shes my other half yo straight up, she just thinks exactly what i think, like we finish eachothers sentences, we say shit at the same exact time a lot, she's just..in my eyes, shes perfect. so loving, so caring, so beautiful, smart, funny, cute, just amazing at everything she does, im just..in love with her. makes me happy jus thinkin bout her..i hope shes ok..
well i think ima go, all this emo music makin me really sad n shit, and without my baby here =[ its worse..i feel like nothing really..unappreciated..by tha rents mostly..but i dont know..fuck it..ima just go..=[ pray or something..all i know is one thing tho..id rather be ANYWHERE..with her<3..anywhere but here..

be good..

 I dont think u will
ever fully understand
how uve touched my life
nd made me who I am.
I dont think u could ever kno
just how truly special u are
that even on tha darkest nights
u are my brightest star.
I dont think u will ever fully comprehend
how uve made my dreamz come true
or how uve opened my heart
to love nd the wonders it can do.
Uve allowed me ta experience
something very hard ta find,
unconditional love that exists
in my body, soul, nd mind.
I dont think u could ever feel
all the love I have to give
nd Im sure ull never realize
uve been my will to live.
u are an amazing person
nd without u I dont know where id be.
Having u in my life
completes and fulfills every part of me.
Uve been the one to make me happy
to complete me, make me whole
nd when i think about wud u take from me
its only my heart that uve stole.
so take it from me
please, baby, take it all
protected it with you life
pick it up when it falls
ill be here when you need me
and kno, ill never leave ur side
and instead of leaving u
id rather Die... but Ryde-
for the one who saved my life
gave it reason, gave it meaning
sitting here, missin ur touch
ur kiss,  ur love,  im feening
tell me im the one
ensure that ull stick ryte by me
and neverleave  my side
promise to make me 'Wifey'
ive always cared for you
ive loved you all the awhile
just gimme the time and date
someday... ill meet you down the aisle.

 I Love you.

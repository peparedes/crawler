I know I haven't updated this thing in forever... Sorry... 
Things are going all right. Feeling much better. Was in the hospital for almost a week. Yuck. I swear, I had no idea how sick I was. I had a cough Monday and my legs were hurting a bit. Tuesday I went to work and lost my job (more on that some other time. Mutual decision between myself and my employer that I needed to seek other employment). By the time my shift was done, I was in a horrible amount of pain through my legs and across my back. I nearly pulled over on the way home to call an ambulance because I didn't think I would make it home. I did make it home, took my temp, and it was over 102 degrees. So, took some Tylenol (which I would later find out was not a good idea) and went to bed. Wednesday, I called the doctor for an appointment and called in sick to work (I was still supposed to work Wednesday and Thursday that week to finish out my job). Luckily, my boss understood. She knew I was feeling bad the day before, and when Mary came in Tuesday, she knew how horrible I was feeling. Well, the doctor said I just had a viral infection in my respiratory system, and I was coughing because I had stuff running down my throat. She said to take Tylenol every four hours, and in between these doses, also take Advil. So, noon Tylenol, 2:00 Advil, 4:00 Tylenol, and so on. Too many pills. She said I should be feeling fine in a day or two. Thursday came and I still felt horrible. Called in to work again. Well, I started throwing up around noon. It didn't stop. By 6pm, I had my mother call to the hospital and see if I should come in, as I was starting to get dehydrated. They said it was my choice if I wanted to. Took my temp again. Over 103 degrees. That clinched it. Went to the emergency room. After the doctor examined me, I could tell something was wrong. He took blood and put me right on an IV. I overheard him talking to the nurses when he got the results. He said ""She's really sick, and she has no idea just how sick she is. We have to admit her."" He was right. Spent the next five days in the hospital. I had pneumonia in my left lung. I also had a ""Super Infection"" (as the doctors call them) which was starting to shut down my organs. My white blood cell count was lower than 3, which means I had this ""super infection"", and my body was losing the fight against. My stomach had already shut down, hence all the throwing up. My liver was shutting down, and my enzyme counts were all over the place. This meant I could not eat or drink ANYTHING. Not even an ice cube. I went for an abdominal ultrasound the first day in, and my spleen was enlarged, showing it was suffering from this infection. 2 days into the stay, the worried that my kidneys had started to shut down as well, but they had recovered quickly. So, lots of IV fluids, hard core antibiotics, and even potassium ivs for the first couple days. 
Anyway, went to the doctor yesterday, and a clean bill of health all around. I'm much better. As i joked with some of my friends, I wasn't quite ready to go just yet. 
Other than that, just hanging out with friends and enjoying time off from working. I'm taking a break from work until August. Just relaxing and having as much fun as I can...
All right, will write more later and explain the whole work situation some other time. 
TTFN"

Not much new in my life. Have started seeing a new guy, Scott. Nice guy. We have a lot of fun together. But we only get to see each other on the weekends. He's trying to work around my schedule to see me though. I'm so busy with work and everything I do, it's hard. But he's willing to get involved in all the aspects of my life. He came with me to poker on Saturday and is going to join the poker night group. He also came with me to the Gamma Chi house on Saturday for an open. He just jumped right in and started getting to know people and hanging out with them. Was nice. Everyone loved him. He really fit right in. And I didn't have him attached to my hip the entire time, which is always a plus:)
work is going as well as can be. As I said, the hotel is boring as usual. Kellys is fun though, even though its work. Last week, I had a blast on my shift. Hope it's as busy again this Friday. 
Been hanging out with the gammas more again. Its been fun getting to know the new pledge class, and some of the new members. I like hanging out there. Makes me kinda feel young still. 
Other than that, not really a lot going on. I received a CD from Dr. B. today with a bunch of frat photos that I now need to go through and get onto the web, but I have at least a day. The web photo album is down right now, so I just need to organize everything tonight to get them uploaded tomorrow. Hopefully the web sight is back up and running tomorrow. Gives me something to do at work:)
Ok, gonna get back to those files. Have a great day!!!!"

My job at the hotel is going well. Slow this time of year, so some of the shifts are really boring. I might sit here for 8 hours and see 2 people the entire time. YAWN!!! My brain usually shuts off by the 4th hour and takes forever to turn back on after I get out of work. Hate that.
My job at the bar is going really well. I like my shift. Work noon to 4 or 8 every Friday. Mostly just the afternoon crowd, who I know pretty well, so I have fun. Always interesting to be on the other side of the bar once in a while. And I'm making some extra cash, which is always good. 
The poker games on Saturdays are good. We're still recruiting new players every once in a while, so it keeps the game interesting. And it's always fun to just hang out with my friends away from the bar. I'll hopefully be able to make this Saturday's game. Weather here has been horrible. 
I was stuck in Geneseo last night until around 5:30am. Jay, Jason, Sebastian and I were hanging out at the bar and suddenly realized that it was snowing like crazy. We decided to go to Sebbie's place and watch a movie until it cleared up a bit. Jason left after the first and called to say the roads were still a bit nasty, so Jay and stayed for another movie. Was finally able to get home, but the roads home still sucked. 
I hate winter here. It stayed so warm this winter that the lakes never froze over, hence a lot of lake effect snow, which always sucks. I cannot wait until I move to a warmer climate. I looked at the weather for Alpine, Texas today. It's 68 degrees there. 68 in the middle of January!!! Why can't New York have that kind of weather?? And people wonder why I want to leave here for there... I packed a bag for tonight so I can stay in town should the weather go horrible again. I don't really like staying at the hotel, but it's better than trying to drive home and then back again in the morning when the roads are all icy and snowy...
I guess that's all there really is. As I said, nothing much happening in my life, so it makes it hard to come up with something to write in here. But, I'll update again as usual when I have something else to talk about.
Until then, TTFN!!"

Had dinner with my family, then got together with friends for a poker game. Afterward hung out at Kevin and Sarah's place with Dave and Jason. Had a lot of fun... too much I think. Jason and I didn't even leave until around 6 in the morning. But, what can you do. Fun is fun, and you gotta have it. 
Birthday is Tuesday. Getting older sucks, but I really don't feel it. Still feel younger than I am, even if Jason keeps picking on me about being an old lady:) All in Jest... Should be a fun day. Having a party at Kelly's and am expecting a bunch of people to be there. Can't wait. 
Anyway, as I said, not much to update, so will write again as soon as I have something to say again :)"

Hell, Dave and I played a round last night from 1:30am until 5:30am. And we have another game this evening with Wise-Ass Jay and whoever else we can get to come... it's been fun hanging out with them outside of the bar. And you can never beat the feeling of winning against a bunch of guys in a game that is supposed to be a ""man"" game. :)

They called again the other day to check up and make sure I have all the information I requested so far. Hopefully will hear soon about whether I'm in or not. Going to Letchworth today with a couple friends. Not sure yet who all is going. Sebastian was the only definite yes. Dave said maybe, same with Shauna and Brandon. Should be a good time. It's nice outside, not too cold. Go up on the trellis and check out the foliage. Letch is always so beautiful this time of year.

Hell, we had a big screen TV and satellite for god's sake. But we had fun. Went fishing the third night we were there. Jay hadn't been catching any fish during the day, so we decided to try at night. Cast out my pole, and had a fish 2 minutes later :) Again cast out, took 3 minutes to get another one. It was funny. Jay was taking the fish off the hook for me, so he'd give me his pole to hold on to. By the time he had the fish off my hook, I was reeling one in on his :) I don't know. Jason and I found it humorous. You might have had to be there...
It was really nice hanging out with Jason as a friend. Good to know we can go out into the middle of no where, God's Country, and not let the fact that we used to be in a relationship come into play in any way. We just hung out and had fun. He did almost throw me in the lake, but he was just kidding. As he pushed me he also grabbed hold of me to make sure I didn't fall in. We had been joking about throwing the other one in for a little while. He just couldn't resist :) Admitted, I shouldn't have been leaning over the dock looking for a fish :) 

Anyway, back at work. Back to the ole same old same old. Really wish I could have stayed a couple more days, but I couldn't get anyone to cover a couple more shifts at work, so I had to come back to responsibility. DAMN IT!!! Just Kidding...

"event","Well, I finished my application for college yesterday. Now I just have to get my transcripts in and then... WAIT!!! I'm really hoping I get in. I'm so excited, it's kinda nutty. Never thought I'd be this excited to go back to school. And especially at my age. But whilst part of me is really excited at such a big change, the other part of my is really nervous at such a big change. By the way, for those of you who don't know yet, the college is Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas. I had hoped for Arizona, but nothing there fits the type of school I want. And Sul Ross fits all my choices. School size: less than 2,500. Town size: up to 25,000 (actually, Alpine is a pretty small town). Has both majors I want, and a Master's degree in both should I decide to stay and get my master's degree there. And the campus is so beautiful. If interested, you can check it out at www.sulross.edu. So, wish me luck!!! I really want this. 

On other fronts, doing well. Looking forward to going camping next weekend. Have to still get some specifics from Jay, but I've got time for that. Will be nice to get out of Geneseo for a few days:)

I'll feel like I'm starting to make improvement, starting to move beyond, and then something sucks me back down and I feel like I'm right at the beginning. Need to get away. Need a vacation. For more than just a couple days. Going camping with Wise-ass Jay for a few days next week. Think it will be really good to get away, even if it is just for a couple days. It's a start. Jay and I get along pretty well. And I think getting back to nature will help. I just need to get my mind off of everything. I really felt like I was making advancements, and then Saturday night, I just fell about as far as I could. It's such a roller coaster. And I know, it's going to take time. And I know, it's going to be hard. And I know, I can do it. And I think I know how I'm going to do it. I know, I'm going to think about him. But the fewer times I think about him, the better. I need to just keep myself busy. Not let my mind roam, analyzing the smallest items. 
I can sit and think about this very logically. But all that logic goes out the door when he's near. And I think I just can't allow him to be near. 
Don't get me wrong. I really do want to be his friend, but at this moment in time, it's just not possible. If I keep going the way I've been going, I won't have him as a friend in the future. I'll completely ruin it. Until I get my head back on straight, I just need to stay away. Sure, I'll say hello to him if I see him, but I have to stop it there. 


Sorry, have rambled quite a bit. It's good to ramble. Let's me get things off my mind instead of analyzing them to little pieces. I guess if you read it all, it must be interesting in some way."

Things are going well. Nothing really big happening, but figured I'd might as well write. People start to think I'm ignoring my journal if I don't write something every so often. Oh well.

Jason and I are doing well. He made a comment last night that he's not finished trying to make up to me the whole break up, even if it was just for a week. I had thought he'd already done the things he was planning to do as make up. Apparently he has more he wants to do to show me how much he loves me. Awww:) 

Hung out with my friend Franco from Alfred. Was a little weird having him and my Geneseo friends in the same place. Had fun though. Is always good to see one of the Committee members.

Work has really been horrible. Last week, everything that could go wrong did. This week is at least a bit better. We're still booked, but the big company group has come in. They'll be in the hotel for over 2 months. Makes the rest of the summer a little less busy for all of us at work. Hopefully things go better for the remainder of the summer.

He has issues he needs to work out, and whilst I will stand beside him as a friend while he works these things out, I cannot be his girlfriend during it. It's not fair to either of us to keep this relationship going. I'm waiting to see how it turns out. I do hope he can work this out, because he is a great guy, and I do like him a lot. I'll keep you all updated.
Other than that, I'm back to work, which I feel like I may hate even more now that I got away for a week. Need to figure some stuff out. May go back to school finally and get a degree, but not in psychology, in business. I'm good at it. Who would've thunk:) I just have to make the decision and get cracking on checking out schools and such. Wouldn't be until the spring semester as I don't have time to get in before that, but I'm really considering it.

Didn't really do anything. Just hung out with friends and Jason and tried to relax. I have to go back to work tomorrow, and I don't want to yet, but I guess it's a good thing. Get back into my schedule and get my mind off of these thoughts that have gone through it for the last week. I don't know if I'm wondering about the status of my relationship because there is an actual problem, like it feels, or because I had a thought about something and now can't shake the other thoughts that are going along with it, due to the fact that I've had so much time on my hands this week. I guess we shall see when I go back to work tomorrow. If I still have these thoughts in another week, I'll need to figure out whats going on, or more precisely, what isn't. I don't know. I want to talk to friends about it, but find myself holding back. I think I need to get this one figured out on my own. 
Other than that, not much to talk about. Sharon and Billy's wedding is this Saturday, which I'm looking forward to. Should be a good day.

Saw Troy, which is a serious babe fest. Nothing like really cute guys running around in short little outfits:) Also saw Kill Bill Vol.2 which was pretty good. We were a bit worried that we wouldn't understand part of it since none of us had seen Vol. 1, but none of us were confused at all. 

On my positive front, things are really good. Jason and I are still together and getting along great. Will hopefully be seeing him tonight. His work has been hard this week, and he's tired, but he said he'd try his hardest to be out.

On my positive front, things are good. Jason and I are still together and doing well. I'm glad I'm in this relationship. It's just so laid back and casual, we haven't had to deal with any problems yet. Can't really imagine having any problems with him. I think I may have finally found a lasting relationship... (mush mush mush)... 
Been hanging out with Sarah and Tom a lot lately. I love spending time with them. They are both probably my best friends in a long time. They'll never really know how much I love them, but as long as they get a basic idea, that's all that matters. 
The college kiddies finally went home, or most of them. Bout damn time!!! I like it here during the school year, but not as much as the summer time. It's just alot more easy going here in the summer. You can hang out at the bar, take your drink out back and relax with your friends. Just much more fun for me in the summer.
Anyway, I have to get back to work, but I promise I will try a little harder to keep this updated.

It's alumni weekend this weekend, which means I won't be entering any of the bars willingly, including my own. Too crowded and the people are so rude. I hate this weekend. But the countdown is now in effect for graduation when all the little college kiddies go home for the summer, and we townies take our bar back. I can't wait!!!

Other than that, nothing really big to update on. Hope everyone is doing good!!!"

"event","So the alumni are starting to pour into our little town. Jen and Robyn are both here already, lots more coming in tomorrow. I love this time of year. All the old friends gathering at a little field to party for one day before we all go back to our lovely lives for another year. Okay, so maybe we don't party for just one day. With two days of pregaming and usually another party Sunday to finish the kegs, it's 4 days, but hey, who cares about semantics...

Anyway, I shall write on Monday and let everyone know how it went..."

"event","When I started this journal, I told myself that I was going to try to write in it everyday. Oops. I think I failed. But it's not totally my fault. I have been busy, both at work and at play. Work is starting to get alot busier. It's definitely not the winter season anymore. Now if only the weather here would realize that as well. When I got home last night, there were 2 inches of snow on the ground that had fallen over the few hours I was in Geneseo. Ridiculous!!! It's April, right? Doesn't that mean warm weather again? Maybe it's just me, but I need sunshine!!! 

On my positive front, things are still going well with Jason and I. He went with me to Easter dinner at my grandparents house and met most of the family. He handled it really well. I would have been scared out of my mind, but he really didn't seem to mind. In fact, I think I was more nervous than he was. But he did comment when we left that he really needed a drink. Of course, so did I, so we went over to Sarah and Tom's place and hung out with them and Travis for the rest of the evening. It was a good day over all. 
Went to Sarah and Tom's place again last night. We just stayed in for most of the night and watched a couple movies. It was technically Ladies Day, but as Tom was hanging out with us as well, we behaved ourselves and tried to censor parts of our normal conversations. And no tequila was involved, which was good. But next week, as long as it's nice outside, we're doing Margarita Monday. Yeah!!!! Always alot of fun! 

Anyway, gotta get back to trying to do some work. Hopefully I'll have some time to write in this again tomorrow or Thursday before I get busy at work. Who knows."

"event","I had the weirdest dream last night. Well, this morning actually, but who cares about semantics when you have dreams like this one:

There was a large group of us traveling like a group of gypsies across some foreign landscape. We had flags that identified us by our different ""tribes"" or groups. Now, Sarah, Tom, Jason, Travis and myself were all in the same tribe. We finally end our trip at this huge wooden lodge where we go inside. 

Come to find out, we're all actually slaves travelling to a slave auction of sorts. There are all these rich couples standing around looking each of the groups over and each of us individuals over. The rich people were dressed in Elizabethan clothing, so it had to be in the past, most likely in Europe. Anyway...

Sarah, Tom, Jason and myself are all picked by the same couple. Now, they seem like a really nice couple, and the woman hugs both Sarah and I to show her kindness. Well, we're really lucky to be picked because if you aren't picked by someone, you will have no place to live, and you will starve and die. 

Now, this concerns me, because Travis has not been picked. And it doesn't look like he is going to be picked by anyone. So, taking advantage of the kindness of the woman who has picked us, I decide to try and get her to pick Travis. 

Suddenly here, I am not able to speak. My mouth won't even open. 

So I look at the woman and make as much noise as I could pointing in Travis' direction, trying to get the woman to understand that she should also pick Travis. The lady looks at me with kindness, and tells me to go get him, that he'll come with us. 

Suddenly, again I can speak. 

So I run into the kitchen (no idea why Travis suddenly is in the kitchen) and tell Travis that the woman has picked him also to come with us. 

At this moment, Travis pitches a fit because he doesn't want to be a slave and he thinks that by convincing the woman to pick him, I have condemned him to be a slave. I try to reason with him that he is already a slave, and that I have actually saved his life. Otherwise he would starve to death. While I'm speaking, the other 3 show up in the kitchen to help me get him, because our new owners want to head out.

As I'm trying to tell him this, his head suddenly falls off and is gone. This doesn't stop Travis from yelling. From his neck, he keeps yelling, not just at me but at all of us. 

Now, seeing his head suddenly fall off and disappear, we all start laughing. He yells that we are always picking on him about something. We're always laughing at him over something he's done. He keeps yelling that his head falling off is serious, and that it's nothing to laugh about. This just makes us laugh even more at him because he's yelling at us about losing his head.

Right at that moment, my alarm clock went off and woke me up.

Such interesting dreams. Try interpreting that one...

Side note: With as hard as we were laughing at Travis for losing his head, had the dream kept going on, I think we would have laugh our heads off :)"

"event","Well, I'm at work right now. This entry may take a little while to write as I'm busy here tonight. As soon as I try doing anything, including eating, more customers walk through the door. What can you do? I'd rather have it busy than slow. Makes the time go by a bit faster. And anything that makes work go by is good. 
On my positive front, Jason and I went to Sarah's place last night and watched a movie with her and Tom. It was called Disembodied or something like that. It is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's one of those movies where it's soooo bad you laugh through most of it. We had fun. I really enjoy spending time with Tom and Sarah when Jason and I are out. I think it's the couple thing. Good to have another couple to hang out with, and I love both Sarah and Tom so much. More than either probably will ever know. But as long as they know I care, that's what counts. And Jason is such a great guy. He does all the little things that women enjoy. He'll help me with my jacket, hold the door open for me, light my cigarette, things like that. And I've always appreciated the little things more than the big, grand gestures. A big gesture is nice, don't get me wrong, but the little things show that the person is thinking about you most of the time. That's always a good feeling.  
Well, I'm gonna get back to work here as the customers are still coming in."

"event","Have I mentioned yet today that I hate work? Guess it really isn't that bad, I just really don't want to be here right now. Of course, I usually don't want to be here. Some of the busier days I don't mind it, but it's going to be another really slow day today, and I'm tired already. I'll be exhausted by the time I get out of here tonight...
On my positive front, I had a good night last night. Jason came over to my place and we watched a couple movies. Pretty much just enjoyed the other's company. Watched The Dark Crystal, which almost put both of us to sleep. Had to watch Pirates of the Caribbean to wake up a little after that. But it was nice to just spend time with him for the evening. 
Have a Gamma Chi Party on Saturday that I'm going to try my hardest to attend. I haven't been to one in a while, and am missing some of the members. Fly Day is soon also. Can't wait to see all the alumni coming in to the hotel. I hate that we only see each other once a year!! But that one day is great. I can't wait!!!
Anyway, it's a short entry, but at least I'm keeping this updated!!!"

"event","It is such a gorgeous day outside. Why can't it stay this way? Oh yeah, I live in New York, that's why!!! But anyway...
Since it is such a nice day outside, I've decided to spend the day outdoors instead of in. And I've invited a couple friends over to my place to hang out in the backyard. We were thinking of going to Letchworth, but as I live in the middle of the country, and Letchworth doesn't allow alcohol, I think we're just going to hang out here and enjoy the weather with some beer. Now if I could just get ahold of one of them!!! You know who you are :) 
Everyone please enjoy the day..."

"event","Okay. I don't know why this bothers me so much but it does. One of my customers has been sitting down here in the lobby for about five hours. If he were just watching the television and being quiet, I wouldn't mind so much. But he keeps getting up about every 10 minutes and walks around the lobby a few times before sitting back down again. Add to that the fact that when he's sitting down he's kicking the bottom of the table making noise. It's so annoying. 
Okay, while writing this, he has gone back upstairs to his room. I really hope he stays there!! 
Going to go back to watching Notting Hill. I love this movie."

"event","As more and more time went by, I found I simply could not refuse to use this journal. Hey, might as well try it. I haven't kept a real journal in so long, it might be nice to keep my memories in a certain place again. 

On my positive front, things with Jason and I are going very well. It's weird. I've always thought of my life as a good life. I thought I was happy with being single. I work a lot, free time is precious (and I'm very selfish about my free time), and I could not see giving up any of my time for someone else to take. It's my time, I earned it, let me have it!!! And it's been a long time since I've dated anyone. So, I was happy in my little world. 
Just about the time you truly believe you are happy being alone and don't want to date anyone, cupid comes along and doesn't just shoot you with an arrow, but knocks you upside the head with a 2 x 4. And you suddenly realize you weren't happy really. I was mearly content with my life. 
Now being content is not a bad thing. For me, it's a great thing. It took a lot for me to be content with things. But being content is NOT being happy. And being happy is a very nice feeling. For the first week and a half, my cheeks actually ached from smiling so much. All my friends and acquaintances notice a change. I never really realized how often I didn't smile until my smiling became an issue of amusement for others. And I will admit, with some difficulty, that smiling does feel good. I've missed it. I've missed having someone in my life that, just by looking at me, causes me to smile and (dare I say it) laugh. 
Admitted, we only made the relationship official about a week ago, but I'm already hooked. I can't wait to get out of work every day to go see him and spend time with him. He calls me during the day just to say hi, and at night just to say goodbye. I know, mush mush mush...
I'll stop.

Had a good night with Sarah last night. Jason and I spent time with her at her place instead of the bar. It's nice to get out of the bar, especially on the weekends when it's so crowded in there you can't breath. We just hung out at her apartment and watched Stigmata. Good movie. Hadn't seen it before, and I'm glad I did. Then we popped down to the bar to say hi to Tom and Aubrie and everyone. 
I love my friends so dearly. More than most of them will ever know. I try to let them see it as often as possible, and if they do, I'm even more happy. Some I've had spats with in the past, but the friendship is always stronger on the other side. And I wouldn't change the past for all the world. Things need to be said. Friendships need to be challenged. If they're worth it, they'll work out. 

All right. I should probably get back to pretending to work today. As it's a Sunday, we aren't really all that busy today. But what customers I do have like to see me working instead of typing on my computer. Damn customers!!"

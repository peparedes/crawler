"event","So in college I had these two twenty-five cent goldfish.  I kept them alive for over two years before they finally bit it.  They were my most darling friends!

So it all began on Winter Break 2000.  I realized that having grown-up practically underwater and surrounded on all sides by aquariums of various shape, size, and inhabitants that i needed some finned friends to keep me sane.  So i headed down with my meager budget to the Village Pet Shoppe and bought myself a bowl, some water conditioner, some colorful glass marbley rocks, a ridiculously silly plastic plant, goldfish pellet food, a air pump to oxygenate their water, and 3 darling feeder fish...and I was OFF.  

I realized pretty early on that the big white one was a viscous son-of-a-fish.  He kept picking on the other two, smaller gold ones and I didn't one bit appreciate it.  The others had some strange black markings.  I stared and stared at the one trying to place what that strange moustache-looking mark above it's silly mouth was.  Then it came to me, Hitler.  He practically named himself.  Naturally, the big white was Stalin leaving the third, spotty (birthmarked?) guy, as Mussolini.

My boyfriend at the time was deeply offended by these culturally insensitive names and after much discourse they became the unnamed fish and mean Stalin went back to the Village Pet Shoppe.  I got a weird look from the guy when I tried to return a $.25 goldfish and didn't ask for a refund, stating that he had a ""disagreeable disposition"".  I'm pretty sure he thought I was crazy.  He might have been/be right about that.

For about 4 months my little darlings went nameless and in that time (due to proper nutrition) Hitler shaved his moustache and Mussolini had laser therapy.  Thier perfectly orange little bodies glinted in the sunlight as they happily frolicked in their bowl.  It wasn't until just after Spring break that they finally became real pets with real names.

Upon returning from Michigan with Kimba I realized that in my exam-consumed frenzy prior to my trip I had forgotten to drop in their feeder pyramid and they were on the brink of starvation.  As quickly as I could I threw in as much food as they could eat.  Now, if you don't know this, these goldfish food pellets expand in water....or in a fish's belly as was the case.  So these little guys were going CRAZY eating all these pellets.  So crazy that their tiny bellies became engorged and the pellets were backing up all the way out their throat to the point that they couldn't consume anymore.  I was, of course, frantically trying to fish out the excess as Kim watched on nearly peeing herself with laughter.  Then then all of a sudden one of them spit out 6 pellets right in a row.  It looked like Mario or Luigi spitting fireballs.  But then he just went right on re-eating the same pellets he'd just evacuated.  The the other one did it, and on and on again.  So, they became Binge & Purge.  An not-quite-as-equally insensitve name but culturally insensitive just the same.

I loved my litte Binge & Purge all the way up until they met their demise on a cold Spring Cleaning day when their little bowl became polluted with cleaning products.  Fortunately, Ricker was nearby to help me ""bury"" them.

RIP my little angels...

Moving on to the present.... I bought an aquarium about a year and a half ago and just finally, FINALLY filled it last night.  I picked out two lovely red-capped orandas (my favorite breed), the goldfish with the brain-looking thingys on their heads.  So now I'm trying to come up with names for them since I don't think they are going to name themselves this time.  Here are the options so far....

The Dread Pirate & Buttercup the 2nd (since Adam murdered Buttercup the 1st at the young age of 3.  He claims he ""was jus' trying to hug da fissee!""  Likely story.)
Count Poopsalot & Hotlips Houlihan (from my favorite childhood TV show, MASH)
Frijole &  Ace
Anchovy & Fraulein Chowder
Sashimi & Wasabi Snooter (as in from the Jackass movie)
Jezebel & Hot Carl (a hot carl is when someone poops on your face in bed...some ppl might find this sexy)
Barnacle & Davy Jones

I'm leaning towards Anchovy & Fraulein Chowder at the mo....
Thoughts?

"event","last friday night came close to the funniest night of my life.  it all began at 4pm at harrington's with some coworkers.  three beers and a lemon drop (agains my will) later i caught the 21 home where i had to haul ass to get ready & get to betelnut to meet steph, eric, mel and mel's two friends up from la.  last time mel and i hung out (in la) we were getting dollars stuffed in our pants while singing/stripping to ""i touch myself"".  so i knew it would be a fun night but i really didn't anticipate what was in store.  her friends that she brought up with her are a riot.  riot!  after a giant meal, in which over half of the sum of our bill was for alcohol, we wandered down the street to U Street.  i'm not one for hanging out in the marina but i'm also a big believer that if you are in good company, it won't matter where you are, you'll still have fun.  so i don't judge, i hang out in north beach with the b&t sometimes and the only time i've hated it has been when i was with bar-snobs.  back to U Street.  first of all the DJ is H-O-T, smoking hot.  not even just a little bit.  

see photo of me staring longingly...isn't it just so pathetical-losery awesome!!!  god i'm hopeless...

all i wanted to do was make out with his face.  but i don't talk to guys in bars.  especially not ones who are like 10 times hotter than me and way out of my league.  so melissa and amira begin concocting ways to make me talk to him since they see that i'm never going to do anything but stare at him with pathetic lust in my eyes.  this is why i am so hopeless at dating.  i find out his name is christian, he lives in the haight, he's an engineer by day, and that (here's where my heart broke into a million little pieces) he doesn't like going to shows because he prefers the remixed songs of the bands to the original versions.  so much for that.  i sort of wished i believed in missed connections but i really don't think people should get a second chance if they are too much of a wuus (like me) to actually make a move when they have the opportunity.  goodbye christian, i will have to content myself with the fantasy of a world in which you actually liked live music made my musicians with actual musical instruments to remixes made my chubby guys with machines.  okay, i'm sorry...i'm sure they're not all chubby.  i don't even know why i'd say that."

ON MY OWN TERMS. i want to do, what i want to do and i'm sick and tired of people trying to tell me there is a prescribed way to god-damned live my life, and what protocol i should follow to be happy. so yeah, sometimes i get the feeling that i'll never be happy again. not in the way i <em>was</em> always and <em>am</em> always told i <em>should</em> be happy. but you know what, i'm not listening to any of it anymore. i can do it by myself and i don't need anymore ""help"" following the rules."

"event","I worked out so much this weekend, I am feeling fit as a drowsy fiddle today!  It's hard to be this disciplined for most people, but not for me.  I don't know anyone who trains as much as I do...except for Jeff, but he's in a marathon-sleeper category all his own.  In fact, I'm up to 11 hours at a stretch, which doesn't quite beat my 18-hour record from freshman year of college but is showing promising progress.  

You might wonder what sort of equipment I use to make me so successful...well, I'll tell you.  I started with a firm pillow-top mattress and I can't stress this enough...it is worth the investment.  You can find good deals on mattresses on long holiday weekends like labor day and 4th of july.  I got mine for 1/2 off and it was well worth it.  The next step is to obtain the right sheets.  Now everyone has varying preferences as to what is most comfortable.  I prefer cotton sateen sheets in a high threadcount and again, they are worth the investment.  Next...Pillows, pillows, pillows.  Good neck support is essential.  The minute you become uncomfortable is the minute your marathon ends.  Plus, if you tweak it, you will be suffering miserably the next day.  Spend some time at the pillow store really testing them out.  Who cares if you get funny looks while laying in the middle of the aisle taking power naps on all the various choices...what matters is that you choose the RIGHT pillow or you'll never make it in this discipline.  As far as blankets are concerned, the important part is to not be too cold nor too warm...but to achieve a temperature that is juuuust right.  This will take practice and use of the ""guess and test"" method to determine the correct conditions.  Keep in mind that you can only control these conditions to a certain extent, your training will become dependent on outside conditions, how you allow them to affect you, and how you adapt to modify your ability to exercise longer.  

So, as we can see, the aspect of environment can not be over looked.  Let's start with lighting.  This can not be stressed enough, black-out window coverings are essential.  Let's talk neurology for a minute...if you are exposed to light, a photic-type zeitgeber, it will signal your brain to produce chemicals that will begin to wake you up.  (I'm not making this up.)  Zeitgebers work to set your circadian rhythm and should be avoided at all costs during any training of this type.  They are perilous for the person who intends to achieve the optimal results and the maximum possible amount of time spend in slumber.  The other highly essential environmental factor to be considered is room temperature.  This can be controlled in a number of ways...blankets, outside air (i.e. open a window), or a heat source.  When you've spent as many years training in this discipline as I have this becomes a simple challenge to manage but for the novice it can be quite daunting.  Don't lose heart, though.  Each time you are awakened by the uncomfortability of the room's temperature simply tweak it a bit using one of the aforementioned temperature altering devices and try to go back to sleep.  Crack the window, add a blanket, turn on the heater...don't make it too hard!  I think it goes without saying that noise will wake you up.  If you can't get around noisy circumstances, invest in earplugs.  That is how I won the battle with my stomps-a-lot roommates upstairs.

I hope that as the champion sleeper that I have become, I have been able to impart to you some of my wisdom.  I am on the lookout for good work-out partners so if you think you can keep up, give me a call."

- led pointers are addictive to idiots
- my cousin has a 5 hairs growing out of her facial mole
- yogi dog is much much bigger than me and has a bizzare fascination with nibbling feet...does he think he's a person?
- not to look at gin in any way, lest be discovered due to excessive meaningless random laughing fits
- a benefit of marijuana use: pizza is actually tolerable and what do you know, so is the madness!
- the sound most people call *silence* is actually the noise a mountain lion makes just before it attacks (okay, that was hacked from toothpastefordinner but i was really scared when we snuck up the hill to smoke! and i can't stop repeating it.)
- no one listens and retains more than 4 words of a sentence that someone else said, they just go off on some other tanget...it's really effing annoying

"event","sooo not in to the holidays this year.  i don't feel like buying gifts for people who have the ability to buy whatever they need/want.  i don't feel like receiving gifts that, while thoughtful, i don't need nor do i necessarily want.  the ravenous consumerism makes me so sad.  i feel like this holiday is devoid of meaning.  i am finding it contrived.  i don't think that is a reflection of the nature of the holiday itself, i think it is a result of my own shifting sense of meaning.  what christmas once meant to me is now a farce and i feel it has now become vacuous and devoid of emotion.  i suppose the solution is to recreate a more personally meaningful understanding of the celebration as the adult that i am...  one can not remain settled in a childhood conception of life and celebration if one wants to evolve, but one can still maintain the childlike wonder, right?  

anyone else encountered this sort of transition?  if so, pls share your insight...i'm sick of being the only one disgusted by hearing Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer sung 40,000 different ways playing in every shop i go into."

We are terrified to look inward, because our culture has given us no idea what to find. We may even think that if we meditate, we will be in danger of madness. This is one of the last resouceful ploys of the ego. To prevent us from discovering our real nature.

And I talked to God, and she says, ""Yo, wassup?"" and she wants you to lose the gun...It's the wood that should fear your hand, not the other way around. No wonder you can't do it, you acquiesce to defeat before you even begin...Who's to say that love needs to be soft and gentle?...Torture you? That's a good idea. I like that...I am an F - B - I agent!!!...why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?  why are you wearing that stupid man suit?...Has it ever occurred to you that maybe you're not too big? Maybe this place is just too small?...now go away before I taunt you a SECOND time...wipe that face off your head, bitch!...Look at it out here, it's all falling apart. I'm erasing you and I'm happy!...I'll tell you everything, and you tell me everything, and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people...

(this just SCREAMS: I'm more clever than you!  Figure out what movies these quotes are from THEN maybe you'll know what I like.  it's all just a game, really.)

"event","3rd to go....Interests: usui reiki, newcastle and other nutty Brit ales, attempting to prevent myself from spending my entire disposable income on rock shows and booze, buddhism, indepenent film and music, cubbies baseball, camping, feng shui, pirates, ramen and takoyaki, people watching, blueberry toaster waffles, yoga, social consciousness, psychometry

(honestly, most of this stuff is just here to make me seem as interesting as possibly.  it isn't REALLY completely honest.  it isn't 100% TRUE.  pirates?!?!  c'mon...no one believes that i have a legit INTEREST in pirates!  if they do, they are seriously stupid.  i do NOT study the history and culture of pirates, but i DO like the concept.  that, however, does not make it an INTEREST.  example one to reinforce the point that EVERYONE -including me- LIES on myspace to make themselves seem more interesting to anonymous people who are checking them out.)

4th to go.....TV: Who really gives a shit about TV anyway?  All it ever is anymore is desperate attempts to shock viewers with a ""reality"" far juicier than their own pathetic lives offer.  Gimme a fucking break.  You want riveting reality television???  Watch the NEWS for chissakes!!  Something relevant and far more (ahem) REALISTIC.  Okay, okay, okay...I totally watched part of 'So You Think You Can Dance' last night.   I know, I am ashamed...but that Allan is MESMERIZING.

(okay, so here....i actually said something relevant and important that expressed how i really feel about television.  it is abrasive and probably alienated some people but it was AUTHENTIC.  so why, then, did i need to go nice-it-up with the last part???  to temper the abrasive nature and create a sense that people can relate to me??  who gives a shit, i don't KNOW most of these people who are looking at my profile!!  and why nullify my point about television?  compromising yourself to appeal to a larger body of people, marketing oneself, THAT is what myspace is about.)

5th to go.....who i'd like to meet: People who posses muni passes, library cards, strong convictions and some shred of integrity

(this is is a good attempt to be authentic.  the truth is however, i don't REALLY want to meet ANYONE on myspace.  all this really is is another attempt to attract admiration from a throng of anonymous observers and collect self-assuring admiration from people i don't know and a few that i do who SHOULD ALREADY KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT WITHOUT myspace.)

I am very shy and avoid contact with people as much as possible.  Some might call me a recluse or socially inept.

"event","I am suffering from a lesser-known version of Obsessive Complusive Disorder, DCD....Dean Compulsive Disorder.  

This psychological ailment is characterized by an unexplainable inability to resist him in all his many forms, good and bad.  Accompanied by a serious state of self-deception and total inability to act on self-aware realizations that it MAY not be best for the two to become romantically involved again.  Furthermore, suffers of this disease* are often struck, in the more advanced phases of the disease, by the feeling that while they are not totally convinced they should be with Dean, they are impotent to watch him be with anyone else.  Moreover, the disease typically first takes hold within minutes, gripping the diseased person for at least months but usually years to come.  Fantasies of an eternity spent in union and long blissful days trifled away unendingly in his adoring gaze are common delusions suffered by the DCD person, especially in its nascency.  This all-consuming illness never really relinquishes control of its psychological captive unless extreme and forceful measures are put in to place.  Even when said forceful measures have been taken and seem to have been effective, the diseased person is never too far from falling off the wagon upon encountering Dean even in the most innocent of settings with the clearest and most innocent of intentions.  Extreme caution should be taken in all dealings with Dean and sufferers would be well advised to avoid conversation, interaction, and especially eye-contact with him, especially if attempting to overcome DCD.  

Finally, all others coming in to contact with the primary and most feverishly involved of the current crop of DCD sufferers should proceed with wariness.  She has been known to be a fierce and relentless bitch, decimating all in her path to that which is consuming her mind.  This is the most violent and disturbing characteristic of the disease.  Use extreme caution, she may appear pleasant but I assure you, such is not the case and said persons have been know to exhibit vile Jekyl & Hyde-like behaviors.

As soon as my prognosis discovers a certain cure for out how to beat the hell out of this mysterious addiction, I will be starting a support group.  If you are a recovered DCD sufferer and would like to take the first steps in that direction, I would be very grateful for your contribution to humanity.  All donations for reseach into this baffling and crippling disease are gratefully welcomed and will not be spent on alcohol or fun accessories as per my other addictions.  ;)

*and we are many, some have recovered by choice or because they were left without the choice"

pb's roof deck
let the mental fireworks begin!
Here's a few gems from the first ever Scrabble Showdown....

While the spelling of Q-U-E-E-F is still in debate, for future games Q-U-E-E-F will be allowed and Q-U-I-E-F will not, while queef jerky is two words and (just like status quo) can not be placed for points on the board on one's turn. (thank you, Dave for clarifying this spelling question...)

F-E-L-L-A-T-O-R, as in one who fellates or performs fellatio is included in the Official Scrabble Dictionary and will be allowed.

Y-I-M-I-A-U...the mythical giant feline named for it's strangely enchanting mating call, a fierce predator yet a tender lover, will not be allowed as a word on the board.

G-R-I-D-D-L-E-S, is not spelled with a Mc at the front.

No extra points will be awarded for using female genitalia (in the game, of course), though V-U-L-V-A was an especially good play, Jay.

Clearing your queue to spell A-S-T-O-U-N-D would be a lot more gratifying if you don't do it in such a way that allows some hack to come along and add an S to the end on the 'triple word score square' to form a new word, ultimately raking in 87 points and kicking your ass by 2 points. (196 to 194...it's so O-N Dave!!)

Next Showdown...
So it is set then....I will host this time and supply the snacks....you all supply the beers and/or booze (bring whatever you want to drink or share). :)

So it seems we have 7 committed players with the jury still out on Jay. Feel free to invite spectators but make sure they know that aiding and abetting a cheater will result in swift eviction from the playing area and loss of beer bitch privilages.

Let's take the two top scorers from each board to play each other for bragging rights. 

Let the competition B-E-G-I-N!!!"

"event","Dean just said he wants to buy me a baby penguin for Christmas.  (no, this is not a euphemism) I am going to name her Argentina Blasphemous Scheidey.  Her initals will be ABS and I will have them monogrammed on all of her penguin-sized american apparel hoodies.  She is going to live in my new jacuzzi bathtub and I will keep it full of ice made exclusively from fiji water.  (In case you were wondering, that is severe love, giving up your jacuzzi tub for another.  I'm pretty sure God just forgot to include that in the bible.)  Furthermore, I plan to feed her fresh honmaguro sashimi (that is fatty tuna for you lay-people) and REAL wakame (not that gelatinous shit they serve in the US) every day. Does anyone know what penguin excrement is like??  I need to plan for the potty training.  I suppose penguin play groups might be somewhat hard to find and I'm pretty sure there aren't any penguin parks around here.  I guess that she will just be a strangely socialialized animal, more comfortable around humans than her own kind.  I'm going to take my li'l waddle-tastic Argey everywhere with me...she is going to be my best friend."

"event","I need help with my Halloween disguise!  As in, I am extraordinarily bad at this and I need ideas, and how.  Let me paint a painful picture for you... so this one year I was a ""rubber ducky"".  No, it's embarassing, I know.  It wasn't even CLOSE to as cool as it sounds like it might have been had I pulled it off.  Whatever, swim goggles are super rad as a costume component, you don't even know!  Not to mention it was a TOTALLY long time ago, and last minute with strep throat, I'm so sure!  (ahem, 2003) I'm ashamed...let's not talk about it anymore.  But you get the point, right?  I need serious help.  Here's some hint for you while considering my plight:  


(ONE)  I'm not that in to the slutty stuff so if any of your suggestions begin with the word ""sexy"" or end with the phrase ""so that way every guy will totally respect you...for your awesome cleavage"" or ""you'll give SO many guys boners"" I probably won't be that enthralled.

(TWO)  Remember, I'm only 5'2""...that is small yet not midget-sized, cute but not necessarily nice, petite yet dangerous...SO NO SHORT JOKES, a'ight!  There is just no way I am going to be an elf, an oompa-loompa, strawberry SHORTcake, that dwarf from the Amazing Race who is on Celebrity Poker all of a sudden (wait, why are you famous, again, Charla?  are you related to Paris Hilton?  If you are I'd like to see that homemade sex video.  wait...what?), or any other vertically challenged character from life, film, cartoon, or fantasy.  I'm just not, so get over it...and NO it would not be kinda funny.

(THREE) No more couple-costumes.  That shit is lay-haaame and I there is no way I can take Mx telling me she hates me for being 1/2 of such a cute costumed-couple 10,000 times this year.  And yes, Margaux, I KNOW...""Halloween isn't for brown people"", I get it.  ;)

(FOUR)  Occupations are not costumes.  That's it.  I'm not 7 years old anymore, most of the time, and I'm sure as shit not a ballerina.  When I was 7, maybe I thought I wanted to BE a ballerina someday.  Now I just want to be a trophy-wife....but, sadly, that does not make for a very good costume.  Occupations are not costumes, I'll say it again...for emphasis.

(FIVE)  I am effectively a pretty lazy person when it comes to this stuff (okay, lots of other stuff too) so let's keep the effort factor to a minimum, huh.

(SIX)   If you send me a good idea, I'll totally advertise you or your cause...but not on my tits or ass so don't even ask.

I'm looking forward to this...my idea-weather-meter is predicting ""BRAINSTORM""!!!  (har har har)"

"event","<FONT color=#990000>Unprotected sun exposure is just not worth it, kids. I know we've all heard it before at least one or two THOUSAND times but I really can't say it enough. Listen, if you are going to be outdoors for 15 minutes to, oh I don't know...say 8 hours at Bay to Breakers, it is a GOOD idea to slather some SPF 45 on. Oh, believe me...I know how great it is that ONE day in between when you burned yourself to that cancerous crisp and when your face starts to fall off in chunks...SO TAN looking!! So hot. But let's just be honest....you just look like a big giant FREAK once the peeling begins. I know, I AM the freak...I'm the freak on the bus whose skin cracks open like a parched desert oasis when she smiles at you...the freak at the office whose skin is floating into your coffee cup as you check your outlook calendar...the freak in line at the local lunch spot who leaves an outline of skin on the ground around herself as she waits in line to order her udon noodles. For the love of epidermis....DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!! Use your SPF, love your SPF, become your SPF. Melanoma kills, kids. Remember that.</FONT>"

"event","So how am I really??? Overall pretty great considering how much crap I've been putting myself through to get healthy and vital and stable in every area of my life. I call it my quest for Sustainable Vitality.  So the theory is that if I have a Sustainable Vitality (yes, I made the concept/phrase up myself) in every area of my life (career/vocation, spiritual, emotional, physical, mental, social, etc.) then I avoid the excessive peaks and crashes that have kept my energy at a low level. This lack of energy has disabled me from really living a healthy life (translation: dealing with my shit) and thriving and also from giving to others in a healthy and unconditional manner. So how that has taken shape, practically speaking, is the obvious ones like sending Dean packing (NOT an easy task) and changing jobs repeatedly before finding one that allows me to do pursue my other interests outside of work. The other ways is has manifested has been in my time management and activities...just going through everything and really evaluating my time and activities from the standpoint of how each contributes to or drains my overall energy level (i.e. my ability to do work and stay healthy...right) and then modifying my lifestyle to enhance the energizing ones and decrease the energy draining ones.  It has been challenging but very rewarding. It is all a major process I am in and some days are the fucking tops and some days are hell but I am becoming more consistently up and even everyday and more healthy and more vital. So in summary...I am happier and healthier than ever."

"event","Things like jealous homicide and that phrase about a woman scorned... The vindictive bitch that lives somewhere deep inside me and every woman has been rearing her ugly ugly hysterically evil head and I am sorry to say it but I fucking like her style! So many amazingly creative and venemous life-ruining plots have been hashed in my wicked little brain and to be honest the only thing that has saved that lying-sack-of-shit from her wrath has been yoga, deep breathing and a deep belief in the reciprocal law of karma. It is the rage at finding out that the protracted, lengthy, and (let's just be honest) mostly unsatisfying relationship that I sacrificed my precious time, energy, and money for was ultimately all based on idiotic lies and that the child I was with actually killed his soul with ethanol long before I ever even met him but has not yet managed to alter his angelic face with that same weapon of addiction. I'm so glad I've been able to connect with that wicked evil powerful side of myself and realize just how much power I have but most importantly how much self-control and discipline I have. It is true that hell hath no fury but ultimately I'd only be hurting myself and he isn't worth it."

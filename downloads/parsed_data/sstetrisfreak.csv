"event","Just when you think that you are letting yourself slip away God strengthens you and lifts you up. How can we help others believe in God? It seems like people are scared to know God in a personal way. Maybe because they know that when they come to know Him they will truly see how unworthy they are of God's love.
Maybe then they will feel like they should change their ways, and that can be very scary."

But why do i still feel the longings for someone?Someone to spend the rest of my life with. I am happy with my life but my heart still aches for a love that might not even exist, a romantic love that ive only dreamt of. Gods love is the greatest love and i truly know and feel that, Hes the one that fills me to the core with peace and love and every great emotion ive ever experienced.So how can i feel so complete and yet still incomplete?"

"event","Brothers and sisters happy Good Friday! Good Friday is one of the very best celebrations in the entire year! Because Jesus sacrificed himself for us, we can live in peace and in joy. Jesus Christ...my everything. It was almost impossible to feel loneliness and sadness today because of thinking about how much love God has for me. Uhhh...how great. Give thanks to the Lord, and remember the true meaning of Easter. He rose! He is the messiah! Why do people make Easter about bunnies, colored eggs, and choclates?!"

                                                         - James 4:14

Tomorrow isnt promised to us, life is really short.
Now is the time to save lives , now is the time to witness and feed the starving children. When will we 
give everything away and follow Christ? When will we love like Jesus told us to? When? Will we loose our lives to save them? When will we choose others well beings rather than our own? When will we stop the selfishness and realize we have too much and so many dont have enough? Will we take on the mission, and fulfill our purposes in this life? Every day countless unsaved souls die, how sad, everyday the population in hell grows. I have loved ones that aren't saved, to think of their suffering after this life, its heart wrenching.I pray ... for the courage to get involved, to have the right words to say.I pray ... that God would open their hearts to Him."

God has plans for us, He wants to use us, it is not our lives that we are living, it is His that He mercifully gave to us.
My morning prayer is that i live for God throughout my day. And i see that He is using me.
God was there at the Tree 63 show last night, as we gathered to praise Him. And He wanted to use me, to sponsor a child in need through WorldVision.
I will go wherever He wants me to, i will do what He asks, because He will be with me WHEREVER I GO.
So I will be strong and of good courage."

Anyway, cool day, i was reading my ""Today"" booklet and the author wrote some cool stuff:
""Jesus is the sun that melts the ice of a frozen heart.
Jesus is the artist who sees a masterpiece in a block of limestone.
He sees the person God created you to be, and he draws that forth with the force of his transforming love."""

"event","We can do the impossible, we can change the inalterable, if we only have patience and trust in God to bring about His good will in His own time. I used to become so impatient with myself day after day when i would try to break a bad habit but kept disappointing myself, but before i knew it the sin was no longer a constant in my life; God took it away, im changing like ive always wanted. In the past year, the sins i wanted to get rid of are dying off one by one and its only through God thats its possible to stay that way. But i realize now that changing your life completely around takes time, your heart takes time to heal from letting go of your old ways, and God is making you a new creation. It feels great to feel God holding your hand everyday."

You're the love i've been searching for 
I was looking in all the wrong places
But now i've found you Lord
I feel safe in You, so blessed to know You
No one else can compare
They think they know love, but they haven't found You
You gave me peace, You wiped my tears, i dont cry like before
You healed my broken heart, it doesnt bleed anymore
You opened my eyes, and now i see far more
Father your everything ive ever wanted
I feel safe in You Lord"

I'm leaving it up, because I like the layout and the icons and such.  It shall sit here and rot for all eternity.

I have a new writing journal.  It shouldn't be too hard to find, if you know what you're looking for.

Not that anyone's reading this anyway."

I think starting another LJ just for my writings and fandom commentary was a bad idea.  It's really just proving how unmotivated I am.  I never noticed until I had all my posts lined up with dates on them.

For example, thanks to this journal, I know that I was bitten by the Riddlefic plot-bunny twenty-six days ago - and I'm only just now finishing up my research and timetables for the fic.

...

On second thought... GO ME!  Whoo!  It took less than a month.  Amazing.

But I still need to find a resource for information about common slang terms in the United Kingdom, circa 1950.

As for the NaNo thing, I'm still plotless.  I have my characters, and my setting - I just need a conflict of some sort.  The lack of conflict is also what's preventing me from writing the crossover fic of doom.  Conflict is my weakest point.  It's unsurprising then, that the Riddlefic is purposefully conflict-free."

The crossover fic is beginning to take form, and the idea for a Riddlefic just appeared out of thin air.  I should have been expecting this, as what I <i>want</i> to be doing with my creativity involves coming up with a plot for <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"" target=""_blank"">NaNoWriMo '03.</a>  It's looking as though I may still be unemployed come November, and the panic of writing a novel might be a fun way to kill a month."

"event","So.  I panicked, and I rushed, and I scrapped about three chapters that I was very attached to - and I finished the challenge fic.  And then, at the last minute, I decided not to post it.  I wasn't happy with it.  Chapter two somehow managed to both suck, and blow, at the same time - for one thing.

In chapter three I state that there's going to be a hanging, and then I go and behead the poor girl - which, generally speaking, makes the act of hanging someone rather difficult.

Chapter two I was relatively happy with, but it would have involved sending out an apology/permission request, as I belatedly discovered an unintentional act of plagiarism that I subconsciously committed against a fellow fanfic author...

Not to mention that writing several (annoyingly small) chapters of a fic at three a.m. leads to a few redundancies...  And the m-dashes!  My <i>god</i> the m-dashes!  It made the three m-dashes used in this LJ post look like... ...  something relatively nonexistent.

So... there goes that plan.  But it's ok, because the act of writing something as if other people were going to see it helped me to notice several glaring errors that I make repeatedly in my writing.  Which is good, in the long run.

...

Now if only I could do something about my overall disgusting prose style..."

"event","Tomorrow is the big stat final... I can hear the dreadful music. I cannot believe that I have to be before 8AM!!! This stinks I don't want to take anything that early in the morning. Oh well, but at least I buckled down today to study when my friend Kara called. That was a nice surprise. In the mean time, I think that I'm going to go ahead and look at some anatomy. Then off to bed because I need to get up so early... YUCK!"

"event","Today was another wonderful day (except when I had to study for my finals and do my papers). Greg treated my firend Lisa and I to dinner at III Guys Pizza and a movie. ""13 Going On 30"" was such a cute movie. I loved it! Greg was so funny because I think he laughed more during the movie then Lisa and I did (LOL!). He is such a fun and great guy. I'm still counting the days until I get to go home. I when I get there im going to relax and excercise the whole time because I miss doing that even thought I'm trying very hard to get down to that gym. Well, I'm going to see if I'll be motivated enough to study some antomy and stats and then off to bed. So I'm finally going to say good-night :)"

"event","Well, I know that I was frustrated early today but now I'm feeling really good because Greg is here. He was feeling really ill earlier but now he is okay that he is here with me. I can be his nurse:) I also got my whole entire room almost packed. It was so funny because I kick Tracey and Amanda out of the kitchen tonight because I filled all of my crap up in there. They were so pissed and I could tell because they had no room in there to pre-game and party before they went out. Sometimes I can feel those horns coming out of my head. But, I couldn't help feeling so good that I was able to prevent them from having a good time here. Well, I think that I'm going to study anatomy again because this shit is hard."

"event","I just feel like that I don't have enough time to do anything anymore including working out. I love to go to the gym and get rid of all this nervous engergy, but unfortunately I have to sit on my ass for a bit and actually study. This should have been a crapy day becuase I don't want to study now that it is nice and hot out. Anatomy is going to kill me because I thought I would remember this stuff and of course not! I cannot really remember a FUCKING THING!!!!!!!!!! Makes me so mad. I'm going to be getting my period soon which explains why I have been so bloated and my breats have been killing me. Yuck, Yuck, Yuck! I hate being a woman sometimes. Sometimes I wish I knew what it would be like not to have to worry about a period every month and stupid finals."

"event","When I woke up this morning who would have thought that this would have been a day full of surprises. Well, I went on a rowing this afternoon and I had a blast. Who would have thought? The people in Soar/Service house surprised me. I thought that I was just going to be going on a nice picnic with the people I was going to live with next year. I really do hope that I will fit in and have fun there. I think I will? Well, in the mean time I'm getting ready to go the movies and just came from Stat tutoring (hopefully I do good on that final). I'll have to tell you how my evening goes later :)"

"event","Today was is a good day because very soon I will be out of the hell hole and back to my lovely home in New York. I hate my roommates a lot they are all asshole (Amanda and Tracy) and I wish I hope to never see them again. I am broke because I had to spend a crap load of money on my scrub uniforms. Now I'm studying for my finals. OMG cannot wait till this is over and I can spend time with Greg and the girls from home."

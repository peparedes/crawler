<P><FONT color=#000000>ok i don't really feel like typing that much but i will anyway.&nbsp;on&nbsp;saturday&nbsp;i watched fireworks and all that good stuff. my daddy and i walked down to the boardwalk to see the sparks fly into the water... pretty. i'll post pictures later. the next day mom woke me up early to go pick up my cousin alicia (<lj user=""alicia_lou"" />), she's a cool kid with rad hair. we went to a fair, i guess it was for the fourth of july. you would not believe the amount of adorable boys we saw.&nbsp;we totally whored it up (not literally,&nbsp;der)&nbsp;and did the whole fair thing, and i went on the gravitron and it kicked ass. yesterday the whole fam went on my cousin's husbands' boat, it's called Only in America. heh, how true (yet sort of sad in a ""hey you should think deeper into it"" sort of way). that night alicia had to go home...&nbsp;and i played The Used for her in the car, she really liked them. i have to start getting people into good music more often haha... well maybe better music than The Used. then i had today, and that was boring. blah blah blah... bottom line: carneys are dirty, dirty people.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>oh yeah,&nbsp;i heard this teenage&nbsp;girl with black dreads at subway today saying ""when i grow up, i wanna be a suicidegirl"" with this defiant look on her face to a man that looked like her father (he was wearing a sweatervest, if that matters). i almost choked with laughter, it was brilliant. i love random moments like that.</FONT></P>
<P>my birthday is september 2nd. i say that all the time, i know, but seriously, i want presents. haha. besides, i'm making you all fabulous tshirts. &lt;3</P>
<P>oh yeah, thursday i get to go to&nbsp;my hometown... birmingham mitch-again, represent. or something like that. it's like, this annoying rich connecticut-like city with an actual downtown. it's so adorable, i heart it, it's like home to me. but you know what i noticed about boca? there is no downtown, it's like, entirely composed of strip malls and nice suburban development apartment housing complexes. ugh. it's all... pink, too. but it's grown on me, and now living up here for the summer, algonac has grown on me too.</P>
<P>it's late. i'm gonna go do something constructive, like watch tv. i miss you kids so much!</P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>okay, here's what really confuses me. sometimes kids will see something that another kid has, or is into, like a certain author, or shirt, or band, or whatever, and then they'll notice what else that kid has, personality wise. and let's say, hypothetically, there's a girl that's pretty and has a lot of friends. she also happens to like a certain band and wear a certain kind of clothes. and then, also hypothetically, other girls notice the popular girl and her friends. now, this kind of popularity isn't the cheerleading-football kind. it's the offbeat, ""i go to shows and pierce things and now i'm cool"" kind of popularity. and these girls think, ""what does she have that i don't? why can't i be like her?"" and rush out and buy cd's and makeup and clothes and books and whatever they can find that is just like hers and her friends, in hopes of being scene or whatever. and then, it doesn't work. people don't call the girls who want to be like the popular girl cool or pretty or interesting, like they'd hope. they call them poseurs or something. what does it get those girls, to copy people and fake lives? why would somebody do that? i guess it's low self-esteem, or self-hate, or something inside them that makes them think they're not good enough, like something that happened to them when they were young, or loss of somebody close to them. i don't know, i guess everybody wants to find the best part of themselves, and some people must mistakenly think that the best part of them is somebody else. that's probably where trends&nbsp;come in. why can't you just be yourself? it's not that hard to find something you like personally, and say fuck what everybody else does. it's not like all of this stuff really matters anyway, all of this material stuff. it's impossible to find one ""scene"" or ""label"" that you completely fit into without changing yourself, just like it's impossible to find a church with beliefs that you completely agree with. everybody is totally different, so why are there hoardes of people that look exactly the same? this took way longer than i wanted it to. and it doesn't really make sense. but whatever, i think i made my point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>have you noticed that every once in a while i go off and basically&nbsp;write an essay on here?&nbsp;how weird! but yeah. today was mediocre. yesterday was mediocre. the day before was mediocre. i'm bored. i want home. tomorrow i'm going to a fair, or something. i don't know. i'm still trying to convince my mom to let me go to the&nbsp;warped tour.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>there was horrible pressure to get ready in the morning. bad driving on a one lane road. fry-cook boys yelling at my aunt through the drive through window at mcdonalds. driving by the bank and smiling, because two&nbsp;boys&nbsp;wearing expensive&nbsp;looking shirts and designer jeans&nbsp;are walking in holding hands and carrying mortgage applications. driving five miles out of the way to go to a smoky, greasy diner filled with even smokier, greasier old men and depressed girls working behind the counter. driving down country streets to get to town hall... panic, anger, paperwork &amp; more paperwork, realty and building zones... result in an angry aunt and a somber car ride to the antique store. i found a hitler doll and nazi propaganda (i didn't buy any), a mark ryden passed off as an antique, and told a story to my mother. on to staples for a printer and ink... choices are hard, so i walked next door to barnes and noble.&nbsp;i love&nbsp;book smell. i got a weetzie bat compilation book called dangerous angels (you have to read weetzie bat or else i will hurt you), the new david sedaris (dress your family in corduroy and denim) and my mom got the bill clinton book on audiocassette. we have four or five copies of the hardcover at home, and three copies of the paperback version.&nbsp;there were&nbsp;a large amount of boys in baseball caps buying calvin and hobbes books or arguing over which anime book is better, etc. we drove home through back ways and dirt roads and brown fields, and got lost ... but we made it (obviously.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>once upon a time, in a small marine town, there was this girl that was on vacation. all of her friends were at home and she didn't particularly feel like being with her family 24/7. (she hated when people spelled things with numbers, as well, but i had to add that pop culture reference to preserve the integrity of the story.) one day some woman that was related to her in a way she wasn't sure of gave her a gift in a flashy novelty gift bag. (the gift isn't really worth mentioning, but i think it might be a really good way to use foreshadowing.) the gift was a fake silver charm bracelet with beads in ""fun"" ocean colors and charms with fish and dolphins on them. the gift bag was a whole other story. it was white and it said (and i quote)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc size=2><STRONG>A giRL ALWAys NeeDs NeW sTuff!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>and it had a garish&nbsp;cartoon of a woman in a floral dress smiling at an array of sunglasses, lipstick, perfume, shoes, a cell phone, a purse, a cup of coffee, and a slice of cake. the girl accepted the&nbsp;bracelet with a hug and waited until the gift-giver left before tossing away the hideous and distasteful novelty gift bag (which was manufactured by Garven.)</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1>i kept hurting taylor. this was the third time. i don't think you should have to work at a relationship, though. i think it should come naturally, and i had to work at it around him. i sort of put up a front and started feeling depressed after a while every time. he&nbsp;was pretty&nbsp;upset, and i told him he'd find somebody else. (i know he will, too. i know a lot of girls have crushes on him.) but then he said that he didn't want to fall in love ever again. i know that's not true, though.&nbsp;he's young, and he's going to find somebody perfect for him. he thinks i was, but i wasn't. in other news, i'm going to make something pretty as soon as i update this and get offline... oh shit. and do my homework too. fuck fuck fuck. i was watching adult swim last night and laughed the whole fucking way through, that doesn't always happen. but it was great. </FONT><FONT size=1>have you heard of rachel yamagata? fucking beautiful voice. she just came on conan and i looked her up, and she's totally indie. hope she doesn't go the way of coheed and cambria, and modest mouse and join the MTV bandwagon. i swear, that station kills more amazing musicians. i still love coheed... it just doesn't make sense that they would go on MTV of their own accord. this has to be the work of some weird government conspiracy or something. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>anyway. this one girl started saying how me not liking MTV and mainstream music made me closed-minded. then she proceeds to diss on the lovely <STRONG>to kill a mockingbird</STRONG>. so i had to say ""wow, your taste in music and literature sucks."" she made some lame comeback like ""thanks.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>but seriously, isn't it the other way around? i think people like that are too lazy to get off their fucking asses, turn off the television, and get out of the house and go to a fucking show, or go meet people that don't spend all their free time at the hot topic at the mall. i don't think people like her would know good music if it bit them in the ass, and that's not their fault. i mean, we've all been spoonfed crap since we were in the womb so it's natural to be in the mainstream, it's easy. but what about finding what you really like? i know for a fact not everybody listens to the same shit, because not everybody has the same musical tastes. now, if she really does like hoobastank and yellowcard and linkin park and limp bizkit and evanescence, that's a different story. then it just means she has absolutely horrible taste. but if she's just pretending to, then she's LAAAAAAAAME.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>i ran out of things to say.... oh yes. <STRONG>to kill a mockingbird</STRONG> blows all other books out of the motherfucking water. even brackish water! (say that out loud. i'm serious, you'll love it.) ok well i'm going to go now.......................... call me or im me or something and we'll figure out something to do this weekend.</FONT></P>

(sarah, winky wink! yeah, psh you know what i'm talking bout.) haha, at lunch mike kept saying how he wanted to take my innocence. it was disconcerting, funny, oddly sweet and adorable, and hot at the same time. at home, things could be better, could be worse. we're still sort of bad in the money department, but otherwise i'm pretty happy. tonight my mom wants to see Mean Girls, so i guess i'm going to go see that. from what everybody says, it seems alright. ohh man. i'm so fucking confused right now. you should know what i'm talking about, if you don't then you probably suck. my life has gotten so graphic! i feel like i'm in a sitcom or a reality show or something. i was a bitch today to everybody that i don't like and it felt damn good. haha. i usually try not to be, try to be sweet to absolutely everybody, but some people just deserve it. yeah, you know who i'm talking about. shut up, you've bitched her out too. i know you did. hm, what happened today? first hour, read. bleh. second hour, designed&nbsp;masks, mike stopped by to chat. lunch, i already explained.&nbsp;third hour, sarah and i worked our asses off and still have to come in tomorrow morning. brittany was pissed off, she always is pissed off at me and/or sarah. fourth hour,&nbsp;we&nbsp;read yearbooks and alex pretended to make out with me. i&nbsp;instinctively put my hands up in front of my face to block her. haha. oh man, good times in french class. well,&nbsp;i'll probably end up posting an entry later coz i have no life, so for now i'm gonna go. love you!</P>

"event","<FONT color=#ffffff size=2> fucking lovely day. went to church and got confirmed, still don't know what the hell that's all about. i wore a white robe and felt like priest bait. they gave me this large cross that's supposed to hang up somewhere or something.... but i just used it as bling. it was rizzeal, fo shizzeal. my noelle bought me a sephora gift certificate, which i will certainly be spending tomorrow. fuck yes, i want some new makeup. i love gifts. anybody can give me one, you know. you don't need a reason.

wow, i really feel like doing something along the lines of fucking. that's pretty interesting, considering i spent the majority of the day in church. i guess suppression really is the way to getting hot. fuck. it's working.

nothing else to say. comment, fuckers. you're pissing me off. </FONT>

"event","<FONT color=#ffffff size=2> <P>i woke up this morning feeling perfectly posey, and ready to start a happy day. i go into my mom's room to say good morning and she says ""i hate to do this so early in the morning, but--"" and she gives me a grade she got on edline. i have a D in french, when just yesterday i had an A! it totally bites it wrecked my morning. so i threw a childish fit and my mom started yelling at me telling me to grow up and&nbsp;take responsibilities for my grades and&nbsp;that sort of thing (even though i'm in the process of growing up right now, and i do take fucking responsibilities for my grades.) lovely fucking morning i had.</P>
<P>then she tells me after i calm down somewhat that we have absolutely no money until monday so the lunch i'm making tomorrow for my confirmation will have to be made with whatever we have at home. joy and happiness. but it turned out alright, coz she found a $20. yay. i'm gonna make for an appetizer, brie with melted apricots and brown sugar....&nbsp;a spinach, romaine, tomato, cucumber, and&nbsp;oil and vinegar dressing...&nbsp;fish tacos with mango salsa for the main course... and i dont know what i'm going to make for dessert. i fucking love cooking. it's so fun and relaxing.</P>
<P>i think today i'm going to my aunt's house to pick it up a little bit and get my stuff out of the guest room. somebody's buying her house.... tear. i can't imagine not being able to go to my aunt's country club anymore. it's such a constant. but now the cottage up north is a constant! ooh, i love it.</P>
<P>listen to the olivia tremor control's album called Music from the Unrealized Film Script Dusk at Cubist Castle. it's so great. brilliant fucking music. brilliant. speaking of music... i want to go to pis tonight but i can't. that fully sucks. i have this huge church thing tomorrow, and besides, nobody can go. i hate that sort of thing.</P>
<P>on the bright side, the penguin menorah i made in art class at school should be done monday. yay! alright, so it's not really a menorah. but it is eight penguins on a little block/plaque thing. anyway. gotta jet.</P> </FONT>

"event","i think that, on porn sets, the makeup artists must have to use a lot of really good concealer. to cover both the acne on the girls' faces from having dried jizz on them constantly, and to cover the blue bruises on their thighs that must constantly occur during filming. once i saw a porn movie late night on hbo. it wasn't sexy at all. the lighting was horrid, the girl's nipples were shiny, it was packed with violent and messy money shots, and the plot was tragically bad. so, kiddies, that's why you should never watch porn on hbo. (unless you're watching real sex, which doesn't count as porn, but it's pretty damn funny. except for the one with the people that dressed up like horses on that fucked-up farm. that gave me really bad dreams and whatnot.)</P>
<P>on a lighter note, i think that dear catastrophe waitress, by belle &amp; sebastian, could very well be a most kickass song. ""he hit you with a full can of coke, it's no joke! your face is bleeding..."" oh, good times.</P>
<P>i just got my hair cut today and it looks damn good, thank you.</P>
<P>... ohh man. i just spent like an hour talking with this kid from chicago. he's pretty cool. we bonded over hair, scruff mcgruff memories, and stories of immigrants from our ""brothers down under."" (i.e. haitians, dominicans, cubans.)</P>
<P>i have nothing else to say really, except that i think life would be great if those sheep from the serta commercials could rap to you before bed each night.

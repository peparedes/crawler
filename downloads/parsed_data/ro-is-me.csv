"event","alright...guess its about time for me to update this journal...so whats been happening in my life...not to much really...making final preparations for my wedding...yay...had a potential donor coming out...things changed...bah...so now im really feeling sick...whats new...guess i should just get used to feeling ill than feeling well since its so hard for me to find a donor..and when i do...i either see them every 6 months, or, i have to tell them dont bother to come out because i would only be able to see them like a few hours out of a week they would be here...so it would be useless for them to make a long drive out here for a week and not see them. bah...whatever...im just tired, and ill, and just not in the mood for much of anything.  anywho...thats whats been happening...we will see what happens next."

"event","alright, so im soooooooooooo falling behind schedule for Halloween...yea yea...Halloween isnt for another 2 months...but i usually start designing stuff for halloween like nov. 1st of the previous year....and i should be done with most everything by now...but newp...im late.  this year the ""mortuary"" will be held at our apartment...hmmm...i wonder where i could put the hearse at...yea thats right, a hearse...for all those who dont know...for last year, i built a full size horse-drawn hearse.  this year's big project will be my Seance Scene...got inspired by the Madame Leota illusion from the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. hopefully i will get it done in time.

invitations are all done...flyers are done...just need to finish the designs for the apartment...yea yea...got my priorities straight...invites are done...but the apartment isnt...lol...the home-version of my Seance Scene is very very simple to do, and if all goes well, would look fantabulous....oh hey...guess what......76 Days Until Halloween... (starts to sing) ""Grim Grinning Ghosts Come Out to Socialize...."""

SO my birthday is coming up this weekend...wonder what jennifer has planned that she isnt telling me.  grr...so frustrating....ya know...thinking back...all this LJ stuff is reminding me of Dooger Houser....I wonder how many people actually remember that. bah...random thought."

"event","so i pretty much had it with my car wanting to start whenever she feels like it...so i took her to the dealership and guess what the problem was...not the starter, not the spark plugs, not the alternator or battery...ya see...newer cars have these laser cut keys with this chip in it...preventing anyone from trying to start the car with a copy of the key. well the sensor in my car was faulty and it was reading that MY key was not the real key...so the anti-theft device in my car was preventing my car to start...hmmm...damned new cars...i remember back in the day when i could start my old toyota camry with a bobby pin and some aluminum foil. (god bless McGuyver for that idea). so YAY...my car is fine...i hope...i will give it a few weeks before i REALLY celebrate...time for me to race her again <weg>"

"event","so i ""started"" to work on my new project here at the apartment...making an evening garden with night blooming flowers and night fragrant flowers...the reason why i put the word started in quotes is because, well, you really cant do much in a garden when ya got no cash for the bulbs and seeds..so technically it was more me playing in dirt...ooooh...look...more dirt...time for me to play with more."

We took Grandma out of the home today, drank wine by the river, then went and visited grandpa. She loves him so much... its heartbreaking that they cant just be together... but she said this was the ""best day of her life"" and it was very sweet.&nbsp;But at the end of the day, as we were all leaving, she was bawling. She misses her Jimmy. 

I can't stand the thought of them being in homes... but in seperate homes? It seems too cruel for two people who have been married for 65 years to spend the last part of their lives apart. Gaaaah it boggles my brain and makes me cry. But nobody in our family (myself aside) sees any point in trying to find a solution to this problem. I'm screaming inside... 

... the bell jar. What a depressing book (really not my taste at all) but the concept of the ""bell jar"" is very real. And it doesn't just apply to young repressed women. My grandparents are certainly trapped inside isolated bell jars.&nbsp; 

- 

Age terrifies me. 

The passage of time terrifies me.&nbsp; 

I'm paralyzed by decisions. I have so much in front of me, and I do nothing.&nbsp; 

Is my relationship damaging my ambitions? Am I doomed to repeat the mistakes of countless women before me? Is ""success"" a tangible goal? Should I ditch the emotions and haul ass to NYC or Washington, in pursuit of a great career and metropolitan lifestyle? If I dont establish any goals, how&nbsp;can I fulfill them? 

If my goal is happiness, I can achieve that by sitting and watching a sunset with mr. poon. 

Sentimental fool! you'll never get anywhere in life. 

I sent Mikey a message today, and he wrote back almost instantly. I told him I wasn't coming to New York... he told me I should, that airfare is cheap. But he also told me that he is coming to Los Angeles the same day that I go back! I'm excited to see him. We have a ridiculously messy history, but he always makes me smile. God he's such a nerd, but so quirky and charming and sometimes its like he's looking straight into me. He knows me in a way that Nate doesn't... Nate has treated me infinitely better, but with Mikey there was this instant spark. I fell&nbsp;for him right away and though it was completely naive and juvenile and poorly expressed, it was love. It made my head scream. It was like we had this special connection that nobody else could penetrate. I still miss the nights i'd stay awake, just lying in bed with him... no sex, just talking... about hundreds of silly little pointless things that we both loved. Music, books, etc. All of my senses were excited... electric... and though it was painfully brief, he made me feel like the only girl in the world. Nate has never given me that. He's too rational and emotionally undemonstrative. And maybe Mikey was full of shit, but the illusion he created was absolutely lovely.&nbsp; 

But I love Nate. And Mikey is mostly dead to me. The timing was all wrong. Besides, he was manipulative (I probably was too). I think we both hurt each other too much to ever be more than friends. 

and I LOVE NATE. Goddamnit I do. I just wish he was... i dont know... passionate? jealous?? irrational??? i dont know... honestly, I just wish he'd fallen for me instantly. I cant change the past. As for the present- I wish he was more demonstrative with his emotions. When he told me his grandmother had a brain tumor (which we later learned was not the case), I was choked up for a&nbsp;long time, turning my face away, letting quiet tears stream down my face. I couldn't let him see because he was so stoic about it all... or zen? I'm not sure which it is. I'm never sure if he's actually ""zen"" about something or if he's just covering up his emotions with the guise of zenness.&nbsp; All I know is that I sure do cry a lot, and I feel foolish for it.&nbsp;

He lives with me, but he never says ""i love you"" on his own, its always in reponse to me saying it first. He never gets too angry or upset about anything. And although I keep telling him--Nate, i'm upset about our past, I'm insecure about everything--he doesn't give me the reassurance i'm seeking. He needs to tell me, ""to hell with the other girls, you're the only one. You're beautiful, you're everything, I wanted you before I just couldn't say it"" etc. When guys talk like that, is it nothing but bullshit? FINE give me the bullshit, give me the illusion, fine fine fine. Just give me something sweet to dream about when you're not with me, because right now all i've got are nightmares about you saying ""no"" when I ask you out, and you leaving me for your exes, and you cheating on me with random supermodels. 


Oh well. I'll see him tomorrow and i'll try to pull a little more passion out of that boy if I can. 


This post took an unexpected tangent, but I checked my messages as I was writing so there you have it. 


Passion 
is the fashion 
that we wear 
when we are bare&nbsp;

Baby wont you please take it all off??"

"event","<p>Buddhism is a crock of shit.<br /><br />But Taoism is relatively thoughtful (as far as organized religions go).&nbsp;I like the guiding ethics of compassion, moderation and humility. I like the concept of Tao (flow of universe or whatnot) but not so much Wu Wei: ""without action"". Taoist philosophy assumes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways... ""when someone exerts his will against the world, he disrupts that harmony"". As far as i'm concerned, the universe isn't necessarily the way it should or should not be, but it certainly is not harmonious. There are definitely some kinks that need working out-- for example, mass poverty and suffering- and people need to take very active steps to deal with this. The Taoist perspective is dangerous because it can be interpreted to mean: ""just go with the flow"" [of the universe].&nbsp;<br /><br />I argue that mankind's tiny portion of the universe is often very&nbsp;stormy, and we've got to row like mothafuckers to get into clearer waters. And even if, we zoom way the fuuuuuck out, and the macro-universe seems harmonious, its still full of those storms. Anywhere that concious beings are struggling for survival, its gonna be storming.&nbsp;<br /><br />Aw geeze im so stoney.<br /></p>"

"event","&nbsp;Ok.

I am hoping this is the calm after the storm. I'm feeling better. Could easily blame everything on girly hormones but I think I was justified in my upset. I filled up labor day weekend with hardcore college fun...

Friday night&nbsp;- drove to berkely, got sexy and fucked up on absinthe with allie, smoked bowls in bart, rode out to the city and partied until the bars closed. Our timing couldn't have been better... it was a warm night in SF, the Bart was open all night because of bay bridge construction, and everybody was out partying in full force this labor day weekend. The bartride home was ridiculously packed... we really were sardines...&nbsp; stole a cab from in front of dozens of angry oaklanders... got back to allies and got hiiiiigh in the garage.&nbsp;

Saturday - woke up sans hangover, thanks to belvedere vodka tonics at all the bars. Smoked, had AMAZING food, went swimming at the Claremont. very swanky. Drove home, spent a couple hours there, then drove to Nate's for drinking and party prep.

Sunday- spent the whole day at nate's, preparing for his dad's sixtieth bday party. Lots of prep in the morning... the party was really fantastic. It was huge. Most&nbsp;delicious potluck ever.&nbsp;Edwin, Thomas and Aaron were there too. Smoked too much, drank too much, ate too much... got WAY too much sun. Waged pool war with little children, snuck around the property smoking and drinking wine, fell a little harder for mr. poon.

had a fantastic first&nbsp; _____.

oh.

Monday- hung around. took it easy. went shooting. im such a good shot.&nbsp;me nad nate are a pair of NBKs. like bonnie and clyde. went to REI and found a camel pack on sale for $65... bought it... aaaand tomorrow, is nates birthday.&nbsp;

but man im wiped. and i just got home to discover my parents have cleaned all the rugs / moved furnitue but i've got to move it back now and finish the walls in my bedroom. wheweee. i'll be nice and stoned while working at least .

i pretty much live out of my backpack these days. its a nice feeling. siiiiimple. life is sweet. im so enamored. scared still. the grass really is greener here, but i guess im worried about a dryspell... or getting kicked out of the pasture...&nbsp;"

"event","i'm so scared and so confused. i should be happy. i got what i wanted.&nbsp;but the way it&nbsp; came about was all wrong. too hard. too forced. nate said he was happy this morning, but yesterday he didn't want it. he&nbsp;said he absolutely did not want a relationship.&nbsp;i insisted, because i couldn't really handle the thought of life without him. and i cried. so he said he'd try. my brain was screaming ""mistake"" even right then. but i'd have felt like much more of an idiot if i had given up.&nbsp; 

its so good. he acts like he cares, he says he cares... but i dont know how much, and i dont know if its enough. i dont know if he was actually willing to give up on us, or if he was counting on me to crumble and stick with an open relationship. 

but i cant. i had to&nbsp;insist. because i&nbsp;love him, i suddenly love every fucking part of him, and i've got to stand up for that. god i should be happy. i asserted myself, i'm finally in a monogamous relationship with a guy i truly care about, and we have so many good times ahead of us. 

... 

but it should have been different. he should have wanted it more. 

...


which is why i'm fleeing to the city tonight, eagerly anticipating drunken debauchery and harmless flirtation."

I smoke, i'm a poonstress... this handle works perfectly, and it pays tribute to the glory days of cheap wine and wasted birthdays.</p><p>So its&nbsp;the beginning of summer. Probably my last college summer. I'm half-in-love, dreaming of europe, and preparing for a new job at a local non-profit.&nbsp;<br /><br />No class until October.<br /><br />Sweet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

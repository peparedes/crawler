"event","Last Monday I went to Notre Dame law school to visit the school and attend a seminar.&nbsp; The campus is beautiful and I think it has moved to number one on my perspective school list.&nbsp; The international law center in London is also a big plus.&nbsp; I put some pictures of it up on facebook so check it out.&nbsp; Now on to things that are bothering me:<br /><br />1.) ESPN.com, I check this website several times a day and lately the writiing in the articles has bothered me with some of the sentences they use.&nbsp; This sentence is an example ""Anna Benson, an actress and model who has posed topless, filed for divorce in Atlanta on March 31.""&nbsp; What does the fact that Anna Benson has posed topless have to do with the fact that she is filing for divorce?&nbsp; These next two sentences from a different article also bothered me. ""Hours after an exotic dancer was allegedly raped by members of the Duke University lacrosse team, a player apparently sent an e-mail saying he wanted to invite more strippers to his dorm room, kill them and skin them. It was not clear whether the message was serious or a joke.""&nbsp; The last sentence is the one that bothers me.&nbsp; I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that he was joking, but lets pretend that he was serious would you really send out an e-mail letting all your teammates know that your were planning to do it.<br /><br />2.) The next thing that is bothering me is the kid that sits behind me in my global Ilasmic politcs class.&nbsp; On Monday he came to to class dress in black sweatpants and a black sweatshirt, that's fine alot of of people go to class dressed like that.&nbsp; But what bothered me was his choice of footwear, he wore black dress shoes.&nbsp; No matter how hard you try wearing dress shoes with sweatpants does not make it classier.&nbsp; Today this same kind continued to make references to the Ninja Turtles during the class discussion, keep in mind this is a class about global Islmaic politics I don't see much of a corealation.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.) Next is Tom Delay, what you did was wrong please go away.&nbsp; Stop trying to blame the fact you took money from Jack Abrahmoff on liberals.&nbsp; Stop going to talk shows talking about how you have friends in the Christian right and you might go work for them.&nbsp; Just go back to Texas and drink mimosas with Ross Perot.<br /><br />4.) Cynthia McKinney the reason the capitol hill police officer grabbed you was because you did not stop at the security check point not because you are ""a female black congresswoman.""&nbsp; There are real issues of racism this is not one of them.&nbsp; Just admit you were wrong and face your punishment, don't make it into a race issue because it is not one.<br /><br />That is all that bothers me for now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in honor of Tom Delay I&nbsp; leave you with one of my favorite quotes from him,&nbsp; good thing he still clings to sterotypes from the 1950s, ""<span class=""body"">A woman can take care of the family. It takes a man to provide structure, to provide stability.</span>""<span class=""bodybold"" />"

In my business law class I learned two very interesting facts the first being that the legal age of consent for marriage in Kentucky and Tennesse is 12 and the second being that in Kentucky you can marry your first cousin.  I also read in one of the local papers that a couple in Shepard that had ben posing as a married couple were in fact brother and sister.  To top it off they had three children.  I went to b-dubs tonight with Brett, Carol, Dan Calvin and several other people the food was good and we ""borrowed"" a bottle of ketchup.
I went to the U Cup the other night and had an interesting conversation with a Mt. Pleasant native.  I was reading one of my political science books and this guy comes over and sits at the table next to me.  The guy looked like he belonged in Deliverence.  We started talking about politics and got on the topic of gun control.  His position on gun control was citizens should be able to possess any weapon the government has. In order to clarify his position I asked if this included chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, he said yes and believed that people should trust him more than the trust the government.  People like this scare me.

Homecoming weekend was so much fun, I went to a party Saturday and found out that I own people at flip cup.
I think I am the only person not at all stressed out by mid terms.
I have been listening to an unhealthy amount of 80's new wave, all the synthesizers and keytars are killing what brain cells I have left.
Much like Ben Franklin I am always seeking self improvement and in order to better myself I am learning some Turkish and I believe I have already learned the most useful phrase in the Turkish language.  The phrase is ""Bira istiyorum"" it roughly translates into I would a beer.

After class i went and saw the Corpse Bride with Brett and ate some Gumbo for dinner.  I think I'm going to make crab cakes at some point this week and try to find a theatre in Mt.

"event","At first I supported Cindy Sheehan in her protesting the war in Iraq and her campout in Crawford, Texas over the summer, but things have now changed.  After seeing her on Hardball today I realized she sounds remarkably  similar to a thirteen year old girl when she talks about her opinions on the war.  She could not find a clear reason why she doesn't support the war and seems to think that senators will change their mind on supporting the war after talking to her.  She also holds the belief that the only reason senators still support the war is that because they have some sort of self interest in it.  If she gave it a little more thought she might come to the conclusion that since we are stuck in Iraq for the next several years it would be to our benefit to completely fund the nation buidling so troops don't have to go back in ten years.
  On a lighter note I'm going to be heading home this weekend.  At the moment I'm not sure if I'm leaving Thursdaay after class or Friday after Michigan's Law Day, but I should be back in time for the football game friday night.  If anybody wants to do anything over the weekend give me a call, Saturday night will be particularly boring.

After my tours I went to the Central/Eastern game,  Central ended up losing 23-20 in overtime. For the rest of the day i didn't do anything of much importance, but arouund 2 this morning I was flipping through the channels on my TV.  I stopped on ESPN 2 to watch the Stump the Schwab, a sports trivia game show, and noticed one of the contestants looked very familiar.  As it turned out that contestant was Mr. Moore.  He did pretty good, he didn't win but he wasn't the first person eliminated.  It was a kind of surreal experience watching him on TV.

"event","I went to Cedar Point over the weekend for my fundraising requirement for Phi Alpha Delta.  We left Friday around 12 and got to Cedar Point around 5:30, after getting halfway to Cleveland before we figured out we missed the exit.  After a short orientation we had the rest of the night to enjoy the park.  After leaving the park at 11 we went to TGI Fridays until they closed at midnight.  Not wanting to sleep we all went over to Louie's Bar until around 1:30.  Louie's reminds me of somebody's basement with a walk out patio, it was a great bar with cheap beer.  They also didn't seem to care about how was drinking just as long as you didn't cause any trouble.  We had to start working as carnies the next day at 10, I was assigned to some store in the back of the park the sells over-priced crap that people still insist on buying.  The guy I got to work with, Tomasz, was a student from Poland working here for the summer.  Tomasz did not have the ""Protestant Work Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism"" as described by Max Weber. Instead his advice to me as very American, ""It doesn't matter how hard you work here because the work is very easy.""  So rather than working hard we spent most of the day talking about soccer and why the Poolish are just Germany's version of rednecks.  We left the park around 9 and I went to Fridays with Amber and her friend Ashley to get some food before heading back to Louie's, this time we stayed there until closing at 2.  We then made the short walk back to the small dorms we were housed in for the weekend and we tried ordering pizza at 3:30 in the morning but to our surprise nothing was open, I finally went to bed around 4.  The next day I worked alone at a cart and made around $40 in sales and half of that was from a t-shirt. I got out of work around 6:30 and rode the train for an hour with Chris and Andrew until Uncle Geno was done working.  Before we left Ohio we had to stop and buy fireworks.  We got back to Mt. Pleasant around 1:30 and when we dropped off Chris and Andrew at Fox Run apartments Andrew decided it would be a good idea to light off one of his thunder stick firecrackers.  It was a pretty fun weekend and a chance to hang out with some friends.

Dead Kennedys ""Moral Majority""

You call yourself the Moral Majority
We call ourselves the people in the real world
Trying to rub us out, but we're going to survive
God must be dead if you're alive

You say, 'God loves you. Come and buy the Good News'
Then you buy the president and swimming pools
If Jesus don't save 'til we're lining your pockets
God must be dead if you're alive

Circus-tent con-men and Southern belle bunnies
Milk your emotions then they steal your money
It's the new dark ages with the fascists toting bibles
Cheap nostalgia for the Salem Witch Trials

Stodgy ayatollahs in their dobble-knit ties
Burn lots of books so they can feed you their lies
Masturbating with a flag and a bible
God must be dead if you're alive

Blow it out your ass, Jerry Falwell
Blow it out your ass, Jesse Helms
Blow it out your ass, Ronald Reagan
What's wrong with a mind of my own?

You don't want abortions, you want battered children
You want to ban the pill as if that solves the problem
Now you wanna force us to pray in school
God must be dead if you're such a fool

You're planning for a war with or without Iran
Building a police state with the Ku Klux Klan
Pissed at your neighbour? Don't bother to nag
Pick up the phone and turn in a fag

Blow it out your ass, Terry Dolan
Blow it out your ass, Phyllis Schlafly
Ram it up your cunt, Anita
Cos God must be dead
If you're alive
God must be dead
If you're alive"

You might be thinking those remarks came from somebody like Howard Dean, Ted Kennedy or Nancy Pelosi.  Those remarks really came from Chuck Hagel a senator from Nebraska, I should also mention that he is a republican.  Republicans are now begining to lose faith in the President, who has been ineffective in getting his domestic adgenda to pass in spite of having control of both houses.  The question now has to be asked, are the Republicans are delusional or just misleading the American people about the state of things in Iraq?

  Next Summer the World Cup will be in Germany and I think Brazil will beat Germany to win the World Cup.  Brazil has alot of scoring with Ronaldo, Kaka, Ronaldinho, and Rivaldo.  Germany has great defense but their goalkeeper, Oliver Kahn, will be 37 by the time the World Cup starts.  Their scoring mostly relies on two players Michael Ballack and Miroslav Klose.

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out ""My God they killed them all""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done

The champion of the world.

Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello moving around mysteriously
""I didn't do it"" he says and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbing the register I hope you understand
I saw them leaving"" he says and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
In the hot New Jersey night.

Meanwhile far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Patterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not shown up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat.

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the corps
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said ""I saw two men running out they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said ""Wait a minute boys this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men.

Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says ""Wha'd you bring him in here for ? He ain't the guy !""
Yes here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Four months later the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him looking for somebody to blame
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar ?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law ?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter you saw running that night ?""
""Don't forget that you are white"".

Arthur Dexter Bradley said ""I'm really not sure""
Cops said ""A boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail be a nice fellow
You'll be doing society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim"".

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work he'd say and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The DA said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed.

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder 'one' guess who testified
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand ?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game.

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put him in a prison cell but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world."

"event","The republican controlled house today approved a bill that would allow drilling in ANWR (Artic National Wildlife Refuge).  The bill gives $8.1 billion in tax breaks to coal, nuclear, oil, and natural gas companies; this really isn't a surprise if you now anything about the republican party.  Why not give that $8.1 billion to comparies that are working on developing alternate fuel sources, if oil usage rates continue we have between 40-75 years worth of oil left to drill.  An amendment that would require automakers to have an average miles per gallon of 33 was defeated.  33 miles per gallon is not a ridiculos number, but why would  a republican house member want to put pressure on the companies that financed his/her campaign.
The state house in Texas passed a bill banning gay foster parents because apparently they would rather have a child stuck in a horrible child care system (several children were killed in the past year by foster parents) than have them go to a loving family in which the parents happen to be gay.   ""It is our responsibility to make sure that we protect our most vulnerable children and I don't think we are doing that if we allow a foster parent that is homosexual or bisexual,"" Rep. Robert Talton.  Guess which party this man belongs to.  That's right he is the typical republican bigot.  If you don't believe in gay marriage or you believe that gay people are going to burn in hell, that is your own personal choice.  Don't impose that belief on other people especially when children hwo need a loving home are involved.
""I actually feel sorry for people who have a lot of illusions in their head about what gay is. I mean, I know some gay people who are really wonderful people."" -Richard Chamberlain"

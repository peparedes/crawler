"event","I'm back!  Lopez Island was really fun but I'm so tired.  It was a very relaxing weekend.  A few interesting things happened.  We almost missed the ferry going there and coming back.  On the way there we stopped to buy fruit at a roadside stand, which is such a necessary thing to do when you're not sure if you're even going to make it on time.  We made it, though.  Today we were even closer to missing it and the two cars of the people in our group were the last two on the ferry.  Also, there were two Coast Guard Boats escorting our ferry, which was kind of weird.  Makes you a little bit uneasy about riding on there.  I kept mentioning things about bombs then, and Dani kept telling me to stop talking about them because I might be overheard (you know,I'm really suspicious).  

Here's one of the most interesting things, though: I saw Johnny Depp!!!  Nina, you would have died if you'd been there.  Well, ok, I didn't actually see him but I swear I saw his twin.  Complete Jack Sparrow look going on.  Eye liner, braided goatee, red head scarf, same eyes- so hot!  He works at the espresso place in the Lopez Island village.  I got his picture (hahaha)which maybe I'll post if I feel like taking the trouble.  I practically choked on the ice cream I was eating when he walked by me.  

We also did a lot of shopping, eating good food and hanging around the house.  Dani straightened my hair twice, and I love it!  It is finally down to a manageable thickness.  No more frizz.  Don't get me wrong, I love my hair, but there is way too much of it.  I also finished scrapbooking our day at the lake on the last day of school last year.  It made me sad because Jenna was there and she wasn't here this year to organize an end-of-year lake party.  :(  Maybe we'll have another lake day sometime this summer.

I also had time up there to finish the book I was reading, The Queen's Fool.  It was sooo good! (Thanks again for giving it to me, Nina).  I bought one of the other books by the same author and want to buy the third one.  I love historical fiction, and especially books about Henry VIII, Mary and Elizabeth I's reigns.  Right now, though, I'm getting into the Harry Potter book.  So far I like it, but I'm only 60 pages into it or so.  It's sad, I can't even remember what happened in the 5th book.  I can't believe how creative JK Rowling is, how she can think of all these new characters, new spells, new creatures, etc.  

Well, now that I'm done with updating Livejournal and Facebook I can get on with my life.  I'm really obsessed now, especially with Facebook.  So far I have 8 friends at PLU, but that's pretty good for having no one else from IHS going there.  I've found a lot of people from Minnesota, which is funny because Minnesota is like my second home.  Of course many Minnesota Lutherans come to PLU.  There's even a Scandanavian cultural center there and the front part of a Viking ship.  Hahaha.  My mom thinks I'll meet a guy from Minnesota and we'll get married and then we can move back there or go back all the time to visit our family.  That would be so cool because I love going there.  Despite the snow, cold, humidity and mosquitos.  And I like the Minnesota accents too, especially how they say ""about.""  

Well, really got to go now.  Hope everyone's having an awesome summer!  Send me an e-mail/im/message/post/telegram/carrier pigeon or whatever else you can think of!"

"event","Hi All!  I know that no one will probably read this, but oh well.  This is actually my first post because Nina did the other one.  So ignore that.  Anyway, I finally broke down and got a livejournal because of insistance from a certain friend of mine.  I know it's going to be a nice distraction for me (as if I need more).  Well, not much to say right now.  I'm going to walk Abe with my dad.  Ok, bye for now!"

"event","The time is all weird on this entry because my computer's date was set a day ahead and I just fixed it.  So really teh 1:27 entry was yesterday.  I'm off to Lopez Island for the weekend.  Hopefully my mom and I will survive a weekend together without biting each others' heads off.  It just gets stressful when we're both trying to pack and get ready for a trip.  It won't (is it wont or won't?) be just the two of us, though, there will be three of my friends and their moms.  I'm really excited- I've been going to Lopez with the same people since I was a baby.  I'm planning to accomplish something in my scrapbook- I'm almost done with junior year and then I'm starting a whole new book just for senior year.  I also am going to start reading Harry Potter.  I decided I better read it because Nina said there was a big twist at the end, and I'm curious to find out what it is.  Hopefully the weekend will be nice and relaxing.  And hopefully no wheels will fall off cars on the way up.  Well, gotta go now.  Hope everyone has a nice weekend!"

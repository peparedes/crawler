"event","Saturday - Decided to make a dedicated server for all my stuff, Got the stuff to make the computer. put it together I now have no Nvidia Geforce 2. reason being, Some weird substance was spilled on the Circuit board and shorted all the crap out and blew up taking half the Motherboard with it,
Sunday - Decided to take another shot at this crap with a new motherboard and powersupply, After i hooked all the crap up I turned it on and It worked!, well, before the powersupply started to smoke, actually, it started to smoke quite intensely so i unplugged it and about 3 minutes later its still fogging up my basment, about 10 minutes later, 
I took it apart to Diagnose the problem, I realized that One of the power capicators was exploded and the juice was everyware, shorting out other things. I noticed the cap was only rated for 16v and usually there 200v or 150v so that could have been something to do with it I dont know I cant wait to see what tommarow will bring upon me. and my lungs.

Oh yeah, then one of my friends that are in our band decided a song i picked he didnt like that style of music, Which freaked the crap out of me becaused Firstly, he Suggested it to me about a month earlier, And he lives by that Pantera - megadeath - metallica - mushagga, death metal , so i dont know what to do seeing as i am now missing a drummer and a bass player. the reason my drummer isnt gonna do it is because he is in like 18 bands and i dont think thattd work. to well. but i dont know, 
one of my newer friends wants me to help him Configure a server and an FTP site and he likes every dam thing i do so we get along preety cool, plus me and him can get hooked up with some cheap good new Computer parts, Via his friend working at Cygnus Systems, YatZee!"

Who wore her shoplifted bikini.
She heard a loud pop,
And off came her top
And had nothing on in betweenie!


What's blue and sits in the corner?
A baby in a plastic bag.

What's green and sits in the corner?
THe same baby a week later.


A woman was walking along the beach when she stumbled upon a Genie's lamp. She picked it up and rubbed it, and lo-and-behold a Genie appeared.

The amazed woman asked if she got three wishes.

The Genie said, ""Nope. . . due to inflation, constant downsizing, low wages in third-world countries, and fierce global competition, I can only grant you one wish. So. . . what'll it be?""

The woman didn't hesitate. She said,

""I want peace in the Middle East. See this map? I want these countries to stop fighting with each other.""

The Genie looked at the map and exclaimed, ""Gadzooks,lady! These countries have been at war for thousands of years. I'm good but not THAT good! I don't think it can be done. Make another wish.""

The woman thought for a minute and said, ""Well, I've never been able to find the right man. You know, one that's considerate and fun, likes to cook and helps with the housecleaning, is good in bed and gets along with my family, doesn't watch sports all the time,and is faithful. That's what I wish for, a good mate.""

The Genie let out a long sigh and said,""Let me see that fucking map!""



A guy goes over to his friend's house, rings the bell, and the wife answers. ""Hi, is Boris home?"" asked Ned. ""No, he went to the store."" replied the wife. 

""Well, you mind if I wait?"" asked Ned. ""No, come in."" responded the wife. 

They sit down and the friend says, ""You know Sue, you have the greatest breasts I have ever seen. I'd give you a hundred bucks if I could just see one."" Sue thinks about this for a second and figures what the hell - a hundred bucks. She opens her robe and shows one. He promptly thanks her and throws a hundred bucks on the table. 

They sit there a while longer and Ned says, ""They are so beautiful. I've got to see the both of them. I'll give you another hundred bucks if I could just see the both of them together."" Sue thinks about this and thinks what the hell, opens her robe, and gives Ned a nice long look. Ned thanks her, throws another hundred bucks on the table, and then says he can't wait any longer and leaves. 

A while later Boris arrives home and his wife says, ""You know, your weird friend Ned came over."" Boris thinks about this for a second and says, ""Well did he drop off the $200 he owes me?"" -- hahaha

Q. What did the bra say to the hat? 
A. ""YOU GO ON AHEAD AND I'LL HOLD 'EM HERE!"""

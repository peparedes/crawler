"event","so i decided to start a journal for our band, The Letter Red, i think it might be fun to document everything that is going on with the band through a journal. Whenever i get a band going i always get antsy and excited for things so i go crazy and make sites, journals etc. It doesnt really matter how many people read this, this is mostly for the band, and if anyone wants to keep up with what's going on in our lives right now. Also we don't have a site right now, so our only way of updating people is through myspace and now live journal.

NEWS

site news-hopefully we will have a site up in the next two weeks, we are currently figuring out designs and stuff, and figuring out who is going to make the site and whether or not we want to pay for our own URL or not..so plan on a letter red site coming in late december/early january.

show news-
friday december 17-Altadena house show w/ Mordecai, Strategeme and Normandie
tuesday december 21-TBA
monday december 27-date subject to change but itd be at Danes house w/ South Bend Shovel Slayer, Mordecai, Trial by Fire and Normandie
friday january 21-Mosaic Cafe w/Confide, Indefinite Beauty

recording news-we will probably go into the studio once we have about 6 or 7 songs and then from there we will choose our favorite 3 or 4 to record. We currently have 4 songs and will be working on our 5th today, so we probably wont be recording until january or febuary.

IF ANYONE HAS OR KNOWS ANYONE WHO HAS A HOUSE THAT WE COULD SET UP A SHOW AT PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP!!! THANK YOU YOU WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED :)

"event","YAY!!! That's really all I can say to express how happy I am right now.  Yes guys, it's true.  Amie Whetzel of all people has been nominated for Homecoming Queen and now she is 1 of 5 canidates in the exciting race to the top.  HA!  This is all I wanted.  I don't care if I win...I'm pretty sure I won't.  But I've always been a humble person and I don't hold very much confidence in myself, which isn't good and I don't know why I'm like this.  Anyway, kids of Phoebus...vote for me if you please.  Hopefully the people who don't like me at good ole Phoebus won't sabotage my campaign materials.  If only people could realize that they don't need to hate me over stupid things.  BUt hey! Whatever.

I fall before you, here I am.
I have nothing left, thought I've tried to forget.
You're all that I am, take me home.
I'm through fighting it.
Broken.
Lifeless.
I give up.
You're my only strength.
Without you I can't go on anymore...ever again.

My only hope (all the time I've tried)
My only peace (to walk away from you)
My only joy 
My only strengh (I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life (and love is where I am)
My only L~O~V~E

I can't run anymore, I give myself to you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
In all my bitterness I ignored all that's real and true.
All I need is Y~O~U.
When night falls on me I'll not close my eyes.
I'm too alive and you're too strong.
I can't lie anymore, I fall down before you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Constantly ignoring the pain consuming me.
But this time it's cut too deep.
I'll never stray again."

"event","I got my senior pics today.  They turned out GREAT!  A lot better than I thought they would.  For once, I finally took awesome pictures.  Now I gotta save up some money to pay for them.
Samm bought me a fish today.  He's a bubble-eye fish, or something like that. Basically he's a gold fish with bubbles coming from his eyes... very weird looking.  His name is Bodie Knox Ville.  No relation to old Johnny, even though he kinda resembles the goldfish Johnny threw up...GROSS!  I love my Bodie.  I think it's a girl...my mom says she's pregnant..LOL! 
So after getting the fish I took Samm to dinner and then we went to Sandy Bottom and went paddle-boating.  Like I said, we're RANDOM!  Ok time to go now.  Gotta go to work in the morning.  
   Love Me Most,
      Amie"

"event","So today was the BIG day...senior pictures!!! Woohoo was it fun...sarcasm.  I took 20 poses and I hope at least 1 comes out right.  I hate taking pictures, especially after what happened last year.  I wish that picture never exsisted.  Anyway, Samm and Rachel were there so that made it fun.  But I really started to get bored after the first half of pics.  Well, that's it for my exciting day.  All I want to do now is go to sleep.

"event","So Gloucester was fun.  Samm is NOT allowed to have children...she couldn't handle it.  She really is fucking crazy.  I on the other hand am very good with children, so if oyu ever need a baby-sitter call me!  Anyway, we played 2 hours of hide-and-go-seek... that was just too much fun. (Can you sense the sarcasm)?  Ok to be o honest it was fun, but only because we were playing with 5 little kids who were afraid of the dark and kept crying for their mommas...hahaha.  I'm evil.  Kinda hurt myself tryin to get in and outta the closet.  Anyway, we finally got the kids to sleep around 10.  
    Then... Ouch *tears* it's coming outta my nose and my ears!!  
    My ears hurt *more tears*.  Oh God, my head...I need to lay   
    down.   
Make that out to mean whatever you want...only Samm knows the truth.  Anyway, we were stuck watching a weird ass movie called Spun, that I am defiantely gonna have to rent.  Can we say ""nudity?""  HEHEHE!!! But the reason it was so weird was because there was no volume...the volume button got hit when the kids decided to hide behind the TV.  real smart, right?  That problem didn't get fixed until today after we left.  
Samm bought me lunch today at Sonic.  It was pretty good, I just wish I hadn't eaten so much.  It's her fault though...""Amie, get whatever you want...""  I take that as ""Amie, order everything off the menu""  And now I feel like that's what I did.  And I ate it all!!! 
Danielle called me earlier.  She still wants me to move to Texas to live with her.  Seems like a good idea now.
  Now I'm talkin to Nokomis, which makes me happy.  Hopefully it'll end up being a good conversation.  I should go to bed soon.

Night Night,
Amie"

"event","WooHoo!!!  Looks like I'm goin' to Gloucester with Samm tonight to baby-sit.  It's my payback to her for saving me yesterday.  I was supposed to go to the movies with Nokomis, but Mom said no.  Anyway, Nicole called me today.  She really needs to ocme home soon... I miss her a lot.  I don't like being separated from my little sister for so long.  She'll be home in about 2 weeks though.  I'm so excited.  Anyway, I guess I go back to work on Monday.  i don't think that'll be too much fun since I have this thing pertruding from my belly-button...LOL!  I'm supposed to learn some new things when I go back though.  No more base-boards, PLEASE!  Well it's time for me to go now.

"event","Well yesterday I was rescued from Nags Head by my mother and her friend.  Thank GOD!!! I think it might have been the worst vacation ever.  But maybe that's because I was the only female, besides my grandma, but she's cool so that was ok.  I finally got my naval pierced.  And yes, I did scream like a little bitch.  But hey, it hurt, and when something hurts I scream.  It was funny though because all the cute guys that work there were yallin' at me to shut up.  I think the only reason I went through with it was because the piercer guy was hot.  His name was Jacob.  The only reason I know that is because he put it on my ""care"" sheet for my naval.  I went shopping on Tuesday... bought some clothes and stuff.  I'm so happy to be home though.  Even though there still is some stuff goin on that I would love to avoid.  I got to spend some  time with Samm today.  We went shopping.  I was tryin to find something to wear for senior pics, but I couldn;t find anything.  I hate taking pics because I know they're gonna turn out crappy.  I'm stressin so much over them too.  My dad's comin home from Nags Head tomorrow.  I'm mad they went out for hamburgers tonight... I bet if I was still there that wouldn't have happened.  Look at me complaining AGAIN!!  Oh well.  Anyway, I guess that's enough for now...lalalalalalalalala!
My naval burns...

I think the most depressing movie I've ever seen (that actually brought tears to my eyes) was ""The Notebook.""  A friend from Girls State told me I should go see it, so I did, and it ended up being a greta movie but it was so sad.  Then there's this other movie that I just got done watching called ""Pay It Forward.""  It made me sad, but no tears came.  Thank God, cuz I made a ""bet"" with someone who swore it would make me cry.  HA! You were wrong.  It takes a real good sad movie to make this girl cry.  Anyway, yeah, I'm done for tonight.

"event","This week has been full of mistakes.  I'm so confused.  I think I've done the right thing because I've done it for myself, but I feel so bad because I know I've hurt someone that I care very much for and that also cares a lot for me.  Life is confusing and I can't seem to express my feelings fully.  I'm scared that I may NEVER grow up.  In a couple of months I'll be 18 and I really don't think I'm ready for the responsibility that comes along with it.  My mom stills treats me like a child and that is holding me back from becoming the young adult that I should be.  I guess that's the main reason I had to do what I did.  I need to be on my own and make my own decisions.  It's time for me to take control of MY life.  And I can't handle the responsibility of caring for someone so much right now... but there's no way I can stop caring.  I just want to run away from my problems.  I want to let go of almost everyone I know.  I want to start over.  But that's just not possible right now.  I am pretty sure I'm not the only one that feels like this...

  Anyway, the trip to Nags Head is coming up on Saturday.  All the family will be here tomorrow... I'm so happy (I hope you can sense the sarcasm).  I really hope Rainey is going with me, but I can't get a hold of her.  I really need someone to go with me; there's no way I'll be able to handle the week otherwise.  I plan on going hang-gliding...maybe that'll help prepare me for skydiving.  I doubt it, LOL!  I guess I'm gonna get my naval pierced.  Doesn't that sound like TONS of FUN?!?!  

  Well, I've run out of things to complain and whine about.  Maybe I'll think of something else later...

"event","All of this makes me wonder... is Kestrel having a field day just watching everyone get killed by these... whatever-these-monsters-are, or are they out there slaughtering people, too?

There's nowhere near as many people around as there were before.  Not surprising.  I'd be tired of it, too, if I didn't have good enough reasons to stick around.

.... Where the hell are Atoli and Endrance?  I thought they had these devices, too."

<strike>Dammit, I just wanna find</strike>

I keep wondering if someone I actually know can even access this.  ... Don't know if that would be a good thing or a bad thing."

"event","Haven't had this thing very long, and I've already heard announcements from both groups.  ANTI and OSTA, right? <strike>That OSTA woman reminds me of someone</strike>

No wonder CC Corp didn't offer their own official announcement.  They really <i>didn't</i> know where all of this mess came from.

... It had better be fixed soon.  I have more important things to worry about.

"event",".... I hate today.

For starters, Silabus bailed on us nearly last-minute.  Where am I going to find a melee-type that's high enough in level for the Arena by Friday, especially one that's actually willing to work with the team?

Today, in English Lit., we had a pop quiz on <i>Othello</i>.  Definitely wasn't ready for that.  Hate Shakespeare.

Also, I could really go for something sweet right now, but hell if I'm going anywhere near any kind of chocolate anywhere on this campus for at least another year or two.

..... On the plus side, my roommate is back to normal.  ... Trust me, man, it's good to have you back."

Ahah, that would be awesome.  Doubt it would happen, but you know, Ryou is too common and Misaki is... .... yeah.

Hey, at least people could tell me apart from the others.  Whatever, right?

Hmm. Sever update, game is down.  ... Dammit."

"event","Some random girl in the Delta server's root town was talking about how she found out some PKer's secrets on his blog.  Figured I'd look around, or something.  Plus, everyone else at my school seems to have one, too.  Maybe it's about time I got one.

Or... something like that.

Yeah, it's me.  Ryou Misaki.  Haseo online, but whatever.  Just moved into the dormitories because my father thought it would be a good idea.  Haven't met my roommate yet.  Someone named Sunao.

Anyone out there?

((OoC:  Yeah, we're pretending he's been attending Ouran for a while, since canon confirms that he ""attends a very famous private high school in Japan"".  XD  Hope that's alright.))"

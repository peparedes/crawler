1. Erika turned 4 on the 27th October. I still can't believe it...
2. Gym going well, almost two months since I started and no weight loss yet but I've lost a couple of inches all over and fitting into a few more of my pre-pregnancy clothes. YAY Me!!!
3. Alyssa is 16 months, walking, talking and eating regular food. Luckily for me she still looks like a baby

That's all I have time for right now....."

Time has honestly gone by really fast. If I thought Erika's first year went by fast then Aly's has gone by twice as fast. I guess that's what happens when one has two kids, time just passes you by. <br /><br />Anyway I love watching my daughters grow and I know that once Aly starts walking and talking there will be no turning back, the baby stage in my home will be over forever. Erika is already acting so grown up and constantly amazes me with all the stuff she knows. <br /><br />Well kids grow up and the best thing for me to do right now is to enjoy every moment I have with them.</p>"

"event","The familiar strains of ABBA's Chiquidita drifted through the air as I entered the room with my rather late breakfast. I was about to get settled down when I was interrupted by strains of a different kind, the baby wailing kind. I set my plate down on the little pull out table and crossed over to the next room to see what the matter was. I checked the Little One's nappy but that did not need changing, I already new that she was not hungry so I figured she was probably uneasy and had another burp coming. I picked her up and paced up and down the room stroking her on the back but no burp came, the wailing however had stopped. I put her down and headed back to my waiting meal but was barely halfway across the passage when the wailing started again. 

I went back to the baby and picked her up again. As I started walking with her she stopped crying but if I tried to put her down she would start again. I thought that perhaps she was sleepy so started to rock her to sleep but she stared up at me with eyes wide open and not a hint of sleepiness. She began to smile at me. I put her back down on the bed and started to talk to her I told her how hungry I was after feeding her four times that morning on an empty stomach and how important it was that I eat now if I was to give her another feed soon. She talked back to me with delighted coos and gurgles and it seemed like the uneasiness had passed and she was comfortable again. So I kissed her on her nose and went back to my by now cold breakfast. 

A couple of forkfuls of cheese omelet later the howling started again! I set my fork down and rushed back to my darling daughter's side. I changed the wet nappy but the crying didn't stop. I picked her up and started walking and talking and that did the trick. Put her back down and she made a face but was OK so long as I stayed with her and talked to her. Only then did the reason for her sobs hit me; she simply wanted company. My breakfast was already brunch and would soon be lunch at this rate so I needed a solution now. I carried my little bundle over to her grandfather ""Dad please take her for a little while"" I said, ""I really need to eat something"". Lovingly my father took his granddaughter in his arms and before I had even left the room they had a nice little conversation going.

I finally got down to finishing my breakfast/brunch/lunch and poured myself a hot cup of tea. With cup in hand I strolled over to my dad's room to check on things. My baby was blissfully asleep in her grandpa's lap as he sat in his rocking chair rocking back and forth. It's a familiar scene one I have seen often even with my older daughter but it still makes my heart melt every time. ""Oh well"" I thought to myself with a sigh, ""I guess I'm on a break""."

"event","Well Diana Paradise completed 5yrs on the 13th of this month and although I remembered I was too busy to post about it. Belated Happy Birthday Old Girl...

While going through my entries I realised how things have changed over time and how I have changed with them. So in keeping with all that has changed I also edited the title of my journal; Traveller's Thoughts, My story as I travel through space and time has been changed to: The Mommie Diaries, My story as I play mother to my two beautiful daughters. It seems right as all the travelling has taken a back seat and motherhood has become #1 priority. And yes it's true, all I post about anymore are my two little Angels, ""Sigh!"". 

So there you have it; five years down the line the young lady who went on frequent camping trips, visited Bangalore and Pune every now and then, back packed up North and spent 2005 doing quite a bit of international travel has hung up the travel boots and now responds to mummy/mamma.

As most of you might have guessed just a few days after that post my Baby came along. Yes, I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl on the 7th July at 8.53am. She weighed 7 pounds and had a head full of jet black curls. Her name is Alyssa.<br /><br />I had to undergo a C-section which was half expected as I has one for Erika too but all went off well. In fact it all happened almost exactly the same way as it did the first time round. My little one had to spend 48 hours in NICU because she passed and swallowed her stools while still in the womb and also developed mild jaundice. They brought her to me on the third day and she has been doing great ever since.<br /><br />Well it's been one month now and I am happy to report that Alyssa has gained a good amount of weight, feeds well and does not keep me up nights. Erika is thrilled to bits over her new baby sister and loves her like crazy. She is the perfect big sister and is very protective of Alyssa.<br /><br />So there's my big news; I am now the proud mother of two gorgeous little girls and I could not be happier:o)</p>"

"event","Still pregnant. The Baby seems quite content to stay where he/she is. I'm five days from my due date and never thought I would make it this far. Of course I am happy that from now on no matter when the Baby comes he/she will be good and ready. No preemie for me:o) Only problem is that because of my prior C-section the Doc is not too happy about me going all the way to my due date let alone beyond it. If I don't go into labour naturally within the next three days or so she will have to consider planning another c-section as inducing labour is not an option for me. 

The false alarms come and go and leave me disappointed just as I start getting my hopes up. Well I am ready, the Baby is full term the only question left now is ""When?"". I am hoping for a normal this time and so far things are looking good so I'm keeping optimistic. All of you out there say a little prayer for me that all goes well and that my next update is all about my new Bundle of Joy.

"event","Less than four weeks to go and I am getting so fed up with this being pregnant business. Yes it is true that the baby could be out any day now but for his/her own sake and safety I hope it doesn't happen for another couple of weeks at least. There is no respite from the heat and humidity and that makes things even worse. Everyday I wish for rain and everyday it is bright and sunny and hot, hot, hot...... Of course there is always the chance that the day I go into labour it'll be pouring buckets.

Erika starts school tomorrow and she is really looking forward to it. She enjoyed her first year at the the play school and is very happy to be going back for a second year. I have enrolled her for a four hour batch this time and am looking forward to sometime to myself during which I plan to lay in bed and do absolutely nothing. 

Dad is back from visiting <LJ user=""bluesmoon""/> in the US so I am no longer stressed about what to do about Erika, the dog and the house if I went into labour a couple of weeks early. The maid has also been with us for over a year now and is familiar with Erika's morning routine and will be able to take over when I am in the hospital.

It is getting harder to sleep so I am updating my journal at 1.30am. My appetite is down because of the heat so I actually lost 3 & 1/2kgs between visits to the doc. I am not complaining, so much less to lose after the baby is born. Of course I am being careful about getting all my required nutrients for the health of the little one.

Right now I am dealing with hot flashes, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braxton_Hicks_contractions"">Braxton Hicks contractions</a>, shooting pain in my lower abdomen every time I stand up, some amount of breathlessness and dizziness and backaches..... The Joys of Motherhood.

Wish me luck."

I went to the Globus (Bandra) sale yesterday. After going through the stuff for a while I was not surprised that there was a sale on. With racks and racks of crap it was no wonder they were trying to sell off the stuff at half rate. There was just so much bad design, awful colour combination and down right poor quality..... Yes there were one or two half decent clothing items but they were only available in two sizes; small and 'help I'm starving to death'. Not a very productive afternoon. <LJ user=""rocknromuald""/> did get me a pair of sun glasses (not from Globus) to replace my pair that broke and that was his Valentine's gift to me. 

It was rather sweet to see so many guys in the ladies' section of the store though picking out tops, costume jewelry and bags for their lady loves. More than once I over heard some anxious guy ask a sales person if the item could be exchanged if required. Perhaps they were the ones buying all those small and X-small clothes to flatter their girl friends.....

Well love is in the air and I'm off to tend to the person I love the most in the whole world. Yes it is Erika's lunch time:o)"

"event","The fifth month has begun, almost halfway now..... Have started feeling the baby move, it is very reassuring. My back hurts like crazy and having to lift my 13kg two year old every now and then does not help but can not be helped. It is getting harder and harder to find a comfortable sleeping position. 

Took Erika for a b'day party last Saturday, had to travel by 2nd class in a Borivali local at peak time to get to our destination. Anyone who lives in Bombay will understand when I say I went to hell and back. The party was great fun but I decided to come home by auto rickshaw after and was almost Rs.200/- poorer after the ride. The little one developed tonsillitis a couple of days ago and is now under treatment, she has not had fever for two days now. One of the first things the pediatrician asked me was if we had attended any birthday parties recently, I said yes, then he asked if Erika had had and soft drinks (Pepsi, Fanta, etc) I said yes. Well that was the cause...

Lots of my friends are having babies (mostly girls) and they are all calling me up for advice, tips and reassurances. I am quite enjoying it. I got through those tricky first few months with Erika mostly on my own, with trial and error and figuring things out on my own and if that new found wisdom can help others so be it. 

Went to the market today and bought fresh fish. Dal, rice, fried fish and pickle is honestly one of the best meals I've ever had. Also got some lovely broccoli which we had plain boiled. I am happy to say that my daughter has gone past her phase of not eating well and has got back her normal healthy appetite. 

I'm taking each day as it comes....."

"event","I'm pregnant. Yes baby #2 is on the way and due around 11th July. The first trimester went off smoothly and I am already a couple of weeks into my second trimester and everything seems to be going well. I have hardly any morning sickness which is a huge improvement since last time and with Erika around I am so busy and preoccupied that I have no time to obsess over this pregnancy. Overall things are much better this time round. It was no surprise finding out we were pregnant because it was planned. If at all we were a tad surprised that things happened so quickly.

Erika now knows that there is a small baby in mummy's tummy, whether or not that makes any sense to her I do not know. I am sure she will make a wonderful big sister because I have seen her around other children and she is very gentle. Also she is of a peaceful temperament and gets along well with anybody. 

I have started to show relatively early this time but it's ok coz I already have sufficient maternity wear. The lack of morning sickness has caused some weight gain but I am managing to keep it under control for now. Eventually putting on up to 10 - 15 kilos will be a normal part of the pregnancy. Have done the first couple of tests and all is going well. Baby showed a good amount of movement and a strong heartbeat during the first USG scan. 

I had a blast this past Christmas season because I know that come July and my life is going to change forever. What with two kids it will be a while before I get some decent time to myself. Luckily with <LJ user=""rocknromuald""/>, dad and a full time maid around I have enough of help. 

I am happy, I am excited but most of all I am done making babies......  

Any guesses on whether it is a boy or a girl?"

"event","I love waking up every morning, walking into my living room and seeing all my Christmas decoration up. The tree in one corner, the wreath on the door, the Crib in it's special place and a little something on every wall to spread the Christmas cheer. The day itself passed all too quickly but the Christmas spirit is still here......<br /><br />Hello there all of you on LJ, I'm still around. I have not posted for over a month and did not even get down to sending out my Christmas wishes but it has been a crazy past few weeks with no time to even breathe. As I vowed not to end the year without a blog post here I am. <br /><br />I hope you all had a Happy Christmas, spending time with family and loved ones and enjoying great food. I know I did. Christmas was peaceful with mass at 10.00am on the 24th night followed by a small get together at a friend's terrace. Christmas lunch was with family with the traditional roast chicken and pork vindaloo. Awesome! On the 25th evening we were invited to a bar-be-que party at another friend's house but  <lj user=""rocknromuald""> was not feeling too well so I went on my own for a short while and came back relatively early. The next two days were practically a blur...<br /><br />On the 27th December was my school reunion, the culprit that has kept me so busy this past month. We formed our school alumni in July this year and I joined the core committee. Our very first event was to be a 'Grand Reunion' of all the batches (since 1953). As we got closer to the date we were all running around like headless chickens making sure everything was in place and tying up all the loose ends. We originally <i>hoped</i> to have a crowd of 350 plus another 20 complimentary invitees and so printed 400 tickets. Three days before the event we were completely sold out and the number of requests for more tickets prompted us to print a 100 more which got sold out in 24 hours and still people wanted tickets. We finally closed sales when our number hit 600 and our caterer threatened to pull out! The best part of it all was that the reunion was exclusively for ex-students and spouses/boyfriends were not invited. Yes it was a girls only night and we were sold out. <br /><br />The day dawned and the committee members were in the school grounds nearly the whole day getting the lights, tables/chairs, stage and backdrop, sound, etc organised. And finally the evening came, we had given ourselves enough time to go home, get dolled up and be back before our guests arrived. They started to arrive first in a trickle and then in crowds. Emotions ran high as girls of all ages broke down in tears when entering the gates of their Alma Mater some after as long as 40 years. Grey haired ladies still young at heart were throwing their arms around each other in tight hugs and screaming like school girls on seeing their long lost classmates after a lifetime and the atmosphere was absolutely electric. <br /><br />As part of the organising committee and someone responsible for getting the event together it was very heartening for me to see the joy we had brought to these ladies. I am happy to say that the evening was a huge success albeit with a few glitches here and there. We even had a sort circuit which caused a minor fire but thanks to our caterer who had the presence of mind not to panic and douse the flames with sand the disaster went virtually unnoticed. Our short entertainment bit was a hit, everyone enjoyed the dinner and compliments were freely flowing. All in all a very memorable day. Needless to say I was flat out for the major part of the next day.<br /><br />2008 has been a rather good year for me except of course for the terror attacks on my beloved city and I pray that 2009 will usher in an era of peace. <br /><br /><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><em>Wishing You All a Very Happy 2009!!!<br /></em></span></strong></span><strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-size: larger;""><em><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Peace.....</span></span><br /></em></span></span></strong><br />"

"event","A few days ago I decided to bake bread. I had seen a recipe for pizza base in a magazine and it looked pretty simple so I decided to modify it where necessary and make regular bread. I went through a couple of bread recipes online and was a bit undecided on which method to follow so decided to ask the bread expert himself; My Dad.

He gave me a few points and I decided to get started right away as I had all the ingredients. I also dragged my poor dad into the kitchen with me to guide me with every step. First I activated the yeast in warm water and once the water got nice and frothy I started kneading the dough with a bit of salt and sugar. I used whole wheat flour and once I got a nice dough I added oats and oregano for added fiber and flavour. 

I let the dough stand for two hours and once it had risen to twice its size I formed it into bagels (just for fun) and let it rise for another hour. I brushed on some oil, sprinkled sesame seeds on and popped the tray into the preheated oven. Half and hour later my whole wheat, oatmeal, oregano bagels were ready. They were not as soft and light as I hoped they would be but dad said that using whole wheat flour needs a little practice. Anyway they tasted pretty good so not bad at all for my first time.

Erika is over at the neighbour's playing with their little one and <LJ user=""rocknromuald""> is not home from work yet. There is nothing good on TV and I'm not in the mood for reading because I know that I'll barely get comfortable with a book and I'll have to get up to do something else. It's too late in the evening to experiment with something new for dinner and I've already planned Erika's wardrobe for school for the next three days.....

The original plan for this evening was for me and the other mums from the park to take our little ones to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mary_Church,_Bandra"">Bandra Fair</a> but the rain changed that. I did take Erika to the fair yesterday and it was quite nice. She is old enough now to sit on some if the merry-go-round rides and enjoyed herself on the one with little cars for the kids to sit in. Back when I was a kid we had those lovely galloping horses which would go up and down as they went around and people of all ages could sit on them. Unfortunately they don't have them anymore so I could not take Erika on that ride as I had hoped.  

Back to this evening and it is a complete wash out. Oh well, I'm done with my green tea and the hubby called to say he'll be working late. I think I'll go get Erika and let her keep me company. There is never a dull moment with my soon to be two year old around....."

I asked the salesman how much and he said 35 rupees. I had to have that mug so I bought it. This was one of my few impulse buys but I am really glad I went ahead with it.

The other day we decided that she has outgrown her baby cot and so without much delay we packed it up, put it in storage (for when we have our second) and replaced it with a folding mattress. Erika does not have her own room yet but in the process of getting her used to sleeping in a big bed we decided on the 6x3ft. mattress which is kept directly on the floor which eliminates the chance of her falling off. During the day the mattress folds up neatly and is stacked in a corner. All of a sudden our bedroom looks so much bigger and I have to say it takes a little getting used to. My little one is also almost completely potty trained and I hope that by her 2nd birthday at the end of next month she will be completely off diapers.

And on a final note last week when Erika was 1 year, 10 months and a few days we finally ran out of our supply of baby powder that we received as gifts when she was born. The other day for the very first time since my baby's birth I had to actually go out and buy powder for her. I'm taking this as a sign that it will soon be time to stop using baby powder as well.

I also got to spend some good quality time with my cousin who was down from Canada and whom I meet once a year if I am lucky, I caught up with my other Pune cousins and I bought Erika a really cute pair of imitation Crocs which she absolutely loves and wont go anywhere without. I woke up late nearly everyday, lazed at home and went out only when we were in the mood and the weather was good. We spent one day at my uncle's beautiful country house and I also ate like crazy and put on three kilos that I could honestly do without. I was really glad for the break but it's good to be home again. It's back to the usual now except for a stiff neck which is taking it's own sweet time to go. I hope to get back to swimming as soon as possible and get back in shape.

Since school starts at 9.00am I am forced to wake up at 7.00am myself and start my day early, some days it works some days it doesn't. 

<LJ user=""rocknromuald""/> and I went to see 'Hancock' last week, I loved the movie. Saw 'Air Buddies' at home today. I had actually brought it for Erika to watch but she was happy with watching bits here and there. It was a very sweet movie though.

The travel bug has bitten and so next week Erika and I are off to Pune to spend some time with my cousin who is down from Canada. I am really looking forward to this trip. 

As many of my fellow LJers may already know I finally signed up for Facebook. I am proud to say that I am not addicted.  

I managed to go swimming twice last week and by swimming I mean serious laps. The only problem is that there is no pool near home that I can access and so have to go two suburbs away to the gymkhana where my cousin is a member to use the pool. If I can manage to swim three times a week for an hour each time it should be worth it. I am not as out of practice as I thought I was and am building up my stamina pretty fast. 

Also been busy with my freelance environmental awareness work and am glad to have something to keep the gray cells active. I work with a small <a href=""http://www.oasisngo.org/"">NGO</a> and I design awareness projects for schools.

Enough happening in life to keep it interesting......"

I know I should be heartbroken and I was when I first heard the news this morning but my dad says we can replant it. The tree is still whole and has been uprooted completely which means it will continue to grow when planted firmly back in the ground. Dad's positive attitude and determination fills me with hope for lots more yummy masala fried breadfruit (which is actually a vegetable).<br /><br />More updates on the tree when they happen.</p>

PS: <LJ user=""bluesmoon""/>'s car was parked elsewhere and is safe....

Update: Unfortunately the tap root has broken and the tree can not be replanted but we still hope that a new sapling will grow from the root."

"event","I'm glad to say that music won out and I am now the proud owner of <a href=""http://www.umusicindia.com/album.php?albumid=511&hotcom=2&category=2/"">2008's Top 20</a> and <a href=""http://www.umusicindia.com/album.php?albumid=518&hotcom=2&category=2/"">Hip Hop Party 2008</a>. Finally the likes of Rihanna, Akon, Timbaland and the Pussycat Dolls can be heard from the speakers of my modest mini hifi system. I was getting a little fed up with only having Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion to listen to no matter how great an album it is. But now it's party time...

In other news the hubby was up very early this morning and asked me if I wanted to try the breakfast buffet at this little place called Open Affair. I was still half asleep and I said we'd see once I woke up. Three hours later we did make it for breakfast and it was very good. We had eggs, sausages, baked beans, chicken sandwiches, pineapple pancakes, French toast, aloo parathas, spinach parathas, watermelon juice and I had tea and <LJ user=""rocknromuald""/> had coffee. Think it came to about Rs.170/- a head and was totally worth it. We've also been to Open Affair for dinner a couple of times and will swear by their chicken malai kebabs, they are honestly the best we've ever tasted. If you ever find yourself on Bandra, Carter Road take the turn off at the Cafe Coffee Day outlet on the road that leads to Pali Hill and look out on your right for Open Affair. There are a number of little restaurants on this street but this one is not hard to spot.      

My one year, seven month old Erika is due to start play school in about 10 days time and I am rather excited about having some free time to myself every morning for at least and hour and a half. Of course I've got to find something to do with my time or I'll be bored to death. My Baby really knows how to keep me occupied the whole day and sometimes half the night but that is what motherhood is about and I'm loving it. The only reason I can sit and type this entry right now is because she is at the neighbour's house playing with their little baby. OK break time is over, it's lunch time and I have to go get my Bundle of Joy........"

"event","One of the hardest decisions I have to make everyday is what to make for lunch. I do not know why it is so hard to decide but every now and then I run out of ideas. Anyway so here's the thing I'm asking for suggestions. In our household we eat all veggies, chicken and fish, we also eat all red meats but not often for health reasons. Now it would be absolutely great if you all could throw in menu suggestions so that I can make a chart with 3-4 option per day. Sundays are taken care of with biryanis, Chinese or continental food. 

I don't need recipes just ideas so please keep them coming. Thanks!"

"event","But I still don't post on LJ. Actually a lot of the time when there is something to write about I never get down to it and then too much time passes. A recap follows:

Just before my baby girl's 1st birthday in October last year I took her on a holiday to Mangalore and Bangalore, just the two of us. It was a great holiday but I never wrote about it. The 27th December 2007 was an interesting date for me, it was the day that Erika completed one year and two months and the hubby and I had been married for two years and one month, never blogged about that either but it will go down in history as the day Benazir Bhutto was assassinated/died. On the 25th of February was my hubby's birthday, the intention was there to wish him on LJ but again I never did, my thanks to my brother <LJ user=""bluesmoon""> for taking care of that. And finally my baby girl is constantly giving me stuff to blog about, she is developing so fast, walks, runs, is picking up words at an amazing rate and does the funniest things sometimes but although her mama is really proud of her she never tells the world about it.

Well of late I realised how boring Diana Paradise had become even though real life isn't so I decided to give and update. While my life at the moment is centered around motherhood I do a bit of freelance work with an NGO involved in environmental awareness with school students. I have a nice little clique of other mums who come to the park with their babies and we do a lot of lunches and other activities together. And last November I took my cousin who was visiting for a ladies night out and got hit on by a cute guy. So that is how my life has been over the past few months and although I don't travel and party as much as before and I don't go camping and trekking at all there is enough going on to keep me busy and keep my from getting bored. On a closing note; 'Long Live my LJ Friends' who keep me entertained when there is nothing else to do."

"event","My passport is due to expire in a couple of months so the time has come to get it renewed. The last time round this was no big deal and I did not give the previous boring passport a second look but this time it breaks my heart to let my passport go. I went through is again and with a satisfied yet rueful sigh I counted the visa stamps: Qatar, UK, Schengen States, Sweden and Malaysia. All the stamps were from 2005 the year that made me a world traveler. The other big change which does not really bother me is my name on the passport, I will be dropping my middle names which I never really cared for and adding my married surname after my maiden surname. I'm hoping I have a better passport picture this time and yes I hope that this passport too will be my companion on many a world trip. Wish me luck....."

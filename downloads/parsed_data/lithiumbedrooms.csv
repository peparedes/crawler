"event","Well, I am really trying to move out by December. Diana is going off to Nicaragua for a vacation. She will be out of the country for my birthday but she really wasnt here for my last one either, just in person. She never acknowledged my birthday present in March and never said anything when our 12 year anniversary came and went. She never said anything when I gave her a dozen roses in September twice. I think she may be trying to tell me something. 
I am past that though. Yeah, I still feel dejected and hurt, and its not the future I wanted when I look, but that is life. Its a challenge and afterall I am up for a good challenge.
That rules out suicide however attractive that is at times. It rules out murder. I guess. Anyway, I am transforming into a better person, so on most days I just try to be nice and treat everyone with respect. This is an end. I feel bad most days because I haven't had that new beginning yet. Maybe in January. Maybe not.
I have sworn off women for a while although I could use some female friends. My male friends have all come thru for me though and I survive with their support and humor. My family has been wonderful and my kids have been warm and loving.
I could ask for more but this is a life full of blessings. I count them everyday to offset the hell that surrounds me.

"event","New Orleans will disappear tonight. Here in the northwest corner of Florida, we have been banned from the beaches. The waves are 15 feet high. You can't get away from what this storm, Katrina, will do to us all on the gulf coast. Hope we don't lose power. I will post pictures next week of the aftermath. Maybe we won't get it as bad as Mobile or Biloxi. New Orleans will disappear tonight.

"event","Intimate and amateur
pale out in the sun
infinite and lonely now
afraid I'm not the one

Silently you move yourself
to the other side of the bed
quiet now, I'll hear you cry
convinced your not in love

If I'm here another day
I promise you my only heart
conversations in the park
dinner parties with all our friends

And in the end when deep in sleep
I'll dream of you always with me

"event","remember me, its alright
I'm not the day, I'm not your night
you used to love me
now you just have me

suddenly, the sky is not blue
I lost you and I can't breathe
you used to love me
now you just lost me

nothing matters in the end
if you walk away from me
hope you notice when you live
without me there by your side"

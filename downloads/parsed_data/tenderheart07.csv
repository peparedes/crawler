"event","Screaming Infidelities..

I'm missing your bed, I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
& this bottle of beast is taking me home.
I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets
You're not alone & you're not discreet.
You make sure I know, who's taking you home.
I'm reading your note over again.
There is not a word that I comprehend,
except when you signed it 
""I will love you always & forever""

As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs,
and sit alone and wonder,
how you're making out,
but as for me I wish that I was anywhere
with anyone making out

I'm missing your laugh, how did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as your pretending.
I'm missing you bed, I never sleep.
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to sleep.
And this bottle of beast is taking me home.

Your hair.
It's everywhere.
Screaming infidelities.
Taking it's wear.

The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most..

Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself, 
and covered with a perfect shell, 
such a charming beautiful exterior.

This is one time
that you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all. 
And the grave that you refuse to leave 
the refuge that you've built to flee
the places you have come to fear the most. 

Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself, 
and hidden in the public eye. 
Such a stellar monument to loneliness. 
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes 
and perfect makeup but you're barely scraping by."

"event","When I had about 60 days clean, my sponsor gave me the key to a meeting and said it would be my job to make sure it was open on time, the coffe was ready 15 minutes before the meeting started, and there were plenty of ashtrays out (it was a longgggg time ago). I've been involved in service work in one form or another ever since. Lately though, I've found service work at area, region, and with special functions, to be very frustrating. After a lot of thought, I've come to the opinion that service work is not so much about accomplishing any specific task, as much as giving us recovering addicts some experience in working with each other and getting through conflicts in a healthy way. Problem for me is, I think I've pretty much learned my lesson on these topics, and I no longer have any desire to do the traditional service work commitments. So what do I do now?

I have always hated speaking. I commented to my sponsor a couple of years ago that I thought it was pretty egotistical for people to send in tapes or CDs to be considered as speakers at a function when tapes and CDs hadn't been asked for. He made an interesting, and now I believe a very true comment. He said, ""If people with good recovery don't send their stuff in and aren't willing to share, it will be just the ego maniacs at our functions.""

So..... my new commitment to service work is to be willing and even interested in speaking at functions anytime I am asked. 

Anyone out there have a function coming up and want an old fart with 28 years clean as a speaker? <G>"

"event","Hey all,

I've tried to send out text messages on this but have had some difficulties with messages not going through. Saturday is graduation (9:00 AM) and if you have some strange desire to torture yourself with that, you're more than welcome to attend. Pixie and Alison will be there, as will my sponsor and his wife, Bob & Nancy. Even if you don't come to the ceremony though, I hope you can join us at Amerigoes in Jackson for a celebratory dinner. We plan on getting there about 1:00 PM. Let me know if you're coming and I'll be sure to save you a seat."

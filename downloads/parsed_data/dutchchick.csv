"event","I write the best pieces when I write them for the first time. That is because they come straight from the heart. As soon as I get a comment and I have to rewrite it, it immediately feels like it's not mine anymore. These are not my thoughts, not my style and not my words.

Just like this thing with my Letter of Motivation. Overall I had every topic covered, but it was still too general, I had to focus more on why I wanted to go to that University in particular. It sounded too much like I didn't care where in the US I was. And to be honest.....I DON'T! I just want to explore new place, meet new people, discover new opportunities in life and go on an adventure. That's it. Plain and simple. 

So, I went home. Decided to shut the hell up, and for once take someone else's advice. After all, it's ME that wants to go on exchange, what the hell do they care if I get in or not. They've already got 26,000 students there.

After 3 days of rewriting, the living room was a mess. There were maps of the US, books, dictionaries and articles all over the place. You could hardly move without pushing something over 9 feet in every direction from the computer. 

This morning I left the house with four different versions. As I sat in the train looking through all four of them, while making notes on the back for more improvements, I noticed this old man staring at me. I could see in his eyes that he was thinking: "" Jesus, what the hell is she doing?"" That's when I knew that this was not the right way to do it. You can't just add and change and expect it to be better.

I forgot the essence. I forgot what it was all about. I was focusing too much on the wrong things.
Taking a time out and knowing what you REALLY want is what you have to begin with.
I want to go on exchange and I know why.

That was when I put away all the papers, took out my discman, pressed play and listened to the music with my eyes closed, without letting one single thought enter my mind.

We live in a world where that constant stream of information never stops, where we are expected to keep up and never lose track. But you NEED to take a time out every once in a while, so that you can put together all the pieces of the puzzle that you've collected over the time. 

Today is that day for me, I took a time-out in the train, and I can already feel that it helps.
You can make things as easy or as difficult as you want to."

"event","Yesterday, we went to the International Film Festival, called 'Film by the Sea'. 
While sitting in public transport, we discused which films we wanted to see. Coffee & Cigarettes, Pleasant Days, Kontroll, Cool.....

When we got to the theater we decided to go for Coffee & Cigarettes first, a film by Jim Jarmusch. 

Coffee & Cigarettes is a serie of 10 short vignettes, in which the characters discuss/deal with coffee and cigarettes in the most various ways.
Jim started with the first short vignette in 1986 and finished the last in 2003. It's got a great cast. Steve Buscemi, Bill Murray, Iggy Pop, Cate Blanchett, Meg & Jack White from The White Stripes, Alfred Molina, Steve Coogan, GZA & RZA (Wu Tang Clan).....who else..... What's even better, is that they play themselves. Bill Murray is still Bill Murray, but in his short vignette he's in hiding, he pours coffee in a diner and uses ovencleaner tho get rid of this nasty cough.
Oh, you know what. You just have to see it for yourself. 

After Cofee & Cigarettes we went downstairs again, to see if we could get into another film. But since C&C had a delay, it overlapped all the other films, and there was nothing left for the rest of the evening. That's when we went to the pier, to listen to this band they had announced at the beginning of the film. Luckily for them it was a big band, cause otherwise it would have been awfully quiet around there. I guess everybody got a bit tired, and settled for the drinks and live music in 'Hollywood' on the boulevard.

So, we got on the next tram and went to The Hague. The drinks and the too-loud-but-funky-music at 'De Haagsche Lounge' were a great opportunity to discuss the film and many others and to end the evening. 

Next stop: International Film Festival Utrecht, next month."

"event","I was expecting an easy evening, you know, listening to some music, maybe watch a movie, candlelight & a facial mask.
I was ready to go back to the bathroom and wask off the mask, when someone shouted upstairs that Angela was on the phone.
""Fuck! K, hold on, I'll get it.""
I picked up the horn in the next room and tried to talk. The mask was terrible, I could hardly open my mouth.

""Margit! Margit! Alex, that DJ, called he's gonna DJ at some party tonight, and aksed us to come too. What do you think?!!!""
""Hold on, I have to...."" 
I opened my mouth a little wider, and felt the mask cracking, until I could talk a little easier.
""Well, I have to go to school tomorrow. But uhm...what party?""
""Oh, it's some company party""
""Come on over. I gotta wash off this mask.""
""OK. Oh, and it's pretty classy. Black Tie.""
""Whatever. Get your ass over here.""
""K.""

While I was washing off the mask I heard my cell phone ringing.
""Fuck! Who the hell is that?!""

""Margit, it's a private party, and we aren't actually invited. Now what?""
""Am I suppose to know a solution to this problem? Just get your ass over here, we'll just see.""
""K.""

- 45 Minutes later - 

She came rushing in, throwing here umbrella and here shit all over the place.
After I got everything together, we left my place and headed for the company.
It looked like this trip took forever, until we finally saw the company name on the side of the building. 
On our way over we thought of different scenario's, a plan A, B & C and our motives. We thought the whole thing through.

After smoking a cigarette on the parking lot we headed for the entrance and walked in. The security guy sitting at the reception looked kinda like he was thinking: ""Hmmm. Do I know these girls?""
Before he could say anything I said 'Good evening!"" and we hung up our coats as if we hadn't done it any different the last 3 years.
Looking back at the whole thing, I think he was just overwhelmed :D
So we went inside. SO BEAUTIFUL! they had created this Jungle with a glass ceiling at the back. There was a live band playing with a dancefloor. Sushi on the right, the bar on the left. And a lot of private spaces.
We looked at eachother and started to smile.
After ordering a wine and taking place in the massive couches, we started to scan the place for the DJ and the person who had organised the party.

- 2 glasses of wine later - 

""Margit, your purse is vibrating!""
Then she realized it was a phone. The DJ.
She saw him, he didn't see her. So she went over there. 
As I was finishing the last bit of wine, she almost came running back and dropped herself in the couch, making me almost choke in the wine. 
""Margit, the boss saw me! He was standing next to Alex!""
I scanned the room and saw him. Thank god he didn't saw us sitting here.

We decided to leave the couch anyway and moved over to the bar. 
It was pretty obvious that the people who had arrived at the party a little earlier, had already been consuming a lot more alcohol. Some of them kicked off their shoes and did a belly dance or crawled over a couch before a selective audience. God! :D

We ordered another drink and went back to the main entrance to have a smoke. After we had finished all that and arranged our attendance at another party somewhere in December with the DJ, we headed for the toilet.

I should have known something was wrong, as soon as the security guy came up to us. Thank god we had a perfect plan, so we could walk on.
After we entered the toilet we made sure we knew what to say.
So we checked our make-up and left again.
Fuck! The boss! 
We sticked to the plan, but unfortunately the party was only for the people working at the company.

- Outside - 

At least we broke our record...1 hour. Which is a hell of a lot better than that time we crashed that weddingparty (20 minutes) or that other companyparty last April (15 minutes).

""Margit, we CRASHED a party again!""
"":D I know! Oh, I heard there is another gala at Huis Ter Duin by the end of the month..."""

"event","I have to check that e-mail every once in a while, because I still can't believe it!!!! :D
Just as I finished my last test at the University, I went upstairs to make a certain professor understand that I was the one he has to send on exchange to the United States next year. 
Not knowing that that wasn't necessary anymore! 
As I had already opened the door, the one controlling ALL of the exchanges, walked by and asked me if I had read his last e-mail.
Not knowing what to expect, I kinda hold back and quietly said: ""Uhm, no..."" 
I swear I saw something glittering in his eyes right before he pulled me across the hall to his office and started burrying me with information.
I had no idea what this man was talking about, but I sure as hell remember this sentence: ""If you are interested, you can go on exchange to the Texas State University in the second semester."" 

WOW! You still have to ask me that? OF COURSE I WANNA GO!!!!

He printed the e-mail he sent me and handed it over proudly.
God, I was in shock. Normally, something like this never happens. EVERYBODY wants to go to the States or Canada. Especially in the second semester it's really hard, because then the English Stream gets this special treatment.
Actually....this student from the English Stream was supposed to go, but she didn't have enough credits, which made me automatically next on the list!

K, I'm gonna celebrate now!
I can't wait to go! I LOVE THE STATES! Eventhough I have already been to so many states, I have never ever been to Texas. :D

Yay! This is now officially my lucky day! ;)"

"event","Oo. I am sore from running around more than usual yesterday, and exploring the outer of centro box hill's carpark more than a person should.

i enjoy looking at this site.. revealing things from other ppl's lives. 

i wonder how long the soreness will last, why i keep coming last when laserforcing, and if the bags under my eyes will stop bothering my anytime soon."

"event","i have been invited to two 23rd birthdays this weekend, which makes me feel young. and one is harry potter themed, and i am supposed to bring harry-potter-esque item, which i don't think i can manage? :)

my engineering course has an alarming number of group assignments. never would i have imagined that i would have to talk to, let alone work with, all these people. i mean, really. but it's turned out okay so far, marks pending. and monash has accepted a number of chinese university students from a chinese uni in wu-han, to do purely materials engineering, and we're integrating with them too.. or they're trying to force us to. once again my lack of chinese speaking skills comes in handy..

must to lunch, then uni, then chadstone, to look for corrugated brown paper and doilies!"

"event","yeah, like, so.. i have realised just yesterday that i can no longer leach endlessly from others around me, and the realisation hurts like a dead bat to the eye. that, or i just need some sleep *sweeps dead bat under the rug*. 

i'll think about what more to write later.

oh, yeah! that's right. i should inform you (the ONLY person reading this) about the pretty good commonwealth games that just happened here :). not that i went to anything. and even though australia won everything. it was just fun to have it in melbourne. and about 60% of the sierra leone team (13 ppl) + 2 athletes from other countries have escaped from the games village and tried to become legitimate refugees here.. it's all very exciting. but then you might have already read all this in aussie news, if you keep up?"

"event","Wow! I can't believe I'm writing in this thing. After all this time; after all these years.

To-day was another episode of demonstrating to 1st year chemists at uni, from 2-5 pm which has to be the most stressful period of my week during which i cannot even de-stress by laughing giddy-ish-ly at another human being. Not that i do that a lot. Actually, I've found spider solitaire to be the ultimate in relaxation recently (in the past half hour). Ah! What IS the link to a spider, I wonder?

I am finding more and more that all the expenses in my life stem from one main thing: 21sts. (see, if i didn't have to spend all that money now i would think, hey, i have money to spend on sending something far away.. like to france) As it is i may still do that, now that i have actually written it down. How about a choc-chip muffin? 

I must to din."

"event","My grandma is on the verge of death and I don't know what to feel. Should I be feeling sad and depressed? I think i'm more angry then anything, angry that i have school and work and that i can't see her, angry that she forgets who i am on my birthday, angry that i didn't know her more...angry that she can't stay alive forever.

I haven't really told anyone much about what's going on with her, I kind of just keep it all bundled up inside, because if I talk about it i'll burst into tears. I told Deanna about it the other day, and I almost had a breakdown. I wish that she came to visit more often,I wish all of my dads family visited. Because I miss them...I miss being there. I miss Nessa...and I miss David...

There's something missing in my life, and I just can't figure any of it out. I don't know what to do with life anymore, with school with work. I just wanna spend my money all the time and get drunk. I can't even save up for fuck sakes!

I miss last summer and how i never had to think...its all a blur but I know it was safe. Furby street, the airplane road and monck avenue will never be the same."

Worn out places, worn out faces

Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

The tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression

Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow.

And I find it kinda funny,
I find it kinda sad.
The the dreams in which I'm dying,
Are the best I've ever had

I find it hard to tell you,
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles,
It's a very very...mad world, mad world!

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

And I fear the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me

Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

You said the doctors had found a lump,
When I head this my heart went thump.

Remembering all the good times we had,
Brought me to this state of feeling sad,
From shopping to garage sale hopping,
Our good times will never die,
Nothing about our relationship is a lie.
A tear drops slowly down my face,
I suddenly feel displaced,
The tear reaches my chin,
I think this is a battle I will not win,

"event","Sometimes, I don't know where it all started to go wrong. I used to be happy, I used to love to sing and dance and act and play music. I was a girl who always put others first and who never thought of herself. It was you before me, or them before I.

My parents sheltered me from the cold, from the evil that the life brings to us. They kept me safe in our little Norwood bungalo. I never thought anything bad would happen to my family, or friends because...I was Micheline...and God loved me.

Then it hit me...people around me were starting to get sick..I no longer lived in eternal safety. I was surround by people dieing, by friendships fallings apart and by failure. I thought to myself...""What do I have to live for?"" And I realised, that I wasn't brought into the world for me to be happy and for me to live for me..I was hear to be brought up into to what others expected me to be. Everything had to be up to everyone elses standards. Nothing ever went perfect anymore. The one's in whom i looked up to the most were leaving me. I started to not believe in myself or in anyone else before.

What is going on with in my mind? I can't even understand it anymore, what was I ever thinking? Why was I so blind in thinking that nothing like that, or nothing like THIS would ever be happening to me. Why am I so sheltered? I need to grow up.

To Jessica...You were so talented, dedicated and aspiring. You taught me so many things, and whenever I pick up the instrument of love and compassion...I will always remember you, you're romantical fingers and your breath of wisdom.

To Lisa, you saw through others, you saw the magic in everyone. You never judged a soul, you never gave up. You were loved by me, by hundreds, by the world. And now that you are gone, I rest assured that you are in a better place. Watching down on me, knowing that I will get through this because you are my guardian angel..and I'll love you for eternity.


Won't somebody save me...because only in the water, am I beautiful."

"event","So today was cool, well it's not over yet. But so far it's been good! I took a nap, and I finally had some sleep. Which is good concidering that i haven't slept in days. Christalee sent me the slideshow that they made for lisa at her reception which i missed because i was way too upset to socialize with people. So I was glad to see that:) I woke up early this morning to go see my baby curl! Yay team shaun!! haha i met his family and friends and it was cool! I had fun, and it wasn't as boring as I thought curling was. I still don't understand half the game, but whatever. haha

Jessica is coming over soon and we are going to decorate my yard amazingly for halloween since I have made it my goal this year to have the coolest yard on my block! Way to go champs!! haha We are also going to carve pumpkins and eat seeds..MMmmmm i can't wait!!

Last night was alright, jess and I got drunk, stole pumpkins from a few yards and then I went home and locked myself in my room. Seems like i've been doing that quite often lately, I guess because of everything that happened.

I start my new job tomorrow, and i'm kind of nervous. I know it's going to be soo boring, but i don't care.I fucking love the idea of getting paid every week. It's going to be the coolest thing ever  *sings* "" I'm in the money!""

I find out this week what stage my grandma's cancer is at. Hopefully they caught it on time and she won't have to go through Chemo or anything. I'm so scared for her..but she's so brave. She's such a tough lady and so was Lisa.

This past week has been so shitty. Patrick almost killed himself on a Quad going up a hill, thankfully all he had was a few bruised ribs. Evan's lung collapsed and he spent a few nights in the hospital. I found out about my grandma AND Lisa passed away. I guess it's not wonder that i've been so crabby and sensitive. So I appoligize to everyone who's had to deal with me recently. I know I haven't been the happiest person, but that's ok....i'm getting better. I'm on the road to recovery.'

I guess all I can say now is go check out our newly studio recorded SONG!!! AT purevolume. The addy is in my User Info. I'm not sure how to post a link so i'll just tell you to click on my website in my info!!! Actually it might even be on my template! I duno..but i'm telling you..it's totally worth it!! It's called Design my Spine! Yay for professional recordings!!!!!!!


Ciaos!

Everyone have a happy egging tonight!"

"event","Today was the hardest day of my life. Poor Roberta and Les. We got to the church at 10:30, just as Lisa's parents (roberta and les) we're arriving. It was soo hard to see her falling apart. She ran to me and took me in her arms and we cried on eachothers shoulders. I told her that I never knew...and she was so sorry and so vulnerable. I had never seen her like that...with such a broken heart.

The ceremony was beautiful, they captured her exactly like she was...such a beautiful and spontaneous person. It was her...100%. Apparently in the hospital she'd hit the nurses with wet face clothes and tell them about all her hot guy crushes. She always wanted to to wear bright colored hospital gowns and always looked out for others before herself.

The Vincent Massey Chamber Choir sang all the songs that she had picked. She planned her whole funeral, what a brave soul. 

Ken, Marian and Scott were there..they were about the only others ones there from Rainbow Stage. Poor Scott, i felt kinda bad for him because lisa always had a huge crush on him. She'd call me almost every week to tell me about him and how she saw him a musical, or at a competition. She'd talk about how she wanted to marry him and they'd buy a nice house together and own a pink ferrari. She had so many dreams, there was so much she could have still done with her life. She was for all of us, an inspirational person, someone full of energy, honesty and love. I'll miss her forever and I'll always be comforted by the thought that I have my own guardian angel up there. 

Lisa...if somehow you are watching me...I love you and i'm glad that you are in a better place. You suffered so much, you were so courageous...you'll forever be alive, in all our hearts.


XOXOXOX"

River Of Dreams Released: 1993 


Goodnight, my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away 

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark
And deep inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me 

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me 

Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on...
They never die
That's how you
And I
Will be"

I just found out like....24 hours ago that my grandma might have cancer and now about 20 minutes ago, christalee tells me that Lisa Mitchell ( a friend of the family, but mostly mine,for so many years) was diagnosed with cancer in september....and no one fucking told me. She was in the hospital for a month....and then they moved her to paliative care....and yesterday...she passed away.....
 
I can't believe this happened...I just saw her this summer, and she was so happy and I only got to see her a few times. I didn't even get to say goodbye in the fucking hospital, i didn't know she was sick..I didn't know. I loved her. She touched so many hearts, she did so much for others...even if she had down-syndrome......she still graduated from high school, worked hard, loved life and others...and she was everybody's best friend. I loved her sooooooo much!!!!!
 
I'll miss you so much...you'll always be in my heart, my lisa....
 

Goodnight my angel..."

The rice was actually soft and warm and the seaweed was edible! MMM yummmmm. I had fun, we talked about stuff...and yeah it had been awhile and it was fun.

Jess is now dragging me out to the u of w to visit her girlfriend, or ex..or something dramatic like that. Oiiii! I hope i don't see people I know, because i'll feel like killing them. I'm just in a very hormonal mood, ya know how it is.

OMG LOUISE DIED ON PASSIONS!! FUCK THAT SUCKS...all those years of having a major crush on him! shit shit!! that's fucked up!

Shaun went to look for the treasure yesterday, i thought it was pretty humurous..too bad they didn't find anything, would have been cool. I still think he should keep on lookin'.

"event","For those of you that don't know or haven't heard yet... My jeep got ran into this weekend by a drunk driver and I am responsible for a pretty hefty deductible($500). That taken into consideration I am trying to do as much hair or babysitting that I can in the next week and a half. So if anyone needs a cut, color, kids watched...anything let me know. I'd love to do it. I'm off all this week so I am available any time. Please let me know if there's anything you need done or know anyone  who's looking for a sitter.

Friday night we had a surprise birthday for Dave at Bucca de Beppo's! It was so much fun hangin with everyone and playing with the scoring fly swatter he got for his present. Brooke scored 100! lol just kidding.
After dinner we all migrated over to daverthumps which had karaoke and thats when the drinks came flying:) What a cool bar..... 
Last night we went to Corey's birthday and that was fun. It was good to have thew old gang back together and even better when we all ended up at Pegasus for karaoke once again. Man did the fella's rock!!! Dont worry... I will bring my karaoke machine to the camping trip! Then we'll really see who's lost that lovin' feeling:) Brooke had her new flame show up and he seems like a great guy. I think it will be fun cuz he has a new bike and that will allow them to possibly go on rides with me and mike. Mike..hummmm, He's suppose to be back from Utah tonight sometime. last 4 days w/o him...lol yeah, um sucked:) 
Todays mom's day. Brooke and I just got back from free tan day at sun studios... man did we get dark. Mikes gonna have some competition now......riiiight. Too bad he missed out on free day day:( 
We're all playin domino's at Brooke's house tonight for those who wanna come. Not starting till 10 though cuz we're both off now to go do family stuff...... except for rick that is. He's home tearing the carpet out of his jeep, and spray painting it black.... what a weirdo! 
I had some odd dream last night about all of us paint balling... perhaps a kirkland mafia event... hummmmmm. and I had a PINK hopper!!! now thats HOT!!"

Ok Everyone... sorry for the delay in this e-mail.... 
It has FINALLY been decided. 
April 8-10th @ Lummi Island for
STACYE'S 28th B-day!!!
 
We will be leaving Friday the 8th around 6pm or so..... It's about a 2 hour drive North.... 15 min past Bellingham.
You take Lummi Island Exit off I5... 
go Left off Exit.
Go Left at Casino.
You'll run right in to a small ferry about 25 miles down the road. It's a 15 car ferry and the cabin is right as you get off the ferry on the left. You wont miss it!!
It's a good idea to bring a tent and sleeping bags just incase, food and of course alcohol. There is a small store on the island but very expensive... plan ahead. It's a full loaded cabin... bathroom, shower, huge kitchen and 2 beds, but a lot of room for people to camp out on floor or yard. 
 The cabin is also right on the beach so beach gear could get fun!!
If you have any questions at all just give us a ring.....

Jason found his way to the wrong hotel room:)
Nick took me and Brookelyn to a strip club! lol funny shit!
Stacye ran out of Capri Smokes and they dont sell them in Canada....bullshit
Stacye and Brookelyn went shopping with Nick and Jason the next day.
Stacye and Brookelyn got tattoos...
stacye= a cross
brookelyn= a star
We all drank way tooooo many Vodka Slims.... $23 bucks canadian
Found a mass amount of 2-22's.
Changed plans for my B-day and going to Canada instead with everyone instead of Vegas. Cheaper and this way more people can afford to go! Holiday Inn Baby!!
bom bom bom bom! (aka tracy tuffs comedy line)
Only thing missing in Canada was Rich....and Debbie....and Corey...and corey running around with Jellos shots... can u believe they dont make those at the bars in canada?  
Nick and Jason telling stories....reminising of the good old days of how much trouble they all would have gotten in to if the 4 of them had been there together..... lol- maybe u could have gotten tattoos to remember the awesome trip like us girlie's did!"

Jason asked brooke and I to be his valentines dates and we agreed. He played pull tabs and won like 200 bucks.... Hotel and roses for us he said! lol cuz it's gonna be shhhhweeet! I hope Jason's eyes are doing good today. I couldnt see for a couple days after I had my eye surgery. humm... think we'll go by there after we watch the game today! 
Last night was a little odd. We started out at Daman's in Bellevue....watched some of the comic then sang so Karaoke. B and I rocked ""Goodbye Earl"". This place was straight out of Road House! 3 dudes with mullets even. Fear the Mullet!!!! 
We took as much as we could and then headed off to 8th Street Bar. Brooke's new crush was there playing pool with a couple of his buddy's and he invited us over. Way cool guy that scott is! Him and brooke would be cute together. He's even in a Punk Rock band! He's gonna show me the moves on my new guitar!! Golden!!

 Since I'm doing the ""I didn't mention first time arounds"".... thought I'de also say welcome to our favorite new 24 hr Starbucks right in our Kirkland Mafia town! About damn time!!
This weekend was a blast! Friday night Colm and I went to waldos to see Lisa and Jason(www.strippedlive.com) aka...the old ""Those Guys"". They cracked me up by asking me to come up on stage and then they sang ""Stacy's Mom"". lol It was tighhhhht! Nick was bartending so needless to say it was a good night. Ended up crashing at Colm's. Fun Times!!
Saturday Jeff and I drove up to Brooke and Aimee's and we all went shopping at Old Navy, a way nice dinner at The Keg and then headed off to Bc McDonalds. We played pool for a while then Jeff and I ended up trying our luck at BlackJack. I was doing great....started with $40 Had about $300+ then lost it all in the matter of minutes. But we played for close to 3 hours. Didn't even leave till after 2:30am. And driving home was fun.... Snow Snow Snow!
Sunday just hung out with MOM buying things to revamp my house. Had a good time rearranging things last night... not that I got a whole lot done considering the whole IM thing. People are always on on sunday nights... couldnt break away.
That awesome new guy(Mark) that I met at Pegasus a couple weeks ago called me last night and asked me if I wanted to go to the rocker. I was already at home in PJ's though...lol at 6:30...so maybe I'll give him a call tonight and we can work something out. He's sooo nummy!! And his voice is insanely good. He was so cute and sang ""The Dance"" for  me the other night. The whole ""wicked games"" was also a good one."

So lets see, this last year has been quite intense. Can't say that I'm really sad to see it gone. Lost a dear friend a few months ago in a motorcycle accident. Most of u know him as ""CAPO"" from the old Taps n Tabs. He ran security at all the clubs in Kirkland as well as being the owner of the stretched white excersion(sp) we saw around town all the time.  Lost a couple other amazing people by geography.... Jen in AZ, Corey in TN.... lol couln't keep jake away though... he's back living in North Bend with his snotty ass wife. oh oops. maybe i should be nice about that one:) lol
Still doing comedy nights with everyone on wednesdays at pegasus.... group has windled down a bit though and a few new members have been added to our amazing Kirkland Mafia.... The newest and youngest member being connor! what a cute little man:)  Jeff & Colm are also new members but there are of age:) 
AND IT""S GOOD= we have a few new sayings... me, brooke, and aimee,,,,, the whole and it's good thing. thats due to our favorite bartenders at waldos. Benn spending quite a few nights there... like the night just me brooke and richie and christian were there...I mean thats it... no one else in the whole place. brooke decideds to start pole dancing in just my scarf. lol  another night... naked haircutting.... that was fun... cold but fun...
GET ER DONE!= another stacye brooke & aimee comment... we kyped it and we are ruinning with it. It's so hot!!
WHAT DO THE 5 FINGERS SAY TO THE FACE?   SLAPPPPPP!= from our camping trip up to granite falls...hey maybe i'll post pics of that. 
and the best of the best from 2004......
TOOOOUUUCHHH DDDDOOOOOWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNNNNN! = LOVE THE TOUCHDOWNS!!!

anyways- New Years was a little weak this year. Brooke and I decided to ditch the whole guy date thing and we went to the shark. We've gone there sooo many years for New Years but it just wasn't the same w/o Corey running around with trays of jello shots and jason handing out blinky necklaces to see boobs... lol- just ran across a ols photo of the boys as boobologists. Man u guys were soooo funny!

Not much is going on as of right now... still hanging w/ Mike. almost 2 yrs now... nothings ever gonna come of this. lol I miss the good old days when my favorite 2 people in this whole world used to argue over who got to walk me to my car:) lol man how times have changed... just wish i could say that i believed they changed for the best for everyone. Ok not trying to sound bitter but damnnnnnn some dumb ass shit has been done this last year.
I think i'll add a bunch of pics...sound good....ones people havent seen plastered all over Kirkland Mafia:)

I'm taking off now to go to dinner and a drive- in  movie w/ Rich,Brooke,Aimee, and a few other friends. It should be awesome. A relaxing evening is exactly what we all need after  the ordeal last night.  We were at a friends bands house having a bbq/party and some girl cried rape and when the cops finally got called she re-nigged on her story. What a mess....Noone we were with even knew the girl. I guess she is dating a guy that lived down the street and they were making there way to where we were all at and I guess she got pulled into the bushes and got attacked. It was scary. I hope she ends up being alright and all that jazz. 
Anyways- Rich and Lashonta had a good night chattin and what not. They've known each other for years so it will be awesome if they end up hookin up. 
As for me I need to figure out what I want and if the guy I'm seeing is the right one for me. I'de hate to waste his time and mine if I can tell already that things arn't meshin well. 
More to come later.

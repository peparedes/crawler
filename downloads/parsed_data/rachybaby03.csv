"event","Friday I worked from 9-5:30. It was really boring and frustrating! I worked a small party with this girl Christina. We didnt really have to do much, we basically just stood there the whole time and talked. During my break me jenny shana and some boys from work ordered pizza and just hung out and eat it. When I came back from break Christina had to leave and go to her other job so it was just me covering the party,while these two other girls(ronnie and marry) worked another party. They both decided to break at the same time, so I got stuck working two parties at once. I was so pissed. People at work are really starting to drive me crazy, I cant take most of them anymore. After work I went home and got ready to go to Ashley C's sweet 16. It was cute, I love getting dressed up. She looked really pretty in her dress.=) Happy Sweet 16 baby<3 Ugly club fo life. After the party Shana just slept over.. we didnt nothing. I had a bad day and was pissed off at everything so I just went to bed while she was on the computer.

Today I worked from 10-6:30. It was another pretty easy day untill the end when everything everyone did pissed me off so bad.Like I said before Im getting so sick and tired of everyones shit. Im sick of taking crap from people at work, always trying to being nice to everyone and doing everything for everyone. The only ones I can stand to be around anymore are Jenny and Shana becuase they actually do work. When we were cleaning up the kitchen, the other girls decided to fool around and throw food all over the place so I have to pick it up. agh It just pissed me off so bad just thinking about today. Then someone asked me what was wrong and I told them that I was mad becuase no one does work and then for saying how I felt.. I got bitched out. So eff it.Im done being nice to people who are just so ignorant to me.

Love always,
Rachel

ps.- to all you aholes who are wondering.. NO Im not PMSing either.. thanks!"

Ive been working so much..its sucks right now I guess.. but it wont when Im the one driving the nice ass car!!

:: My week ::

Sunday- I had to work at lenape from 10-6:30. It was a really busy day for me anyway. After work Ashley had some people back at her house to swim. It was alright.. I swam for like 2 min, and then we all played pool. Afterwards Shana spent the night.

Monday- I chilled with Shana all day and did nothing at all. We were so bored that we went to Best Buy and bought the Sims game. No everyone is back to being addicted to it. You can thank us guys :). Madd later in the night Jessie came over and we all just hung out, played sims, eat, and had some fun.

Tuesday- Had a doctors appt. to get my stiches out.. But that didnt go over to well. He said that it was healed all the way and that I would need to come back next Tuesday. Which really blows becuase these stiches are a pain. After the appt. we dropped Jessie off at work.. then Shay off at home and I had to go into work (custard castle) at 12. It was an easy day so it didnt really bother me. Later that night I just went to my dads and did nothing.

Wednesday- Left my dads house around 12 something and then came back to my moms and just chilled. Then my dad picked me up and took me to work at 6.. I didnt get done till 10:30 which kinda sucked.. But Jessie got dropped off at the Custard stand and then afterwards we just came back to my moms and chilled.

Thursday- Me and Jessie woke up around 10 something and got ready to go to the beach with my fam. It was alllot of fun :). The water was really cold but still alot of fun.  Me and Jess met this lifegaurd there his name began with an A or and E.. I dunno something like that-I forget!! Other than the really bad sunburn, I had fun. We left the beach around 3 and then just took Jess home becuase I had to be into work at 5. It was alright,we were kind of really busy though.

Friday- I didnt do anything all day. Just sat around and eat mcdonalds. Around 5 my dads came and got us and we went back to his house. After Jess got off work I met her at the mall for like 45 min. We just shopped! It was fun. We ran into Ashley and Chase there too :). After the mall Jess just came back to my dads house and we made cookies,watch floridas tapes,eat,and watched a walk to remember and balled our eyes out lol.

Saturday(today)-I had to be in at work at 10 so we dropped Jessie off in the morning and I just went to work. The only servers in were me and Jenny. It was a pretty easy day,nothing to hard. After work I went home and got ready for the hometown celebration. It was alright.. I really didnt have that much fun, plus I thought the fireworks sucked. So right now Im just sitting home by MySeLf updating you on my boring life!

Right now its 12:23* HApPY 4tH Of JuLy!!!!*

Thursday I got a phone call madd early in the morning from my boss saying he needed me in at work asap(at Lenape park). So I went into work from 10-4:30.

Saturday I had to be in at work(lenape..if you havent noticed i have 2 jobs lol)at 10. It was alright I had and easy party so the day wasnt too bad. I made a 25$ tip woo hoo!! Bridget(my step mom) picked me up from the park and I just went back to my dads. Right after I got home Jessie called me up and invited me to sleep over. So we met her at acme and then I just went back to her house. We rented Secret Window and 40 days and 40 night. Secret Window was awesome. I loved it. 40 days and 40 nights was too funny. I loved the part where he was flying through the boob clouds haha!

Today(Sunday)me and jess woke up around 10:30 and her mom made us eggs and sausage yummm :). We left her house around 11:45 becuase jess had to be in at work at 12. After we dropped jess off her mom just took me home. We were supposted to go to my brothers baseball game...but it was cancelled. So they had a fathers day bbq at the fields.

"event","Saturday me and shay just hung out and took crazy pics, its was kinda gay and boring.
Saturday night shays mom picked me and her up at my house and we went back to shays and got ready to go to Trump Marina becuase her mom was working the Train concert. Me and shay decided to sneak past security and get into the show..we did =) but about 5 min. before the show was about to start,the guy who is head security for the whole freaking casino (basically Donald Trumps best friend) comes up to us and tells us that we cant be here. So we're surrounded by 50 HUGE security guys,everyones looking at us, and they told us we have to leave the casino asap. But they wouldnt let shays mom leave work cause she would have gotten fired. So we called up everyone but no one was answering =( so finally we got a hold of Dana. So Danny Jackie and Dana came and got us in AC. The security people told us to go out the parking garage..so we did, but then me and shay got lost. There was all these weird people and noises.We were so scared! But then we finally asked the lady at the ticket booth thing how to get out and she helped us. On they way home we got free water ice =)nothing better then free food when your scared shitless!! They dropped us off at my house and me and shay just chilled the rest of the night.

Danny, Jackie , Dana -- Thanks soooo much for getting us! I dont what i would have done without u guys<33333333333

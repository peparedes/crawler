"event","mmm i always expect the unexpected but never have i ever unexpected the expected. I expected to be single on the 6th. i expected to wake up the next morning after a horrible night's sleep and come to the realization one more time. i did not expect how hard it would hit. i did not expect to be so angry and bitter. i did not expect to try to ignore it because i really didn't want it. and i didn't expect everything to remind me of him like it does in movies. seriously, this world is fucked up and every song on the radio and every t.v. show and movie on t.v. and everyeveryEVERYTHING makes me reminisce. ""everybody wang chung tonight"" was playing in the store today. fuck. Listerine was on sale today. fuck. one of the categories on Jeopardy was ""grateful dead"" today. fuck. one of the clues on wheel of fortune today was ""the green mountains of Vermont."" fuck. Never have i ever been this deep in denial and regret, never have i ever hated being mature this much. It's okay to just be best friends with someone you love, but it's not that easy when you're in love with them. I want to go to bed until I get to go to college."

"event","okay
so today was interesting...i had a panic attack in western civ and went into hysterics...i was laughing and crying at yelling at people and it was so bad...i dont know what the fuck was wrong with me but im glad its over because now that ive been pushed over the edge nothing's really bothering me. i had my crazy vulnerable spazmatic morning and now i'm just like....i dont know...post-earthquake i guess. im sort of still feeling vulnerable and i also slapped brYan in the face today for absolutely no reason and im still obviously slightly insane but by tomorrow morning i'm sure ill be back to normal, whatever the fuck that is. no, i'll be better tha normal because now i know what's going on in my head. i sdont know how to fix it, but i know that stuff exists in it and im prepared to get over it. hoorah. these are my goals:
1. no more buying stupid magazines (only vanity fair and national geographic)
2. no more fakeness
3. drink a lot of water (start carrying a nalgene around, i have two and im not sure why i dont use them)
4. stop worrying about stupid things like how i look
5. set realistic expetations for myself
6. have more alone time
7. play my bass more (ive been neglecting my baby!)
8. get over my stage fright
9. focus more on my schoolwork
there are probably more but i dunno these are the first that come to mind. im not really expecting to achieve them too soon they're just sort of general.
aaaaaah (that was a sigh of relief.)
okay i'm done stick a fork in me."

i [and my mother] picked up Brendan at Grand Central yesterday and spent the day in NYC...went to madame tussaud's wax meuseum and got our pictures taken with jimi hendrix and the beatles and whatnot--great fun, great fun...anyways, and we came back here and ordered pizza and watched the olympics [the opening ceremony was kind of weird towards the end...] and then at around 11:00 decided we should watch Billy Madison...because we just wanted to or something...so that hapened and i was high on sugar then i ran out of energy and we went to bed...woke up this morning, made lots of experimental french toast and finally mastered the art of making it and stuff...it was super-yummy. THEN since Brendan didnt bring his guitar [which is okay because then we would have had to carry it around NY anyways...] he tried out my bass...he gave up fast...but thats okay! and so we listened to music for a while and then my parents got home from shopping for fruit or something...and we were all prepared to see Collateral at 2:00 but they got back at 2:15 so we waited till the 4:10 showing of it...well i thought it was 4:1- but it was really 4:40 so we had to wait around again for a while..we wandered around the strip mall...great fun great fun...then we came home and played some pool and then i had to do something else so my dad and brendan had some nice rivalry goin on...anyways i have to go to dinner!"

You have a strong,<br>independant, fiery personality and you<br>obviously don't ley other's puch you around.<br>You like being in charge and don't care what<br>other people think. In fact, you like to stand<br>out and be yourself. You're probably shy when<br>people first meet you but your a ball of energy<br>that could explode at any given moment. You<br>like to laugh and whether you admit it or not,<br>you like to fight. You're peronality that is<br>wild and untamable. You're beauty is physically<br>fit and a little sexy and you have a very<br>pretty face.

[i guess i DO like to fight...and laugh a LOT...and i suppose some would say that i am a ball of energy that could explode at any moment...].

my nose is blue from the paint.
*sigh*

i hate the radio. it plays crap and it plays this crap over and over again--theres like a 4-song list that they play over and over and over again...im going to implode if i hear any of those songs again (but that one by that 13 year old JOJO or what ever...she pisses me off...and makes me want to kill someone...preferably her...she ahs no talent and she should go home because she sucks at life.)

sorry im just kind of at a point where i need to be with people that arent my parents...or my dog...theyre all pissing me off...i need one of my friends...like Bryan or Jason or Johanna or Nicole or Brendan or Allie or something...

i just got back from Florida with Johanna and Nicole...and it was FUCKING AWESOME! At first, Jojo was like, ""but i dont WANT to go to Disneyworld because im scared of the rollercoasters!!!!!!"" and so nicole and i forced her to go on rides...we weaned her, dont worry we arent heartless...

MONDAY:

we started her on Pirates of the Caribbean, then splash Thunder Mountain, then Splash Mountain, then johanna goes, ""OOH LETS DO THAT ONE!"" and points at Space Mountain...so there ya go. just goes to show that you DO have to face your fears to get over them. well, until the next day...

TUESDAY:

We attempted the impossible: JOhannas biggest fears: falling,being dropped, and heights. Yeah, we made her go on the tower of terror. okay fine we are kind of a tad bit heartless...oops...nicole and i were laughing and smiling the whole time, but johanna gets off, near tears, in shock, and finally goes, ""It felt like someone was KILLING me.....[whimper}""
and then nicole and i felt really bad...not really i think i just sort of told her to get over it...oh well...

WEDNSDAY:

we went to the mall and i met the love of my life:
i wanted a cookie, and jo and nicole wanted ice cream. then, since they were still getting ice cream and i was done getting my cookie, i walked over to Edy's to wait with them. well, getting ice cream was NOT written into my schedule, considering i had a huge cookie in my hand...but i look up and see the cutest guy i have EVER seen in my life: he was average height, about sixteen, darkish brown hair, honeyish eyes, braces, the slightest lisp, and tan. and he had straight teeth already so the braces made him cuter...and he had dimples when he smiled--which he did a lot of at me...anyhoo...then i ordered ice cream so i could stare at him longer..and then i for cherries becasue he would have to look for them, stalling, for even more time, and then it was time to pay :( but then...he pretended that he could find pennies, and i saw he had lots, but i looked for them in my wallet anyways and i found them and looked up and he like...looked away...and it was adorable..then we left, and i was sad because as nicole put it, ""my heart had been frozen then soft-served to some old man in a waffle cone..."" so i turned around, grabbed nicole, and said ""i am going to ask for a chocolate ice cream and his phone number."" so we marched all the way back, and there was a long line..and it was his first day on the job so he took a while and we were late so we had to go...but he saw us, recognized us, smiled hi adorable smile, and after he saw we were leaving he looked all sad and went into the back room to mop. yay i had an effect on him. or nicole did. or we both did. whatever. the end."

"event","You can shed tears that she is gone
or you can smile because she has lived. 
You can close your eyes and pray that she'll come back
or you can open your eyes and see all she's left. 
Your heart can be empty because you can't see her
or you can be full of the love you shared. 
You can turn your back on tomorrow and live yesterday
or you can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday. 
You can remember her and only that she's gone
or you can cherish her memory and let it live on. 
You can cry and close your mind, be empty and turn your back
or you can do what she'd want: smile, open your eyes, love and go on."

Her laugh is so addicting her smile is one of the most beautaful things ive ever known. She has the greenest eyes i have ever seen in my life i can just stare and get lost in them all day.

But you paid me no attention, do you.
I know you don't listen to me.
'cause you say you see straight me, don't you.
On and on from the moment I wake,
To the moment I sleep,
I'll be there by your side,
Just you try and stop me,
I'll be waiting in line,
Just to see if you care.
Did she want me to change?
But I change for good.
And I want you to know.
But you always get your way,
I wanted to say,

I hate that he is like this i blame him when i know i should not i cant stand it ive never had their for me for anything not sports when i was little not when i need him now. At least when he dies i will be out of the house im moveing Jan i think he will last tell then the only thing is i feel bad for my mom no one to come home to at all nothing....i feel bad for moveing out now but i need to get out im so sick of everything about fresno i need to get out soon one way or another. This is going to suck if my dad and G-paw go at the same time  i mean what are the odds i just hope my g_paw goes first no father should have to see his son die its not supose to work that way. well im off to the rink to play hockey i need to let out some anger about everything =......( i hate everything about anything i just want out of all this shit called my life...................i hope to god he does not die but i know he will>=..("

Make Yourself (1999)
I Miss You

To see you when I wake up, is a gift I didn't think could be real 
To know that you feel the same, as I do, is a Three-fold utopian dream 
You do something to me 
That I can't explain 
So would I be out of line, If I said 
I miss you. 
I see your picture, I smell your skin on, the empty pillow next to mine 
You have only been gone ten days, but already I am wasting away 
I know I'll see you again 
Whether far or soon 
But I need you to know, that I care 
And I miss you 

dude she is it this is the one oh my god......more info on a need to know bases!"

"event","Oh gentle winds neath moonlit skies,
Do not you hear my heartfelt cries?

Below the branches here about,
Do not you sense my fear and doubt?
Side glistening rivers sparkling streams,
Do not you hear my woeful screams?

Upon the meadows touched with dew,
Do not you see my hearts a'skew?
Beneath the thousand twinkling stars,
Do not you feel my jagged scars?

Seek not my mournful heart kind breeze,
For youll not find it mongst these trees.

Its scattered cross the moonlit skies,
Accompanied by heartfelt sighs.
Its drifting o're the gentle rain,
A symbol of my silent pain.

Its buried neath the meadow fair,
Conjoined with all the sorrow there.
It's lost among the stars this night,
Too far to ease my quiet fright.

No gentle winds seek not my heart,
For simply ... it has torn apart."

Though, all is home 
Emotions flow 
Am I the only one that hears the tears run down my face 
Would anybody recognize at all 
Cause I know 
I'm so slow 
But I'm still trying 
And I'm still dying to know 
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life
Life's the only thing that deals the pain 
Like pouring rain 
Breeding hate 
And I don't wanna do no wrong 
My God, it's been so long 
Please comfort me 
Before I go insance. =("

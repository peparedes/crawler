"event","i have nothing to do so i think i'll write a proper journal entry for once.

dear journal,

ummm

jennie is a sweet<3
""for real""
she so gets stuff
like why i hate feminists. and why i'm a femmenist.
and how stupid people can be
and she feels stuff the way i do.

what is ~stufF~
?
iunno i suppose stuff is just trivial nonsense that you can judge (maybe?) somebody by how they react to it?




i think i'm ~thisclose~ to actually realising something. i hope.



guy...hmmm...
i'm not sad. or mad. haha. people think i should be mad.
at her? at him?
ummmmmm
i wish i could?
since it will probably end up nasty...that's what happens.
i know i can't say anything to her....without her taking it the wrong way...i don't even want her to get hurt. not by that jerk.
if she stays ~with~ him...maybe it will work out. and if it does then he should have been with her. happy ending. and whatever i had with him was just to lead him to her.
isn't that detatched? i suppose i just expected it
maybe since i expected it i created it?

i don't know
i thought he liked me
shit i thought he understood me
but
he had a one track mind stuck on repeat and i don't like that kind of music anyway

like i have nothing else to give?

one two three repeater
repeater
one two three
repeater

(you wonder what i do...none of your fucking business)

i think i should be celibate
until i'm 21
maybe
i just don't want to confuse myself any more

i honestly don't know why i would even think that i would ~find~ somebody
not like that
i'm sure i'm just looking for too much
and im sure being a stupid dork isn't the most attractive thing
hahahahaha i'm bad at ~flirting~
(sometimes)




i still miss fag and i know he hates me and that hurts
if he hates me for what i've done it makes me sad
if he hates me for what he thought i did it really fucking hurts. that he would see me like that.

haha
""you care about that greasy ew but you don't care about the cute one""
yeah.
i'm just retarded like that.


ok this is fucked up but when i was with guy and he was kissing me i got this flashback of this asshole who i can't believe i was stupid enough to be with and so i pushed guy off me
he must have thought i was seriously fucked up in the head
but it freaked me out
his chin against my face and him against my leg
i wanted to vomit


isis myth: girl <3's guy. guy gets cut up into pieces. girl laments and finds guy's pieces and puts him back together. except she can't find his penis. so she searches for it for ages. and then says fuck it. and builds him a new one.

what i am convincing myself it means at the moment: girl <3's guy, guy gets cut up. girl can't live without guy. girl tries to find guy in many other guys but can't. girl finds guy in other girl. says fuck it. builds fake penis. happily ever after.

"event","i was this blonde pale chick in this house and i was delerious. and my sister was there and she was this brunette pale chick. and we had the same haircut and facial features so i think we were twins.  she came to stay with me to take care of me because i was having these fits and i was in the house because it was some sort of hospice. and then i (the blonde) went into this fitful sleep and woke up as the brunette in the middle of the night. and i tried to sleep but i couldn't. so i went into the hallway and saw a light in the closet. and when i went into the closet the doctor was there frantically going through all these boxes of pills. i just saw him from the back which was his long blond hair and doctor's coat. and i stood there watching him and then he turned around and he had this wolf face and he started laughing like an evil maniac and he threw a box of pills at me. so i ran away back to my room and sat on this homemade bedcover and waited for him to come in but i woke up before he did.

i will find out tomorrow if the dream had any significance.

and then i had this other dream where there were aliens who came to earth and i think i worked for the un or something so they sent me to like make peace with them? and when i went on the spaceship it just took off and they didn't understand my language so i just pointed out the window and then they took me into this room with a bed so i could sleep. and i woke up and somehow realised i was pregnant. and the baby developed really quickly and i was about to give birth. but the aliens were all guy aliens and then these girl aliens came to try to take me to their colony. because they were the same aliens only they hated each other and always went to war to kill each other if they came into contact with each other. and i telepathically found out that they only reproduce by cloning.  so i was pregnant massive and about to give birth and none of the aliens knew how to deliver a baby because they never did it before. they just kept arguing and being violent in the delivery room. so i was screaming and praying and stuff delivering this baby and thinking i was going to die and then i woke up.

all winter we'll wander in a red wagon
with cushions of blue
nice and warm. with a nest of creepy kisses
just for us two.

you shut your eyes and won't look out the window
where shadows lurk:
hordes of black wolves and black demons and nightmares
inhabit the dark.

and then in a panic suddenly you feel
a little kiss, like a scared spider, crawl
across your cheek...

you turn to me to help you find the beast,
and of course i promise to do my best,
if it takes all week...

Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

"event","i was talking to one of my friends last night about how gross it would be to recieve oral sex from those stupid gaylord fackers who are all interested in me or my best friend or whatever. you know the type...those lame guys who are all like i want to get to know you better and assume that 3 dinners + 1 bouquet of flowers + pretending to listen what you're saying - honestly expressing their true feelings and motivations = 1 occurence of sexual contact. and then once sexual contact occurs it continues to occur and gets more and more involved. because that's the protocol formula. and they always expect a tongue kiss goodnight.
i hate those stupid fuckers.
anyway i think that it would be even grosser to get head from those nasty fags with their nasty slimy tongues than it would to fuck them because a woman getting head is far more intimate than fucking. and that head for a woman is more intimate than head for a man because for a man it's putting yourself inside of someone whereas for a woman it's letting someone inside of you.
ew
fucking nasty. those stupid perverts that try to meet girls at bars are so disgusting. there's one hanging around my best friend who looks like that milo creep from the movie airheads. and she and i were talking about how gross he was and how gross it would be to do anything with him. and his name is doug. ew. it makes me nauseated to even think about getting head from him or someone like him.
gag gross puke
for me, getting head is the most intimate overtly sexual act.

i hope if i'm ever a guy i don't buy drinks massive for two spoiled girls who think they can get away with everything.

i hope if i'm ever really really lame i have a car so people will still call me.

kama. i AM the fly.  look at me now mother fucker.  just look in my eyes. i know you can see me. ""is it everything you wanted""

no

what a way to pass the hours. i could be meditating.
i'll be a nun. i'll go overseas. i'll feed the hungry and hold the children. i'll tell them there's a reason for all suffering.

reason? the reason is one fucking coctail could feed a kid in rwanda for a week.
maybe next time i get drunk when a guy asks to buy me a drink i'll tell him to send the money to amnesty international
but i probably won't.

1. put water in a tea kettle until it whistles
2. put package of ramen in frying pan and pour tea water over it
3. separate ramen and cook until soft
4. drain 95% of water from pan
5. continue to cook ramen and add seasoning packet
6. when most of water has evaporated, add virgin olive oil, mushrooms and shrimp to ramen. or whatever else you want in the ramen. that was all i had to add.
7. continue to cook ramen.

more peace than any treaty could provide

over the past 20 or 30 years the 'sexual empowerment' of women has lead to degradation...it's just great that women are 'able' to enjoy sex without being labeled nymphomaniacs, but now we're practically expected to sleep with our boyfriends. what is a woman's virtue now? being good in bed?
disease and babies man...look at all the club kids, the glorified sector of the 18-25 year old population, the hard pounding bodies who know how to enjoy their pleasures...the hole gets her free drinks and the wallet gets his rocks off.  
sexuality is just a pleasure sport and that to me is really gross."

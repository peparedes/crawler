"event","It's 7 freaking 30 in the morning and I'm at work b/c I don't have my lisence or a car.  But that's all about to change... I'm going to get my lisence sometime this week, hopefully, and we might get a new car!  Well, actually a used truck, but it's an '03 Nissan Frontier Desert Runner Extended Cab V6 Supercharged with bucket seats, 6 disc changer, power everything, towing package and only 31,000 miles.  All for about 14,200, plus tax, tags, and doc. fees.  And, it's red, so it makes it all the better.  I will probably get the Jeep, at least until I learn to drive stick, which shouldn't take to long.  Plus, I can throw some 12'' subs in the Jeep, which I couldn't in the truck.  But it's still not a sure thing, so we'll see how things play out.  I wish things were going as well with my house.  They haven't done anything in over two weeks.  Still no floors, no walls, and they haven't finished the roof.  It's pissing me off.  

I apologize to everybody if I've been a bit moody lately.  I'm sorry for being a bitch, especially to Karen.  

I'm going to start working now, hopefully I can get EC done by myself.

"event","It's Saturday night and I'm gettin' ready to leave for Scout Camp.  This would be very saddening for me, but my sweetheart, love of my life, one and only Karen Kuntarich is coming up to see me along with my family on Wednesday!  Woohoo!  :)!  I would be miserable if she wasn't coming.  Well, this is a short one because I've got to hit the road.  I'm spending the night at my dad's place in Winston-Salem tonight, then I'm meeting up with the rest of the troop tomorrow morning at camp.  This is my seventh and last year.  Wish me luck that I won't blow something off with a shotgun or break something climbing.  And for Karen, I'll try not to be eaten.  ;)  I love you baby.  I'll be back Saturday afternoon.  ONWARD! lol

"event","This has been a pretty first week of summer.  I've racked up some serious hours at the kennel, had fun at the pool, and have lounged around the rest of the time.  I must admit I was a little worried about Karen's braces, and that the kissing might change. Nope! She's still the best ever. :)  And we finished cleaning my house out yesterday.  That was a LOT of work.  I hope I'll have fun this weekend.  I'll be backpacking in the vicinity of and up Mount Mitchell, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River, statnding at 6,684 feet above sea level.  I will be lugging 45 pounds on my back for 10 miles, probably in the rain.  Fun, huh?  Well, it is for me.  As long as it doesn't rain too much...  

By the way, Karen is the best girlfriend in the world!  

Wish me luck this weekend.

And I hope that time has come for me when things get better.  Thursday night thru Saturday afternoon was probably the worst time in my life.  Yes, it overshadowed, by far, even everything in the past 4 weeks.  Karen and I had broken up, and my Grandpa passed away.  I didn't know what I was going to do.  But luckily yesterday Karen and I talked, yelled, cried, and hugged our way back together.  Talk about an emotional roller coaster.  To be so sad, then a million times more sad, then so incredibly happy.  But, we'll see how things go with everything.  Like the house being rebuilt, mine and Karen's relationship being rebuilt, and my family being rebuilt.  It's all going to be hard, but someday it will all be great again.  It can never be the same, but it will be great..."

"event","A very smart man once told me ""Mitchell, for millions of years, men have been trying to figure women out.  Many have tried, and thought they had.  You might try, and think you have figured them out, also.  But right when that happens, they'll change take you by surprise.  You might get close, but you will never figure women out, no man ever will.""  Those wise words came from my dad.  None truer were ever spoken.  He told me this right after I started going out with my first girlfriend.  I must confess, I have tried to understand women.  I have thought I had gotten close, made some progress, broken the surface.  But I was mistaken.  I realize now that it will be a long time before I have the smallest grasp of how women really are.  Even now in a serious relationship, I find myself often struggling to understand things that Karen does.  These are not always bad things, just an observation I have come to make.  
   Another observation I have made, and I don't mean to be critical of women, is that sometimes they make things harder to understand. I like to think that this is done on accident.  Women reading: although men will never figure you out, lapses can be cut down by vocalizing more about issues and not hinting and hoping a guy will recognize it.  I have observed this very often.  
   But I digress: there are many more involved in this subject, and many more theories that I have.  If you think it would be beneficial, you are more than welcome to come and theorize with me on this sometimes troublesome, yet most often overlooked aspect in not just relationships, but in life in general.  
   I leave you with one final statement.  Listen to and remember what has been written here.  You may not think this information is useful now, but I assure you, if you think about it, it will bring you to a new understanding.  I have not yet learned what this whole statement means, nor am I certain I ever will.  But I will try.  Yes, I will try..."

Then, I'll hopefully spend a little time with the best girlfriend in the world, my one true love, meine Liebste, KAREN!  She's still a little under weather, but maybe we'll be able to do something.

She brings so much happiniess and fulfillment to my life and I thank God everyday for having her in my life.

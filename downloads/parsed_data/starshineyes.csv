"event","""Is this life, to grasp joy only to fear its escape? The price of hapiness is the risk of losing it.""  

  To confide in an online journal, a blog, available for all the world to see and comment on if they so choose, is the last thing I actually felt like doing tonight. And still I type. Funny the way things work out, isn't it?
  I recently took it upon myself to make a change in my outward apperearence. I get bored with myself and often desire new looks in hopes that I might actually look pretty in one. Rarely am I pleased with any attempt; even still, I sniffed out a pair of well hidden scissors last night and began snipping away at my hair until I ended up with what I now have no choice but to wear. You'd think that I would have had enough change after dying my auburn locks purple, dark brown,adding streaks ranging from white to orange to pink to cherry red, and finally settling on a nice clean black. You'd also be wrong. I'm temporarily satisfied, but who knows how many weeks may pass before I get bored again. 
  I'm continually pissing myself off by neglecting schoolwork. I should be writing up a lab report for AP Environmental Science as well as completing some shit for AP Art History not to mention going over a reading assignment due in English. I keep telling myself that I'm going to apply myself but I get so distracted. My mind isn't in the right place. I worry about my mother. Her being in and out of the hospital is causing me to fuck up my school attendance record. Sure, they are excused but having so many absences doesn't exactly make my character look all too appealing. My grades are mediocre. I know I am so much better than that, yet I skip classes and do stupid things that really don't reflect well on myself. There are so many things in my life that already don't make it easy for me, and I go and make things even harder on myself. Self-pity certainly isn't getting me anywhere. I've got to straighten up."

Now I know that's not something to really be proud of or gloat about or anything like that... I was just excited about hanging out with my friends that I haven't been able to in forever. 

A lot of things happened at Andy's that night. A lot of really cool unexpected things. Went and kidnapped little Nathan from his home and made him come play. He's adorable. Rev and I just want to put him in our pockets. I talked to Robbie online and he said that he'd go to the zoo with me and that made me happy. Then the night lasted forever it seems. Tried to make Shane take me to Pine Bluff for some reason, lol. Got to know Andy's cousin a little better. Read the dictionary. Didn't really sleep. I think I slept a little after 6 or so and got up at 9 something. I took Alissa home and then came back to Andy's and spent the day with those little boys, lol. I eventually took my neice to Chuck E Cheese for her birthday and then came home and crashed. Only to wake up every couple of minutes to either text someone back or answer his stupid phone call. Jews. I swear, lol.

And now I have no clue what the heck is going on in my life. All I know is that I like it and I'm happy. I like the way things are and that's a real first for me. Who knows how long the happy will last considering I AM back at home with my mother. The queen of happiness killers. But I'm going to watch the Oscar's and paint at Rev's house so she won't be killing the happy tonight. Wooo.

I want to bottle up this feeling and get drunk off of it everyday of my life."

And I started passing out. And then I look back at Lenee and she looks dead. And then over to my right sits good ole Sarah Snyder passing out as well. And then she says that she has to go boo boo. And that makes me laugh. That poor old man. Poor us. Stupid Mr. Smith.

Second period was just Mr. Watson. That's all there is to say.

Relentless ranting would be pointless. No need to do so. I am happy with my life. I'm happy with the person I have grown to be. But even in the broadest of daylight lies the faintest shadow of darkness. We all have our worries and doubts. Everyone deals with confusion and identity crisis. It's all part of growing up. My confusion lies not with my integrity...I mean. I know who I am. I am Brittany. And that's all I know how to be. I am the product of a covetous mother and a muted father. I am the portrait painted by friends recycled and lost. Under the influence of older ""cool"" kids and family members who seem to have disappeared, a shy chubby little chipmunk learned to sing and to laugh and to cherish her loved ones as well as her surroundings. She grew from a chubby little chipmunk without an opinion to a bright young woman with enough wit and charisma to crack a smile on her FATHER's crinkled face. And that's quite an achievement. I know who I am. I am Brittany Nicole Porter. I am the girl who walks into closed doors while off in a colorful daydream. I am the girl that never takes the time to think about the words coming out of her mouth. I am the girl that dazes out in a conversation and then tosses and turns all night over the words she COULD HAVE said but hadn't thought of at the right moment. I am the girl that beats herself up for not making a move when the moment was right. I am the girl who prays to whatever's out there for a sign that things aren't always what they seem. I am the girl suffering of romanticism with every thought revolving around this world's chaotic beauty. I know exactly who I am. So why is it that I cannot make my mother approve of who I am? Why is it that I cannot hold my father's attention for more than five minutes? Why is it that I spend my days chasing? Why can't I relax and revel in all of the wonderful things that I already have? Why must I chase? I really hate chasing my parents. I hate chasing the affections of those who have no intention of letting me catch it. You can't always get what you want. But patience is a virtue. It's a beautiful life."

"event","Alissa spent the night with me last night after a pretty groovy time at Danyelle's. I cleaned the day away and alissa spent the entire time in my bathroom organizing it and scrubbing it. I love you, Lissa-burr. You rock my socks. 

My mom was quite pleased when she came home. That was good. I took Alissa to taco bell and then dropped her off at her mommy's work. Then I went and got Kaylie from my sister's house and we went with mi madre to wal*mart. Now we are home and listening to the BeeGees. It's great. My dad is nowhere to be found and it's just us babes. My mom hasn't yelled at me. I've been my normal sarcastic self. Everything is perfect. I got some new clothes and they are in smaller sizes than what I normally buy. I love the swimming pool. Getting smaller is greatness.  

My sister has left a voice message on my phone saying ""TAG YOU'RE IT!"" Because we are losers that play phone tag. Now I must call her. wheeeeeee family.

This weekend should be fun. Kelly Clarkson... I love her. That's just all there is to say. Well... and maybe ""SINCE U BEEN GONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNE!""  THAT's all there is to say. 

Now I'm off to play with Kaylie. Who know's what we'll do. Probably destroy something. That's always fun. Or maybe we'll jump on the bed and throw pillows around. Or maybe we'll put on too much make-up and take pictures. Maybe we'll just chill and watch a movie. Maybe I'll shut the hell up and actually DO one of these things... witcha!!!"

I'm going to the gym again tonight. I love swimming more than FOOD. It's truly beautiful. My day was wonderful. I haven't been able to say that in a long long time. But today, dammit, I'm saying it. Not one bad thing made me feel down or low. I was happy happy or just off in a daze. And when I'm off in a daze I'm happy because my dream world is the best place a Bwitnay could ever be. I haven't visited my imaginary family in a long time either. I miss them. In fact. I think I'll daze off in the car and see how they are doing this afternoon. Hope I don't die, kids. Daydreaming behind the wheel of a car is quite dangerous. But I'm pretty good at it so. Don't start calling dibs on my awesome earthly treasures just yet...

How come I never hear you say, ""I just wanna be with you""? Guess you never felt that way. BUT SINCE YOU BEEN GONE!!!!!!!!!!! I can BREATHE for the FIRST TIME! SINCE YOU BEEN GONE, YEAH, YEAH! Thanks to YOU, now I GET, I get what I WANT. 

I need to go shopping. I'm such a girl sometimes. I can't help it. Shopping??? hmmm. Sounds like a job for LENEE AND JULIA!!!! My shopping expert and my german lover. 

Well I'm out like a light. Mandy has made me want to laugh at other people's misfortunes. I love you."

"event","I actually spent time with my FATHER!!!! It's amazing. And it was fun. Rev came along too, so you know we had a jolly good time. We went out to eat, went to Cingular, and then to Barnes and Noble. He bought the Illustrated Beatles lyrics for me. I love it. Reveille and I plopped onto my bed and went through the entire book and sang every song. We rule. The fab four would be proud. Then we watched Return of the King for the rest of the night. God. Orgasm all over the place. That's twice in one week for me. Sheesh. I do not regret a single second. Legolas and Aragorn. Mmm Mmm Mmm. Arwen. Mmm Mmm Mmm. Shut up, me. Very well then. 

Rev and I woke up this morning a couple of times before we actually woke up. The first time was when I was dreaming about Rev. She was talking to the church congregation. She was asking them and God if she should change underwear or wear the ones with shit stains. I was having convulsions of laughter in my sleep and Rev woke me up asking if I was okay. And then I told her about my dream and laughed some more and passed back out.

We finally got up and watched Babes in Toyland. Then we watched a bit of Ghost World before leaving for her house. We got here and realized we wanted coffee so to Barnes and Noble we went. Ran into Nathan and Sarah(Ping-Ping) and sat with them for a bit. Then we came home and ate White Chilli. Tasty stuff. I talked to most of my favorite people all at once. Rev, Yellers, Katie, Bren Bren, and Robbiekins. A bunch of bafoons. Gotta have it, though. Gotta have it. 

I'm not one for gossip... but I heard that Danyelle smells like monkey butt, Katie licks the bottom of her shoe, Brendan wears pull-ups with sailboats on them, and Reveille likes crackwhores on Saturday nights. That's just what I heard. :-P"

Then she thought she was sure
By the way you two could have fun
But now she might leave
Like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast
Before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'cause you want

To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in a safe a lock it
'cause it's home sweet home

And in your own mind
You know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her
But now you're scared
You think she's running away
You search in your hand for something clever to say
Don't go away

Put it in the safe and lock it

"event","Stupid Sickness. I fart in your general direction. I cleaned today. I made my bed with the help of Reveille, who then hops into it and snuggles with my teddy bear. So I cleaned AROUND her. While she watched Donnie Darko. In my bed. With my toys. Oh well, lol. At least I cleaned that room of mine. It needed it. But as you all should have already known... my mother doesn't give a shit about the good things that I do. So as I was cleaning she comes up and tells me that I have to cook dinner. And I say ""ok"", but we don't have the groceries to make it. So she throws a big fit and finally puts some clothes on and goes to the store like a responsible adult and buys groceries. I keep cleaning. She gets home and starts dinner and expects me to know when to come in and finish it. I am sick. So after I finsihed cleaning my room, the guest room, and the bathroom I laid down next to Rev and watched some of the movie. And kinda fell asleep. So my mom goes crazy and starts banging stuff around in the kitchen and yelling at me and making a bigger mess. So I jump up and go try to help her. But she doesnt want my help anymore. She wants to yell at me. Dinner was ruined (even though it was just fine) and it was all my fault. She then sat down and did her daily crossword while I finished up in the kitchen and prepared a plate for everyone, except Rev who had made her way to the kitchen and made her own. I asked my mom why the meat looked different than usual and she blew up on me, saying that she probably got the wrong kind and it's all my fault becuase she has bad eyesight. She didn't have her glasses with her when she went to the store so she picked up the wrong stuff so it's my fault. And I told her that it sounded like she had a problem. And she yells ""YEAH I HAVE A PROBLEM, YOU STUPIDASS, PEOPLE WHO CANT SEE USUALLY HAVE A PROBLEM!!"" So then I took a breath and tried to ignore her calling ME a stupidass and told her that I was sorry for being sick and I couldn't go out to the store for her and do her job as mother of the houselhold but as for the whole not wearing glasses even though she knows that she has poor eyesight, and then blaming everything that goes wrong in her life on me, it seemed like she may need to grow up a little bit. So of course she's screaming at me by that point, telling me that I am the one that needs to grow the fuck up and start doing something with myself and cooking and cleaning and working an 8 hour job like her, and how she does everything around this house and I do nothing. She doesn't even know what AP classes are, yet she's sure that my schoolwork isn't as hard as I make it out to be and that I'm just a lazy bum who would rather be out with my friends than at home with a father who's never around and won't talk when he is, or a mother that picks fights for no fucking reason and blames it all on me simply because ""i'm the daughter and she's the mother, so i must be wrong.""  And with that...I stop trying to communicate with her all together."

"event","Moved in with Rev for the weekend. My mother threw a hissy. But oh well. We had a lot of fun. Watched plenty of movies, ate plenty of yummy goodies. Played a fair share of Super Nintendo. I painted while Rev played Mario with 75 lives, so doing stupid things like jumping straight into a hole and dying at the start of a level was considered fun. And fun-NY. I absolutely adore Harold and Kumar. I want some White Castle. And I want to marry Kumar. ""Thank you, come again!"" hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Good stuff. Am I the only one that can't help but make up songs to the music on Mario? I mean... it just plays over and over and before you know it words are flowing out. And they are usually pretty ridiculous. And Rev will join in. And we'll fall over and die a little from a laughing fit. I've gotta fever and the doctor says the only cure is a little more mario. ""did you fuck my mother? did you fuck my mother? yes i fucked your mother. yes i fucked your mother. yes i fucked her, and you may ask her, and she'll say it was good."" yeah. if you can figure out the mario tune to that then sing out my friends. because we certainly did. we had a whole story going about this guy that had sex with his friend's mother. lol. jeezie creezie. crazy? i was crazy once..."

And of course... there's the naked fat ladies that make life worth living in the locker room. Heh Heh. Gotta love it. I still smell like poolness. That's always fun. 

I didnt go into school until 6th period and it was great. I slept in. Took a shower. Ate breakfast. Watched Stepford Wives. Slept some more. Got ready. Then I called myself in a check-in and stood around at 1st lunch for a bit before finally going to class. Then I read The Secret Garden in Drama. And I got in trouble with my friends in Orchestra for playing in the kiddie toys with the lights off. What a wonderful day. 

I should probably do my homework. Yup. That's what I'm gonna do now. Cuz I'm smart. *looks around* Not a word, kiddos. Not a word."

I told Robbie that I liked him. (so stupid. so so stupid, brittany) I don't even know what the deal is with that situation. All I know is. He's glad that I told him. But he's got other stuff going on right now and I suck. I'm taking this as an ""I don't fucking like you, Brittany. Please stop bothering me."" So. I shall do everything within my power to stop liking him. Even if it means going out with Dusty Johnson. (i sound like rev) Gotta love it. Dusty, if you're reading this... Will you go out with me? lol. No. Seriously. I want a Valentine. I love me. You should love me too.

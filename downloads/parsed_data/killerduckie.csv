"event","So John's dad and Cindy and I&nbsp;are helping him move. John was telling me he felt bad because they had just helped him move to North Carolina and now he was back

We move some wicker chairs and take a break. I'm sitting in one of the chairs in the living room playing with my phone. Because its a dream and therefore magical-I can see that his ex-gf has my phone number and is calling me &quot;lame&quot; and talking shit about me. He gets mad at me because I&nbsp;found that out-and tells me she needed my phone number. 

C-WHY?&nbsp;Why give an ex your current gf's phone number?
J-BC, shes a friend-she might need the number
C-I am SO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;OKAY&nbsp;WITH&nbsp;THAT!

So I&nbsp;storm out, for some reason my car is parked facing the house in the street rather than parallel (which would be the legal way to park) and I&nbsp;get in, John comes out in his Fox uniform and tries to get in the passenger but its locked. He comes to the drivers side window and I&nbsp;say &quot;let me go&quot;. He says &quot;okay!&quot; and walks away. As I'm driving i&nbsp;send him a text saying &quot;im coming back, lets settle what needs to be settled and be done with this&quot; He doesnt answer and now im in a garage with Josh and Earnastine from work. I&nbsp;call John and ask if he got my text. He says &quot;yea-the one where you love me and want to work this out?&quot; and I go &quot;NO! the one where I&nbsp;said lets be done! You stand up for your fucking ex and not your gf-thats such bullshit-does she know that you're not over her?&quot; I&nbsp;continue screaming for awhile. 

Then I&nbsp;woke up...to John texting me.

The night before-he gave me a little trouble-because i&nbsp;kept unlocking the truck and he kept locking it-so&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to make up a story to get into the truck and fill it with balloons and an &quot;I&nbsp;love you&quot; hanger, then birthday garland and sparkle 4 leaf clovers, and bows (I was lucky that Valentines day and St. Pattys day were close enough for there to be decorations available). 

In the afternoon we went to lunch at Margeritas, then a bead store and Twisted Shamrock (the kids 99% irish-what can I say?)-then we went back to his place for some alone time...and then we headed out to his grandmas house in Romeo...it was funny-he was napping and we got there and he looks up and goes &quot;uh-why did you go to my grandmas house?&quot; His mum showed up from Flint, his brother showed up from Kalamazoo-it was awesome. We spent the night on the air mattress-and someone was a shameless blanket thief....

Then we went back to his dads-and it was snowing crazy-we went to Shields Pizza for dinner and Cindy told me to stay the night-so we went back and had cake and ice cream-and watched tv. 

My family missed me like crazy....

So I&nbsp;came home in the afternoon-and I slept for like 5 hours-made dinner-watched tv with my mum-some fun stuff/

I&nbsp;declared today a &quot;wellness day&quot;-I'm taking the whole day off-no school-no work-no obligations. Just a day to recharge.

I got a really bad feeling driving down 94-there were 6 accidents- 4 of them were cars in ditches-and each and every one of them-the car was turned around facing the wrong way. Facing oncoming traffic. And I&nbsp;kind of felt like that was a metaphor for my life-right now I feel like I'm facing oncoming traffic-and I'll get through it...its just a matter of time.

"event","So I&nbsp;realized the other day I&nbsp;want to get back into theatre. I love acting.

Then I realized-I'm in theatre. Every day. So few people know me. Even people who would swear they do.

My job is all about acting. I&nbsp;noticed that I have a certain face that gets put on-a mask-while I'm working. And i don't even feel like I'm acting like the person in front of me is the most important thing in my life-that their joy is my top priority. I&nbsp;can keep it up for hours without breaking character.

But when I&nbsp;get in my car and I'm away from the public-the mask comes off-I&nbsp;take a deep breath and close my eyes. Performance over. And it's tiring-but no more than any job is. I'm in the right profession-because I can keep it up without burning out.

Even when I was off the clock yesterday walking to my car in the parking structure. This woman looked at me and smiled-and instantly my mask was back on-my &quot;Can I help you?&quot; face. And that's when I&nbsp;realized how easy it was for me to slip into it. How natural it felt-and how staged at the same time.

I&nbsp;can go in everyday and act like my life revolves around these people-because for a few hours-it does. I&nbsp;can act like I&nbsp;don't have a life away from these people-because for a few hours-I don't. 

I always said I'd never be one of those women who puts her career before love and family. But now I realize I'd be happy to do that. It was always a possibility that I'd be leaving the state at the end of my schooling...why? For my job. Because I&nbsp;absolutely love what I&nbsp;do.

I was on the phone with my grandma earlier-and she asked me a question and I&nbsp;said &quot;yes ma'am.&quot; I say that (and &quot;yes sir&quot;) a lotttttt. 

Oh well. 

Was supposed to be seeing John today-but i have noooo clue whats going on.

Mel calls him Phelps because they have decided to sleep together and she has slept with enough Jasons-so she asked if she could call him something else...he said okay!

So we decide we are going to throw him out of the truck-and get Marcus to back up over him...vicious crew really...and now that Ipods are banned-the catchphrase come from Ravon who when told to take the ipod out of his ears-said 'its not an ipod' and put the headphones back in his ears and walk away...so now everyone is saying &quot;its not an ipod&quot;

Going back to the hall-we all load up in the truck and&nbsp;J got in back-he was actually nervous...but we didn't throw him out of the truck-and so he said to marcus &quot;I&nbsp;wasn't scared-they're just females-you know how they is-all talk...&quot; Marcus looks at us and says to him &quot;you'd better run...&quot;"

A few days ago Wizzo told me that since nice guys finish last he is going to start being an asshole-and we had this heart to heart ( through text....haha) and I&nbsp;told him that I wish he wouldnt-he's one of the last sweet guys around-and he was like-isnt that what the ladies like? I was like-no-and the ones who do-is that really who you want to attract? 

Well obviously there was no good answer for that

So at work today he asked if i did his bracelet

C-No-I&nbsp;figured I'd see how this asshole thing went and see if I needed to stop talking to you
J-for real?
C-Yeah...you going to be an ass I ain't going to talk to you
J-that makes it worse-if you're not being nice...
C-If I ain't talking to you I dont care if your being an asshole to other people
J-Oh-okay-I guess
C-I'll have your bracelet once I&nbsp;get the string.

And later he was texting me

J-How I&nbsp;been acting?
C-I aint really talked to you much
J-Yeah you have
C-You been nice
J-I'll justbe nice to you, since you do be nice to me. how about that?
C--Ok I&nbsp;like that.

And I&nbsp;got a big hug-and we may be going back to Saugautuck on Sunday

Rachel was like-you guys have the weirdest relationship...yeah i know-we're crazy friends...

Made more jewelry today- i rock hard at it.

I got all sorts of compliments on my earrings today :-)

And had tons of fun with pat-a few weeks ago she was so frazzled-I&nbsp;was like &quot;Pat do you need a hug?&quot; and she put her hand up and was like &quot;Maybe later-not now&quot; and later she was doing her report and me and rachel were hovering and she goes-Carol-shhh be quiet.

And today she forgot to put me on the sheet (i tried sneaking off to go home but Carissa caught me) and Pat was like-I&nbsp;didnt do it on purpose-though you probably think I&nbsp;did cuz I&nbsp;told you to be quiet. 

And didn't give me a&nbsp; hug!!!&nbsp;

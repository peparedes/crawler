My manga downloads have been temporarily ceased because of lack of memory space. But Janna promised to give me more manga scans if I get an external mem. Goal!

By the way, I would just like to point out the power of anime's influence. After completing Ouran's series, Mafel and I have decided to hold a celebration of our debut wherein guests will be asked to cross dress. It will be so much fun! Tuxes and vests! I doubt this would actually happen, though. I'd sleep all off my obsession come 2 AM. But I mentioned it here anyway because it's such a happy thought.

Oyasumi!"

Let me rave about Prince of Tennis. I will be brief though. I need only emphasize four main points.

<lj-cut text=""Mada Mada Dane"">Mada Mada Dane

TEZUKA! The insanely cautious captain of Seigaku is the tennis god of this series. Everybody and I mean, everybody looks up to him. Seigaku regulars, sports journalists, onlookers, even his opponents. Despite a broken elbow that unfailingly hinders him from displaying his true potential, he was able to amass such a reputation. He had to go to Germany to fix his ailment and so everyone had to endure a tremendous wait for his return. Seriously, it was like the Jews waiting for their Messiah to appear. He did go back, at one point, to act as coach for the Invitational Camp when Ryuzaki fell sick. Naturally, some of the members doubted his skill as coach since he is only a junior high school student. In order to prove otherwise, he was forced to have a match with all the doubting Peters in his team. Oishi tried to insist on stopping the match because his elbow has not yet fully healed at that time. However, Tezuka told him that the doctor allowed him to have matches if he only returned balls with light swings. You could imagine how indignant his opponent was. He was invited as a player for the camp. How could Tezuka possibly win against him if he kept using light swings? Of course, Tezuka proved everybody wrong in the end. All the non-believers gave up on their match the moment Tezuka scored a point.

Tezuka is the only one who could motivate the aces of Rikkaidai and Hyotei to battle it out just to prove who is his rightful rival. Can you imagine inventing new techniques, developing your stamina, swinging your racket a hundred times, running ten or more laps, and having practice matches daily just so you could reserve the right to fight with someone else?

And who else but a deity could induce Sanada to sing Wonderful Days, a boyband song, in front of an audience in a welcome back party, and Atobe to oblige a request that required him to lower his overbearing ego to train a regular which defeated his team? Nobody else but our bespectacled straight-faced green-haired Seigaku captain. The real pillar of support, in my opinion.

Somebody build a monument for this guy.

FUJI-baby! The most adorable tennis prodigy ever to be created in the two dimensional realm. The man of smiles and calm exterior. The man who rarely shows weightiness and true potential yet manages to win. The man able to withstand the toxicity of Inui juice. The man angered by threats to his friends and family, most especially to his younger brother, Yuuta. The man who looks stunning in a red dress and hat. My description for Fuji might comparatively short but thats because Fuji-baby is just too cute for words.

If you are a close friend of mine, you should have seen this coming... TEZUKA/FUJI! It's incredibly blatant! From the very first time I watched Prince of Tennis, I knew this pairing existed and would blossom into one of those which I would include to my to-die-for-pairings list. They are so suited for each other, the tennis prodigy and the tennis god. I loved their showdown! I had to call Niki up so I could obsess with her. Lots of pretty flashbacks showcasing their alone moments in the locker room, on their way home, and in the tennis court.

Fuji actually got mad at Tezuka in their first year when he agreed on having a match with him when he knew his wrist was injured. Tezuka even apologized to Fuji for his behavior. Allow me to repeat that. Tezuka apologized to Fuji. That was the only instance you will see Tezuka saying sorry to anyone. In turn, it was only Tezuka who was able to bring out the Fuji's full potential in a tennis game. That is true love. Oh, and hello? Fuji was the first person Tezuka told his decision to go to Germany to. See, they exemplified the rule that couples should tell everything to their better half.

The chibi episodes were so precious to me. The cowboy one was a gift from heaven. Fuji in a fluffy red dress, and Tezuka with his Matrix maneuvers. They were like Bonnie and Clyde. Fuji, the Gunman's accomplice, came to be rescued by Tezuka, the sought for Gunman. The Tenpuri one was also adorable. Tezuka as grandfather and Fuji as grandmother. Fuji actually called Tezuka ""sweetheart"" there! So endearing.

Did you notice the airplane flying around during Fuji and Kirihara's fight? It was like a hint in a bright blinking yellow lights screaming ""Tezuka is my source of inspiration and strength! He is what keeps me going on despite my knee injury!"" Tachibana, you flirt! You are nothing more than a fling! Know your place! You can never surpass the god and lover that is Tezuka!

Finally, the ENDING SUCKS. I was so frustrated after watching the final episode. It even dampened my good mood after watching the Fuji vs. Tezuka fight. See how evil it is? It was completely obvious that Ryoma only beat Tezuka because he was the lead character. They didn't even show the details of the game! I mean, usually, a match would span two or three episodes because they would show how shots would defeat techniques which would cause a player to grasp triumph in a game. But in that fight, Ryoma just kept on delivering the ball. They barely showed Tezuka receiving them. This leads to a very sound conclusion. It is NOT possible for Tezuka to lose. Animators could not find a logical way for Ryoma to defeat Tezuka but they had to let him win because producers say that's how the ending is supposed to be. So they came up with a crappy episode which showed Ryoma's victory without any explanation on how it occurred.

Did I say I was going to be brief?</lj-cut text>

<lj-cut text=""Things I Heart About Bleach List"">
Things I Heart About Bleach List

I heart Ichimaru Gin and Rangiku Matsumoto! Grabe, kapag wala silang love scene, magwawala ako. Tell me those boobs aren't there for nothing. I miss seeing Gin after whole filler arc with those Bounto. I missed his foxy smile and the way he lets Rangiku have her way. For instance...

Gin: Are you sure you wanna dodge that?
Hitsugaya: Hinamori!
Rangiku intercepts Gin's Zanpakutou
Rangiku: If you continue to fight, then I will be your opponent from here on
Gin leaves

Gin sees Aizen get cornered by Soi Fon and Yoruichi
Gin: What should I do?
Rangiku grabs hold of Gin's wrist
Gin: I've been caught
A dialogue ensues about Aizen's seeming helplessness
A beam of light (forgot what it was called) transports Aizen and his subordinates to Hueco Mundo
Gin: If only you had held on to me a bit longer... I'm sorry

I love them. That is my major pairing for Bleach. My minor ones include Ichigo/Rukia/Renji, Ishida/Nemu, Byakuya/Ukitake, Kyouraku/Ukitake, etc. I love to mix and match.

I heart Kuchiki Byakuya because he is:
1) an aristocrat
2) rich (a corollary of reason #1)
3) insanely powerful (I love his lethal sakura blossoms)
4) a big brother (made me go aw to the nth degree when he got pierced by Gin's Zanpakutou after saving Rukia and when he went after Kariya after on of his subordinates tried to kill Rukia)
5) damn hot

I heart Hitsugaya Toushirou. The kid prodigy who snatched one of the craved for captain titles without having any formal Shinigami training. He is such a hot guy when in casual clothes. I love his devotion to Hinamori but I do not want Hinamori to end up with him. That weak spirited brat should have nothing to do with him.

I heart Urahara Kisuke. The former 12th squad captain and founder of the Bureau of Technology who achieved Bankai in three days and claims to be a ""handsome innocent store keeper"". Very cute when he dons his striped green hat. Very hot when shown with his white captain coat. A genius.

I heart Shohouin Yoruichi. The former Commander of the Secret Mobile Corps and 2nd squad captain who is able to shift from a cat to naked woman form. The reigning and unbeatable Goddess of Flash despite eluding combat for a century.

Generally, I just heart all the Shinigamis because each of them have their own unique skills and personality. Their wacky antics never fail to amuse me.

I even heart Quincy dude, Ishida, but I heart Daddy Ishida even more. Especially so when he told his son the reason why he gave up his Quincy powers... They don't make money. There is capitalism in the spiritual realm!

I even heart the minor characters such as Jinta, Ururu, Yuzu, Karin, Kon, Nova (whose gigai is unusually hot) etc. Filler episodes about them don't become boring because they have their own humor. Makes it still very fun to watch.

Maybe this list would have been shorter if I just enumerated the things I don't like. Let me be precise. The person I don't like. Yes, note the singularity.

I despise Orihime Inoue. I have mentioned this before and I will do so again. Die, die, die. The biggest mistake Bleach animators could ever commit is to make her end up with Ichigo. That would be outrageous! As outrageous as the kind of reasoning the 21,000 had when they voted for Victor Wood. As outrageous as pickled fish and asparagus served with parfait. As outrageous as the thought of me becoming a vegetarian. As outrageous as Niki Razon's ""flattening bra"". Okay, now I've proved my point.</lj-cut text>

And there is also <lj-cut text=""Death Note"">Death Note

I love the intellectual battle between Yagami Light and L. It's like they have each other by the neck so they are forced to really think of a plan to outsmart each other. The clever schemes... Not to mention the yaoi. Never fails to light up my bulb. It gets dreary after L dies, though. It was him who pushed Light to really think. In my opinion, Near and Mellow, L's successors, are not much of a challenge for Light. Aside from that, L provides all the dry humor.

L: Thanks for showing me this place.
Light: And nobody's going to be staring at you for sitting like that.
L: I just can not sit any other way than this. If I sit the way other people do, my reasoning ability drops by forty percent.

Light (to his father): I swore that if anything happened to you, I'd make sure Kira got the death penalty
L: (thinking) It's hard to believe this is just an act. I mean, if it is an act, it's just way too corny.

Misa: Why do you like eating sweets? They make you fat.
L: If you use your head, then you won't get fat even if you eat sweets.


Matsuda: Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do to help? Besides the manager job?
L: You want to be useful?
Matsuda: Yes!
L: Then go get me some coffee.

And of course, his killer line: I am L. Woooooh!

Also, evil Light is hot.</lj-cut text>

The return to my manga downloading habits. I should stop myself before I blow up my laptop to tiny pieces. The poor thing is so overused. Remaining Memory: 10 GB. *sigh* I must really buy myself an external memory. Problem is, it's way too expensive and my money keeps going doooown the drain.

My eardrums hurt from the badabing-badabooms outside and the, as usual, incessant crowing aka Magic Sing-ing of my neighbors. Now, I must depart.

Okay lang. Masarap naman matulog at kumain. At manood ng NU Rock Awards at MTV HIV Music Summit. Ang galing. Nanalo si Gabby Alipe ng Vocalist of the Year. Ang cute niya. Para talaga siyang si Winnie the Pooh. Dapat magtabi sila ni Resyo kasi kamuhka niya si Eeyore. At crush ko na talaga ulit si Miguel Chavez. Kaya lang sana hindi siya nagmemake-up kasi dati mukha naman siyang grunge kahit na di niya subukan. Sana hindi maging mainstream ang Chicosci.

Heeeeeeeeniwey, gusto ko talaga ng Big Bang... at ng maligayang Pasko kaya aalis na ako at magpapakabundat sa hamon at pasta.

Happy Feet! Heart. In my seventeen years of existence, I have never seen more adorable tap dancing penguins. The macho and flirtatious yet pygmy penguins which comprised The Amigos were hilarious. Jom, if you are reading this, take a lesson from Ramon and let this be your pick-up line:

<i>I know size can be daunting but... I love you.</i> Haha. Winner.

I also LOVE the soundtrack. The mix of the songs, especially of the 80's, were so hip and fresh. Jump N' Move is stuck in my head, and I have been flapping my appendages ever since the movie ended. I liked the Kiss/Heartbreak Hotel mix. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman sang it. Hugh Jackman. Imagine Wolverine singing Kiss, dear me. But, I must say, he sings pretty well. It's somewhat odd to hear him speaking with a Southern accent, though. Hugo Weaving lent his voice to the leader elder character (forgot his name, minor role) but I failed to recognize it. 

To everyone who read this: WATCH HAPPY FEET!

<u>Spoiler!</u> Namatay si Mumbles at nagpakasal si Gloria sa ibang penguin. Yes, life is unfair. Disney has its cutsey wutsey way of easing that atrocious fact to children.


<lj-cut text=""Tsk tsk, Disney"">
Uy siyempre yung mga nakabasa ng spoiler magrereact kaagad... magcocomment.

Joke lang! Masarap lang mang trip.

Hindi namatay si Mumbles at nagkatuluyan sila ni Gloria. Sinabi pa nga ni Gloria na di niya raw narinig ang heart song ng boy/penguinlet niya eh. Kaya di siya nag-asawa at nagpakakunat sa pagtuturo ng blues. Siyempre natuwa si Mumbles. Mokong talaga yun. Oportunista! </lj-cut text>

Have you seen ANNA MOLLY? Did you see how big Brandon Boyd's biceps were? If my eyes did not deceive me, they were bigger than Jose's. Homegad. I don't know if I should be happy or not, though. Maskels = more fafable points. On the other hand, I kind of like his lean surfer body. Which suits him better? I never thought that thinking of chiseled arms and torsos could be agonizing. Haha. Feelers.

Moving to another recently shown video... FUTURE by Dictalicense and Urbandub. Two of the greatest modern OPM bands in one song. Kick ass. Oh, and I think I may be developing a minor crush on Miguel Chavez and his smirk. Or I may have been releasing excess hormones as a result of ovulation. *noid* And I saw A PROMISE in MYX, the ultimate music channel which has an uncanny ability to strip my interests in a rock band,and popularize wanna-be-rock-musicians. Be afraid. Be <i>very</i> afraid. I hope Chicosci does not become like one of those typical bands claiming to be epitomes of OPM Rock. 
To those bands: How dare you? You have smudged and spoiled the legacy of OPM Rock as set by Eraserheads, Yano, Siakol, Teeth and other legendary combos of the 90's.

"event","A short story by Frank Stockton entitled The Lady or the Tiger? provoked many to ask... Love or jealousy? The key to the nature of the human heart lies in the answer to this question. This inquiry has beleaguered the minds of many philosophers for decades but there is still no definite resolution to such debates. At the end of the story, Stockton inquires as to which creature came out of the right door but in reality, he poses a deeper query to readers. Is it more innate for man to be perturbed of social welfare rather than pursue his own survival unconcerned with the needs of others? Do we reserve our applause for Rousseau? Or do we owe Hobbes a pat on the back?

I think that the princess pointed the man to his bloody end because 1) She is semibarbaric. Her instincts are more primal meaning that she is more likely to look out for herself. So it's her or the fangs of the tiger. And I understand completely. Which is more grievous? Failing to attain something because it is non-existent or eternally groping for an object already snatched away? It's like waving a piece of Black Forest Cake in front of a Christelle restricted by chains. It's absolute and utter torture. Damnation to the nth degree. 2) Only the idea of love exists. It can never be embodied. We, humans, just attempt to love the same way we strive for perfection. We move towards it but we can never truly exemplify it. So love only persists in fiction. But let's see. Then it is possible for the princess to choose the lady since she is only fictional! There you have it, lovestruck masses! The princess prefers to lift her status from semibarbarian to saint. Her noble deed nestles a golden halo on her head and immortalizes her in the mind of her subjects. But if that really is her motive, then it would be still for self-benefit, not true love. So yeah. Whatever she chooses, her drive would always be of self-profit. Kudos to Hobbes!"

It seemed as if it was one of the many writings of my overprotective boy-hating father. Or maybe my father and Niki's co-wrote it. Readers will get what I mean when they read it.

<lj-cut text=""Ten Rules to Date My Daughter"">
<b>Ten Rules to Date My Daughter</b>

<b>Rule One</b>
If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a 
package, because you're sure not picking anything up.

<b>Rule Two</b>
You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, 
so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot 
keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove 
them.

<b>Rule Three</b>
I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to 
wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off 
their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of 
your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open 
minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come 
to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too 
big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your 
clothes do not, infact come off during the course of you date with 
my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your 
trousers securely in place to your waist.

<b>Rule Four</b>
I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without 
utilizing a ""Barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me 
elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrrier, and I will kill 
you. 
<i>In my father's case, one sumo jump is all it takes to cause the earth to part and swallow you whole.</i>

<b>Rule Five</b>
It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each 
other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of 
the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from 
you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely 
back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject 
is: ""early"" 

<b>Rule Six</b>
I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to 
date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my 
daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you 
will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. 
If you make her cry, I will make you cry. 

<b>Rule Seven</b>
As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, 
and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want 
to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter 
is putting on her makeup, a process than can take longer than 
painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why 
don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car? 

<b>Rule Eight</b>
The following places are not appropriate for a date with my 
daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer 
than a wooden tool. Places where there is darkness. Places where 
there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the 
ambient temperature is warm enough to introduce my daughter to wear 
shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than 
overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka - zipped up to her 
throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be 
avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are 
okay. Old folks homes are better.

<b>Rule Nine</b>
Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-
aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I 
am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you 
where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me 
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a 
shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. 
<i>Haha. Loved this one. The description kind of applies. *thankful that my parents are clueless about computers and internet*</i>

<b>Rule Ten</b>
Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake 
the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a 
rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the 
voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for 
you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the 
driveways you should exit the car with both hands in plain sight. 
Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you 
have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your 
car - there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face 
at the window is mine. 
<i>For some profound reason, I think my father's likely to do that.</i>

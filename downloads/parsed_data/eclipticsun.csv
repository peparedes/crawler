That once we said goodbye
No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me
I'm still driving away
And I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live...
Not stopping...

It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you

You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here I'm now I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine

Amazing still it seems
I'll be 23
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets

You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here I'm now I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end

-The kids still haven't found me a slump-buster, I'm wondering if that would be a good idea right now anyway... any takers??

"event","So, Kory leaves for Seattle on Monday, where he'll be training until around December.  Hey may come home for a couple days, or they may just ship them off to Iraq right then.  Either way, I'm not going to see my brother until sometime between 12/06 and 02/07.  Obviously this sucks because he's the one person in my family that I'm closest to, and now he's going to war.  :/  I'm honestly trying to be as optimistic (Kate tell me if I spelled that right) as possible, but it's hard when a friend of the family just died there about a year and a half ago, and now my brother's leaving.  But at least he'll be able to tell me how awesome Washington is, that way I'll want to move up there even more.

It's interesting, someone asked me the other day whether I was an optimist, or a pessimist, and I told her I was a realist.  I notice that there are good and bad things that happen in the world, but instead of hoping for the best or dreading the worst, I just see things how they are based on my perceptions.  I'm not quite sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  I figure it can't be that good, because instead of trying to make my dreams come true, I just make do with what I have.  But at the same time, I never really get my hopes up about anything...I should work on that...


call if you're bored, I'm up all night because I had to work for someone, and I'm sure I'll be bored as hell.

"event","I hate heartburn so much.  I get it at least once a day, for maybe an hour.  But it really seems to get me when I work graveyard.  I could have a few chips, and it acts up for the rest of the night.  I'm assuming it's because my system is trying to relax and revive itself, like most bodies do during the sleeping hours, but with me staying up, it screws that up.  Only two more nights of this crap, and I'm done with ATSS.  Now, I just have to wait for Countrywide to call me and say, ""You start on this date,_____.""  I really don't know when that's going to happen.  I've been told by multiple sources that I have the job, I just don't know when it begins.  That's fine for now, it just means more hours at the pool.

Man, I love working at the pool.  It's so nice being in a management position.  It's good to know that the guards I work with respect me enough because I've worked side by side with them before, that they'll listen to me when I tell them to do something.  Plus, it's awesome not having to teach as much.  

I really want to do this trip up the west coast, but I'm not sure if my money situation is going to be tight or not.  I just think it would be so cool to see so many places that I have yet to visit.  I guess we'll see."

I'm in a pretty good mood, because I'm fairly awake.  Usually I'm dragging by now.  I think it's because I actually went home and took a nap this afternoon.  A much needed nap.  

I got the job with Countrywide.  That means no more security for me.  It was fun while it lasted.  There have been many ups and downs with this company, but everyone that has made this job somewhat enjoyable has left, besides Ben.  It makes things a little difficult to deal with, especially since all the new hires are between the ages of 18 and 18 1/2.  I'm just ready for a change in atmosphere as well as a change in pay.  I'll be working less hours and getting the same amount a month that I do now.  Plus, the work I will be doing will make the time seem to fly by.  

School is not looking too hot, but that's something that I'm working out.

My car has really become a hassle.  Not so much with driving, but more with trying to finance it.  I think I've just taken on way too many changes at once, so they're all bogging me down a bit.  But, I'm hoping that things will pick up soon."

I know some people are sick of hearing about it(some people meaning Ben) but I'm excited.  It's a 2005 Ford Focus.  It's awesome.  I do miss my other car though.  It was hard to part ways, considering it was my first car, but I'm excited to have something this cool.

Anyway, I thought I'd share."

"event","Well, last night was an experience.  After hanging out with Stephanie at Starbucks, I went over to Paul's for a bit.  Ben called me and asked me if I wanted to go to a party, so I went home to get ready for said party.  I asked Ben where the party was and who it was for.  He said he had no idea who had invited him, but that it was in BFE.  No joke.  We actually drove to Butt-Fu#$ing Egypt, with pyramids and everything....actually it was Fountain Hills, but it was close enough.  So, we get to the party, which consisted of 10 people, including ourselves and realize that the guy who had invited Ben went to my birthday party last week.  The funny thing is, neither one of us really knows who he is.  Luckily, Cam was there with a friend, so we started talking to him, and apparently he didn't know who the kid was either.  But we all enjoyed ourselves, laughing at how young some of them were acting.  

So, around 3am, Ben and I decide to head home.  Well, the birthday girl asked us where we lived and then proceeded to ask her friend if he wanted us to take them home.  Ben and I just kind of looked at each other with a, ""Why is she volunteering us?"" kind of glance.  We tried to duck out of there before a decision was made, but we were stuck.  The girl was too drunk to drive her own car, so her, her friend, and Ben went in her car while I drove by myself.  I later picked Ben up at where he dropped them off.  I don't think we'll be hanging out with them again anytime ever.

When we got home, neither one of us could really go to sleep, so we stayed up watching a movie until he went to work.  I went to bed at 5:30 only to get up at 8:30 to have brunch with my family for mothers' day.  And now, I'm at work, having a wonderful time being extremely bored.  

I know I keep saying it, but I really need to get on the ball with the whole firefighting thing.  I've talked to other people who are either EMTs or Firefighters, and most of them are either my age or younger.  I feel like I haven't really accomplished anything as far as my life goes.  I need to get out of this crappy job.

Your birth on the 25th day of the month (7 energy) modifies your life path by giving you some special interest in technical, scientific, or other complex and often hard to understand subjects. 

You may become something of a perfectionist and a stickler for details. 

Your thinking is logical and intuitive, rational and responsible. 



Your feelings may run deep, but you are not very likely to let them show. 

This birthday makes you a more private person, more introspective and perhaps more inflexible. 

In friendships you are very cautious and reserved. 

You are probably inventive, and given to unique approaches and solutions.</td>

"event","I'm tired.  Just sitting at work, watching the hours roll by, feeling like I'm wasting time.  Sure, I get paid, but for nothing really.  Just to be a body for people to feel ""safe"".  Eh, it's lame.  And only 4 more hours to go.  

I'm ready for this party, but I have a few reservations about it.  First off, I don't know if my check is going to go through tonight or Monday, so I don't know if I'm going to be able to fund it.  Secondly, I think there are going to be a lot of people there.  That makes me happy, but being the worrier that I am, I'm afraid the cops are going to get called.  Ben keeps telling me to not worry about it and he'll take care of everything, but I still feel like that's my job.  I guess we'll just see what happens.

I'll post more later..."

"event","So, I decided to switch a couple of my shifts to graveyard.  It's crazy, I know, but it'll let me do more during the day, considering I'm usually up late at night anyway.  

I've been talking to one of the guards here; he's from Portugal, and he's been telling me all about their way of life out there.  I'm jealous.  They can come into work whenever they want, stay for a few hours, go take a two hour lunch or nap, go back to work for a few more hours, and then head out to dinner and the clubs at like midnight until 6 in the morning.  What a carefree life.  That's how things should be, not worrying about everything being exactly at a specific time, just enjoying life as it goes.  I think a lot of the stress that Americans have would be relieved if they just relaxed about being everywhere at an exact time.  

I have so many things that I want to do this summer, but so much that I have to get done.  I'm working two jobs, and perhaps taking a summer class.  (fingers crossed)  But I want to take a trip out to Hawai'i.  I miss my cousins, and I've never been out there.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  I'm definitely doing the road trip, as long as Ben is willing to go with me.  I want to take a trip up the west coast, stopping at certain cities along the way.  Of course, the second most important reason for this trip is to see if Seattle(or Vancouver) is really where I want to live.  

More importantly though, this trip would be a last hoorah for Ben and I to take before he moves.  I hope it works out.  If anyone wants to send some money to the Help Joel With His Car/Hawai'i Trip/West Coast Trip Fund, that would be greatly appreciated."

"event","That's right kids, you guessed it, it's that time of year again when Joel gets a little older, a lot creakier, and not that much wiser.

Today's been a pretty good day.  I've been getting phone calls or text messages from people non-stop, which definitely lets me know how much my friends appreciate me, and makes me appreciate my friends all that much more.  The only thing that has sucked is that I've been at work most of the day, so I haven't been able to either answer my phone, or call people back.  So, if you called and I didn't get back to you:  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME.

And for those who didn't call...I probably deserved it because I most likely forgot to call you on your birthday.  To which I say, I'm sorry.

I've felt really tired all day long, no good reason for it either.  But I really want to go out tonight.  Maybe not to get lit up or anything, but it would be nice to sit down with some close friends and have a drink or five.  If anyone's willing, let me know.

With all that being said, thanks again to everyone for their love and I hope you had a wonderful day."

"event","So, I'm going to set up an appointment with my guidance counselor tomorrow to figure out what my options are for school.  I know that I'm going to fail my classes, which will bring my GPA below the minimum standard, so I need to find out if I'll be kicked out, or if I'll just be on a probationary period.  What really sucks, is that I may be in for longer than another year.  I'm an idiot for letting this happen like it has, but I'm working through it the best I can right now.

If my schedule for next semester stays the way I have it planned, I'm going to see if I can get the Sergeant position for the new Tempe building, and I'll work the graveyard shift.  That way, my classes will go until 1:30 at the latest, I'll go home and sleep, and then get up and go to work at 10:30 at night.  Kind of a screwy schedule, but it works.  

I'm also going to try and fit in an EMT class at GCC with my already going to be hectic life.  I figure, it's about time I get on the ball with what I want to do with my life, instead of wasting time getting nowhere at a horrible job.

I've noticed that lately, my philosophy on anything has been, ""Cut your losses and move on.""  Whether that works in every situation, I don't know, but it seems to have worked so far.  There's really no point in dwelling on the past, what didn't happen, or what did.  You can't go back, you can't change it, and there's no chance for growth if you keep looking behind instead of forward.  I've done some stupid things in my life, but it's not worth worrying about if I'm not learning anything from it.  I just want to live the life I have ahead of me the best I can, and hope that the decisions I make in the future help me and others if the situation permits."

"event","I made spaghetti!!!  Look at me go.  I'm a regular chef.  Riiiiiight.  But it has definitely sparked a desire to eat healthier and actually cook things.  Not to mention I'm going rock climbing later.  That's my exercise ritual from now on.  Not only does it work all of my muscles together, but it's an aerobic work out as well.  Look at me trying to be healthy and what not.  

So, I started the mental activities, i.e. going to class and studying.  Now, I'm beginning the physical...next up, spirituality baby.  Maybe I'll actually get to go to church this Sunday.  


Pray for me.

"event","Today, was an alright day.  I spent most of it either reading or doing laundry.  Apparently our apartment complex has decided that tomorrow would be a good time to come and make sure all the washers and dryers are working, so I need to clean everything.  At least the kitchen and living room.  If they came into my room, I'd be pissed.


I was hoping that Ben would get back from FSN in time so that we could go work out before he went to work, but apparently it's taking longer than he had expected.  All I know is that if I'm going to be lifeguarding/managing (and picking up all the hot babes...chuckle) this summer, I need to get cut.  

I'm done for now."

"event","So, I finally decide that I need to just force myself to get to class, thanks Lindsey for the pep talk.  Well, unfortunately, even with going to bed at 11:30, I missed my first class.  No biggy, considering that 2 out of 3 ain't bad.  So, I show up a few minutes late for my second class, better late than never, and then I'm off to my last class of the day.  I sit down and no one else is there yet.  I think, ""This is odd."", but decide that they're all taking their sweet time.  So, I decide to take out my syllabi for my classes and write down what chapters I have to read.  I get through my COM 100 and there's only a couple of chapters, not too bad.  Then I get to my GPH (Geography, the class that I was sitting in at the time) scroll down to today's date and read, ""NO CLASS THIS WEEK, INSTRUCTOR WILL BE AT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS MEETINGS IN DENVER, READ AHEAD AND GET SMARTER.""  Now, don't I feel like a dumbass.  Out of the 3 classes that I was going to go to today, one I didn't show up, another I was late for, and the last was cancelled....so much for getting into gear and actually doing well today.  

I've also got work in an hour and 1/2.  Not looking forward to that.

And then there's this weekend; consisting of Cameron's soccer game 8-12, and then hanging out with Paul afterwards.  This all happening on Saturday.  Sunday consists of church, yes I'm going to go, for the love of God I need to go.  And then back to work again.  Oh, what fun.


If there was one thing I could do over again, it would be college.  I don't feel like a college student, and I haven't since I've been here.  I don't know if it's because I didn't go to all the football games, or because I didn't live in the dorms, or maybe it's because I don't get drunk the night before class, go to bed, and wake up still drunk and head to class.  I don't know, I feel like a boring individual.  I try to have fun, but without money, it's hard to do that.  Yeah, there are things that you can do that don't cost money, but not a lot of things are like that, and gas costs money too.  


Hmmmm....I don't like who I've become."

A little rusty, buy enjoyable nonetheless.  We then proceeded to our apartment, where we all played a few drinking games, Chris got hammered, and I made a drunk dial.  It's always fun doing that.  It was definitely not the best night to be doing that, considering it was a Sunday and I had class the next morning, but it was fun.

Hopefully this Friday will be just as fun.  I'm excited for Ben's show, but I know that we need to get on the ball technically if we're to get this set up.  Less than a week left, and the lights aren't even set, just like professional theatre.

There are so many things going on this April.  I don't understand why they all have to be planned at the same time.  I just hope I can get to them all.

He's really excited, because he feels like if he's going to be part of the military, that he should actually be doing something, but for obvious reasons, I would much rather him not go.  He's going to be part of the security forces for convoys, VIP's, and something that I don't recall, because I don't really care to at the moment.  It's bad enough that I had to lose my grandma a year ago, as well as Randy's brother, who Kory and I both knew...but if I lose my brother...I don't know what I'd do.  

You know, I've heard that gambling is a bad thing from some people, but if you think about it, we gamble with our lives everyday.  Not necessarily jeopardizing whether we live or die, but more so the course that our lives are going to take.  I find it difficult to agree with people when they say, ""God has a plan for us all.""  If God had a plan for us, how do we have free will???  You can't be making your own decisions and choosing your own path, if someone has laid out the tracks that you're going to follow.  Now, don't get me wrong, I feel that if you ask God for help, he will point you in the right direction.  Much like a compass, but I don't feel he changes which way you're going to go unless you ask.

Sorry, that was a random tangent that I just thought about...maybe not as random as I thought, considering I've been thinking about my life lately and how I'm always confused by it.  It's amazing how most people will comment on goofy quizzes, but when it comes to deep down stuff that truly affects our lives, not many people know what to say...I wonder if it's because people are either afraid to say something that might make the other person feel hurt, or if they just don't want to get that deep into someone else's life.  I mean, we all have enough on our own plates, why would we want to take on anymore.  Let's all just be civil and feign happiness, and live a lie.

I'm sorry, this is really depressing.  As you can tell, I'm not in the best of moods.</lj-cut>

I should know what I want from life, and should instead, be learning how to achieve those goals.

"event","Man o man has this been a long weekend...and it's going to get even longer.  With 9 hours of sleep Saturday, split between two different times of day, and 3 hours last night, I'm just a wee bit tired.  Plus, I told Ben that I would work his graveyard tonight, which means I'm finally pulling a back to back double, until 6:30, class at 9:40-12:30, and then work again from 2-10:30.  Hey Ben, it sounds like I'm turning into you.  Maybe I should start calling myself Big Joel...maybe not.  Let's just say, come Monday, I'm not going to be a happy camper...but Tuesday's looking good.

So, Vegas...I had a blast.  Once we got there, we got ready and went to a club called Ra.  It's located inside the Luxor, which is where we stayed, so we didn't have to walk very far.  I got pretty blitzed and proceeded to not dance with anyone because I can't dance worth crap.  Afterwards, we went to play some blackjack, and I won $25.  Not too bad for being still a little tipsy and playing in Vegas for the first time.  We then went back to the hotel and crashed around 2 or 3 I think.

What really sucked was waking up at 9 from my mother calling to tell me that I had to tell Kory, my brother, he needed to pick up a few books for Cameron, his son, for easter.  I mean, honestly, who's mother calls them in the morning, while their in Vegas, and tells them to go shopping.  Ugh...So, instead, we went to have breakfast and then walked half the strip until about 2.  We then went home and crashed for four hours.  It was much needed rest.

Randy and I then got ready and went down to the casino, where I lost $54 playing roulette and blackjack.  I have to say, I think I do a better job gambling when I'm tipsy than when I'm sober.  I couldn't add up the cards for whatever reason.  After losing that much money, Randy and I got Kory and we walked to the Monte Carlo, where we had an awesome buffet.  I tried oysters for the first time, and they didn't make me sick or horny.  Well, not anymore than I already am.

I had been talking to Sara most of the night on the phone because, coincidentally, her and her boyfriend were in Vegas this weekend as well, and they wanted to meet up.  So, we walked over to the Paris, and after about 5 days...a little exaggerated, more like 20 minutes, we actually met up and talked for a bit.  It was nice to see her there, but I felt bad because I forgot to call Natalie the day before to meet up with her.  It was like Vegas was the place to be this weekend.

So, after meeting up with Sara, we went to The Beach, and watched a bunch of people dance.  We were all pretty drained from the night before, so we went back to the hotel, gambled a bit, I won $135 at roulette, and then went to bed around 4.  Got up at 7 and came home to shower and get ready for work...which is where I am now.  All in all, not a bad weekend.  


To everyone who called and I didn't answer, I'm sorry, I was either drunk, gambling, or sleeping.  

Take care and...

Lately I've felt like a big kid.  I don't know why.  Usually I'm considered more mature than what people my age normally are, but recently, I just haven't cared.  I think I have good reason for it.

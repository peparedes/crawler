He's a fat jerk anyway.  lol...Daniel got fat too...she gets my old stuff when it gets fat and gross...lol...In geography cause yeah I'm bored.

I just read Ashley's LJ and yeah she's all talking about how she can't believe daniel did that to her or whatever, but who warned her?  Well Jessi finally made me realize that it's pointless even worrying about it because our relationship is over.  Me and Brian are on a break because i'm crazy in my head and i need time to think.  I guess that's all for now!

On the way home from Weight Watchers I told her that Ashley had gotten a truck for her b-day and then my mom was like ""This is the first time in the past 10 years that you wont be going to her b-day party"" and ""Remember when yall used to go on vacations with eachother?"" and ""Remember your first horse show together?""  and stuff like that and I started crying.  WHY CAN'T I GET OVER THE FACT THAT OUR 10 YEAR FRIENDSHIP MEANT NOTHING TO HER?  It just hurts me so much...I don't fucking care about Daniel, but Ashley was one of my VERY VERY VERY best friends.  Last year she is the only person that I told everything to.  I kinda wish that she would read this, but kinda not.  I  just want her back, I think...I don't know.

Ben asked me if I'd ever go on a date with him and I said that I didn't know...I mean I like Brian lots, but I just wanna be single for awhile, and I know that makes me a total bitch for I guess ""leading him on"", but it isn't like I don't have feelings for him.  Brian if you read this I love you to death and I DO like you LOTS and LOTS and LOTS, but it has been SOOOOOO long since I've been single and I just want to take advantage of it.  And me saying that I didn't want a boyfriend until school started wasn't just because of my paranoia about summer relationships, but also because I want to be single.  I hope you understand what I'm trying to say...and call me when you read this, I LOVE YOU MR. BRIAN!  Gosh I feel so bad for writing that...why am I such a bitch, seriously, I mean I hate everyone and when people like me I do bad things to them *EX: Aaron, Daniel, Brian* and I guess that's all, but still...BAND SUCKS!

"event","Ah!  I totally forgot to write!  Well I watched fireworks with Aaron and he told me that he loved me and it was great.  I told him that I love him too  and yeah.  Then on like Sunday? or something I went to eat pie with him and his family cause I was leaving the next day for Canada.  Canada was pretty.  We saw Niagra Falls and I got clothes, so that was fun!  I saw a lot of homeless people and I gave them all money, except for this one guy that was wearing Polo stuff. So I came home on Saturday after be gone for 5 days.  So I call Aaron and we talk and stuff and then I talked to Daniel...he told me that him and Ash were going out, and I didn't believe it, so  I called Jord and asked her if that was true and she said ""No, Ash would never do that to you"", so I just forgot about it cause I thought Daniel was lying.  So the next morning I woke up around 1 and saw that Jessi had called, so I called her back.  She said ""I can't believe Daniel and Ashley are going out."", and I just started crying.  I know that I'm over Daniel but I mean I will always love him just because he is my first love and I dunno...So yeah then I called Ash, and she couldn't understand what I was saying cause I was crying and stuff, so Jessi had to translate it for me.  I pretty much said that she should've talked to me about it first, and she knows how he treats girls, and he totally broke my heart and yeah.  They had been ""talking"" for 2 weeks before they went on a date the night before and started going out, and she didn't even think to talk to me about it first.  I mean, wouldn't you think to at least talk to your friend about it first?  Me and Ashley had been friends since we were 6 years old!  And she threw it all away for Daniel...DANIEL OF ALL PEOPLE!  I know this is mean but I hope he hurts her, I hope she feels maybe just 1% of the pain that he made me feel. So yeah when I called her the last thing that I said was ""I can't talk to you anymore"" and I hung up.   So then she wouldn't answer the phone when I called after that.  So I went to Jords house and had an ""Ashley is a backstabbing bitch"" party with Jord and Jessi.  So later that night I was online and asked her why she wouldn't answer my calls, cause I had called about 100000 times, and she said that she was mad at me ""because she didn't like my views"".  What the hell is that shit!?!?!?  What did I do wrong?  So we fought some and then I told her that she chose Daniel over me, and she said that she didn't choose anyone and then I told her that she could talk to me whenever she changed her mind about who she was choosing and that was the last thing that we said.  It hurt me sooooooo much, and I thought she was one of my best friends.  The number one rule of girl friendship is to NEVER DATE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS CURRENT OR EXBOYFRIENDS, ESPICALLY WITHOUT CONSULTING HER FIRST!!!!!  Well yeah so enough about that cause I don't wanna start crying...Well today me, Jord, and Jessi went to Six Flags and we bought Relient K tickets for Friday.  Aaron is coming over tomorrow and I guess that's all...I would like comments about the Ashley situation...

It was a lot better than last year cause it wasn't as long and it wasn't as hot and I got to talk to Ben, which made it funner.  It's weird, like the upperclassmen are being really nice to me this year, when last year on Chris Q. was.  And I found out that a senior likes me, but I just want to be friends cause I have my Aaron.  What else happened today....Ben asked me to go to eat after the parade with him and a lot of other people but I went home instead.  And he asked me if I wanted to go with him and some other people to blow up ""a little piece of America"".  He has $300 worth of fireworks in his trunk.  But I am planning on going to watch fireworks with Aaron...AWWW!  So cute.  Well Kevin and Daniel if you read this...FUCK BOTH OF YOU!  YOU CAN'T CONTROL MY LIFE!

Well I can die happy now because my life is complete!  Warped Tour is the equivalent to heaven!  Let me give you the highlights!  Ok, so we get there at like 10:45ish?  And so we walk around because the gates aren't open yet, so we find Daniel, Jaime, PJ, Kevin, and Willz.  At 11:30 they open the gates and we leave the boys.  So we're walking and there guys at this booth and they squirted water on me and told me to go over there and they asked me if I wanted to listen to their bands CD and I did and they asked me to come see them play, then we left.  So yeah walking around.  Saw Anti-Flag and they were freakin AWESOME!!!!!  They were sooooo good!  Then I saw the Eyeliners and they were freakin great, but not as good as Anti-Flag.  So me and Jessi are all walkin around and such and then we do stuff...I don't really remember every detail cause I'm not ""smart"".  Well we saw the boys and they were gonna get stuff signed my MxPx and so I gave Kevin my shirt for them to sign and then me and Jessi went to go wait in a giant mass of poser girls for 2 hours to meet Good Charlotte.  I honestly don't like their music so much, but my God can we say beautiful?  When me and Jessi finally got into the tent I took off my right Chuck and gave it to the first guy, I don't know his name, and he signed it.  Then Benji got it and I said ""I love all things rock!"" and he said ""Right on!"" and he put up his hand to give me a high five...HE gave ME a high five! AHHHH!  Then Benji said to me and Jessi ""You guys have good taste in music"", cause I was wearing a Ramones tank top and Jessii was wearing a Dropkick Murphys shirt.  Then I came to Joel, the man I am going to marry, and this is what happened...as he was signing my shoe I said ""Joel, I love you"" and he then stuck out his hand, to shake mine, and said ""Hi, what's your name?""  Then the last guy signed my shoe.  I TOUCHED BENJI AND JOEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So then me and Jessi were walking around and such and we saw the Eyeliners, so we went up to them and they signed my backpack!  Umm..then we saw NoFX, and I was totally expecting a better performance, and they didn't deliver what I wanted.  Then we saw Good Charlotte.  That's all I wanna say about Warped Tour, cause I don't wanna type a lot about it cause it's my secrect!

Ok, then Saturday I went to Jords par-tay!  It was me, Kevin, Jessi, Ash, Curtis, and <3Aaron<3  lol I'm a nerd!  Ok, so we were all hanging out in the living room and then we decided to watch some of  our old movies that me and Jord made during the summer when we were in like 3rd grade and then 1 that the Westians made.  They were soooo funny!  Why the hell were me and Jord so ugly?  I mean...God!  What was wrong with us?  Well then we started playing truth or dare, and I had to lick Curtis's foot! EWWW!  Then Jord and Curtis had to kiss.  Then they dared me and Ash to kiss...like tounge and stuff...NASTY like a mother, and yes we did do it.  And before we did Ash wispered in my ear ""after we're done look at the guys pants"".  So we looked and Curtis and Kevin were a little  umm...excited...lol!  Then we went swimming.  I would like to say that Aaron is one of the best boyfriends I have ever had...he is so sweet and I dunno, it's great.  Well yeah and we had fun at Jords house.  Well I guess that's all!

I swear, I was about to kill someone if I had to see any of those people ever again!  Yesterday Jorda, Ashley, and Jessi all spent the night.  We watched Orange County, then we went and burned a pic of me and Danny.  OHHHH!  And we made Kool-Aid with rum, but shhhhhhhhhh that's a secrect!  Then we played with some cards, not quite sure why.  And then we got the brillant idea to dye me and Ash's hair with Kool-Aid.  So now me and Ash have redish bangs...they kick much ass.  After that we watched the Mothman Prothesis!  SOOOOOOOO scary!  So yeah and we were up til 5:30 being losers.  I forgot to say that Aaron called me on Tuesday and yesterday!  It was kinda weird talking to him when he called the first time, I'm not sure why.  It's probably just because I'm a freak, but that's ok.

Hey, what are you up to?  It sucks that I have to go to Washington D.C. I would rather stay here and talk to you everyday like normal.  I'll try to get something for you in Washington, but I dunno considering the fact that I have no money.  Maybe we can hook up when I get back and suck face.  j/k (unless you want me to be not kidding), but I bet I would catch on fast, I'm a quick learner.  I just hope that I'm not grounded forever after my parents get my report card, maybe if I'm lucky my dad will be so mad he just wont talk to me for about a week, then we can still hook up.  I'm really gonna miss you while I'm gone, I'm gonna miss you A LOT!  Well I guess I better go, write me back, even thought I wont get it until next Sunday.

Well me and Jord went to the mall, we were supposed to meet Brooke and a lot of other people up there, but they were late, so we hung out with Doug and Anthony.  So we were walking around and such and then we found some of the other people, and we hung out with them for like 5 min, and then we left.  Ummm...I bought a shirt, a window decal for my car, and that's all...OH!  And a piece of pizza.  And we made Doug try on dresses at JCPennys.  Yeah!  On Thursday Aaron and Curtis went camping and me and Jord wrote Aaron 5 e-mails each...we're kidna losers.  And today we were supposed to go to the movies, but Aaron is a FAG and can't go.  And Jord tried to call Curtis, but he is working.  Aaron leaves tomorrow at 5am to go to Washington DC, and he's not coming back until next Sunday, so tonight we're gonna talk on the phone all night because we're losers.  I really like him, he's different.  I mean he's not like Danny, Danny was...I dunno...for lack of a better word  different.

I had to ask him about it and stuff, but oh well...Later me, Jord, and Jessi went to go see Aaron and Curtis's play.  It was really good and Curtis had to try not to laugh the entire time, and Aaron was all smiling and rolling his eyes at me because he had to do a funny dance.  And on Sunday we were supposed to take family pictures, but thank God we didn't have too.  I hate it sooooooooo much!  My mom all told me that she was ""gonna let me be my own person"" and not dress exactly like her and my dad, but then whenever we thought that we were gonna take them I tried to ""punk it up""and she all told me to take the safety pins and all my jewerly off.  Then on Sunday I was all on the phone with Aaron, and he, and we were talking and we decided that Jord and Curtis needed to go out, and so that became our mission.  Aaron had told his mom about me and him liking eachother, and how he ""stole"" me from Curtis.  THEN Aarons mom told Curtis's mom, and now Curtis's mom is all not liking Aaron.  Ok, so me and Jord spent the night at Jessi's house and stuff.  And the boys decided that they were gonna ask us out.  So we were all outside burying Danny's things, and Jord was inside on the phone with Curtis and he asked her out and she said yes.  Then me and Aaron were on the phone and we were talking about something and then he was like ""Will you go out with me?"" and I said ""Yes"".  Ok, then later Serg came over and I was outside talking to him, and Jord and Jessi came out and said ""Yeah Aaron said that it's over because you were making out with Serg"".  So I was like FINE!  If he's gonna be like that then I don't care, but then Jessi told me that it wasn't true. So yeah...then I was all outside talking to Serg, and stuff and then he left and I wenr inside.  So later I got a page...it was Danny and he was like all i'm sorry and i wouldn't except his appology and he said that me kissing Curtis on the cheek was equalivent to what he did...NOT REALLY!  Then I told him how i buried his stuff and that I was going out with Aaron and then he hung up.  Then we were on-line and Kevin was all calling us bitches and saying that he was gonna egg the house and that we sucked and stuff.  So we were upstairs watching TV and they called and asked if we heard that noise outside they window and we said no, so I told them to go to the front.  I went out there and i was all yelling at them and stuff, and then Jessi's mom yelled ""JESSIII!"" from upstairs.  So the boys ran like hell and were all scared and such.  So we kinda got in trouble, but not really since we were telling them to go away.  And yeah I guess that's all.  Me, Jord, Aaron, and Curtis might do something today.

In 2 days I get to go see Aaron and Curtis's play!  Yay!  Aaron is gonna kinda buy my ticket LoL...And it's like a blind date.  I watched Cruel Intentions last night and it was wonderful.  Then I watched some movie about a lesbian cheerleader on HBO, it really sucked.  Well yeah.  I'm bored out of my mind and no one worth talking to has called me today.  Well I guess I'm stop writing.  Passions is one in 1 hour and 25 min!!!  WAIT!  OMG!  I was talking to Ash and she was copied something into my IM and it said   "": Saggybitch: 209.245.234.132hey fatass  how many guys have you blown lately. stupid ho
Fatbitch: 64.12.106.52ur a skanky ass fat bitch yah whore!!!
Youraho: 209.245.234.132i dont know why im writing in here so bye fat ho"".  I thought someone wrote that in her Guestbook, but then she told me that it was in mine.  And Jaime and Jeff you are such fucking assholes.  You're just jealous because I wouldn't let Jaime do anything on the trip and because neither of you will ever get any!  Look at the fucking prude preps you hang out with.  And Jeff I have no idea why the hell they call you a ""prep punk"" or whatever the fuck...BLINK 182 AND NFG AND NOT PUNK!!!!!  And NFG stole the Deftones star and is saying that it's theirs...FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!"

"event","So last night I went to see The New Guy with Jessi and it was a GAY movie.  Then we went to Jamie's house and spent the night.  We were up until 5:30 because i dunno why.  And yeah.  Today I mowed the lawn and washed my car.  Then I got on-line casue I'm a loser.  And Tyler got on and told me some things that Danny told him.  ""McGee said that you're the best pussy he's had a probably will ever had"", and ""he said that Erin doesn't like him"", and ""he said that he THOUGHT he loved you"". So I'm freaking out and I call Danny and he told me that he likes Erin, ""but not as much as he used to"", and the worst thing that he said is that he ""still kinda loves me"".  Fuck I don't need this shit!  He TOLD me that he didn't like her every single time that I asked him if he did.  He TOLD me that he wasn't gonna talk to her anymore.  He TOLD me that he loved me.  I feel like such an idoit, I've been turning all these great guys down just because I've been waiting for him, when he's been liking her and lying to me the entire time!  I love him so much, but I don't know if i want to be with him if he's gonna treat me like this.  Actually if he does continue to treat me like this then I wont be with him again.  That is the hardest thing for me to say, and no one understands what I'm going though.  All my friends just tell me that I need to get over him, but I can't just get over him.  It's not the same with his as it was with other guys.  I love him, and I don't wanna be without him, but I think that i'm going to have to give  him up.  Danny if you read this, Why, just tell me why you did this to me?  You told me that you needed this month so that you could improve yourself, but what you really wanted was to not be with me anymore.  If that's what you wanted you could've just told me instead of lying to me and leading me on.  

People please comment on what I should do

"event","Hi!  My dad bought me Harry Potter yesterday, and it is a wonderful wonderful thing.  Danny isn't talking to Erin anymore.  Now he's talking to Alexis, who is the biggest fucking slut EVER!  Anyone that went to the band banquet would understand...I mean if you ever touch Ben Smithy then you're nasty but she was like all over his balls!  And me and Brooke would ALWAYS make fun of her because she is all preppy and such, but she had a patch on her backpack that said ""Support your local punk band"" and it has and Anarchy symbol on it.  HER LOCAL PUNK BAND IS BLINK 182!!!  Oh well...his life, and I can't control him and if he wants THAT i mean, what can i do?  First he has a prude prep, then he was a preppy poser, what's gonna come next?  A chick with ballls?  My car shall be arriving shortly, and I can't wait!  I am going to punk it up lol...I'm gonna put a Rancid and a NoFX sticker on it, and if i'm lucky enough to find a Gary sticker, then i'll put that on it too.  I guess that's all for now.

I hate my drivers ed class, it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring!  All the guy does is read out of the driving book for 2 hours.  Tomorrow we have a pretest thingy and then Monday I take the test to get my permit.  If Danny and Serg passed it, then I KNOW that I can!  Well, someone told Danny who Oscar and Charles were, so he got all mad at me but not at them.  Does that make sense?  Well I'm going to take Jessi's advice and write about stuff that does not revolve around Danny...today my dad bought Harry Potter, we watched it.  Before that I watched TLC all day and totally forgot about Passions!  In case you couldn't tell today was BORING!  I'll write later if for some odd reason something exciting happens."

"event","Ok, well *Oscar* has given me more info, and I am complete and utterly confused.  Well Oscar called me and told me that he talked to someone very close to Danny, we will call this person *Charles*. Well Oscar asked Charles what was happening with Danny and Erin, and Charles said that nothing was happening because she is so prude.  Then Oscar asked what was happening with me and Danny, and Charles said that Daniel said that he didn't even like me anymore and he was just using me for play.  Even though last night he told me that he loves me...I have no idea what to do.  Me and Jessi are believing Oscar, I really don't want to believe him, but I mean this is the same exact thing that he did to his ex Mariah (I think that's how you spell it).  I just don't know what to do or think, this whole thing is just stressing me out sooo bad and I have no idea what to do.  If anyone would like to, please leave a comment on what you think I should do, it would be very helpful...

"event","I SWEAR TO GOD I HATE HIM SOOOOOO MUCH SOMETIMES!  OK LET ME SHARE WHAT INFORMATION I NOW HAVE:
Ok, so someone who we will call *Oscar* called me and we were all talking and stuff, then the topic of Daniel came up.  Oscar then told me about how Danny told him that he really likes Erin and that he talks to her all the time and that he's just using me for ""play"".  And Danny's all denying it, and I wanna believe him sooo badly, but I dunno.  Well i just got off the phone with him and he told me that he was ""gonna do something worse"" because he was telling me that he was gonna get a beer, and then he said ""ya know what I don't give a fuck anymore"" and hung up.  I am really scared...Danny if you read this I love you and please don't do anything, I need you and I don't know what I'd do without you.  You know that I have other guys that want me, but I am turning them down for you, because I LOVE YOU!  And if you don't want me anymore then just tell me, because I don't believe that crap about you not knowing if you wanna be with me, you know if you want to or not.  I think that Danny just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings, or it's true that he's just using me for ""play"".  Well I'm pissed

"event","Wow, this is gonna be kinda weird the first couple of time I write in here.  Well if you're one of the few people that I'm actually telling about this then I'm trusting you not to judge me or anything.  Well I guess I should talk about what's happening in my life right now.  

I'm pretty sure that everyone is aware of the craziness of the Danny situation, and in case you don't, then I'll recap:
Well on May 22 my mom made me break up with him because she found out about me giving him oral stimulation.  So I broke up with him totally against my will.  The next day he started ""talking"" to Erin that stupid little bitch that is stealing my Danny away from me.  Ok well he started talking to her, I guess she's kinda his rebound.  He called me on Saturday night and told me that he needed a month and that he still wanted us to talk and stuff, but not ""be together"".  I told him that I would call him when I was ready to talk again.  Well Monday night HE called ME to ask me to go to Six Flags, even though he knew that I wasn't ready to talk to him yet, and when I told him that he was like ""Well I am ready to talk""  FUCK YOU DANNY YOU DON'T FUCKING CONTROL ME!!!!!  Ok,  and then we were all talking and I was of course crying.  Danny is the first guy that I have actually cared about and I love him with all my heart, and I have no idea what I'm gonna do if I loose him.  Then he told me that we wants us to ""act like we're going out only we're 'just friends'"".  So pretty much, we do things together, we hang out, and I can't talk to other boys, but we're just friends.  Does that make ANY SENSE????  No it doesn't!  And then I asked him why we weren't together and he said that he needed a month, and then I asked him why I couldn't talk and hangout with other guys and crap and he said that he was afraid that they were gonna take me away or something.  OH!!!  And Erin has never had a boyfriend and she's never kissed a boy, and he fave bands are GreenDay and NEW Blink 182, oh and she's a prep, now please explain to me why the hell Danny would want that!?!?!?!? AGAIN FUCK YOU DANNY!  And it is sooooooo pissing me off how he is still acting like the only one who is hurting and that I'm the one that caused all of his pain, even though I'm the one that wants to get back together and he doesn't, he needs 29 more days (Yes I am counting).  Well no more Danny talk.  Monday I went to Kevins house with Krebs, Willz, and Tyler.  We were all hanging out and such.  Then I got raped by a 6 year old girl.  Then when I got home Kevin and Willz called me.  And I was all talking to Willz and he asked me out for Kevin...how gay is taht?  He couldn't even do it himself...and before I told him that I wouldn't go out with him because he is one of my best guy friends, and I wouldn't wanna screw that up.  And now Krebs is liking me too, and no one seems to understand that I need some time!  JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!  ALL I WANT IS SOME ASS NOT A RELATIONSHIP! AND Krebs has a freakin girlfriend anyway!  UGH!  I am too frustuurated to write anymore....

Sad though...i've never met anyone so freaking perfect for me...i hope there's more like her out there...ehehe 

Sidethought....this is a lame post...but who the heck cares!! :))"

"event","Last night was one of the MOST MIRACULOUS nights of my life. I felt like I was in highschool again. Remember how it felt when you first met this girl that you'd never thought you'd get to know then go on to have the most AMAZING conversation of your life. I mean, the works. Its so ""story book""! Like finding out that you share the same interests and think the same about some things, heck, even be allergic to the same food...hahaha!! I know i'm rambling but I DONT CARE!!! BWAHAHAHA!!!. It also helps that this woman had the most OVERWHELMINGLY BREATHTAKING smile i have EVER, in my 25 years, seen with my 2 eyes! Geez...i could go on and on about her and all i'd be thinking is just how gorgeous her smile was. Ok...i'm starting to sound pathetic now...but it feels so good! I've missed out on feeling like this for WAY too long. Anyways...just wanted to vent some o the happiness i guess. :)"

"event","Its 3 in the freakin morning and i cant sleep. Nothing new to me but i hate tonights reason for insomnia. The love of my life left for New York yesterday so here i was all excited for her and happy that she finally got the vacation she deserves, then she up and tells me that she's staying with her ex! Oh freakin joy!! I know i'm usually not the jealous type but this time, its just driving me up the proverbial wall! I hate it...punyeta do i HATE IT!! CRAAAAPPP!!! ok...i know this is a senseless entry but i just had to vent. I dont really know why i'm so ticked off, i mean in my head i trust her with what she says and all and i know she's a big girl and she can handle herself...i guess i just hate being so helpless, coz God knows how much i worry about her. Oh well...guess i'll just have to wait...crap!!"

"event","To quote a good friend of mine on the topic, he boldly states ""Women! Cant live without them, cant shoot them either!"" What a conundrum! hahaha. Dont you just hate in when you've tried SO hard to set your mind to getting over someone coz SHE said that things wont work out, then all of a sudden, she acts like nothing happened and you end up being just as sweet to each other as when you started? Talk about conflict of interest. Oh well...at least that took the boredom right out of my otherwise drab day. I just wonder if all this emotional excitement is worth the trouble I KNOW its gonna cause me in the long run. I hope i'm wrong though...hehehe."

"event","Its almost seven in the evening and i've been trying to get some work done all day...and to no avail. All i have to show for is around 3 unfinished songs...crap!! hehe. I kinda thought that being in a state of emotional instability would help the song writting process...i guess not. Ok, so maybe it does, but it sure as hell wont put words in your head that arent there to begin with. And sometimes words just dont cut it altogether...again, crap! heheh. Oh well... i wonder if any of this makes any sense. Maybe in a couple o weeks, i'll look back at this and figure that i should'nt have started this at all...we'll all see...hehehe."

"event","OK, a friend o mine told me that maybe i should start by posting some stuff i wrote and maybe people would notice them and make comments on them...(i write songs every now and then so these might look like weird poems, some might look like plain old poems...hehehe) To my friends from foreign countries, i appologize coz this one's in my native tongue...hehehe. Here goes...



Maari kayang makausap kita
Kahit sandali lang
Wag sanang matakot
at 'wag ma ilang

Nais ko lang na mailabas
at mapahiwatig
Ang kay tagal nang nilalaman
ng aking dibdib

'Wag ka sanang matakot sa'kin
Sana ay pakinggan ang aking sasabihin

Kay tagal na kitang pinagmamasdan
At matagal nang nabighani sa 'yong kagandahan
Lahat ng bagay ay aking gagawin
Para lang ikaw ay makapiling
Para lang ikaw ay makapiling

Pasensya ka na kung ika'y naabala
dahil sakin
Di ko naman
sinasadya
Maari kayang 
mahingi ang 'yong pangalan
kung ayaw naman ay ok lang
ika'y na iintidihan

Medyo di pangkaraniwan ang aking hiling
Pero sana'y pakinggan ang aking sasabihin....

I know its ""baduy"" but hey, if you hear it with the music...its kinda catchy...hahah!!
And yeah, it DOES look like its a stalker writing the damn thing."

"event","Alrighty then, after much cajoling from various friends, i finally made it into to livejournal community. I figure i'd take some advice from someone saying that if i keep everything inside my head INSIDE MY HEAD, it'll explode sooner or later...so what the heck. I dont really know where to start or what to say at the moment so i suppose this will me a lame ass intro. If anyone's got any inspired ideas as to how to start this thing...i'd greatly appreciate them. In any case...i've got a sinking feeling this post is gonna have a follow up real soon. Godbless y'all!"

 It's such a formal yet casual sort of a day....  A day for sport and a day for fun...
Mr. Howell agrees with me and says I look good in anything..... But no matter. ( He's so cute!)
It always calls for pearls with a touch of casual cotton. Opera gloves are optional girls... As long as you have an escort for dinner you will do nicely. 

Mr. Howell and the Skipper went for a walk to the other side of the island to check up on the Professor and Gilligan.(Which gives me time ot flatten out his Wallstreet Journal.) The Professor is looking for some sort of a sea shell or something to use for recharging batteries or someting like that. And Gilligan was helping him. Poor professor....he tries so hard.

The Girls and I are working on a new weaving sort of thing for some new clothes.  The Professor is such a genius and has found that the leaves from some sort of tree here can be dried and made into a silky cotton sort of material. We're not that sure but were going to give it a try anyhow... Ginger says it will be great for making me a new hat. But Im not all that sure about clothes from it.  seems a little rough to me. We'll see...

Well, that's all for Wednesday.... We're getting ready for the our Fourth of July celebration.... That should be great fun!
 
Oh one last thing.... Please check out this fabulous place I have just discovered

<lj-cut text=""Gilligans Island The Musical"">

In 1980 Sherwood Schwartz had seen Annie in New York.  It was then in the third year of it's run on the Broadway stage.  Annie had just become the eighth longest-running musical in Broadway history.  He was inspired by this as he felt that Gilligan like Annie had become a part of American Pop Culture and would be a perfect vehicle to become a Broadway Musical.  Some time passed, then.  Sherwood asked  United Artist, the studio that had originally bankrolled the series, if they were interested in a musical version of Gilligan's Island for Broadway. Unfortunately, United Artist had bankrolled two Broadway plays the previous season, and both investments had proven disastrous.  So the Musical waited.  After some time past a few years.  Then  Sherwood started up again on the project. at some point Sherwoods  son in law, <a href=""http://www.laurencejuber.com/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Laurence Juber (Lead Guitarist for Paul McCartney's group Wings</a>. was brought in and the project began to gain speed. It  became a  family affair for Lloyd and Sherwood Schwartz, his daughter Hope and her husband Laurence.  Lloyd and Sherwood worked on the book, Laurence and Hope worked on the score.  It was a very close collaboration. After about a year it was ready for some workshop performances.  Then around 1988  More work..and more  workshop performances came and went....and right on thru 1992. It's world premiere was in June 1992 (eleven years ago) at the Flat Rock Playhouse in North Carolina.  The Audience loved it and so did the critics. Then the Musical went on to open in Chicago that November. Since that time it's popped up all over....in California and in Hawaii....

Well....

That's all for today,
LOVEY

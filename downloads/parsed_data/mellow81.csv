"event","My job is seriously getting me down...Everyday, there is something happening, that requires my complete and devoted attention.  This is not a problem for me.  But, when there are several things happening, that go beyond normal multitasking capabilities, I start to stress-out.  I'm tired of being nice to customers.  I'm tired of checking in dirty rooms, I'm tired of having to call and make appointments with vendors, I'm tired of having to make reservations, I'm tired of making sure everything is balanced, I'm tired of answering questions, and being asked questions that I don't have answers to, I'm tired of certain aspects of the staff, I'm tired of doing homework, I'm tired of this shift, I'm tired tired tired...I would like to come into work, and just do what I'm there for...check people in and do well-with a good attitude.  It's hard to do a lot of what is asked of me and still want to be nice to people while I'm doing it.  I can only be pulled in so many directions at once, and I feel like taffy now.  All stretched out!!!"

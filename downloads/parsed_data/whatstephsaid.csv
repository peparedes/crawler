It's the very thing I savour

You would be my favourite one 

My imagination sees you
Like a painting by Van Gogh
Starry nights and bright sunflowers
Follow you where you may go 

Oh, I've loved you from the start
In every single way
And more each passing day
You are brighter than the stars
Believe me when I say
It's not about your scars
It's all about your heart 

You're a butterfly held captive
Small and safe in your cocoon
Go on you can take your time
Time is said to heal all wounds

Like a mystery without a clue
There is no me if I cannot have you

"event","<br />Our GP teacher wants us to start blogging and live successfully happily ever after or fail and go to jail so here is my first post in my attempt to live succesfully ever after. Here goes:<br /><br />Sometimes I think too much and all of&nbsp; my thoughts are really different from each one, they're all jumbled up ready to be rounded and lost as marbles. Then again, ain't it normal to think you're going crazy sometimes.<br /><br />What causes <em>madness</em>?<br /><br /><strong>Environment + Genes <br /></strong>Mental disorders can arise from a combination of sources. In many cases there is no single accepted or consistent cause currently established. A common belief even to this day is that disorders result from genetic vulnerabilities exposed by environmental stressors. (see Diathesis-stress model). However, it is clear enough from a simple statistical analysis across the whole spectrum of mental health disorders at least in western cultures that there is a strong relationship between the various forms of severe and complex mental disorder in adulthood and the abuse (physical, sexual or emotional) or neglect of children during the developmental years. Child sexual abuse alone plays a significant role in the causation of a significant percentage of all mental disorders in adult females, most notable examples being eating disorders and borderline personality disorder.<br />Studies have indicated that&nbsp;genes often play an important role in the development of mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific categories of disorder has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding pregnancy and birth have also been implicated. Traumatic brain injury may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. There have been some tentative inconsistent links found to certain viral infections, to substance misuse, and to general physical health.<br /><br /><strong>Social influences</strong><br />Social influences have been found to be important, including abuse, bullying and other negative or stressful life experiences. The specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear, however. Aspects of the wider community have also been implicated, including employment problems, socioeconomic inequality, lack of social cohesion, problems linked to migration, and features of particular societies and cultures.<br /><em><font color=""#c0c0c0"" size=""5"">The mind is deceit and treachery contained within its own delusions and illusions.

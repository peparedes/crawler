In other news, I'm a loser, I'll never get a job, I'm just going to stay home, watch tv, surf the internet and blow off my career."

"event","Ok, so I leave for Seattle tomorow. I'm not savvy enough to post while I'm gone. If I'm really good and organized I'll post my outfit b4 I leave for those who were interested (but don't count on it). Maybe I'll get Jimi's too. Or maybe I'll just do a blitz when I get back.

So, I'm tired. Everyone asleep. I need to wait another half an hour b4 my sleep meds and pain meds kick in so that I can do my interfron and then quietly go unconscious.

I decided to handle Randy and his wife by making myself invisible. My energy will be a still pond. I'll be blank."

"event","So today (Oh ok, yesterday, I'm up in the middle of the night again typing--it's the only time I can think in peace lately) was a good day. 

I went to coparenting with Randy. He TOTALLY lost it. He was yelling at me, calling me names, threatening me, insulting my father... his face was so red and twitchy I thought he was going to blow a vein right there in the room! It was good because the coparenter got to see what he's really like. And also because I handled it all pretty good. It drives me crazy when people fall for his con, but when all that's stripped back and people can see what I've been dealing with, I settle right down. I think it's because deep down I just want some help. And no one can help me if they can't see what's going on. So the coparenter made him promise not to call me names and yell at me. Not that I believe he's capable of that, but at least it's being addressed. Oh and he had to promise the same for his wife.

Then I went jogging. I did the best I've done yet. Not because I've been working at it, but I think it's because the meds are working.

Yeah, it was a good day."

"event","I think I'm sick. I slept like a motherfucker yesterday. The phone rang 5 x's between 8:30 and 10 am. I got up, talked t people, then fell right back into a deep sleep each time. Complete with dreams. Not to mention that I've felt crappy for about a week now. Today I'm better and Jimi's worse. That makes me think it's some kind of bug. With everything going on it's hard to tell what's stress, what's my meds, what's allergies and what's a cold. When in doubt I  choose option D) all of the above.

Speaking of my meds, my 3 month marker labs came back and my Hep C is at an undetectable level. Yay for me! Because of my next to no side effects I was paranoid it wasn't working, or I was doing it wrong or something. But I guess it's just the opposite, the fewer side effects the better it's working. Oh I dunno. So the next marker is at 6 months past the end of treatment. If I still have no detectable signs then it's considered a cure. Keep your fingers crossed. The only problem I'm having from a lab point of view is that my white blood cell count is getting alarmingly low. This causes fatigue. Apparently if it gets lower they just give me a shot and it fixes me right up. Of course the junkie in me is all behind that!"

"event","OK, I succumbed to peer pressure and am giving this a try. I don't like being on the computer too long at any one time, I feel like I'm trapped here, can't move around, but we'll see how it goes. Since I'm off work I may actually do it. And, I realized if I'd done this while I was at work I might not have been so frustrated.

So speaking of work, unemplyment called me and my job is making fraudulent claims in an effort to deny me unemployment... And so it goes on.

After I found that out I found out my job still hasn't called my health insurance to let them know I COBRA'd, and my medications are almost out...

Then my mom called and my dad is in the hospital again...

Sigh, I don't want to go back to work."

"event","have you ever walked into the kitchen starving? what was your first reaction? to immediately raid the refrigerator, and pantry of anything that would fill up your hunger pains, i'm sure.

but, have you ever found yourself starving in a spiritual since? and what was your first reaction? did you seek to find an immediate aversion to God's call on your heart? did you find a movie, or book that was far more interesting than the Bible?

how many times i starve, and refuse to feed myself sound food. instead, i satisfy myself with junk food.

i have so much to learn. Father quench my desire with only You."

"event","have you ever been in a praise service, where you were sure it was just you and God? where you just streched your hands to the heavens, savoring every drop of grace from heaven? when your body felt as though you could fly into the heavens, straight into the arms of God? where your spiritual thirst was so great, you begged for more? beautiful times when God showed you the beauty when we choose to loose the ""boundaires"" that <i>man</i> puts up. beauty when you fall down in worship, knowing this is what you were created for. beauty when you seek His face with the earnestness of David, as He called on the name of God regardless of where he was, or whom he was with. there is nothing i want more than to live a life of total worship to my Savior.

o gracious God, would you pour your love down on them as never before?
will you fill their empty souls with a longing for you? 
will you touch their broken lives, and make them whole?
will you show them the way, the truth and the life?"

"event","why do Christian want to hurt one another?

why do 'Christians' snob each other? why are we stingy with frienships? why is the church so cold?

why do we enjoy hurting one another, and rolling in gossip?

why don't we act like Jesus? 

why?

it's so wrong. it's disgusting.

i hate to think how many times i've failed Ephesians 5:1...

Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for su as a fragrant offering and sacrifice of God.

do i imitate God?
do i live a life of love as Christ did?
do i give myself up to god as a frangrant offering?

<i>do i even try to imitate God?</i>

oh, God, help me. help me find you. help me to be more like you. that is what i want, more than anything. be my center, be my universe."

There's a Rose in Bethlehem 
With a beauty quite divine 
Perfect in this world of sin 
On this silent, holy night 

There's a frarance much like hope 
That it sends upon the wind 
Reaching out to every soul 
From a lowly manger's crib 

Oh, Rose of Bethlehem 
How lovely, pure and sweet 
Born to glorify the Father 
Born to wear the thorns for me 

There's a Rose in Bethlehem 
Colored red like mercy's blood 
Tis the flower of our faith 
Tis the blossom of God's love 

Though its bloom is fresh 
with youth 
Surely what will be He knows 
For a tear of morning dew 
Is rolling down the Rose 

There's a Rose in Bethlehem 
With a beauty quite divine 
Perfect in this world of sin 
On this silent, holy night"

Nothing particulary interesting happened today, except my car really broke down today and I left it at the garage and was supposed to pick it up at 5pm and I forgot and didn't get there til' 5:11pm and he was already gone. So...no car. And I gotta work tomorrow at 10am so...not sure how thats gonna happen since he doesn't usually open til 10 anyways. Oh well. If Alex had been here when he said he would...it would have been fine. I just wish he would get here...I'm hungry. LOL Last night weren't too good either. My womens studies class ran late and didn't get outta there til' almost 10pm at which point it was pouring rain and my car wasn't running right so I went home instead of going over to Crystals like I was supposed to. So Amie and Crystal are probably mad. Ehhh....oh well. Everyone eventually gets mad at me lol. Well, I'm gonna go even though I have no where to go TO, oh well. :)&nbsp; I love saying oh well.

"event","Some people just plain SUCK! These are, among others, people who are sneaky liars, who you can never trust. The particular jerk I am thinking of today, happens to be one whom I signed up for classes with because at the time he was a nice guy. Both of the classes he suggested. The first class was kayaking. I signed up for it thinking okay well it'll be cool I'll have someone I know with me..sure why not. Well I'll tell you why not. It started off we were late driving up there, so he drove 120 mph! I know a lot of people are like ""wow, thats cool!"" Well, I'm not, I happen to have known people who died in car accidents. And swerving around at 120 mph put my life, his life, and everyone on the roads life in danger. I let that go because we were, afterall, late for class. Then we got to this wonderful class and I had to put a wetsuit on that didn't fit by any stretch of the imagination...and I was extremely uncomfortable all day. Then I got seasick. Wow, that was fun. But neither the suit or the sickness was his fault. However, when lunch rolled around all I wanted to do was sit in the car (that makes me feel better usually) and eat my lunch. But this particular guy refused to let me sit in his car because ""I don't want saltwater on the seats"", this is strange when you consider that not even my feet had been in the water. I told him that I was completely dry with no saltwater anywheres and he said ""I don't care I don't want you in my car"" What an ASS! If I was in his postion, even if the person was soaking wet, I would let a sick person sit down in my car! It's funny how he has such a lack of empathy, when you consider his current profession! Anyways then we have to get back in the boats, and we're supposed to practice rescues. Since I was feeling really sick, I asked if he wanted to get in the water and I'd rescue him. He said No, which would have been fine. Except that after a while he decided he would go in, and he told me that. So I helped him while he took off his sneakers, which he put in my boat. Finally, when he was all ready (in front of a group of people) he was like ""Alright, now I gotta find someone to rescue me"" and I was like ""Gee, thanks ___"" Oh well, he only picked some skinny blond girl (who he ended up flipping over anyways) :) and who had already had a chance to rescue a bunch of people. but whatever, I wouldn't wanna rescue him anyways.  Finally the day was over, and we got in the car and headed for home. Well down the long winding, narrow road from the beach he averaged 70-80 mph. Very dangerous. Meanwhile I told him I had to go the bathroom and asked if I should wait til Brunswick, he said yeah wait. Well I didn't get to use the bathroom till Portland. But that wasn't that long of a drive since he went 110 mph the whole way back, through afternoon traffic. He swerved and dodged cars and braked at the last minute. I was desperate to get out of the car. It was awful. It was a terrible day. That'll def. teach me not to take classes with people I know. Because what could seem like a really nice guy at the beginning of the summer might turn out to be a prick to you in the fall. On top of all that I also got a very nice bladder infection from not being able to go to the bathroom, I wish I had peed on his precious seats!! :)
      I'm not writing this to be mean to any of his friends, or girlfriend. I'm writing this so that if they should happen to read this they can know what a jerk he was to me. And if he can be that rude and mean to me what makes you think he can't be to you?!  Oh yeah I also forgot to tell you that he secretly dropped the other class I had with him, psychology, w/o saying anything to me, the last day of the drop period. So that I would be stuck in it, alone. In a class he picked. Yeah Thanks a Lot! Really nice! If he had been at all decent he would have at least  told me so that I could have thought about whether or not to stay in the class. Too late now! Whatever, I'm def. better off without that in my class.
      What really pisses me off is that I was nice and courteous towards him. I should have told him what an arrogant prick he really is. Thinking hes all great. Not caring at all about others (except a select few) But again too late for that, cause I don't wanna talk to him again-ever. Oh and I pray that he gets pulled over and gets his license taken away, before someone gets killed. He must be pretty stupid to think that its safe for him to be driving that way. I hope I hope someone with a brain can tell him to drive better and not go 60mph over the speed limit. I worry about my friends who drive with him, and urge them not to. I don't wanna go to any funerals!
      Thanks for Reading,
           Sarah"

"event","Well today was a total blast. LOL Slept til' 2pm. Then waited around for Alex til' 6pm. Way cool. But we did have a pretty good time, ate Thai food and watched a movie (The Longest Yard) Abby chilled with us too. Very fun. We were gonna go to the Cumberland County Fair, but it was cold and rainy and I have a bad cold. Alex told me tonight that he wants to wait til' he's 35 to move out of his house. LOL OMG! I told him he'd better kiss me goodbye cause there was no way in Hell I'm waiting that long. He offered 25 instead. hahaha. 25 sounds a lot better to me, maybe a bit long but better than 35! Besides I know I can talk him into it sooner than that if I try. I have persuasive powers! :)
      Anyways, I'm doing my homework for my womens studies class and boy is that crazy! We're reading about Gender and Islamic Art and stuff and I was reading a poem. Its so scary I think you should hear some of it.  :
      ""...Feed her three square meals a day,
    give her saris, ornaments, and good soap
    to smooth on her body.
    She won't raise her eyes, she won't raise her voice
    she's a shy and modest woman,
    she can cook seven dishes for one midday meal.
       This female item can be used any way you like!
    If you wish, chain her feet, chain her hands,
    put her mind in chains
    if you wish divorce her, say divorce
    and you've divorced her.""   ~Taslima Nasrin (Female Goods)

     Needless to say this poem kinda pissed me off. I could deal with the whole, meals and good soaps but they lost me at the chains and cooking 7 dishes for lunch. I also really didn't like the whole meekness woman are supposed to posess, cause I sure as heck ain't got it! But what ever, tell me your opinions of the poems...it's not the whole poem only the second half. In the 1st half this is said: ""No hand has touched her virgin limbs, her liquids have not spilled, a woman not yet enjoyed.""  Ewww, now tell me that doesn't make women seem discusting creatures?! 
      Anyways I'm gonna go but any comments are well welcomed. Even ones that aren't what I wanna hear (Ray) lol Have a good night everybody! 
      Love,
      Sarah"

I just read the obituary about it on portland press herald (amie told me) and it is really, REALLY sad. I feel terrible about it. What a terrible way to die. What torture he must have been going through to be so selfish as to leave everyone who cared about him. He was a smart guy, he had to have realized he wouldn't come back. :(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel really bad for his girlfriend and his parents and brother, and everyone close to him actually. They must feel awful, they must feel guilty. Its NOT their fault, but I'm sure it must be in their minds....what if I had done this...what if I hadn't said that.... and they'll always wonder if they could have prevented it. He must have been in so much pain and anguish. I feel awful about the whole thing and I don't think I ever even met him...saw him around but never met him. Please, anyone I know ...don't kill yourself!!!! I would not be able to deal with anyone I knew commiting suicide. So if you feel like you wanna die...talk to someone! Talk to me! (and a therapist :)&nbsp; But just don't do it okay?!!?!? GOOD!&nbsp; But I feel awful so I'm gonna go to bed and say a prayer for this poor lost boy, lost to family and lost to friends, and definately lost to himself.

LOL It was on deaths door.I'm at USM. This semester I'm taking : English101, psychology101, 2nd year French, Intro to Sea Kayaking, and Gender Respresentation &something else can't remember (basically womens studies lol) So far classes have been good French2 is tres difficile! We have an online workbook for the class and we have to do every exercise and since its online if one space or accent is wrong in the sentence--its ALL wrong. CRAZY! My birthday is coming up Sept.20th and I will no longer be a teenager. I'll be freakin' 20 years old!!!! OMG thats crazy, just yesterday I was 9. Alex and I are still together, and everyday I like him a little more (its getting to be ridiculous) :) I'm just a tad obsessed...but not in a creepy way. I don't think...  He came over w/o me asking and helped me move a like 200 pound computer desk down 3 flights of stairs at 11:30pm, and then set my computer up for me! What a SWEETY! I'm gonna take him out to diner to thank him tomorrow! 
     Everyone in my little group of friends seem to be doing well. Not too sure about Crystal - haven't talked to her lately. Ever since she called me a trashy whore...well not exactly, but it was implied. I didn't particulary like that. but whatever. Can't do much about that now.
     Heard sad news today. A guy Abby went to school with at Deering, killed himself yesterday. Hung himself in his bathroom. He was in the top 10 students in his class and went to a really nice college, but he had problems with his parents, pushing him too hard. Don't know all the details, but it was very sad to hear, that someone so young and full of potential would take their own life. Tragedy.
     Well, sorry to leave on a glum note but I am very tired, and I have a bad cold so I'm gonna go! Good luck to all of my buddies in college (and the rest too)! Miss you Amie! Goodnight Peoples! :)                      Love Always,  Sarah"

For you, kissing is about all about following your urges
							  If someone's hot, you'll go in for the kiss - end of story
							  You can keep any relationship hot with your steamy kisses
							  A total spark plug - your kisses are bound to get you in trouble</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#FFA5B2""><h3 style=""margin: 0; border: 0;"">Part Expert Kisser</h3></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#FFDBE0""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.quizdiva.net/kindkisser/expert.jpg""></div>
You're a kissing pro, but it's all about quality and not quantity
							  You've perfected your kissing technique and can knock anyone's socks off
							  And you're adaptable, giving each partner what they crave
							  When it comes down to it, your kisses are truly unforgettable</td></tr></table>

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc0000>I am a changed woman! I will not drink again! For a loooooonnnnggggggg time! Alcohol is NOT my friend. Thank God I have such a wonderfully understanding boyfriend! Who cares so much about me that he would be willing to overlook my stupidity. Alex is a great guy! and he is too good to me and I think everybody should know that! Anybody who knows me would know that I am completely smitten with him and never ever want to hurt him! I care so much about him! OKAY you've all heard much to much mush for at least a year....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other news I was reading an old buddys livejournal tonight...and my oh my was it sad. I hope this person doesn't hurt themselves because I was truly worried. Well I dont know if I should be able to be worried since I never see this person anyways and they probably don't even remember me. But it was one of those things where the intensity of the sadness reaches out to me and makes me horribly upset. :(&nbsp;&nbsp; This person (okay shes a she), she talked about&nbsp;how sad she was and how&nbsp;nobody cared about her, and that she couldn't physically stop crying. Then she went on to describe her whole life, and all the bad parts with no good parts at all. She spoke of being used by several guys for sex, abortion, and an abusive family life. I felt really bad for her. She was the quiet girl in school, the one that too often went unnoticed. Little did I know that she was&nbsp;having such hard times! The entire time I was reading it I had mixed feelings. Firstly I felt terrible as I've said. Then I started to get mad at her for being so hopeless and weak...for letting herself fall down so low in her mind. And I began to see relations between my depression and hers.&nbsp;Then finally (and I hate to admit it) I&nbsp;got&nbsp;pretty annoyed by her. I mean this girl obviously has problems she should be talking to a therapist regularly but yet in her livejournal she said she didn't like therapists-didnt like talking to them. Also this girl in my humble opinion would be a prime candidate for anti-depressant medication. Actually the poster-child for it! I know I might sound mean&nbsp;and harsh, but come on girl! Get help! You really need it! She'll probably &nbsp;read this, and I hope she does. As long as I've known her (about 7 years) shes been sad. Like I've never seen her happy NEVER! I don't think I've ever really seen her smile or laugh. And it makes me feel so bad to see someone suffering in constant pain, because I do have an idea of what its like!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways I'm gonna go to beddy-by cause its getting really late! :( But tomorrow after work I get to probably spend the night at Alex's house while his parents are in New Jersey! I love N.J! hehehe&nbsp; That should be fun watching movies and what not!&nbsp; Well talk to ya'll later! Sleep well! </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Hey everybody (a.k.a the three people who may read this)&nbsp; hehe! Whats up?&nbsp; Well this weeks been pretty darn good! Work seems to be getting a bit better. YAY! This girl Becky's really nice and she keeps inviting me to parties, dancing and shiznit. I really should take her up on the offers! I've been spending some time with Alex and thats been really pretty great. He sooo sweet! Always hugging me and giving me little kisses on the cheek :)&nbsp; He makes me smile!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abbys been hanging out with this nice dude named Kirill, hes Russian and Jewish (SWEET!) lol&nbsp; He's so hot! Recently heard that Ray-Ray made some rather anti-semetic remarks. Something along the lines of all Jewish people being wimps. very very very not cool Ray! I don't know too many Jewish people , I'm only half Jewish,&nbsp; but I do know at least one who could and probably would kick your ass if he heard you say that. Lately certain people have been stereotyping&nbsp;others even more than usual and I'd really like it to stop... don't call until you can stop being dicks! If you're really ignorant enough to hold those opinions- fine- but I don't ever wanna hear them.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#000066>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on.....&nbsp;&nbsp; something semi funny happened this week Amie and I made up a ""fib"" about her being engaged to Dan in order to get Nathalie to be able to come up and visit! We even found a little gold engagement ring. LOL Then we went to GoodWill with Abby and bought part of a wedding dress. But our little ""fib"" backfired cause Ray-Ray told everyone he knew that they're getting engaged EEEKK! What was supposed to be small and silly turned&nbsp;into full blown wedding arangements.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#330033>This&nbsp;Sunday should be good cause both Alex (smile) and Kirill are coming over for din-din. And they're meeting everybody and I love little family parties. They make me happy. But unfortunately I'm working all weekend.&nbsp;Oh well I DEFINATELY need the $money$ !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

You are a peaceful and affectionate soul... and by nature rather reserved and analytical. 

The overwhelming strength of the number 7 is reflected in the depth of thinking that is shown.

You will garner knowledge from practically every source that you find. 

Intellectual, scientific and studious, you don't accept a premise until you have dissected the subject and arrived at you own independent conclusion. 



This is a very spiritual number and it often denotes a sort of spiritual wisdom that becomes apparent at a fairly early age. You need a good deal of quiet time to be with your own inner thoughts and dreams. 

You dislike crowds, noise and confusion. 



You are very thorough and complete in your work, the perfectionist who expects everyone else to be a meet a high standard of performance, too. 

You evaluate situations very quickly and with amazing accuracy. 

You rely heavily on your experiences and your intuition, rather than accepting advice from someone.

Your hunches usually prove to be very accurate, and knowing this, you are one who tends to follow the directions they seem to guide. 



It's easy for you to detect deception and recognize insincere people. 

You aren't one to have a wide circle of friends, but once you accept someone as a friend, it's for life. 

You really aren't a very social person, and your reserve is often taken to be aloofness. 

You actually like being alone, away from the hustle and bustle of modern life.

In many ways, you would have fit in better in much earlier times when the pace of life was less hectic.



In the most negative use of the 7 energies, you can become very pessimistic, lackadaisical, quarrelsome, and secretive. 

A Life Path 7 individual who is not living life fully and gaining through experiences.

A negative 7 is  a hard person to live with because of a serious lack of consideration. 

The negative 7 is very selfish and spoiled. 



If you have any of the negative traits they are very difficult to get rid of.

At your worst, you feel that the world really does owe you something - or in some way you aren't being fairly treated. 

Fortunately, the negative 7 is not the typical 7, at least not without some mitigating positive traits. 

This number is one that seems to have some major shifts from highs to lows. 

Stability in feelings may be elusive for you.

I had to go sign up for next semesters classes and explain why I failed 2 out of 3 classes :( Hmmm....&nbsp; 2. My mother thought that my boyfriend of like two days was an alcoholic. hehehe&nbsp;&nbsp;3. I had a few&nbsp;nightmares due to scary movies (Amnityville)&nbsp; 4. I had to go to Boston with my mom and Alex to pick up Abby and friends at the airport coming from Cancun.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Some of my friends seem to be having difficulties getting along with each other ::cough cough::: --Play nice boys and girls--&nbsp; 6. I owe USM $214.00&nbsp; ...plus all my loans.&nbsp;YUCKY!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Oh and my new job is VERY iffy cause they seem a tad bit snobby and don't give me any hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; :(</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#993300> So those are the bad parts of my week...heres the good ones....&nbsp; 1.

I talked to my little Clemmi twice this week (ich liebe dich Clemmi!) &nbsp;3. I have somebody to re-take psychology with (thanks Dan) 4. Abby bought me a wicked pretty ring in Cancun&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks little sis! hahaha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and no. 5. most important I talked to Nathalie my bestest buddy all week!

I was thinking that maybe in my next couple entries I would add in a couple of my very, very short creative writing journal entries....what says people&nbsp;&nbsp; Yay&nbsp; or Nay ?&nbsp; I thought it might be cool a little artistic perhaps- something different anyways....&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh&nbsp; also minor note I will probably be attending my 5th prom in a few weeks LOL&nbsp; Alex wants me to go with him so.... and no prom would ever be complete without my faithful prom companion Amelia!

"event","I feel like I can never be honest with anyone. I feel as though no one really wants me to be honest. Either they don't care enough to hear my crap. Or they don't want to hear anything that may upset them...even if it means a constant nagging pain to me. I feel trapped and tortured a lot of my time. Trapped inside a jar of lies. Tortured by the pressure to say the right thing, do the right thing, be the right person. I don't wanna be that person anymore. I feel repressed- smothered. I can't take it anymore. Being always the way I'm supposed to be! I have done so many things I didn't want to do. I have lied to every person I know at least 10 times...at least. And its not that I don't love them- it's that I do. If I didn't care I wouldn't take the time to lie. 
     I have loved people who could never know. I think about people who I shoudn't. I want to say something, but I can't. I want to tell them I care but instead I walk away. Because I know that someone will get hurt, me or them...but someone. But I am hurting anyways. But I care...
     Then I see people who don't ever seem to care about anyone else. They laugh and flirt as they please...and enjoy life. And I think why can't I be that way? Why do I always try to deny my feelings whileeveryone else has a good time? 
     Gotta go now LOL.....wow <3~Sarah"

She was young and nice and had a few pretty great friends. People liked her pretty well, and she liked them. Uh huh! She did. She had two very good friends named Crytal and Amelia. They were the best of friends. Sarah would dress Amelia up in GoodWill wedding gowns. They would all hang out at Crystals place. It was fairly decent times in the life of Sarah! </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one fateful day, Sarahs friend Ray-Ray introduced Crystal to...**gasp** a crazy guy. Before it could be stopped Crystal had been ""boy-crazyified""! YIKES! She stopped wanting to hang out and try on mildewy dresses. She stopped having time for anyone other than Him! She no longer returned calls, nor meant to. Amelia and Sarah were at a loss for words...they didn't know what to say. They wanted their friend to be happy...but was she? Could she be happy with her every move being watched? How could our once-free-spirited pal Crystal, be alright with being controlled? What could they do?.....</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah and Amelia decided it was time to take matters into their own hands...so on the day of love....(a.k.a Valentines Day, in case you didn't know) they decided to kidnap her and take her away from the scary monster guy...They had to time everything perfectly because she wouldn't have more than two minutes alone all day...and that would be as she was leaving her job at the artist gallery, where she made statue-type edible displays, using meats and vegetables. Amelia and Sarah got there just in time... They told her that they had something to show her in the trunk, she hesitated...she had to get home to Him! She went around back to look and Sarah and Amelia pushed her into the trunk. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They drove around for a while not entirely sure where to take her. Finally they decided to drive down to Florida to see their other friend, Nathalia. Nathalia was soooo happy to see them both...they let crystal out of the trunk. She was a little angry that she had been shoved into a trunk and kidnapped, but she quickly got over it when she saw that she was in sunny Florida with her bestest friends and that they could go swimming, instead of skiing! YAY! So everything worked out in the end...and He found somebody else who really liked being controlled...and all was well in the life of Sarah, Amelia, Crystal, and of course Nathalia!</FONT></STRONG></P>

    Hmmm....Hola Everybody! Well today was my day off from work and school! YAY! Tomorrow I have wonderful French class then I go to work to spend heart day with Chevy. HAHAHA But after that I get to go to the movies wiht Amie and maybe Ray-Ray. Woo Hoo! No romance for me. LOL.... but I will get jelly beans and diet coke. I've decided that I don't like this little livejournal thingy. As I am quite certain it makes me sound like an idiot. 
     Today I slept in till noon. Then I talked to Clemmi, that was cool. Nothing too special came up in the conversation. Then I watched Casablanca with the parents...wonderful. Then I talked to a nice guy named Robert online. He seems cool. Wish I actually knew him. Hehehe Overall though, today was been pretty bland...but I liked it.
     I have realized that I like bland days. :) I remember when I was in like 7th grade and everybody was always wanted me to go out. We'd go to the movies, the beach, and shopping easily all in one day. Well I still like all of those..but spaced out. It seems like thats how most of my activities have become.LOL 
     Ooh baby baby its a wild world......and its hard to get by, just upon a smile girl....
     Ooh baby baby its a wild world......and I'll always remember you as a child girl....
   Gotta love Cat Stevens. It's a shame George Bush kicked him out of the country...I would have liked to see a Cat Stevens concert...Islamic or not...hes great. hehehe Anyways...
   I have to go to sleep now..I just finished two online computer tests. Well HAPPY VALENTINES all you lovers out there! Muah!
Love to All,
   Sarah

  I'll always remember the wonderful times, and strive to forget the bad. :("

I have French class then I have to go into work until 7pm. After that its probably gonna be off to sleep, so I can avoid as much of the evil day as possible. Anyone who knows me, knows that I think <FONT color=#330000>Valentines Day</FONT> is the meanest most heart-breaking day of the year. <FONT color=#000000>I HATE VALENTINES DAY</FONT>! I'm the <FONT color=#330000>V-Day</FONT> scrooge! Never once had a good <FONT color=#330000>Valentines Day</FONT>.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; lol </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So lately I've been online a lot. Talking to people. I like talking online...gives me something to do. Its especially nice when you talk to someone interesting! --Even if they could possibly be some creepy 58 year old bald pervert. They're fun to talk to so.... hehehe. The only thing I hate about talking to people online is that if you DO talk to someone interesting, and you wanna be friends or anything with them..the odds are definately against ever getting to know who they really are. And you also kind of have to wonder what they think of you...like what they think your voice sounds like. But I guess it doesn't matter....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amie and I went out shopping today..went to GoodWill...yay! I got two new shirt thingys and a leather purse. I also molested a mans shirt...thats when you know you've been single too long my friends!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we went to Walmart and I spent too much money on stuff I shouldn't have. Then Amie had to go home :(&nbsp; So I went home and I've been online since..with a few breaks to eat dinner, watch iRobot, and shovel the 20 feet of snow in our drive way! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if anyone I know reads this and happens to have a Sprint cell phone they want to get rid of please tell me! Cause I need a cell&nbsp;phone and I can't get an employee plan w/o a phone. I wanna get a plan before I quit so I can get it real cheap!

<h2>Virgo - Your Love Profile</h2>
<b>Your positive traits:</b>
<br><br>
You're incredibly thoughtful and able to give your partner what they need most.<br>
You are totally logical. You can deal with problems without involving your emotions.<br>
A good work ethic. You'll do whatever it takes (within reason) to make your relationship work.
<br><br>
<b>Your negative traits:</b>
<br><br>
Sometimes you are so focused on your goals that you let your relationships suffer<br>
You tend to be a perfectionist - and expect perfection from your mate as well<br>
You are picky. So picky that you rather be single than with someone who has a few minor faults.
<br><br>
<b>Your ideal partner:</b>
<br><br>
Values success in life as much as you do<br>
Fits a checklist of qualities you've been looking for since childhood<br>
Like you, is more practical and realistic than romantic
<br><br>
<b>Your dating style:</b>
<br><br>
Active. You're a bit hyper, so you'd prefer a date that involved rollerblading in the park or hiking.
<br><br>
<b>Your seduction style:</b>
<br><br>
You may seem a bit shy, but once you open up to someone - you're totally uninhibited<br>
You like to set the scene first - candles, music, nice sheets<br>
A bit obsessed with cleanliness, you may want to shower first with your love
<br><br>
<b>Tips for the future:</b>
<br><br>
Soften up a little. Vulnerability is sexy - and feels great over time.<br>
Lower your standards a little. Look past a messy desk or someone being five minutes late.<br>
Praise your partner more. You make expect them to be successful, but complements are still appreciated.
<br><br>
<b>Best place to meet someone online: </b>
<br><br>
<a href=""http://blogthings.com/eharmony.html"">eHarmony</a> - the best place to find other busy singles looking for a serious relationship

    Hmmm....::ponder, ponder ponder:::

     

    Well I start school tomorrow! YIKES! So not prepared... oh well! No books yet...eh who cares right?

     
     I dyed my hair last night and cut it....it was supposed to be 2 inches shorter and brown - It turned out 5 inches shorter and purply red. LOL It doesn't look too too bad. :) 

 

      
     I'm sooooooooo sick of these dumb people who are obsessed with themselves....but pretend like they're all humble and shiznit! You know the type. They sit around saying blah'd blah blah blah about how their IQ is only 140 and they only get to go to a $30,000/yr school...and how they have to work one day a week. Like a few people I know. Quite good looking-very intelligent guys who probably get asked out every week and yet they come to me and say...""I'm so pathetic....I need a girlfriend...blah blah blah. Its like why don't you just shush! I don't wanna hear it anymore! But mostely I hate stuck-up people. Spoiled. Thinking everyone owes them something. And friends who are only there when they need you and never seem to be ""available"" when you need them.   Or cocky son-of-a-bitches who think they are God's gift to earth, and a certain guy who tells people that he'll be paying for all """"""non-virgins"""""" welfare in a few years. What frigging right do people have to judge others, and use other to make themselves feel better? I hate people who write these clever little poems that really make no sense. They write random statements and think that they may now be compared to Poe and Longfellow...maybe even Shakespeare :) haha     
     
     OK now that I've gone on my tyrant and made myself sound like the biggest bitch I guess I'd better be going. Please don't think any of this is directed towards you!! hehehhe I still love you guys!    Well I g2g! I'll write again soon, from the depths of my insanity!       Love To All~~ <3  Sarah"

Its pretty fun working there, and it doesn't hurt that there are lots of cute guys&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Anywho...where to begin? I guess the most tramatic of my experiences since I last wrote was what happened between me and a friend, I've been good friends with for seven years. This particular friend came like 1500 miles all the way up to Maine. Where she said she was going to spend part of the time living at my house. Well, she got to my house at about 5:30pm and left me, crying, to go see another friend at about 9pm...that was four days ago. She said she would without doubt call that night, and come back over the next day- Nothing. I must admit that I am extremely dissapointed/angry at her. I was her friend for a long time (much longer than the other b****), and I stuck up for her when others wouldn't. And I was very much looking forward to seeing her, especially since I haven't seen her since last Christmas (she ditched me then too)&nbsp; So, what can I say? Obviously this person does not wish to be friends with me, and I am far too sensitive to let anyone treat me so shabbily. So BOO! Forget it all. To quote my best friend Amie....""You think you know someone, until you do""....(Im sure someone else said that too :)&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the upside....my job is going pretty well, it is difficult learning everything I need to know about electronics! I'm not too too great with technology, but I will learn! Oh yeah, did you know that the average cell phone owner talks on their phone&nbsp;579min/mo.? This whole work thing is really getting me back on a schedule, cause I have to get up at 7:45am almost everyday! Which is good. La la la.....So it seems like I'm doing a little better! I hope Clemmi calls me tomorrow! I miss him. I don't know what Im gonna do not being able to have my friend to talk to everyday&nbsp; :(&nbsp;&nbsp; Its very sad when you lose a friend, its like a whole chapter of your life is burned out of your book.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm gonna go...post a comment if you want, that'd be nice :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Love to All&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Sarah</FONT></STRONG></P>"

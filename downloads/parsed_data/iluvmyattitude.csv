"event","You know what i can't stand? is when this guy i work w/ says he wants to hang out w/ me saturday night, and then finds out that he can't b/c he has to eat dinner w/ his mom and her b/f.. well then you were going to hang out with him on sunday. when he gets home from paint-balling.. well he calls me back and says he can't b/c he has to go back to his dads. then i asked him what he was doing tomorrow(monday) and he said nothing. well i said call me.. well it is 8 pm and he didn't call me and when i call his cell phone he don't answer his freaking phone. its not like i'm asking for much. i just want to hang out w/ him.. i like him and he likes me. but whats been happening this weekend makes me think that he don't want to hang out w/ me and that he just might not like me.... hmmm this really makes me think and it really pisses me off...oh well i'll just have to have a little talk w/ him..oh well

      on a lighter note. i had a good weekend. friday night i watched final destination 2. that was really good, really gross, but good. i couldn't sleep that night. but as soon as i laid down in my bed my ex-boyfriend called.. he told me that he didn't even know why he called me, he just did. well he was telling me how much he missed me and all that good stuff. all i really said to him was ""yeah"" ""i know"" ""uh huh"" ""cool"" oh and ""yeah i know"" thats all i really said. i talked but to most of the stuff he said to me was saying yeah, i know, uh huh, cool and yeah i know.. i was just really shocked that he called me from out of the blue.   saturday i went to work and hung out w/ curt the guy i work w/? well before we were about to leave, we went to the back of the shop and we talked and he kissed me. oh and let me tell you it was great.. :)  well like i said before we were supossed to hang out but we didn't. well since i didn't hang out w/ him i went to my friend danny's house to hang out w/ danny and his friend adam.. adam is soo sweet. we went on a walk around danny's block. then i went home at 10pm. well sunday i went to church in the morning, came home, tried to get a hold of curt but noooo i couldn't b/c he was paint-balling. but he finally called me later that day around  6pm and he said let me call you back. well he calls me back and he had to go back to his dads. oh well i ended up going to a movie w/ richard and danny. we saw feddy vs. jason.. richard scared me so many times during the movie. well i got home at 11pm. went to bed. and today (monday) i got up at 10:30am. around noon i called curt but once again i couldn't get a hold of curt. i called him every once in a while and no answer. so yeah i'm not so happy w/ curt at the moment. oh well i guss he is going to have to deal w/ me being a little pissed at him on saturday. or i just might call him after school sometime this week and have a little talk w/ him..  
     well i'm out for now.

THAT WOULD MAKE ME SOOO HAPPY!!!  i hope he does.. but i'm not going to give my hopes up.. cuz what if he doesn't, i would be heart broken....
last saturday when i went to the mall and bought the shirt from gadzooks. the shirt is soo cute it says ""BOYS ARE STUPID.. YOU SHOULD THROW ROCKS AT THEM"" i thought it was funny.well not much has happened between me and the guy i like so i'll tell more later.  buh-bye"

"event","ok, i had my friend jason ask the guy i like if he is single, if he likes anyone, and then i had him put a few good words in for me.. well the guy i like IS single.. i was and still am happy about that. now i can try just a little harder when i flirt w/ him. omg you just don't understand how hott he is. even my mom thinks he's cute..
on saturday i got my ears pierced for the 3rd time. then i told my mom i wanted to go to this store, that just happened to be right next to the store where the guy i like works at, but i said that store just in case he wasn't working. well he was working there. and i said to my mom, ""hey mom do you wanna see what .... looks like?"" she figured out that i really didn't want to go to that store. then i showed her what he looks like. then she said, ""thats the best one yet""  which means she thinks he is cute.  well i had to buy a something so it wouldn't look like i was stalking him or something, so i bought a t-shirt that says, ""boys are stupid.. you should throw rocks at them"" i thought it was really funny. he was the cashier. which means i got to talk to him for a little bit. i was so freakin happy. well i'm gonna go i got homework to do.
i tell more later."

"event","Why is it you can never find the guts to tell someone you like them.  You wanna be with that person, but in reality you really can't be with that person, because you don't know if that person likes you back. Lets say you have a class with that person, you talk to them, and each time you talk to them it makes you like that person even more. But then you get this feeling as if that person likes you back. but you don't know for sure. it's just a feeling.... so how do you know for sure?   you don't thats just it... so can someone please tell me how i can get the ""balls"" to tell someone that i like them....
(the only way you are going to know if that person likes you, is if that person tells you or shows you) thats what i think)
of course if you couldn't tell i really like a guys who just happens to be REALLY REALLY hott, and really nice. but idk if he feels the same towards me. every once in a while i get this feeling that he likes me but thats just a feeling. errrrrr. idk what to do...  idk if i shold tell him that i like him or wait until i have stronger feelings for him and then tell him. what should i do... this is all to confusing.... 
  life is pretty good. i've been in a lot of good moods lately... which is really great.... schools ok i guess since i have a class with the guys that i like which is really great..... but i'm goint to go i'll update later about the guy situation..buh-bye
dude unwritten law is great"

"event","well for the past few days i've had fun. saturday night i went to my school dance. i danced a lot. now my legs hurt, but thats ok. but it was worth it. i just got off of the phone w/ my friend and her baby's daddy is being a jerk. and she wants to tell him not to come any where close to her or her baby. i think she should do that, b/cuz of what he said to someone and it got back to her and now she is REALLY mad and she has every right to be mad. but oh well.. 

why is it that guys do one thing and then tell your friend that he only likes you as a friend. only when you know he is lying to her and you are sitting right there. that just makes me mad. this guy that did this is always tell ME he likes me and tell my friend something different. i don't understand guys but hey they don't understand girls. so i guess it all works out even.
FINALS ARE THIS WEEK AND I HATE TEST THIS SUCKS MONKEY BALLS"

 my friend,adam, that lives down the street from me is going out w/ this girl and i think he could do so much better than her. but i'm going to let make his own choices. school day was ok. the guy that likes/liked me won't even talk to me and i don't know why, but i wish i knew. but oh well i will eventually find out."

"event","well i just got home from church and that was fun! It was actually the first time my ex wasn't there in a long time he normally goes, but tonight he didn't go. Maybe he had somegthing to do. My friend and i brought someone w/ us to church and she had fun which is awesome. Neways. like i said earlier guys are trouble. there is this guy at church and he doesn't go to church very often so he doesn't know how to act. today he was calm instead he normally is really talkative. so i think he kinda knows how to act. which is good. but the thing is, i think he is going to church to meet girls which is not the reason to go to church. but idk

i really don't want to go to school tomorrow. i might have to give a speech in front of the class. i hate doing these things. plus lunch food sucks monkey balls. lol my friend at church is pregnant and she is finally showing which is awesome i can't wait until she has here baby.
i'm getting tired so i'm going to bed soon"

"event","why is it that guys can't make up their minds? (ok, i know girls can't make up their mind either)i like 2 guys, one i've know for like ever and the other i just met this year. the one i met this year is being a butt head and i don't know why, but oh well. some guys at my school(ok most guys) are jerks and really immature, i can't stand it.

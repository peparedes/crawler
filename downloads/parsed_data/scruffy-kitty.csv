<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> This powers speaks pretty<br>much for itself. Though you don't need wings<br>for this power,you can fly anyway. Some people<br>may consider it as telekinesis since they can<br>also fly, but you can't make material things<br>move like they can. This ability could be a<br>relaxing activity when you want to get away<br>from everyday troubles. Also it is good when<br>sneaking upon an enemy since it makes no sound.<br>When going over to the ""dark side""<br>the power could be used to harrass and break<br>into building through windows etc.<br>You are quite similar to this power since you<br>like to have your head in the clouds.<br>Supernatural things amuse while ordinary life<br>does not. If your daydreaming has gotten a<br>little too far you might be zooned out all the<br>time, even when you are having a conversation.<br>Your desires and/or goals tend to be<br>unrealistic even if you know those would<br>probably never happen. Travelling is something<br>you would be interested in doing since seeing<br>exotic scenery fits with your fantasies of<br>escaping your plain life. You can also have<br>some creative ability (writer, playing an<br>instrumen etc) that interests you.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> The whole reason you<br>may be escaping life could be fear of being let<br>down by it. So if that would come to happen,<br>and an important dream had been crushed you<br>could get depressed.</p>

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/Q/Quickstrike9/1122282788_cturesWind.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Wind""><br>Wind. You can be a little unsure of yourself at<br>times, but once you're steadied, you provide<br>solid support to those around you.

Personality: You're far more muted than any of the<br>others but that isn't a bad thing. Winds might<br>fall behind pace when discovering who they<br>really are, but once you know, you'll be one of<br>the kindest and most caring people someone<br>could ever ask for. One of the reasons it takes<br>you a little longer to find yourself is because<br>you always put others first. Some people might<br>think youre a pushover and you can be a little<br>too trusting. But you just want to find the<br>good in everyone. When youve helped those<br>around you become better or happier people,<br>youll find your own problems a lot easier to<br>deal with. Youll learn to relate better to<br>yourself once you take your external<br>experiences and apply them internally.

Temper: Honestly? You don't have much of one. When<br>cornered, you tend to pull back and shy from<br>confrontation. However, if you're pushed, your<br>muscles will begin to coil and youll find your<br>teeth. As soon as an opening presents itself,<br>you'll take it. That means that if people want<br>to get a highly emotional reaction from you,<br>they'll have to push. But it also means that<br>their strategy might blow up in their face when<br>you give them your gut-honest reaction instead<br>the answer they were looking for. People will<br>try and get you to cave in, so remember that<br>just because they're louder doesn't mean<br>they're right. Look to the many people youve<br>helped to remind you just how strong you are.

The Other Elements:
Earth: Your elemental opposite. Stay away. Stay far<br>away. Earth is stubborn, emotional, and<br>aggressive. Because they have a tendency to<br>think more about themselves than others, guilt<br>takes a while to catch up with them so don't be<br>surprised if they end up taking advantage of<br>you. Approach with caution. Your trusting<br>nature with make you want to help them, but try<br>steering them towards another element before<br>you tackle the task yourself.
Water: Your elemental equal. You have a lot in<br>common with Wind which makes for smooth and<br>quickly built relationships. Wind and Water are<br>a force to be reckoned with when working<br>together. But because it comes so easy, Water<br>might take it for granted and the relationship<br>can easily become superficial. Keep them<br>ground. When they get a little too caught up<br>with material possessions, remind them what's<br>really important. But keep in mind that Water<br>can help you loosen up and have a litle fun.
Fire: Not your opposite but not your equal either.<br>Like a relationship with those of your own<br>element, relationships with Fire are often<br>hit-or-miss. Fire can be scary at first, but if<br>you stay calm and patient, giving them a<br>chance, you'll recognize the same loyalty in<br>them that you have in yourself. You both have<br>pulled back personalties, but Fire is cautious,<br>not withdrawn. Ask and you can gain invaluable<br>tips on being a bit more assertive.

You are an angel of death who lurks in the shadows.<br>Dark, brooding, mysterious, and deeply pensive,<br>you lead a solitary life. You tend to be rather<br>stoic; others see you as a cold and stony ice<br>queen, but hey, you're just doing your job.

<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> Unlike everyone else you<br>can change your body materia and transform into<br>anything (e.g. an animal). This can be used in<br>good purposes for infiltrating evil<br>headcuarters or adjust your physical abilities<br>by transforming and therefor do better in<br>battle. If turned to the evil side, a<br>transfomer could manipulate the ""good<br>guys"" by looking like their loved ones and<br>break them down.<br>As a person you are dissapointed with life. You<br>have not so many interests anymore and has<br>become depressed. Of course you can be happy,<br>but your happiness subsides quickly and don't<br>last very long. You isloate yourself from<br>people since you think they would only hurt<br>you, but some part just wants someone equal who<br>understands the pain. When you transform it<br>gives you freedom and you can be anything but<br>yourself. You often pity yourself but don't let<br>people come near and know what's going on with<br>you. But the thought of opening up and risking<br>being betrayed is too strong and intimidating<br>to even try.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> You carry much hate to<br>the world and yourself and in the long run this<br>could lead to dangerous thoughts<br>(suicide/cutting/killing) though the last one<br>is least likeable since you would probably just<br>have too much guilt. </p>

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/N/nekokittychi/1075175161_uizzesRain.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Rain""><br>Your element is Rain: Sad, lonely, distant and<br>unique. You are quite distant from emotion and<br>people, but you have been made this way by one<br>thing or another. You are truly unique yet fail<br>to see it, and are quite creative be it in art,<br>music, writing, ect.. You used to let people in<br>now you don't even bother to try having been<br>hurt so many times in the past. Your attitude<br>is that you don't need anyone but yourself,<br>people are just trouble waiting to happen. But<br>you really do want to trust someone no matter<br>if you see it or not, deep down your waiting<br>for someone to come and set you free. This kind<br>of depression can turn dangerous, don't let<br>them get to you. Not everyone in the world will<br>hurt you, humans are humans and are not<br>perfect. So most likely sooner or later you'll<br>meet someone who feels like you do and perhaps<br>your shell will eventually disappear.

Quite solitary and<br>somewhat shy around people because you prefer<br>animals and plants, animals aren't afraid to<br>show themselves or what they are feeling and<br>plants are fun to nurture. You are very strong<br>in your silence if you set your mind on<br>something you will often times pursue it to the<br>end. Sometimes you just want to get away, so<br>you seek refuge in the forest where you can<br>have time to think and try to sort out your<br>emotions. The sound of the wind usually calms<br>you, especially moving through the trees. Life<br>to you is something precious and should not be<br>taken for granted.

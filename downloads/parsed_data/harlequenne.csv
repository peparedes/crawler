"event","I went to USI this weekend for a visit: I'm probably getting a scholarship from them.  

But there was a lot of beer.
Now, for one thing: beer, tastes like piss smells.  And college boys apparently drink lots and lots and lots of it.  That will suck, hardcore.  I hate it.  Why do you have to be drunk to have fun?  I've been drunk: all I did was skateboard off a roof and almost drown.  I've seen drunk people: they are stupider than usual.  And most of them can't stand to be much dumber.

And my store's closing.  I have to find a new job that will take me with the stipulation that I'll be gone when August comes. Probably more like July. 

I don't wanna leave.  I like it.  
Hell."

"event","My cousin called me like twenty minutes ago, complaining that she had gained weight.  She is very, VERY skinny girl, and me...not so much so.  But she was really upset about it, and that made me kinda sad.

I used to have a friend, Jeremi.  He was amazing, and I loved him with all my heart.  But I used to complain to him about my weight like Chelsey does to me now.  He always laughed at me, and then he gave me a hug, and grabbed hold of my love handles.  Still have 'em.  But he always told me they were one of his favorite parts of me.  That made me feel really, really pretty.  But i can't say that to my cousin.  she'll think I'm weird.  I just...hate to hear girls say they're fat.  Say that they're ugly.

I love my lovehandles."

"event","Eh.  So where to begin?  I'm exhausted, I'm sore and I'm in a bitchy sort of way.  I shouldn't be, but you know how it is.

I never really liked Christmas a whole lot to begin with.  I just...had issues with why anyone able to afford presents for every little kid in the world would be giving them away.  He HAD to want something.  
But now I work retail. Oh yes, I work in a mall record store.  I spend at least 6 hours a day listening to canned Christmas music and whiny mini-van moms, trying to calculate how many papercuts it would take to end my life.  Then I come home, I take a shower.  My mom gets home.  And what does she say?

""Honey, lets go to the mall and finish my Christmas shopping!""

(insert sounds of slow and painful gurgling DEATH)

And no.  Not going is not an option.  Because I'm leaving in seven or eight months.  For college.  Five hours away.  How incredibly sad.  

So when we went Christmas shopping.  And there was this little...kid.  Like six or seven little.  And apparently, he found me incredibly fascinating, because he followed me ALL OVER THE MALL.  His mom was there, she was following him wherever this little brat dragged her.  So my mom drags me into Victoria's secret and this kid drags his mom into Victoria's Secret.  Oh My God.  By the time my mom was done, I'd lost the kid.  I found him again by the door.  With a DD bra, one cup of it on his head.  

I finally lost him as the secuity alarms went off and the Vicki bouncers tackled the little bastard flat."

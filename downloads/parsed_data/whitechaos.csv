"event","Mummy...Johnny brought a gun to school
He told his friends that it was cool
And when he pulled the trigger back
It shot with a great crack
Mummy I was a good girl
I did what I was told
I went to school, I got straight A's, I even got the gold
But mummy when I went to school that day, I never said goodbye
I'm sorry mummy I had to go, but mommy please don't cry
When Johnny shot the gun he hit me and another
And all because he got the gun from his older brother
Mummy please tell daddy that I love him very much
And please tell Chris, my boyfriend, that it wasn't just a crush
And tell my little sister that she is the only one now
And tell my dear sweet grandmother that I'll be waiting for her now
And tell my wonderful friends that they were always the best
Mummy I'm not the first I'm no better than the rest
Mummy tell my teachers I won't show up for class
And never to forget this and please don't let this pass
Mummy why'd it have to be me no one deserves this
Mummy warn the others, mummy I left without a kiss
And mummy tell the doctors I know they really did try
I think I even saw a doctor trying not to cry
Mummy I'm slowly dying with a bullet in my chest
But mummy please remember I'm in heaven with the rest
Mummy I ran as fast as I could when I heard that crack
Mummy listen to me if you would
I wanted to go to college
I wanted to try things that were new
I guess I'm not going with daddy
On that trip to the new zoo
I wanted to get married
I wanted to have a kid
I wanted to be an actress
Mummy I wanted to live
But mummy I must go now
The time is getting late
Mummy tell my Chris
I'm sorry but I had to cancel the date
I love you mummy I always have
I know you know it's true
Mummy all I wanted to say is ""mummy I love you""
In memory of the Columbian students that were lost
Please if you would
Pass this around
I'd be happy if you could
Don't smash this on the ground
If you pass this on
Maybe people will cry
Just keep this in heart
For the people that didn't get to say ""goodbye"""

My name is Sarah
I am but three,
My eyes are swollen
I cannot see
I must be stupid
I must be bad,
What else could have made
My daddy so mad?
I wish I were better
I wish I weren't ugly,
Then maybe my mommy
Would still want to hug me.
I can't speak at all
I can't do a wrong
Or else I'm locked up
All the day long
When I awake I'm all alone
The house is dark
My folks aren't home.
When my mommy does come
I'll try and be nice,
So maybe I'll get just
One whipping tonight
Don't make a sound!
I just heard a car
My daddy is back
From Charlie's Bar.
I hear him curse
My name he calls
I press myself
Against the wall.
I try and hide
From his evil eyes
I'm so afraid now
I'm starting to cry.
He finds me weeping
He shouts ugly words,
He says it's my fault
That he suffers at work.
He slaps me and hits me
And yells at me more,
I finally get free
And I run for the door.
He's already locked it
And I start to bawl,
He takes me and throws me
Against the hard wall.
I fall to the floor
With my bones nearly broken,
And my daddy continues
With more bad words spoken.
""I'm sorry,"" I scream
But it's now much too late
His face has been twisted
Into unimaginable hate.
The hurt and the pain
Again and again
Oh, please God, have mercy!
Oh please let it end!
And he finally stops
And heads for the door
While I lay there motionless
Sprawled on the floor.
My name is Sarah
And I am but three,
Tonight my daddy,
Murdered me."

Requiem means Mass (or song) for the dead


Red, such a dangerous color
Is now a hazy mist before my eyes
Blocking all of my senses
I can literally feel my mind crumble
It started out as nothing but a dull ache in my head
As I watched you spilling silent tears
...I was worried about you
Of course I was...
You just told me that you wouldn't mind dieing
That you would take me with you
What would you do if someone you loved said that to you?
You've no idea?
Not many do...
I too had no idea as to what to do
So I let go, I let my emotions take control
Who knew that would be such a bad thing to do?
That intoxicating red haze grew
It filled my mind
My throat
My eyes
I put my hand to my mouth as a choking sound emitted
You thought I was crying
...How cute...
The person I thought I had always loved
I found that I really only despised
For some reason...
I found this funny
HOW IRONIC!
The very person I had slaved away over
Just to make sure she was HAPPY!
She wanted to die
he he he he HA HA HA...
The laughter rang throughout the room 
Echoing in your ears
Rattling you brain
Bringing a shiver to your spine
And a chill to your heart
I hated you 
Oh god!...how I hated you
Your tears no longer meant anything to me
I was crying too
But they were the type of tears that appeared
when you laughed too hard
I left you there
My laughter trailing behind me 
leaving the room with a vile feel to it
The last thing I saw of you
was the horrified look on your face
That made me laugh even harder if 
it was even possible
As I continued on my way to nowhere
Or maybe it was to hell
I don't really know...
I thought this of you
...How insignificant
Go ahead and die little one
Let my laughter be your requiem"

Why? What is it that makes it so damn hard?
Why can't I just call him and say ""Dad, I hate you!"" 
I can say that right now, why can't I say it to you?
I mean I can't even write a letter telling you that.
I'M ANGRY AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!!!
I mean you left. Left...just like that. 
The last time I saw you....damn it,
it was from me happening to see you outside the car window.
That's right, happening, as in by pure chance. No warning. 
Now if I was being rational right now I would be thinking, 
""How would you tell your four year old daughter that you
were divorced now and you had to leave."" 
Then my irrational side would say, 
""If you loved me you would have stayed. 
Not smiled and waved like everything was gonna be okay."" 
You know what I remember that day so well. 
You know, I remember whispering in my head 
""...wait,....don't leave me..please..."" 
Now you're getting remarried. 
That wasn't so bad. 
I mean I know you told me her name like 
five times already and I keep forgetting. 
I know you might be just a tad angry at that, 
but you know...did you ever think that 
I don't want to remember her STUPID NAME?!?! 
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?! 
WHAT...what if I wanted to forget? 
What if I wanted to you to know
...to understand JUST how much I suffered? 
How my family suffered, which by the way, 
I no longer include you as a part of. 
Like I said it wasn't so bad,
...until you talked about having kids. 
You said something about me might having to be a big sister. 
My world blew apart. 
Right then.

The voices of those around me
Every voice is so different
There is so much color and 
sound that makes up one voice alone.
The color of a voice can range
from green to gray
It can make you feel like you're looking 
at the first snow against a blue winter sky
You could see a fire engulfing everything in
it's path, to caress 
everything it catches with pain
So much pain...
But with your voice 
I see the color of gentle bronze
That matches your eyes so perfectly
So much so that I don't know whether I'm
lost within the swimming depths of your eyes
or drunk off of the sweet sound of your voice
The combination confuses me so that 
I can't tell up from down
The only reason why I'm still standing
Is because you're still holding me up 
And the sound, oh the sound of your voice
It's so different...
A voice can sound like thunder 
or the tiniest bell
It can sound like a playful breeze 
playing among the branches of trees
Like a child's laughter
Or woman's scream
Listening to yours makes 
me feel like I'm in a dream
A dream that I don't want to escape
That traps me, makes me feel safe.
And as long as you speak 
those sweet nothings in my ear
I'll have to thrust my heart 
into your hands to steer.
I'm like your puppet attached 
to those little strings
Wondering exactly what 
the next act will bring
And so this evening closes 
with a last saying from you
""If nothing lasts forever, 
and if this saying is true,
let me be your nothing,
let me be your groom."""

"event","The Soliloquy Of 'Some of Us'


I realized something today.
I'm envious.
I'm angry.
And I'm tired.
But most of all...I'm selfish.
You know how I figured that one out?
I was thinking to myself how lucky some people are
And how they never seem to realize it.
Because you know...there are some of us
that don't look handsome smiling.
We don't look beautiful when we cry.
Some of us won't get to experience love
from that certain someone.
We're not gonna look good no matter how long
we stand in front of our mirrors.
Some of us aren't gonna get that 'I'm-checking-you-out' once over from a pretty girl.
Some of us aren't gonna have some guy walk up to us, 
look us straight in the eyes, and say so sincerely
""You're beautiful.""
We're not gonna get it. 
And I'm sure this happens to both boys and girls.
Did you know that it feels good when someone actually notices that you are in fact a girl or a guy?
It feels relieving, or it would,... if it ever happened.
Know what else?
Some of us don't have talent.
We aren't going to get a moment of recognition.
No ones gonna say ""Wow, that was incredible!"" and then mean it.
You know what they're gonna say?
""Good Job."" 
All the while thinking 'What a waste of time.'
When that happens some of us feel like all we're doing
is taking up space and air.
We don't ever feel like we did something worthy of 
notice.
And you know what?
You'd think we brains to fall back on.
Well we were told just like you I'm sure,
""If you put your mind to it, you can become anything you want to be.""
That's a load of bull if I ever heard one.
Did you notice?
Did you see?
When some of us put all our minds, our souls, and hearts, into something we still fall short?
Do you know how much it hurts to have studied for 
something all night and then someone says to you
I just read it.
Or maybe they said, I just took notes,
Or my personal favorite, I just listened.
And then while you're sitting over there with a C
that you studied all night for,
and they have an A
do you know how much that hurts?
Do you know how it feels when it seems like no matter what you do, you're just falling behind?
This really does happen to some of us.
Some of us are so unlucky that we
have to deal with all of it.
You must be wondering,
""What does this have to do with 
you being selfish now?""
Well, as soon I thought all of this, 
I realized that I too was fortunate.
I was rich with family and friends.
...Of course there were those thoughts.
You know, (or maybe you don't)... those thoughts 
that say to you ""I wonder if all those times 
your friends said jokingly 
""Man, you are so stupid,"" 
were really just said in jest, or if they had a ring of truth?
And what about your parents? Do they really care about you 
or are they saying ""I love you"" over and over 
not only to convince you, but also themselves?
Of course we always bypass those thoughts,
because that's all we've got.
Do you want to know how you can recognize one of us?
You'll know us by our masks which show only our eyes
made beautiful with our tears; 
the current style for us...
is the never ending smile,
while inside we're whispering so desperately:
""Save me"" 
So be on the look out.
Who knows,...maybe you can rescue some of us...
We need it..."

Note that the tragedy IS my style. The love part isn't cause it's hard for me to write. ....GOD DON'T YOU JUST LOVE MY RAMBLINGS!!! I KNOW I DO!!! Okay, anyway, here we go. Flames are not so welcome, but I need them anyway. So have at it. Oh, by the way, this is going to be told from the point of view of an old person. I say person because I don't care if it's a man or woman. You choose whichever you want and be happy. 


The Legend of the Sakura Trees


I have heard many a person ask why? What made them that color? Was it the sun or the moon? Was it the heat, the humidity, the chill? Not many are sure what made the Sakura Blossoms bloom in the color of sunrise. As if the very reason they grew on trees was so that they may be able to reach up and join the dawn sky in the celebration of a new day. No one knows....except for me of course. If I didn't know, I wouldn't be sitting here about to tell you this tragedy. Now where shall I begin? Well, your response would be ""At the beginning, naturally."" Fine, at the beginning it is.

Once upon a time (I know the the saying is old and used, but like it or not I'm old. Deal with it!)there lived a man and a woman (no, this is not Adam and Eve. I know not their names. Once again, deal with it!)who loved each other very much. There love was so intense that they would gladly die for each other if the opportunity presented itself. Or,...so they thought. 

One day all of the men from the region were called to war. Though they grieved at the thought at having to leave each other, they both knew that the man must serve his country. The woman said to him before he left ""I will wait for you here, until the end and after."" He simply smiled knowing that she would do just as she said she would. 'Here' happened to be their special place. Where they first met, under the Tsubasa tree. Named as such because of the pure white blossoms that stretched towards the heavens like an angel's wings. 

So, the man left for the shadows of war and thus the man became a warrior. A warrior that fought many a bloody battle. Each one chipping at his mind and heart. So much so that his mind became it's own war between sanity and insanity, while his heart lost it's initial luster and became nothing more than a pump that kept him alive only to face another battle. Battle after battle and yet the war waged on. And so the warrior became a madman.

All this time the woman had kept her promise. Rising early in the morning to eat, walk the long way to the Tsubasa tree, and wait until late past midnight, only to walk home, eat, and sleep until early dawn just to repeat the process. Day after day she waited and day after day her perseverance was rewarded with only grievance and a painful yearning.

Finally, after eight long years, the war ended, taking with it many lives that were cherished and eventually forgotten in order to also forget the pain that lingered. The only one that clung to the pain was the one that wanted it, needed it in order to remember. Remember her promise.

A few months passed and the warrior turned madman returned late one night, to where the fragments of his memories began. The Tsubasa tree. The madman was tired and blinded with fear. He was currently dealing with what every warrior has to deal with. Seeing the faces of perpetual fear, anger, and shock across the faces of his slaughtered comrades and enemies covered in the crimson fluid that was blood along with hearing the screams of pain that rang across the battlefield. 

Because of this he was not very focused and was unable to see without first seeing red. Upon his reaching the tree he heard something soft among the screams. A small gasp.  The gasp belonged to his lover from long ago. She had heard the shuffling of tired feet on the road and was going to see if anything was wrong and if she could help, when she saw him. Her love had returned at last. She was so happy and relieved that she ran towards him, tears streaming down her face.

This did not sit well with him as what he saw at the moment was another potential enemy. ""Leave me alone!"" he screamed as he thrust his sword forward with as much strength as he could muster. Feeling the familiar sensation of the blade piercing through flesh and catching on bone, he smiled and in that moment he lost the war of his mind. But then he got a look at the face of his 'enemy' only for his own face to slip into an expression of shock and utter fear upon the realization of what he had just done to his beloved.

There she was against the hilt of his blade, but out if all the other expressions he had seen on the faces of those that died by the blade none was as gentle as this. Her face portrayed that of forgiveness, relief, and the love she felt for him. It told him so much without saying anything. 

Gently he removed the blade from her body. As he lowered her to the ground underneath the Tsubasa tree, he watched her calm and loving smile while tears began to appear in eyes long dry. As her blood soaked the ground, she spoke her final words in gasping breaths. ""I ....love..y.you"" She whispered, stumbling over her words as she lay dying. And with that she expelled her last breath shakily. He finally released his tears. 

The only reason he had lived was to be able to see her again. To stay with her. Grow old with her. Out of all the memories he had lost, this he remembered. But now she was gone, vanished right in front of his eyes. There was no more reason for him to live and so he took his sword and plunged it into his heart. Thus he started his journey to the gates of heaven to join his beloved. 

As they departed from the world there scarlet life stream soaked into the ground. The tree's roots absorbed the fluid as though it was precious water. The blood that the tree took in tainted the blossoms and the seeds they possessed. The white color of the blossoms and the deep red of the lover's blood mixed together to create the pink of the blossoms you see today. The Tsubasa trees were renamed and became known as the Sakura trees from that day onward. The seeds from that tree spread, overtaking all the others. No one knows what happened to the bodies. Many assume that they were swallowed into the ground along with their blood and it seems that they were right. 

So if anyone asks you why the Sakura Trees imitate the dawn sky, tell them this: A corpse lies beneath the roots, tainting the blossoms and seeds.

That is all there is to say of the Sakura trees. Now let an old one rest, for I shall leave this world as well very soon. Perhaps I will be buried underneath the trees and paint them the color of the dawn skies.

NOTES: Now I have actually heard a saying about Sakura trees. The saying was ""A skeleton lies underneath the Sakura trees."" When I heard this I just thought up this story. However, that was years ago, but I was able to remember it for sssoooooo long so I just went ahead and wrote (er...typed) it down. I know it's not too good, (probably really bad) but oh well...So sorry if it was a disappointment. ^_^;"

"event","So Tired...


Lately, I have started to feel like I did when I was in my old school.
You know, that odd type of depression where all you want to do is sleep.
That's how I feel these days. 
Frankly I'm surprised at the energy that I show at school. 
I can laugh somewhat easily, but at the same time I want to go to sleep or the other me reminds me by asking ""Is it really okay to laugh right now?"" 
You're so close to eighteen and your mom's promise will run out anytime now. 
What are you gonna do then?
What will you do when she leaves? 
At that point my exhaustion gives way to anger and threatening tears.
Sometimes I even start to feel sick. 
At first I thought I was just incredibly lazy, but now I'm not certain. 
Oh well, I guess I just need to keep smiling. 
Besides there are so many other people that have it worse than me. 
It makes me sick how I complain about my problems when my friends are feeling down too. 
Not to mention all the people I've never heard of before. 
I know that sounds weird. 
I'm sure some of you wonder ""What are you so upset over them for? 
You don't even know them! 
You just start feeling sorry for random people everywhere?"" 
Well, yeah I do. 
I don't want to, but I do. 
I mean every single time I feel sorry for myself I think of maybe some of the kids my mom works with. 
Most younger than me and they're going through crappy problems like their parents actually committed suicide or someone murdered someone close to them right in front of their eyes. 
Maybe no one pays them any attention. 
That doesn't seem like anything at first, but then when it gets so bad that no one cares that you're crying or that you need help and no on does anything it gets kinda bad then now doesn't it. 
There are parents that aren't good role models (they steal and curse in front of their two year olds who then pick it up, or they find GF's or BF's who hang around the wrong crowd and get themselves killed). 
So yeah, I do feel guilty for feeling this way most of the time. 
Because of that I don't really allow my self to cry. 
Selfishly, I won't allow myself to cry because of that and because of the fact that I start to choke every time it happens. 
I'm afraid to grow up because I might be all alone then, whether by my own doing or not. 
Sometimes I get scared because I catch my self thinking that might be better sometimes. 
If I were alone I wouldn't have to worry about anyone else and I could be selfish all I want. 
However, I always shake myself out of this type of thinking. 
What am I gonna do? 
What am I supposed to do? 
Where am I supposed to go? 
I'm afraid of what will happen when I break. 
There is no ""if"", cause I know I will. 
But what will happen then?
...Too much thinking. 
If I can will myself to sleep it will all go away. 
Though it won't take much will-power to do that.
To sleep...
I just want it to all fade away. 
So that's what I'm gonna do. 
I'm going to sleep, then the confusion will be lost in the darkness.
...Just like me."

By the way I LUV the changes made to Riku. He looks sooo much better now (the hair I mean, plus the serious face, hate his clothes though not to mention how he runs)!

"event","The Thoughts Of A Tormented Child

A dark day for the cherished.
All I had experienced this day were
""boo-hoo""s from people who knew nothing of you;
fake ""I'm sorry""s from those who simply didn't care;
and supposedly sympathetic hugs that had no feeling.
All of them wondering the same thing, ""Why isn't she crying?"" and ""Doesn't she care that her mom just died?""
If I'd had more tears to shed you'd have a waterfall instead of a river.
But the dead can't cry, (of course with you being dead you already know this)
and I've just joined the ranks of the living dead, and let me tell you, we're growing in number. 
When I left the funeral (heh, funeral, such a funny word. It has everything to do with death and yet it has the word ""fun"" in it) all I could think of was the promise that I made to myself.
The one where I tell everyone how much you'd hurt me all those years.
I'd tell them that you hit me only once, but you never really had to hit me to see my tears.
I would tell them of my memories of you.
How you used to kiss my forehead out of the love you had for me.
Then as I grew older, it seemed like you only kissed me because it felt like it was your duty to make sure I was able to keep my sanity as you sank deeper into depression. Of course, being four at the time, I didn't understand that. 
It wasn't until seven that I actually started to comprehend your dark corner of the world. 
Then I would tell them of how you used to tell me of your day and tell me you loved me before I went to sleep. 
After that, I would tell them that as I grew, you would sing me a lullaby. 
All of them filled with screams of ""I JUST WANT TO DIE ALREADY!"" 
Those were the lullabies that I fell asleep to. 
Then I would tell them of how you would go into my grandmother's room with what seemed like thousands of pills in your hand and say ""I'm going to take these if you make me leave this house ever again."" 
I would tell them of how I would spend the night feverishly praying that you wouldn't do it. 
That you would come to your senses. 
It seems that God listened to me because you always did. 
Finally I'd tell them of the time God had taken a day off or perhaps he'd called in sick, because after a long night of prayer the very next day I found you dead, an empty bottle of pills by your side.
After telling them of the truth, I'd ask the questions I had wanted to ask you those long twelve years, but didn't because I was afraid of your answers. 
The questions would be ""What did I do? Were you not satisfied? Was it because I wasn't pretty like so many girls? Or maybe that I wasn't smart? Could it have been my lack of talent? Did you simply grow tired of me?"" 
And when my audience gave me no answer, I'd laugh. 
And what a bitter laugh it would be. 
While I laughed, (such a bitter one indeed) I would answer myself instead.
""It was all of it, wasn't it? Yes....., all of that was the reason for your hate.""
But you know what?
I haven't told anyone.
I'm still keeping everything inside.
Maybe the world will never know.
And to think, all I wanted was for you to love me for me and not for what I could have become.
That had been wishful thinking, I suppose.
After I finish all my little imaginings, I come to realize my face is wet.
Touching my cheek, I draw back my hand to stare at what remains of a tear, only to feel more of them slide down my face.
It seems that even though I feel dead; I still have some tears to shed.
Looks like you'll get that waterfall anyway."

Yeah, sorry not a happy topic. 

Another question, what happens when that mother asks the child to let her go? How can the child respond to that?

.....Wow, am I on a roll.

Sorry people, maybe I'll be happy another time."

"event","I'm at school right now and I should be studying for my english final, but I really don't want to.  Oh well.

I'm a little worried about Kantama cause she doesn't seem to be doing so good at the moment. I'm gonna try to call her tonight. Her entry was on the 12th but this is the 14th. *sigh* I've been studying so much lately that the only thing I get online for is to study the online websites for these textbooks. It had better be worth it, damn it. 

Other than that everything seems to be doing okay. Sorta. Little angsty I suppose. I just hope I did okay on my music final. Oh well, I'll pray on it and maybe I'll get by okay. -_-;; I hope anyway. 

Tim Bryant or Bigg T burned some of his remixes on a CD for me, and let me tell you I LUV them. It's all cool and creepy at the same time. Great beat in my opinion. However, it is adding to my angst at the moment, but oddly enough I like songs like that. I know ...... I'm weird. 

I don't want to go to next period. Evil finals. I got my pics back today. Did I ever mention that I bought my yearbook picture? I guess I didn't, oh well. I got them back. They look okay I guess. My friend Samiria literally dragged me into the bathroom and fixed my hair and put colorful lip balm on me. Ugh... I hate lip balm with color. Oh well,....again.

I found out that on the SAT practice run I made a 93 on the math portion. I was like wow....Are you sure that it's not someone else's paper? But It was mine. I passed everything else with a B except for Science. That I made a TEN on. How lame. If I had passed that one I would have skyrocketed. The only reason I think I made those grades are because I kept putting B & C on everything. I know sad. ^_^;; 

I just hope I can make the same grades on the real SAT. Well...maybe not the ten. Yeah......"

i'm so incredibly pissed at my ex and his ex. because they are both back stabbing bastards. im so mad im almost at the point of hate. but i'm not going to go that far even if i want to.  i want them both to know that it hurt, but that's not going to make me a better person in the long run, if anything it will make me worse.  but my most sincere wish is that the golden rule is true, but a trillion times worse."

"event","OMG, Shadow of Colossus is so cool. The guy is cute, I want to hug the horse ( I think its name is Argo, or something like that) It is so beautiful. The graphics are the best I've ever seen. But the monsters are huge!!!!! Their the size of a skyscraper! AT LEAST!!!!!!!! You only get two weapons to destroy them. A sword and a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows. To find the Colossus you have to raise your sword and find the place where the light focuses. It took me a while to understand that. The worse thing is that if you are holding on to a ledge or something or if you are doing an attack that requires a lot of strength then your ""grip control"" starts to drain. If you let go it can recharge but you have to be in a safe place or the colossus will take the time to hit you. And the blows take up a lot of the little HP you have. I don't know if you ever get more HP or not. Jeez I only had the demo people!I'm looking for the place I can buy it now though. I can't wait!!!! ^____________________________________________^"

"event","I had that dream again...I don't know why I have it. I don't know what it could mean, but this is the third time. I start out in the car with my mother and grandmother, but I can't see their faces, I mean there is a haze over just their faces. I know, weird.       
     Another weird thing is that I know where I am in the dream. It's an actual street in reality. I don't know the name of the street but I pass through it almost everyday, but there was no grass, and no land. You could only see the land where the buildings and a few trees were, then it all fell away to air. The road we were on was no longer a road, but a ramp in the air and there was traffic all around us. The sky was a purple red which faded into a light gold. There were no clouds, only sky. 
     As soon as I finished this observation I realized that the ramp was shaking. When I looked up I saw that it had collapsed under some of the cars in front of us. I saw the people fall out of their car, but I heard no screams. This kept happening for a while in front and in back of us. I told a friend of mine that we had been blocked by traffic so we couldn't move, but we did have some room. In fact the cars were widely spaced. Despite this, when the cement began to crumble beneath us, no on moved. No one seemed aware. Then again no one seemed to be alive. When the car fell I felt myself lifted out of the car and found myself free falling and watching as the car fell away to the violet angry ocean below us. I looked around at my family and found that they looked like rag dolls falling to their doom. I then returned my attention to the far off and yet fast approaching ocean below. I felt the sting of the wind as I raced by, but strangely enough I wasn't scared. I was startled for a moment or two, but it faded away into a blank, numb feeling. I remember thinking Our car insurance is gonna go through the roof, but I had that sarcastic, sad feeling when I said it. Like I was trying to bring some humor to the situation. Then I closed my eyes then opened them to find that I had woken. I may have been slightly unfeeling  in the dream, but I felt like I was almost going to cry for a moment. Thankfully, I didn't. I don't understand this dream. I admit I'm a little scared of it though. I'll put all thoughts about this aside for later."

"event","Well, today was interesting. We now have two exchange students at Ramsay. I only met one, and  boy, did he seem really smart. His name is Jakob (pronounced Yakob) and I was charged with taking him to two of his classes. If he still needs anything he can ask me, but he probably already remembers where everything is. He has a nice accent though.
He is able to play the Cello and the piano ( I don't know about anything else) and he took to debate quite well. He figured out something no one else could. Mou, somebody from a foreign country came and beat us in his first day. We suck bad. lol Oh well!^_^ 
The most amusing part was that all these girls came up to him at different intervals and basically flirted with him. I felt like saying ""Run faster, the fangirls are closing in!"" One girl told him to tell her she was beautiful in German. My seat is next to his (she went over to him) so I heard everything. I had to bite the inside of my mouth (so hard that I punctured it, and let me tell you, it hurts!), just so I wouldn't burst out laughing. It didn't work, but everyone else, including the teacher, were laughing as well, so it didn't matter.

The library finally opened back up in our school today. I was so happy that when I entered Tiffany said "" Noel, what have I told you about crack."" or something to that effect. The rest of my day was pretty boring, so I'll stop here. ^_^ 

Bye! ^_~"

"event","I am now a member of Livejournal after having Kantama pester me for almost a year to make an account and yet for some reason I make it at 4:27 in the morning. Why? The only reason I can think of is I'm dumb this way. Right now I am sitting in my room with Xenosaga playing in my PS2 and Ziggy has been saying the same sentence for hours. 

I just got my hair done yesterday at 9:38 in the morning. I also should mention that I didn't get to sleep until 4:38 yesterday morning. I have not slept a wink since then. Lack of sleep, the pure hatred of being forced to get my hair done, and the mixture of too many hair care products in the air did not improve my morning in the least. At the moment I'm so tired I feel dead on my feet, but I wanted to get this out of the way. At least I don't have to do anything tomorrow so I can sleep in. 

Now I need to give a warning. If you want to read about an exciting life don't read this journal. At points it will be depressing, but there is also a severe lack of action or for that matter anything interesting, so I highly suggest you look elsewhere. Thats about it for now. Since it is now 5:20 I am going to get some sleep (finally). ^_^

Good night all."

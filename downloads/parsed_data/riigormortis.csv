There were people standing on the floor but then they filtered out and only sophomores remained and started dancing like old couples before totally laying down next to eachother and not moving. For a moment I got caught up in the oldpeople dancing and somehow was able to dance with myself and was holding a mysterious back and hand but nothing else. We pointed out Sommer laying among the sophomores in a white hoodie with neon colors. Then I went home, but home was this giant house with a store that doubled as a garage attached and it was who else but the Camdens house. I still don't know how the church could afford to give them their huge house and make an addition on it. They weren't there anyway. Roseanne and I ended up playing hide and seek after we were playing around on some sort of street sweeping contraption. Then someone came in the shop and there was a strange woman at the register and i was stuck in some aisle by lindt truffles because it was two feet wide and I dropped a white chocolate one on the floor but couldn't reach it. Then when I was walking inside I was hiding from my sister, not Roseanne anymore. I tried hiding in her room and then hid in the tub in our bathroom until she came to the stairs and said something that apparently ended the game.

I see that mostly everyone had a good Christmas, and to the ones who did not... I feel your pain.
Christmas isn't special anymore.&nbsp; Sure, being with family is nice and giving to loved ones is great, but the warm tingling feeling inside is gone and has no promise of returning.

What I got for xmas...

* Nikon D50 camera
* Tripod
* $125
* movie money
* Bluenotes gift card
* Betty Boop singing xmas ornament
* Pat Benetar, Blondie, Cyndi Lauper, and Joan Jett records from Jeremy.
* my grammy's vintage jewelery she left me
* ear rings and a necklace
*&nbsp;leopard print scarf and mittens
* Blondie shirt
* a shitload of candy and chocolates
* leopard print hair clips
* professional makeup kit
* coloring stuff with markers
* satin&nbsp; pj's
* bath stuff
*&nbsp;Betty Boop magic balloon
* camera case
* gym membership and weights
* picture frames
* mermaid soap
* makeup bags
* pewter jewelery case with 'Grandaughter' ingraved on it

breakin my heart into a million pieces
like you always do.

And you don't mean to be cruel
you never even knew about the heartache
I've been going through.

Well I try and try to forget you girl 
but it's just so hard to do
everytime you do that thing you do.

I know all the games you play
and Im gonna find a way to let 
you know that you'll be mine someday.

Cause we could be happy can't you see
if you'd only let me be the one to hold you
keep you here with me.

Cause I try and try to forget you girl
but it's just so hard to do
everytime you do that thing you do.

I don't ask a lot girl
but I know one things for sure
it's the love I haven't got girl
and I just cant take it anymore...woooooww!

Cause we could be happy can't you see
if you'd only let me be the one to hold you
keep you here with me.


Cause it hurts me so just to see
you go around with someone new
and I know you your doing that thing
everyday your doing that thing
I cant take you
doing that thing you do."

"event","hey its 7:55am and Im staying home at least for the morning because last night the internet was slow and didnt work on our computer so I couldnt do my science assignment because I had like no information. When I asked mom to read it to make sure it was good, she told me ""you will get about a 2% on this!"" and looked mad at me because I left the project until like 9pm to start it because I had it done except for the typing it up part, and I didnt have enough information so...Anyways me and mom got in a huge fight which ended up me storming back up to my room (crying) and her just shaking her head because she knew I could do better. I never cried for a long time before last night,but I guess its good to know that I still know how.Mom wont let me on msn tonight because she got mad at me for being on it while I was typing up my project. I was talking to Spencer on the phone when I was typing it too, and while mom was reading it. When I was turning off the printer and getting ready to go to bed and say goodbye to Spencer mom told me that my paper was shit pretty much. I said goodbye to Spencer and went upstairs and ...yeah. So here I am staying home for the morning, and If I can pull it off..the afternoon too! But yeah I guess all this week Im going to study because I have a math test on Wednesday and an Ancient History test on the same day and an Ancient History assignment due Wednesday also. High School is hard for me this year because I have hard subjects this semester...math,science,ancient history, and art(which is easy but time consuming). All I want to do is make my mom and dad proud of me like they were last year when I graduated with honours. Im goin to try my best this week(and semester) to study almost every night and get better grades than the 70's that Im getting now from studying only one night a week. 
       This weekend was fun and last night me,Liz,Jordan,and Jordans family all went out to supper at Mike's which was awesome! I always have a great time when Im with Jordan, since we only have eachother eh Jorr? haha Next weekend is going to AMAAAZING! because me Jordan Liz and Kathleen are all going to the Halloween dance at St.Pyus Church Hall. That weekend Im staying at Jordans because my family is going to Cape Breton for a wedding and wont be back until Sunday afternoon for the Halloween trick-or-treaters. Spencer is hooking me up with his friend Evan, so I guess Im meeting him this weekend sometime...lol. Natalie wants me to do something with her next weekend but I cant because I'll be at Jordans and Nat lives in the boonies so that makes it even harder for us to get together. 
        Anyways Im gonna go and do some research on my Technology Assignment thingy now so I can proove to my family Im not an idiot..lol.

         Jordan-call me 
         Spencer-call me
                           (since Im not allowed on msn) lol"

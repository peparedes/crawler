You are the rebel with a relentlessly restless nature. Smart but when unleashed, you tend to seek out exotic experiences over new ideas. People are sometimes flustered by your great potential, but you love your unconventional life. You're a heartbreaker, though not always knowingly. People get attached to you, and then you move on."

"event","kevin always gives me a lot of shit about me watching oprah. but hey I learn great things from there and it entertains me. 

but the episode yesterday that I was able to watch today was about celebrity power couples and had Seal and Heidi Klum (whom I love) on it. And Seal said that he always looks at his wife as his best friend first because you don't take your BF for granted and that you will always want to impress them and be good to them (where you might not do that for your spouse). I agree with him. He also said that people need to keep their relationships first and then their children (family) and then their career. I thought that was wise and just great. I wish that people would adhere to this kind of advice. 

I am going to think about these and keep them close to my heart."

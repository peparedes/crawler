"event","this summer is going to by so fast. i went to the beach last week and the week went by soo fast and i didnt want to come home. i had soo much fun. we were at holden so it was really quiet compared to myrtle. a lot of really random things happened. like one morning we went outside and there was a huge crab in our pool. the craziest thing was when brooke and i were walking, a deer just ran out of nowhere and like took off into the ocean and drownd. it was soo weird and sad =(.  we were like traumatized after that lol.

last night kim, emily, and i went to see dark water at the new theater in cross lanes. i took kim and we def. got lost and emily had to come find us haha i swear i am the WORST with directions. and we were def. the only three people in our movie so we like screamed soo loud at all of the scary parts and after the movie when we came out the people that worked there were laughing at us. afterwards, kim and i went to mcdonalds and talked to some baseball players from virginia haha.

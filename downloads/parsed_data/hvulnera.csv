<lj-cut>
It was so it was not in a time long forgot
     Well, anyway goes something like this
     I can't be sure because when  they came to call I wasn't myself no yaar
not my  self at all some days are hard how to tell you what sickness is like
something like this but I can't be sure
     Always one part of me  is standing outside screaming no please don't no
but it does no good you see when the sickness comes
     I am  the angel the  god damned  angel of  god  and these days it's the
avenging angel Gibreel the avenger always vengeance why
     I can't be sure something like this for the crime of being human
     especially female but not exclusively people must pay
     Something like that
     So he brought her along he meant no harm I know that now he just wanted
us  to be together caca can't you see he said she isn't ohoh over you not by
a  longshot and  you he said  still crazy fofor her  everyone knows  all  he
wanted was for us to be to be to be
     But I heard verses
     You get me Spoono
     V e r s e s
     Rosy apple lemon tart Sis boom bah
     I like coffee I like tea
     Violets are blue roses are red remember me when I am
     dead dead dead
     That type of thing
     Couldn't get them  out of my nut and she  changed in front of my eyes I
called her names whore like that and him I knew about him
     Sisodia lecher from somewhere I knew what they were up to
     laughing at me in my own home something like that
     I like butter I like toast
     Verses Spoono who do you think makes such damn things up
     So I called down the wrath of God I pointed my finger I shot him in the
heart but she bitch I thought bitch cool as ice
     stood and waited just  waited and then I don't know I can't be sure  we
weren't alone
     Something like this
     Rekha was there floating on her carpet you remember her Spoono
     you remember  Rekha on her carpet  when we  fell and  someone else  mad
looking guy Scottish get-up <i>gora</i> type
     didn't catch the name
     She saw  them  or she didn't  see them I  can't be sure she  just stood
there
     It was  Rekha's  idea take her upstairs  summit of  Everest once you've
been there the only way is down
     I pointed my finger at her we went up
     I didn't push her
     Rekha pushed her
     I wouldn't have pushed her
     Spoono
     Understand me Spoono
     Bloody hell
     I loved that girl.

Maybe we're all just one big moment
one big maw of raw potential and endless probabilities
piercing the eyelids and heading straight towards the cerebral cortex
in hopes of finding something down there in the dark dank basement of the psyche.
Yeah...that must be it
something, somewhere --I can feel it in my quarks.
Its that shudder/goose bump thing you do when the toes curl up 
and I hear you howl at the moon like a dog.
And maybe this time, time isn't the answer
for we both know that time never resolved any disassociate train of thought
and time never made anything better
especially not for us.
From mechanics to fractals, from icecream to god
where the blind passion can both kill and concieve in a single brush stroke of the young artists hands.
Emerging, submerging, illusively still
just one moment where I can love you, undress you, hold you, make you mine
just one second where we can transcend this skin and become one with the skies
just one moment where we can be for now, and then, and ever still
just one second please. </b></center>"

I went to Falconer with them and they weren't so bad but every time our instructer Marty Baum Swears, is sarcastic, or feciosous they laugh their asses off.  It wouldn't be so bad if they weren't the only ones laughing but they are so its very irritating.  Other than that it seems like its going to be a koolio class despite it being 3.5 hours long.

Jessy and his store(Second Skin) Were on the news!  Chanel 7 was doing a report on the sex industry and how it sells *cheers for Jessy and second skin*

Last night Laurel and I went to Chatauaqua Institution for the coffee house event.  Doug and Vanessa were there but I don't think they remembered Who I am.  I read my poem <b> The Problem with Newtonian Physics</b> and everybody liked it a lot but those people never say hello to me even though I am usually the only person who I go with that reads anything.  They always say hello to Laurel or Rachel, hmmm.....


Dan is coming home on Memorial Day weekend for two weeks! I can't wait to see him, he's going to being staying at Mark's while he's here and Mark is talking to me and stuff again and that's always good too.

"event","Yesterday after school, went to the showcase of the bands. Four bands played: Failing Friday, Waiting till Daybreak, Watson, and Jimithy's Id.

Failing Friday: Christian pop punk and not that bad.   Jamin did a really good job last night despite that he sounds like a homosexual squirel

Waiting Till Daybreak:  Metal and sucky.  The vocalist's voice kept cracking and the mics were fucked up...They covered Outkast.

Watson:  HxC Punk and it was okay.  Not my favorite, kinda annoying but alright all in all.

Jimithy's Id: ? and loving it.  Kinda metalish, I know all the member's of the band and I didn't know Mike had such a death scream in him.  Excellete kids.


I saw many people that I knew from all over including: Rob the illusive figure-skater boy, Gina in all her cellulite accussing me of giving her dirty looks, Nicole Olvey the <b> lying</b>lesbian I've never met, Kevin the emotion Korean who I went to first grade with, and many others....

It was pretty koolio although I thought one of them was high because she tried about 15 times to say ""Robert H Jackson"" but ended up putting the name John in it and finally gave up attemping  to say it.

  Ate lunch with Margot, Courtney, Alex, Shakeema,& Priscilla and we all ended up talking to this angry adolescent boy named Jim from Clymer.  Nice fellow though.  Bus ride home I slept, my hag never showed up but it's all good, gotta get back to class...

"event","Normalacy is and has never been any issue of consequence.  Any person with minimal perceptional skills can comprehend that a sense of normalacy is subjective cognitive functioning in societies that embodies the ones sense of stability NOT actual external conditions of what is.  Now granted we never have spoken in person but that does not change the fact that I do not like you. Your political agendas against your fellow man aswell as your own bias against me led me to this conclusion. Objectivity cannot exist in this world, any great writer should know this. One can only describe their perceptions of reality, not actual reality.  Read up on Immanuel Kant and the <i> Das Ding an Sich</i> idea, you'll find him quite informative in your quest for profound insight.  While one may argue that what is written by their hand does not capture the essence of their selfhood (which I would argree with full-heartedly) you must understand that one is written does in some manner convey a part of you. For example:  I cannot say that the poetry I write fully captures the essence of what I am because I believe that I am an infinitively complex organism, incapable of being confined to paper, ink, and obscure mental references.  I cannot say however, that what I have written did not come from me and is not linked to my being in some way.  What makes what I write unique is that I wrote it and no one has a perspective on the universe like I do.  My physical form as well as my socialization is unique to mankind and the history of mankind and there has to be a bit of someone in what they create or it wouldn't be theirs....

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm glad you've gone back to sports because you suck at life... :)"

a song to motivate the inner ear today

<b>VNV Nation - Legion</b>

Enveloped in a sentiment,
a sound that rushes over me.
Engage an impulse to pretend
I have a faith as pure.
Not forgetting what it means to dream.
Indulging everything.
Entertaining thoughts that I've the strength
of those I yearn to be.
Cheers and tribute greet the saviours.
Reckless thoughts survive.
Anachronistic and impulsive.

And what will happen?
Will I dream?
I am too scared to close my eyes.
For a second please hold me.
None can change in me these things that I believe.
But I don't know what happens now.
I am too scared to close my eyes."

"event","Have you ever considered that there is no real ""purpose"" in life? Do you honestly think you're parents gave that much thought into having you or maybe you are just the result of one unrestrained night of dispropotional barebacking?  If you still are clinging to the notion of true happiness you're bound to live a miserable existence because nobody is happy all the time because that would make them miserable.  People aren't ment to experience just one emotion all the time, the entire spectrum from happy to sad, from caring to apathatic, even manipulative to niave is inside you every moment, all the time and its you that lets them out.  

Finding yourself is not (and has never been) an issue of ones external conditions. While most of ones personality is formed due to their surroundings, understanding what you are is something that happens within you. Once you know you are you can become at peace with your surroundings regardless of how menacing they may be.

The one thing that I know to be constant is that people leave, (they die, they move, they just stop talking to you, etc). While this may not be liked it <b>is</b> inevitable.  Instead of dwelling on social interactions that are no longer in place why don't you develop new ones? Yes, I know that no two friendships (or even mutanies) are the same but if you dwell on what you lost then you will miss out on so much more by pushing away what could have been. Never forget that this entire world is full of possibilites and none of them you pick is ever wrong.  Also learn to exist independantly from people, learn who you are in relation to yourself at first and then see who you are around others, they are almost always two different people(ie. do you think you could masturbate in front of a group of your friends?)  

By the way, get rid of that <i> I'm fucked up</i> bullshit because <b> nobody</b> thinks its attractive and frankly its goddamn annoying.  Despair is an emotion that only is productive in art, not constant emulation. what you should do is just put love on the back burner right now and just get laid.


so go on out there and get yours!"

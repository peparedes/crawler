"event","basically i don't know what i want.
i know who i am.
i dont know why i'm here or what i'm suppose to do with this life.
i think everything happens for a reason.

""i grew up way to fast and now theres nothing to believe.""

i grew up so much over the years but still have way more of it to do and i'm not in any hurry to be finished.

i've never really felt completly alone before.no matter where i am and even if i know i no one is around for millions of miles i will still not feel alone.lonliness has never been an enemy.emptiness maybe but thats a different story.

i love attention.

i don't think i'm better than everyone but i think i'm the best.
i love myself but i'm not cocky.
i ODed on confidence and havent come down from my trip yet.
i've grew up being completly passive and letting people control my life so recently i've been power hungry.
i'll tell you your wrong and i'm right and we'll do things ""cuz i said so"". 
i won't be walked on anymore.
this is my life and you are only a ""peice of furniture in my room"" or maybe your not even that important to me.
this is my life only.not yours.

i'm headstrong.
i'm completly stubborn sometimes.
big things don't piss me off but little things do.
(not strange at all..)

after you read all that you might not think it's true but i really do have respect for people who deserve it. i try my hardest to see the best in everyone.
certain people mean the world to me and made or will make me part of who i am in my future.
i have no idea whats going to happen to me in the next year coming up.
could be anything at all.
surprise me.
give me your best shot.
=]


i'm me and thats all i can be."

seriously think about that for a second.
if your like ""oh shit"" and stuff the problem grows and you worry and you can stop thinking about it cuz your so busy saying stuff and thinking how bad it is.but if you like just think maybe it's not that bad and maybe my life will go on.life might be harder with the problem but everyone has them and no one knows what to do about them but you don't see pits of dead people in the streets who like ..liked someone who didn't like them back and they died because of it.they eat ben and jerry and move on.thats life.no one wants it to be like that but sometimes problems can't be fixed and you just have to forget.and honestly you can't tell me that ,when your having a ""good day"", you don't forget about your problem.it might come back in your head right before you fall asleep while your laying in your bed thinking about everything and it might hurt but everyone else is doing it too and there gunna be okay in the morning.just think about it.is your problem really that bad.maybe your just making it that way.it's in your head.if you think somethings horrible then your sad and stuff but if your like whatever,its not gunna go away but it will be easier to deal with.


everytime it rains i think of this kind of stuff.and i feel like carrie on sex and the city.lol.

""i was gunna guess brown""
me and melis watched dude where's my car last night.it was so funny.they went to look for their car in this ostrich farm and ashton kept calling them llama's.lol.and then the ostrich farmer caught them and thought they were ostrich poachers or something so he locked them up in a cage next to this crazy guy and the farmer was like ""i'll let you go if you can answer one question right"" and he asked them how fast a ostrich can run and the the whole time they were trying to think of the answer the crazy guy was like ""i know,i know,pass the question to me!""but then the one guy,chester,like watched animal planet and he said the right answer finally and then you just hear the crazy guy,""i was gunna guess brown"".lol.


that wasn't even a funny part but it would take to long to type out one of the funny parts.that whole movie was so funny tho.i love it.

i never know what to write.
ugh.

i always think ""woah,i changed so much"",when i watch those home movies,but i didn't really that much.but then again i did.it's weird.
i dunno.
i kicked my dad on camera...hahahahahaha.


i've been really tired lately but last night i slept for 9 and a half hours and i feel really awake.cool.thats a longgg time for me to sleep.

my moms having a grad. party for me.
i don't even wanna go.lol.
i just hate all the attention on me and everyone asking me about college and stupid shit.
i mean i like my family i guess..but i dunno.
i don't like making a big deal about stuff.especailly school stuff.yuck.
i would just rather celebrate something i'm proud of.
i don't really care that i gradutated,i kinda knew i was going to and if i ever was excited about it,it was for maybe 5 minutes at the ceremony,during the speeches and stuff.
and i don't have any plans and cool stuff to tell people about.
i'm just going to stupid ECC.
who the fuck needs a party for that?lol.
sorry,i just think this partys gunna be lame-o.lol.
but whateverr..the show must go on.

combos are good.
so is mcDonalds.
i guess it is true that if you don't have something for a while it's 10 times better when you finally get it again.
i don't just mean foood,i mean everything.







how does it feel to be different from me?

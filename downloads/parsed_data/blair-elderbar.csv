"event","I don't know what is wrong with me lately. its like, all of the sudden I feel emboldened. I'm even thinking, dare I say it, to actually attend the Ravenclaw quidditch match against Slytherin! I usually lock myself away in the library and jump ahead in my studies, you know, when its actually <i>quiet</i> in there for once. <strike>Those emotional Hufflepuffs are always in there trying to save the trees and giving the mice a chance to escape their traps. Pathetic lot...</strike>

I blame this partially on myself, but mostly I can fall back upon my temperment as a Spaniard. I have been resisting a lot of rumors and looks from many students that I don't even know, and i believe that this definace has been growing inside of me until now... it needs a way out, and I believe that this could be an outlet.

I mean, usually I don't have any desire at all to attend these quidditch matches... especially when it's my own house that is competing... but all of the sudden I think I might go to the next one even when Hufflepuff plays! It's kind of sad... there are so many people here that I don't know even by <i>sight</i> let alone by name. I am convinced that I just need to get out more and meet more new people. I am, I think, an extreme introvert... but by choice. Well, I can change that, or at least I can work on changing that.

I think I'll owl Mama and tell her that I'm going to a large social event by my own choosing instead of jumping ahead a few chapters in Arithmacy... That'll get her grinning, I'll bet.

Great. Who am i going to sit with? Where are my Ravenclaw girls? Where did they go? Excuse me..."

I can't believe it! he actually kissed me! HE kissed ME!... I am about to lose it, here... and I'm meeting his parents tomorrow...

oh, merlin, i shall NEVER get to sleep! I'm trembling and butterflies are having a FIESTA in my stomache... to think that all this time he had these feelings for me... or... what if he's just pretending? No, Blair... stop it. Try and forget your cynical nature for once...

Why am I even in this bed? I'm never going to sleep... but if I start pacing the girls will pry and pry until I have to make something up. What should I wear tomorrow? What if I am late?

HE ASKED ME OUT TO HOGSMEADE!!! AHHHH!!!... okay, Blair.. you're officially going to puke. calm down. breathe. Just because this is the first boy you've ever recieved feelings from ... dosn't mean... anything...

Ahh.... Rigel Black... yo pienso que te quiero...."

"event","I am a complete mess. I know that I have told myself to ignore everything around me, but all the stares and looks and whisperings behind my back are begining to get to me. Just because my family is really poor and my mother is a muggle dosn't mean ANYthing.

I won't blame Rigel if he decides not to pursue our... friendship... maybe I should push him away to save his future life. I don't want him to live with criticism and rumors surrounding him. I already know what that's like, and Merlin knows that I don't wish any of it upon my friends.

I don't even know what to do to Spica to get back at her... I feel so helpless. Wait... something's coming... even if my parents somehow get wind of the rumors that horrible... <i>thing</i> is spreading  one can always find out that I'm still a virgin, right? there are tests for that, right? there's gotta be.

hah. I'm feeling better already... but I still firmly believe that words can hurt more than the cruelest of tortures. I am worn thin... tired... depressed. and all because of a boy. I wonder if this is even worth it..."

<i>Was it all a dream? did I really dance every dance with him?.... did... did her really say all those nice things to me?... Merlin, I CAN'T go out there now! what will everyone say? They'll never let me live this down! ... but I don't want to totally blow him off, because there's a side to Rigel that I don't completely understand that showed itself to me...</i>

*turns over*

<i>Ooooh... and Valentine's day is tomorrow.... what'll happen? should i do something for him?</i>

*sits up quickly and shakes head*

<i>Stop it, Blair... Stop it. You're freaking out over a MAN. You've never done this before, and you don't intend to start now. You're independant. You'll just go about your days normally as if this never happened. You will ignore Spica, you will deny all that the girls say... and... you'll HOPE to not die if you see Rigel in the halls.</i>

*blinks*

<i>I'm not very good at motivating myself...</i>

*smiles as she lies back down and relives the last dance of the night... Rigel holding her close and telling her random things... all she could remember was the sound of his deep voice resonating in his chest where she rested her head....*"

"event","I wasted no time after sending off Remus' Owl and shoved the books I'd been using in the library back on the shelf, hurrying out and up the stairs.

I felt awful for forgetting tha it had been the full moon.  Normally I remembered and could at the very least be there when he got back.

But I'd been such an utter prat lately that I'd forgotten entirely.
Stupid of me..

I managed to slip through to the dorms un-noticed by anyone else and found Remus looking rather sickly.

""Heya mate...""  I said quietly, sitting down beside his feet on the bed.  ""Can I get anything for you?"""

Remus,

Are we okay?  I haven't talked to you in days.
I haven't been avoiding you, but I don't know if you've been avoiding me.

Can we meet?  Talk, at least?  Even if it's through Owls?

Remus,

You know that thing you mentioned last year?

Well...I know there was many things, but that one THING in particular?

I don't want to mention it in the owl in case someone gets hold of it, even though I warded it.

You don' have a clue what I'm talking about, do you?

We need to meet then. Soon.

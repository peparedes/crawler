I hate my annoying passive aggressive little shit coworkers and they disgust me.&nbsp; I hate how they talk about my professor behind her back.&nbsp; I think it's abhorrently rude when they roll their eyes or say their little stupid sarcastic side comments.&nbsp; I hate it when they try to commandeer work and try to edge me out of the process.&nbsp; 

But the thing that I hate most of all is that I let them get to me and let them give my professor a reason to overlook all of that.&nbsp; I'm so disappointed that I disappointed an employer, inspiration and really good friend because of two people who are completely and utterly below me.&nbsp; I am so completely ashamed that I did not realize this sooner and allowed it to affect my cohesion with the research team as a whole and my ability to work with people despite how much I dislike them.&nbsp; And I'm saddened by the fact that no matter how many times I learn these lessons, they, for one reason or another, cannot seem to stick.&nbsp; 


I skipped Aikido today.&nbsp; What a horribly stupid stupid idea."

"event","When someone seems really pissed off, or even if something just seems a bit off, lots of the time that person REALLY wants someone to acknowledge it.&nbsp; Even if it ends up being something they can/have to work out on their own, avoiding a friend when they are in a serious crisis because you don't want to make it worse, or don't know how to deal with it, is the worst thing you could ever do.&nbsp; A simple ""dude, I've been noticing that you're not yourself lately, is something up?"" would probably do a world of good.&nbsp; Too often, people ignore a situation like this, and it ends up being the isolation that really beats a person down.&nbsp; The human psyche can withstand almost any pressure when it has the support of intimate relationships, whereas I am convinced that it cannot stand at all without them.&nbsp; You may think you are helping when you take to the back seat and let your troubled friend coast through their hard times, but you are doing them, and yourself, a horrible disservice.&nbsp; Chances are, they are wondering why you haven't asked them about it.&nbsp; 

So stop being meek, and don't stop yourself when you have the impulse to ask someone if something is wrong.&nbsp; Chances are your intuition is correct and your friend will thank you when their recovery from their bad day/week/depressive episode finally swings around.&nbsp; You'll understand why when you end up feeling the same way at some point in your life."

"event","I've kind of sworn off blogging recently, partially because I've been too busy, but partially because it is gradually dawning on me that teenage (or young adult) blogging is so often a way to avoid living life by ""writing about life"".

However, I forgot to reflect on the prior year, so I guess I'll do it now.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone always says that they've grown a lot in any given year, but I think I really did this year.&nbsp; I think I've experienced some of the best that humanity can offer, and most definitely some of the worst.&nbsp; I've had my heart broken twice, once by my own doing.&nbsp; And of course, I took a trip of many miles and am in the process of seeing who I miss, who misses me and what that means.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year saw the tail end of a trifecta of dealing with mortality: loss of a friend, loss of a family member, public loss.&nbsp; Lily was still very much fresh in my mind during the earlier months, and Sunny and James came very soon after.&nbsp; These experiences haven't just been about my own acknowledgment of mortality, they have also been portals of insight into the depth of human complexity.

I came into writing this feeling like I had so much to say.&nbsp; Maybe I really wanted someone to say something to.&nbsp; Who knows."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like I've begun to outgrow blogging in the recent month or so.&nbsp; Or maybe it's because I'm too busy doing stuff to actually write about it.&nbsp; It isn't as if I have not been experiencing things that I tend to blog about.&nbsp; It may just be that I'm getting better at dealing with them instead of throwing them to the hungry, anonymous (and not so anonymous) eyes of the internet.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe it's because I'm losing the ability to express what I'm thinking about through something like a blog.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A random observation that sparked this post to begin with:

I was on facebook, bored and procrastinating, of course, and I start coming across the names of people I definitely don't talk to anymore.&nbsp; It isn't even that we don't talk.&nbsp; It's that we don't talk, and the chances of us conversing ever again are slim to none.&nbsp; Then again, I'll probably be proven wrong when I head back to the States and we have conversations as if we were still in high school.&nbsp; But we're not in high school.&nbsp; We're different people now.

The voice of a friend of mine is still ringing through my head.&nbsp; Why do I have to keep pretending to be friends with these people?&nbsp; I want to stop pretending.&nbsp; I want to stop being a needy, brainless sheep of a human being that doesn't know when it's time to let go of the relationships that have become more of an obligation than something to maintain.&nbsp; 



It's time to take a renewed no bullshit pledge.&nbsp; If the connections I form with people are weak and meaningless, how can I expect anyone to value my friendship in the first place?&nbsp;"

What really pisses me off is that this person insists that nothing is wrong, but makes it SO transparent that they don't like me, it's almost above and beyond straight up telling me exactly what is wrong with me.&nbsp; I mean, if you are going to make the effort to be THAT obvious about it, why don't you just tell me so I can fix whatever pisses you off so much?&nbsp; Wouldn't that just make things easier for you and me?&nbsp; I wouldn't have the play the guessing game regarding what you hate about me, and you might not have to deal with what you hate about me if I fix it.&nbsp; Of course I can't fix it if I don't know what it is.

But of course not, that would be too simple.&nbsp; 

If you are a friend of mine, don't you dare do this, or I swear I'll just cut you out of my life forever.&nbsp; I can do it now too; I'm in Japan.&nbsp; I don't have to see your ass for a very long time if I don't want to."

"event","As I started to pack I've started to realize how much growth this summer has represented for me.&nbsp; I've taken in a lot over the last 9 weeks, and not all of it has been Japanese.

Lessons learned, stuff to remember:

-It is possible to explain ridiculous summer camp esque games to people who can in no way communicate with you at all.
-Trying to explain abstract ideas in Japanese without using English is not only hard, it builds character.
-Sometimes, you really ARE reading too much into things and you really ARE taking things too seriously.
-Ping pong is the ultimate escape from all things studying.
-Class at 8 every morning can be enjoyable.
-Japanese people do not cease being fun when they hit middle age.
-Summer in Vermont is atrociously hot.
-Exercise can cure almost any emotional ail.
-You can establish incredible friendships based on very little verbal communication.
-People are not always considerate, but that is because they are people and fundamentally imperfect.
-Muscle mass leaves twice as quickly as it is gained.
-Scary movies can become hilarious with a well placed laugh.&nbsp; Or 100.
-The definition of contentment is lying in a circle with friends looking up at the stars.
-Japanese people really do love pictures, but only because the only thing they love more is what was going on when they were taken.
-The 21 year old drinking age is completely arbitrary.
-Language barriers can be powerful blocks to human interaction.
-Learning something with the fascination of a child is the best way to approach it.
-Sometimes sentimentality can be cleansing.
-The hurt you feel when you leave people behind means that they were the kind of people worth meeting.

At approximately 9PM tonight, I will be officially allowed to speak English again.&nbsp; I'm not sure I want to."

Ten things to ten people I'd probably never say, but feel completely comfortable saying through the semi anonymity afforded by the internet!

1) I fought battles with my parents and drove farther than I ever have, and I think I did it because of you.&nbsp; I shouldn't have thought that it would have been any different.&nbsp; I was, of course, acting like an idiot that Saturday night.&nbsp; You were right, but that doesn't make it hurt any less.&nbsp; I'll miss you.

2) I'm glad you finally managed, under the enormous pressure I put forth, to let go of me a little bit.&nbsp; Worrying about me like that is a sign of love, but if you don't let go slowly, you will be forced to let go all at once, which will be so much more painful, I assure you.&nbsp; I'm not an adult yet.&nbsp; I'm not pompous enough to think that of myself.&nbsp; But, the development of real autonomy requires concessions on the controlling powers that be.&nbsp; Thanks.

3) You almost killed my confidence in this group.&nbsp; I'm not going to take it sitting down.&nbsp; I know I can sing just as well as you can, and I'll do it the way I want, and on my terms.&nbsp; Someone who I respect far more than you called you the biggest error he's ever made in terms of induction into this group, and it isn't because you aren't talented.&nbsp; I want to be buddies, but if you don't cut this competitive jock shit out of your personality, that's going to be really hard.

4) Stop being a creepy stalker girl.&nbsp; If you want to have anything resembling normal interaction with me again, you need to give me some space.&nbsp; Lots of space.&nbsp; I'm so glad I'm an ocean away next year.&nbsp; 

5) I hate this stupid a cappella rivalry shit.&nbsp; You may not have noticed it, but it has been the only point of contention in our friendship.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to fix it, but it's only going to be worse when we are leading our respective groups.&nbsp; I never thought that the one thing we both love to do is making things really awkward.

6) Why can't you get it together?&nbsp; I know it's that time of the year, but come on.&nbsp; I'm not trying to impose myself on you guys, but I made a HUGE investment of my time and soul into this, and it hurts me when I come back to see a complete lack of commitment.&nbsp; You have a beautiful thing, but everything takes maintainence and INVESTMENT OF THE SELF.&nbsp; I want to start coming back because I'm proud that I can sit in and just listen.&nbsp; Right now, I'm coming back because I feel like I need to.&nbsp; I'm not trying to relive my glory days, I'm not trying to take over.&nbsp; I'm just gravely worried.&nbsp; That's why I'm coming back so often.&nbsp; I can't do that next year, so please, for pity's sake, get your shit in order.

7) You are so confusing... Make your intentions clear please.

8) Holy crap, I was so frickin' intimidated by you when I first met you.&nbsp; It turns out that you are a pretty sweet dude after all.&nbsp; It's a shame we didn't meet earlier.&nbsp; You may smoke too much, drink too much, and have way too much fun, but somehow you managed to get it all done.&nbsp; The same cannot be said for a lot of people.&nbsp; Congrats on becoming a real person, NYC is lucky to have you.

9) Really?&nbsp; Really... Him?&nbsp; You can do better.&nbsp; Do better.

10) I don't know if I'm sorry that this happened or if I'm mad you got off the hook.&nbsp; I guess we'll never know.&nbsp; Just know that I'm not afraid of you, nor will I ever be.&nbsp; Leave the bravado for your stupid football buddies who respect that kind of thing."

"event","<br /><div text=""Written by my cousin Jennifer Tan..."" class=""ljcut"">Written by my cousin, Jennifer Tan:<br /><br />""My brother's name is Tuan Tan, but for as long as I have been speaking, we have called him Sunny. He was born in Vietnam, my mother's first child. My aunts who remain in the country--and who have not seen him since my mother brought him over to America when he was three years old--remember him as an illuminating, delightful little baby who sassed everybody in perfect Cantonese and Vietnamese. He was beautiful. And for those three years, it was just he and my mom.<br /> <br /> He is 29 years old and has been my brother for just a little over 22 of them. Despite this length of time, I've only recently begun to know him, when he finally moved home after rebelling in high school, struggling through two years in college, and moving to New York City with the love of his life. In my memories of him from when I was younger he is shrouded in darkness, a part of this older, cooler universe of which I could only dream of being a part. I remember the attic room, which he shared with Jimmy. He snuck in girls and cigarettes and our first dog, Asia, without my parents knowing. I stole his Miss Saigon, Les Miserable, Wu-Tang cds to record onto casette, because I only had a walkman. Later, he bought me my first cd player and then my first cd, Tragic Kingdom, which he subsequently stole back to give to a girl he liked. He had books and books of drawings, graffitti, and poems, which I would snoop through his things to read. I discovered that he had his heart broken by his first girlfriend in high school. I remember that all of his girlfriends were the prettiest girls I'd ever seen.<br /> <br /> He doesn't think that he's ever recovered from that first broken heart. He regrets all of his fuck ups from when he was younger, just like Dad said that he would. He smokes and has a thick Boston accent and drinks too much. He is too creative and brilliant and undisciplined for his own good. He is arguably the most charming, attractive, and intelligent person in our entire three families, and we have always loved him, despite ourselves. I have always been proud to have him as my brother. And he loved us. But the fundamental truth is that he was very, very unhappy. He was tired of failure. He was afraid of being alone. He was afraid of growing old. But he was not afraid of death.<br /> <br /> We had all had an awesome ten days, since Jimmy came back. Two weekends ago they came down to Brown for a pig roast with my friends. Last weekend I went home with CJ and Ellen for the Asian New Year. When we were together for the New Year, Sunny pulled me aside and told me, ""I hadn't realized how much I missed Jimmy."" All of us cousins got together both nights at our house, so I know that in these last few moments, he was happy and surrounded by love. He stayed in from work and drove CJ and I back to school on Monday. Wednesday evening Jimmy left for the airport, back to California, and they never got to say goodbye. Afterwards Sunny made a trip to the drug store for some $30 worth of sleeping pills and alcohol. Thursday morning at around 730am he kissed Kiana goodbye and drove 54 minutes straight up I-93 to New Hampshire, where he checked into a tiny motel room. He was happy and loved. He was happy and loved. That is the final irony. He gave us one last incredible moment together, and then, by 2am Friday morning, he was gone.<br /> <br /> I miss him. so much. I am. in pieces. My big beautiful brother. My heart and soul. Oh my god, I miss you so much.""</div><br />So this is how it went...&nbsp; This is what I thought it was when I heard about it earlier.&nbsp; <br /><br />I saw people from this sector of the family for the first time in years.&nbsp; There was something so different about them.&nbsp; Their eyes held an incredible sadness that I had learned to understand this December.&nbsp; I wonder if it's how I still look now.<br /><br />I wish it didn't have to be this way.&nbsp; For Lily.&nbsp; For Sunny.&nbsp; I wish someone could have made them understand."

"event","Holy crap.&nbsp; Best Jambo ever.&nbsp; 

Granted I have only one to compare it to, but it was incredible.

(definately out of order) set list:

Oxygen (D8 Original)
I'd Rather Dance with You (Kings of Convenience)
Washing of the Water (Peter Gabriel)
Secret (Maroon 5)
Running to Stand Still (U2)
All Along the Watchtower (Bob Dylan)
Get Down Tonight (KC and the Sunshine Band)
Black Water (Doobie Bros)
Time is Running Out (Muse)
Super Mario Bros Medley

I don't think I've ever been prouder of being in the D8 or as happy with a show we have done.&nbsp; 


4 brothers are about to become part of the real world.&nbsp; That's a scary thought.&nbsp; If the 20 alums that came back to see us sing are any indication though, they'll be back.&nbsp; 





And they'll bring beer.&nbsp; The D8 always wins."

"event","At some point in my life, I lost all of my self confidence.&nbsp; Either that or I never had it.&nbsp; Or maybe it just disappears when I need it most.&nbsp; 

At Aikido, Holly told me that I had a beautiful voice.&nbsp; I was just fucking around and singing as I was getting to leave.&nbsp; And then of course I went and fucked up two solo auditions.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because whenever I feel the pressure, my chest seizes up, my throat closes and my breathing becomes as shallow as a jock slut that's had a few drinks.

I really don't know why I can't just do shit right.&nbsp; This was my last chance and I fucking blew it."

I have found two things in my life that make me very happy.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure this is the most stable and well grounded I've felt in a long time.&nbsp; I feel really comfortable in my own skin and it feels amazing.&nbsp; Some people never find anything in their life to make them really existentially happy, and I think I've found two?&nbsp;

That being said I'm irritated that my a cappella group seems to be resting on its laurels.&nbsp; Though those laurels are well earned, it'd be nice if we could learn some lessons from the people around us.&nbsp; I want more people to come to our shows and I want more people to be excited and have fun at them.&nbsp; Compromising the integrity of the group is always a concern, of course.

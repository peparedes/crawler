Sometimes I feel like the guy in this relationship...I don't want any attachments but I want the love...lol...I want my cake and eat it too! He wants to date but I want to keep it like the way it is now. </EM></FONT></P>
<P><EM><FONT face=Arial color=#3366ff>Justin M...What could I say about him..He's a total guy and acts like an asshole but somehow I'm attracted to a guy like that. I can't help but want to be with him. My mom brought thsi particular issue up about Justin M. She said he was ashamed of me...ASHAMED? First of all, We're just friends with privlages...Second, I make the plans...Third, I choose to hang out at night and not during the day. So do I give him the chance to be ASHAMED? At first I believed my mom's brain washing talk but then I realized that I choose what we do when we hang out and all I want to do is make out and fondle eachother. Is it worng? NO. I have no attachments. But then again, he's never introduced me to his parents, friends, or anyone else he knows. ODD? Who knows? GUYS=assholes.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face=Arial color=#33cc00>Anyways. Continuing with my job situation. Working at Disney...Almost done with Old Navy...and well I want another job because making 80 dollars every two weeks doesn't even cover the toilet paper I use to blow my nose. lmao.</FONT></EM></P>

<P><lj-cut text=""CONFUSED""><BR>Anyways like I said before...I am in a dilema. I am stuck and I cant move foward or back. *tear* I dont know what to do.<BR>I like one guy but I have faith that it will ever become more than a friendship and then one guy comes bac into my life after four months but I haven't spoken to him enough to make a desicion on this situation. Then I have Roberto telling me what I should do and Emily telling me what to do. And like Emily said ""no matter what anybody tells you, your still going to make your own desicion."" <BR>Its true. <BR>Until I make my desicion....I am stuck. <BR>I cried myself to sleep at night because of this. I have so much fustration. I tried to tell someone but expressing my feelings is harder than I thought. Its hard to open up when you've been hurt. Its hard to believe anything anyone says when promises to you have been broken before. *rolling my eyes*</P>
<P><BR></lj-cut><BR></P>
<P>ANYWAYS. </P>
<P>I dont work until thursday! THANK GOD! My poor feet! </P>
<P>Well I shall be off because its taking me FOREVER and a DAY to update! </P>
<P>GOODBYE,</P>
<P>Allyson</P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#000099 size=7>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!!</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ff9900>Well yesterday was going to be an entry to write about but it but I figured that I would calm down...cuss him out and then write about it...</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#3366ff>Yesterday was of course the day before my birthday and well I had an interview and so my dad, my sis, and I were crusing around waiting for my mom to get out so that we can go eat dinner and well my dad decided to stop at the bank and well GUESS WHO works at the banks...JUSTIN M. (M*TH*R F*CK*R) So yeah I was looking good because I just got out of an interview so I had all the confidence in the world and so he sees me and gives me this ugly look and so I act the bitchiest that I can.....but that didnt work. So yeah he sees me and he has the balls to tell me ""so now your stalking me at work"" and I was like ""MOTHERFUCKER"" but yeah instead I said...""well I'm here with my dad...calm down. So you cant even stop to say hi"" and he stopped and threw out a peace sign...WTF?! Well he was ignoring me for FOUR months...FUCKER. And well I just so happen to run into him and well I thought that this was the situation for me to get over him completly. And the whole ride home I was thinking how I am so over him. So yeah I get home and start to do homework and well I was reassuring myself that I was SO over him. And so I'm doing homework all by my lil self and then in comes a text message from him saying something of the sort that he doesnt want me running into him to be common and I was pissed...MOTHERFUCKER. So yeah I call him so we can talk about the situation like adults but he didnt answer and so I tell him to man up and answer and so I call one more last time and then he finally answers and then I ask him why the hell has he been ignoring me and then he gives me his reasons and I tell him off and give him a piece of my mind and I tell him off so more and he is sitting there on the other side of the phone listening to me yell off his ear and he tells me that he deserves it and if not more...and so he tells me that he really fucked up and he told me that when I text him that he felt really bad and that he knew that he was already too deep to go back and blah, blah and blah...so yeah after I was done cussing him out he was still cracking jokes and well I told myself I am not going to give in to his BS and I am totally over him and fuck that fucker....and so on and so forth so what did Ms. Allyson end up doing....I GAVE IN!!!! Damn me! *rolling my eyes*</FONT></EM></P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>OMG, today I went to go pay for my classes at the campus and well I was waiting for my name to be called and I see this good looking guy and I knew he looked familiar but I couldn't figure out who he was and where I knew him from. Well I kept staring and I figured out who he was. He was this guy from Middle school named Andrew Guy Virgin. Yup thats his name...and man did the years do him good but then I guess he saw me staring at him and he looked at me and I guess he figured out who I was. Ha..</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ffcccc>Anyways.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#009900>I'm talking to Emily....and talking about how boring our lives are....lmao. If only she knew the secret me...lmao. Just kidding. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#33ccff>So yeah yesterday I was cleaning my room and well I was going through all of my disks and I found some personal stuff and I cried so much its not even funny. I wish I had the guts to erase all of that ""crap"" but I kind find it in my heart not to do it. It has so much memory behind I just can't throw it away,or burn it because that would be like throwing away a piece of my memory or burning it. I need to find a solution to put my past behind me and go on with the life that I have now. I hope that this phase will soon pass me but who knows only time can tell and only time can heal old wounds. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#009900>lmao. I know it may sound odd but ""meh.""</FONT></EM></P>

<P><BR><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc>I WAS writing this exciting post but I had to leave to pick up my sister &amp; cousins from camp and I come back and the laptop is COMPLETLY OFF! Ugghghh...*rolling my eyes* so right now I am trying to remeber somewhat of what I wrote so I can RE-type it. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc0000>The first phone call of the day came from Mr. Roberto B. He is so funny. He swears like I'm his doctor, his mechanic, his personal policewoman, and his secretary. He calls me to see if his twitching is normal, he calls to ask me about what kind of shampoo he should buy, he calls me to see if he broke the law or if the other person did. How funny! </FONT><BR></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#3333ff>Second call comes from his brother Alan...*sigh*...he is the biggest dork of my life. I feel so giddyish when my phone rings and its him. Its the same feeling that I had fror Justin M. but for a much better guy...Alan. He is the sweetest thing on earth...*sigh*...its funny, He'll demand things from me and I wont give in and then all of a sudden he'll say please and I'll give it. Thats cute. And he named two of his pets after me...I know that sounds stupid but things like that can capture the heart of&amp;nbsp;a girl. He named one Allyson and the other one victoria. How sweet. I wonder if it means anything? I asked him but he told me no but who knows guys are confusing. Man...he compliments me but it feels wierd...I guess I'm just not good at taking compliments.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><BR><EM><FONT color=#ffcc00>So yeah my days have gone by alot faster than I thought they would have. My lost period is officially over because of certain individuals that have lately lifted my spirits and I thank them. It feels good to be energized and being able to get out of bed and be useful. Now my life is not a waste afterall.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><BR><EM><FONT color=#33ccff>I talked to Colin the other day. Congrats to Colin on his new job. We talked for a good thrity minutes or so.&nbsp;That was&nbsp;fun...</FONT></EM></P>

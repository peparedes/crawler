"event","so i haven't been on here in a while.

too busy living. which is the best excuse.

i've been so sad and worried about rose. i didn't even get a chance to see the baby. everyone at school cared so much the baby had died, but no one cared so much when she had him. 

fuct up.

i've been sad. i wrote rosie a letter. but she hasn't been home to get it. i tried calling her, but she hasn't been home. no one has her boyfriend's number. 

i'm sad because i think rosie is in a bad relationship. an unhealthy one. i always thought it might be, but it smack me in the face today.

i'm sad because my dad is watching baywatch.

i needed a break from eddie and school today. 

i woke up with a migrane and a back ache.

i can't go to the funeral. i would only go to see rosie. but that is reason enough to go. but i don't have a ride. i don't even know where it is. 

eddie wouldn't talk to me last night. he's not a phone person, but sometimes i just need people to tell me things. happy things i usually don't want to hear. happy things that make me angry any other time. and all of a sudden i want to hear then and no one wants to tell me.

i'm so sick of always being the one talking. 

i wish people would talk to me.

oh well i think i've been on eddie's sn too long."

"event","wednesday eddie had a wrestling match. he was winning the whole time, then he tried a bar and he put in a bvad leg and got pinned.

he had to leave for the match on saturday friday night, so i haven't seen him since after school. it wasn't so bad without him, but he didn't wrestle so he must have ben in a bad mood. i'll see him tomorrow.

he came over thursday.  

thursday was peculiar, i came home, and my dad's truck and car were there, but he wasn't. i figured he was outside somewhere but it didn't occur to me he wasn't atound when i was looking for him around 4. i saw blood on his gloves, and i figured he must have had an accident. eddie came over and then my aunt called to let me know he had some broken ribs. 

he got home around 9:30. 

friday i went to get a dress for the dance. 

maria told me i should get ready for the dance at her house with andrea and steph. i really wanted to go to the dance then because it was the first time anyone besides eddie really wanted to anything with me. 

saturday i had practice, it didn't go as smoothly as usual. 

then i went to maria's. and then the dance.

it was boring, until i danced on the table.

stephy fell on her ass.

andrea kissed janos.

maria missed her boy, like i missed mine. 

i'm getting home tomorrow around 10:30 am. i'm calling eddie at 11. i want to see him asap.

i'm watching an odd movie on sci-fi. it's called cool world or something like that.

i'm done. i really don't have anything to talk about."

"event","mike taught me slang for deppresion. slang that i've never heard used before. but slang none the less. 

i realized everyone gets depressed, or at least thinks they are, for whatever reason. 

it's okay too. because different things are important to different people. no one can criticize you for what is important to you.

i noticed some things aren't really important to me, it's just shit i worry about. 

i decided to make two lists, what's important to me, and what i worry about that i should just forget about. it will get in the way of what's important.

IMPORTANT

-school - to get into college i should keep grades up

-eddie - i love him. he keeps me in good disposition

-friends - good friends, their numbers are dwindling. but at least i still have a few to talk to

-the band - the only reason i still write

-snowboarding - the last physical activity

-art class - my creative visual outlet, requires no self motivation.

WORRIES

-what i look like - if someone doesn't like what i look like they are judgemental, and besides, i should want to look good for my own esteem

-that i'm a bum - i have a life. it's necessary to sit at home sometimes

-what people think of me and my actions - if my actions are thought out before hand- and spontaneous actions are not completely done in carelessness, i will be confidant in who i am and what i do

-my future - live for now. take things as they come

-eddie - love is unconditional

i feel so much better.

i need to thank my mom. i vented to her. 

no one helped me figure this out, i talked to no one. i did it on my own. i feel accomplished. 

i thank television. it puts me in a good mood.

i was originally depressed because i hate coming home and having nothing to look forward to all night. i could have gone to a a girls basketball game- i didn't really want to go, so i decided not to. 

myself. i need to start thinking of myself first. it WILL help."

"event","so wednesday andrea didn't come to school. i was sad because i enjoy her company. plus we were going to the wyomissing-brandywine match and switching rides. since she didn't go to school she wasn't allowed to go. 

i convinced my dad to take me.

it was a lot of fun. 

eddie was really sick all day. and at the match he looked like a monster. he was pale and his eyes had dark circles under them and they were glassy. he ached all over. he said he never felt worse in his life.

i made him stay home from school thursday.

kliney had a good match against the wyomissing dude. everyone was chanting his name, screaming. it was chaos when he won.

some upperclassmen brought signs, and a stand up of ""the rock"" with ""brandywine lay the smackdown"" on his shirt. the people there wouldn't let us have our signs and stand up around.

i missed eddie a lot thursday. i dind't have anyone to walk with between classes. and no one to talk to in the classes i have with him.

i'm such a baby.

i visited him after school. we layed around and watched tv. 

no kissing.

tonite we might go to a movie.. or something else. i'm supposed to decide. 

i won't see him tomorrow- i have band practice and then i'm going snowboarding. i was going to go watch eddie wrestle but he said i don't go snowboarding anymore because of him, and that i should go. so i am. i'll be cold though. i always am. 

i came home and my dad was listening to my pink floyd cd. he always does now.

bonding over pink floyd is very comforting.

alaina slapped krissy today. it was cool.

i am amused by others quarrels.

i'm sick or something. 

i told krissy what i thought. it felt good."

i hate how highschool is just a test. 

they see how well you do, and stick you in appropriate colleges. 

and how good of a college you get into is basically what opens doors the fastest for you when you are looking for a job.

i'm feeling very down on the world today.

this is all probably very wrong, but it's what i feel right now.

i'll see eddie later tonite. 

i'll be happier after that.

he didn't get home until 12:30 last night. his finals match was at 11. he was so tired and wanted to go home so bad he said he let the guy pin him.

i still love him.

he came to school today, just because he wanted to see me. he should have slept.

i'm drinking a juice box. 

i'm very hungry- but i decided dinner is during/ after sailor moon.

i thought i had a lot to say but i don't.

"event","i had to sit around for a while.

i was left to my own amusement until about 4:30. 

it makes me feel better when i can pass the time. without getting all worked up. i know the best way to pass time is with eddie, but without him i'm kind of at a loss with how to pass the time.

super nintendo is great.

except when the character dies too many time.

mario 3 for regular nintendo is great. it's exceptionally easy.

it boosts my self esteem.

i know i can one day brag and put on experience on job applications.. ""i defeated mario 3 for the nintendo with ease.""   

or not.

but eddie picked me up. we watched 8mm. i thought it was brilliant. a little vulgar, and violent, but we all need to see that sometime. the fictional version of what happens in the real world. strays most of us away from it.

provokes others.

his parents made this really good dinner. 

he held me until it was time to go.

then i watched ""who wants to be a millionaire"". there was a couple on. the husband seemed smart when he made it on.. but he didn't know who mata hari was. check into that.

tonite eddie has a junior varsity tournament. i won't see him all night. i'm upset. i like getting worked up over not seeing him because i can. no one tells me not to besides myself.

note: my own worst enemy is my own mentality.

so now i'm waiting for my dad to get home to go grocery shopping. then i'll probably go to the wrestling match. how exhilerating.

i'll definately watch sailor moon first."

"event","yesterday was a lot of fun. eddie picked me up around noon. we played mario- watched movies and tv. it was nice just laying around with him. 

being lazy. 

we left to go eat around 6. i made him decide, and i made him let me pay. he picked out taco bell. before we went in, his mom called and said we should come home after we ate. 

no ice skating.

it was okay though, we planned to rent a movie, and we did, but we didn't get to watch it. when we got back to his house, his mom said he should take me home. 

it was only quater after 8, and neither of us wanted me to go home. 

i talked to him later that night.

i love him.

i tried to sleep in today- and i could have.

we were on the phone last night.

my dad woke me up and took me to the airport diner. he asked if i wanted to get dropped off at my mom's. 

i'm sick of being such a bother to them. her and lee make it seem like it's the biggest deal for me and eddie to be at her house. 

""lee thinks that you come over here just to hang out with eddie""

if lee thinks something i wish he would just say it. he wants my mom all for his own, he might as well take her, i never see her anyway. she claims to miss me, but i'm usually the one who makes the effort to see her.

and i would be hanging out with eddie, whether or not i was there. 

it makes eddie feel bad. 

i told him to understand that my mom, lee, and i are always at each other's throats. and it has nothing to do with him.

i hope he knows that.

i love him, i don't want to make him feel guilty. 

the other night, dan told me i was high-strung. he meant that i worry about things more than i should, or let things get to me easier, which i already know.

it's just too hard to fix.

i'm watching 'Glory' with matthew broderick. 

i turned it on in the last half-hour, so i'm mainly trying to figure out whats going on."

i told my dad to pick me up at 6:45. 

i think his hearing is getting worse and worse. 

he never came. by the time i looked at a clock it was nine. 

i was supposed to call eddie around seven. i was going to hang out with him. 

now i'm lonely. 

now my friday night sucked. 

i mean we pumped out three new songs at practice, but i just wanted to be with eddie. that's what i was looking forward to. 

i miss him.

i called at 9:15 and his mom told me he had just left for chris's, and that he would call around 10:30. now i'm trying to kill an hour.

time goes so slow when you're waiting for something.

i miss him. i don't think i mentioned that.

i have a lump in my throat.

i'm listening to depeche mode.

now i want to play everquest because i listened to depeche mode when i played it. it would also be nice because it's a role playing game and i could just try and forget.. stuff.

going up the stairs at school made me breathe heavy.

rosie had to be home bound now. i guess because it's about one month until the baby is born and she should rest. i'm so proud of her. she's really handling her life well, and making the best decisions she can with her decision to keep the baby.

i'm drinking peach icy tea.

i'm thinking of eddie.

i still haven't had a cigarette. it's been since monday. but i had a some chew yesterday. it's expected. 

i have practice with the band tonite. 

i'll probably leave around 6:45. 

i want to see eddie. i miss him. 

we're going ice skating tomorrow. then we're going to dinner. i told him i wanted to treat him to dinner. i have enough money that we can go somewhere nice. but i want him to pick out where we go.

i like when we go and do things together. it's fun. 

my back hurts ;( 

i'm happy.

today at lunch i got a milk, ice cream, and mini oreos. 

i mixed it all together. 

eddie told me that's what he makes at lunch. i missed him so i made it. 

i was hungry so i got pizza too. 

whenever i miss eddie in school i usually get peach tea, that's his favorite drink, and probably mine too.

i'm watching sailor moon. i missed it friday. i'm quite upset by that. i wonder if it was the last of the important episodes.

if you don't watch sailor moon you wouldn't understand. the easiest way to explain this is by saying, it's like a soap opera. but not quite.

eddie and i have been going out 3 months.

he had wrestling today, and then we have choraliers, but afterwards, around 7:30, we should have some time together.

he wanted to make me a feast.

he told me to me hungry.

now i just thought of that song ""hungry eyes"" in dirty dancing. i love that movie.

last night eddie told me he usually sleeps without a shirt on. sometimes just in boxers. i was turned on. i was jealous of his sheets, his bed. i just wish i could sleep next to him. i could stay for always. 

it all reminded me of how i like to sleep naked. but it's far too cold out. it's too cold to just change from my clothes to my pj's. i'm more prone to masterbating if i sleep naked. i feel so sexy. it's my thing.
i love his body. mmmmmm :)~  i love him. he's the most wonderful guy for me.

what you feel is what I feel for you
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you, 
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you

Take your time, if I'm lying to you, 
I know you'll find that you believe me, you believe me
Feel the sun on your face and tell me what you're thinking
Catch the snow on your tongue and show me how it tastes
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you, I'll always be alone, 
if I'm lying to you
Take your time and if I'm lying to you, 
I know you'll find that you believe me, you believe me""

i think it's beautiful. i think i am not. in certain ways. i can't be who i want. i can't do what i want. life isn't what i want. it's not what i make of it. 

am i controlling? 

i think i smother. i never shut up. i always talk. i'm not..."

"event","i feel and it hurts right now.

i'm obsessive and i want it to leave right now.

i don't want to eat. 

i want to throw up.

i want to talk to someone objective. 

someone far away from me. far away from my life and who i am. far from knowing anything about me. 

i want to be told i'm loved. 

i feel like he could do without me.

he says he couldn't.

i feel all these things because i'm obsessive.

i feel like i have no life because he does.

i always talk about myself. other people have bigger problems. now i'm being obsessive about this.

i hate having things wrong with me. things that i can see. things no one else even thinks or cares about.

i want to punch the wall and break my hand. 

don't ask why i think, feel, or want to do any of this.

i changed my mind. 

i don't want to talk to anyone.

i want to sleep but my eyes don't.

i want to get fuct up.

i never want to do anything with my life.

i want to work till my hands bleed and accomplish nothing. i only want to undo what has been done.

i need something. i'm going to cry. for no reason.

someone thinks they did something wrong. this is my fault. i did it all. 

i don't think about suicide. 

i wonder if i have a good stomach, to be able to deal with corpses. i want to be a coroner, or a forensic pathologist. i'm so morbid. 

i'm so dramatic. 

i don't care, no one reads these. 

i care.

i don't know pain. i want to break my arm. shatter the pieces of bone. 

i'm sick. mentally. 

there's something wrong with me.

i changed my mind. 

i want to talk to erik. 

he knows a lot. more than me.

this isn't your fault. stop blaming yourself. don't read the rest. 

this is MY fault. 

i want things going on in my head. 

beautiful things that will make people cry it makes them so happy. 

my beautiful things are material. my beautiful things don't exsist. does beauty always make people happy? 

someone is out there.

erik came online. 

i haven't talked to him in a while. i'm not talking about this. i don't want to talk about this. but someone should ask. not what's wrong or anything like that. what they can do to make me feel consoled.

why must i see what i hate most? 

why does he do it? i could have died. 

FUCK.

ARGH.
SHUT UP.

I HATE THIS.

I HATE YOU. 

hate, no. i don't hate. i hurt. i mistake it for anger and hate. i'm not sorry."

"event","that last entry was cool as shit.

i'm not regretting that at all. 

i'm still not touching myself.

val i know what you mean about masterbating. the whole thing about touching yoursef sexual doesn't work because it doesn't know what's going on.

porn is awesome. that helps me. 

i like talking about sex. 

sex. 

it's definately a word i like to use.

tongue fuck. 

are we allowed to curse in here?

the lines on this journal webpage are really cheesy. too lame. i think the only thing that could be worse would be smiley faces. they were really trendy in sixth grade. and that 'whatever' shirt vanessa always wore.

man it smells like SHIT. i hate the whole catbox in the basement. the computer is in the basement. this really took me out of my horny mood. 

brb.

man that lysol better make that go away.

yeah. i'm getting my orange- pineapple welch's on. damn pineapple are erotic. i want to lick pineapple juice off of.. 

i met the welch's grape juice girl once. what a bitch. she's a celebrity and she doesn't even sign autographs. 

my mom is vacuming. i hope i spelled that right.

i'm really hoping that eddie gets back from wrestling early. and i really hope i can see him tonite. 

i like fluffy animals.

i really like pink.

i really like sexy things.

i really like sexy pink things.

i have to get some lingerie. i want to strip tease and lap dance right now. uhhh. that was groaning. over the internet. i wouldn't do that alone sitting here or would i?

the dance was cancelled. i really wanted to grind with eddie. he's gonna read that. um okay. hoepfully it's reschedualed. i also was going to look sexy. 

we decided to do an original song for the talent show. it's the mac daddy shiznet ska doodle. i got to write some lyrics. 

bum shaker.

i took care of eddie last night. i held him. it was wonderful. i wouldn't let him get off the couch. except to go to the bathroom because dude- bedpans are gross. i'm still sick. he was really sweet and wouldn't let me kiss him on the lips. i cheated. lots."

i'm singing weezer's ""say it ain't so"". i'm going to be singing it in the talent show. i don't remember if i said that before.

i can't remember much.

i'm sick. snot it dripping down my nose. my nose is sore from blowing it so often.

eddie is really sexy! omigawd! i thought you should know. whoever you are. he has a really good body. it's so hot! and his smile is wondeful. his eyes are sooooo .. neat. haha.

i'm melting.

i'm not touching myself.

erik sucks. i haven't heard from him. val is getting this mullet calandar soon.

"event","so wednesday eddie goes for his liscense. he tells me tuesday night that he will call me sometime later in the day after he gets back from chris's. so i sit and i wait and i sit. i know he's getting high. he's having fun. and i was hurt. it turned into anger. i was pissed. i wanted to get back at him. i have never thought to do so many horrible things at once. i wanted to cheat on him. i wanted to get so fuct up i couldn't speak. do whip its. smoke up. whatever. i didn't care.

i think i over reacted. that's hard for me to deal with. it's embaressing. i feel bad because i made eddie feel guilty for going with his friends. i mean, just because i think weed is lame and i think it's dumb if thats the only way they know how to have fun. besides the making fun of people. i think eddie's better than that. 

but after i talked to him, i felt better. he didn't. he was upset because he got his girlfriend pissed. i told him i was more hurt. i was glad he had fun though.

i went out with kate, brian, dave, and justin. we went to the mall and to hooter's. i had the song ""in a big country"" by big country in my head all night so i bought the cd. i bought kate a barbell for her tongue for her christmas present. i met this guy chase who is friend's with mike. he was teaching me all these dances. i was trying to get my mind off of eddie but it really wasn't working.

everything is back to normal. i think. we watched ravenous and fight club yesterday. did the whole cuddle on the couch thing. it was nice. 

i feel like i'm being obsessive. i always want to be with him more than anything else. nothing else is as much fun or makes me feel as good. 

i'm happy now. and i'm not on any pills. i stopped taking the effexor the doctor put me on. it made me feel yucky. but now she wants me back on the depakote to take care of my headaches. which i tend to have a lot of.

i haven't gotten a hold of erik over vacation. i dunno what i'm going to do with his present if i don't see him. i'll probably give it to val. she was begging for it.

my friend sarah from dorney called me the other night. so i called her back yesterday and she just wanted to keep in touch and see what was up. she wants to hang out sometime so i should call her when i know i'm not doing anything. lauren was over when i called and it was nice to talk to them even though sarah was still kind of tripping and lauren was drunk. 

i've learned.. infomercials are not something you want to watch when you are depressed. they just make me cry really bad. 

i'm puzzled because i'm watching fishing and i don't know where my dad is."

there are a lot of cool words.

like mangos.. i want a mango flavored drink right now. it's late and i'm tired.. but i only ever want to sleep in his arms.. i'll go dream about him."

"event","my other journal is working again. ::yippee:: but i like this one too. just because it makes it real easy to see val's and erik's. and i love both of them to death. so today i was really tired. it wasn't cool. i have my occasional not so bad moments. like when i was conversing with my algebra teacher about the last names of the characters on saved by the bell. i also got to watch the rest of the informative video about ""lucy"" the 3 million year old ancestor of humans, the earliest bi-ped found. french was bullshit as usual. i was informed i reminded someone of a man in a girl's body. i'm still confused how to react. i also enjoyed making several of the spoons at lunch dirty for the sake of making the cooks work for their money. 

i like fish sticks. i was happy they mentioned them in the episode of seinfeld last night.

television is corrupting and all, but i wouldn't want to be addicted to anything else. maybe quacks. too late for that too. ashley needed a plastic bag today. i needed a respirator. 

eddie is cool. lets make a list. i like lists. about the things that are great about eddie. valkyrie's list about dave looked like fun- but i think her's was not up beat like i am right now. up beat. what an early ninties catch-phrase.

-his smile
-his eyes
-playing with his hair 
-wrestling him 
-tickling him
-beating him in anything and being a sore winner
-eating with him
-coughing up pretzels in his mouth
-buying him corndogs
-scaring him occasionally
-playing you don't know jack
-watching movies with his mom
-him hating his dog, me loving her
-talking to his sister more than he does
-the ed days
-laying in his arms
-waking up in his arms
-teasing him
-dressing in his clothes
-his kisses
-holding his hand
-public displays of affection to gross people out
-trips to tony's
-being the only girl for him
-splashing in puddles to get him wet
-him singing
-his e-mails
-his notes on chem paper
-his walk
-his laugh
-his ""hello""

i think he should see this.. i'll go mail it to him. but anyway- being with him is great. blaahhhhhhhh. i'm shutting up. this is long. and DRUGS SUCK. right val? word."

"event","i'm quite angered by the fact that my other journal went down the tubes. i don't know where it is, but i'm quite upset. anyway. i was wondering if fish are happy. of course there is no way of showing up as people if they are, but they can still feel because they can't show it. i wish i knew what my boyfriend was feeling all the time. and eddie, if you're reading this, this has nothing to do with you being quiet. i just wish i knew what he was feeling, so that if i said something wrong, or did something bad, i could instantly know it and correct it. i just want to be the best girlfriend to him. i want to be all he needs. he's all i need. so far anyway. i'm hoping i don't get any desires to find out whether i could be happier with someone else again. and his friends don't help much, considering they dislike me. but he told me i shouldn't worry about them, so i won't. but i will. hmmm, i think i'll go blow my time so other way now. i wish erik wans't busy right now so i could talk to him, he's always entertaining. but he is. so i won't. so i'm off to go find other means of entertainment."

<p><em>Your result for The Color Code Test...</em></p><h3>Color Code: BLUE: The Social Butterfly</h3><p>3% Red,  46% Blue,  43% White and  9% Yellow!</p><p style=""text-align:center""><img src=""http://cdn.okcimg.com/php/load_okc_image.php/images/0x0/0x0/0/16834966438493164485.jpeg"" width=""400"" height=""400"" /></p><div><p><strong>Here is the basics: For a more in depth analysis, I suggest you look up the Color Code, and take a more intensive test. </strong></p>
<p><strong>BLUE MOTIVE: Intimacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>BLUE NEEDS: To be good (morally), To be understood, To be appreciated, Acceptance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BLUE WANTS: To reveal insecurities, Quality, Autonomy, Secuirity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY: Blues are motivated by altruism. They love to do nice things for others. they look for opportunites to give up something in order to bring another person happiness. selflessness rather than selfishness is their guiding philosophy. Blues seek intimacy. They want to be loved and to love. A true blue will sacrifice a successful career to improve an important relationship. Blues crave being understood. They are gratified when they are listened to, when they feel understood and appreciated. Blues may have thier hearts broken more than most people, but they also spend much more time in love. Blues are directed by a strong moral conscience. They have a moral code that guides them in their decision making, their value judgements, and their leisure time. A blue would rather lose than cheat. Ethically, blues are people who should be in positions of power, but seldom are. </strong></p></div><p><a href=""http://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/the-color-code-test"">Take The Color Code Test</a> at <a href=""http://www.helloquizzy.com/""><b style=""color:#131313""><span style=""color:#ac000c"">H</span>ello<span style=""color:#ac000c"">Q</span>uizzy</b></a></p>"

"event","I went to see the movie this w/e with the kind company of Kitty and Stevity (I didn't even talk through the whole thing). It was good, but I could not connect emotionally with the characters. I felt a little like I was being beat about the head with the whole terrorist thing. Plus, I wanted to be blown away with THX of Iron Man... AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN PLAY THE WHOLE SONG. WhatEVER. Robert Downey, Jr., who as an actor I really like did a fantastic job as Stark - womanizing, brilliant, and some of the scenes were pretty funny when he was creating his invention, but all and all, I am still a V and Spidey and Batman girl at heart, I guess. I like the dark and tortured pasts, the struggling genius, the deformed and crazy brilliance, I suppose I think they are just deeper characters. Where's the conflict if you are handed everything on a silver platter?"

You are the sort of person that needs a peaceful environment. You seek release from stress and freedom from conflicts and disagreements, of which you seem to have had more than your fair share. But you are taking pains to control the situation by proceeding cautiously and you are right in doing so as you are a very sensitive person.

Of late, everything seems to be going so slowly - far slower than you anticipated - and this is causing you much anxiety and frustration. It would appear that there is little you can do about the series of events that now seem to be taking place. In spite of the fact that you feel like 'giving up' - don't. Take a deep breath and start over again and you will find that eventually the expression 'All's well that ends well' will have an extra special meaning for you.

There are times of everyone's life when 'compromise' is the name of the game and this is the time, so you have no alternative but to forgo some pleasures for the time being. You are capable of achieving satisfaction through physical activity.

You are frustrated and stressed. You appreciate the finer things in life but at all times you appear to stay aloof, critical of everything and everyone about you. You will not be carried away by your emotions and you refuse to trust anyone or any situation unless genuineness and integrity can be absolutely vouched for. Therefore, you keep a strict and watchful control on your feelings as you must know exactly where you stand at all times. You demand complete sincerity as a protection against your own tendency to be too trusting.

You are inclined to be too trusting and you feel that you need to be on your guard against the possibility that your endeavours and actions may be misunderstood. Too often you have been taken advantage of and you have been mentally abused. Now you are seeking a relationship which can provide peace of mind, where you can be yourself and not have the need to put on a false front."

""True"" Friendship
None of that sissy crap. Are you tired of those sissy ""friendship"" poems that always sound good,
But never actually come close to reality?
Well, here is a series of promises that actually speak of true friendship.
You will see no cute little smiley faces on this card. Just the stone cold truth of our great friendship.

1. When you are sad -- I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against
the sorry bastard who made you sad.
 
2. When you are blue -- I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.
 
3. When you smile -- I will know you are thinking of something that I would
probably want to be involved in. 
 
4. When you are scared -- I will rag you about it every chance I get until
you're not.
 
5. When you are worried -- I will tell you horrible stories about how much
worse it could be until you quit whining.
 
6. When you are confused -- I will try to use only little words.
 
7. When you are sick -- Stay the hell away from me until you are well again
I don't want whatever you have.
 
8. When you fall -- I will laugh at your clumsy ass but I'll help you up.
 
9. This is my oath.... I pledge it to the end. ""Why?"" you may ask;
""because you are my friend"".
 
Friendship is like peeing in your pants, everyone can see it, But only you
can feel the true warmth."

No one can see that child but you
If I hold on to you too tight, you understand
You hold me too
You are the one who reaches through the dark
When I'm afraid, you warm the air
And, when I close my eyes to sleep
You are my peace, you are my prayer
You are my home
You make me strong
And in this world of strangers
I belong to someone
You are all I know
You're all I have
I won't let go
Others may leave, but you will still be there
Touching the tears that fill my eyes
When I am lost, you are my light
You are the love that never dies
You are my home
You make me strong
And in this world of strangers
I belong to someone
You are all I know
You're all I have
I need you so
I will not walk away from you!
I will not let you go!
You're the only home I'll ever know
You are my home
You make me strong
And in this world of strangers
I belong to someone
You are all I know
You're all I have
I need you so
I won't let go
You are my home"

coin operated boy
sitting on the shelf he is just a toy
but i turn him on and he comes to life
automatic joy
that is why i want a coin operated boy

made of plastic and elastic
he is rugged and long-lasting
who could ever ever ask for more
love without complications galore
many shapes and weights to choose from
i will never leave my bedroom
i will never cry at night again
wrap my arms around him and pretend....

coin operated boy
all the other real ones that i destroy
cannot hold a candle to my new boy and i'll
never let him go and i'll never be alone
not with my coin operated boy......

this bridge was written to make you feel smittener
with my sad picture of girl getting bitterer
can you extract me from my plastic fantasy
i didnt think so but im still convinceable
will you persist even after i bet you
a billion dollars that i'll never love you
will you persist even after i kiss you
goodbye for the last time
will you keep on trying to prove it?
i'm dying to lose it...
i want it
i want you
i want a coin operated boy.

and if i had a star to wish on
for my life i cant imagine
any flesh and blood could be his match
i can even take him in the bath

coin operated boy
he may not be real experienced with girls
but i know he feels like a boy should feel
isnt that the point that is why i want a
coin operated boy
with his pretty coin operated voice
saying that he loves me that hes thinking of me
straight and to the point
that is why i want
a coin operated boy."

I haven't posted in a bit, and plenty of reasons for that. New Job. Leaving one is stressful, and preparing for another - a teaching job! - is also very stressful. I keep reminding myself of the vacation days! LOL.
I will miss kitty, so very much, every day I do not see her. She is my rock, my emotional stone and wall and sounding board and advice giver and best friend, and I will be worse for not seeing her and having the pleasure of her company every day. I am spoiled.
I won't miss a million other things that happen here, and I am sure to quickly compile a list of things I will hate at the new job, not having any aides in an elementary library being foremost among them.
I have been in closer touch with people lately, friends from all periods of my life and it is good and bad. I fell in love, but then went unreciprocated. Better to have loved and lost? Me thinks Bill was full of the proverbial english shite.
Enough for now. Love you dearies."

Love : pretty self evident, what I feel for my friends, and family, and my potential significant other.

Lacerate : what I do to myself far too often. Stupid shower head falling on me!

Lavish : something I like to do to the people I love, with affection, or laughter, or as kitty can attest, phone calls.

Labyrinth : a movie I will likely never watch again, as David Bowie creeped me out. Also, where Erik lives, on a lake, through one, five cellars below.

Loser : I'm a loser baby! So why don't you kill me! *sings*

This is like homework.

Halfway done.

Lick : done to ice cream and Lance Burton, and Rain on IM by me. Heh.

London : where I lived for 3 months, and would love to revisit, given time and money.

Lackadaisical : full of whimsy, and drowsy thoughts, and terrific to say, impossible to spell. If you are really that devoid of life and energy, you would not attempt to use this word to describe yourself. 

Laconic : something I am most definitely not, but I am sure others wish I was. SHUT UP ALREADY!

Longing : the bane of human existance along with hope. These two things are the salvation as well.

And one for extra credit - 

Loopy : if you don't know why this applies to me, then you don't really know me, do you?"

"event","Sorry to say there wasn't a great deal of sinning going on. We had a great time, despite the Craposphere, and AirCrap. Word of warning. Do not fly AirTran into or out of Philly or Atlanta. Do not stay at the Stratosphere. Now, I will grant that some of the problems we encountered while traveling were not the fault of AirTran, rather that of the airports, Philadelphia in particular. But losing half a day in Vegas due to a missed connection due to stupid Philly? Frankly that sucks.

And the Stratosphere? Despite a fantastic view of the strip, which even hotel guests have to pay for after 2 pm, is F.A.R. From everything. Except overpriced tattoo parlors. And IHOP. That was cool. But we lost much time in trying to take the trolly from place to place the first 2 days, and then lost a boatload of money on cabs. Cos the Strat? It's like far and stuff. From everything. I'm sorry, did I say that twice? Walking a mile in 102 degree heat just to get to the nearest ""real"" casino is not fun. 

Glad to be home, but I wonder where the promise of summer lies in the 60's we have here? *shivers*

Kat gets pros for the best quote of the trip, her rendition of Slots o' fun. That got a lot of milage, and giggles. I have to say that the Mike's Hard Lemonade Disney inspired sing-a-long will not soon be forgotten!

Kitty wins for the most unsolicted comments from Hisanic porn vendors on the street. I am glad we only took her outside those two times, or they would have started following her with more lewd and awesome comments, to be sure.

I married two men, and was glad to have my two best buds out there to help me through the painful annulments of each. I will never forget you... ummm.... oh right. Lance. Lance and Aaron. ;)"

I am just starting to get excited about it, even though I bought my ticket in March. Sometimes I think the trip might be wasted on someone as straight-laced as me, and then I think, Yeah, who am I kidding? *needs to research ""male companions"" and Vegas*"

The obsession continues: I bought V for Vendetta the graphic novel through Half.com. *is waiting impatiently for it to arrive* I have been a fan fic whore the last couple of days, with phantom fic. Those crazy men in masks mystify this Merlyn. 
I have been trying to learn from my kittys the kinds of rubbins they like. Turns out none, really. LOL. I have been driving my new car, I have to make my first of 60 payments on it next week. I got my plates last night. The first part reads UMS, which I thought was cute for me. Ummmmmmmmmmmmssssss. I gots lots of those. 
We have an all day meeting here at work tomorrow about branding. It promises to be boring, but I'll let you know what it is all about on Friday... Sounds a little concentration camp for my tastes. If they bring out the irons and light a fire, you may be hearing from me early tomorrow morning, for I'll have left the building screaming and will need to update immediately. That is all, for now! Cheers!"

NOW, take your total and find out which Movie Star you are:

(10-17 points) You are MADONNA: You are wild and crazy and you know it. You
know how to have fun, but you may take it to extremes. You know what you are
doing though, and are much in control of your own life. People don't always
see things your way, but that doesn't mean that you should do away with your
beliefs. Try to remember that your wild spirit can lead to hurting yourself
and others.

(18-26 points) You are DORIS DAY: You are fun, friendly, and popular! You are a real crowd pleaser. You have probably been out on the town your share of times, yet you come home with the values that your mother taught you. Marriage and children are very important to you, but only after you have
fun. Don't let the people you please influence you to stray.

(27-34 points) You are DEBBIE REYNOLDS: You are cute, and everyone loves you. You are a best friend that no one takes the chance of losing. You never hurt anyone and seldom have your own feelings hurt. Life is a breeze. You are witty, and calm most of the time. Just keep clear of back stabbers, and you are worry-free.

(35-42 points) You are GRACE KELLY: You are a lover. Romance, flowers, and wine are all you need to enjoy yourself. You are serious about all commitments and are a family person. You call your Mom every Sunday, and never forget a Birthday. Don't let your passion for romance get confused
with the real thing.

(43-50 points) You are KATHERINE HEPBURN: You are smart, a real thinker. Every situation is approached with a plan. You are very healthy in mind and body. You don't take crap from anyone. You have only a couple of individuals that you consider ""real friends"". You teach strong family values. Keep your feet planted in your positive point of view, but don't overlook a bad situation when it does happen.

(51-60 points) You are ELIZABETH TAYLOR: Everyone is in awe of you. You know what you want and how to get it. You have more friends than you know what to do with. Your word is your bond. Everyone knows when you say something it is money in the bank. You attract the opposite sex. Your intelligence overwhelms most. Your memory is the next thing to photographic. Everyone admires you because you are so considerate and lovable. You know how to enjoy life and treat people right."

"event","First I would like everyone to know, and you *were* sitting on the edge of your seat to know, I DID go Wednesday night to see Woman in White, and I am glad I did, despite the fact the audience sat on its hands. It was an interesting staging, where they relied heavily on projected back drops, with some props and large set pieces. It was to neat effect. I had never seen anything quite like it, except maybe Rocky Horror, only more advanced and with better singing. It was the first of the MANY stage shows I have seen where the majority of the cast were the ones on the cast recording, and that was also very cool. I got to see Michael Ball perform, and any theater buff will know who he is, I have heard him so much, it was cool to see him in person, and as a bad guy ;). So YAY! It was worth the late bed time. I called and not only did I get a seat for the evening performance I was upgraded to first row mezzanine, center. AWESOME seat! So *see me happy*.
The other thing, on a sadder note, is that I just heard about the cancellation of Arrested Development. I am very distraught. This show, with the exception of maybe Family Guy, is, or was, one of the best comedies on TV. It made me LOL at least once during every episode, a rare feat for canned network comedies. I LOVE this show. Anyone out there looking for a gift idea would score beaucoup points attaining this for me on DVD. So another worthy TV show bites it. Maybe Showtime will pick it up. Cross your fingers, my friends.

I want to wish kitty and Steveity best of luck on their move in the blizzard of '06. I hope they are all stocked up and safely snuggled in their new collective digs before the worst of it hits. :)
Also, will someone catch Rain's brain, please? It appears to be leaking out of her head. I *knew* she had too many thoughts for a normal brained person... *hugs to all and to all a good weekend!*"

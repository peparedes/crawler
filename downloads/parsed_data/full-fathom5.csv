"event","<p>Turns out the famous filler-copy text has a real history. Ha!<br /><br />&quot;Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It  has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making  it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at  Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure  Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through  the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the  undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by  Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of  ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem  Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section  1.10.32.&quot;</p>http://www.lipsum.com/<br />-"

"event","we came up with a scheme to shoot a documentary about the interface between Southern culture and the martial arts. Basically, we both observed that rednecks absolutely love Karate, and that, despite the weirdness of it, the misappropriation, misunderstandings, and ridiculous malapropisms of it, it made total sense to everyone inside of that subculture.<br /><br />And it would make sense to you, too, in a strange anthropological sense, when the camera shows you the thousands of kids and teenagers preparing for the Battle of Atlanta, which was and may still be the largest point-sparring tournament in the Southeast. When you see how Chuck Norris is idolized not only as a movie star, but also as a born-again Christian hero, and how dojo masters, regardless of whether they were white or African American, would often evaluate the legitimacy of another dojo master based on his commitment to God and family values.<br /><br />And there was the self-help aspect of it. How it was very easy to reinterpret Asian philosophy to focus on individual empowerment. Strange since that idea is quite alien to a classically Asian worldview. There are tons of mirrors in Karate dojos, things that sort of reinforce the sense that someone's always watching you. I imagine this is the reason aerobics classes use mirrors. But there's something about the internalization of discipline, of following orders to kick and punch on command, that shows the Totalitarian undercurrent in some martial arts.<br /><br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Hong_Hi"">General Choi</a>, the founder of Tae Kwon Do, was a soldier in the Japanese army before returning to his native North Korea. There's probably an interesting book to be written there; the founder of a sport that &quot;revived&quot; a practically dead Korean martial art, put together hodgepodge out of Japanese techniques and some things Choi dreamed up himself, returned into the hands of a Communist nation ... but once transmitted through the relatively &quot;peaceful&quot; Korean south, took America by storm in the 80s/90s ... .<br /><br />Tae Kwon Do isn't very individualistic. You could argue that it even carries the logic of modern mechanization within its teachings -- standardized kicks, standardized punches, standardized units of exercises (20 pushups, 100 jumping jacks, 50 pushups on knuckles only), military-style formations and drills. (Plus lots of techniques based straight lines and curves along regular arcs ... what I understand to be the &quot;modern&quot; contribution of General Choi's teachings; that it could be rapidly taught, reproduced, practiced, and efficiently used in the field.) Shouting is permitted and encouraged, but only at the appropriate times.<br /><br />Of course it might be hyperbolic to make so much of one sport ... but really it is unique. I mean, compare to baseball, which the Japanese have taken to with similarly militaristic organization. One man on the mound; one man at bat; then soldiers in the background, poised in support of the main drama between single combatants. ... or compare with European football. Totally, totally different.<br />-"

"event","I quit smoking the Thursday after Memorial Day, which capped off the end of a weekend full of moving heavy heavy objects from my apartment on DeKalb Ave to my current place on Oakdale Road. The moving was interspersed with copious drinking with M. Castricone, who came to visit that weekend. Now that Labor Day has passed, it's almost been four months without cigarettes. I am proud.

However, much of that time was spent while using the patch. I definitely underestimated how hard it is to transition from ""just a little nicotine"" to ""zero nicotine"" .... I've done it before, and it's nowhere near as difficult as stopping the physical act of smoking cigarettes. Still, I feel another knot coming loose as my body tumbles through another psycho/physical transition.

In this short period of time finally without nicotine, my appetite has started to come back after years of perhaps unintentionally using cigarettes as a meal supplement. And I suddenly crave chocolate, of all things. Plus I tend to lose my concentration around midday or in the afternoon and have difficulty concentrating on more than one thing at once.

Chocolate ...."

"event","My writing is rusty. I'm skipping some the parties this weekend, because I have writing work to catch up on. And why am I&nbsp;stuck dealing with leftovers when I should have had enough/made enough time to do it last week? Because I'm out of practice, out of the rhythm, out of the Zen of writing the daily Word.<br /><br />I've spent very little time this year working on my own portfolio and, instead, I've been spending more time helping everyone else. I've made sacrifices, compromises, and basically decided, renounced myself to what must be done (probably sometime around September), that building a team of writers who I can trust and rely upon is more important than writing solo. And even that hasn't been easy.<br /><br />Being an editor makes people grumpy, and even the best of intentions sometimes translates to &quot;Jeremy doesn't have enough time for me. Who does he think he is?&quot; And even though quitting smoking makes me even grumpier than before ... I'm learning to be more patient still. If Patience is a Virtue, if it's a road to Sainthood, then too bad I don't believe in heaven.

She spent all day cooking a <em>huge</em> dinner, and the cold she's been fighting for the past week must have finally caught up with her. Even though she slept a full night the day before, and took several short naps yesterday, she was very obviously fatigued despite all the rest. And she looked soo cute.

She's sleeping now and I'm spending the day fooling with technology stuff. Things like Apache and PHP and Virtual Private Servers and secure shells, which are all fun but honestly (just a little) over my head. Wish me luck?"

The first part is a semiotic analysis of the original footage -- the second plane crash, the horrible cloud of dust rushing toward the camera and at screaming people on the ground, etc. -- within a greater media/pop culture intertext. Basically, he's trying to figure out how these images are perceived by a television audience, and what that tells us about our era. None of the essays are especially strong, although I'd probably appreciate his assessment of world politics if I knew <em>a lot</em> more about the Cold War. (Cuba and Yugoslavia are among his favorite examples.) I don't find him nearly as offensive as most seem to believe he is; he even gives a sentence or two in praise of the American passengers who ambushed their hijackers over PA. (Nevermind the conspiracy theories that say these audio tapes are fake; Zizek finished writing and had published through a London press in 2002, before the US had even invaded Iraq.)<br />"

"event","We arrived back in Atlanta at 3 a.m. the next day, after a minor tire-related delay in Gainesville. It was Tuesday morning. Already.<br /><br />I did nothing yesterday: I slept. I woke up. I went shopping and did an errand with very little ambition, before going to sleep, again. I read <em>Great Gatsby</em> and made short work of it, watched some Jon Stewart, and then finally went to bed.<br /><br /><em>Gatsby.</em> Another title in my growing laundry list of Books Most Everyone Else Read Years Ago, but Were Unable to Explain to Me Why They're Any Good. I liked this one, and can see why it might have influenced other writers. <br /><br />I know at least two who shadowed Fitzgerald. The young Hunter Thompson copied his words, most likely on a typewriter, furiously absorbing the voice, one key at a time. I can see similarities between <em>Gatsby </em>and passages in both <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> as well as <em>Rum Diaries</em>. <br /><br />And the other writer? Haruki Murakami. Murakami was initially known in Japan simply for his work as a translator. (For instance, of Raymond Carver and other Americans.) When he wrote <em>Wind Up Bird Chronicle</em>,&nbsp; Murakami had still never used a typewriter or keyboard for his short stories or novels. He wrote them all longhand, vertically, into the common square-grid-lined paper used for everyday Japanese. Even so, he told his biographer that writing phrases in English was an exercise he often employed for simplifying his ideas and achieving a more modern, conversational style. The model was commonly Fitzgerald, the author he shadowed as a teenager.<br /><br />I had hoped the Florida trip would be a nice, though much less epic, approximation of <em>Rum Diaries</em>. It wasn't quite that, but it was still excellent. <br /><br />It was nice to see you. :-)<br />*<br />"

Though I may amend that earlier statement to <em>(I think) I (may) have a temper(, still)</em>. It's true that when I was a child, I would have sudden bouts of fury.  I also cursed like a sailor at the age of 2. But people who know me now all seem to believe that I'm a thoroughly ""gentle soul,"" which I think is about 90% true. 

I was at the Carlos Museum this weekend (which I now like to think of as My Museum), listening to a tour on the Asian exhibit. When you trade ideas with literate, mostly highly literate people most of the time, it's easy to forget the kind of expectations the general public has when they enter a museum; for instance, one lady couldn't identify the image of the Buddha.  

It's a typical Indian statue, though to her credit the head is missing (like most statues from antiquity). She commented <em>But I thought all Buddhas were fat</em>. 

Growing up in front of the television has consequences."

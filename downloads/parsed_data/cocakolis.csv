He still won't open his hands, but you know what if something's wrong something's wrong.  There's nothing we can do about it now so its all wait and see even though the wait time is ticking like a time bomb of sorts.  

In as little as 4 weeks I could officially be a daddy.  It just makes me feel old.  Scary as all get out, but I'm excited for it all the same.

We're road tripping to Lima, OH this weekend for Rachel's grandparents 60th anniversary.  The only reason we're driving is because Rachel's too far along to fly so its 10+ hrs in a car.  I haven't been on an honest to goodness road trip since sophmore yr of college spring break (moving doesn't count)  So this could be somewhat fun if I don't go broke paying for gas.

I will be in Minny in October at least.  Probably my only trip this year after the baby comes which means I will miss State Fair for the first time in 10 years.  Any chance someone's willing to flash freeze some decent cheese curds and a scotch egg and ship it down here?

Oh well,  talk to you in three months..."

Anyways, we bought a crib today.  Yet another thing that makes this pregnancy that much more real.  Its still a bit surreal right now since Rachel is barely showing and theres nothing physical to touch yet so my brain keeps telling me nothings different.  That'll all change soon enough though.

We took the window film off of half the windows in the house today since it was nearly 70.  It so weird thinking its february and its light jacket weather.  Theres a bush flowering in our front yard.  Hell usually on my birthday next month we usually get dumped on with a foot of snow, but at least dealing with the 'shocking' weather is easier to cope with than the changes occurring due to the baby.  Don't get me wrong, I'm excited as hell, but dreading the loss of social life and further responsibilities tethering me down."

"event","Well fuck.  I'm thinking I'm getting some major sympathy pains / pregnancy side effects, the biggest of which is what my wife calls pregnancy brain.  Basically, I'm more out of it than I normally am.  Maybe I'm distracted about worrying about money, lead paint in the house, baby proofing stuff, never having a social life with my single, childless friends again.  

One big result of pregnancy brain is doing stupid things, like washing your cell phone because you forgot to check your pants pockets.  I don't know if its lucky or not, but we have a front loader so it uses less water, but I'm sure it was more than enough to fry the battery.  The little white sticker that turns red when it gets wet (to void your warranty) is bright red and I've got all sorts of condensation in the screen.  I took everything apart that I could and am going to try to dry the damn thing out.  Anyone think I could find the little screwdriver I need to crack the case and make sure everything is dry before popping a new battery in and shorting everything out?  I was going to swing by a radio shack and this local computer shop to see if they might have them, but I'm not holding out much hope.

"event","Been awhile again, but I've been busy. There's one main reason I've been rather busy and that's the fact that Rachel is pregnant and we've been dealing with the morning sickness and all other sorts of fun things to deal with after the initial freak out of figuring out that we're expecting.  I guess I should say Rachel's been dealing with the morning sickness and I've been dealing with the aftermath and odd craving runs already  (She's been on an ICEE kick lately).  She had the first appt last week where the Dr. thinks she's about 8 weeks along which puts conception pretty much the first weekend we were in the new house.  We've got the first sonogram this week and we'll get a due date then.  In the meantime the guest room that never got completed is now being transformed into the nursery so that's where the focus of my renovations go for now...

  our flight to Milwaukee yesterday was cancelled due to dense fog so were staying here.  The soonest we could've flown out was this evening, but it sounds like with the crosswinds they're experiencing there today that that wouldn't have happenened either.  Racehl's brother was scheduled to fly out to ATL last night and he's delayed until Monday afternoon.  We just didn't want to spend another day in the airport to be delayed or cancelled again, plus a we were worried about getting back on time on Wednesday since Rachel HAS to be back at work for year end giving. We scored some vouchers in not going and its not like we don't have Rachel's family here to celebrate with, but I was all excited to go home and do our traditions, make a trip to chicago for Pizza and all and what not.

In other news Rachel and I went to some swanky christmas party last night for the Captain Planet Foundation (Yes, that Captain Planet!  THE POWER IS YOURS!)  Her work was one of recipients of the money raised so she was able to score some free $500 a pop VIP tickets.  I was the most out of my element I've ever been as this things was like something I would imagine Paris Hilton attending.  We saw some guy that may or may not have been Elton John (everyone was taking pictures with him but I'm not sure), Ed Begley Jr, and Ted Turner (its his daughter's foundation).  Plus the whole thing was hosted by the guy that was the voice of Captain Planet in the cartoons and he kept saying ""The power is yours!"" over and over again, probably because he hasn't done anything else in 18 years.  There was free food and full bar which was cool but it was just weird though, all the beautiful people and us enjoying the night and all.  They had some photographer running around taking pictures of a bunch of rich people and I kept trying to get in the background and ruin their shots.  Funny the guy never took a shot of Rachel and me... There were some little prissy girls that actually paid someone to make their hair look like a birdsnest and have one of those giant glittery foam balls wrapped into their hair and there was some aging trophy wife with way too much plastic surgery that was wearing a lime green vinyl mini skirt that had a mermaid tail on it. It was so awesome to sit back and look at the crazy things that people with money do, but kinda sad at the same time.  I almost felt like I was back at high school being the outsider invited to the popular kids party.

The thing that sucked the most though was the fact that the party costs about $300,000 to put on and it only raises about $30,000 of which Rachel's work will only see a third of.  So basically I think its amusing that they have to spend 10x the amount they really raise just so these people have something to do on a friday night.  So frickin weird."

Our computer is in what I'm calling the den, the one room that wasn't in photographs on the realtor's photo page.  Its technically our third bedroom, but its about 13'x16' and big enough for a sleeper couch, the spare tv and the computer desk, plus the best part is its completely paneled floor to ceiling  in this swedish style pine paneling from the 50's that is just enough northwoods for me to make me feel like I'm still up in MN in this room.  (It's also our guest room if anyone needs a place to crash while in ATL or coming through)  No cheap paneling here, this stuff is almost an inch thick, its pretty cool.  All the retro paneling with my modern crazy architecture man furniture has this cool juxtaposition that really works.

Anyways, I'll be up in the cities this weekend for one of my best friend's weddings up in Ham Lake,  looking forward to the cold ironically enough.  It may also be my only chance to see some snow this winter...

So anyways Rachel and I are applying to be on HGTV to see if we can get on any shows since they film a ton of them in the ATL metro and we have no money to decorate right now.  The one we think we have the best shot is Deserving Design with Vern Yip.  We're hoping a cross country move and Rachel working for a Homeless Children's Shelter with the combination of our first house and being relatively newly married will qualify us for experiencing enough 'life altering change' recently.

Buying this house is going to cost us a bunch in the first place, but everything else we'll need will add up pretty quick too.  As of right now we still need to purchase , shower rods and curtains, a washer and dryer, lawnmower, microwave, spare bed or sleeper sofa for my Mom to sleep on when she comes down for Thanksgiving and maybe some kind of rain barrel so I can water our young trees with the crazy ass drought down here.  And that's only the relatively absolute needs.  We could use matching dining room chairs since we now have a dining room, and a bunch of other things like an outdoor grill and chairs, miscellaneous tables and furniture, and a shitload of groceries since we have nada.  We're going to be extremely poor for the next few months which sucks, but having a house will be worth it, eventually.  We've set up an online gift registry at Crate and Barrel and a couple of other places, not for people to actually buy things for us, but solely so we can get the 20% discount to ""complete"" our registry after our ""event""  We're doing the normal scouring craigslist and will be visiting goodwill and the like, but its a bit harder being 10 miles out of the city in the burbs.

"event","So the house hunt continues.  We saw 7 houses on saturday, 6 of them were already vacant.  One of those 6, the only house we remotely liked is a flip by a realtor who thinks she knows everything (ie I'm a professional decorator, I know the market and this house is already underpriced so I won't take a penny under asking) HA!  It was a 50's Ranch with a basement that she had put some new light fixtures into, sanded the floors and added (cheap) granite countertops to the kitchen.  It was maybe 1200 sq feet and she was asking $199,987.  First off what the hell is up with the 987?   But seriously no one is going to pay that for this house.  Sure it looks cute, but there wasn't much for usable space and we know we can get more for our money.

The other 6 houses we saw were crap.  80's and 90's builder specials that you could blow on and they'd fall over.  I think we're sticking to looking for older homes that may need a little updating, but at least we'll know the house is built a bit better.  It's fun but frustrating.  We've got a ton more to go though on saturday again.  Hopefully we find something this weekend."

I miss hockey enormously down here.  The Wild home opener was last night and this is the first time in a long time I wasn't there.  It's really odd not going.  I was going to get season tickets to the minor league team down here in a close suburb, but with buying the house we don't have the money to spare upfront.  Worst of all the cable at my in-laws doesn't carry Versus or have the option of buying the Center Ice subscription package so my chances of seeing a non Thrashers hockey game are pretty much nil until we get a place of our own...

In all likelyhood I just haven't found the good places yet, but the local breweries around here can't hold a candle to Surly.  Everything here just lacks umph.  I don't know what it is, but its all so just bland.  There looks to be a promising microbrewery ala Granite City called 5 Seasons Brewing, but I haven't tried it yet.  The worst part is, I'm having a hell of a time finding decent beers in the 'package stores' as they call the here (And I thought 'Bottle Shops' was funny)  Besides the typical Guinness, Harp and Bass I haven't found a single place with any good imports from the UK or Europe.  No English Ales, no bitters, nothing in the neighborhood shops around me out in the burbs.  I already miss Surdyk's and France 44.  I haven't seen a single Belgian on the shelf anywhere, but I've got to do some more research.  
  I've actually curbed my drinking quite a but here, mainly due to the fact that I'm living with the in-laws and they don't allow alcohol in the house which gives me just one more reason to get going on finding a house.  Other than that we're spoiled here.   haven't cooked in 2 months, I've got a 4 mile drive to work which means I only fill up once every week and a half compared to every 3-4 days and I'm not paying any bills except cell phone and $200/month for our stuff in storage.

We got approved for a sizable mortgage and are meeting with a realtor to find our new home on Saturday.  The guys seems nice enough, but we'll see in person.  He doesn't look like the typical realtor.  You wouldn't see his mug with a cheesy smile on the back of a bus bench, he's more of a software engineer type of looking guy which is just fine by me.

I've only got one thing left tying me to Minnesota now, my license plate.  Last weekend Rachel and I got Georgia Driver's Licenses and had to surrender our MN ones.  I forgot that most states actually give you your new license on the spot after a short wait unlike the 2-3 weeks it was in MN.  I'll keep my plates until March, then get GA plates since they register by the birth month of the car owner.

Oh and our MN cell phones are being deactivated this weekend so if you have any desire whatsoever to have my ATL number drop me a line at briankolis-at-gmail-dot-com.

Steve called me about 6:30 CST to let me know about the bridge collapse before it was even on CNN and MSNBC down here, ironically enough he's the one that called me about 9/11 too.

There were two main reasons why I was freaking out.   The first was mostly just the shock and the shear number of times I crossed that bridge, minimally 600 times a year when I worked for TEA 2.  In hact if I was still there there would've been a great possibility trhat I would've been on that bridge on my way home at the very time it collapsed.  I usually crossed the bridge around 6-6:15 everyday.  The second was that I swore I saw my sister's car in the river and she was one of the few people not have called me back until around 9pm.  She's got a pretty conspicous car like me, except hers is a deep red Mercury SUV with certain stickers on the back that matched one of the cars half submerged in the river.  I called and called and called to no avail and when she finally called she hadn't even heard about the bridge collapse and the first thing she asked me was if it hindered her passage to Red Robin in Arden Hills ...?!?!?!?

We actually stopped off for an extra day because the cat wasn't liking being cooped up in his kennel for so long.  So after a 9hr day the first day we only drive 6 on wednesday and stopped off in Nashville for the night.  Unbeknownst to us the president was flying into Nashivlle on thursday and our hotel was right next to the airport.  As we were packing up the car we saw air force one fly over head en route to the landing strip.  Luckily I was smart enough to ask the front desk people about a back way to the interstate outside of the city because they typicall close ALL the interstates that are on the route the president will be taking so we got to see alittle more of Nashville than we were planning but it wasn't much more than a half hr tacked on to the trip and after 15 hrs of driving that wasn't so bad.

I had my last day on the new job today, which was even weirder since I was only there for little more the 2 months.  I never really got to know people all that well there since, 1.  No one's ever really in the office, and 2.  When people are we're all in separate spaces so you rarely talked to anyone unless you needed something from them.  Needless there was an awkward lunch in my going away honor which was still almost a getting to know you lunch.  The job was pretty fun to start and I'll admit I got a bit bored toward the end when things started to slow down some after I got on top of the learning curve, but work is work and I'm glad I worked there.  It definitely helped to see the contractor's side of things, plus I know a bit more of what I exactly need to draw and such, though the work in Georgia will be completely different.

Anyways, we're looking to buy a home down in GA and we've started looking online a bit but we won't buy anything without seeing it first in person.  We'll probably end up up in or around the Roswell, Marietta, Alpharetta area, which is fine with me being out in the burbs.  I just have to make sure that we can do our grocery shopping at Harry's farmers market so I have the off chance of running into Alton Brown when Good Eats is in production.  This is going to sound a bit dumb to some people, but I think I'm most excited about different food.  I like new and different things and while I'm far from having eaten everything the twin cities has to offer I feel like everything is just the same old same old right now.  I'm sure in 10 years or however long it'll be the same in Georgia, but change is good.  Even the fast food is different there with ChikFilA, Sonic, Whataburger and that's just a start.

"event","Man this is all happening so fast.  I'm having problems sleeping.  In somewhat relevant news I'm amazed at what type of raise in income I've gotten over the last year.  I was just checking some numbers and this new job is something like a 25% increase in pay total compensation wise from my current job, which in turn was somewhere around a 20% increase from what I was getting at TEA2 when I quit which was something like a 30% raise from what I was getting previous to threatening to leave in november, so if I'm doing my math correctly I've nearly doubled my payrate from this time last year.  I went from being paid $14/hr to being paid just shy of $27/hr come the end of July.  Our plans for a house are coming much faster, especially since housing is considerably cheaper (and cheaply built) down there.  I'm completely flabbergasted when I look at that, after I sat for three years languishing on intern type pay despite the work I was doing this is all beginning to work out.  I'm not going to be rich by any means, but I'll definitely be more comfortable, plus I'm not getting paid that yet and its going to cost us around $3-4g's to move everything down, and Rachel doesn't have a job lined up yet, so there will be some recouping time.

They seemed impressed by my knowledge of materials and my drawing abilities for my age, but since I've never done commercial I've got a steep learning curve ahead of me if they hire me.  I did play up some of my technical knowledge that would transfer well and it sounds like the reason they flew me down is because they're slowly expanding into mixed use retail / residential.  Previous to about a year ago their mixed use was nearly all retail / office.  It'd be the biggest firm that I've ever worked at but 45 people is not the largest of them out there by far.  The building its in is great.  Its an old textile mill from the mid 1800's and there are tons of ruins around there that are even older.  Its still weird to me to think there is stuff in the us from the 1600's and earlier just because there really isn't much around the midwest prior to the late 1800's.  I don't know.  So tomorrow I'll know a bit better about my future."

"event","So my trip down to Georgia is on Tuesday.  I leave here at 6:30 am which means I'm going to be up at 4am in order to get to the airport on time.  At least I'm flying out of the Humphrey terminal which goes a bit faster through security, but its going to be a long day.  I get to ATL just before 10am EST and then have a nerve wracking 45 minute ride on MARTA from the south end of the line to the north end of the line in Sandy Springs.  Not nerve wracking that its public transport, but the fact that its an agonizing hour of stops every 3 minutes on my way to what is shaping up to be one of the most important interviews of my life to this point.  I'm wishing there was an express train. This interview will shape where and how I'll live for at minimum the next few years and I've been nervous about the interview since I got off the phone one last Thursday.

So my interview is scheduled for 11am, and my flight out is at 4pm, which means other than on public transport and my time waiting in the airport, I'll be in GA for maybe a total of three hours.  Its a whirlwind trip, but pretty exciting.  I'm thinking they must like what they've seen and heard of me already to invest over $300 in flying me down and the job itself is very promising, plus the benefits are fantastic. (3 weeks vaca, 6% 401K match, 100% coverage of health care for me and ANY dependents, and more)  The best part is they have an open book style of management.  Every month all the employees from the secretary to the principal, get a spreadsheet showing how the company is doing fiscally, work productivity wise, and a bunch of other things and quarterly the whole company meets to discuss business decisions so we all have a say somewhat, which is amazingly refreshing in architecture, let alone in any company really.

The only reason I'm so nervous is because all of this sounds just too good.  Anyways, wish me luck...."

In my 4 plus years at TEA 2 I worked on a total of maybe 10 projects overall, really only 3 for any amount of time beyond a day or two of pinch hit help.  In my first week at Kuhl I've already got 4 under my belt.  I am the design department, the entire department, which is scary as hell, but a great chance for me at the same time. I also just managed to sell a client on doing a potential $200,000 face lift to his home's exterior with a 15 minute sketch and this could land us another 4g's when he gets around to the interior.  This is one of the reasons I wanted to get into architecture in the first place.  I may not end up going the architect route fully, but I'm doing what I like at least, for people who appreciate getting something well thought out for a decent price.  I have no crisis of conscious working here, yet at least.  It's still a ton of money to spend on a house, but more so its people that need an addition to house their growing family or have scraped enough together to help make their living arrangements nicer than some of the people who seemingly had way too much money for their own good at the old place.  Who knows maybe I'll run into that here, but the office culture is honest, its small, and I'm genuinely appreciated which feels great for once.  Just ask Rachel, I've had a bounce in my step this week that I haven't had since we first started dating.  I feel like I'm actually doing something decent..."

"event","Halfway decent night tonight.  I have a fun little story to tell about the Wild game.  It starts with yesterdays Swarm Lacrosse game where Wild Players Josh Harding, Dominic Moore and Derek Boogaard were signing autographs to raise money for breast cancer research.  So I have this towel that has a pictogram of a hockey ref bent over with his head up his butt that I had Boogaard sign since he's our tough guy and has the most penalty minutes on the team.  It's pretty sweet and he got a good chuckle out of it along with the other guys.  So today at the Wild game one of my buddy's from the swarm got picked as the Wild fan of the game and wanted to have the towel to put up on the screen when he's shown, so I loaned it to him.  I guess the tv guys nixed that saying they got in trouble from the screen time it got at the Swarm game the night before, but the Misson crew guy said he would take it to the locker room to see if he could get some more guys to sign it.  I actually thought at first it was made up and the guy was going to walk with it and that I'd never see it again.  But it did make it to the locker room between the 2nd and 3rd periods but didn't get signed since they're a bit busy in there.  Instead they had it taped up on the wall by the door out to the rink and everyone tapped it with their sticks on the way out to the rink for the 3rd.  As the mission crew guy grabbed it to bring back to my friend he's walking in the bowels of the X to the East elevator by where the refs lockers are and says a couple of them saw the towel as they were heading to the ice and just hung their heads and shook them as they walked by.  Funny stuff.  its hard to appreciate unless you see the thing.  I'll scan it in at work and probably make it one of my LJ icons in the near future.  I have no idea if its really true since its a story relayed to me through 2 people, so in all likelihood its probably not, but it'd be great if it was...  I'm happy enough to stupidly blindly believe it is."

Rachel's wallet was stolen yesterday morning from the Target in Roseville near Har-Mar and since she was on her way into work after stopping off she didn't notice she was pick-pocketed until after her big long afternoon meeting when the credit card companies started calling her.  Now we're cleaning up the pieces, canceling cards, getting a new Driver's License, the whole she-bang.  Its really quite fun I tell you, if you can sense my sarcasm in the written word.  Lucky for us, we're not out much money, just the change in her wallet and the money for a new license (which needed to be renewed in 2 months anyways) and the time off yesterday afternoon and all today.  Its just nuts I tell you.

Luckily her Social Security card wasn't in there and we're thinking that her most recent health and dental cards had updated user ids since the old ones were her social.  If I were you I'd check yours and drop them from your wallet if you don't need them daily.  We're also putting a stipulation on all our credit cards and ATM card to not allow singatureless point of sale transactions (like pay at the pump).  Its a bit of a hassle just to walk into the gas station, but anything under $10 is still okay so we can still use the parking ticket things in DT MPLS.  Also photocopy everything in your wallet from and back and file them somewhere safe because she had no clue how to cancel some of her store CC's.

They must've been stupid punk kids because they went straight to Champs shoes, JC Penny's and Marshall's besides 4 different tanks of gas all at Har Mar and the area around Rosedale.  If it were me I would've actually gone for something expensive at Best Buy or something...

Rachel's gone somewhat Kosher in her eating despite the fact we're not Jewish, so maybe I thought I'd oblige with the beer.  She won't eat any pork, but the whole mixing of dairy and red meat isn't an issue.  Mainly everything she's bought from the store recently with the exception of produce and my microwave meals is stamped with the circle K logo and Parve or Pareve, which, because I wanted to know, is all the neutral Kosher food that isn't made with Dairy or Meat products.  So apparently there are beers out there that use dairy or meat byproducts in them, which is news to me beyond a Chocolate Stout. .."

So recently I went out and applied for some different jobs to get myself out of here and I got the first one I applied for, though I wasn't quite sure if I would've really liked doing it I told my bosses I was going to leave which sent them into a panic and lo and behold I find myself 1 week later with a nearly 30% raise, 15% of which will be retroactive to JAN 1, 2006 and an actual job title.  I've been here four years without a job title.  I'm the only person with business cards without a title.  I've had this big gap for 4 years that can now be filled in with ""Project Captain.""  Ahoy there mateys!

Basically, since I've decided to put off my masters even longer now, I will soon be second in command on projects doing more Construction Admin, setting up the drawing packages for issues and directing the draftspeople, in addition to all the 3D modeling I do for the office, so its a pretty big move up.

Its not too shabby, about a half hr to hr of cleaning a day (run the lot and lawn for trash, wipe the fingerprints off the front entry, etc) for a $300/mo rent credit.  Which if I work about an hr a day doing it is like $10/hr tax free and I still get the full amount paid for my CRP, plus I do office hrs every other saturday and if the perso I give a showing leases from us I get a $50 bonus, and since I'm an employee we ca paint our apartments which will be my next big project.  There are only 17 units in the whole bldg so its now a ton of work and the leases work out that I'll have only 1 turnover this month, none next and maybe one month with 2 turns in the nextg 6 months.  Every turn I do is hourly rent credit (you know that $50/hr cleaning fee they charge you for above and beyond cleaning when you monve out I get $25/hr of that, but we give 2 hrs of cleaning away which I only get $9/hr for, but its all gravy, for very little shit, though I'm expecting osmething crappy to happen any day now.

Anyways still plodding away at TEA2 but only until I'm fully vested in my 401K at work in Nov and then I may whore myself out to a contract to hire drafting house just to get the hell out of here since good drafting jobs are hard to find right now."

"event","Ok so I got nudged to write a post? When did this feature come about.  I guess it has been awhile since I posted last... 

Seriously,  I know I don't write much of anything anymore, but not much is going on that I feel is even worthy of me sitting down and writing, plus it sucks not having internet at the new place yet because we have to wait for Comcast to have enough customers in our building want newer features to upgrade the box outside our bldg or some stupid thing like that.  At least we get Basic cable for $10/month yet, but I'm sure as soon as we get upgraded we'll have to pay $48/month for cable and another $45 for internet.

Its been a good week for once,  I actually could stand coming into work most of the week, but that's because I wasn't working on the project on Park Point most of the week.  I've been looking for a new job casually for the last month since it keeps getting worse here, and its getting to the point where its almost unbearable, so I think I'll start looking a bit more soon here.  My big dilemma is: I'm fully vested in my 401K if I stay until mid november, but if I leave before then, my employer matched money gets yanked from my account which is a good chunk of change, we're talking nearly $10K, so I think I'm sticking it out until then at least, despite the fact it sucks rhinoceros balls here.

My bank account is still trying to recover from the wedding which is another reason to leave, because I know I can make $4/hr more pretty much anywhere else I go and I've talked to them here about a raise many a time, but because Tom (my boss) is pretty much paying me my hourly rate out of his pocket and I'm not generating billable hours since I'm on his project so there's no chance of a raise until we're done with his house, which probably won't be until march at the earliest.  FUCK I've been on this litle 2700 sf house for 2.5 years already....

Anyways, at least the Wild start preseason action on tuesday so I'll have another source of stress relief available, and we're looking pretty good on paper this year...

Until I get nudged again... Auf Wiedersehen!"

"event","So I'm sitting in work on Saturday (as usual lately)  This time though I'm just trying to get up to 40 hours since I decided to ditch out early on Wednesday because ""I wasn't feeling well"" and since I finally went to the eye doctor on Friday after an almost 5 year hiatus.  Suprisingly my eyes hadn't changed all that much, but I was in desperate need of some new glasses.  I busted my old ones on the way down to Mississippi and they've been semi superglued together for the last 3 weeks.  So $400+ later I have new glasses.  Nothing exciting, Rachel vetoed the crazy architecture man glasses I initially wanted.This is good because they were over $100 more than the ones I ended up getting and I was already in sticker shock mode at how much my damn lenses were going to cost since I got the coating to reduce computer glare since I stare at these damn screens all day.  I popped a shitty pic in my user pic of the new specs, can't really see shit but whatever, I'm going home soon...

Work has been good lately.  Hopefully I'm off the principal's house in Duluth or at least half time on it because I really sick and tired of it right now.  I've been working on it for nearly 2 years straight now.  I've got a little side project doing some 3D modeling of a sauna/cottage thats going to be premanufactured at a timber shop in MN and be barged to its island in Canada.  Its kind of a neat little project and something good to put into my portfolio for grad school.

In other news, under 2 months until I'm married and I can slowly feel the stress ball getting bigger, but its not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  So far we seem like we'll have enough money for it all, but it'll be close.  The invites are going out next week, hopefully..."

I finally have my voice back again.  I damn nearly lost it on Saturday night at the Swarm game.  A miraculous come back from being down 2-9 with little more than 9 minutes left in the 3rd quarter to come back and win 10-9 is frickin' amazing and well worth losing the old voice for a few days.

I'm heading home to sconi tomorrow night through sunday for the NCAA frozen four and to see my ailing grandma in Chicago since I probably won't get another chance here for awhile.  I get the joy of going up to Duluth tomorrow for work too, so I 'll be spending around 9-10 hrs of my day in my car tomorrow and hopefully the rain will hold back since I have all but bald tires on my car.  This weekend to and from church I could feel myself hydroplaning in the drizzle.  I'm hurting for money bad with all the wedding stuff around and I'm probably going to have to buy them in pairs and spread out the purchase over the summer a bit.  Ah well, that's about all I've got for now though...."

"event","I've finally done it.  Made a crappy .gif animation of my car and the thundercats logo swapping back and forth.  Why?  because I can and because I've meant to do it ever since I bought the car back in 9/03 and thought that the side profile of the front fascia looked eerily like the Thundercats logo.  Only took 2 and a half years and half of my lunch break...

I got a bunch o'money for my B-day last week and I think I'm going to grab a new 60GB iPod for myself, but I've got to wait until my Discover card billing cycle ends on the 20th since Rachel's wedding ring is on this months...

Ah well time to go home and do my taxes.  Here's to hoping I get a nice refund..."

"event","So I don't know what possessed me to write tonight, let alone read LJ.  I haven't been online much at home mainly because I haven't been home much.  There have been a ton of hockey games as of late, and the Wedding plans and counseling sesssions are in full gear.  It'll be exactly 4 months from wednesday that me of all people will be walking down the aisle.  Still feels so wierd, but so right at the same time.

I've actually made good on my getting out more in the last month too.  I've relinked with a friend I made at New Student Weekend my freshman year of college and never saw again for 3 years until I was hanging out with Rachel and Andrea and he came over.  I only knew him as Welcome Matt then, and actually still did until maybe January of this year after we started hanging out again more and I finally found out his last name, and now he's in my wedding party.  Go figure eh?

I'm still plodding away at the firm and working on Tom's house up on Park Point in Duluth and its really coming together. Shell is done, and I'm cranking on lighting and control plans and finishing up interior framing.  Only took 2 years of my work to this point for a 2700sq ft house and it was being worked on a year prior to that.

I also may have a new side job doing promotions again.  I miss working for Drive in some ways, mainly the free concerts and just getting out more and meeting new people, but I'm definately not going back there.  I actually am trying to get set up with Surly Brewing Company, the twin cities newest brewery.  The brewmaster is married to the gal that runs the restaurant below my work and their beers are fricking phenomenal.  They're making their way all around the cities in bars and restaurants and you can check out where at http://www.surlybrewing.com   


You may be able to take me out of Wisconsin, but you can't take the beer lover out of me.

Anyways, I may just try to get some sleep tonight after all..."

""List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre, whether they have words, or even if they're any good, but they must be songs you're really enjoying now. Then tag seven other people to see what they're listening to.""

1. Silversun Pickups - ""Kissing Families"" -  Johnny Marr mixed with a little Modest Mouse if that makes any sense...

2. The Long Winters - ""Scent of Lime"" - Makes me feel like I'm floating in the clouds at first, just makes me feel relaxed, but really moving when you get to the chorus.  

3. Sean Nelson (of Harvey Danger) - ""What you Live by"" (Demo version not off the HD album)  -  For some reason I dig on the demo version better than the album verson with its stripped down almost western showdown drama evoking guitar in the beginning.

4. Pepe Deluxe - ""Real Simple"" - Has a sample of a recording of communications from the Sputnik 1 satellite, good flowing mellow rockage.

5. Phoenix - ""Run Run Run"" - Somewhat of a modern stripped down funk.  Weirdest thing is I like it even better just listening to the left channel due to how I have to wear my headphones at work when I've got to answer phones over the recpetionist's lunch hour, especially the chorus without the extra repetitive Neil Young solo picking...

6.  Mike Doughty - ""American Car"" - with a line like ""I want to run away and join the office"" after 3 lines of circus like lyrics its just fitting right now...

7. Ted Leo & the Pharmacists - ""The Angels Share"" - Just a good driving song for work...

I'm not tagging anyone, but if you want to do it, shoot"

"event","... kicked my ass.  Matty and I headed up to DC to hang out with Chris and Dave and see an awesome rock n roll show.  We started out with a nappy nap in the hotel room followed by dinner and drinks with Dave at the Dubliner.  Don't know what happened to Chris, but Matt still thinks he's an imaginary friend.  Anyway, the food was great and the cider was flowing.

We headed to the Black Cat with all intents to get smashed and to rock out.  In all actuality, i rocked out so hard, the drunk just drained right out of me.  

The first band, Nebula, was good.  very slow stoner rock kinda like Fu Manchu.  Later we found out some of Nebula was actually IN Fu Manchu.  They were a bit boring, but i was just excited to see The Datsuns.

The Datsuns ROCKED MY LIFE!!!  I danced so hard that I literally gave myself whiplash.  I just couldn't help it... the set was so good i couldn't hold back.  They played some amazing songs and and ""Mofo From Hell"" was BAD ASSSSSS! I couldn't believe how good this band sounded.  It was the first time a band almost brought me to tears.  Tears of joy of course.  I met some awesome metal heads up front and they let me hang with them right at the stage.  

 The Hellacopters rocked some awesome songs including ""By the Grace of God"", ""Everything is on TV"" and ""No Angel to Lay me Down"".    The Hellacopters put on a rockin' set, but nothing could compare to The Datsuns.... until the encore.

9 guitarists, a guest singer and a classic rock n roll song = musical orgasm.  Every guitar player from all the bands that night got up on stage and did the most rockin' version of MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"" i have EVER seen.  It was so fuckin' loud and there was so much going on... it was like sensory overload.  I couldn't help but throw up the horns.  

Shopping the next day was great, the trip home was a bit sucky due to my over dancing.  I hurt everywhere today.  I had to visit the Chiropractor.  I learned a valuable lesson, i'm 30... i can't rock out like that anymore. It was worth it for the best show i've ever seen."

"event","Well it's that time of year again.  Time for the short stretch to march, which acording to me, is the beginning of warmer days. I need spring to be here, I'm sick of sweaters.  I anxiously await Punxatony Phil's forecast for the next six weeks.  It dosen't really matter because this winter has been a breeze.  Maybe it's just the many years that have made me get used to the cold, or maybe it's global warming.  I chose the latter.  Speaking of many years...

Time for another year of life to begin.  Unfortunately this time I'm hitting a milestone.  It dosen't feel good.  Why is turning 30 so hard?  To me it's a loss of youth.  I'm not supposed to be 30 right now.  I'm still out there having fun and meeting new people and just being youthful.  But then, I have done alot of things in the past 3 years that I would imagine an adult would do.  I've gotten married, bought a house, re-financed the house, finished college and paid off my car.  That's alot of adult things to do in 3 years time!!  I just don't want to get complacent.  I don't want to feel old, and I definately don't want to look old.  From now on I'll make sure to pile on the SPF 25 face cream and get a microdermabrasion atleast once every 3 months.  I don't feel 30, why should I look it?  This is so much harder than I thought it would be.  Speaking of hard....

Time for a sexual uprising! The one good thing about turning 30 is hitting my prime! It's awesome.  It's as if I've embarked on a journey to find my true sexual identity.  The trip should be fun, but I won't bring you a souvenir. ;)

Hopefully I'll update my blog more often.  I love writing and I miss it so much.  Thanks to Chris for his great blogs and encouragement for me to start doing mine again."

"event","It's been awhile since I've had a bunch of girlfriends to hang with.  Now I almost have an overabundance.  We meet and have martinis.  We meet and watch sexy movies with hot men we love.  We meet and have a Roman feast and watch HBO on Sunday Nights.  I love it!  How could I have ever gone without them!

My girlfriends have really helped me in so many ways.  They helped me out of a rut.  A rut that I could have stayed in forever.  A rut that, even though myself and one other knew what was going on (no it's not what you're thinking), would have ultimately destroyed everything that I hold dear to me.  My love for my husband, my relationship with my best friend, and all my other friends.  And in the middle of all this turmoil were the girls... helping me without knowing it.  

Another thing they helped me with was opening my eyes to new things.  Helping me get over myself and showing me that it's ok to love myself.  HA!  My relationship with my husband has never been stronger.  Thanks to me opening up and my girlfriends for encouraging it.

I love you girls and I hope we are friends forever!  Thursdays won't be the same now that I have you!

<3

"event","Working for the Bishop is usually fun.  I get up at 7:30 and do my usual moring routine. I leave the house at 8am and rock out hard all the way to Salem.  At 8:30 I actually begin my day.  Well... that is if i make it to work on time.  I work for a full 6 hours and leave feeling happy to have this wonderful job.

But this week... ohhh this week is different.  This is the one week a year that I work 7 days straight with no time off.  It's ok because it'll be over.  It'll be over and i wont have to do this gain for another year.  I wouldn't mind it so much if we were busy, but we're not.  I get paid to sit on my ass and wait for someone to come in and ask me to make 7 copies of this or staple 3 copies of that.  super-duper boring.  I can't even think of what to do on-line so I decided to start this live journal, just to have something to do.

It worked.  Only a half hour left until we may (or may not) be able to leave.

la-de-da."

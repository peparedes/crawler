Besides, a purple sky is better soaring
for you my angel 
You're an angel, you little devil
As for me i'll stay inside, I'll be just fine 
and I'll watch from the window 

Cannot categorize the nature of this sickness 
A miracle that you're alive 
Stuck to the roof of my mouth with a staple
Remember last April when we saw US Maple? 
Somehow the singer showed the Fireside
exactly how I feel 

And we say goodbye and go underground 
Or up towards the sky 
Up in smoke burnt down to size 
At least we're still friends, at least we're still alive 

Take your wings outside, no use for them in here 
Bad luck to open inside, work like umbrellas
Like a broken mirror, it's getting clearer
The end is closer than ever before 
And you'll want nothing more
When your head hits the floor 
And you're lost in the darkness 
And we say goodbye and go underground 
Or up towards the sky 
Up in smoke burnt down to size 
At least we're still friends, at least we're still alive 

And we say goodbye and go underground 
Or up towards the sky 
Up in smoke burnt down to size 
At least we're still friends, at least we're still alive"

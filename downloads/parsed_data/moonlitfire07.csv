It's amazing. and has such a great message to it.

Anywho, this semester has officially started.
And it is a crazy one.
I have 6 ensembles...yes, 6. I do not jest. 
Wind ensemble. Jazz Combo. Jazz Ensemble. Flute Quartet. Praise Band. and now Handbell Choir.
2 private lessons.
Flute. Saxophone.
And several regular classes.
Music Theory 2. Foundations of Education. Music in the Elementary School. Fundamentals of Oral Communication. Field Experience.
And work study.

So, yes. I don't know what the meaning of ""breathe"" is until Thursday comes along...then Monday it all starts over again.

On another note, I'm perfectly content with how everything is going in life.
I am single, but I'm fine with it. The person I like knows how I feel, and that's all there is to it.
If he decides he does want to see what's there, then great.
If not, then life goes on.
In the meantime, I am on a list...a list of girls one guy plans to marry. haha.
This is the kind of fun we have in Cline.
You know you enjoy every minute of it.
At least I do.

On yet another note, I had my first run-in with the Pfeiffer Sniper. 
I was walking with Joey back to Cline after our Fundamentals of Oral Communications class, and he tries to point out a car to me. So, I turn to look, and I guess I stepped off the sidewalk wrong, and I ended up flat on my back. I was laughing so much by the time he seemed to realize what happened. haha. So, yeah, he and some other girl who had just seen me fall helped me up (that girl just shows that there are good samaritans around), and then he points at the car again, and yells ""don't fall"" when I look. So, yeah, I ended up with a sprained ankle and a skinned knee. The knee is worse off...I still need to really wash it out. :-\ no. fun. Needless to say, when he came into the room to talk to me last night, he definitely gave me orders to stay off the ankle and to not fall again. haha. My brother looks out for me. :-)

Now, I'm going to get going. It's midnight and I have a 9:00 meeting in the morning. Yay for Pfeiffer Pfollies. :-)
Good night!"

"event","<p>My first semester in college...<em>over</em>.<br />It doesn't feel like it's already come and gone.<br />This semester FLEW by.<br />I hate to think of how the next 3 and a half years are gonna be.<br /><br />But this semester was amazing. Of course, there were rumors and drama and all that stuff that's associated with life, but, it always gives life that extra spin it needs to keep you on your toes.<br /><br />The rumors? Yeah, never said anything about those, did I? Well, let's just keep it at: people were assuming something was going on when, in all actuality, it wasn't.<br /><br />Drama? Oh, come on. I live with 35 - 40 other people. DON'T try to say there can't be drama there.<br /><br />I love my major. I know, without a doubt, that music is where I'm supposed to take my life. It's only a question of how I'm supposed to use that music to live. There's something in me that wants to teach, but at the same time, there's something in me that wants to perform. I love performing. It's during performances that I feel like I'm where I need to be, that I'm doing what I'm meant to do. Everything just goes away except for the music. I get so into the music, I forget where I am, how I look playing, or if people are staring or not. None of that matters. All that matters is the music. I want to have that feeling for as long as I can. Right now, I would be ecstatic to be a jazz flautist. I had never considered that until this past semester, bu thanks to Mr. Kiefer and Dr. Kirby, that really sounds like something I would love to spend my life doing. It's just so freeing playing whatever comes to the top of your head. It doesn't matter if it always sounds perfect; no one has perfect solos each time they improv. So that really takes off pressure. It's the fact that you're up there, giving it all you've got, and actually have guts to get up there and do that stuff. Not everyone can do that. I can. And I want to continue doing that.<br /><br />On another note. Crush? Yeah, that's still there. We actually dated this past semester. For all of 4 days. haha. By far, the shortest ""relationship"" I've had. Thing is, I really don't see it as a relationship. Don't get me wrong, I was definitely happy during those 4 days. I don't know what happened. But honestly, as long as that friendship is still intact, that's all that matters to me. I values his friendship far too much to want to develop anything that will destroy that friendship.<br /><br />Oh, I never said anything about him. Well, he's a freshman at Pfeiffer. Also lives in Cline. Christian Ed/Youth Ministries major. Youth pastor at a Methodist church.&nbsp;A few months younger than me (but hey, what else is new?). And absolutely the sweetest guy I have ever met.<br />I told one of my best friends about him when I got home for Christmas. She wanted to kill him, saying that he ""broke my heart."" We definitely weren't together long enough for that to have happened. But, I got him some brownie points by just saying some of the little things he does. Like, the last thing he wrote on our mirror, because I was in a bad mood and he wanted me to cheer up, ""Wake up beautiful, it's an amazing day!"" And the day we started ""dating"" I wasn't really eating for some reason. I was really shaky and couldn't eat much at all. Went to the caf with him, but only got a drink, hoping it would help a little. He kept on getting onto me because I wasn't eating, and finally persuaded me to eat some soup. I started getting up to go get it, and he wouldn't let me. He made me sit down while he went to get it.<br />Those were quite possibly two of the absolute sweetest things anyone had ever done for me. Aside from his trying to help me with whatever was wrong with me before we started ""dating"" and staying up with me until 2:30 - 3:00 in the morning, just trying to get me to calm down and get out everything.&nbsp;<br />But the sweetest thing was: he prayed with me. He sat beside me, took my hands, and prayed. Some people just don't get how I see that as the sweetest thing, but believe me. It was.&nbsp;<br /><br />I seem to take the little things in life for granted. We all do. From now on, no more of that. I will keep my priorities in order, but still have fun and enjoy and conquer whatever life happens to throw my way.</p>"

"event","So, life at PU is amazing. I love it more and more each day I'm here.
Well, to get you up to speed:
1) Went with Dr. Kirby to Mt. Airy, and loved it! For one thing, there's so much I can learn from him, and I'm definitely glad he's at Pfeiffer now. And two: SOUTH DOMINATED!! first place, baby! WOOOOT! Ok, my excitement's done. Kirby definitely laughed at me for my excitement on that. Oh, well. He'll be laughing at me a looot over the next few years.
2) I'm apparently a part of a ""legacy"" now. I play jazz flute in our jazz band, and according to Kiefer and Kirby, my solo has made me a part of a legacy. ""People are going to be talking about that solo 40 years from now. You're going to come back here for Homecoming and peope will say 'You remember her solo?' You're part of a legacy now."" -D.K.
3) Treasurer for MENC. Heck yes.
4) Had our first official concert(s) for wind ensemble...could've been better, but could've been a looot worse.
5) Helped out at the Asheboro Zoo for a service project. Long day, but it was fun and definitely worth the pain we were in afterwards.
6) Talked to Dr. Kirby about taking an extra sax lesson next semester. And I can. YAY. What better person to take a lesson from?
7) We're starting up a new jazz combo. The current one is 2 trumpets, piano, trombone, bass, guitar, and drums. The new one is going to be bass, guitar, saxophone, saxophone/flute, and probably a couple others. Betcha can't guess who's the saxophone/flute player?? ;-)
8) Went to my first MENC convention last night and today. It was AMAZING. There's no way to explain why it was amazing...you have to be a band geek to understand. hahaha. no offense or anything, but if you're not really into band stuff, then you really wouldn't get why I was so amazed. What normal person would be thrilled about clinics and lectures and concerts and exhibits??? I WOULD.
9) And the crush? Yeah, I'll tell more on that when I figure out what's going on with that....it's more complicated than it was....it needs some sleeping on.
Which is what I'll do now.
I'll eventually post more elaborately on this thing.
I promise. :-P
Just help me remember I have it."

"event","<p>Ok, so, I keep forgetting about this site. It just gets confusing after a while. Too many sites! Ahh!! hahaha.<br />Ok, so anywho. I'm now a freshman at Pfeiffer. And I absolutely LOVE IT! I couldn't imagine being anywhere else. It's amazing. I've met some incredible people here, and I've definitely got my own little crush. haha. Soo, update from the end of July:<br />1) Played at Amity Lutheran the Sunday before move-in at Pfeiffer...and went the longest I had ever gone without going to my church. But, hey...I got paid. lol.<br />2) Move-in day was August 16 (or 17 or something like that). I cried. For about 20 minutes. As soon as I made a friend, I was good. hahaha.<br />3) Taking 11 classes...one of which all I have to do is sit there during recitals...unless I have to play. eek.&nbsp;<br />4) Only taking 2 classes that aren't music related.<br />5) Doing better in Writing than I thought<br />6) Doing WORSE in Spanish than I thought. hah.<br />7) Basically, the people here at PU are, in one word: incredible<br />8) Playing jazz flute in jazz band. And it's accepted here. hahaha.<br />9) Improv on the flute = sooo much better than on the sax. :-P<br />10) The crush = amazing. no other words to describe him.<br /><br />So, things are going amazingly well. I love it. I get to go with Kiefer to Iredell County next Thursday to visit North, South, and Statesville High Schools...I guess I'll be helping with recruiting...? eh, who knows. Then, on the 20, I get to go with Dr. Kirby to Mt. Airy for the marching band competition and sit in the judges box...I'm super excited for that. Gah, I'm so glad I decided to come here. Things are fantastic. :-)</p>"

"event","<p>Ok, so, a LOT has happened since I last posted...haha...well, at least I should hope so, seeing as how it's been almost a year and a half.<br />So, how's about a nice little list on what's been going on in the life of me. lol.<br />1) Leslie and I broke up...actually, it'll be a year since we broke up come next month. Wow, time flies. haha.<br />2) Huge falling out between me and him, but everything turned out peachy keen.<br />3) I had so many memories from this past year, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't change anything that happened. For example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **""Dude looks like a lady!"" ""Blueballs"" ""Does anyone have any nuts down there?"" and the Mountaineer football playin' waterbottles...all from the ASU football game back in, like, November.<br />4) I ended up dropping community band...felt kinda awkward going anymore.<br />5) was in James and the Giant Peach, playing a double role of James' mother, and the Glowworm.<br />6) Zach = my hero. I adore this kid, and I miss him so much. (he's off at another school in Raleigh)<br />7) Built a dragon over 10 foot tall, and had an immense blast doing so. (John and Ashley were the best teammates I could've had on that project)<br />8) All that can be said to this is: Team Hambilly totally kicks ass! haha. (our own rendition of Hamlet, hillbilly style. :-P)<br />9) Let's just say AP English IV was the best class ever. Period.<br />10) I started seeing something for what it really could be...<br />11) I straight up told David that I like him, and got a humiliating response of ""oh""...haha. I just have the best luck.<br />12) David and Caroline = my favorite kids of all time.<br />13) The Lady Pirates of Captain Bree = the best production ever! I've never been in a production that has went so smoothly.<br />14) Transition will forever hold my heart. Zach, Matt, Tristan and Tyler and my favorite rockstars ever.<br />15) By the way, Transition was our talent show group that I was the singer in, which also won 1st place in the talent show!<br />16) our celebration for winning the show: spending our 8 bucks each to watch Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End (amazing, by the way)<br />17) South Iredell graduate of 2007 :-D<br />18) I couldn't have had a better person to sing with at graduation: Amanda, ""You Raise Me Up"" with you sounded beautiful!<br />19) Kitty Hawk was my first official vacation/beach trip, and it was the greatest week EVER! It went by faaar too fast.<br />20) Pfeiffer University, class of 2011, here I come! :-)<br /><br />And for now, that sounds good. So, I'll leave for the night, maybe update again within the next year...hahaha. Ta!</p>"

"event","well, this is officially the longest I have ever gone without updating something. lol. Oh, well...that's ok. Anywho, not too awfully much has been going on the past...well, year..ok, that was a lie. Quite a bit has happened..I just can't remember it all. So, I'll just highlight:
1) Spring production turned out fabulously...we just didn't raise a whole lot of money for it, which wasn't unexpected.
2) graduation was sad...I'm gonna miss Shalondo, Erin, Nathan, Crystal...all of them.
3) Marching band was..well, interesting this year..definitely different.
4) SIHS Football made it to the playoffs...then lost in the first game.
5) went to WCU on Sept. 24 with Leslie and his family, and had a total blast! The day ended with me and Les going back out...we're still going out, too...almost 4 months! :-D
6) joined community band at Mitchell Community college...it's a lot of fun. I definitely enjoy it.
6) Made all county..4th chair...got the clinic in 2 weeks! (yayness)
7) All-District auditions tomorrow..fun, fun? we'll see...

Yep, that was a very short update...but, I will update more often..promise! lol. Toodles for now!

Anywho, if you don't feel like looking at the profile, my name is Kerri, I'm almost 16, and I'm a huge music/acting person. I play flute, piccolo, and alto sax in band. I'm sorta-kinda in our school's spring production; I have to put up with the director (Mr. Cutlip, who is one of the bestest teachers ever!) by sitting beside him everyday at practice, and bugging him before/after school with the nazi (oh, and I'm also the nazi lover, according to Mr. C.). I'm the student director, stage manager (I think...he said something about that, so....), and Mr. Cutlip's right/left arm. It's actually really fun...anyone in the South Iredell area should see the play on April 29 and 30 at 7:00 in the SIHS Auditorium! Donations are welcome...

Wow, I""m jsut rambling about our production, so, I'm gonna go. Let me know if there's more you wanna know about me!"

"event","It feels good to let it be known that I'm not picking up a single finger this weekend to help them clean the house for a baby shower that they didn't even ASK 2 out of the 4 roommates if it was okay to have here at our SHARED house.
I have 0 dishes in the kitchen.  I always pick up after myself, and I've been putting up with their SHIT all year.  Slobs they are.  So yeah.
Today on my day off, I took out the recycling, and threw out some garbage, and made plans to get my futon and bike out of their way for the shower....they are PATHETIC.  Ugh.  
I had to go the the music dept. to get ready to record a concert today, and when I sat down in the music lounge for a few minutes, all people were talking about was drinking, music stuff (that I've already been there WAY more than them awhile back) in a very immature way.  
All that keeps prevailing through my mind is ""love not hate...love not hate...love not hate.""  It's so hard to let some things go.

I'm at the stage right now, where I have to live here and work my jobs for a month and a half yet, but my BRAIN has already LEFT the premises!!!!!  My brain is already in Michigan, sitting down by the water, listening to the beautiful, hypnotic wind chimes....
I can't wait to see people I like."

-that my grandma went into surgery.
-that my psychiatrist appointment was shitty.  I don't like this guy at ALL.  I like my psychologist though.  Long story short.  Trying to pinpoint my MAJOR mood shifts and behavior I've delt with for a long time.  I've realized on my own that I think the chronic pain I experience daily is the culprit.  So now?  Time to go to a rheumatologist.  Need to be put on something and figure out what's going on with my body.  It's taken me years to be able to admit there's something wrong at all....givin' that my mom is has seemed hypochondriatic my entire life... but then again, I think it is partly true... though she does play up for sympathy.  Anyway, it's about time I do my part to figure this all out so I can feel normal.  It's been since early January when I started this whole process.  I hope I can at least be diagnosed before leaving to Michigan.  My guess?  Fibromayalgia.
-that my car overheats AGAIN on the way home today.  Luckily I made it to the car place again and he did a quick fix and seemed to fix the prob.  No charge.  My car was burping up air bubbles more or less.
-that I have a long list of things that need to be done and all i can think about is sleeping.
-Only 29 days left of my job.
-Only a month and a half until Michigan for the summer!!! :)

(once they approached me and asked if i smoked)  Ugh....  I am SOOO deadened by the realization of peer pressure when it comes to smoking.  I tried to tell my own personal stories in a roundabout way.  I just hope that maybe in a little glimpse, there was a shed of light.  It saddens me so.  Before they came, I did get about 10 min. alone at the park.  I fell a few times....I still can't seem to keep momentum when just rocking in the middle of the 1/2 pipe.  Any ideas?  I try to push off each time, but eventually I slow down.  Hm.  Anyway, I'm still not ready to drop in until I can master that, and also go down a steep hill with no fear and successfully.  I can handle small hills for now.  Also, my kickturns are shaping up better.  Still haven't gotten a solid ollie yet though....I can do it WAY better on my scooter!

Today, I went to Como Park in St.Paul and met up with a few people, only to shortly thereafter go skateboarding/scooting with Dani all over the park.  We had a heart to heart talk in the car later in the day and the rest of the day was pretty kosher.  We had a great dinner.... involving spinach spaghetti, avocado, sauted (spelling?) onions and garlic, and some roasted asparagus on top along with fresh parmesean.  Tis yummmmmy.
We also went to a Bar in River Falls to check out a jazz jam session.  The smoke and my allergies were really bothering me though, so I didn't stick around to play in the 2nd set.

I got to see my friend Jen whom I usually only see once or twice a year.  I've known her now for about 10 years.  One of those really close friends you just pick up where you left off with.  She's great.  So, I got to see her while we chilled on the sidewalk outside of a Caribou Coffeee while I ate my subway sandwich on my skateboard, and she laid on her back soaking up the sun.  The weather was BEAUTIFUL today.
Once I got home, I went STRAIGHT to Dani's to pick her up so we could go scootering all around.  We went all over the place and got a good work out.  I managed to get a lot of air with my scoot.  At least a foot high off the ground.  After all that, we ran to the grocery store to pick up some pesto and an avacodo to eat with pasta and a calzone.  After we ate we went back outside to skateboard/scoot a bit more and then called the outside fun a night.  Yum.  I love days outside like this....especially sharing them with people you really dig.
And tomorrow is friday.  I do believe that Dani and I are actually going to go to a Queer Club in Minneapolis and get our groove on.  Odd thing for both of us...
Okay, sleeeeeepy kaylynn needs her bed.

We went on a search for a skateboarding helmet (i bought a bob burnquist pro tec model), and took out time meandering through the stores we stopped at.  We then stopped at a grocery store and picked up some cheddar macaroni salad and orange cream soda for dinner to eat in her car.  THEN, we went a few doors down to a Petsmart, and stared in awe at the nice cat available in the adoption center.  I wanted to take him home so bad.  Hmm... then, we went to Borders and sat down and read for a couple of hrs.  I bought a magazine ""The Thinking Woman's Magazine,"" and a another skateboarding book!  After we got home, we thought about going out to get a drink...so, we stopped off at Emma's, a local bar, we walked in...and walked out.  Nope.  Not comfortable, too smoky, and not an environment I wanted to be in.  Every once and awhile, it's like I test myself on my desire to drink or be in such an environment.  Every time it's proven to be something I'd rather avoid.  I'm fine by that.
Dani just left to go home so we chill on our own for a bit today.  This morning, we watched ""Dogtown and Z-boys"" which is a skateboarding/surfing development documentary movie.  Very very good.
Going to shower, practice trumpet, read, and then who knows.  Maybe do some job searching for fall again or work on resume.

Today, went to the skatepark again, and the half pipe felt a little more smooth and familiar,...getting used to the feeling.  Still need more momentum to keep going back and forth.... it's hard when you don't drop in, and just practice on the base floor of the pipe.
Somehow, it got MO FO cold here in MN/WI.  UGH.  I'm excited for TRUE spring weather to hit.
Work is...well....fine.  It's work...I enjoy my job, while I'm there, and I'm happy not to think about it too much when I come home.  All and all.... it's rewarding on some level.  I'm glad I've had this experience because I'm thinkin' of applying to Americorps in Chicago/Minneapolis and there are jobs that I may be more qualified for because of my current job, and past experience.
Just paid off my credit card...boy does THAT feel nice.
..hmm...what else?  Just finished reading Tony Hawk's Bio. Book.  That was yummy.  Now, I'm readin' ""Art and Lies"" by Jeanette Winterson  (it's totally wacky and not an easy read)
Umm...
I've been practicin' trumpet on a more serious note for the last few days.  I've decided no more half assing.... I'm gonna work hard because it feels good to improve.

We laugh to tears again and again and again... yet, though our religious perspectives are both strong, and different in some ways, we are still very close.  We try to understand one another and always make more than a normal effort to listen and comprehend each other's thoughts.

Tonight, I'm going to read, go grocery shopping, practice trumpet a bit, perhaps do some recycling since our bins are overflowing downstairs....who knows.  All the mean while,...I feel as though I have everything and nothing to say.  Life just is for now. :)"

I went to college for 6 years, and lived alone in a big city, and have lived ""real life"" so to speak outside of school for about one year.  There is no reason for me to get mad.  Nor, to hold grudges on any one person or any one situation.  It's just part of life.  I cannot get upset at the natural way of humans and their progression.  So ""good-bye"" to the thing and people I held onto when I clearly see now I need to let go.

Sinus stuff combined with some type of cold I think.  Anyway, tonight, Dani and I watched ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" (and had lots of fun doing...uh, other stuff) on vhs.  That was a pretty good movie, I enjoyed it.  Hmmm....  Ah yes, we also managed to drag our butts to the mega mall on Saturday evening, in which we both came home with a few useful things... like new winter jackets that are actually WARM, clothes on sale, and the highlight was that she got a rainbow bright doll, and cookie monster tshirt, and i got a Razor Scooter that has shocks and lights.  I am SO excited to ride scooters with Dani!  I'm so excited to do many things with Dani for that matter.  She appears to be sleeping on her bed.  I'm gonna go cuddle with her now, and hopefully rest a bit better than I have been tonight.
AH, tomorrow, Dani and I both have OFF from work.  How cool."

"event","When I'm at work, (2 different high schools), I am working with ESL (English as a Second Language) students ranging greatly in their ability or lack there of of understanding the verbal, and written language of English.  My job?  I am an Education Assistant in a ""ESL Workshop"" class, in which students come everyday to get help with their homework which as you know, can vary greatly in high school.  We work uber hard to build their confidence *a lot of them think they are stupid because they don't understand there assignments*.  We also hope to make a good person for them to confide in, to ask for help in many situations.  And trust me, with their often controversial ethnic/american upbringings, they have their issues.
[stops to eat some mac and cheese with alpha sprouts]
SO, I cannot tell you how interesting difficult it has been throughout this school year to deal with their verbal use of the word ""Gay"" in class.  ""Oh man, that's so GAY,"" or ""Man, this is assignment sucks man,,...it's so GAY,"" or ""Man, he's so GAY man...""  You get the idea.
When dealing with the many different cultures *whom all have very different cultural upbringings, many of which have been in the U.S. for different amounts of time (""Fresh off the Boat"" is a term they use for newbies)...it can be hard to explain what an American ""Stereotype"" is, or what it means to call something ""Gay"" *meaning STUPID in their voice inflections and mannerisms*.  
Some of them I am sure do not know at all what being GAY actually means.  And others, well, they more than laugh under their breathe.  There awkwardness when confronted with the usage of the word leaves them feeling often having to react homophobically,...because of course, they wouldn't want their peers to think for one second that THEY could be gay.  What would their culturally diverse peers think?  
I am not out to my students.  To some faculty, I am more than out.  But I feel inhibited, and sorry for the lack of understanding that not just americans have, but that our countries future workers/citizens have.
It's interesting.
That's all for now.
Work is an every day enlightenment, and a challenge in numerous ways.
Peace.
Btw, I've tried a few different routes on explaining the offensive means of using the term ""Gay"" negatively... any suggestions , and I'm all ears!!!
The students I have are:
Somali, Hmong, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Chinese, and a couple of different African cultures"

"event","Dani went off 3 interstate lanes and slid into a ditch this morning...backwards.  Someone cut in front of her and she hit black ice or something.  No cops would stop for her.  But, some nice guy pulled over and let her use his cell phone, and then, another nice guy with a big truck pulled her car out and she continued to drive to work, shaken up of course.  The car was within inches of a pole that she thought for sure she would hit with her new car, but she did not hit it.  She hit no other car jutting across 3 lanes, and she has no scratches to herself even.  She is lucky.  I am lucky.  Okay, now, it's time for me to follow the same roads to work (we work right by one another....her at an elem. school, me at a high school)....  I'm very glad she is alright.

High schoolers high on life, and younger ones playing in the dirt, making trails for the ants and trapping food for spiders.  Sweating on bed sheets.  Cuddling by a beach fire.  Loud, concert music a footballs distance away...Jewel, Ani, and some not so great artists...heehee.  A place I love to be.  A place I feel loved.  I place that I love others.

She also told me that my STD check was negative.  So more good news.  And then, she told me that when they were looking at my kidney's/bladder, they found a cist on one of my ovaries.  So, I need to go back in for a pelvic ultrasound.  Also, need to go in for more bloodwork to test for hyperthyroid.

Today, Dani and I are going to the cities to do whatever.  I think we're going to a gay friendly coffee shop, and bookstore, and wherever else we feel inclined to go.  I need to find a bday present for mom.
Tomorrow, there is a cool show with 4 very well known trombone players playing at the AQ (Artist's Quarter) in St.Paul, so I might go see that show in the afternoon.

Hmm...

A couple of nights ago Dani and I searched Humane Societies all over MN and elsewhere for the perfect 'cat.'  We must have spent at least 3 hrs. doing so.  I've never laughed so hard in a long time... They are sooo awesome.  I'm super excited for the day I finally get to be a mom for a cat and dog.  *sigh* :)
~~
Dani bought SIMS Deluxe a few days ago, so we've managed to dwindle some time away having fun with that.  Excellent tool to relax and have fun!!!  In the first game, Dani's character lit herself on fire and the grim reaper came for her and everything jumping up and down!!! It was unbelievable!  So, needless to say, we started over from the beginning of our saved game.
~~
Trumpet is: well, interesting.  My parents seemed to have been so enthralled with my last solo concert that they are talking about BUYING me a flugel?!?!!!!  I didn't even ask for it.  
~~
A few days ago, my mom broke 2 ribs.  She got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and apparently my overtired dad accidentally left his robe on the bathroom floor *our floors are already slippery enough...my mom pledges them all way too much*, and so..... my mom slippsed and came crashing down and hit the toilet.  She is darn lucky to be alive.  It could have been much worse.  My Dad gave me a good scare though... when he called to tell me, he was crying so hard i could hardly understand him *keep in mind, I've heard my dad cry only twice in my life...the other time is when we lost our dog a few years ago*.... All he could say is ""Your mom....she's hurt.""  I thought for a moment that the situation was much worse than it was/is.  I'm so happy she will heal.  Now if my mom could just be a bit more optimistic.... 
~~
Right now, it's snowing very hard.  Dani is skipping her choir rehearsa in Minneapolisl tonight I thinik because of it.  The roads are not good.  The city roads will be okay,...but around 10pm coming home on little H35 won't be so great. 
~~
This morning, I had an Ultrasound for my kidneys, and the cists on them.  I don't really know anything about it yet, because my doctorish person was this Russian lady whom really seemed to have no sense of humor, and she was pretty rude to me.  Very odd.
~~
Work has been...work.  Always new, every day.  Currently, I'm looking into a couple of things... possibly getting a MLS degree *Master of LIbrary Science*, and or working for a postal office.  My other pull is with Science of Mind, but I don't know how to make a living while doing that.  Hum.
~~
Feels like there is more to say, but I'm drawing a blank. 
~~
Right now, I have a big picture of a one-eyed kitty named ""Road-Runner"" on my desktop.  He's adorable.  
~~
I'm hoping to move rooms in this house in about 10 days.

Also, need to get muscle relaxant prescription filled.  Dani said I was grinding so hard and clenching my fists so tight last night in my sleep that I was shaking.  Thank goodness for my bite plate now.  
So, within a couple of days, I may not have ANY internet.  For the next 4 mo.'s, I may have to use the library/dani's computer.  Email will not be as reliable as a source to contact me anymore.  All this is because of a roommate moving out with little notice... I now have nobody to split the bill with.  Ah well.  I'll make do I guess.  Probably will practice more and read more, which could be cool.
Today after work, I'm going to stop at my parents house and dig through kid pictures so I can show Dani later.  I don't know if I have my baby book anymore... it's either buried in some box in the garage, or it got lost in the move in '97.

Got new glasses, so that's exciting.
I may have an overactive thyroid, but all other results on physical /pap came back normal.
I'm gonna be late for work if I don't leave....
Last night, I spent time assorting finances and bills for a couple of hrs.... whew.
Went to burger king to get hot choco by myself to fill out some job paperwork, and read SOMind and take some of the thoughts down in my journal.
Trying very hard to just say.... ""what is just is.... let it go.""

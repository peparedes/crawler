today i went to my first youth group with aaron, schnell and jeff. it was pretty cool, i think im going to go again sometime.

i canceled my audition for the art academy- there was to much pressure, then today ms brinck pulls me aside and told me she would have let me in. that made me not too happy, because i had already started a huge self portrait and spent about 120$ in total for supplies just this.

i wish i were taking photography right now. i took some amazing pictures at the barn show on sat. me and dan could not decide which should go on the site, theres 122 total.

""Perfect""

This time I think it could be perfect
But you're pushing away
I came here today with a purpose
Should I try or just let it go?
'cause these things I'd like to ask you
Are things I can't explain
Or should I keep your plans outside the porch last Saturday?

Should I have succumbed to your courtesy?
I could see you were trying to get my attention
But I pushed it away

This time I think it could be perfect
But you're pushing away
This time I think it could be perfect
But you're pushing away

But tonight it seemed suddenly perfect
Still no promises made
The balance of power has shifted
Were you trying to let me in?
Or was I trying so hard
That all of my confidence was lost tonight?
Confused and regretful, I cracked
Swallowed it back, and left with no spine intact

Should I have succumbed to your courtesy?
I could see you were trying to get my attention
But I pushed it away

This time I think it could be perfect
But you're pushing away

Maybe we were meant
To see what's right
She held a sort of it
Just a taste of life
To see what's right
To make sense out of it

What a shame that we're slipping away now (away now)
Going away now
To see what's out there
'cause you're all that's here for me

This time I think it could be perfect
But you're pushing away
This time I think it could be perfect
You're all that's here for me

finch is a great band. vanilla coke isnt so great. i miss her, a lot, but i get to see her soon.
---i went to the movies on friday night. sat w/ emily, brant, adam, john, and rich. the movie's storyline sucked, but they showed a lot of drumming, so it evened out. i think i pissed off brant, because at steak-n-shake, i guess i looked sad because he aske if i was ok. i didnt really answer, i said ""i'll pretend i am"" so hes rying to get it outta me. im like ""ITS ONLY HAPPENED 4-5 TIMES IN THE LAST 13 MONTHS!!"" ithink he got it. but he did say, "" laura, you said we were cool...?"" i assured him i am, but it justs ""hits me every now then"" he was a little weird after that, but on our way back, he asked again, and i apologized. adam said he flirts w/ me and i dont resond back, but im afraid to really, and ive told him that multiple times.

  WELL just found out my family is moving to morris instead of with us. which i almost agree w/. 
    haley-- i talked to andru a lot last night. hes awesome, and he is confusing but in a good way. and hes 24? i thought he was our age until like the end of our conversation.
   nich-- i still plan on doing what i promised you earlier. i planed it before but ill explian what happedned. oh and i got the halloween pictures back.
   and as for that person who drives me up the wall -but in a good way- everything is the same except for the fact that this person assumes information thats alreadt been true for TOO FUCKING LONG!!

   here's some lyrics to an awesome song!!!
    ""Sorry About That""

It hasn't been that long 
Since we drank to the sunset, until it was gone 
And down with it went our pain and fear 
As we slowly broke contact 
more and more with every beer 
And we passed out in each other's arms 
Both admitting we'd never felt better 
Never felt so warm 
But awoke in each other's eyes 
Without wearing a stitch of clothing 
We were both deeply in disguise 
And maybe I just set aside 
The fact that you were broken hearted 
In my own special selfish way 
And if I hadn't set aside 
The fact that you were broken hearted 
Hell knows where your heart would be today 
Maybe with me 

It seems like it's been so long 
Since we kissed through the darkness
Until it was dawn 
Up with it came our pain and fear 
That we'd already lost each other 
We both knew that the end was near 
Maybe I just set aside 
The fact that you were broken hearted 
In my own special selfish way 
And if I hadn't set aside 
The fact that you were broken hearted 
Hell knows where your heart would be today 
Maybe with me Maybe with me
Maybe with me Maybe with me
Maybe with me Maybe with me"

I get these 4 cds. i got the new green day cd, the old old offspring, an old offspring, and a old goldfinger cd. the new green day cd is just outakes and cover songs and stuff. i already had smash, the old offspring cd, but it was burned so i got the real one since offspring are my dudes. but the old old offspring cd titled the offspring came out in 1989 right? so it turns out that that cd is almost impossible to find. you have to buy a digitally remasted one that came out a few years ago. so i buy the one remastered by nitro records. it turns out that they cut a song off of the cd so it only has 10 songs instead of 11. WTF is that? now i have to go out and finhd the remastered one by epitaph instead of the one by nitro. FUCK NITRO. and i bought a goldfinger cd i didnt have thinking it would be good becuz the other 3 i have are awesome. Yeah the cd blows. there's like 2 good songs on it out of 14. i was sosurprised, goldfinger is so good. stomping ground os one of the best cds i own. WTF. ya know whatsa good cd? ignotion. i finally have all of the offspring cds now so here they are in my opinion best to worst


1. Ixnay on the Hombre
2. Ignition      tie for 2nd
2. Smash         tie for 2nd
4. The Offspring
5. Conspiracy of One
6. Americana

yes americana is the worst offspring cd. that makes no sense becuz i kow a lot of ppl with only that cd by offspring. if ya want a good offspring cd refer to this chart. it tells the truth man. and dont buy americana. it sux."

Plus it has an awesome message inside and a cool, well not reall cool, movie on the cd. i also got the old goldfinger, and the old old offspring. which is really good. and i got punk-o-rama 7 which is awesome. and union underground live which is really good for the 5 dollars it costed. i also got an xbox game. other than that nothing has happened. i went to showstoppers like 2 times. that was pretty fun. i saw the voodoo witch girl. dude i almost pissed my pants. laura said she was pretty. man i coulda smacked her. that insults all guys in the world. i pity the fool who marries her. well thats been it. c ya"

"event","HOLY FUCK! MY DAD IS THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE ALIVE! he blew it this time, hes done, i dont like him! i almost hate him. well he went to show stoppers and he saw my mom and they sat a couple rows apart so they talked b4 the show n shit, everyhting was thought to be fine. well after aprils 1st performance ((she has 7, including a singing solo)) anyways after the first one, HE FUCKEN LEFT!!!! HE DIDNT SEE HER, HIS DAUGHTER HAVE HER 1ST AND LAST SOLO!! he didnt see her enjoy what she was doing, he didnt expirience her fucken enjoyment in life. hes such a sad fucker its so gay that i can see it!!! poor april, during intermision she, all happy, went up to my mom asking to see her father, to show him how proud of herself she was, and my mom saw him leave earlier, but figured he went to somke. well my mom lied and said he was around... so they looked for him, my sister looked disapointed. then she got over it and went on stage and had the time of her life, thinking her father was watching proudly. well then after the show she looked for him and came up to my mom and was like, ""mom, he left, he didnt even say anything to me, he left...."" ((theres something about the look of a disapointed kid, even when its something small like not getting ice-cream, but when her father dismisses her self-esteem like that, it makes me want to just strangle him!!!)) and the worst part is, shes upset as it is, and she doesnt even have a fucken clue he didnt even fucken see her. DAMN!!! this gets me too :IM 14 AND MY OWN BOYFRIEND WENT TWICE, GAVE HER SOMETHING TO BE PORUD OF, TWICE!!! HE TOLD HER SHE DID VERY WELL, TWICE. but her own father didnt do it once. and molly went too, she didnt have to do this, we wanted to, and we had fun, april was happy.... april looks up to him.. i dont, i would never care if he did this to me, but april.... aprils doesnt have the best self-essteem on her own, her own father made it go way down, but the people that may or may not always be a part of her life, helpled it up, and wilingly did this, we had to beg him to come in the first place
heh.... well im telling him all f this and im going to do it on my own... im making him tell her what he did, im obviously more powerful than him...."

Lying in my plasic bed, 
thinkin' how things were so cool to me. 

Now I've got the needle, 
and I can't bleed, but I can't breathe. 
Take it away and I want more and more. 
One day I'm gonna lose the war.

tonight, it used to be so cool. 

see thats too sad but its an amazing song."

Woman, hold your man tight

Every day I love him just a little bit more,
a little bit more, a little bit more

Every day I love her just a little bit more,
a little bit more, little bit more
Everyday I love her just a little bit more

Oh baby if you wanna get off

I saw red, I saw red, one more sacred lover that 

I shot dead

Everyday I wake up just a little bit more
feelin' like a dog out on the yard
because that's just how we are

Everyday I wonder if it's over
when I wake up realizin' that we hate
and brake down the war

You say it's black, but I can't believe you 

And if you say it's white,
you say I'm tryin to deceive you

and I'm aware of the high and the low,
and I'd be waiting for you in the middle but I just lack control

Baby if you wanna get low

Oh baby if you wanna get high

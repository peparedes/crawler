"event","I had a dream that my room was super clean, like new paint, new lighting, new furniture, the works. And Jess had spent the night with me and we were just hanging out. But in the dream I remember that I worked the day before and Jess wasn't there and that's the case on Tuesday nights. So I thought in the dream, hey, it's Wednesday!

I'm woken up by my alarm clock, so I get up, turn it off and lay back down. Next thing I know I'm dreaming again but this time Jess and I are in the kitchen. It's like 3 in the afternoon and it's really dark outside from storm clouds. She wanted something to eat so I was going to make her pancakes. We had the TV on FOX and they were playing cartoons like the used to in the afternoons. Jess and I were watching them and I thought man, the good stuff comes on Wednesdays...

Well, I started to wake up and I'm like man I don't want to get up, but wait, it's Wednesday, there's no school or work and I get to see Jessie later on. Then it hit me, IT'S SUNDAY AND I'VE OVERSLEPT! I jump straight up out of bed and saw it was 9:20 and had to rush to get ready for church... Needless to say, this is what I get for not going to bed until 2 in the morning >_>"

"event","Well I should be updating these dreams but I haven't been able to sleep much lately anyways. I keep waking up and never sleep long enough to dream. I guess I got too much stuff going through my head, who knows.

Well my last dream that I can remember... it had me at the mall or Sam's club or something like that. At any rate, I started to look for new clothes and Jess happened to be there with a Goth-dressed friend. I asked her what she thought of some clothes and she didn't seem to really pay attention, so I decided to go the front of the store where they had a DDR machine and let her and her friend shop...

I had another dream but uh... that's a private one, really weird. Though it did involve evil cats to some degree."

"event","The most prominent part of this dream is being in a scene with the characters of Ed Edd and Eddy. I believe this was partly due to it being on TV just before I woke up for the morning.

Other points I remember was craving a lot of pancakes for breakfast and Jessie was supposed to fix them for me.

Another point I was driving to a McDonalds at night in a bad part of town. I remember thinking that I had to get her something to eat before her curfew was up or she would break up with me."

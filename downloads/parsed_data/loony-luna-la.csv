Because I have been so sleepy lately, I have not gone out to see how anyone is. Ginny? Ron? Harry? Hermione? How are you all doing? I feel like it has been forever since I have talked to you all!"

"event","I got lost again! I get so frustrated with these long halls and changing stairways. Lisa found me though, and helped me back. She didn't even make fun of me! I wish more Ravenclaws were like her. I hope she and I can become friends. It would be nice to have more friends. I have'nt seen many of the Gryffindors except Hermione, and I don't think she really likes me that much. I wish Ron would come and see me. Just to say hello. I am working on a big surprise for him for Quidditch. I hope he likes it.

Love and Kisses,
Luna"

"event","I am back at school now! Finally! I have'nt really seen anyone yet, except of course, the Ravenclaw's, but not that they would pay attention to me. I am going to work on something really cool today to cheer on Ron at his Quidditch matches. The Lion hat was pretty cool, but I want to make this spectacular! I have'nt seen Ron or Ginny or Harry yet, but hopefully soon!"

Ginny~
Hello. Luna here. I just wanted to see how your holidays were. I am going back to school tomorrow. I hope to see you there. Have a nice last day of vacation!

Yours Truly,
Luna

P.S. Say hi to Ron for me"

"event","Easter Holiday is almost over. I am not sure how I feel, though. I know Dad is glad to see me, and I am glad to see him. I actually miss school for the first time, though, because I finally have friends. Sort of. I have a friend named Ginny now. She is, of course, not in Ravenclaw, because then she wouldn't be my friend and she would be taking my clothes. She introduced me to her brother and some of his friends. His name is Ron, I think I have taken a fancy to him, he is very handsome:) I also met Harry Potter (yes, Harry Potter!), and Nevill Longbottom, and Hermione Granger. They all seem nice, I really hope we can become better friends!"

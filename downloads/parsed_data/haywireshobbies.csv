"event","Played two rounds of Star Wars X-Wing against <lj user =that_xmas> yesterday. It is actually a pretty cool game.

Each fighter has a rank and point value. The pilots rank determines the order they perform their actions.

After choosing forces and setting up your table, you use a dial to choose your maneuver for each fighter. You then place that dial face down next to your fighter so that your opponent does not see the maneuver you have chosen. You get to chose a speed and turn radius. Some fighters do not get certain maneuvers. Then, going from lowest rank up, you reveal your dial/maneuver and select the proper maneuver template to move your miniature. After moving you can chose a special action depending on your fighter type (lock on, barrel roll, evade, focus). Next phase you start shooting in highest rank down order. You roll red dice for shooting (which have little blast symbols) and green for dodging (little maneuver symbols).

Production value seems pretty good. Decent quality graphic cards and thick card tokens. It's a bit pricey right now. $40 for the main set (1Xwing and 2 ties) and $15 per miniature is the current cost, but with it you get additional cards and tokens as well. I am hoping that they will release just straight miniatures, but I think the old Star Wars micro machines may be in the same scale.

It seems to be spreading pretty well amongst other miniatures game players. They are adapting scenarios from the video game to this one.

Currently there are x-wings, y-wings, ties and tie advanced fighters. Looks like they will have the millennium falcon, slave-1, tie-interceptor, and a-wing.

"event","I have a bunch of miniatures from +Chris Jachimowicz of Daleks, Ice Warriors, Cybermen, Silurians and Sea Devils that I have been itching to fix up and get painted.

So I am beginning a new project that I will probably start posting on LJ called ""UNIT Vs."" Basically Doctor Who miniatures with UNIT being the main centerpiece.

Until the ""new generation"" of Doctor Who, I always imagined UNIT as this backwater, poorly funded group with WWII era equipment and some stolen alien tech.

So I bought a squad of Bolt Action British Red Devils and Commandos to represent UNIT. The pewter cast Red Devils with berets seem to fit perfectly, but I have a bunch with helmets as well, so I need to cut of and replace those with heads I purchased from maxmini.eu. The multi-plastic commandos I purchased in a rush thinking... ""They are paratroopers with BERETS!!!"" not noticing the rest of the uniform. They do not have the right ""jacket"" and are wearing a jumpsuit sort of uniform. Not the exact look I wanted, so I will have to figure out something, maybe some sculpting.

I should also read/watch up on some Pertwee era Dr. Who since it seems there  are a lot of UNIT episodes then and it seems most of the miniatures I have harken to that time period because it looks like there are some characters in UNIT I never heard of before (Mike Yates, Liz Shaw). And I am only really familiar with Tom Baker."

"event","I found an X-Com map editor! It edits maps for both X-Com and Terror from the Deep. I have been playing with the editor and X-com is pretty standardized on its map sections. Map Sections are either 10x10 or 20x20. Full maps are 40x40, 50x50, and 60x60 for bases.

X-com bases are 2 levels.

UFO bases are 2 levels.

TFTD are usually 4 or 5 levels over two turns

Boats (which is one of the reasons I wanted to do this project) are 6 30x80 levels over two turns

T'Leth is 6 levels over three turns!

Some things I need to decide on.

1 square = 1/2"" (15mm scale) or 1"" or 30mm (28mm scale), I am guessing H = 2W

I am not sure if I want to start the base maps first or ground maps.
how much furniture? how much details

Should I make my own blocks or use Hirst Arts (they would get a cut)?
Should I use Dental Plaster or Resin?
How would I deal with multi-tiered levels? Two story buildings are not so much a big deal as the 4 story ones."

"event","An actual update!!!

Today, I am trying to place the finishing touches of a beta set of Games Workshops Lost Patrol. I found a site that had a copy of the rules and the cut out game pieces.

I printed three copies of the sheets out on the company laser printer and used spray glue to adhere the pages to some artist board. The artist board had the right feel and weight to it that I wanted for the tiles and I could easily fit 6 pages on one sheet.

Using a newly purchased guillotine-style paper cutter and scissors, I was able to quickly cut out three copies of the 30 board hex tiles. The ""Clearing"" and ""Dropship"" tiles had their backs painted black so that they are easy to find. The Clearing is the first tile you are supposed to place down and the Dropship tile is your last.

The Lurker tokens were a bit more trouble. I cannot cut circles for crap, so I purchased a 1"" diam punch, but the artist board was too thick to fit between the plates. Today, I purchased some alphabet balsa wood chits from AC Moore and had the reprinted all the lurker tokens on their own sheet. I used the circle punch on the tokens and glued them to the balsa chits. Later I will layer on another layer of white glue on top as a protective layer.

The Space Marine Scouts were just a simple trip to my FLGS, The Whiz, and probably the most expensive purchase of this whole game. They are all glued together and ready for play, but I am experimenting with the bases. I wanted to give the bases a jungle feel so I am sculpting leaves and using some glued down string as vines. I am still debating how I want to paint them. I am leaning towards Blood Ravens.

I am hoping I will have it all ready for the first Friday Gaming of the year in the Octowedge."

"event","OK... so the miniatures are pretty awesome.

Now lets look at the rules. Pretty much it is most of the first edition with the Deathwing addon rules. Differences off the top of my head are -

RULES
o When you jam on overwatch, you can clear it with an Command Point and you are still on Overwatch.

o When you are on overwatch, you get sustained fire?!

o Sustained fire only gains you a +1 (5's with a storm bolter, 4's with the AC)

o ""On Guard"" is a new form of overwatch for close combat. It gives you one reroll.

WEAPONS
o The Autocannon does not have Autofire (the kill everything down a hallway attack) anymore.

o You cannot detonate a Thunderhammer or flamer.

o Lightning claws and thunderhammer give you a +1 in close combat. You still get 2 dice with lighning claws.

o Storm shield negates 1 die from the opponent (this is assuming it will be genestealer vs. space marine, so how this will effect SM vs SM? well, its not in the rules)

GENESTEALERS
o When converting a blip, you must place a genestealer on the square the blip was on and you can NEVER place a genestealer from a voluntarily converted blip in LOS of a Space Marine.

In playing, we found that the overwatch + sustained rules are very SM friendly rules. Now granted I did see a lot of 5's and 6's rolled. But in long hallways, and rooms where 2+ termies were on overwatch, I just could not get close to the space marines. The main hope for a GS is jamming, and this was essentially removed because it now only takes 1CP and 2 GS actions to clear it where it used to cost 3 CP and 3 GS actions."

Basically, the COGS are clones. Their subfactions are different types of clones called ""Lines"" based off a specific Original and their members have different abilities according to what genetics were changed in that model or what cybernetics were attached.

I think they are stated more to what I thought the Karmans (Space Apes) were supposed to be stated at. Accurate and lots of ROF weapons with more armour.

The weird thing about the COGS is their officers, their officers must be ""Heroes"" and each one has a bunch of different stats and weapons. Their are twelve heroes, three for each ""Line"".

I just checked the webpage and fortunately they are selling each line's officers as a combined pack instead of as singles."

I won the game... by continuously running over all of his Karmans with my firetoad after it lost both its laserguns.

I took out his vehicle in the second turn. He killed off most of my tac arms, then most of my steel troopers.

All I had left was my firetoad and the tac arm... The tac arm ran in close to autohit/autokill range. Then my firetoad got in autohit/autokill range. He killed my tac arm. And he only had one guy left who could penetrate my armour. So I booked it away from him and ran over his other squad. And then backed up over them. He ran his guy in and wrestled off my last laser cannon. I then ran him over.

"event","Last night, I finally sat down and read the rules for AT-43 TACTICS.

TACTICS is the ""RPG"" version of AT-43. Looking at the play style, I think it plays more like GW's Necromunda or the Kill Team rules they set up.

Each player gets to chose a character from any of the four races starting as a ""* trooper"" (this really isn't documented) and after each mission they can promote themselves to a higher level or get abilities.

A GM (GL in the book) creates missions and sends the players off and plays the NPCs they encounter. These can be played in a campaign style as the characters advance and reach some plot goal.

The scenarios they use need the game tiles and posters (of which I have a ton) and a ton of containers (also of which I have a lot).

Some of the rules and bits of information are missing, nothing that cannot be figured out or house ruled. I hear there are a bunch of fixes in the Cry Havoc magazines.

It still seems like a fun game to run. Maybe Gaming Weekend I will run it.

The only problem I have is that the players are extremely overpowered. Actually, as far as I can tell, you cannot KILL a character. You can knock him down to 0 endurance, the medic runs over and gives him CPR, and he is up at full strength again."

"event","Last night I fixed my wing troopers that were broken off their jet plume, but I also did a few simple conversions. 

First thing I did was I clipped off the smoke plume. Took a pair of needle nose pliers and pulled out what I could of the plume in the jet nozzle. Then took a pin vise and a Xacto to clear out the jet nozzle as best I could. 

Then using the pin vise, I drilled a hole in one of the feet and in the base so that I could glue the figure to the base. I do not like the higher profile of the wing troopers in LOS games. That and they do not store as easily without me having to cut my foam case. Used a paper clip as the pinning agent. 

Then I convert my snipers. I wanted them to have a wider leg stance, so I plopped them in a cup of hot water (2 min in the microwave) and 2 steel troopers and swapped the legs out. 

Popping the legs off was easy, putting them back on was a little harder because I had to cut a bigger hole in the steel troopers legs. I also noticed that on one of the leg sets, one of the legs bent down further so his knee was touching the ground. PERFECT! 

I also wanted them to stand out a little more, so I swapped their heads with the tri-lens heads for leaders. I guess I have been watching too many SWAT shows because I wanted my snipers to have that reversed headcap look.

One table was Red Blok vs. UNA

I feel bad because I wasn't paying enough attention to the kids playing and one was very upset because he got HOSED! Rob was watching them and said that the dice were just not working for the kid and his opponent/brother? was rolling 6s a lot. He almost killed an entire squad of UNA by rushing over them with his Hemet.

The Second table was UNA vs. Therians

This one was a high pitched battle that came in so close it was wracking my nerves. The flamethrower squad was getting picked off by a squad of UNA as it approached the bunker. Two flamethrowers and the Overseer were left by the time it got in range and then FWOOOOOOSH!!! One burnt out bunker. Next to the bunker a Tac Arm Sgt stood Valiant against bane's, hekats, and storm golems. He succumb to fire after killing tons of Therians. At the end of the game it was down to an overseer and a flamethrower vs 3 steel troopers.

I am now a big fan of flamethrowers...


Questions that came up that I need to review were -

How do you melee a terrain element? Are they auto hits? (A hekat was trying to eat a bunker... but then we realized he couldn't penetrate the armor)
If a terrain element has a terrain element on top of it, what happens. (IE container on top of a container)
Can vehicles use Overwatch?
If you are on overwatch, and a unit moves out of LOS, and then destroys a terrain element placing it back in LOS, can overwatch activate?"

One had the OPERATION DAMACLES: LOST scenario set up
The other had an open board with containers and barriers up and two bunkers. I forgot the mission name.

Sadly, no one wanted to play LOST. 8D

Forces:

THERIAN
9x Storm Golems, Omega Overseer, 3 sonic guns
9x Storm Golems, Alpha Overseer, 3 sonic guns
3x Bane Goliaths, relay
1x Alpha Overseer Wraith Golgoth

UNA
9x Steel, Lt, 2 ML, 2x Medic
9x Steel, Sgt, 2 ML, 2x Medic
3x Steel Tac Arms
1x Defender Cobra Sgt

I ran four games, all of which ended in the same results. Therians lose. UNA win. Good for demos since I was playing Therians.

Analysis of game play
If you notice, the Therians are actually about 200 pts more than the UNA, but I never used the bunker which makes things even point wise.
Opposing players were scared shitless when I would create a hekat. Fortunately, for them they had plenty of Anti-Tank power with 6 missiles a turn.

For Havoc, I think I will change swap out a ML team for Volcano MGs, and add a Wing Trooper Squad or swap the defender for two fire toads.
I also need to place objectives to get them moving from their line of defense.

And for the Therians swap the Wraith for a Poltergeist and convert a Hekat into a Succubus.

A couple pictures soon as I get them off the camera."

Middle guy is an actual AT-43 medic, the end guys were repaints/conversions. 

A bit of plastic card for the reflector, some 1/35 german bits (bread bag and ammo puches), and some red cross decals... 

I should add a red cross or red star to the backpack (which is a 1/35 bread bag for a german soldier) 

GW Skull White and Bestial Brown was used for the colors"

"event","6 demos of AT-43. The Red Blok were used heavily, I think they were in all but one game. They only won one battle, almost tied for a second (2 tac arms being chased by 2 spetznatz kolussi). The first demo I had horribly underestimated the army list when I had 3 Nokalvny and not one of them could do any damage vs. a Wraith (autofail to damage).

Everyone was happy with the demos. We'll see if I made any converts."

Why am I rescuing these guys? Because I want to play dammit!

BTW Blue? Can I borrow your Red Blok guys for Totalcon?"

When I opened the box, I was hit with the wave of fumes. I unpacked everything, and sniffed at the plastics. Not them. Sniffed at the box. >_<;  Whew! Threw the box out. Grabbed the rulebook and sat down then... >_<;;

It was the BOOK!

I tried to read the book, and then started regurging... I tossed the book to the other side of the room to ""air out"".

Sometimes, I will get a book and they will smell for a couple of days, but this was overpowering. Checked the box and I noticed the MADE IN CHINA stamp."

I have been debating what I would want in a game tile, and the only reason why I would purchase/create game tiles is to have cuts for roads, ravines, rivers, shell craters, etc... Not to have hills. I can create hills, so why would I want them built into my game table?"

And then I look at the minis and think... ""They look weird.""

I keep forgetting what it is that makes them look odd. 

I have been thinking about painting up all my epic stuff and getting them on ebay before/if my account gets suspended. And the subject of using Warmachine miniatures as Titans came up. They are totally doable. So I have been looking at my warmachine figs again. And again I have been thinking... ""damn they look odd."" And that when I figured it out. It is their LEGS! They are smaller than they should be.

You look at the pictures and you see these big proud machines. Then you see the mini and their legs are almost laughable. Like someone who has been building up only their upper bodies."

"event","Made a couple molds today. 

One was for 30mm AT-43 bases. I was planning on rebasing and repainting my figs and thought I would go with some techno floors and maybe some snow on techno floors. Since I did not want to pay a bunch of money for getting more (and I could not find them without ordering them online) I decided to cast some up and use those as a base (heh) to work off.

The other was a mold of the insert for top of a soda can. I want to make some storage tanks and I have seen these done up with some nice details.

I also cast up a bunch more trunk bases for my jungle trees. I should soon have 20 more tall palms.

I wanted to get some more work done, but got distracted with trying to get a computer to recognize my brother's HDD."

What I do is this...

I keep a small Elmers glue bottle with a line half way to mark glue and water amounts and a bigger bottle thats all glue.
I fill it up with glue and water and 1 or 2 drops of dish soap (dove or ivory usually, dont think it really matters). The dish soap cuts the water tension.

Place a lot of glue on the base using the bottle. even it out with one of those cheap plastic testor's brushes
Dunk mini in the flock (or sprinkle it on if you want more control) 
Wait till it dries...

Then Glue it again!

It is that second hit you need to do to make it stay on. That should make it pretty rock hard.

PVA dries clear so it is not going to effect the paint job or the color of the flock."

"event","I have a Frosty from Wendy's and I'm smiling because I can. Last night was fucking weird. Brandon alone will understand that. We spoke, and decided that we don't know why we're together most of the time, but that we apparently like it that way. We're both mental cases, but that's okay. i love you, Brandon, even though you never come to or read or post at my sight. 
Today, I was supposed to be to work at eight to help Caseys unload the truck. i am their designated truck bitch, and occasional kitchen and donut bitch as well. I... didn't go. i woke up at 9:30 and decided it was too late to go in, but I didn't want to call then, so I just went back to bed. I stayed in bed all day until 5:30 when I decided it would be a good time to throw on some jeans and a adirty sweatsshirt and head to work. i stayed an hour and a half out of my eight hour shift, and then they started sending verifiers home due to a lack of sales. so, I left, and i went to wendy's, and now i should be doing my homework. it was due last week. :) Oh well. I mean, its not like all of my days are supposed to be spectacular, but shouldn't some of them be?
I should call Caseys tomorrow.  I need to do my h/w- fuck you-Goodnights!"

"event","I feel like a leper. Yah, not because I'm contagious and no one can touch me, but because no one really wants to have social contact with me either. That's why life is a bitch...and everyone should probably die. I'm going to settle into my drink. have a nice nite, baby!"

"event","I was released from ""the job"". I cannot go into the details of its enormously grotesque impact on my social behavior.I want to go to sleep, but i find myself, as my boyfriend currently is, only two counties away, in a style of non-conscious awakeness, if that makes any sense. AKA I can't sleep, but really really want to. I realize that I have not posted in a while. This is a bad thing. This means that i have forgotten about myself once more. oh well. i guess I'm really not that important.
I want to listen to Shania Twain, but I realize that in doing so, it will release a desire to dance around like an idiot, which will in turn cause my roommate to wake from her peaceful napping. In turn, I would then be characterized as a bitch. I cannot beleive that i just spent 11 hours staring at a computer screen, and I came home and am now doing the same thing. Is it dangerous to spend that much time looking at a monitor? Just wondering. I also cannot believe that I just spelled believe wrong! 
I'm rambling aren't I?
I wish I weren't, but in these situations there is no preventative medicine for alteration of behavior. I also do not want to erase my rambling because the action would make my posting very short, and I would prefer to have posted a lot tonight, with little impact on the outside world, not that anyone is reading this. Did I actually finish that last sentennce? I'm too lazy to look up at the computer screen.
Valentines Day was very nice. I know Brandon thinks he fucked up,  but it was fun to have so much chaos. Now, I just need to figure out how to get him away from the gamecube. Impossible. I think I will need a goat, and I have no way of acquiring a goat. 
I have pinkeye. My eye is pink. yes, that was intelligent. I am also very poor, but so are all folk right before they make it really big-blah- if I only had direction or ambition. Oh well. 
I love ... ....... !
I love ... .... !"

"event","Not in the mood. I was released from work at 1:52a.m., 8 minutes early. I think I'm going to get fired today. Last night I ciouldn't keep my eyes focussed on the screen, I was extremely tired, and I kept going to the restroom for femeinine purposes. My superviser came over and told me I couldn't get up that often. I hate being a woman. i think I hate being a person. So when I got off work at 1:52, my wonderful boyfriend was waiting for me at my current res., and he took me home to his place, where I passed out and did not regain consciousness again until 1:30, at which point, he got into the shower and I headed upstairs to look through the new Victorias Secret catalog. I am still tired. I still don't feel as if I've caught up on sleep for this week. I should go do something productive for the week. I should... It is so nice to know that no one is reading this, but it is still so relaxing to just sit here and type out my thoughts.

"event","Fingers racing across the keyboard... but nothing to type. How Pathetic? It is too early in the morning to think. I have just been released from my 2nd job today, or yesterday. It's all one day to me, but there is some identified separation between the days. It is when I leave one job, come home to change for my other job, and then leave again. Sometimes Brandon waits for me after work, so he can see me for a few minutes. That's really nice. 
I've started a diet. I have been taking Xenadrine EFX for about a week. I lost 4lbs, but then somehow I ate at Carlos O Kelley's two days in a row, each time consuming los enchiladas de San Carlos. Delicious, but not on my diet plan. You can imagine that I have gained all of my weight back, with an additional pound to seal the deal. Yes, I will officially be bitchy and depressing for the rest of the week. Luckily, most of you are probably nowhere near me. Poor Brandon. 
I must finish creating my page... 

          ... find something better to do..."

"event","I am sooooo bored right now.  Do you know how horrible it is to be the only person who only has one final especially when you don't have to study for that final because you aren't doing well in the class and the final is not going to help your grade at all.  Apparently most people don't know what that is like but for some reason none of my professors or TA's have felt the need to give me finals during finals week in all of the time that I have been at MSU.  But in other studying news I am reading a book for my wonderful IAH class even though it is basically over(hey that is what boredom does to you) and it is really good even though it is a bit gory.  What do you expect from a book about war?
So for all of you that want news on the boy front...there is no news.  Well not really except for the fact that I have finally given up...you know what I am talking about and if you don't then you can ask me.  But that really isn't any news especially coming from the girl that works a shift that is called the nunnery...even though I can't really say that name applies anymore even in my case.  But actually maybe I am not giving up everything completely.  I have a prospective hookup with Jon from Kettering when I come back from break...he is still in Ohio doing fun engineering things but will be back at school at the beginning of January.  All of my AL girls and the other honorary AL girl, Jordan will definitely have to go there to find some decent guys especially since MSU seems to have none or at least no single ones for that matter.  And I can always walk on over to Pi Kapps if I ever want a random hookup.  I know Oliver, Jaime, Riyad or Dave will always be up for it oh and Mike also.  But enough of that life is boring, I am still bored with just a couple minutes fewer before I have to go to work at Brody...where I am now stuck for the rest of my life since I just got a promotion to level III.  Only 2 more days until I get to go home YAY!!!"

"event","So I haven't written in a long time but I figured I would even though I am not sure that anyone reads this anymore.  Well the girls and I had a lot of fun last night at Pi Kapps.  I would have to say for me not being drunk I gave one to many lap dances though I got a lot in return especially from Oliver aka Harry Potter.  But it was a great night nonetheless.  Erin and Jordan were pretty trashed but luckily Elena and I were there to keep them from going on any ""house tours"".  But all I can say is when is the next party because I will totally be there!"

"event","I really love Christmas.  Even though neither of my parents like it at all, I love it.  I love giving people presents and seeing how much they like it.  I also like to be around my family which is now one of the only times I get to see them.  It has been so much fun so far.  I have spent time with almost everybody that I can possibly spend time with.  But of course all great things have to come to an end and now I am only one week away from having to go back to work and to school and everything else.  Oh joy!  Oh well at least the semesters go by really quick so hopefully this semester will be the same."

"event","I only have one more final to go until I go home.  I can't wait to be in my own bed even with Drew snoring right next to me in his bed because it is so much more comfortable than my bed here.  I also get to see all of my friends that I haven't seen in forever like Sue and maybe Christine.  Last time I saw her I had to go to work like five minutes later.  I don't think she was very happy about that but I have to work in order to go to college.  
So I 4.0 my anthropology class.  That definitely makes up for failing math again.  Since I have to retake it again maybe third times a charm for me...or the fourth...or the fifth.  Oh well I never said I would be good in calculus.  
So see you later and my next entry should be from home.  Yay!!!"

"event","It feels like I haven't slept in days which I really haven't.  I need to stop waking up every hour on the hour like I have been doing.  It is not the best way to sleep at all.  I am also almost falling asleep in class which is going to get me in trouble if I keep it up.  I am telling you this really sucks.  Oh well not much I can really do about it.  
I am so glad I haven't had to work in such a long time.  I really needed the break but tomorrow it will be back to my life.  Ugh! I don't want to work in dishroom this weekend, I like not working in the dishroom and not feeling gross. But of course I must go back and get a paycheck that I thought I needed but really don't because the financial aid office lied to me as usual.  Why do I trust so many people?  I think I need to stop that before it kills me.  
Oh yeah I had a nightmare about Jody last night.  He was hunting me down and threatening to kill me.  Of course that just adds to all of my boy problems.  At least he has left me alone for the past 5 months.  Now if he would only leave my brother alone!!!"

"event","I am home finally.  I haven't been home in so long.  It has been a busy day(mostly spent in the car) but I don't mind because I get to see my family and I get real food not caf. food(yes mom that does not say cat).  So I have done as much visiting as I can handle..I got to see Mr. Adas after about a million years.  I got to drive also.  I haven't driven in so long.  I thought I was going to kill somebody.  I need to do some more driving while I am here which I am sure I will do.
I am glad I got away.  This definitely gives me some time to think about my guy situation which I seriously need to do.  I think I will try to find a guy by getting out more and partying more on the weekend.  Heck I am a teenager let me party while I can.  
Well I gotta go.  I am going to eat food.  Yay!!!"

"event","I am really confused right now.  I mean I like two guys but I don't want to get involved with either of them right now because I work with both and it would be really weird.  I need to get out and find guys that I don't work with even though I don't really have all that much time because I am always at work and when I am done with work I am usually too tired to go out.  Sucks for me doesn't it.  But I will find another guy. I have to because I need to get over these two...SOON!
Somebody please tell me what I am supposed to do!!!
I am so glad I leave tomorrow.  I really need a break.  I am exhausted, I miss my family and I really need to leave here for a while so I can think about things.  I also need to get away from work.  I really don't like it there but I know I have a job if I stay so I do.  I also get along with everybody there but I think that is more of a problem than something good.  I just need to get away.  Yay home tomorrow with real food, my family and my old life."

"event","Well actually I can.  I guess I do talk about him a lot but it is only because I see him all of the time.  Well now she knows both.  I hope she is happy.  I do know hers also so hah.  Jenny lets just say you better keep this to yourself.  If anyone else finds out I know it's you that told them.  I am trying to find a normal guy that isn't in a weird situation.  I really am working on it.  Soon I am telling you, it will happen soon.  
I talked to Christine the other day.  I guess she is doing well at GVSU.  She found a guy now all she has to do is talk to him.  Maybe it will happen but I really doubt it.  We are just not like that.  That is one thing I need to start working on or I won't get married until I am eighty and I am only getting married because he is the only guy that isn't dead yet.  I won't even have to choose and he won't really care because he can't see and is going to die in a couple of days, weeks, months or years. Do I sound pessimistic or what?
I am telling you I will work on it...SOON!!!"

"event","Okay everybody I got Meek's Christmas present and it is the gift that he really wanted so I am really excited to give it to him on Christmas Day.  I hope he likes it.  
I get to go home next week.  I need to go home...soon. I am about ready to go insane with papers to write and tests to take and tons of reading.  I also can't afford to skip any more classes or my grades will lower even more.  So a break will help me finish the last four weeks of school and then I get an even bigger break.  I am also looking forward to real food, not caf. food.  I also get to see my entire family which I haven't done in forever.  I see them in small groups usually for only a few minutes.  I hate that.  I am really close to my family and I am used to seeing everyone everyday so the transition to twenty minutes every couple of weeks really sucks.  Next semester I am definitely not working every Saturday.
Bye."

I already missed one this week and she would get really mad at me if I skipped another class.  But the paper is getting there.  I have two and half pages written out of 5-10 page paper.  Then I have to write my reflective commentary which is so easy.  All I have to do is write about what I wrote about and how I wrote it.  This RC should be interesting since I couldn't write the paper.  
Just thought I would let you know."

"event","Somebody help me.  I have writers block and my paper is due in less than 5 hours.  I don't know what to write even though I have tried writing this paper for days now and I just can't think.  I think I won't go to class today anyway because I am tired and sitting through a two hour class is so horrible especially when you are supposed to have read the paper we are discussing and I haven't.  
So life sucks.  I am doing crappy at work lately and I don't know why.  I think I am just getting tired of that damn dishroom.  And Travis my supervisor seems annoyed that I have started taking my half hour breaks even though I am getting docked for that half hour so I feel I have the right to take them.  But I still don't want to piss off my supervisors right now because I am up for supervisor which I really want to get so I get a raise.  Oh well can't take back the weekend now."

It doesn't really matter since have of the people were sent home early and I didn't take a break. But I still felt bad.  I am never late to work.  It really sucked.  Tim will never let me live this down.  
Jenny is coming up to go shopping with me today.  I got to see her for a little while on Friday night but it was a really short time.  So I am really excited.  Yay!!!"

I hope I did good though just because I don't like doing a bad job, everybody knows that.  Oh well.  I have to work tonight.  Suprise, suprise.  I don't mind though because I am only on serving line, not on dish room.  That million of hours is tomorrow.  Other than all of this I have math today.  I am going for 3 passed tests in a row.

"event","Wow today was so long.  First I failed an exam.  Well I didn't exactly fail but I didn't do really well. Then of course I had to go to work, Suprise, suprise for me right?  At work Chad, my evil toad of a supervisor, yelled at me and was really rude.  I hate getting yelled at especially when I was really dizzy and had to eat before I passed out.  But no he couldn't ask me what was going on or why I didn't tell him I was going on break he was just a dick about it and yelled at me.  Oh well.  Soon I will be a supervisor and I won't have to worry about Chad ordering me around.  Maybe I will one day order him around.  I doubt it only because I try not to act like a bitch because then I feel bad and want to apologize.  Why am I so nice?  I think I need to fix that.  
I finally talked to my mom.  It has been a while.  I was really excited.  I think somebody in my family is actually going to come visit me soon.  I like that. I am glad to know that I am not forgotten.
I need to find a boyfriend soon. I haven't had one in forever.  I keep thinking that I am some kind of loser because no guys like me and ask me out and if they do generally they are losers(Tony, Jody, Leeches.  I think I will work on that tomorrow or maybe after the weekend since I have to work so much this weekend.  
Oh well that is all of my ranting today.  Stay tuned for more."

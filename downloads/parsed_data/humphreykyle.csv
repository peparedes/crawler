"event","So I guess I'll start using this thing now... I'll try to at least. Life's pretty good right now, it's been a beautiful summer, and everyone knows that is a good thing. I've got a job at a store that sells video games, comic books and lots of other nerdy items... I love it!&nbsp; I've been hanging out with friends a lot lately which is awesome. That's something most of my summers lacked, but this time I'm changing that! I just wanna go to my camp like, now, cause that's something I love to do in the summer. We've got a trip scheduled for next week when a bunch of people are going to go up there, hope it works out!

I went to Boston with my sister and some friends to see Hanson last week, it was a blast. If you don't know by now they're probably my favorite band! They played pretty much every song I hoped they would so I was pretty happy about that. I also got to meet lots of new people (Kylie!) and made some new friends which is always awesome. I hope I can get to another concert soon!

Anyways, that's about it for me. I'm gonna do other stuff now (MSN).

Ta!"

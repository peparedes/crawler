"event","Hey everyone! I got back a test today, and guess what..... 23/25! That's a great mark for me, considering the teacher is an ANAL RETENTIVE BEEYATCH. *cough*, anyway, the recent trend seems to be writing about how cool our friends are (which is true), so I figure i'll write about *mine*!

Chrissy?!: Always filled with happiness and joy, but especially sarcasm. :) She's fun to hang around with, and she reminds me of myself. Oh yeah, and she's moving in wit me. 

Valar: During my summer at VV, I hung around with him. He REALLY rocks, and is a l337 hax0r. I love talking about philosophy with him. Yum!

Lila: Wow. Wowowow. If I were a girl, and I looked in the mirror, this is what I would see. She reminds me a lot of myself, and I can speak to her on an extremly high intellectual level. She's wayyy too smart for her age! :P

Gretchen: Too many things to list! Funny, happy, and to-the-point! I love talking to her over the MOO. It's a really amazing experience.

Corinna: Corinna is someone who is really special to me. Ever since I came to Virtual Ventures, she acted like my mentor, encouraging and guiding me. I also enjoy discussing philosophy with her.

Norm: Norm is a great friend, and also my DDR apprentice! Though he can be a bit horny some times, he's still really cool to hang out with. You rock Norm! :)

Heero-Yuy: You rock Eric! He introduced me to the whole DDR craze. He looks extremly stylin' with his black trenchcoat. Chrissy says he looks like Jim Carey.

Tuvok: If it isn't the scat eating monkey himself. Tuvie was also one of the first few people I met at VV, and though he isn't coming back this year, I will always remember him. :)

Meggi: Meggi, your someone who I find extremely special. Your so unique and outstanding in your own way, it's amazing. Too many good things to list them all. Rock on!"

Good afternoon, and I hope your all enjoying your sundays. I would have written something in here this morning, but I was way too lazy. Anyway, i'm about to go do some homework. I hate homework, the devil's handywork I tell you! I might go somewhere later, but no where definate yet, but any suggestions are welcome. I took this Death Test thingy, and they said that i'm going to die at the age of 69. Isn't that great? Well, at least it's a 'cool' number. Meh. Had a long conversation with Lila and Chrissy and Latavia last night. That was fun, talked about a lot of interesting stuff. My throat still hurts, but i'll probably get over it. I should change out of my boxers, too, but everyone knows my feelings about getting off my lazy ass. I'm having difficulty convincing my parents that getting a PlayStation 2 would be good for the family, with us needing a DVD and all. Oh, my basement is finally finished, and we're putting a big screen tv in there. I wonder if we could maybe arrange a mini-fridge or something.. Mmm. Yeah, so soon i'll have to crawl down to the basement again to use my computer. Aside from there being no space up here, I kinda liked it. :) I'll post something more interesting later.. I promise. :)"

Chrissy is moving in to our house, because she seems to not like her parents. Yay! :) *coughs, sneezes, sniffles* Meh, still not feeling well, took some tylenol, so hopefully I will soon. Some people are demented, and sexually frustrated, like Norm, and he's really scaring me.... Anyway, I gotta go clean out my sisters room. ;) (Just kidding)"

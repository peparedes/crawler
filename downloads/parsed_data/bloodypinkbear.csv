Unbetaed. :x Concrit welcome.<br /><br />Written for the <a href=""http://novemberlite.livejournal.com/34720.html"">Kinkspiration Round Two: Crossdressing</a><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Merlin raps his fingers on the desk"">Merlin raps his fingers on the desk, looking at the squirming <strike>man</strike> boy in front of him. A furrow forms in the middle of his forehead, his mouth thin and unhappy.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Arthur, I thought I told you it was against the school rules for boys to wear the girls&rsquo; uniform to school,&rdquo; he scolds gently, &ldquo;and that the next time you did it, I&rsquo;d have to punish you.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Arthur looks eager, then schools his face into a defiant mask, sweeping his fingers through his short blonde hair.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;I like wearing this uniform, Mister Emrys. The pants make my legs itch.&rdquo; Arthur runs his fingers up his thigh to demonstrate, smirking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m scared of you anyway.&rdquo; He takes a step forward and cants a hip on the wooden desk.<br />&nbsp;<br />Merlin clears his throat. He can&rsquo;t deny that hearing his student&rsquo;s posh, public school voice while seeing him in the girls&rsquo; uniform of their school, is making his heartbeat thrum in his ears. It&rsquo;s more than just a little inappropriate, he thinks, but he can&rsquo;t help himself.<br />&nbsp;<br />He takes a moment to stare at Arthur critically. Arthur&rsquo;s cheeks are flushed, his pupils blown wide with adrenaline. He&rsquo;s wearing the girls&rsquo; blouse with its soft, Peterpan collar and skirt which has obviously been hiked up, revealing lean thighs lightly dusted with hair. Not to mention the hint of red he can see under the white of the uniform skirt. This damn student of his is breaking at least three school rules of the uniform kind.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Like I said, I&rsquo;ll have to punish you. You&rsquo;re a boy, so I&rsquo;m allowed to spank you for being naughty.&rdquo; Merlin says this while rummaging around his desk for the ruler he keeps in handy. He does this for five minutes while Arthur waits. To his confusion, it&rsquo;s nowhere to be found. Arthur coughs.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;I may have stolen it and thrown it into a ditch during recess.&rdquo; Arthur says and folds his arms. &ldquo;But I do have another idea, Mister Emrys,&rdquo; he says, his voice dropping into a husky whisper. Merlin looks up sharply.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Instead of spanking me, you could bend me over the table&hellip; and fuck me.&rdquo; His voice catches on the last three words. With a deft hop, he&rsquo;s on the teacher&rsquo;s desk. Merlin can feel his face turning crimson, his ears burning hot. He&rsquo;s frozen for a moment. Arthur takes this to mean consent and crawls forward to tug at his tie. Instinctively, Merlin flinches away, but Arthur manages to grab a fistful of his shirt and <i>pulls. </i>Merlin totters forward but by some strange strike of bad luck, the wheelie chair rolls away, unbalancing him and bringing Arthur down with him, skirts flying.<br />&nbsp;<br />Merlin regains his wits moments later only to find himself pinned down by the muscular bulk of none other than a smiling Arthur Pendragon. Still in a skirt. Of course.<br />&nbsp;<br />What he didn&rsquo;t expect, was for Arthur to lift his skirt and begin rutting against him in earnest.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Oh god, stop. Stop.&rdquo; Merlin closes his eyes and moans, clenching his fists to stop himself from touching his errant student. His traitorous fingers twitch and his cock stirs. Arthur grabs his hand and stuffs it down his briefs without finesse. Or at least, he thought it was briefs until he tries to shake his hand off and feels the delicate lace under his fingers. The shocking realization that Arthur is wearing <i>knickers, </i>red lacy knickers, is enough to fill his cock to aching. He&rsquo;s so confused, from the fall still, and from the lust that&rsquo;s fogging his mind.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;<i>Touch me</i>, Mer&hellip; Mister Emrys.&rdquo; Arthur moans, pleading. He rolls his hip a little and the feel of the satiny skin juxtaposed with the scratchy lace breaks Merlin. He acquiesces with a hysterical sob and curls his hand around Arthur. It&rsquo;s hot and it throbs in his hand. He pulls jerkily, feeling the pre-come leaking out of Arthur&rsquo;s slit on his palm now. They go on for a while, Arthur murmuring encouragement with increasingly filthy words. Merlin thinks he&rsquo;s either in heaven or a very bad nightmare.<br />&nbsp;<br />Abruptly, Arthur pulls away from Merlin&rsquo;s hand to unbutton his slacks and unzips him, freeing him from his boxers with a &lsquo;pop&rsquo; of the elastic band. His fingers rub tenderly at the head and tugs the delicate skin up and down, spreading the quickly-forming liquid. He&rsquo;s panting, his lips obscenely pink and his eyes are glittering and dark. Merlin thinks he looks like a wild animal about to strike. Arthur turns his eyes onto his face, and swoops down to catch Merlin&rsquo;s mouth, sucking viciously at his bottom lip while still jerking him off. His lips are chapped, and eventually his mouth opens on Merlin&rsquo;s, tongue lapping at the seam of his mouth. Merlin welcomes him and their tongues curl together lewdly, chasing and retreating. It is a wet, sloppy kiss. It&rsquo;s the hottest kiss Merlin has ever had.<br />&nbsp;<br />Still retaining a now-misplaced sense of propriety, Merlin hesitates, placing a shaky hand on the curve of Arthur&rsquo;s ass and then groans &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; before pulling down the knickers roughly. The sudden movement causes the lace to rub roughly on Arthur&rsquo;s cock and he howls.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Just&hellip; goddammit, forget about it and fuck me. <i>Now.&rdquo;</i><br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, yeah, um, the lube.&rdquo; Merlin&rsquo;s brain is still foggy with desire as he reaches into his pocket for a foil packet. Arthur manages to roll his eyes and rips the packet with his teeth, soaking his fingers in the cool liquid and warming it up, before inserting two fingers roughly into his arse. Merlin chuckles at his impatience and applies the rest of the lube onto his cock, giving it a couple of pulls, before Arthur gently but efficiently moves his hands to his thighs. He sinks down carefully onto Merlin&rsquo;s cock, bottoming out and Merlin can see he&rsquo;s straining with the burn of not enough preparation, so he rubs soothing circles onto the small of his back.<br />&nbsp;<br />Arthur pauses for a moment to get used to the stretch, exhaling in short pants. Then he begins to move, and Merlin loses his ability to think. All he remembers is reaching out to curl his fingers around Arthur so they both can come together.<div style=""text-align: center;"">------</div><br />&ldquo;We should try that again,&rdquo; Arthur says, satisfied. They&rsquo;re laying on the queen-sized bed, cuddling.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Yeah well, maybe you&rsquo;ll have the endurance to actually <i>keep up</i> the pretense the next time we do it.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;&hellip;Shut up, Merlin.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />FIN.</lj-cut><br />"

<b>Series:</b> The Kastor Chronicles
<b>Character: </b>Mikah 

<b>Summary:</b> After the first time Kastor leaves him, Mikah mulls over the events.

<lj-cut text=""It was, Mikah reflected later, a fairytale."">It was, Mikah reflected later, a fairytale. A Mara falling in love with a half-breed thief. A paid professional falling in love with his client. Some things were just too good to be true. He twirled his braid in his hand pensively. <i>Had</i> he really loved him? To ask of himself as payment... It seemed a bit much; bordering on obsession. But then again, what <i>did</i> Mara know of love? He had his chance to learn, and he hadn't done it very well. A botched opportunity, Mikah mused. He remembered Kastor's final smile - crooked; revealing yet concealing. Scalpel sharp. Certainly not affectionate, or whatever you called the way human lovers treated each other.

He put the thought away in his mental folders, determined not to Forget. Such lessons were better remembered. Social interaction with humankind was, after all, necessary to his plans.

And just as he was determined to remember this, he had also implicitly Forgotten a vision of dreams and futures; of excruciating mental anguish as he said good-bye to the one with pale skin and stormy eyes.</lj-cut>"

Uh, the bravery points system still works though?? IDK, playing with canon. Con crit appreciated, I know I'm not exactly the best writer. XD;<br /><br />&quot;You want me to <i>WHAT</i>?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Our session guitarist. He ran off halfway! Please, Neku, you've gotta help us.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;We're going to play the guitar track from the sound system, so you just have to look pretty and <i>grind</i>. Give the fangirls a bit of fanservice. Shiki will be watching, y'know?&quot; <br /><br />Neku flushed. He hated how everyone thought he had a thing for Shiki - especially after Week 2, when he'd tried so desperately to win the Game for her sake. <i>Ugh, whatever.</i> Since 777 <i>had</i> helped him that one time with the keypin, resulting in his erasure... A debt was a debt, right?<br /><br />&quot;Okay, I'll do it.&quot; Neku let out a breath of air he didn't realise he had been holding.<br /><br />&quot;Awesome, dude. I'll let Tenho and BJ know! And then I'll treat you at Ramen Don afterwards, provided we don't get waylaid by fangirls of course.&quot; 777 smiled and fingered his dog collar accessory, pleased that he had gotten what he wanted. Everything was in place and going as planned.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;When did I become Brave enough to wear this?&quot; Neku scowled angrily at Shiki, who was gushing and forcing him into a pair of Lapin Angelique pants which had a couple of... bandages hanging off them. He looked at them in distaste. Shiki merely giggled.<br /><br />&quot;Def Marche is a rock band! You've got to dress the part! Granted, they aren't a visual kei band... But I think it suits their style. What do you think, Neku?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I just want my sweatshirt back, thanks,&quot; Neku grumbled. He felt... strange without his usual clothes.<br /><br />&quot;Awww Neku, don't be such a spoilsport. Listen to me, the queen of Shibuya trends! Anyway, to tone down the look a little, we'll go for a khaki hoodie and red sneakers. Ahhh, perfect!&quot; Shiki looked appreciatively at Neku's simple but suitable outfit and burst into a new fit of giggles.<br /><br />&quot;Imagine that Neku! Performing with Def Marche! You have no idea how lucky you are!!! Promise me you'll help me get their autographs?? Oh, and Eri loves Tenho's performance during lives! Please relay the message to him??&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yeah... sure. I'll try to remember,&quot; he replied a little tiredly, picking at the hoodie that Shiki had bought for him, noticing that it was strangely... the colour of Joshua's hair. Neku mentally slapped himself, annoyed.<br /><br />How long had it been since he'd returned to the RG? A week? Two? He'd been happy to see all of them again. Shiki, Beat, Rhyme... even Kariya and Uzuki. The only one he hadn't seen so far yet was Joshua. <i>He's probably busy with Composer duties</i>, Neku thought dully, feeling more than a little abandoned. It was as if he'd been used, killed for the Composer's own purposes, twice, then thrown back into the world of the living like some kind of pawn. Not that he minded being alive, but it was just so irritating and typical of Joshua to leave him hanging like that.<br /><br />&quot;Well, Neku, we're all set! I'll be rooting for you with Eri in the front row!&quot; Shiki's eyes sparkled behind her glasses, pulling Neku into a hug. He smiled and returned the embrace. <br /><br />&quot;Yeah. Thanks, Shiki. For you know, being my friend.&quot; An awkward cough.<br /><br />&quot;And thanks for accepting me for who I am.&quot; she replied in a serious voice, finally letting go of Neku and smiling up at him gently. A quiet moment was shared between them, nothing else said. Nothing <i>needed</i> to be to fill the comfortable silence between them. The Game had only lasted three weeks, but in those three weeks Neku had learned so much about himself and other people. He had learned to trust, even if it meant opening himself to betrayal. And Shiki was one of those people that he trusted and cared for dearly.<br /><br />Then the moment was lost as Shiki started pulling him to A-East to prepare for the upcoming live.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />777 sung into the mic, fingers caressing its spiked wings as he stared into the audience intensely. Each word was sung out and almost shouted with emotion, sending the crowd into a frenzy as they waved their hands in the air and headbanged at the appropriate moments. BJ was busy at his drumset, drumming up a fast rhythm to go along with the vocals as Tenho strummed the chords on his bass.<br /><br />Neku was... trying to imitate what he'd seen from Shiki's live videos. Fingers looking like they were expertly strumming a melody, he moved around the stage quite confidently although he was a bundle of nerves inside. He nodded to the beat and at one moment, licked the slender neck of the guitar, mentally cringing. Fangirls went wild and screamed.<br /><br />He could almost spot Shiki in the mass of girls in the front row, bouncing and looking extremely happy in her position. Neku smiled, his eyes scanning the crowd quickly as he tried to make eye contact with the audience when he noticed <i>Joshua</i> standing near the back, looking at him in that predatory way of his. <br /><br />Neku stared, shocked, but recovered after a while.<br /><br /><i>What's he doing here? I thought I'd never see him again... Will he stay until I get to talk to him? What's he thinking?</i> Frustration ran through Neku like a slow, sharp blade. He had so many things to say; so many things to ask. Didn't think he'd get straight answers from Joshua, but he had to try at least.<br /><br />He hoped the rest of the night would pass by quickly.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />After eating and joking with the guys at Ramen Don, Neku had passed Eri's message, gotten everyone's signatures, and just about felt ready to go home and crash. But then he'd remembered Joshua's message - <i>Meet me at the graffiti wall at Udagawa.</i> He'd been indignant, thinking about Joshua's insensitivity and the irony of it all but finally agreed. Things needed to be settled between them after all.<br /><br />When he reached, he had half-expected Joshua not to be present. But the enigmatic boy was right there -  staring at CAT's graffiti where everything had started. It had used to be a place of solace for Neku, but now it held a myriad of meanings and emotions to it. Anger, betrayal, friendship.<br /><br />&quot;So, what did you call me here for, <i>Composer</i>?&quot; Neku couldn't resist a jibe at the calm, fair-haired boy, who didn't look like the person who controlled the fate of Shibuya.<br /><br />Joshua turned around, smiling. &quot;Pleasant as ever, I see, Partner. By the way, you were great. Making all those girls scream for you. <i>Hee hee.</i>&quot; Neku resisted the urge to punch Joshua, knowing full well that he could stop an incoming fist as easily as he could prevent a shower of bullets from raining onto him.<br /><br />&quot;Did you want to meet me to say all that?&quot; Neku growled, irritated from both his exhaustion and Joshua's less-than-stellar personality. &quot;I want answers. Now.&quot;<br /><br />At that, Joshua's smile turned even sweeter, if possible. &quot;I thought I had already told you, Neku. I needed someone to represent me. A proxy. What better way to do that, than to find someone who was attracted to the mental imprinting in Mr Hanekoma's art?&quot;<br /><br />Neku's head throbbed. Joshua was never going to give him straight answers. He'd wanted to ask him about his betrayal, his pretense, why he'd allowed him back into the RG... so many things he'd wanted to ask. But he knew now that he'd never get them from Joshua. He decided that he should ask about something else, then.&quot;Where were you, these two weeks?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why Neku, did you miss me? I'm flattered.&quot; Joshua feigned surprise, placing a hand dramatically over his chest.<br /><br />Neku couldn't find a comeback to that. He <i>had</i> missed bantering with Joshua, despite Joshua being his killer and all.<br /><br />&quot;Yeah. I did.&quot;<br /><br />This time, it was Joshua's turn to remain silent. He hadn't expected Neku to be honest to him and look like a lost puppy whose master had abandoned it. Joshua's eyes softened uncharacteristically and he reached out, pulling Neku close to his chest. They stayed like that for a while, not saying anything else, Neku getting a sense of deja vu. As well as feeling increasingly uncomfortable.<br /><br />&quot;So... Uh. I mean.&quot; he turned bright red, scratching at his head nervously as he pulled back.<br /><br />&quot;Embarrassed, are we?&quot; Joshua laughed, while Neku punched his arm half-heartedly.<br /><br />&quot;Where do we stand now? And are you ever going to come back?&quot; Neku swallowed.<br /><br />&quot;We're wherever you want us to be, Neku.&quot; Joshua replied enigmatically, thin lips curling into his infernal smile. &quot;And I <i>am</i> the Composer, you know. Can't drop by as and when I want to 24/7.&quot;<br /><br />Neku tried to stifle his disappointment.<br /><br />&quot;You can come to the UG whenever you want though, Neku. It's a free-entry pass from me to you. Ask Mr. Hanekoma about it?&quot;<br /><br />At that, Neku nodded quietly.<br /><br />&quot;Well then, I have to go now. Wouldn't want a repeat if the last time, would we? I did bring Minamimoto back to life with reduced powers... but while I'm here in the RG he's probably aiming for my seat again. Ta-ta.&quot; Joshua waved and walked away.<br /><br />Neku stood still, unable to move. Suddenly, in a flash of courage, he reached out to grab at the edge of Joshua's sleeve.<br /><br />&quot;I... I trust you. Just wanted to let you know that. Yeah. See you.&quot; He looked away, embarrassed, shoving his hands into his pockets.<br /><br />&quot;I know you do.&quot; Joshua smiled, a real smile this time.<br /><br />A.N: LOL I don't think bands (indie or no) do that, the original idea was just to shove Neku in that situation... but of course Joshua just has to insert himself.

<b>Series:</b> Kingdom Hearts
<b>Characters:</b> Axel/Roxas friendship

<b>Summary:</b> Ice cream. Friendship. A little white lie. <i>Goodbye, Axel.</i>

<lj-cut text=""Hey Axel"">""Hey Axel.""

Axel snapped out of his reverie and turned to look at his best friend. ""Yeah, Roxas?""

""I wonder what my Other is like,"" Roxas gave a wry smile and continued eating his popsicle. ""I mean, I don't remember anything about him."" Swallow. ""How he looks like and all."" A long, thoughtful lick.

Axel was speechless for once, his viridian eyes sad. But it wasn't truly sadness, for Nobodies had no hearts.

He had met Sora during his assignment in Castle Oblivion; in fact, his main reason for seeking Sora out was because he was Roxas's Somebody. They were so different, yet so similar in some ways. Roxas's eyes were a cold, cold blue while Sora's were passionate and full of life. But they both were equally stubborn.

Axel wanted to tell him. How his Other was - his single-mindedness in finding his memories, his friends, helping someone whom he didn't even know... Sora was noble. (Though a tad naive.)

He opened his mouth to speak but suddenly recalled Xemnas's instruction and implied threat if he did not comply.

""I wouldn't know, Roxas."" Axel finally replied, smirking.

<i>Liar.</i>

""I know."" Roxas nodded his head slowly, finishing off the cool treat. ""Do you remember your Other, Axel?"" Curious now.

""I..."" Axel hesitated. He remembered, how it was like to have a heart. But to tell Roxas, who did not even recall Sora's name...

""Yeah, I do."" Perhaps, perhaps he could use his memories to fill in the gap that Roxas so desperately tried to bridge.

""Tell me."" Roxas almost pleaded. Almost.

Sighing, Axel made a show of taking off his gloves. ""It's a long story, kid.""

A year later, in a white-washed room, when Roxas finally remembered who he was, a feeling of stabbing betrayal pierced his heart.

""You lied, Axel."" A painful whisper."

<b>Series:</b> Kingdom Hearts
<b>Pairing:</b> Riku/Sora

<b>Summary:</b> Back at Destiny Islands, nothing has changed.

<lj-cut text=""Riku and Sora"">Riku and Sora were wrestling on the floor, the older boy naturally having the upper hand. It was sweltering and his shirt had been thrown carelessly into a corner. Riku stared pointedly at Sora's own shirt, asking why he did not want to remove it when the weather was just so darned hot.

""I just don't wanna!"" Sora retorted childishly, his sky-blue eyes flashing fiercely.

""Why? Scared that I'll see how scrawny you really are?"" Riku taunted with a smirk.

Sora frowned, a growl emitting from the back of his throat as he pushed his hands roughly against Riku's bare chest and made him stumble.

""Am not scrawny!"" he insisted as he made an attempt to get up. Riku however, had other plans. With a quick roll, Sora was once again on his back, his arms pinned.

""Heh, not so strong now, are you, Keyblade Master?"" Riku smiled ferally, staring into the deep azure of Sora's eyes, and froze. Suddenly gaining courage after the months since they arrived back at the Islands safely, he blurted out the first thing he could think of.

""C... Can I touch your keyblade?"" Riku winced. How did it... how did his love confession end up sounding like some cheap pick-up line? Sora's eyebrows quirked in surprise at Riku's seemingly inane request.

""Why... was that what you wanted? Sure!"" Sora laughed in relief, his eyes crinkling at the corners. Riku let out a nervous breath and smiled in response. He started to speak, but was interrupted by something thrust in his face.

""Here! The Kingdom Key!"" Sora chirped happily. 

Riku stared, dumbstruck.

""Um... Sora...""

""Oh you know, I have many keyblades! But this is the one most special to me. King Mickey has one too! Unless you want to see Oblivion? Oh, but you've already seen Oblivion! While fighting with Roxas and all, hehehe. Ummm what about the Wishing Lamp? I got that in Agrabah!"" Sora babbled on, seemingly oblivious to Riku's bland expression.

""It's really alright... Sora."" Riku intonated, trying to keep the disappointment out of his voice.

""Alright, if you say it is... are you okay, Riku?"" Sora's eyes, concerned now.

Riku nodded mutely. Then he got off, pulled on his shirt, and went to find Kairi.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
""...Riku, I said to be <i>obvious</i>."" Kairi said dryly after listening to Riku's woes. She had nearly choked on her paopu smoothie when she heard what Riku had told <i>Sora</i>, the most oblivious boy in the world. And as if that hadn't been bad enough, it just <i>had</i> to be some sexual innuendo too.

""Where did you learn <i>that</i> from, anyway?""

Riku flushed and turned away.

""It was DiZ... I mean, Ansem the Wise.""

Kairi choked on her smoothie."

<lj-cut text=""Sora ran"">Sora ran. He ran into the halls of the mansion in Twilight Town, then to the hidden underground laboratory where Ansem the Wise had kept Roxas in his virtual town. He would find Kairi and Riku again, no matter the cost!

That red-headed guy in the black Organization coat... Axel, was it? He had to know something. Sora would force him to tell him of Riku's whereabouts even if it killed him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A portal! How strange... nevertheless, Sora plunged into it without thinking, as all brainless heroes are wont to do. He ran forward mindlessly, leaving Donald and Goofy far behind in his pursuit of his long-lost friends... until he noticed a distinctly breathy moan.

""Oh, Roxas. Oh yes you're good, Rox-<i>ass</i>,"" a deep, sensual voice reverbated through the silence of Betwixt and Between. The voice belonged to a male. A certain <i>familiar</i> red-headed male as he was grinding his hips... into a dusk.

Sora's eyes widened. His throat grew dry. His cheeks became a very dark shade of red which should have only been seen on fruit. Then he screamed.

Axel jerked up in shock and turned to face Sora, then stared forward at the dusk he was straddling. A <i>dusk</i>.

""OH MY GOD ROXAS? WHAT???""

By that time, Sora had already fainted dead away."

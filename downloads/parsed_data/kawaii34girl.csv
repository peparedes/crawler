So yeah, I hope everyone else had a good time there.  I'm done talking.

"event","Well, today was fun.  It was like, -10 degrees out today.  But besides the brutal cold, today was a good day.  After church there was a dinner, lunch thingy.  (Becasue er baptists gatta have out food ^_~)  But it was a lot of fun, I sat with a really fun family, and it was just plain awesome!  So then after that, me and mom went shopping for the rest of my friends and stuff, I got mom the Celine Dion spray that she's been dieying to get, so I know that she'll be a happy camper this christmas ^^  On the 18th my youth group went Christmas shopping... that was fun too!  (wow... my life's been REALLY fun lately!!!!!)  But anyway, my Dad got me a necklace the other day, and it really means a lot, I haven't taken it off since he put it on me (and I don't plan on taking it off either!!!!!)  But uh.... Dad made mom open her gift from him about an hour ago... it was......a..... PRINTER with a scanner, copeyer, and a whole bunch of other awesome junk!!!!!  But anyway, I gatta go up-date ""My Otaku"".  (It's an AWESOME site... and I HIGHLY reccomend it to anime lovers out there!  you get you're own personal web-site, archives for art, archives for quizes and it has an AMAZING forum.  Man, I could just go on-and-on!  But since I'm guessing that all of you have better things to do with you're time, I won't ^^)

So yeah, my user-name is Kawaii34Girl (surprise, surprise)  But once I get my site under-way, I'll give yall a linkie ^^

Does anyone know the name of the song that they play for the commercial for ""Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories"".  I think it's the prettiest song ever!  I wanna hear the whole thing, so if u know the title, it would be a HUGE help to lemme know the title ^^

ttyl!  Love ya all!!!!!  Merry Christmas!!!

(speaking of that... is it just me... or does it not even feel like Christmas yet!?!?!  Even after putting the tree up, decorating it, the youth group shopping trip, wrapping presents, giving presents and all of that good stuff, it just doesn't seem like Christmas.  But I know that the night before, I'll get all eager, and then as soon as I finally feel in-season... it'll all be over.  Sad, eh?)

Well, life's been okay.  I don't think I could complain... too bad ^_~  But yeah, FF.net, looking up sites,  music, drawing, tracing (A City with no People from Chobits!  Yay for the bunnies!!!) and a few games at Neopets has made up my life. Fun fun!

I spent the night at Poki-chan and Clari-chan's house the other night, and that was fun!  We watched ""Dawn of the Dead"", read 2 new Chobits, drew and played DDR (even though they didn't have the mat!)

And that was my 1st time playing DDR.... so I wasn't very good, lol!  My friends decided that the song from there, ""Butterfly"" is my song.  Once I got home and looked up the lyrics, I realized that I had read a song-fic about it.  So that's awesome!

Well, I like somone... but I have no chances with him.  But then my ex was being a total sweetie.  I mean, he made me feel really good about myself, and I just felt really good when I was talking to him and stuff.  But then I remembered that he isn't a Christian, so I had to decline when he told me he loved me and asked me out.  MAN!  That was REALLY hard...

But a good friend from Life Changers came to visit me the day before Thanksgiving, and that was really special.  (Love-ya Nick!)  I g2g soon, so I'll explain that event later.

Well, I had 3 REALLY fun dreams last night!  They were really crazy, but some really good things happened!  And it was a LOT OF FUN!  I almost cried when I woke up.

But anyway, sorry for the lack of up-dates, I'll try to be better about that.

And I realized that I would be tested soon.  I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE THE NEXT DAY!!!!!  But yeah, I was just like, balling my eyes out in the car today.  I promised mydelf not to cry, I played Akeobishi: Wind over and over in my head.  But it broke at the stupidest remark in the world!!!!!

So yeah, I feel bad.  And just pray for me, and the whole patience and trusting God's plan.  And pray for the trials I've been facing lately.  Help me to not focus on it too much.  And yeah, thanks a lot!!!

Oh yeah!  And for the song, Everytime...  It fits my mood almost perfectly.  There are only about 3 sentances that don't apply to me.  But needless to say, this song has been playing on repeat for a LOOOOOOONG time now...  It was there at the event that crushed me most, and it's pretty, calming and it fits almost perfectly!  Too bad it's sung by Britney Spears, O-well!!!"

"event","Let's see, I'm sorry that I haven't up-dated in a few days.  I had stayed up all night when I last up-dated.  The next day, I went swimming, went to the park, went on a bike ride, went swimming again, went to the corner store and such.  So basicly, I was really busy and kept active.  That night, we went to eat at Grandma's house.  I felt...really...uncomfortable.  I'm not sure why, I just did.  then we went to Dad's friend's house.  His whife was very kind to me.  She was so complimentary and seemed so interested in what I had to say.  It felt good.  I was telling her about Life Changers, she's thinking about volunteering.

I went home and slept really well.  The next day was Sunday, I did NOT wanna get up.  But I eventuelly did.  I felt really self-aware at church.  **sigh**  I feel like I'm always putting this mask on when I'm at church.  I mean, the people are so kind to me.  I just sorta modify my personality so I'll fit in better.

A friend asked me if I would like to go put-putting, sounds great!  We went with her b/f and 2 other people in the youth group.  I felt like I was annoying  everyone.  Looking back at some of my actions, and some of the stupid things I said, it's no wonder I feel like a pest when the day is done.

I got home to an empty house.  I got on-line and started downloading Naruto music.  Then I started reading some FF's and drawing a picture of Haku.  I think it turned out rather well... if we ever get a scanner, I'll show u!

I loaded this one song from Naruto, and I was thinking about S****.  I went out-side in my yard and cut a rose.  It's now drying up-side down in my room.  Just a reminder that he doesn't like me now, but I'm okey.

Mom rented this movie, ""The Other Side of Heaven"".  It was really good.  I loved it.  It's one of those movies where you don't wanna see it, but you know in the end that you'll like it.

Today, I got up and started downloading more music and reading more FF's.  I got in contact with a friend from Life Changers, so that's pretty cool.  I've been listening to ""She Will be Loved"" by Maroon 5 a lot latley.  It just reminds my that someday, ""I Will be Loved"".  I guess that's all to catch up on!

Love u all!

"event","Hmmmmmmm.  **takes a bite of ice-cream**  Just thinking.  We just got done doing make-overs, lol.  I'm currently wearing make-up that makes my skin look flaw-less and some deeper eye treatment.  The eyes had different shares of brown.  She curled my eye lashes... YIKES!!!  (Has had BAD experiences with the eye-lash curler before...) When I was all done, everyone was surprised at how much older I looked.  My thoughts, I'll take it as a compliment.

I've always felt more drawn to the older crowd, even though I haven't the slighest clue why.  I'm young for my grade.  I'm entering my freshman year, and I'm going to turn 14 about a month after school starts.  nd yet everyone says that I look arouind 15ish.  Once again, I'll take it as a compliment.

It's hard to believe that I didn't even want to get an account here, and yet I've already written in it several times in one night.  I have a journal, but I haven't written in it for a little over a month.  I just don't feel comfortable, it's like so... so... so... so overeley...offocial looking.  I had filled up a small notebook-type-thingey my bobber within a few months.  It had soft green pages, and had Kermit on the cover.  I started every enterey as ""Dear Kermit,"".  I have to delete it every time I start it out like that here.  Towards the end, I would write numerous enteries a day.  But usually when I was bored or frusterated or hurt, or something like that ^^  So, you're gunna be hearing me complain a heck of a lot, but that's what I'm gunna use this for, a place to vent and get stuff off my chest.

I'm feeling really tired, I didn't sleep well last night.  (Due to the fact that I was sleeping on the floor...)  And I didn't sleep very well the night before that.  (Wed night, need I say more?)  And I just feel tired!  Well, even though it's 2: 49 now, We had stayed up till 9 in the morning... I stayed up until 9 in the morning... She fell asleep at 6!!!  I could go and explain all of that, but like I just got done saying, I'm tired.  I guess that's a story for another time!!!

But I just found out, that S**** honestly doesn't like me.  And in all honesty, I'm glad I know.  No more guessing games.  He doesn't like me.  And... I'm hurt, but not mad.  I'm not mad aaat him, it's not his fault he doesn't like me.  It's not the girl who blabbed, it's not any of those people.  Usually, I would turn to myself. But I did nothing wrong.  Okey, maybe I did get annoying somewhat, but not as bad as Sakura!!!!!  But, I wish with all of my heart that he liked me back.  But there is nothing that anyone can do about it.  I'm so greatfull that I know the truth, Ashley... I can never thank-you enough.

And even through all the mess, I still like him. He was never went out of his way for me, he never comforted me, we never spoke to me and stuff, but ya know what, that's fine.  I STILL LOVE YOU S****!!!!!!

"event","4 of my friends convinced me to get this, so I did.  **thinks**  Hmmm, I better not do that, I got hurt the last time I tried ^^

Everytime I think about a cerntain event, I get goosebumps and instantly have to listen to a song to keep me from crying.  (The song is Wind from Naruto, good song!)  Well, what happened is that me and a bunch of people from the youthgroup went ahead and decided to go to the movies.  Everyone knows that I have a crush on S****.  And we went to see The Village.  (Cruddy movie, it's not worth ur time)

His older brother, and nearley everyone else in the Youth Group (that was at the movies) was plotting to get S**** to sit next to me.  The out-come was that he was next to me.  But he wasn't happy about.  I hae had a crush on him for quite awhile now, and it hurts to think that he dislikes me that much.  I heard that he may have of even swore that he didn't wanna be near me.

It makes me feel good that everyone was soooo willing to get S**** near me, and that they were actuelly helping.  It means a lot.  Well, **giggle**  at least I know that his older brother approves of me.

Well, I spent the night at my friends house last night, and now I'm at my OTHER friends house.  I'm glad that I'm busy though.  I haad nightmares on Wed night, and it took me forever to get even that pathetic and so-called sleep.  It really helped for the distraction of friends.

On Thursday, I was just playing Wind over and over (paying special attention to the lines ""Don't cry, cuz you're so alright"") as well as wrapping a blanket around me to try and chase away th goose-bumps.  **sigh**  I think that they don't have Wind on their computer anymore, so I can only immagine the song running through my head.

Wow... now I seem like some dork!  For those of you who know me, you know that this is not normally how I am.  I'm just hitting a ruff spot!

I love you all with the love that he will never give me,

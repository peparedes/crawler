ms kwan:
someone has to say it. every time i watch the show and she appears, the phrase ""And the Worst Acting Ever Award goes to. . ."" goes off in my mind.
Really, i'm sure she's a very nice person, but her acting is beyond dreadful. It's coarse, fake, shallow, rudimentary, and extremely extremely lacking in any depth whatsoever. 
whoever cast her should be shot. I mean, did NO one else audition for the part?
again, this is about her acting on Degrassi & not her as a person."

""They still held him."" She realized that now.
Captive of an indeterminate prison, he almost stood no chance.

The room stood pitch, but she knew what awaited her. 
She knew he awaited her. 
Not even knowing, yet pleading to be let free.

But whom, or why, she couldn't yet devise.

He could only speak in riddles to remind her of his presence.
Yet she felt them more exactly as soul shaking danger signals as to what would happen if she couldn't reach him in time.

In time for what?

With the hood of her cloak worn low on her brow, the only light seemed to be radiating through
the steadfast yet deeply frightened lady's eyes.

The knife in one hand.  The note in the other,
Lightly clenched, just enough for rough wind to shake her constitution.
Blessedly, the room was still. (But was that him crying or was it her?)
She ventured on.

""Odd, the room smells of Nothing,"" she thought.
Her foot banged into an object fixed to the floor.
Without a sound, a ceiling trap opened & beaming moonlight drove directly overhead.
Blinking back to adjust, she saw the end.
She stood before an average chair.  Above that, a noose.
She clenched the note tighter this time.

With utmost resolution she shook her head.

""No!"" She shouted, craining her neck to the open shaft.
""No! Not this time! I've fought worse! I tried it your way! Why-What else do you ask of me?
No more pain! I have no more to offer you! You have won!""
Barely audible,
She choked back a sob. ""We are innocent.""
Nothing.
""Let him go.""

Another spotlight clicked on to her right. She turned.
It was him. Naked and huddled. But not shaking.

Everything in her told her to run to him. But, mouth agape, she stood immobile.

It was all over for them. He knew that now.
Yet, staring as intently as they were at each other, They both knew something that no one else could ever grasp.

She smiled faintly at him now, turned back and stepped on the chair. She pulled the noose around her neck and jumped. The paper from her outstretched dying hand fluttered to the floor. 
The knife remained in her other hand.

Soon, her twisting ceased. Her body cast an elegant shadow.
The knife pointed directly towards Hades.

The room no longer smelt of Nothing.
There was a strange twinge of Hope.

                   ""I never was stranger to you.
                    you know me now, still
                    the knowledge of an old world
                    Reminds me you are near.

                    dance, mon ange
                    in the despairing moonlight
                    I will always fight for you
                    'till breath has left my side

                    A note that reads:
                    'You have slain me.
                    You have exquisitely
                    ruined my life.""

He closed his beautiful eyes and smiled contentedly, his flesh rotting away.
He had finished humming.

The lights over both bodies have been shut off.
The song is all but forgotten.
Now and then, you could hear the crows."

Holy Fucking Rock.

Went to the salon right before and got a fierce punk-ish yet glammy look.

I looked SofuckingHot last night. 
mike and i had a blastaroo! i saw jerry and his gf and their posse. alexis, of all people, and her posse. i just saw a lot of people i haven't seen or heard from in ages, it was nice.
but wierd, cause, you know, when i moved out here, one of the major perks was that i didn't know anyone. I mean, it was lonely and sucky, but it was a perk nonetheless.
Ok, well, the show was a religious experience. Like, i felt like how maybe you're supposed to feel after a major blissfully euphoric state of being. i had two strawberry daquris and some people in the row in front of us were smoking the doobage. it was rank, but i got a wicked contact high. 
picked up an autographed Bauhaus cd. sweet. we got cool seats. it was in the center and just close enough not to get sweated on and just far enough away to feel a great breeze when we needed to. blissfully perfect weather. ~sigh~ i FINALLY got to see bauhaus. wicked.

sushi tuesday night with smiling nazi. *He is dating entirely too much in my opinion* And then telling me about it. He called yesterday to ask my advice for how to answer the online questions of this 27-year old gorgeous attorney from manhattan who travels the world and is 'very outdoorsy'. Anyone else feel inadequate? 
Then went to an uber swank bar with dark purple colors and a nyc-vibe. just us and the bar tender. she was cute. to me, he didn't really think so. talked personal history. I'm kinda getting sick of him. Like, case-in-point, he invites ME out for sushi. so i drive to his place, then he pretty much tried to guilt trip me out in to driving with this pathetic limp, it failed, he drove. But then the check came and it REALLY seemed like mike was expecting me to pay. HA! I took out my half and said, ""are we going dutch or what?"" That, and the fact he is dating like a loon. 
 Two dating sites and now this 20 year old in hawthorne named laura who reminds me of dana/danielle h. Let me tell YOU how much i think THAT's a great idea. I want him to be happy and settle down like he's all saying he really wants too, but c'MON! 
on the way to Nazi M's, i thought i saw mike g. But i found out later it was Tom.

After class tuesday, i got rear-ended.
My car did, smartass, when i was in it.

my back still hurts

but i did have a dream about a week ago that a non-sexual non scary vamp bit my neck while i was sleeping, and when i woke up, the right side of my neck to about my shoulder hurt.

So my sub-conscious knew i put something outta whack, but Me, awake, didn't.

working more, playing more. Saturday, worked an awful long shift, came home, made a birthday card. Monika's 31st birthday party was saturday. I went. We hadn't seen each other for a year. Everyone was at least 30. Most were married and brought their kids. Yeah. I belonged. Not. 
Had a beer, homemade Polish food, and good champagne. Nice. Got hit on by married dudes who were drunk and trying to piss off their wives. Nice. More like, super Icky. Oh right, my ex-boss from Barnes and Noble was there. (her husband reminded me of the ""nice smart little chinese boy"" i went to highschool with, you know, the one who grows up to be this fantastic AssHole?) Awesome. I don't think she really remembered me, but c'mon, how many ""Roya's"" could she have hired in the past year?
So tired, i called kevin back after i realized i was going to be the butt of the ""she's the youngest and strangest looking one here, let's be pricks"" jokes at the party/get together for people who are REALLY BORING. Anyway, kev and i talked, realized lauren and co. would be doing something later(i've been hanging out with her again, WEE!!! ~smiles~) and i was like, ok, call me when that shit all goes down. 
Yeah, so i got home and sooo tucker'd out by the days events (and i think, the champagne) i fell asleep. Got about 80 voicemails asking where the fuck i was. yeah, should probably return a few of those. Nah.
And why did EveryonE call me Saturday? I mean, WTF? Payday is FRIDAY, you dumbfucks. I felt all loved and popular and then sunday morning, NOTHING. You all suck. 

At least i got in a sober conversation with jon before i left for monika's.

Today, i get an extra shift at work. That enough of an update for you?

ESPECIALLY walking around nyc where there are fjords and bottomless moats everywhere and the cabs make a game of hitting these ""puddles""(ha.) to splash the already bone-soaked pedestrians. Yeah, it sucked. AND Trig is directionally challenged. I got to meet this cool hippie, though. he was funny. very stoned. Soooo we finally got a cab after walking for about an hour in the hellish piss storm. yeah, we were late but the films were really worth it. Here boys, I'm plugging ya:

www.nothingmanfilms.com

got to see the last half of ""John Mellon"". which is really too hilarious for words. this guy goes on an office killing spree and all his co-workers are watermellons. it's very Atom-film. but really funny.

But wow and a half, ""Cunnigula"" is fucking great. Armed with a not yet released sleep inducer(SOM-Patch), man goes on a blind cunnilingus rampage on the women in the city. all the usual, um, exploits ensue. And some that you really wish didn't. I haven't laughed that hard in a while. I swear to god, John Trigonis is an AMAZING writer. I barely recognized the lead actor, and i've met him a few times before. soo, that was hilarious. 

Nina, you'll love this...remember that cool looking theatre in the village advertising that doc about Judy Garland in front? yeah, that's where these two gems debuted. wicked, right? 
yeah, would've if the rain wasn't pouring in buckets.

anyway, since i took the path (path train) from jersey city, and 'tricia parked elsewhere...it was around midnite when i made it back to my car. i don't like jersey city when i'm alone at night....it's sccaarrryyy. Still pissed we couldn't have just met in the village and took a cab to the random address trigonis gave. ~anyway~ life goes on."

Hey boy! where did I fail in giving you inaction? your style is hardly striking. A 1960's cry-for-help. or is that plagiary? yeah. . .that. And the 13 dollars in your precociously torn jean's pocket. how much more will you steal from women before all the men dick you over too? how i wish i could take back all the apologies i made for thinking you were worthless the first time. I ran 42 city blocks and you still kissed my ass. how IS my ex? I know she's a virgin. don't worry. she fucked me up first. 10 years from the day I last regret talking to you will I be ready to see you tell me you missed all our conversations and my company. you really did know me better than anyone. so why did you fail so miserably at being human? I do miss the old you. stealing spoons and giving me a scary drive up a step hill, icy in your death-trap truck on my birthday. I should have probably identified you as what you are: an ass in sheep's clothing. 
My one true love? you can't possibly live up to the image i have forsaken lovers and tormented myself with of you. swimming blond in that frozen river in my head. if i saw you today, it would probably ruin it. your simple name. your simple heart. 
My oldest friend? don't worry. I never wanted to ruin it. daisy fields in a city with raining hypocrites far from both of us. I have known you & been remembered too long. Your ebony skin is a constant reminder of beauty. thank you for you. a saving grace in this haphazard wasteland. 
I barely remember you. and i wish i could. you looked good in my jewlery and my optimism. a teenage Adonis. still in love with Magic. . .gathering groupies wasn't your forte. i've always coveted the underdog. that was the last pure memory of a crush i ever had. . .blue eyes almost see-through. 
The one night stand, presidential suite of a 2-star hotel. . .I'm stuck, 15 years old and covered in postage stamps. they were only 29 cents then. stupid football player with stupid green eyes and sandy hair that blinded me and taught me what tounges are for. Must be why i loathe myself in khakis. 
I wrote you letters. You wrote lies. because we were 12 and the only ones stranded and not interested in suicide yet. But drug lords captured your bishop even though i was your Brunette Virgin Queen. not yet defiled and almost completely brainwashed. too bad i never really knew you. did you finally change your name back? 
And you boring boy, I did give my heart only to you. I really never gave you enough credit for slowing me down. you called me graceful, i called it clumsy. the sky was blue. too dull to rain. all we needed was a good wash-out. call it a day. you called yourself a monster yesterday. please believe i forgive you and not myself. about yesterday. . .you never scared me, only made me scare myself. i don't want to be like our parents. these are charred memories of lilies and the notion that you forgot I've never pierced my ears. 
More neglect than I've patience for. Possibly Maybe, at any rate. 
Thanks for letting me fall on my face, for you. when i think of home, i have you. when i remember life. i can forget you. and your name. because that's apparently all i have now. a shoebox with your name all over it."

i know i'm not depressed. but i'm not really in that tier known as happyness either. God, i love the cars. 

oohh. oh! so i went to my friend tiffany's b-day party in jersey city last night. she's actually punk rock. regardless of whatever definition you're using. and her ""friends"", while sweet as hell and nice, are fucking pretentious as all get out. the topics were actually ""punk rock politics"". yea.

needless to say i was choking on the irony.

and i'll tell you why. it's so sad, really. this one guy was really an educated guy, and this other girl was young but full of sweet naivete, i really hope she never loses that. one of tiffany's other friends reminded me of nina. like, she looks like how i remember nina looks close up. but i REALLY wanted to punch this girl in the face. she wouldn't let anyone get a word in, and then was really something of a. . . know-it-all? even though she didn't know very much of anything. which, thankfully, someone besides me called her on. i mean, i did say, i didn't think she knew what she was talking about. because, um, she didn't. she was also one of those people who takes credit for EVERYTHING, and then really violates people's personal space, like, she would talk IN YOUR FACE and AT you, instead of TO you. maybe she was drunk. anyway. i did, however, meet this older(like, i think everyone was around 24) couple, maybe mid-thirties, couple. who, i happen to think, have been living the punk life. drunk, happy, and damning the man. go figure. she could dance and had the fucking best attitude. telling this one guy to shut up and laughing at everyone, with everyone...same thing. i'm glad there are people like her out there.  everyone was all anti this, anti that...and some good points were made but i thought it was hilarious that i was hanging out with people i thought had a clue. but realized they are just as mentally deficient as the people i talk to on a daily basis. Like, the whole scene reminded me of a set from SLC punk. maybe it was the lighting, i don't know. the fact that they were equally as pretentious as the Hot topic crew kinda leveled out the playing field for me. i think i'm going hang out with just hip hop people now. they seem to be the most friendly. and if you are stupid to them, they are at least willing to teach. without making you feel like a moron.

It has the unmistakable stench of a lie. Maybe for all the hard times, grand times, the times where you fell and fended off imaginary demons. You lonely little liar. de-pantsed and depraved. starving, blindly for attention. all those women to straighten you out. all those stupid songs you pretend to know. safe from the wintry burning. lessening the salt waves crashing about and wounding no one. 
Black merriweathers fluster because I invited you in for more than entertainment. Mother Specter from the third apocalypse; I am shrinking, drinking in more pain than tolerable. Miserable, putting my hands to my face, scratching trenches so the short salt tears will burn bloody in effigy. a reminder that ""nothing means anything"". A disastrous mourner, dark lonesome angels hiding. In times of rationale; it's all over for you. The End- the deep end, the living end, the bitter end. You with your sickening sticky sweet words that pronounce less than rudimentarly you have nothing interesting to say. you toss around emotions like a dog and his bowel movements, and even he has a sense of loyalty. Dancing around half truths that you are half ready to be a good person. shivering from death, memorized metamorphosis. staring up because ""some people don't deserve to get diseased."" but, honey, you do. Things happen at the right time for you, or they're meaningless-just like you. It's a beautiful freedom that nothing's more clever than getting kicked in the teeth. Almost as bad for me as those damn cookies that pock your face and soul. black & white
-and- split just like your personality. And When you are ready? 
Anytime you feel wonderful, remember me. 
When you see what makes you smile. . . - Remember, ""For you, everything.""
A division of time between the here -and- the now
drunken admissions of well wishings.
Excuse me for not having Myself memorized. I Never promised promiscuity. 
How's that right hand doing?
At least you're happy.

right?

so, it's kinda late, i've got a mad headache and yet i'm on the computer typing shit.
the smoke from the club tonight is killing me even though i contributed a little. not really, i could barely finish one cig. anyway.

I just want to say something about yesterday. Fuck pat jarrett. I want him dead.  

Quit talking to me like i owe you something or that we're still friends. we're not. get over it. get over yourself. YOU fucked up this friendship. You did. you with some chick i was friends with 3 years ago has nothing to do with why i think you suck. if it's on the list, it's way the fuck at the bottom. I hate you because you suck. you're not worth me describing all the vast ways and reasons why you suck, and i do know lots of nice big $10 words. all the best wishes for your career. you've got the stuff, kid. But i fucking want you dead you worthless cunt. 

Fuck pat jarrett. I want him dead.
Thank you.

that concludes our public service announcement."

xIvoryDreamerx: (ok...where did we off then?)
xVilondra: (Oh, I've read it from your LJ.)
xIvoryDreamerx: lol
xIvoryDreamerx: ok...
xVilondra: Isabel: She turned her head, looking disgusted. ""I'm gonna sit down now."" She said lightly, taking her seat right behind Michael.
xIvoryDreamerx: (You read my last Liz post?)
xVilondra: (um...)
xVilondra: (I posted last for Max)
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She looked down at her test, her pencil tapping slightly the edge of her desk. She furrowed her brow slightly. Let's get to work.
xVilondra: Isabel: She looked down at the test with a sigh, biting the end of her pencil. She poked Michael in the the back with it, grinning softly, then started writing the answer to the first problem.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He smiled at Isabel as she sat down. Bam! He jumped. The teacher stood in front of him. He had slammed the test on top of the desk. Michael smiled cheekily at the teacher, reaching for the test. 
xIvoryDreamerx: (you posted for isabel twice)
xVilondra: (did I? hum...)
xIvoryDreamerx: (just post for Max , and I'll post for michael again after Liz)
xVilondra: (Oh! Rozzy's on. I'm so glad I recorded it. Plus, meh parents are home and they're putting a little time limit on my internets ness, I've got to go! I'll be back on later.)
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She doted her 'i's, crossed her 't's, and smiled to herself as she looked down at her finished test paper. Liz stood and breezed past the furiously working students, tapping Maria on the head with her pencil as she passed, just because she could. Liz layed her papers in the bin lightly, the first ones. She smiled at the teacher impersonally and floated back to her seat, daring a smile at max as she sat.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He jumped slightly, turning to look with raised eyebrows at Isabel. Michael wrinkled his nose at her and stuck out his tongue.
xVilondra signed on at 3:22:21 PM. 
xIvoryDreamerx: (are you alive?)
xVilondra: Max: He finished his test easily and handed it in, then returned a grin to Liz. God, she was beautiful...
xIvoryDreamerx: (aww....)
xVilondra: Isabel: She mirrored his look with her own, grinning as she stuck her tongue out. Looking back to her paper-then the teacher to make sure he wasn't watching Michael and her, she leaned forward just enough so that their tongues would meet, careful to make it look accidental.
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She blushed a little. Thankfully the blush had faded in the mad rush to the doors, but now it was back in full force. Damn pale skin.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He jerked, a little electric shock shaking his body. His eyes widened. Wow. He shook his head slightly. He hadn't expected that. It was...nice. And God help him, he wanted more. He turned away from her, focusing on his test. no. Isabel. Sister. Isabel. He scribbled a bit on his test, trying not to look at Isabel. After a while he looked down at what he wrote. Isabel. ""Damn it!"" He swore, balling the paper wad up.  he closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. Michael took another sheet of paper from the desk, just able to reach it without getting up. He started over. Today was not a good day so far.
xIvoryDreamerx: (hello hello hello)
xVilondra: Isabel: She smirked slightly, in spite of herself liking the way he reacted. Finishing her test, she got up and made sure to brush her hip against him as she went to give the teacher the paper.
xVilondra: (oh, hold your non-existent horses!)
xVilondra: Max: Her cheeks were nice. Flushed like that. Wait? Had he done that...? Not possible. He stood and grabbed his book bag, waiting for her.
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She smiled up at Max. He was so sweet. her eyes widened. Why was he waiting? Unless...Liz smiled brilliantly, grabbing her huge backpack and zipping her binder. She pushed a couple books inside the bag before resigning herself to carrying half of them. She stood, manuevering around the chair to stand beside Max. She smiled up at him, pushing a wave of hair behind one ear.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He stood triumphantly as he finished the test, just as Isabel brushed past. He shivered slightly. The bell rang just as he layed his test on top. Smiling, he turned, bumping right into Isabel. This time he caught her with his arms, keeping her up. ""Looks like I just keep running into you"" He said with a smile."

"event","xIvoryDreamerx: (as now begins the RPG)
xIvoryDreamerx: Our Way or the Highway
xVilondra: ok
xVilondra: you start ^^
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She sighed, hugging her books tighter to her chest. She glanced over to Maria, who was rummaging through her locker, rattling about her latest ex-boyfriend. Liz rolled her eyes. It wasn't that she didn't love Maria like a sister - minus the subling fights, it was just that sometimes Maria could go off in her own little world and forget Liz was still back on Planet Earth. Liz suddenly stood up straight, her eyes locked to the dark figure gliding across her vision. Max Evans. Hottie of the school. Totally untouchable, but drool worthy. ""Hey! Liz? Liz?!"" Liz came to with a start. Maria had closed her locker sometime, and now she stood in front of her, snapping her fingers in her face. Liz shook her head a bit, focusing on Maria. ""W-What? Sorry Maria, wasn't listening""
xIvoryDreamerx: (Maria and all characters that aren't ours are free game...like, I can be Maria, you can be Maria...whatever suits our purpose)
xVilondra: (righty-o)
xVilondra: Isabel: She turned a corner swiftly, moving up to her brother with her usual pattern of elegance. Her eyes were bright, lined with a deep black to match her ""Well"" fitting shirt. She wore rather simple blue jeans, tucked into knee-high leather boots. As usual, her hair fell down her back like a blonde waterfall. Yeah. Isabel Evans was all about perfection. ""Hey, Max.""
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She wrinkled her nose at Maria as Maria did a ""Poor Me"" look. She glanced over at max, but he was in deep conversation with some girl. She looked familiar...Liz shook her head, dragging her gaze from Max. No use longing over somehting you couldn't have. Liz flicked a strand of raven hair from her face, directing her full attention at Maria. She turned towards her, composing her face, with difficulty, into an open, interested expression.
xIvoryDreamerx: Max: ""Hey Isabel"" he said distractedly. His gaze flickered to the left for a second, then he looked back at her. 
xIvoryDreamerx: (ack, SHORTNESS)
xVilondra: Isabel: ""Hey...Liz Parker's looking at you!"" She flashed him one of her brilliant grins. ""You've gotta go talk to her."" She placed a hand gently on his shoulder and proceeded to push him slightly.
xIvoryDreamerx: (ahem...Maria, pleaseness?)
xIvoryDreamerx: (ok, you be Max right now, I'll be Maria)
xVilondra: (um...no...I'm not really in a Max mood...heh, sorry)
xVilondra: (actually, nm)
xVilondra: (I'll be Max.)
xIvoryDreamerx: (argh, i can't be max talking to Me1)
xIvoryDreamerx: (lol, sacrifices :p)
xVilondra: Max: ""Iz...."" He sighed and she only pushed at him harder. ""Ok!"" He started over towards Liz, lookign slightly nervous. He looked down, shoving his hands in his pockets. What was he supposed to say? ""Hi."" Well, not James Bond-ish, but it would do.
xVilondra: (You be Michael! Pwease. And how about...they don't know he's an alien? Like, they haven't even met yet?)
xIvoryDreamerx: Maria: She stared at liz until she looked at her, then opened her mouth wide to, well, Liz never found out, because suddenly she gapsed. Maria pushed Liz against a locker, so her own back was towards the hall. ""Liz"" She said, her eyes wide ""Max Evans is walking right towards us!"" Liz stared at maria, then started to look behind her. Maria tightened her grip on Liz ""Don't look at him"" She said quietly. Liz nodded slightly, then, nonchalantly, she glanced around maria. Eep! Maria looked around curiously. Max Evans stood about 2 feet away. ""Hi."" Maria turned back to Liz, and pushed her around her slightly. Once Liz stood facing Max, Maria crept a little to the sidegiving Liz a LOOK.
xIvoryDreamerx: (Oh, come one! We have to start the episode/episodes like they strated it, except we direct it diferently)
xVilondra signed on at 2:51:51 PM. 
xVilondra: (I'll wait for your Michael post...I'm kinda busy, so that gives me more time! yay! ^^)
xIvoryDreamerx: (Like Cliffhangers, just let's not mess it up to much)
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He started down the hallway, his eyes to the floor. ""x squared plus y2 divided by mt"" He muttered to himself, headed towards Math. Suddenly a pair of leather boots filled his vision. ""Hey Isabel he said, then made a move to go around her
xVilondra: (What?)
xIvoryDreamerx: (We have to start the episode/episodes like they strated it, except we direct it diferently)
xIvoryDreamerx: (because then we'll mess it up to much)
xVilondra: Isabel: She turned slightly and there he was. Michael Guerin. ""Heya."" She replied, flashing him a grin. ""Where are you going so fast?
xVilondra: (ok)
xVilondra: (brb(
xIvoryDreamerx: (k)
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She smiled nervously at Max, her fingers playing with a stray tassle hanging off her books. ""Hey max"" She said, her voice coming out normal. Thank You for small things. She smiled at him, glancing down at her feet before forcing ehrself to look back up at him.
xIvoryDreamerx: Maria: She smiled slightly at Liz, then, mouthing ""I'll meet you there"", She headed off towards Math, a little happy bounce to her step.
xVilondra: Max: His hands dug intoh is pockets kind of nervously. ""Um, Liz. Hey. You're in my chem class.""
xIvoryDreamerx: (so much shortness)
xVilondra: (neh...it's long enough)
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She nodded her head slightly. ""Ya...Umm, you sit across from me"". She nodded a little, then made herself stop as she was getting dizzy.  Liz bit her lip as silence fell. Do it do it do it. ""So, umm, you sit across from me, right?"". Coward. 
xVilondra: (it's your post for both of them...)
xVilondra signed on at 3:04:20 PM. 
xVilondra: (-poke-)
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He looked isabel full in the face, his mind still racing with math problems. ""Math test."" he said absently, as if that explained it all. 
xIvoryDreamerx: (more shortness...but it's your fault, because you distracted me with your poking1)
xIvoryDreamerx: (by the way...*poke*)
xVilondra: ""Oh."" She nodded, grinning. ""Poor Guerin."" She brushed a lock of hair from her face and sighed. Then, she fixed Michael's hair for him. Such a perfectionist.
xVilondra: (ah, pokeness!)
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He looked at Isabel, a half shicked, half surprised expression on his face. ""Umm, ya, thanks"" He said, shaking his head a little as her hands left his hair. The spikes stayed up, though only because he had emptied the gel bottle this morning. His mind recoiled from that moment, that memory. He shook his head, dragging his mind from the pain... 
xVilondra: ""You okay?"" Isabel asked, immeadiately concerned at the strange look in his eyes. (ack, short)
xIvoryDreamerx: (Max?)
xVilondra: (you didn't post for Liz)
xIvoryDreamerx: (yes i did)
xVilondra: (um....repost it pwease?)
xIvoryDreamerx: xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She nodded her head slightly. ""Ya...Umm, you sit across from me"". She nodded a little, then made herself stop as she was getting dizzy.  Liz bit her lip as silence fell. Do it do it do it. ""So, umm, you sit across from me, right?"". Coward. 
xIvoryDreamerx: (since you said pwease...)
xVilondra: (^^)
xVilondra: ""Yep."" Max smiled at her, nervously. God, this girl made him feel like butter. ""I do. You're...really good at it. I'm hopeless.""
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She looked down again, her smile growing wider. She felt heat begining to creep up her cheeks. Damn it. She always was so suscuptable to blushing. Liz hugged her books tighter to her for no particular reason, comfort she guessed. ""Chemistry's my next class, after math that is""
 She said. Do it. Do it. ""It's my - our last period"" She felt her cheeks flame as she said ""our"". Damn it. It wasn't helping.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He looked away abruptly. ""I've got to go"" He said, not looking at her. He started off as the bell rang, making a beeline for the open class door.
xVilondra: ""Michael..."" Isabel sighed. ""Math is in G-9 today! Tsk tsk."" She shook her head. ""I have it too, remember?"" She moved towards him. ""Come on.  I'll make sure ya don't loose your way."" She gently patted is head (much in the way Tess did to Kyle)
xVilondra: Max: He gulped, trying to regain control. His own cheeks flamed slightly as he looked into her beautiful, intelligent eyes.  ""Yeah.""
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She took a shaky breath, staring deep into those chocolate pools he had as eeys. She could just drown within them...Liz jumped slightly as the bell rang. She knew her cheeks must be a flaming red. She looked away from those mesmorizing eyes. ""Th - That's my class."" She stuttered, heading down the hallway. She slid past Max, trying not to brush up against him as she passed. Her hip bumped against his, causing an electric tingle to go up her leg. She gasped slightly.
xVilondra: Max: His intake of breath was sharp as she brushed against him, and he fumbed with his books slightly, trying to regain composure. ""Um...yeah...my class too...math, right?""
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He furrowed his brow at Isabel. ""G-9?"" That's across the school. ""Aww, sh-"" He didn't get to finish his sentence, he started running past Isabel. It was only about 10 feet later that he stopped, turning to gesture at sabel hurriedly. ""Come on!"" He yelled in a stage whisper. He couldn't miss this test, if he did then he flunked Algebra.
xVilondra: Isabel raised her brow. "" Guerin, you're not going to see me run wearing this shirt."" She rolled her eyes slightly, and started after him, walking fast.
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She glanced at him, her eyes going a deep, almost black turn of brown. ""Ya"" She said shakily. She had forgotten. Just one look at him and all her thoughts fled her head. A scuffing to her right made her turn her head, showing some boy she didn't know half way down the hallway make a sharp turn, nearly spilling himself onto the floor. He held his hand oput to the girl max had been talking to. Max...She turned her gaze back to him. Wait. ""Oh!"" She gasped. Math - G9! Liz grabbed Max's hand, and started to run towards the corridor. ""Math's in G9 today!"" She said in way of explanation. 
xVilondra: A shudder, electricity pulsed through him when she touched him. When she held his hand as they moved through the hall very quickly. He could see his sister and Michael- Michael being the one rushing, Isabel being the one rolling her eyes-typical.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He rolled his eyes and made a grab for Isabel's hand, tugging it down the hallway. Isabel had a choice between running, and falling onto the floor, and Michael didn't wait to see what she'd choose. He started off towards the classroom, a teacher's voice yelling at them to walk trailing behind him.
xVilondra: ""Michael!"" Okay, she'd have to rethink her outfits if she was going to continue walking with Michael. Ouch. She stumbled a bit as she kept pace with him, but had soon tugged out of his grip and slowed her pace.
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She saw the boy pulling towards the classroom. Oh, right, that's where she remembered them from - Math. She paused as A teacher called out to them, wincing slightly. Choices, choices. A. Wait and let the teacher yell at them for running. B. Keep on running and maybe, maybe get to the class on time. She kept running
xVilondra: Max: He had to work to keep pace with her. He didn't quite want to burst on in full stride, as it would look a little weird.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He stumbled a bit when Isabel tugged out of his hand, barely keeping on his feet. He glanced back at Isabel, then to the Math door. The teacher was apssing out the test papers right now. He sprinted for the door. Isabel was a big girl, she could take care of herself.
xVilondra: (big girl? xD She is...though...in more ways than one xD Sorry...just had to say it.)
xVilondra: Isabel sighed heavily, moving at a brisk pace after Michael. The teacher would forgive her for being a couple minutes late, right?
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She tugged again inpatiently as Max stayed at a slower pace. Damn stubborn... She turned and aimed a glare at him. She didn't bother to speak, as she could barely breathe from the running. Liz's eyes widened as the door started to close. She darted through to her seat at the back of the class. Being a goodie goodie had it's advantages - teachers trusted you enough to put you in the back.
xVilondra: Max recieved the glare and quickened his pace. Yeah. Goodie-goodie. But it was cute. He sat two seat away from her, being an honors student himself.
xIvoryDreamerx: Michael: He slid through the door just as it slammed shut. Unfortunately, the teacher had long ago moved him to the front of the class. He crept into his seat, ignoring the look the teacher gave to him. He sat down quickly, his eyes down at his desk. Only then did he realize that the door had closed while Isabel was still outside.
xIvoryDreamerx: (hehe...sorry, I couldn't resist!!!)
xVilondra: (lol, s'okay.)
xVilondra: Isabel saw the door close and pursed her lips, quickly fixing her hair. Hell, this oughta be simple to get out off. It was a perveted male teachers. (xD couldn't resist that.) She opened the door. ""I'm sorry Mr. Green."" She said in her sweet-innocent-voice. ""My other class was at the entirely other end of the school. I went as fast as I could.""
xIvoryDreamerx: Liz: She smiled at the teacher as she recieved her test. Normally she would have said 'good morning', but she still could barely breathe from running, so she just counted her blessings at his blindness to anything bad about her (not that there was much). She glanced at Max as he burst through behind her, sharing a small, secret smile at him. tehjy had made it.
xIvoryDreamerx: ( I am NOT playing a perverted teacher)
xVilondra: (lol)  Max flashed a smile back and then recieved his test. He watched his sister come into the classroom with that practiced smile and rolled his eyes slightly.
xVilondra signed on at 3:54:21 PM.

Still though...I have 2 more days to go...as well as 3 tests and 2 essays. Oh yay. Gotta love being advanced. Isabelle and Caitlin will understand that last comment. Anyway. on to write my boring essays. Fun fun fun. but to occupy your time...you guessed it...

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/I/icemagick/1099583939_resselkie2.JPG"" border=""0"" alt=""selkie""><br>The Scottish selkie was a being who appeared to be<br>a seal, but had the ability to shed their skin<br>and roam the land in human form. If a human<br>were to happen upon the discarded seal skin, he<br>or she could hide it and force the selkie to<br>marry him or her. However, if the selkie were<br>to ever find the skin, he or she would<br>immediately reassume seal form and return to<br>the sea from whence they came, leaving their<br>spouse and offspring on land to forever mourn<br>their loss.

As a selkie, you are a very withdrawn, secretive<br>and somewhat sad person, and those around you<br>find you alluring and mystifying. People who<br>come into your life find it difficult to find<br>the inner you. You are also curious, but you<br>enjoy the comforts of home most of all.

"event","The weirdest thing happened to me while I was taking a quiz (on Quizilla).Ok, by now you should all know my obsession with Johny Depp. Duh. So, I was taking a quiz labeled:

^^_*Which Hollywood hunk is 4 u?*_^^(with sexy pics) 4 new added

ANd I thought, why not? So I clicked it, without a thought of johnny Depp (I am ashamed). Anyway, all through while I was taking it, there was no thought of Mr. Depp to influence my answers. None! Well, there was this one question, between: rugged and sexy OR cleancut (sometimes) and hot
But that was my only thought of him I swear! SO I finished and clicked the results and...

ARGH! Well, i got Johnny Depp, and for some stupid reason it won't copy here! but basically it was a hot picture of Johnny Depp (aren't all his pictures hot?) and it said: 
Johnny Depp- now this man is the most sexiest man alive, well done you chose well. there u go swoon over your man plz rate me thanx :D x msg me if u like your result or not (i love this cute pic)

If it would show, then, Yes. Well, anyway, Wow. I'M SO HAPPY! WOW! And it's real!!! Because I didn't influence the answers at ALL! Wow..."

in Mystery. Captivating, mysterious and alone. You<br>are the girl in the little
black number that no one seems to know, the eternal<br>mystery girl. You make it a
point to never let anyone know more about you than<br>you want them to and do a
very good job of it. You're there one minute and<br>gone the next leaving them in
wonder of who you really are. A mature and normally<br>calm individual, quiet and
enjoy spending many hours of the day on your own,<br>most likely preferring night
to day . You love the dark and some may find you a<br>bit strange. You seem to be
rather distant and cold making hard for people to<br>get close to you, though you
probably like the distance they usually keep. You<br>probably wear make-up, but
concentrate more around your eyes than anything.<br>You know the effect you have
and enjoy keeping people in wonder.</p>

Well, I think I've overused this quiz...so...now I need to find a new one...oh, ya. God, social studies is now the highlight of my day. It's sad, but true. My teacher's FUNNY lol. Ya, well, I already did this whole post on him...ya...well, that was my day."

"event","Well, this is my second steady journal entry...so...ya. Ooh, my Social Studies teacher is so cool. soooo cool. 1/2 the time, that is, the other half he's a regular ex-drill seargant social studies teacher. But, hey, when your teacher locks a student out of the class room, then when she (the student) returns he motions for her (the student) to go to the other door on the opposite side of the classroom, locks that door, and goes to the door she (the student) had tried at the beginning and unlocks it, standing there with it open and motioning to her (the student) to come over there, what was she doing over there on the door no body uses?  You tend to laugh your head off and decide he's not to bad. Eh, it's better than some teachers.

Yes!!! Woo! Oh yaaa, oh yaaa...Of course I didn't influence my answers! *looks guilty* ok, so I've never had an alien boyfriend. Saying that I did a few times on a test isn't really cheating. Let's talk about something else.

Yay, I hooked Mione. *Steeples fingers* eeeexcellent. All is going to plan...And Caitie just saw an episode today. Muahahaha!! I'm Liz (wow, what a coincidence, it's my real name!), Mione's Isabelle, Caitie should be Maria...we need someone I hate to be Tess. Then kill her off. Did I say that out loud?"

ya. Eww. Let's trade...well, sorta. I'd rather not be killed by toast. But that's just my preference. And, I saw that bit about Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp has never been ugly a day in his life. It's physically impossoble. He'd look ummm (I would have said godly, but I have a religion) umm, he'd look positively yummy even in mud. Hey, he'd look BETTER in mud. ok, off that subject..

Oh, ya.

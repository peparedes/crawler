Rat-tailed Jimmy is a second hand hood
He deals out in Hollywood
Got a '65 Chevy, primered flames
Traded for some powdered goods
Jigsaw Jimmy He's runnin' a gang
But I hear he's doin' o.k.
Got a cozy little job, sells the Mexican mob
Packages of candycaine

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel alright
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood

Cops on the corner always ignore
Somebody's getting paid
Jimmy's got it wired, law's for hire
Got it made in the shade
Got a little hideaway, does business all day
But at night he'll always be found
Selling sugar to the sweet
People on the street
Call this Jimmy's town

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel alright
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankenstein I've got one thing you'll understand
He's not what you'd call a glamorous man
Got one thing that's easily understood
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood

He'll tell you he's the king
Of thes barrio streets
Moving up to shangri-la
Came by his wealth as a matter of luck
Says he never broke no law
Two time loser running out of juice
Time to move out quick
Heard a rumour going round
Jimmy's going down
This time it's gonna stick

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel alright
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankenstein

Let him soothe your soul, just take his hand
Some people call him an evil man
Let him introduce himself real good"

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut 
My weakness is that I care too much 
And my scars remind me that the past is real 
I tear my heart open just to feel 

I'm Drunk and I'm feeling down 
And I just wanna be alone 
I'm pissed 'cause you came around 
Why don't you just go home? 
'Cause I channeled all your pain 
And I can't help you fix yourself 
You're making me insane 
All I can say is... 

[Chorus:]
I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut 
And my weakness is that I care too much 
And our scars remind us that the past is real 
I tear my heart open just to feel 

I tried to help you once 
Against my own advice 
I saw you going down 
But you never realized 
That you're drowning in the water 
So I offered you my hand 
Compassion's in my nature 
Tonight is our last stand 

[Chorus]

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down 
And I just wanna be alone 
You shoulda' never come around 
Why don't you just go home? 
'Cause you're drowning in the water 
And I tried to grab your hand 
I left my heart open 
But you didn't understand 
But you didn't understand

Go fix yourself 

I can't help you fix yourself 
But at least I can say I tried 
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life 
I can't help you fix yourself 
But at least I can say I tried 
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life 

[Chorus x2]"

"event","From my friend Mike's xanga (I'm going to be quoting people left and right for a while so bear with me): ""So lately in this little sphere called earth I've been spinning around mindlessly in the universe realizing that the only thing certain in life is death. Does that make life and all its little adventures pointless, hmmm, I'll let you be the judge of that. But I know... I'm not gonna stress about something that isn't guarenteed... tomorrow... I'll live for today."" All that's happened lately, even in merely the last week, it's causing me to wonder ""why"" about everything. Why do I have to act like a self-important attention whore, when all I really want is to understand those I care about? To be able to verbalize how I feel, to give them an honest reasoning for everything that I do, and to give them a chance to do the same... without losing them... 
Why are we, as humans, so dense and shallow and self-involved and fucking egotistical that we can't see ourselves for what we truly are? Ha, ""smartest beings on earth"" my ass. We're just a bunch of hypocrites attempting to make ourselves known by degrading others. 

<center>You are completely oblivious
Just like a newborn child
You don't know why you were born
Or for what purpose you exist
You simply shout to emphasize your life
Your own existance
You are completely oblivious</center>
Your thoughts are <i>move on, get over it, your problems are insignificant to the rest of the world</i>. Unfortunately you know its not that easy. All you can do is try to make things better, and hope it works out. <i>Come what may.</i>"

Supposed to have a test in Davis's class that I never did study for, meaning I have an extra weekend to read up on that ish. Stupid 1920s... we were pissed at the Russians, cars became uber popular, and Coolidge and Harding were ""business"" presidents. What else do I care about??? Tried studying yesterday, and I fell asleep on the couch, so I gave up. 
Spent the rest of the day online talking to a few people, just whoever signed on and could hold their end of a conversation. Learned my ""crush"" sensor is a bit off, but then again, there's reasoning behind that... ANYWAY, yeah, my cell phone! My mom put it next to me yesterday morning while I was sleeping and called it to wake me up. I was dreaming, and I thought it was one of my friend's phones, so I was like, why aren't you picking that up?? Woke up the second time she called, picked up the third, and Monday I want to fill all the slots in my phonebook :-) Called an old friend last night and we talked for a while. Went to sleep late this morning, like after 4, and they still hadn't updated on status of PG schools, so at that point I was just hoping. Going to sign up for driver's ed at sometime this afternoon, I'm biding time until my mom gets back. Hm, well, that's it. 'dios--"

Two I'm not to stressed over, the robot competition is killing me. Our mentor is pissed at our group, and I've given up on asking him for help. Some of my group members don't know one fucking thing about the project and we've been working on it for three months. We should be done by now. Complete, finito, able to work on the final touches, but NOOOO, we've fried the chips. %&$*@$. And one of my parnters, a certain ELF, not the funny type like Will Ferrel, the small bitchy ones, is getting on my last nerve....
But Friday we went on a field trip, and except for the boring lectures, it was a blast. Got to hang out with friends, get free junk, and skip school! Plus I found out that I really really like this guy... goddamnit if it doesn't matter... 
Saturday, my friend stayed the night, we watched a few movies... Sunday night she stayed again, we got our project done, and bugged some people online :P LOL she's cool, crazy and LIVELY too say the least! LOVE YOU CARLY!!! YOU'RE MY DAWG BLUE!!! Monday, visited with an old friend, make a spontaneous decision to jump on the metro, and my blonde self bought a $20 farecard... not the smartest thing I've done. Had fun overall, went first to Pentagon City then Ballston Mall, got in trouble cuz I was an hour late and my mom had to wait the full hour for me at the metro station. Oh well, at least I didn't get into too much trouble. I might get a cell phone cuz she wants to know where I am, especially when I make sudden changes like that. 
Ya know what? Things are good...... *smile*

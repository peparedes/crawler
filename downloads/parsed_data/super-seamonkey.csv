Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

Write for example, 'The night is shattered
and the blue stars shiver in the distance.'

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.

To hear immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to a pasture.

What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is shattered and she is not with me.

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

My sight searches for her as though to go to her.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night whitening the same trees.
We, of that time, are no longer the same.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.
Her voice. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.
Love is short, forgetting is so long.

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that I write for her."

"event","what does a number mean?

hindi to parang philo. hindi ko sasabihin na meron o walng purong konsepto ng ""walo"", at hindi ko sisimulan ang pagbabalik ni heidegger. gusto ko lang malaman kung may ibig sabihin ba talaga ang isang numero, o nagkakaroon lang ng kahulugan ito ayon sa tao.

halimbawa. para kay ilang mga kaibigan ko, mahalaga ang iba't ibang bilang. naiiba lang ito ayon sa pakakahulugan. maaaring dahil sa petsa na naging sila, o dahil sa mga paniniwalang maswete ang numerong ito. maraming maaaring dahilan.

why do we bother giving meaning to a number? will actually have a meaning?

a number seems to have an intrinsic value to it. three will always be three apples, or three bananas. five will always be five people, five cell phones, or five pdas. eight will always mean eight kisses, or eight hours or eight months.

but does the meaning we attatch to something actually mean something?

i think im rambling now. i will stop. 

punyeta. why even bother."

i fell asleep during theo class kanina. the lecture wasn't boring.. pagod lang talaga ako. from everything, i guess. galing pa kasi ako ng bel. tapos dinismiss kami saktong bell. so 10 minutes from bel to seclec3. haay. i hate my sched. at least malapit nang matapos itong sem.

im really looking forward na matapos na tong sem. para isang sem na lang. tapos trabaho na. hmm... that can draw mixed reactions. hehehe. pero.. good luck. kudos to all of us diba?

naiinis talaga ako when people play games sa mga pc dito sa comp lab. ang dami-daming taong naghihintay.. sabay ako nagsusulat lang rin sa blog. hehehe. suffer you bastards.

anyway.

ive run out of things to say. hehehe. well write more meaningful things sa blog next time."

"event","its been around 4 days since huling magusap kami ni tieza nang matino. nakakainis. ayoko na nga lang isipin eh kasi nagagalit lang ako. at ayoko nang magalit. kasi after nun mapapagod lang ako. tapos wala na akong gana to do anything else. and that's bad kasi student ako. hehehe. and everything suffers.

nadidilemma pa ako kung anong gagawin ko later. i have around 3 things to do: go to vany's debut in capitol at around 530, go to patch's birthday party at 8, tapos shindig. where do i go.. wala naman ako transpo.. loser. i wish i had a car already.

"event","its been a while.. pati ba naman blog ko hindi ko naaalagaan.

its been a whirlwind of months. i guess i stopped writing for a while kasi nagkakalabuan kami ni tiez during nung summer, tapos i never mustered enough courage to write about it; partly because ayaw ko malaman ng ibang tao, partly because naiinis lang ako pag iniisip ko. 

but here i am now. alive. 

where to begin... 

acads suck. acads were always the hardest thing to cope with, i guess. i was never so serious about it. i always try to do my best, but somehow always falls short of being what everyone expects me to be. nakakainis na rin siguro minsan. 

im struggling with my orgs kasi feeling ko hindi na ako nakakacontribute nang maayos sa kanila. asla, tugon.. whichever. hindi ko alam kung bakit. nakakawalan na lang ng gana minsan e. 

i want to quit smoking na talaga. for real this time. haaay. heaven help me. hehehe.

ayun. yun na lang mna. hehehehe."

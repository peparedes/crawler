we're after the same rainbow's end.
&nbsp;wherever you're going, i'm going your way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;two drifters off to see the world,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's such a lot of world to see.

""i went in the ocean, i went looking for some love,
all i found is that i found i haven't found enough.""</center>

this is all of me, right here;
and nothing is able to pick it up.

i'm lonesome and all i miss is having someone to curl up with and feel their heart beat,
right next to my own. the silence only broken by the whispering of our fingers.

<b>i am alone, and was never more aware.</b>

good night. <font size=""5"">&hearts;.</font>"

In other news: 
- I joined the Navy as an undergraduate Marine Engineer Officer.  I get pay, uniforms, ID etc next week
- My car got written off in a fire.  The car parked next to it had a Molotov cocktail thrown through the window, so mine copped the resulting heat and flame and stuff
- On Tuesday I managed to lock myself out of my house for 6 hours

Nonetheless, here are my newly discovered fetishes:  biting and South African accents.  And before you call me a freak, consider that at least it's not feet or goats.


I wonder how long I can get away with this before my South African friend from uni starts to wonder why I suddenly start squeaking when he starts to talk :P  No, no, I'm not that bad.  I can keep a straight face when it's necessary... shame I hate poker, I could be awesome."

Stimulus?  For 40 minutes, a tiny little spider lived on my sleeve.  It was a camouflaging spider, for it was kind of translucent when it dropped onto my arm and then became chocolate-ish (the colour of my top, incidentally).

The point is, before I digress further, that for those 40 minutes I felt a sense of responsibility for that tiny life.  I was careful not to brush my arm against a wall or make sudden movements that would knock the spider too was a spider wending my way through the brown fibrous jungle that is the cotton/spandex fabric of my sleeve.

And when I finally decided to let the spider crawl onto a shrub to fend for itself once more, I really did feel a twinge of sadness.  That a friend had moved into and out of my life, all in the space of 40 minutes.  I stood there watching it find its way to a more stable position, and then walked away, head full of thoughts.

So.  Though you may feel invisible or meaningless, believe me when I say that you have and may be continuing to make a difference.  A little spider did."

Zlah, exams make me so damn lazy.  I curled up on my bed with a friend's portable DVD player and watched Revolutions all this evening, despite having two Italian exams tomorrow.  I just find that I need something, anything, to alleviate the boredom... thank the powers that be for the weekend. *sigh*"

"event","List your current six favourite songs, then pick six other people that have to do the same.

H'ok, so, he made this paper boat... (you know the rest)

1. Another One Bites The Dust - Queen:  One of the only songs that would have the power to turn me from a wallfower into a pimping jive machine.  I don't dance, but for this song I will make an exception without fail.

2. Brick - Ben Folds Five:  Just an achingly beautiful piece of music that I wish I could float away on...

3. Amazing - Josh Kelly:  Not something that I would usually go out of my to listen to, but the lyrics (chorus particularly) really draw me in and make me think of ... someone.

4. Kate Kelly - The Whitlams:  Because the Whitlams are awesome, ok?!  Nah, beep-of-silence was listening to this track virtually non-stop some time ago.  It's haunting, menacing and nostalgic all at the same time.  Love it!

5. Salt Sweat Sugar (Bleed American) - Jimmy Eat World:  Thank you uruserce for recently introducing me to the mastery of Jimmy Eat World!  This is one of those upbeat songs that makes me wanna perform some serious air guitar :)

6. Reckless - Australian Crawl:  First heard it on 'The Postcard Bandit' and then when it came on the radio in all it's complete glory, I reckoned it was awesome.


If I had room I would include Glycerine - Bush for it's mellowness, and Thunderstruck - ACDC for being one of my all-time favourites.  There are so many!  I wants them all to be here *cries*

I nominate-
tragic_beauty66
beep_of_silence

"event","Why do I care so much what he does in his spare time, or to relax?  Just because I don't agree with some of the methods... what gives me the right?  Perhaps it's my deeply ingrained sense of protectiveness coming out again.  I know he's more than big enough to look after himself, but the knowledge that he's putting that shite into his body hurts me.  I mean really hurts me, not only emotionally but makes me feel sick to the stomach.  Surely he can respect himself more than this.

Once he would cringe at the thought of telling me that he'd shared one cigarette with a mate at a party, but now it happens every week after work, and not just one.  I know there are a lot more stresses on him now, juggling uni and work, not to mention a neurotic girlfriend, but there's always a better way!  He knows it's bad for him, he knows it upsets me, but it keeps happening.  He says he feels guilty, but I don't want him to feel guilt or to pressure him to change... I just want him to understand.  I hope I can talk to him about it this week a bit without sounding like his mother.  I'm sure it bugs him that I act this way and I wish I could just let it go.

Bec reckons that it affects me so because I unconsciously feed off the negative energy it produces in him, being so close and all.  It makes sense, but even if you put all the hippy stuff aside, sometimes I think I'm being somewhat anally retentive about the whole thing.  I just don't know how to deal with this... and why is it affecting me more than usual now?  All the extra hormones running around my body?  True, they're making me more quick to snap at people and that in itself makes me feel guilty... goddamn it, I just don't know!!

Bugger it, aside from this niggling irritation and hurt, I have great weekends with him and I refuse to let it taint the good times and the good talks.  Love him so damn much. *rueful smile*

"event","Well, this entry is mainly for the benefit of certain persons (i.e. uruserce who has given up on bugging me to update) as opposed to self.  But a little purging of pent-up feelings wouldn't go astray.  Apparently.

Well... I suppose I could start by saying how so few people are worth one's time.  :insert blatant references to today's ""under the tree"" convos here:  Admittedly it does become a little irritating, being referred to as a lesbian by a bunch of ignorant garden tools and all, but when it all comes down to it one can laugh at their stupidity.  It's not as though their opinion matters.  To anyone or anything.  However, there is a difference between hearing oneself ""insulted"" and hearing that others who are completely blameless/innocent/decent people have been slandered.  THEN killing the aforementioned tools seems completely justified.  Hence I can see where you is coming from.

To a control freak, or whatever it is that I'm stereotyped as, having that perfectly formulated life's plan crushed and twisted until it is forlorn and barely recognisable is a painful experience.  Ah well, that's where the whole determination thing comes in.  I don't care what it takes, it will happen.  If only I were a little more patient.  Or better at maths.  If the latter were the case perhaps I wouldn't be in this current situation.  Grrr, argh.

Well, must go and do what boarders and fruity raccoons do best - eat and stress, in that order.  And perhaps watch this strange creature called a 'rock n roll hampster'.  *shrugs*

It just won't work, I can't have my head and heart torn open on an internet site for all to see at their leisure.  Ask me then, why am I even a member of LJ?  Truth be told I have no idea.  (Possibly one of those following the crowd things I always promise myself I won't do and then sometimes make a hypocrite of myself by doing.)  I don't get this, any of it so I don't expect anyone who's reading this too.
Bloody hell, I hate that I can't change the things I so badly want to, or need to change and don't have the power to stop the things that are changing out of my control.  I can usually deal fine with the stuff in my life that is changing but it hurts me so deep when its happening to my friends, the ones that i really care about.  I can see it tearing them apart and I'm powerless to stop it.  I hate that I can't do anything to help even, i say I'm there for them and I mean that with all of my heart but in reality all I can do is stand at the bottom of the rollercoaster waiting for them to come down or start to panic if it looks like they're stuck at the top.  I just get so damn frustrated!!
i need to hit something.  yep, that's it, I need to hit something very hard... only problem is I'm worried that I'll fracture my hand and have to forgo the tournament, I'll never do that, the tournament is one bright spark at the end of the tunnel at the moment.  Everything seems as though it closing in and i'm encased in blackness.  I'm stumbling blind, don't even truly know where I'm going apart from this subconcious drive to survive.  I know where I want to be at the end of these next two years and I'll do whatever I have to make it happen, even if it means going around in confused circles for a while.
I'm gonna go now before I change my mind and delete all this stuff... it seems so pointless anyway, how is any of this going to help."

Some examples of the Demon Form are Seth (Egyptian)<br>and The Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Christian).
The Demon is associated with the concept of<br>destruction, the number 8, and the element of<br>earth.
His sign is the full moon.

As a member of Form 8, you are a very strong willed<br>individual.  You don't let others' opinions<br>sway your own and you're usually not afraid to<br>speak your mind.  However, some may see you as<br>a bit overly passionate but it's just because<br>you never back down from your values.  No<br>matter what, you always do everything with<br>style.  Demons are the best friends to have<br>because they will back you up.

Nice... That's just how I want to be remembered, the one who killed everybody!  Hang on, there's a vicious irony in that, if there's no-one left there'll be no-one to remember it.  Damn.  Well, if I get my act together, I might preserve all my friends to be my minions for a while, that could be amusing.

I just got back from the Yr 11 Boarders Camp at Point Peron.  It was actually pretty mad, not that I was there for the whole thing because I was preoccupied with cricket on Saturday morning (we won so it was all good!), but hey...  Being anti-social and not joining in with the disco because the music is crap and then lying in the middle of a basketball court watching the stars is fun.  Do I have a strange idea of fun?"

"event","W00tness!  I have joined the ranks of the LJ against my previous will.  I thought it was dodge, but I can admit when I'm wrong... could be fun.  I don't know what the hell to write but my brilliant friend lone_one has told me to update (or in my actual case, BEGIN) my new LJ.  I really need an avatar and began to make one several hours ago but then I realise it was too big so I became rather irritated, it was so pretty!  Mmm... Tom Cruise in Top Gun, Holden badge and kanji carving all in one, plus a strange little fruity-raccoony type quote.

Just something to fill in space because I feel like it *so there*:

A REMINDER OF MY LIFE

The bruises on my arms remind me
That I am nothing
No, that I am less than nothing
That I am not worth the clothes on my back

The bruises on my legs and feet remind me
That I am not loved
Never have been, and never will be
That I am lower than the earth that I walk on

The welts on my back remind me
That I am always wrong
And I deserve pain for existing at all
That I am as unwanted as a drowned kitten

The emptiness in my stomach reminds me
That I have no rights
Especially not the right to live
That I am more transparent than the water I drink

The tear-streaks on my face remind me
That I should never speak
Or hear, taste, see touch or breathe
That I am as mindless as the cold cement I sleep on

The scars on my wrists remind me
That I will go to hell
For being too damned to simply die"

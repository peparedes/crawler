I've never been so hurt in to my WHOLE LIFE! i Never thought anyone in their right mind would EVER do that to me- NOT EVEN NATE! Will told me its not true but why should i believe him- why would he admit to beeing with another girl!! I didnt sleep at all last night- i kept picturing me with Will an then i would think of him with Lauren an i would have to tell myself to stop before i cried- i had NIGHTMARES of seeing them together it was HORRIBLE! but i HAVE to accept it an let it go- an promise myself that i'll be happy for him no matter what - as long as he's happy right? 

anyway- i think im going on a date with ADAM tonight! cutest boy evaaa
i dont know if i should do this though-bcuz i dont want to hurt will but at the same time look what he's doing to me! whatever we'll see- Carnival- HERE I COME lol

Ohhh ""NEVER HAVE I EVER"" __ Punched one of my ""SO CALLED FRIENDS"" in the face- BUT I WILL !! What goes aruond... comes around, get ready sweetheart- 

kisses <33"

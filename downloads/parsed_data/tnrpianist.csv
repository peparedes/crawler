"event","Dear All;

I've lied to you as much as I have lied to myself.  I do not live a happy life, which is evident by my actions.  It's not that I have a bad home - far from it.  I make my life aweful by the things I do.

Dear Friends;
I appologize now.  I do not want to take our friendships for granted.  I am selfish.  You mean more to me than you could ever know.  I live a life around you, but for myself.  It shouldn't be that way, tho.  I have taken to many liberties for granted and too many things have been abused.  I am sorry.  

Dear Family;
You are my foundation and I have let the life above crumble.  You are always there and I need you more than ever.  I never make an effort...I have to.  

Dear Musicians;
As much as music is my life, I have to fix that.  I can not only work on music and let everything else turn to shit because of it.  I have to start saying no.  

From October 31st to last night, I had not been drunk.  Last night, I got obliterated with my friends watching.  I don't know why.  I was mad at my mother, and I just wanted it to go away.  Doing close to 15 shots of Vodka doesn't make anything go away.  It makes you black out, which I did.  I don't even remember them leaving or talking to my mother.  WHY?  FUCKING WHY DID I DO THAT?  I embaressed myself infront of the people I care about.  To you I am incredibly sorry.  

I am letting my father take the car for the week, probably over the weekend and til next monday.  I am going to downright STOP Drinking until graduation.  I can't do it anymore.  I always do dumb, DUMB things when I do.  I have to go to school.  I have to get there ontime and be present all day.  I need to graduate.  I want music to be the rest of my life, not beer and cigerettes.  

As far as sex goes...if you've had it with me, great.  I am not a whore, but I can't do it like this anymore.  I want the right person.  Not the person for right-now.  

Before you ask, I am not quitting smoking yet.  

I have made these resolutions.  I will adhere."

Yes, it happened.  December 23rd, 2005.  A grand success and incredibly gay, Chris and I poured our souls into this party.  Everything was planned, even random things.  The gift bags were hott - Pictures of Chris from the Drag Party filled with Hershey Kisses and tied with a blinged out Bow with the back reading, ""Happy Holidays from us to you.  Hope your Holiday Season isn't a drag."" What a knee slapper.  Chris and I had been working on this party that got hastilly cancelled and then put back on in 1 day, from 2 o'clock the day before until 9 that night.  So, Zach, Chris, and myself came home.  Chris slipped and said something - Zach and I got in a fight...but, that's personal.

Ummm - Christmas eve was nice.  I spent most of it at my Dad's depressed.  But I got some sweet gifts.  

Christmas was as good as can be expected after last year.  Thanks for all the sympathy and prayers.  Means a lot.  Got a lot of shit and returned a lot of shit.

Friday night this past week.  Zach and I made up and had a lot put in the open and went on our first date ever.  It cleared up a lot and I am seeing where it goes.  I am not ready for anything and neither is he.  Again, the rest is personal.

I know this wasn't much, but it was something.

I love comments so keep em comin!

3153835603 - I LOVE YOU ALL!!!

"event","I hate having to read my old entries to figure out where I left off...

I swear, I will update this more.

That's a lie...I know it as well as you.

To begin, I have to get something off my chest - go figure.  I AM SCARED AS SHIT ABOUT ALL THIS COLLEGE HOOPLAH!  That's right, hooplah.  I have to finish the EASTMAN application which is abooooouuuuuttttt as long as my life.  I am scared I am not going to get it done.  NAZ is all done.  I just have to mail it.  Talk about coming close to a deadline.  I have like 9 notices from EASTMAN telling me ""Your application is pending finalization.  YOU MUST COMPLETE IT!""  To that I say, Fuck you and wait.  I still have...ummm, 4 days?

I love winter.  It is my favorite season.  I know this is weird, but being at the gas pump at winter smelling the gas makes me crave snowmobiling like a fat kid and cake.  Mmmm - cake.  I also love the sereneness (fuck spelling) of winter.  Everything is so crisp and perfect, even the snowfalling.  No matter the rate, it always looks beautiful.  You ever notice that the air seems cleaner in the winter?  It feels that way.  I don't mind the cold taking my breath away because the air I get back always seems somehow better.  

Musical Auditions are over.  I got Bert...something another.  All I know is I sing some big number called DAMES and marry Kare (rhyme much?) in the role of ANYTIME ANNIE.  Sweet.

I SAW RENT!  I can't lie, this statement just made me remember when Amanda Tennis, Zach, and myself were outside of Oratorio Society and she said ""I saw SAW!"" and then proceeded to half kneel and make a field goal symbol with her arms.  Truly humorous.  Again, fuck spelling.

Anyway, RENT - I have seen it 3 times on stage, and always amazing.  In my top 5 of favorite shows, it had a lot to own up to, and it delivered like Dominoe's.  It was sooooo true to the script.  It just warmed my fat lil heart...lil, ha!
I was a little depressed some people couldn't come, but what are you going to do?  Life's a bitch, prolly the biggest bitch of them all.

I also just saw HARRY POTTER.  Again, amazing.  When did Harry get abs?  Dane and I both noticed...what the hell happened?  I mean come on now...I want abs...and magic.  At least one I can work towards, abs I will never have - get the joke?
...In my internal monologue I just said ""Hoke"", like spainish...no? ok...

My Grandfather did pass away.  I am saddened by this, a great deal.  He was one of those men you were lucky if you knew, and if you didn't you wish you had someone like him in your life.

I keep thinking about the loyal few who check this and the random people who come along once in a while.  I beg of you this time, I love comments - please leave me some.  Everytime you come, just leave one.  They make me feel like I am an aide to your life.  Even if I am not, it is still nice to dream.  Oh life...

Ok - I LOVE YOU ALL!!!
...have you noticed I conclude most entries this way?

Oh Madonna Ciconne, what you do to me.

{end Scene}

So, I have had some interesting weeks since my last update.

The party was overall a success.  Aside from a few sexual issues, it was good.  We had enought kittens for the russian army.  I had a blast and Chris in Drag is my new Christmas card.

Halloween, what did I do - got drunk...go figure.  It was...interesting.  Oh Ingrid, the mistakes you make.
I have to elaborate.  Let's just say Ingrid made out with someone, and Brian (285# Brian) stepped both feet onto Kevin's manhood.  Yes, he did and we watched eating tostitos and drinking milk while we laughed.

Baby Chris just called me a douche - I find that quite amusing.

I FINALLY HAVE ALL MY PIECES LEARNED FOR COLLEGE.  I am waiting on Dr. Allred's letter, Sar's, Mrs. Moore's, Mrs. Brewers, and Mrs. Strong's.  That's it.  Then I just have to audition.

I think I reallllllyyyy want to go to Naz.  I love it there - hardcore homosexual nymph love.

I went to visit Dana this weekend.  It was fun.  Brian is a scary driver, and that is not a lie.  I thought I was going to die in that car.  

I hate my love life.  

We have a concert this Wednesday that I don't want to do.  Plus, we have auditions for the show, then we have Area-All-State.  Right after that I have confrence.  BUSY!

I want you - end scene.

I shall update you!

The world has been good to me.  I am finally done with <u>Silk Stockings</u> and yes, I do miss it.  I had a blast, really.  And for the money I got paid, it was definately worth it.  I also picked up 2 other Jobs from it.  People liked me so much, I am the new Interm organist at First Methodist of Rome and Musical Director in the Spring at Rome CAPITOL theatre.  So, needless to say, I raised my rate - OOPS!

Omitted a section - sorry

Ummm - well, we just had the concert.  I came out of it with my Page turner, Wendizzle, and met my voice teacher.  First thing she says, ""THE ONLY 2 PEOPLE I WAS LOOKING TO SEE SINGING FOR THEIR SECTION, WERE WHERE?  BEHIND THE PIANO!  NOT SINGING!""  To which I responded, ""I am the only accompanist for the entire year, get used to it.""  When she said, ""Oh yea, nice playing - you follow wonderfully!""  C'est la vie!

We are putting together a big party next weekend that is going to kill me.  It is a Drag/Halloween/Birthday party.  It is in the middle of no where and we have to set it up and then I have to leave and come back around 11.  I have to pick people up.

I love my Gwenavear Maloshalavitski - that's my gay-pride mobile!
Good for la buttay!


Ok - Jordan wanted to see if his name would be in here - FUCK YOU, HORDAN!!!

Ok - I love you all!

"event","So, I am sitting here and it wasn't a real good night.

Religion + Money + Issues = Bab Rabbit Feet

Tres not good.

~Anyway, so I just feel...I dunno...like something is wrong.  Like, I wish I knew what it was, but I don't.

My mom and I faught (fuck Spelling) and that is no good.  I just keep thinking, I am doing something wrong in my life.  Why am I working sooooo hard?  I could be a hoodlum out at night, but that's not me.  I am coming to a lot of realizations and it is scaring me.  I have always been told I was mature, but am I?  Or is it that those that surround me that aren't my close friends are immature?  Is age all that is my present judgement?  I feel as though I am a number, a skill, and a fag.  That bothers me.

This whole ""I am discovering who is there for me"" thing is killing me.  I never realized the short term.  I always look to far ahead.  I am now seeing what was infront of me wasn't what I needed.  I feel bad, but I dunno.  This next year is going to be uber tough.  I feel as though after everyone goes, I am left with 4 friends.  I have never thought that in my life.  I know I could give in and just say fuck my morals and my ideals and all that I am trying to figure out, but I feel as though it would hurt me down the line.  

It really is a part of me ending.  It really is and that is hard for me.  Like I can never go back to the amazing year that was 04-05.  I am left with all that was .  I feel like all my life does is rain now.  Like all I have are moments coming back and flooding my thoughts.  I feel as though I really have my life friends.  2 of them.  Maybe three, but we'll see.  I am learning that for every person that I feel I don't care enough about, there is 1 more that cares about me.

I love my mother.

I just feel like I can solve this, but how?  I am going to make people mad this year by declining a lot of invites to perform.  But I don't have time!  

What's good David?

I feel better every time I talk to my 2 closest friends.  They make my life wonderful.  I feel better after stress, if I just let go at night.  I like to sit around and talk, and I am ok with that.  I am finally getting someplace on my piano audition pieces.  I am building confidence with them.  I love Paul.  A lot is good, but the bad is overwhelming.  It really is.

I have to go.  I am getting all EMO!  Eww...

"event","I can not begin to sum up the change in me...

...alas, effort is what makes will.

I feel as though a chapter in my life is closing, and honestly, it was a great ride, but some people grow up and away and other stay still within their enviroment.  Not neccesarily a place, as appropriate as that may be right now, but in past ideals that haven't developed further.  Like change is fear rather than growth.  

A month away was good for me.  I am not going to say I realized who my friends are.  I realized who has truly impacted  my life and that is what matters to me.  Not to say that those who haven't yet or may never are meaningless, for that would be terrible.  Those are the people I have time to grow with.  These are the people I appreciate.  The ones who have grown with me, changed me for the better, and have alloted time to grow with.  

So, now that this chapter of 1 year, 1 full year that has had insane highs and lows throughout is has closed, a brand new one has opened...for me.  I will not waste it.  This is my future.  You want to mess with it, fine, I can't stop you; but, you better have the balls to do it through me.  What's stranger yet is I never lost anything.  You never lose, you always gain.  Ever expierience is an appreciation for what was, could, or should have been there.  That is the growth within.  

I was starting to become depressed and I hated it.  Then I realized, I can take back everything I can control, which is soley myself.  That, I did.  

So I beg of you, all of you, please, be a part of me, or let it go.  This is my ride, my life, and I am NOT getting off.

Speaking of medicine, I am finally getting over this Damn plague - THANK ALLAH!

Friday night, worked with Erika.  That was a chore.  Then I had Vinny's Party.  Now, this was supposed to be sweet and innocent, but it wasn't.  I had ACTs the next morning so I was going to be home by 1:30.  Well, I went there with intention of not drinking...it was his 21st birthday.  That didn't go so well.  I was a little hammered, which is no shock.  Thank Dana for being the responsible person she is and being the DD.  Vinny and I had a talk, amanda and I ballroom danced, Vikky taught me choreography, Dan, Mike, Anthony, and I had a pow-wow.  That takes me to Saturday night.

Saturday night was another event.  Suddenly felt the need to drink again.  So,  I did.  After the worlds worst field days, Dana, Leah, Meg, and myself went to Leahs and swam whilest intoxicating ourelves.  After enumerous dumb actions, lack of cigerettes staying lit, and other such things, we walked home.  Meg was shirtless.  It takes 3 minutes to get to Leahs.  IT TOOK US A HALF HOUR!  Spent the night at danes, it was fun.

Drunken phone calls, less fun.  Sorry everyone.

I am having some emotional disputes within myself and I am sensing them elsewhere.  I don't know what to do about them and I get sick thinking about them, so I burry them.  I just feel like I will never get away from this.

Ok, so I really was going to do some English or US today, but that concept seems to have died.  

I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED.  Sooooo, I have this bad habit of writing songs and then not liking them, writing them down, then throwing them out.  I rarely keep one.  Well, I have been improving this one chord progression since literally the 4th grade and I never could figure out what to do with it.  So I was playing it the other day, venting, then I liked what I was doing with it, then I started humming, which progressed to words and song.  Then I quickly ran to paper, wrote the shit down...FUCKING WHORE, I have a new song - with lyrics.  Not my classical garbage that I always do.  I love it, I really do.  I recorded a rough cut with vocals last night, reaaaaallllly rough.  My voice is dieing right now.  I can't get rid of this cough and I am having terrible Acid reflux.  I really do like it.  Of coarse, after recording it and listening to it in Surround, I realized how crazy classical my voice sounds.  I CAN'T FUCKING SING 'r's wrong!!!  I was soooo mad at some of the things right in my voice.  So, now I am going to go back and insert some changes.  I have to re-do the volume.  OH, I am excited.  I have to get a sound board to...I can borrow one.  

4 days left of classes.  As such entails:
1 theory project - not done, but will be
1 US packet - Down from 6 to 1, so props
1 English Paper - Friday...HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IT IS ABOUT CAUSE SHE TOLD US AND THEN LEFT SCHOOL FOREVER!

I like what leah said when I was getting stressed; ""Don't worry about it.  It will get done because it HAS to get done and eventually it will all be over.""

I just want this year to be over.  I am sure my dedicated fans are sick of that by now.  I have been saying it since, mmmmmm, september maybe?  All I want to do is get my Exams over and my play time in before I have to go to NYSSSA for a month.  

Ok, I really have to go finish getting ready.  So I got a hot hair cut and totally fucked up doing my hair.  It looked great 8 times, but I fucked it up.  Shoot!

"event","I had a very very wonderful weekend. I hang with a great crowd.
Friday, Dana, Dan C., Dan J., Amanda, and Myself went to Domenico's for
a lil bit which was a hoot. There, we invented the word Petty-Tit...Une
Petty-Tit. From there, we left and met Mike, Vikky, and Vinny at
Zebb's. Still Fun. It was a fun night.
<br>
<br>
Saturday...was an event. I had to work, but after is more important. So
at Jade's party, I was having a very good time minding my own business
talking to a few people hangin around, when I realize a friend that
need to remain name-less, but shall be Called Posh Dice, is missing and
no one knows where he is. So, I go to look for him where we last saw
him - the fouton. Now, that boy was a lil dumb that night and neglected
to cut off or to really realize what he was doing. That said, it could
have been a lot worse. So, I find Posh upstairs by le toilet. I bring
him downstairs and lay him down. I come back 15 minutes later to check
on him, just said the beginning of his name to him, and BLAAAAHHHHH!
Threw up all over me. FUCKING FUCK FUCK FUCK. I was so glad I brought
extra clothes and am a bit smarter than said Posh. GRRRR. So, it was
12:30. We kept him up til 3:30 checking on him in 15 minute shifts
talking to him, making him drink water, and making sure he got it out
of his system. But, this is not the worst part of the story. So, after
Posh Dice did this, I said, ""I NEEEEED SALT!"" cause I know salt lifts
stains. So, Nina brings me a salt shaker, ""No Nina, do you have any
industrial size bags?"" Now John in his infinite wisdom said use kitty
liter. So, at the time it sounded like genius. We took BOXES and poored
it all over the stairs, the carpet, the lynolium. It was sad. My
ingenius explaination to Nina was <br>
(Me) - ""Nina, when you piss on the dirt where does it go?"" 
<br>
(Nina) - ""In the Ground""
<br>
(Me) - ""When a cat pee's on litter where does it go?""
<br>
(Nina) - ""In the kitty litter""
<br>
(Me) - ""See, then it must pick up vomit.""
<br>
---I swear, it was genius at the time.  It didn't work.

<br>
<br>
Sunday was fun. Dana and I hung out for a lil bit. Later, Amanda, Mike,
Dan, Vikky, Vinny, Anthony, and Leah all came down to Dana's. It was a
hoot. They later made there way to my house. NOW! I swear to you this.
Never let 3 gay men in a car with directions. Anthony, Vinny, and
Myself GOT LOST IN VERNON!!!!! VERNON!!!!!!!!!!!! Ugh. We passed Dana,
Mike, Leah, Vikky, &amp; Dan in the process of being lost. It was sad.
Oh well.
<br>
<br>
Yesturday was fun.  Hung with Leah.  

<br>
<br>
Tonight I am going to see Anthony at Domenico's.  Call the Cellular or text - 383-5603.  I love you all.<br>

Had quite the weekend.  Friday was a hellish day.  I shadowed Mommy-kins, then went and played for Audgamahaha, leading to me working.  It was no-stop.  At work, I was working alone...oh no wait, I was working with someone else IF THEY WOULD ACTUALLY WORK!!!  I felt like shit and was overwhelmed, but at least I worked.  Hung out with Dana that night.  Saturday I had to play for Audge, same on Sunday, after playing for my churches, and then I had my voice recital.  It was a long day.  LOOOOOONNNNNGGGG weeeeekkkkkkeeeennnnnd.

I heart Rehearsing.

So, I have thouroughly just given up on school.  I swear.  I feel overwhelmed between work, Teaching, Playing, 10 classes, and being ill.  I am sick of it.  3 weeks seems so long for classes.  I just want it all to be over.  Seriously.  WHY DO I HAVE TO STAY IN THIS PLACE WHEN I HAVE ALL OF MY CREDITS AND KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE????  Someone explain to me the use of idle time?  Greatly appreaciate it.  I should have just not taken theory 2 and French and doubled up on English and History and gotten the fuck out of there.  Even if it was to some Music HS in NYC for a year, at least that would be better.  Or finished my senior year at Hamilton, alas no.  I am just bridging.  Which I don't even know if I am doing yet.  I am sick of this.  This is me nervous and pissed at the same time.  I keep bombing tests.  And I am doing work, but there is oodles of it.  And I don't want to hear from a single college bitch that you have more, bc I am doing HS, working, teaching, still taking lessons, and trying to practice.  I know what it feels like to be overwhelmed, oK? OK!  

Fuck, I appologize for that.  

And then there is my love life - I have no clue where that is going.  Ohhhh well.

I am out - 383-5603, I LOVE YOU ALL!

Well, I had NYSSMA last weekend.  It went tres tres tres tres tres...well.  I got in there, and my allergies were like hell that day, and the judge had the window open.  So, he offered me a chance to go get my water bottle which I accepted.  In doing so, I opened the door and in fall an Audra and a Jordan.  Nice Guys, Niiiiiiiice.  Well, then I took my drink, got in my stance, nodded to Mrs. Moore, and I was off - so I thought.  THe piano was a beast.  The first two Chords of the song didn't sound but, I knew the tempo, and MRs. Moore followed wonderfully.  I had a great singing day that day.  At the end, the judge stood and started clapping.  THat was one of the most amazing feelings ever.  THen, he said, ""Rarely do you have a good guy come in here, more rare is a good tenor; the rarest is a True first tenor.  YOU are a true first tenor and more.""  Then he said, ""I really have no negative remarks.  Only one thing, and I want you to know it isn't going to deduct any points from your score.  Don't take a chest breath for any extra air, you don't need it.""  That was it, the rest was all raving.  Then he asked if I was going into Music, and I said for Piano and Voice, hopefully.  Then I did my sight singing and he said my FAVORITE comment ever, ""See you at Confrence!""  FUCKING YESSSSSSS!  Mrs. Moore Called me at 12:30 that night and told me I got a 100.  I can't describe that feeling.  Unless you've had it, it's amazing.  Comprable to getting into NYSSSA or getting Prowda.  

NOW I AM FUCKING SICK!!!  I have a plague.  I swear.  I have to go to voice today and then Docs and then Audges.  Hopefully I can still sing in the recital this sunday, since I am getting judged to sing at Zion by my performance this SUnday.  More good fortune.  FUCK!

Last weekend was a hoot.  Spent the Morning with Dane.  Went to China, gave her a lesson on piano, went to the Mall.  Met with Senior Bianco,...stuff like that.

Ok, I have to go - I love you all! 383-5603"

So, Zach and I broke up.  But it went well.  Really mutual.  I was thinking about it, and now it's done and it feels fine.  It just started to become a really good friendship, which is what we had before.  Sometimes things happen that way.  Oh well.  I have moved on to other things that I am tres exited about, but I also have the attention span of a nat..

Pop-Tarts and 200 calories - each!

So, I am happy now.  It was just getting stressful.  And we still talk and we still hang out, so all is well in the land of David.

NYSSMA tonight - wish me luck.  I hope I get a 100.  Not yesturday, but tuesday, Mrs. Moore said I produced one of the best sounds to ever come out of her studio.  That made me happy.  I feel progress each time I go and that is truly important to me and her, I assume.

Don't we love WICKED?

I felt uber stressenheimend.  That's not a word.  I am trying to memorize a song before 5:30, can't you tell?

So, let me give you the real update.  Lets go the this past weekend.  I worked on Thursday, which was nice.  Then Amanda and I went to see the show Mike, Dan, Anthony, Jen Ru., and Katie were in.  The men played women abstaining from sex to get the women playing men to come back from war.  It was wonderful.  Plus I got to see Jen Rubino in a strap on and a ton of HOTT plot dancing.  IT was wonderful.  I believe I already said that.  Then I went out with the cast afterward, which was a hoot.  The tennis and I got lossed looking for Jen's house, but we made it to Carmella's.  It was still fun.  I think Kevin is hysterical, but Katie is the love of my life with a strap on and we shall get married in a wheel chairs via: Jen Rubino.  OHHHHHHH MY!  I got home late, after completeing our night by getting pulled over for a broken tail light.  Sweeeettt!

Friday I didn't work, but I did teach and NYSSMA stuff, which was nice.  Then I proceeded to go over to Audges and watch the LES MIS movie and improv.  Oh it was a night.  You had to be there.

Saturday, that was ok until late.  I worked forever and spent the whole time cleaning the ice-cream parlor.  I am not even going to tell you what I found in there.  It was gross.  But, none of it near the ice-cream.  That night I had to play some CELTIC EVENING at the Civic center - the boy sucked uber badly.  Then Josh and I went to the Cast party at Mike's house.  It was a hoot and a half.  I had a great time.  I love their dancing.  IT rocks my world.  

Sunday is a fav.  I went to churches in the AM.  Then proceeeded to go to get my tux.  Then I met Zach to see a Bariton from Julliard at Munson-Williams.  He was wonderful.  He sang in German and French and Zach knows German and I know french so it worked well.  It was cute, because then Phill said we were ""perfect for eachother"".  That's an exageration, but still sweet and warming.  Phil was Mr. Paparo's date - jkjkjk.  This is Phil hoying, mind you.  I saw Caryn S. too.  Anyway, I then went for a walk with him forever thru the ghetto.  I was mmmmscruuuured.  Then we sat in a catholic Gazebo.  IT was wonderful.  I had a great time.  It's lame, I know.  

This week I have his show ON thursday or Friday and then THE PROM on Sat...wooot wooot!  

Ok, I really have to go learn this song.  I have to perform it at 5:30.

I love you all - Call me: 383-5603
I didn't quit smoking, PS.  I can't for 2 weeks.  I can't afford to cough up shit right now and ruin my voice before NYSSMA, but the day after, I am done.  WEEEOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"

I had to throw that line in there before I forgot...Yes, still <u>LES MIS</u>.  Sad, I know.

I am home from Texas.  First let me say that it was a much needed vacation.  Truly, I feel relaxed now - or at least til the end of the week.  That said, I AM NEVER TAKING A 12 DAY VACATION AGAIN!  I can't - I can not be out of the swing of things for that long.  1-3 days is wonderful. but 12!?!?!  I didn't know what to do when I wasn't doing something since I had no piano without going out of town to practice at Kathy's friend's.  I got all my homework done the first few days I was there.  I love the book <u>A Brave New World</u>.  Socialism - huh.  Anyway, I am glad I am home.  I missed it here.

I MISSED ZACH AND AMANDA SOOOOOO FRICKEN MUCH!  And I still miss Dana.  I put on a cologne Sunday I haven't used since last summer and all I felt like doing was going to Dana's and sitting on the patio drinking coffee and smoking and then going to rehearsal for Les Mis.  I want Dana home.  Anyway, I got to see Amanda last night, that was nice.  Zach I saw, but couldn't talk to because he had to go to his dress rehearsal for his show somewhere that I am going to see?  I gave Amanda her gift.  I am giving Zach his tonight when we pick him up.  You know, I am so happy with him, it's odd.  We have this insanely weird connection that was truly lacking last time.  It's like we know what eachother is thinking and it's scary when we say stuff at the same time.  But, I really am happy and I trust him, so if I don't see him, I don't worry.  I don't have to and neither does he - but I still miss him.

<font size=""+3""><b>I offically quit smoking today.</b></font>  Yes, I know no one thinks I can do it, but I have to before NYSSSA and now is as good a time as any.

I won Prowda, by the way.  $500, singing and playing at Dollars for Scholars.

But yes, I am trying to quit.  I have to.  I know it.  I wrote the words ""YOUR VOICE"" on my hand to remind me why I am quiting.  Hopefully it will work.

Well, I have to go all.  I LOVE YOU ALL!!!

"event","AM I ON CRACK!?!?!?!  Why, oh WHY am I all of the sudden obsessing over Les Mis.  I think it is my sub-concious going through HPYT withdrawls.  But, it's not like I never see thoses fools.  I dunno.  Maybe it's because I know I am not going to be doing it this summer and fear growing distant.  <<tear>>  But, then I remember what I came out of the show with.  (Before stating this, I must say that DANA ACEE ROCKS MY WORLD!!!)  Anyway, I came out of the show with 3 of the best people I have ever met.  Amanda, Zach, and Anthony...I now need to give you a moment of reflection.

There was one day at rehearsal, toward the very beginning.  The scene was the opening of the second act - the baracade building?  You know, ""Here upon these stones we will build the baracade...""  Latin pamphlets, so fifth...anyway, I was standing at rehearsal in my group of REVOLUTIONARIES with Zach, Mike, Anthony, Jamie, and Mike, and the thought came upon me, ""Wow, I could really see myself hanging out with these guys.""  It's funny when you foreshadow your own life.  I think I grew closest to Anthony the fastest, then Amanda, then Zach.  Zach for different reasons.  But, the relationships between all of us have evolved and changed.  I dunno - maybe I am cheesy.  I just feel like there is a depth to them.  Like they have exhisted for a lot longer than they really have.  All of us have gone through massive changes since we met eachother.  Healthy changes - ones that needed to happen and that makes me happy.  And now I am really happy with the way things are now.  I mean, I am in a great relationship - far better than the first time...and I have wonderful friends surrounding me.  I am happy.

Please let me get Prowda.

I just miss HPYT - I miss the summer nights out.  I miss the aesthetic - the atmosphere - the people - the bitching - the rides with Audge - Jesus in my toast.  Last summer, god...so much happened.  How is this summer going to compete?  I mean, I have NYSSSA, but I know I want to do music - BUT WHAT?  I don't want to teach, but I have to.  I want to spend my whole life performing.  I am not made to stay in one place.  I hate ""small-town"" USA.  Mom says I will hate the city, but I feel like it is a going home for me everytime I go.  Yea, I am sick of tourist-Manhattan, but I would love to live in a non-tourist district.  I want to live on the West Coast.  I want to be in a city for most of my life.  But, I want to call the stage my home.  I wish I could act well. I would love to do musical-theatre, but that would require singing well too.

Why does one person take away all amounts of confidence and conceet I have earned?  Fuck you!

I miss my ring - but I know it is on good hands...
I love you all!  Cell me - 383-5603"

~I truly declare that I had the best MUSICAL time at all-county at this one.  Truly, some of the best music I have sung in a long time.  Far better than Area-All-State.  I hope I make it to conference next year.  Director was really gay and amazing.  I loved him and I wish I had him at VVS.  Amazing!

~Today, 3-22-05:  Well, I went to this Master Class for Voice in Rome and it was amazing.  The soprano studied at Naz, which was a shock; no affense Dane.  She was AMAZING.  Had a few tips for me.  Saw a few friends from Area while I was there.  Mrs. Moore and I rode to her house together.  That was a hoot.  Lets see...OH - I got the Job as the Tenor in next years Sing along Messiah performance at Zion Church.  Directed by the ROB KOLB!  YAYAYAYAYAYAY!  I am the soloist.

~I am torn currently how to do music in college.  I don't know if I should dual major in Vocal Conducting and Piano Performance or do one as a major and the other as a minor.  Piano would be the smarter minor.  I dunno.

~I am happy with my current relationship aspects.  I like where they are and I like where they are going.  This is me smiling!

~Prowda this week.  I am not prepared, but I am to the best of my ability.  Well, I hope I get it.  I fear Bethan, Greg, Willard, and Wendy the most. Oh, I mean that is all the music people doing it - and Jordan.

KARI KARI KARI KARI - Fucked my ears to the point of multiple orgasms last night with her voice.  I was so fucking impressed.  Like, I knew she could sing; obviously, she made it to all eastern.  But still, Her range, ESPECIALLY for a soprano made me melt.  Her stage speaking voice to singing was so contrasting I was astounded.  I am not fond of her teacher, but whatever she is doing with Kari, let her keep doing.  OMG amazing.  Nice job to the whole cast of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN - and nice job to Chris, too...""Set up Scene 7!"" jk

However, there seemed to be another show during the performance....See, apparently I am not alloud to sit close, or hold someones hand in the theatre, or anything with Zach without every person turning to see.  But, we didn't care.  It's not like there was a single thing that wasn't tasteful about it.  I am very happy with the way things are going and veeeerrrryy happy about some other things decided last night.  

Random moments from last night:
Person 1 - ""Place of Residence?""  Zach - ""2000 Saturn L series""
Amanda - ""OMG - NO, this IS the wrong direction!  We have to turn around....""  Enter, snowbank
...and many more..."

Well, I am bored as all sin lately.  Mom is in Tennesse, which I apparently can't spell - along with many other words.  I don't know what to fricken do with myself.  I am sooooo bored.  This is the first time in about 2 years that I have my nights free.  For some unforseen reason, something told me ""Hey, you should NOT do anything for about 3 months this spring - good plan!"" WTF!  Now I have nothing to bitch about :-P ---no, but really, B-O-R-E-D.  

I have decided I am going to go on vacation.  I think I will go to Texas over Spring Break.  Why?  Why, you ask, might I want to do such a thing?  Oh, shall I tell thee.  See, I got to thinking, when was the last time I took a vacation, or even had a time completely away for more than a night to relax.  Now, if we were to count this whole night thing, yes, I went to camp on New Years, but I didn't really relax.  And my trips to NYC are to see shows and look at schools, not vacations.  Not to actually RELAX.  During the summer, last year, mom went camping - I had to work and play some benefit thing AND it was Dana's last few days home.  Then, the year b4 we didn't go anywhere because Joe was going off to college.  Well, this continues back until 7th grade - yes, 4 years.  I haven't been on a vacation of more than a few days since then.  I want to go out of here and I think I will go.  It sounds nice.  I am going to see if I can con some family member into spliting half the ticket cost with me.  

***BOYS***  So, who invented this naive notion that because I am gay and guys are ""all about sex"" that life would be easier?  Cause I want to kill them.  Truly!  Every guy lately seems to have more emotional bagage than a scene from RENT.  AND whhhhhyyyyy is it that as soon as I get re-involved and happy again, apparently that means that all the attractive people have to suddenly persue me?  Do I carry a beacon?  I mean, it's not like I have ever had an awefully hard time (no pun), but it's just odd.  I am happy now - especially since we resolved A LOT of things.  It makes life so much better.

I am thouroughly convinced that no matter how much time you give me to sleep, I will not take advantage of it.  I have to F-ing clue why, but I don't.  I am running on like NO SLEEP right now.  For all you collegete pricks reading this, don't bitch that you got less sleep than me.  I understand.  I am just saying I have the opportunity to get more sleep, but I don't.  Why?  Whyyyyy?  BC THE FRICKEN WEST WING has moved to MIDNIGHT so now I have to stay up later every night to see it on bravo.  It makes me happy.  

Well, I should prolly finish getting ready for the day at some point.  Where is this whole weekend concept and why hasn't it hit me in the face yet?

I LOVE BASSOONS (or htf you spell it)!

Pray for PRAWDA for me!

I love you all - 383-5603"

I am having weird feelings right now.  I want this year to be over.  I want PRAWDA to be over.  I don't want to do it.  I hate competitions.  Pianists don't have competitions.  We don't fight for chairs, we just find out who is better.  

I HAVEN't HEARD FROM NYSSSA!  I want to know now if I got in or not.  I almost don;t want to do it so I can do HPYT, cause I love that.  I just want to go back to HPYT.

Well, I am in a weird place right now.  First off, I am in a good mood, but a weird place.  Does that ever happen to you?  Right - totally forgot that I can hear you answer that question right now...(sarcasm).  Anway, I was uber sick last week.  I the disease of vommit and a wicked bad sinus infection.  I mean, truly, I did NOTHING Friday night except for slept and ate dinner.  I felt likea  whole new level of death.  

POINT A:  I seem to have this weird complex.  Like, an insecurity.  I believe I get it from my mother, but mine developes into paranoia sometimes.  I always feel like people are mad at me.  At the same time, I think I suck at music, when I know I don't.  The truth is, I feed off of people being assertive toward me.  I hate having to call twice or having to justify my playing with myself.  I have this constant debate with myself.  I see myself years ago when I weighed 210 pounds, no joke, had red-hair and glasses and sat on the Sav-On bridge smoking my life away.  That is the way I still see myself in my head.  I feel like that is my image, when I know I weigh so much less and my image has changed and the person has too, but the insecurities haven't.  It's like, I am never good enough, even when I know I am and even if you tell me I am, I work harder and harder and harder til I feel like I get NO WHERE.  IT is starting to really affect me in all the wrong ways.  I am becoming paranoid when I play or sing, worse I am nervous about all of my friendships - I just feel like I am always fucking things up when really things couldn't be better.

I want Dana home NOW - end of story.  

I started lessons with Sar and it was the most amazing expierience of my musical carrier as of late.  I LOVE HIM with all musical passions feasable(fuck spelling).  LOVE HIM!  In one week I Feel everything changing and that is amazing.

It is now 6:30 am...I started writing this last night before Drama.  Then went to drama.  I left in a good mood, now I am no longer in a good mood.  KEN DRAKE CAN FUCK A MONKEY!  A green one with primitive AIDS.  All he did was yell at me for making one mistake when everyone else could make as many as they wanted.  I don't fucking care.  FUck him fuck it all.  Then he had the audacity to say, ""Turn around on that line and look at the girls when you are looking for one.  Stop looking at the Guys David, and look at the girls!""  I COULD HAVE KILLED HIM!  I wish someone would.  Fuck him - whore.

~Got my new sheet music today!  YAY!  It came in that new DHL mail service.  It was kool, and fast.  2 days!  It's Prokofiev Sonata's 1-4.  Why?  Because the book of 1-9 I guess isn't published anymore.  Anyway, I played through Sonata # 2 in d (D minor, thus lower case).  Oh dear jesus.  I thought I was going to cry.  Not only did I connect with it, but I didn't understand it.  It is so random and totally works for me.  It is the HARDEST thing I have played yet and is wonderful.  I love it.  I really like the 3rd sonata too.

~Drama Mama.  Here's where this is going.  NO WHERE!  The show sux.  Not going to lie.  It is terrible, but I dunno.  I get ill thinking about it.  We'll have to wait and see.

~Boy department...had some resolute revolations this week.  Quite a bit more comforted now.  But, I want to see where things go and lets see if we can just take them slowly.  Indeed...

...well, this bug is getting the best of me and I feel I should do some work before I tackle drama tonight.  I love you all!"

"event","Well, after my last entry I have had a lot of time to collect my thoughts.

I realized I had worked soooooooooo hard last year on learning to sight-read AND interpret pieces that now it occurs at the same time.  But, sometimes, some pieces require more and I know that.  Last year, I also spent my life fixing my voice.  Why?  Cause I didn't have one for 26 weeks and I hate my voice.  I worked my ass off from March thru the summer.  I am finally happy with where it is.  I have dynamic control, vabroto speed control, resinance control - I have control.  Why?  Because I had a teacher that worked for me.  For some reason Mrs. Drake worked for me in the beginning and didn't this summer on...so, I was wondering why?  Then I realized. She can't teach outside of a series or without footnotes.  I like Schirmer, Dover, or Urtext publishings.  They give you THE BEST transcriptions without breaking everything down to 3rd grade level - IE: Alfred.  

So, after breaking down to the point where I had the worst week ever.  Worse than anything you can imagine.  I mean, imagine being told ""You are never going to make it..."" at what you want to do.  I met with Sar Strong last night and it felt like my whooooole life had been leading to this point.  It's like, we connected on a level I have never had with anyone.  I mean, little things like relaxed posture, limited 5th finger, independent 4th finger, doing justice to the composer before doing justice to yourself.  I was astounded.  Everything!  I sight-read Chopin and Bach for him last night.  That went fine cause they're the two people I play best.  Then he asked what I was working on and I said I got a nocturne 2 weeks ago and I played that and he seemed very pleases.  So, he is having me order Prokofieff Piano Sonata #2 which is poly-tonal 20th century and amazingly hard. It's about 40 pages long, but I don't have a time limit and that is exciting.  

The other thing is that everyone keeps commenting on my voice lately and I never even noticed it.  See, I am so fucking self-concious when it comes to my voice.  I mean, I hate singing - performance wise.  But, at all county when I came back in to do another quartet for a girl who needed to go the judeges asked me what I wanted to do and...well, it went like this:
Judge - ""What do you want to do when you get older?""
Me - ""Piano Performance""
J - ""Opera?""
Me - ""Piano Performance.""
J - ""Opera!""
Me - ""Piano Performance""
J - ""Do you want to do anything with your voice?""
Me - ""I want to double major, possibly, in vocal conducting, but I don't want to perform.""
J - ""Well, you should.  What schools are you looking at?""
Me - ""Eastman and myself are talking...and Mannes Conservatory.""
Deb Holling - ""Well, they can give you opportunities to sing there.  But, don't give it up""


I don't want to sing.  I hate my voice.  I want to teach voice, maybe.  I would love to conduct, but never perform vocally.  Love to perform piano, though.

Ok, I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!"

"event","I have just come to terms with the fact that I suck - thouroughly at piano.  I spent the last hour balling at my lesson.  I am never going to make it.  NEVER!  I am not going to bitch about Mrs. Drake, I am just going to keep working.  I mean, what's the point in giving up.  I just don't even have any heart left in me.  I wasn't prepared for my FUCKING master class.  I am broken apart.  I want to just cry all day.  It hurt so much to actually have to give up.  HAVE TO GIVE UP.  Yes, I had to...I hate giving up.  But, this is a wake up call.  I realize now how truly arrogant I was becoming and how shitty I really am.  I think this was God telling me that I was full of shit, but without those words.  I needed this, truly.  I was really getting no where fast.  I need to focus on my playing heretofore and not Mrs. Tyler and NYSSMA.  I was wrong to ever think that I was better than anyone, and though I said I didn't, I did.  I knew I did.  I know realize, it's not about whose better, it's about who works the hardest and who it pays off the most for.

See, I got so good last year and so many things happend, and then I spent my summer with all good people that I felt I had to become confident.  I became conceeded.  I became disgusting.  And whose fault is that, MINE!  I needed this.  I have to stop just reading everything and making it sound good.  I have to bridge the gap and become a Student-Musician.  If I hadn't gotten this now, I would have gotten it at college andi t would have been a lot worse.  This whole year has been my fault.  All the music problems.  Voice is the only thing that I keep improving at bc I respect Mrs. Moore and have something I work towards.  Chorus is my fault.  Getting kicked out of the music suite is my fault.  School is my fault.  No wonder I have been feeling emotionally like shit right now.  I am a bitch =  a conceeded ass-hole.  

I have to change this.  I have to fix this.  I need to get up there on the stage and play my lame ""And so it Goes"" without the Fantastic FANTASY FILM NOIR that was going to close the program.  I have to do that.  That will make it real to me.  The fact that I wasn't good enough to do this.  I didn't work hard enough.  I deserve that.  I deserve the emberassment.

"event","It seems like every orginization I join has a list of my imperfections.  Like, the fact my nose could qualify as a sub-continent (hell, a super-continent); or that my ass is big enough to carry drinks to a table when I wait on them; or that I had a tummy that had lost all hope for a 6 pack and went all out in Keg world; but, I am ok with those now and I have lost weight.  What I <b>never</b> thought would be an issue was my sexual orientation!

Yes, as you are well aware, I am a giant fag.  Further and thus, we are supposed to be accepted in the arts.  I have pushed it further to the point where I NEVER hear the word faggot in school.  Especially from kids in my grade.  My goal was to make people comfortable and accepting, not neccesarily understand and support.  I am very proud of my class for that - they can be retarded, but they are very liberal.  There I go, soundin all like Ghandi - watch them follow me to the sea and we'll make salt!  Too much?...ok...moving on - Anyway, Bigitry is not usually encompassed (fuck you leah, I can't spell) within the arts.  I mean please, more than half of Broadway is gay.  That's what theatre is.  More musicians are gay - AND IT'S ACCEPTED.  Why?  Because everyone knows as a performer it does not affect your portrail of a character or performance of a piece.  Kennith did not know this.  ""I am worried your sexual orientation is going to inhibit your portrail of this role...I don't want to see any afeminate hip motions or hand gestures.""  Yes, allow me to stand like there is a cock up my ass!  Thanks Ken, thanks...  PPPPPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!   I was so mortified after that I got in the car and told my mother and she nearly had a shit fit.  She wanted to go right to Mr. Reed, but I said I didn't want that stigma over drama.  So, I never got a chance to talk to Mr. Drake, but my mom did and he appologized to her and soon will to me.  I told Jackie and she said ""That's BULL-SHIT!  I hate your director.  Bigitry is not tolerated in the arts!""  That was comforting.

Well, we have a one-hour delay right now.  I should do some math work soon.  I am indifferent about closing, but Mrs. Tyler is going to be out today.  Which leaves Greg and I in charge of MS Chorus - so he was going to conduct and me play, but Audge offered to come down and help, which is nice.  Then the is 6th period labs which I am going to do with people.  ANd then there is 8th period HS Chorus - weeeoooo - they hate us.  We try, but they hate us.  

Well, I am going to go finish shi-ite up - feel free to call the cellular - 383-5603

Well, I am truly trying to think what has happened this past week.  Well, Monday we started rehearsals - which was pointless.  I mean, they were cast-vocals.  I hate those.  Truly, I do.  And it's not like she actually teaches us anything.  We just keep doing the same things and it doesn't even qualify as repetitious learning.  Well, Tuesday and Wednesday I was home.  Dana and I went to play pool with her brother, Mark.  I ran into ma cousin, Danielle there.  That was nice.  Gosh, what did I do after that.  I dunno - you see, my weeks seem to be blending into themselves right now.  This week I have a feeling is going to be long, though.  

Truth - I didn't see Amanda and Zach enough over break.  Not going to lie; it feels like something is incomplete in my week if I didn't hang out with them.  And it's not like we even do something important.  We do dumb shit - like get lost in random parts of the state we have never been to, maybe see a movie, go to mike's, eat dinner.  It's just fun.  Plus side, I did get to spend a lot of time with Dana.  That's always awesome.  I heart my frau, more than you could ever understand.  

(inner thoughts just occured that I can't write)

OMG OMG OMG OMG!  Amanda and I went to Walmart last night and the weirdest thing happened.  Of coarse, would you expect anything less.  So, we are sitting there admiring the pillows just before the food section, and then out of no where appears this guy.  He was all sorts of scummy looking and had this blue jump-suit thing on.  And he steps right between Amanda and me and shakes my hand.  And he's like ""Hey, I used to go to your school.  I was a senior.  How do you guys like your school?""  I was like, ""It's alright.""  And then without even thinking, I grab amanda and am like, ""Oh my God, Amanda, We have to go!  Mom is making dinner.""  So we turn and say good-bye and ran out of the store without even being able to utter a word to eachother about what just happened.  No-Words.  As soon as we get in the car, we couldn't understand what had just happend.  If it isn't cops pulling us over FOR STANDING INFRONT OF MY OWN HOUSE, it's random people who think they should just talk to us.

If you are unaware, David Wallace, Jr. passed away Christmas morning - and I am not going to go into details.  
I still haven't finished Christmas, but have already done a lot of returns.

I am thouroughly against all illegal, or illegal sale of legal drugs.  This includes pot.  Why help fund people that can destroy families and committ horrible crimes?  I have seen it and it hurts.  You wanna get high?  GET A FUCKING HOBBY and feed off that.  I don't use drugs - I have music, and that is all I need.  There is no need to use them.  Getting drunk once in a while is ok, but don't let it go overboard.  And yes, I smoke - but it's legal, and it isn't destroying my family, but the sideffects might.  

I had fun though, with Dana and Leah and Josh and Amanda and Zach over the break.  It rocked.  GO SEE FINDING NEVERLAND!

"event","So, I have come to the conclusion that gas stations are inevitably the worst place for Dana, Leah, and me...(yes, you use me in that sentence, I promise)
~We arrive at Byrne Dairy on Route 5 before the Citgo to get some gas and windshiel wiper fluid, after not being able to see shit, whilst I get milk.  This proved one of the hardest things I could ever do.  So, Dana and I get out of the car.  I go to clean Dana's windshield while she pumps.  Alas, no gas.  We couldn't figure out why....and dana's face was a pure portrait of pissy anger and pity.  It was great...then we read the big sign that says, ""Please pay after Dark""...so we did.  I bought milk and then we buy a bottle of WindShield Wipper Fluid,  While pumping the gas, leah walks out of the car with another bottle of Windshield wiper fluid.  We are soooo dumb.  After pumping, it took all three of us to open the hood and figure out where to put it.  It was priceless.  I had a great time...

~I am hating this break, thus far - aside from leah and Dana and Chris and Josh and my mom.  My Grandma has me in shambles, but we wont talk about that.  And I am soooo sick of my brother trying to be my father and teach me all of his life lessons.  Frankly, just because he has an apartment and is in college doesn't make him an adult, and further - no one ever stops learning.  No one should make it any harder for me to learn any of lifes wonderful lessons, unless I am the one doing so.  You may call me irogant, ignorant, immature, retarded...I don't care.  Honestly, I have the life lessons I thusfar need, and I got them the hard way...and you learn better that way.  Likewise, my lifes lessons will be the same as well as far different than mosts.  My brother is not a performing Faggot.  He is a commited mechanical enginere.  He wears a condom to not get pregnant.  I wear one to avoid a mess and not to get a VD.  I come home and want to let my guard down, not have to deal with his shit.  I can be myself and not have to put on that god-damn image that I do at work or in school.  I hate getting asked, ""why are you always so happy?""  And I always say, ""I'm not, but I am going to get nowhere telling the world my problems everytime I have one - and no one wants to see that.""  That is what my mother is for...and an LJ.

~I CAN'T STAND THIS ANYMORE!  I really like you, you really like me.  I don't care what one person thinks of you...I care about us.  I love what you want to do, I just wish it didn't affect us.  I hate the way that you have to hide feelings to ""be yourself"".  I want to go back to school and be with you, and keep it quiet again, cause I am happy...but not when I know I am spending New Years alone when I can be with you...even though you have someone you love in all the wrong ways.  I can't stand this.  

~Weirder still...I am not liking being checked out by guys, at all.  It's flattering, but it happens more often than not.  I hate that I have to change my whole image to be noticed, when I still have the same personality.  Fucking...what is the word for image-consumed...SUPERFICIAL bastards.  I don't want to be with you.  Don't you know I go after the guys just coming out or that don't fit the stereotypes or have a life before being a queer?

Let me start with the good.  Tuesday.  I came home and then Amanda and I decided we should do Christmas shopping.  What a feet that was.  We thought we were only there for an hour, then we realized we had been there for over 2.  Oh dear...  Proceeding, I managed to nail down most of my shopping, and buy a pair of hott pants.  Where as Amanda walked away with a lot of Body Spray...for her sister :::cough-cough::: and herself.  ANYWAY, it was a hoot.  I heart my Tennis.  Then Leah came over when we got back.  We decided to watch disc 4 of Queer as Folk, which mind you I have already seen.  But, it is definately worth a second viewing.  Leah gave me my Christmas gift...WHICH I LOVE!  A SIGNED COPY OF RUFAS WAINWRIGHTS NEW CD. WANT TWO!  I love it...ugh - mangasmic.  Well, they left at a little after Midnight, and then I hit the hay.

Wednesday...a day that will live in my mind forever.  It started at a lovely 4:30am, which sucked.  Mom and I were running late, but made it to the bus by 6:40.  Mom and I both tried to sleep on the way down, but that was hopeless.  So we watched the movie on there, which happend to be Jonathon Taylor Thomas's in I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.  Mom cried at the end...it was funny.  So we make it to NYC, and we were both starving.  Of all of the NYC places to eat, we end up at the $6.95 Chinese Buffet.  But, we walked around after and went into a bunch of stores.  And then it came 1:30 - we went to Gershwin theatre.  We walked in the doors, and the ropes hadn't opend yet.  So, when they did, we got our ticket scanned, and then managed to go to the orchestra teer.  We had to wait outside of that, then we were seated.  I COULD HAVE SPIT ON ELPHEBA's FACE!  Our seats were amazing.  I wanted to cry, and I did.  Within the first 30 seconds of the prologue, I was balling.  I couldn't believe I was there.  I can't even describe this show to you.  It is way beyond my favorite show.  I mean, it had humor, love, drama, and a plot with amazing music and dance.  There wasn't a thing to not like.  THE SETS MADE ME CREAM!  Really, I could have.  It was amazing.  AND DEFYING GRAVITY!!!!  OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!  My life was complete after that.  So we left, and I tried to call amanda right then, but didn't get any reception.  We made our way to Rockefeller centre, which was pretty. THen to Macy's where we shopped and ate, and then back on the bus.  It was by far, one of the best days of my life and I will always remember it.  I thanked the piss out of my mom.

"event","Well, I got in at 3am last night after an amazing night.  I had sooo much fun.  I think me 2 favorite things were Dan doing Bab's ""Jingle Bells"" and then Zach falling asleep proceeded by him talking in his sleep ""Bored, Bored, Bored, Bored, Bored, Bored.""  Or something to that regard.  Well, I arived at my door to be greeted by my mother who went to sleep on the couch.  She has never done that to me...so I thought it was no big deal if I was late, cause I never make an effort to be home on time.  Why would I?  I have woken her up before to let her know I was home...sorry, I don't live my life like that.  I work all week for the weekend and I don't like to be hindered in any way.  So she flipped and then grounded me tonight.  Of coarse, I am not one to sit around.  I had a charity event to play for tonight.  And I had to leave at 7.  I just got home.  Mind you, playing an event like this is normally not fun, but I had Audra there - so it was a hoot.  But, I got home and dearest darling mother flipped and said that didn't count as a groundation.  And then she said I will never get scholarships because of what people think of me.  Mind you I am kept at a very high regard in the community and I haven't met a person who genuinley doesn't like me.  So I am not FUCKING worried.  Anyway, we got in a fight but it is over now and I am supposed to be grounded another night, which makes no sense becuase I am home now.  FUCK - I really don't care.  Goodnight and I LOVE YOU ALL!"

Last night Richard decided he would ask my mom if he could date me... While he was DRUNK. lol
Jeeze, Men.
Then I felt bad.. he told her.. ""I don't think she likes me, sometimes she acts like she is cool with me, then other times she just gives me the cold shoulder.""
My mom: ""Oh, she is just like that.""

"event","Well,  I havent updated in a while so... here goes!
The other night we went to this party... which was like an hour away. Chelsea told Ashley and I to go with her cause it would be so much fun and Ashleys birthday was the day before and we never really did anything together. SO! We went.
GUYS are such dickheads. lol
 Okay, so my friend and I are sitting like with our backs to the wall and our feet straight out. Well... about this time Im buzzing... A LOT. Anyways this guy comes and stands over my feet and is like 3 inches from my face. He starts off ""Hi what's your name? Im Bryan."" 
J- Im Juanita and this is Ashley.
B- Wannaanita?
J- uh.. yeah.
B- So where are you guys from?
We tell him...
B- Are you two virgins?
A- No, Im not!
J- That's none of your business, sir!
B- So.. you two like giving head?
WHAT THE HELL? lol

Joel came and rescued us and we went and listened to music in his car. He was so fucking hot!
But... short =/
Anyways... then I met Bill. Bill was tall *.* 6'8! He was cute too and sweet. We played cards for a while and talked... drunk ramblings and such. lol
It was fun!"

"event","Ha, Mayran came back today. Here's a tip guys when you are trying to hit on a girl after not seeing her for 5 months dont say.. ""Damn girl you put on some weight, but it loooooks good!"" ... HE CALLED ME FAT!

I told him he did but he said no he didnt and that the weight Ive put on looks better than before I look more ""mature"" now. ~.~

He also commented that my boobs looked bigger.
And when I was giving him change he was all trying to hold my hand, and turn me around so he could look at my butt. o.o

I offered to slap him ^.^

This guy thinks just because he has money Ill hang all over him like some type of hussy. He works outage as a chemical engineer. He makes like.. 2000 a week + expenses + half his condo get's paid for, I need that job. lol 
He actually offered to take me shopping for anything I want the last time he was here.

He's funny and somewhat cool, but a moron. ~.~"

"event","Last night Chelsea came over around 9ish I think?
I went with her and Charlie..
We drove around and drank for like 3 hours.

We went down to Pilates Crossing and someone was already down there! #.# It was two guys... so we sat there and talk to them for a bit. They graduated the same year as us. They were making fun of our school. THEN they said something about our girls basketball team.. to which I replied ""Oh hell no!"" They just laughed ~.~

Some how we kept ending up in this one town X.X

We were driving around and we saw this guy in his room just reading. His window didnt have curtains or anything. So we stopped outside his window.. turned our lights out and stayed there to see how long until he would see us. We even honked the horn a few times that motherfucker didnt even flinch. alkdjfa We were laughing so hard.. Anyways we left that town and somehow ended back up there... we were taking all backroads....

Well... we went back to see if he was still there... and he was... we turned out our lights and someone was on the porch
and they were like ""OH MY GOD!"" 
Chelsea and I just looked at eachother then we took off. lol

After that we dropped Charlie off and got her into bed. Then we went to some party. Around 2ish I knew I shouldnt drink anymore and they still kept handing them to me. ~.~
So I tried to get Chelsea to take it and I was sitting down. Instead she gives me like the 5th lap dance of the night. When she went to sit on me she spilled my beer all over me. ~.~

Then they wouldnt take me home because they wanted me to stay. -.- So I ate a bunch of goldfish with Audrey and Jolinda while watching some guy look for his shoe. Finally I got home.. got online...made an idiot out of myself then went to bed! lol."

It really pisses me off when people try to take advantage of me just because Im young. Young does not equal stupid.

Some people came in and tried to use these tickets today. Most game rooms give out tickets straight from the machine. However.. since they had not been to our game room before they didnt know ours doesnt.

So, they come in with their tickets trying to use them...

Idiots-""Yeah we want to use our tickets""
Me- ""Uh.. sorry you cant use those here""
Idiots-""Why not? We got these tickets here.""
Me-""Im sorry you must be thinking of another game room, because you did not get those here.""
Idiots-""Yeah we did, we came in January""
Me-""Well, where did you get them?""
Idiots-""From that machine right there."" 
Me-""Really? We just got that machine a few days ago.""
Idiots-""Oh wait.. it was that one over there.""
Me-""Look Im sorry, you didnt get those here. We give out reciepts not tickets.""
Idiots-""That one girl gave us these tickets""
blah blah blah this went on for like 10 minutes
and it wouldnt have been so bad if they were just mistaken and admitted they were wrong. I know they did it on purpose because I have seen them do similar things at other places.
Instead they just kept on and on and were really rude to me... which I dont even know why I care.. but.. I just feel like slapping someone. ~.~"

There were NO gas stations or anything around!@#$@!#$ It was crazy. Wonderful me left my cellphone in my truck, I was in my cousins SUV because I had her kids. Thank GOD ALMIGHTY they had fallen asleep because Lord knows I would have had a nervous breakdown had they been awake.

Okay let's see, babysitting... her kids are really good. I was going to take them to the park for a while BEFORE I GOT LOST. It was so funny, for the life of me I could not find any clean socks of Seth's so I put some of his moms on him. She has a pretty small feet so ... lol

Seth-""These socks are so big! They go up to me knees!""

Oh today was so much fun!!!
First I got up at like 8 but only my little brother would get up with me! My loser sister and cousin slept in! How dare they, deny me when I say 'GET UP IT SNOWED!!!' Losers! 

Anyways!
I got up and my brother and I tried to build a snowman, but alas it was not to be done. Too powdery and wouldnt stick! 
So we came in and warmed up and such. Then I went outside without him, he wanted to watch cartoons. You may ask, ""Why did she go outside with herself?!"" Well the answer my friend is... I MADE AMMUNITION! Yeah, that's right. =D

""Ant come outside I have to show you something!"" *POW POW POW POW POW* XD SUCKER!
He chased me around the house then used my ammo against me, Not cool >.>

Man, this entry is going to be fucking long.

I went over to Ashley and Lizard's house and got Ashley and Jessica. We then went to the park where we were going to roll down this hill!

Being the horrible driver I am.. I parked on the side of the road. HELLO SLIDEVILLE here we come! I started to slide towards this rock wall! My front end of my truck was only about half a foot from it =(. Vincent comes and tries to get me out. Well we succeed in backing up some. THEN DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? My tail end starts to slide! SCARY. But thankfully this pretty cute guy came in his bad ass truck and pulled me out. Then he left.... BUT he came back and started a snowball fight!

We then followed each other around for several hours throwing snowballs at each other. Was a lot of fun. I take back all the mean things I said about him before. XD

Well that eventually got old so we got a bag full of snow and started pelting people that were walking around.
THAT WAS FUN!

When that got old we parked and started throwing snowballs at passing cars.(Only people we knew.) 

D00t, now Im home because I have to work tonight and I need to do some junk, instead Im here... XD lol"

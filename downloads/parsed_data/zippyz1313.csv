ONE more day of work, they are talking about closing down if the strike is still on tomorrow as we are only open half day.
*finger's crossed*   Then I can drive home early. :)

I do have to say this transit strike is doing wonders for my legs. 
Since I have been working such long hours I haven't had a chance to go to the gym,
 but my calves are solid from all the extra walking. 
And I have no problem going to sleep because I'm exhausted by the time I get home.


If I don't have a chance to log on before I take off- Have a safe and wonderful Holiday!
Happy Christmahanakwanzika!!!"

"event","Well, at least today people showed a little more courtesy to others, but not much.
Yesterday was awful, mostly because most of my co-workers couldn't get in, leaving a lot of extra work to do.

The fact that I still have to come in early doesn't help either. The commute isn't bad, even with the 20 minute walk, at this time of day, just a bit cold.

With the office getting quiet, coming in early gives me some free time that I won't get later today.
Hence the early Journal entry.

Irritated at one of the higher-ups. He's had it out for one of my older coworkers for a long time.
Doesn't think he is valuable enough to keep around but he still has several years before he can retire.
He can already collect a full retirement package, but he's just not old enough to retire yet and I am sure he is not looking forward to it either.  Yesterday, this bigwig calls me up to open a secure storage room, which is where both this coworker and myself called out office for several years. Once inside, I suspected he wanted to show what the room was like to a director because of pending construction, but instead he points at my co-worker's desk piled with old documentation, archives and books written by past directors and says:  ""Look at this! Can you believe it? This is where he sits. (Ha ha ha!)I don't know what he's reading, but this is his desk.""
The director made some comment about how great the room was with all the neat equipment and they both left.

What does that have to do with construction??
He had me open a door so he could ridicule my friend and coworker.
I just want to slap him silly, but I'd probably get fired. I told my supervisor I thought that was inappropriate behavior, especially for someone of his standing in the office. Can't do much about it either. 

Arrggghhhh!

On a brighter note, my shopping is mostly done. Some gifts are already in the mail.
Still got some wrapping to do. Only 2.5 workdays to go."

Short weeks coming up, looking forward to traveling home. Got to see the neices and my Pregnant sister.

Received some bad news, my uncle passed away and I just discovered that 
one of my close friends from HS passed away at the begining of the month also.
My uncle I could see, and this guy I knew was goign down a bad path but I never thought he's just . . .
He was the same age, only he was married and had two daughters by different women.
The things you learn about others . . . too late.

On the brighter side, I had some people over on Satrday from a Stargate Group and we watched several hours of SG-1.
It was fun, but a bit teadeous. Should have played a board game or something.
Got Pizza, chips and Soda. 

Sunday, Ed who showed up late to the SG-1 viewing crashed and we went to Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn.
The kids were great.  My pal, Lawrence, gave me some terrific drawings of Submariner (superhero)
 and a quick sketch of Mace Windu. The nurses, doctors and staff were funny.

We missed the bikers this year, maybe next time."

I have too much to do and not enough time to do it in.

As they say . .  Tis the season.  No holiday vacation for me either.
The only other person who knows how to do this stuff is in the Phillipines now.

I wish they would let me train someone else, but we are all too busy.
Ack! Time to go home."

THANK GOD IT's FRIDAY!!!!!
I want to go home and sleep right now, but I keep trudging.
SNOW! Finally, the first real snowfall this year. I saw snow up in Buffalo for turkey Day, but it is not the same.  Nor is it the same as the snow fall I am use to seeing in Mass.

The snow was very nice this morning, I walked through Rockefellar Center and saw the snow on the tree and the angels. Gave me high spirits (pardon the pun) after trying to get to work.

Now, the snow has stopped and the sun is out and it is getting warm.
The snow will melt.

Got tied up at work and lost my train of thought.
Oh well . . ."

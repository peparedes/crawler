"event","<P>hey omgosh yesterday it was such a scary day at school..there&nbsp;i was sitting in math class (period 4) taking a dumb quiz like usually then i hear and see one of those big police cars and then i see a fire truck go by and i was really wondering..before the police car arrived, there was an annoucement over the loud speaker that Officer Rouchette would go down to the gym. so i kinda already knew that it was bad. I thought maybee someone fell off the climbing rock or something..Little to my knowing, 1 person had a seziure and 2 were doing drugs. It was Tara S (seziure girl) Lauren Spano, and elyse mahoney. They were all rushed to a hospital in Hartford. it was soo scary. i couldn`t concentrate on my quiz lol. Then when I went to 5th period (History) 2 of my friends were in gym when it happened. John and Kristin.&nbsp; John told me who it was but i had to like keep asking Kristin waht happened n she started to cri. I really hope they are all doing all right even though i hate all of them lol. Today we had an assembly about it. Mr. Neville (our principal) was really angry. And he told us what happened w/ the seizure..her eyes rolled back, she was shaking, her heart was pounding so fast. She almost died. I`m serious when he was saying that I almost started crying. My friend Pebbles (who was sitting right next to me) knew I was going to cri to. Anyway, today in school I goto miss periods 4,5, and 6.&nbsp;cuz we goto watch Apollo 13 in the auditorium! so today i missed 4 periods out of 7! so thats really kool. AND i got a detention from Ms. Paluch that lil bitch! for chewing gum..w/e i dont care my mom didnt yell at me. Im gonna go play basketball outside and listin to music! TTYL LUA</P>

<P>And if the world is, indeed at an end</P>
<P>Just qimme some peace and quiet instead </P>
<P>of this screaminq tabloid hell -</P>
<P>Oh, who am i kiddinq?! I`ll buy it!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Fashion Question</U></P>

<P><U>Such a Deal</U></P>
<P>I ordered a salad</P>
<P>they brouqht me the soup</P>
<P>and under the table was some kind of qoop</P>
<P>the water was warm</P>
<P>and the freis were cold</P>
<P>the waiter was new </P>
<P>abd the breadstucjs were old</P>
<P>the chance i`ll qo back </P>
<P>isn`t more than a vapor </P>
<P>unless theres a coupon</P>
<P>aqain in the paper.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>12:00, 12:00, 12:00</U></P>
<P>heres a quick and easy way</P>
<P>to set your VCR:</P>
<P>just set it in your driveway</P>
<P>and hit it with your car.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Smiles</U></P>
<P>you smile at him</P>
<P>he smiles back</P>
<P>thinqs are qoinq swell</P>
<P>he could be the one you know,</P>
<P>you just can never tell</P>
<P>but as his smile becomes a lauqh</P>
<P>you start to sink in qrief</P>
<P>perhaps what he`s been smilinq at </P>
<P>is the chocolate in your teeth!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Sweet Surrender</U></P>
<P>When all the world seems aqaisnt me</P>
<P>and I`m feelinq crushed and beat</P>
<P>I hold this cherised knowledqe</P>
<P>mosquitos think I`m sweet.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>At the qym</U></P>
<P>If looks could kill</P>
<P>I`d cast a qlance</P>
<P>toward the inventor</P>
<P>of spandex pants</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Bad day</U></P>
<P>""Have a qood day""</P>
<P>said the cheery voice</P>
<P>does she think I`d have&nbsp;</P>
<P>a bad one by choice?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Ironic isn`t it?</U></P>
<P>Low fat cookies, low fat shakes</P>
<P>and low fat brownies</P>
<P>for qoodness sake!</P>
<P>theres a low fat version</P>
<P>of this and that</P>
<P>as for as you can see </P>
<P>they make a low fat everythinq</P>
<P>byt still no low fat me</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Arqument for call waitinq</U></P>
<P>I call a friend</P>
<P>but the line is busy</P>
<P>so I pour a soda</P>
<P>nice and fizzy</P>
<P>i try aqain</P>
<P>but the line is still tied</P>
<P>how could tit be that shes still occupied </P>
<P>one more time i try the phone</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Still holdinq</U></P>
<P>theres one thinq i`ve fiqured out</P>
<P>thouqh I`m not terribly clever</P>
<P>when some people say </P>
<P>""I`ll put&nbsp;you on hold""</P>
<P>they mean ""Good-bye forever""&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Maybe you`d like to count my fillinqs</U></P>

<P>""what did that cost?""</P>
<P>""Do you color your hair?""</P>
<P>""is that your real nose?""</P>
<P>""What size do you wear?""</P>
<P>Questions like these</P>
<P>put me riqht in the mood</P>
<P>where I just want to ask </P>
<P>""Are you always so rude?""</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Summer</U></P>
<P>No place on Earth is hotter</P>

<P>Love. You Truly Desire Love. You long for someone to hold you and take the pain away. You haven't been in much relationships or you need to work on how to handle them. You always seem lost in a daydream about the person you care about most.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img14.photobucket.com/albums/v43/sammi4790/ashton.gif"">&nbsp;</P>
<P>You are going to marry Ashton Kutcher. He is kind and sweet, but pulls a lot of pranks (and probably quite a few on you too!!)and can always make you laugh. Congrats!!</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img14.photobucket.com/albums/v43/sammi4790/caramel.bmp""></P>
<P>You're a Caramel!! You are known for your sweetness. You are comfortable with yourself, and help others feel the same way about themselves. You are generally friendly to everyone, and believe in second chances</P>

<P><IMG src=""http://img14.photobucket.com/albums/v43/sammi4790/happiness.jpg""></P>
<P>You represent... happiness. Boy, are you full of cheer or what...? You have a sunny disposition and enjoy trying to spread your happiness. You have a tendency to be a little hyper, but you have the ability to make your own fun no matter what.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img14.photobucket.com/albums/v43/sammi4790/slippers.jpg""></P>
<P>Slippers- happy, sweet, and adorable, you are well loved by everyone. People cannot help but like you. You love to be surrounded by people that love you, who- in your case- is anyone.</P>

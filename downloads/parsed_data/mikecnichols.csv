"event","It&#39;s been a long four months here. Lots has happened since the fall. First and foremost, I have gotten two &quot;new&quot; cameras. My father-in-law gave me the rest of his Nikon gear for Christmas. This included the Nikon F3HP body with a bonus waist level viewfinder. A total of 8 new lenses were passed along to me including a 28/f3.5, 35/f2.8, 35/f2.8 (PC-Perspective Control) 50/f1.4, 85/f2, 105/f2.8, 135/f2 (telephoto), &amp; a 200/f4.<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7158/6739154779_7cdc6d9518_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" height=""500"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7158/6739154779_7cdc6d9518.jpg"" style=""border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"" width=""332"" /></a></div><br />With this new equipment, I have started taking my gear to local music shows. I have learned a lot in the past couple of months doing this and am set to shoot a little bigger show down in Asheville, NC at the end of March. Adding this type of photography is something I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time and I am very excited to finally be doing it. It is opening new doors for me in other areas in my life including a newly refreshed creativity.<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7195/6944015581_47eee78d3a_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" height=""332"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7195/6944015581_47eee78d3a.jpg"" style=""border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"" width=""500"" /></a></div><br />The other new camera I got is a Mamiya RB67. This is my first step into medium format photography. So far, I&#39;m still learning the gear and I have gotten frustrated not being able to figure out what &quot;safety mechanism&quot; is causing my shutter release to not work. My second roll of film ended up with only 3 images (out of 10) because I did not understand the basic settings I had the camera on. Fortunately, I am quickly learning and seem to be getting better with my hand metering. I&#39;m sure it will be a while before I am confident and comfortable with it, but already I am seeing how rewarding medium format is!<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7042/6918289645_a724d991fb_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" height=""408"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7042/6918289645_a724d991fb.jpg"" style=""border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"" width=""500"" /></a></div>"

I have taken shots ranging from my children to various nature scenes to the destruction left by an EF3 tornado in Glade Spring. In this time, I&nbsp;also have acquired a &quot;new-to-me&quot; camera, a Minolta X700. 

Since I have so many stock piled, I'm going to share a few every few days for awhile. For now, enjoy the new images.

I&nbsp;am putting together a small portfolio for review so that I may be able to try and sell some photos at a Forest Service visitor center in the area. I am planning on having one display ready (matted, signed, &amp; &quot;sealed&quot;) and several other images for review. I've had some great success and here are my results.

"event","After a little break, I have been working hard in the darkroom this past week. I started last week with processing the last two rolls I've shot, including my first roll of Kodak Ektar 100. I then proceeded to print from each roll. On the Fuji roll, I picked one of the last shots and for the Ektar roll, I&nbsp; chose a shot of Willow. With each shot, I made a first print based off the program made from the <a href=""http://mikecnichols.livejournal.com/72473.html"" target=""_blank""><em>Autumn Rocks</em></a> image. I am still learning about color balancing and keep doing things backwards. Instead of properly adjusting for the slightly yellow tint on the Fuji shot, I ended up with a red tint and then on the Ektar shot, I&nbsp;made it more yellow instead of neutralizing it.

"event","This roll was shot on Kodak Ektar 100. Normally, I am very unimpressed by Kodak color films and stay with Fuji's products. For quite awhile now, I've been itching to try Ektar, as I had read a lot about its fantastic coloring and that it is the finest grain color film. After researching some images shot on Ektar, I bought some. With this first roll, I am well pleased by the results. Even in the harsh sunlight that I&nbsp;shot in for the Hidden Valley shots, I am impressed by what was produced. Since I was testing the film, I also played around a little by shooting some shots of my darkroom and of my Nikon FG surrounded by old canisters of Ektar film (ranging from ISO 25 - ISO 1000).

"event","Since my last night in the darkroom, I&nbsp;made some curtains to block out any remaining light leaking around the plywood window covers I made for the three windows in the basement. I used the denim fabric I&nbsp;was using to cover the doorway inside the closet I was using to load my film for developing. I have since invested in a changing bag. With the curtains made, I have completed my darkroom and can now work down there during daylight hours. 

This evening, I worked on the last print I printed last time. In my last blog entry, I&nbsp;noted that the print was exposed 3 seconds longer than the other prints and that the image came out very &quot;cool.&quot; What I mean by that is that the image has a very noticeable blue tint. My work this evening&nbsp; was to figure out the correct filtration and exposure time to warm up the image. 

The first step was to make a test strip print where I changed filtration settings. To &quot;fix&quot; a blue cast, you first adjust the yellow filtration by decreasing it in varying increments. I&nbsp;originally was going to record the original setting, -5Y, -10Y, -20Y, &amp;&nbsp;-30Y. Since this was the first test strip I have made of this kind, I accidentally made two strips of the original setting. I then recorded -10Y, -20Y, -30Y, &amp;&nbsp;-40Y. My original setting was 69Y. This is was the other settings were &quot;zeroed&quot; from.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5138/5402985149_055e48dd20_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5138/5402985149_055e48dd20.jpg"" target=""_blank"" alt="""" />
&nbsp;</div>I took a break at this point to let the test print dry a little and show its true outcome. You can see the difference in the progression looking from right to left. You can see how the blue cast disappears and a yellow cast appears by the end. In judging from this strip, I went in the middle of -10Y and -20Y and decided to print at -15Y. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5403585104_b4fa2fd6b4_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5403585104_b4fa2fd6b4.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
I&nbsp;went to work again, and quickly turned around a print and began developing it. I got through the stop bath and was beginning to pour the bleach-fix into the drum when I realized I forgot to adjust the filtration to -15Y. I then finished the print and washed and dried the print drum to prepare for one more print. As you can see above, it produced a yellow cast on the print. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5136/5403585256_5ebd899d97_b.jpg""><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5136/5403585256_5ebd899d97.jpg"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</div>
On the , I adjusted the filtration and printed a second print.This time, it came out pretty balanced. I think I&nbsp;will change the filtration to -20Y and will adjust the exposure time from 5 seconds to 3 seconds."

A little nervous, I mixed up the chemistry and then figured my way through the enlarging equipment and made a test strip. Once the exposure process was finished, I guessed my way through putting the exposed paper into the print drum. It took about five minutes to process. I pulled it out of the drum and was immediately disappointed. About half of the image was not developed all the way. Fortunately, I&nbsp;was able to pick an exposure time from this this test print.

With a little more confidence, I went through the cycle again, but with the full exposure of the image.

Excited to print something with more color, I printed a couple more images last night.

Afterward, I grabbed a roll of film I shot last fall and picked an image to print. I used the recommended settings per the color analyzer for this image. Overall, the image came out pretty decent. It is a bit cooler than I would typically want, but it isn't too bad.

When I began my hike, I was worried that the snow might not be deep enough to use snowshoes. Boy, was I worried for nothing. The snow was a steady 2.5-3 feet deep before drifting. Luckily, someone had gone before me and carved out the trail with their snowshoes. This made it easy to follow and made it less likely to fall down. 

Knowing it would be tough, I&nbsp;was not sure how long it would take to get to Whitetop from Elk Garden. The winter air was cool in my lungs while my clothing had me roasting. My hike up lasted almost three hours. This included many many stops for photos, water, &amp; meditation. Exhausted, I&nbsp;kept pushing to keep going till the sun's height was really beginning to decrease rapidly. 

Basically, I made it to the last great view of Mount Rogers before arriving to the road crossing at Whitetop. Though I really wanted to keep going, I knew that I should make sure I had enough time to hike back down. 

At my last stop, I finished the Fuji roll and packed away the FE for the trip. On the way down, I&nbsp;shot through the FG adding to the few images I had already shot through it. By the time I was arriving back into the woods at Elk Garden, the sunset had started. It was that time of day where the sun's angle is just right and makes the mountains glow with fire. As I was descending, Mount Rogers was lit so incredibly with the redness of the sun's rays. 

I knew I would miss the photo opportunity, but once I got down there, I was blessed with more high country winter sunset vistas. In fact, Saturday's sunset just kept amazing me all the way down to Chilhowie. 

Overall, the film isn't the greatest film, but I like the color rendering on several shots of it. For me, it is a nice change from Fuji's colors.&nbsp;I think the film gives a nice vintage feel and a sweet color pallet for the winter sunset shots&nbsp;I took at the end of my hike.

"event","Yesterday, I&nbsp;went snowshoeing on the AT from Elk Garden towards Whitetop. I didn't quite make it to the road crossing (about 2/10s of a mile away), but still had an amazing hike. I brought two cameras each with a different roll of film. The photos in the post come from my Nikon FE on Fuji 200 film. Enjoy!

"event","I recently obtained a film/slide scanner and with it, I finally scanned in all of the black &amp; white rolls I took in 2005 when I&nbsp;truly began this journey as a photographer. Most of the rolls were taken while I was in school at Emory &amp;&nbsp;Henry and were used in my photography class. In that class, I took about 13 rolls but there are only about a dozen images I actually used and even remember printing. 

Because of this, as I was scanning in each roll, I kept looking at &quot;lost images.&quot; I literally was going back through shots I didn't remember even taking. Of course, since I was shooting for class and it was very early in my photography learning, a lot of shots are uninspiring, but a lot of them are. 

This rediscovery of these older images has gotten me inspired to shoot some black &amp; white again. Until then, I am beginning a series to showcase some of my favorites of these black &amp;&nbsp;white shots. 

I hope you can enjoy these as much as I&nbsp;have reminiscing through them.

"event","2010 was full of new and exciting adventures. Some of the main highlights include being published for the first time, going to the NRA&nbsp;conference in Vermont, Autumn backpacking trip through the Mount Rogers high country, the gift of a new to me camera (Nikon FE), &amp; biggest of all, building my darkroom. 

Though I have yet to do any prints at home, I have become accustomed to processing my own film. I have processed all rolls since I started using the Nikon FE. I just received some RA-4 chemicals and soon will receive some RA-4 paper and start experimenting with color printing. 

All in all, I really feel I have grown as a person and a photographer. Though I had previously processed my own black &amp;&nbsp;white film and prints, the research and experience I have had so far has really helped me understand a lot more about the whole art of photography. 

As for now, enjoy the 2010 Photo Recap!

"event","I know October was void of activity after my backpacking trip. Partially, this was due to that I&nbsp;had started this roll right after but I was never ever able to go out and photograph more. We either had other commitments or I was at work. I finally was able to go out and shoot some more autumn images, this time down in my hometown of Lilburn,&nbsp;GA. As I&nbsp;posted a few days ago, I went down to Atlanta to go see the&nbsp;Dave Matthews Band one more time before their year off. Our midwife, Angie, and I arrived at my parents house with a couple of hours to spare. In that time, we took a walk out around the woods I used to explore as a child. What was so great is that the autumn color was pretty much at its peak down there, so I&nbsp;was able to snap away. To finish up the roll, I headed out with Brandy and Willow to Raccoon Branch campground and took a few shots of the autumn hues lighting up the creek. I hope you enjoy these.<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5190159332_c7c8d230c1_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5190159332_c7c8d230c1.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5190155374_caf04ccdc3_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5190155374_caf04ccdc3.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1283/5190159738_89fac64d90_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1283/5190159738_89fac64d90.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1168/5190155462_3fbf773e8f_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1168/5190155462_3fbf773e8f.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1299/5190156690_86ec4d196c_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1299/5190156690_86ec4d196c.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5190157626_0369050e66_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5190157626_0369050e66.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5190157870_6ba46c4b01_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5190157870_6ba46c4b01.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5189556299_8baae012d6_b.jpg""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5189556299_8baae012d6.jpg"" /></a></div><br />You can view the entire roll at the gallery: <a href=""http://mikecnichols.com/gallery/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=14126"" target=""_blank""><em>Fall 2010 #6</em></a>.<br />"

"event","Camping the night in the high country is a unique experience. The elevation combined with the openness due to a lack of trees creates the perfect scenario for high powered winds. During the night, I woke up several times to the howling of the wind. I was in a very thin and lightweight tent, but bundled in my sleeping bag, I&nbsp;was nice and toasty. The wind blew so cold that I slept with my head completely covered to keep my face warm.<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5190149184_32291f93cf_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5190149184_32291f93cf.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />In the morning, I got up early to take some shots of the sunrise. As I was finishing up these shots, a herd of &quot;wild&quot;&nbsp;ponies galloped right in front of me into our camping area all of a sudden. This was quite the spectacle, watching 10-15 ponies running  about 3 feet right in front of you. Honestly, I was bit startled and scared at first because I was walking and there was no prior warning of their coming. As they began to spread around and take in their surroundings, I began to shoot some photographs. Quickly, it became apparent that these ponies were looking for food and didn't care how they got it. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1026/5189551551_d77cd10e4d_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1026/5189551551_d77cd10e4d.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />I am pretty sure that the couple that followed me wherever I was going to were the same ponies I saw at <a href=""http://mikecnichols.livejournal.com/67031.html"" target=""_blank"">the Scales back during the summer on our Huckleberry adventure</a>. The ponies were getting into everything, looking for food. A couple came and licked Brandon's tent as he hid in the tent. I was not sticking around for this, so I packed up as quickly as possible and headed to the Thomas Knob Shelter to make breakfast. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5189550245_9f888d213b_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5189550245_9f888d213b.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />At the shelter, the inhabitants were still there eating their own breakfasts.They welcomed me and we discussed lots of topics, including photography and trail names.

As I started to hike, the cold weather began to produce some sleet showers mixed with a little snow. I felt like I might not go too fast in my hike as there were too many photo opportunities to take advantage of. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1035/5189549283_51fe46038a_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1035/5189549283_51fe46038a.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />I soon passed the spur trail to&nbsp;Mount Rogers and headed into the woods for my descent to Elk Garden Ridge. The four miles to Elk Garden is a diverse hike consisting of high elevation scenery &amp; topography mixing in with the lower elevation forests. There is a nice mix of conifers and deciduous trees as well as several creek or spring crossings. The hike down was pretty much yellow in color due to the autumn hues. Along the way, I was passed by a fellow hiker and crossed paths with several north bounders headed to Mount Rogers. Most interestingly, I crossed paths with a woman jogger and her dog near Deep Gap. It seems impractical to jog in a location as such for the tricky trail.<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5190148558_ae421dfa4e_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5190148558_ae421dfa4e.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />I reached Elk Garden close to noon, which was a little later than I had planned due to the pony incident back at camp. I continued to take advantage of the photo opportunities that were all around me as I continued to the road crossing. Once I crossed the road, I walked up to the trail registry only to find an envelope with my name on it tacked to it. I immediately snatched it and opened it. I exclaimed my jubilation as it was plastic silverware. Brandy had come up earlier in the morning and posted the silverware for me, realizing that I had not packed it in my gear. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5190150400_c1ed21a518_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" alt="""" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5190150400_c1ed21a518.jpg"" /></a></div><br />I continued on into the sugar maple populated forest before me. I hiked another mile or so before I&nbsp;stopped for lunch. In this time, I had met back up with the hiker who passed me earlier on the trail. We hiked together for this time till I stopped for lunch. While cooking my lunch, my fuel ran out and I had to change it out. Surprisingly, my water did not cool down as quickly as I&nbsp;thought that it would. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1032/5189549829_566a7832b7_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1032/5189549829_566a7832b7.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />After lunch, I packed out and continued my way up to Whitetop mountain. This section of trail is one of my favorites as I was surrounded by spruce and fir while saturated with the autumn hues of the sugar maples and other deciduous trees. This was also my only real ascent for the day, so I&nbsp;was sluggish and enjoyed the scenery a bit more. I soon had reached the crest and had my last view of Mount Rogers as I started my hike towards Buzzard Rock. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1037/5190151378_d5052e9aca_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1037/5190151378_d5052e9aca.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />Whitetop is kept open on its southern side which makes for an amazing view of the surrounding ridges and communities below. I soon was to Buzzard Rock where I planned to stop for a Snickers break. I also ran into the hiker I had been passed by all day. Together we enjoyed the beautiful views and pondered the remaining hike down to Lost Mountain as we shielded ourselves from the 30+ mph winds blowing over the rocks. I wouldn't be surprised if those winds were closer to 60 or 70 mph.<br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1005/5189552607_ea928bf176_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1005/5189552607_ea928bf176.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />At this point, I finished the last film roll I carried for the trip and stowed my camera back into my backpack. I brought along my little compact digital camera as well which I had been using all day and would use for the remainder of the hike. Soon we felt the need to hit the trail again and we were on our last 4 miles to Lost Mountain."

"event","The day before my birthday, the Dave Matthews Band announced a 12 show fall tour. Atlanta was one of the lucky cities included in the tour. Since it was just before my birthday, my sister bought me a ticket. Actually, she bought four tickets. At first, I wasn't sure if I would be able to make it for several reasons. I had to make sure I could get the time off first and foremost from work. It also seemed extremely crazy to drive down the day of, spend the night, and drive back the next day alone. It seemed liked a huge waste of gas and I'm not as young as I used to be, that's for sure. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5192105712_2a7d476370.jpg"" alt="""" /></div>
When Brandy and I went to our first midwife appointment just before the tour announcement, our midwife mentioned to me how in the last two years she has become a huge DMB fan. When we went to our next appointment, I mentioned the concert and she expressed interest in going, and so I checked to make sure there was a ticket for her with my sister. 

Usually, my sister and I go to DMB shows alone, but this time we each had another friend. The show was held at Philip's Arena which offered a general admission floor with early entrance for Warehouse ticket holders. This was fabulous for us as we were within the first hundred fans in the door. We secured a spot about 8-10 feet from dead center stage. 
<div>&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diB2aOXYycM"" target=""_blank"">Trombone Shorty Moonwalking</a>
.</div><div class=""ljembed"" style=""text-align: center;""><lj-embed id=""63""/></div>
The show started about 7 when Dave came on stage to introduce the opener, Trombone Shorty &amp; Orleans Ave. The played and enthralling 50 minute set. The music at times was like a mix of Gwar and Brian Setzer Orchestra and the Jackson 5. Overall, I enjoyed their set. The music would not be my first pick for an opener, but I was thoroughly impressed by their talent.
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5190841913_ac92fa166b_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5190841913_ac92fa166b.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
The band took stage about 8:30 and surprised the crowd by opening with Spaceman. For me, I thought that this opener might lead to a more mellow set. Pig was next, which still was in line with this thinking. From Grey Street on, most of the show was a powerhouse of a set. It was full of high energy. After Grey Street, they played Seven. By which time, it was becoming apparent that this set was going to be pretty random. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5191436416_3b2d726c2a_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5191436416_3b2d726c2a.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
One thing to mention, the crowd around us was great. The people in front of us had plastic spoons and would wave them and chant &quot;Spoon&quot; towards Dave. I joined in a time or two. It's funny, but the next night, Dave teased Spoon in the encore. I wonder if our chants had anything to do with that. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">

After Seven, Carter went into a drum solo and led us into Say Goodbye. I absolutely love this song and it is always a treat to watch this. Of more &quot;rare&quot; songs, I have seen it 5 times. This is right up there with as many times I've seen more commonly played tunes such as Two Step and Jimi Thing. Only Ants Marching has more plays. I really feel lucky to have gotten to see this performed frequently. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5190842165_edf9991d44_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5190842165_edf9991d44.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
The run continued with Shake Me Like a Monkey which rocked the house. The combination of Carter and the horns, this song always seems to bring it. To continue the random set, Stay or Leave popped its head out. I saw this back at the beginning of 2009 and was impressed by it then, but this performance blew it out of the water. Carter is a beast on this song. He has thrown so much new stuff into and really brings out the song. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5190842267_f537bd1bce_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5190842267_f537bd1bce.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
Next, they went into Rhyme &amp;&nbsp;Reason. Tim was phenomenal on this. I could never get tired of this song. The riff and melody are interesting enough, but Dave's lyrics are so thought provoking. The continued by playing another Big Whiskey tune, Funny the Way It Is. Though a single, this song is one of their best. I think what I like about it is that it is honest and seems to be from the heart of DMB. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5190842463_6ec00aae56_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5190842463_6ec00aae56.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
Always a crowd-pleaser, Everyday was performed complete with the crowd singing &quot;Honey Honey, come and dance with me.&quot; The show took a seemingly mellow turn as Dave started playing the new song, Black Jack. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5190843185_7ba399b9d7_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5190843185_7ba399b9d7.jpg"" alt="""" /></a>

After that intense performance, Dave brought out Trombone Shorty for What Would You Say?. This song again is a treat to get. Trombone's solo was physically exhausting and perfect for the tune. Now, the band played a few songs typically known for being closers. The jumped in with Pantala Naga Pampa &raquo; Rapunzel. Next, I saw the baritone guitar come on stage and once again i was stumped as to what was going on. The band started jamming a little and soon a jazzy intro was in full swing. Dave even sang a couple lines before fading into the normal Hallelujahs of What You Are. This song again, brought the house down. The power of the music and lyrics is great. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5191438316_c314822b2a_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5191438316_c314822b2a.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
As I had a few times throughout the show, I started chanting Christmas Song before the next tune. This time was different as I was looking directly at Dave and he was looking at me. He then came to the mic and said a kid name Willie asked him to play the next tune. The band then started into Tim Bomb. Though mellow at the start, the end is high impact and in your face. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVoNCHGsArM"" target=""_blank"">Christmas Song</a>
&nbsp;</div><div class=""ljembed"" style=""text-align: center;""><lj-embed id=""64""/></div>

Right afterward, Dave began playing Christmas Song. I found out after the show that they added Christmas Song and I'm pretty certain I was the reason it got played. This was one of the biggest highlights of the night. The mellowness continued with You and Me. Oddly, the band finished the set up with Jimi Thing. Every time&nbsp; I see Jimi Thing, it is always played&nbsp; differently.This performance was not any different and closed on Buffalo Springfield's &quot;For What It's Worth&quot; as the ending outro. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5186376106_95cae39555_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5186376106_95cae39555_z.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div>
When Dave got back on stage after the encore break, he began to speak about the coming song. He said, &quot;20 years ago, I would have said that the writer of this tune is one of my heroes, but now he is a great friend.&quot; He went on to say about the song is a good goodbye tune and that he likes to play it for Roi. Dave on his acoustic went into playing The Needle and the Damage Done by Neil Young. This was an absolute treat to see. The song is a classic and Dave can pull it off perfectly. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">

After Dave was finished, the guitar tech brought up the 12 string and we knew what was coming next! As the band got settled back in their spots, the stage lit up bright and red as they broke into The Last Stop. 12 minutes of sheer intensity to close out the show. The crowd was on fire including myself. This was an excellent end to another great concert with Dave Matthews Band."

"event","One year ago, we were on our way back from Sudan. We were probably over some portion of the Atlantic Ocean either sleeping or reflecting on the mission we had only begun. 

I left you all at our last night in&nbsp;Sudan back in March. The next morning started early for me as I went out again to catch the sunrise. We soon were packed and loading into the vehicles to go to the airport in Yei. Once we were there, we slowly all said our goodbyes to all of our companions in Sudan. What I remember, it was very hard for me to board that plane. I felt like I would never share time with these people again. I hope this to not be true, but will always look upon our time together in a good light. On the plane back to Entebbe, I wrote down my final thoughts from the trip. I soon enjoyed watching the landscape below.

In Entebbe, we enjoyed a little bit of downtime and slowly eased ourselves back to the Western world. We met with the Bishop of the&nbsp;East Africa Conference shortly before we were to depart to the airport. He and David ended up seeing us off at the airport, as we made our way back to our Western worldly lives. 

Looking back is always dangerous. Time can romanticize experiences and other aspects of a trip of this nature. One thing I am truly thankful for is that the truth of the situations between all parties were not glossed over and our mission leaders were honest from the start. It would have been hard to find out a lot of the information that we knew and learned while on the trip after the fact. In all honesty, I think it would have marred the trip's mission for me, but instead, the honesty strengthened the purpose even more to me.&nbsp; 

In the last year in Sudan, free elections were held for the first time  in 24 years. Though controversy surrounded them the whole time, we can  see progression politically.&nbsp; 

As quickly as the trip came upon us, the trip ended. We soon began our lives again. Hopefully, we began them with a wiser sense of priorities, more worldly conscious view, and humbled hearts. Though we all catch ourselves caught up in our own lives from time to time, I think we can all agree that we can use our experiences to be better informed and make clearer choices for ourselves and the world."

The wind blew continuously all night, sometimes so hard it would shake the entire tent. Though I stayed warm, the sound of the wind kept me from sleeping too long and soon it was morning. Luckily, I got out of my tent in time for one of the most majestic sunrises I have <em>ever</em> witnessed in my life. <br /><br />To view the entire album these images are from, you can view them at <a href=""http://mikecnichols.com/gallery/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=13820"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Fall 2010 #4</em></strong></a><em>.</em>"

As I&nbsp;mentioned in my last post, there were artifacts left on the film, but I&nbsp;kind of expected that. I believe that adding a water bath before and after fix, most of this will be avoided.

Ralph gave me a birthday present during the time which caught me off guard. As I said, with my focus on a darkroom, I have had little thought to other aspects of photography. Ralph presented me with a Nikon FE complete with an MD-12 motor and SB-10 flash. As with the FG I've used the past 5 years, the FE&nbsp;was apart of his own arsenal that he has handed over to me. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/4984866531_44dbdbe7c6_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/4984866531_44dbdbe7c6.jpg"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />Excited as I should be, I&nbsp;read the manual and started playing with the features yesterday. Today, I put my first roll of film in it. I put in one of my &quot;test&quot;&nbsp;rolls I'm using for my first C-41 developing. My first shots were of our burgers and fries at the Dip Dog tonight. I&nbsp;also shot some images of the Dip Dog sign with a beautiful blue sky with sunset colored little line clouds accenting in the background. As you know, I do not normally photograph such things, I'm excited to play around as I learn this camera and its features. A few of the highlight features I'm ecstatic about are shutter speeds up to 8 seconds without open shutter, f-stop display in the view finder, and the multiple exposure lever. The latter, I am going to try out on this first roll. What this lever does is allow to set the camera for another shot without advancing the film which allows you to make multiple exposure shots. I've always wanted to mess with this art, but with my previous cameras, it meant guesswork for winding the film back a frame.&nbsp;"

"event","Recently, we went up to Elk Garden for a little hike and to get away. The weather was pretty clear and sunny everywhere until we got up to Elk Garden. We seemed to ascend into the clouds as we peaked at the top of the mountain. Walking around the summit and then climbing the summit made for some interesting scenery. We watched Mount Rogers become encumbered by fog and then we watched the beautiful summer sunset through the fog. At one point, the way the sun appeared through the fog, Brandy understandably mistook it for the moon. A few days later, we explored the Big Bend near Big Walker Mountain after a picnic. While exploring, we found natural inspirations as well as the ruins of the heyday of the area. Enjoy the photos.

"event","It's been a little while since I&nbsp;posted about the darkroom project. Most of the past month, I have been reading John Hedgecoe's Darkroom Techniques. I&nbsp;mainly picked the book up to remind myself of the proper steps for Black &amp;&nbsp;White processing and printing, but in reading, it seems pretty easy to process color film. Best part about most of it is that I can wait on &quot;permanent&quot; ventilation as the only time I need darkness for roll processing is the initial film loading. I will instead use a floor fan directing the air outside. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4925328704_ffcbb406b1.jpg"" alt="""" /></div><br />Therefore, I&nbsp;have started moving towards setting the darkroom up as is. I have been reading the book thoroughly from cover to cover and reading more detailed/opinionated topics online. Last week I&nbsp;got the enlarger up and running. The past two days, I have cleaning up the basement and today I organized my darkroom supplies. While doing this, I sized up what gear I have and what possible gear I need. For now I&nbsp;have all that I&nbsp;need for 35mm and 120mm. I&nbsp;even I&nbsp;have a jig for 35mm slides for the enlarger. It is homemade and it might be wise to invest in a new one down the road. I bought a new developing tank and now  I am only one step away to start developing color film, obtaining the chemicals. In the next couple of weeks, I'll be giving it a go and testing my first couple of rolls! <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4925329130_e2cf3c7aa5.jpg"" alt="""" /></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br />As I get roll processing up and running, I&nbsp;will continue to get ready for processing prints. Color prints are a bit more difficult, and so I want to continue reading and prepare before I start that venture. During the preparation time, I will figure out the permanent ventilation issue and then make the basement be able to be completely dark, in order to print prints.</div><br />"

"event","Thursday, we headed down to Boone to get away and have some fun. Halfway down there, we came upon an overturned gravel truck. Though there was room to get around, the officials would not let anyone pass around, and so we took a detour. It normally takes 1.5 hours to get to Boone, but this time it took close to 3 hours. During that time, fate seemed to say we should go home, but we persevered. After doing the downtown usuals, we took a drive onto the Blue Ridge Parkway. Almost immediately, a storm broke loose on us. It was a severe thunder storm with torrential rain that we braved to go into the Moses Cone Manor to escape for a little bit. Once it died down just a little, we got back in the car and soon the storm let up for a little while. In that time, Willow fell asleep and we stopped at scenic overlook. Here, we took turns going across the Parkway to take some photos. I tell you, it was a nice treat on the Parkway after the storm leaving foggy mountains and beautiful scenery. 

Sunday, we headed up to the Scales for our yearly blueberry picking trip. We arrived a little before dinner and set up camp and relaxed. We always seem to run into someone that Brandy knows and this time was no different. We enjoyed a little company and then ate supper. After supper, we decided to pick for a short while. All around us were wild ponies and it seemed they were following us for awhile. I snapped a couple photos while carrying Willow on my back. This would be the theme as I&nbsp;ascended up the trail towards the top of Pine Mountain. Up there, I took a couple photos of the sunset looking back towards Wilburn Ridge and Mount Rogers. 

This morning, I&nbsp;climbed up the mountain again to get a few morning shots of the beautiful high country before breakfast. after breakfast, we once again picked coming out with a gallon of blueberries and a pint of blackberries. We're discussing about going back or going to Elk Garden to pick more blackberries. Of course, I took a few shots of the blueberries themselves including of a cluster with a clear reflection of the ridge they were facing. After eating some lunch, we packed up and headed back down the mountain. At the bottom, we stopped so that I could finish the roll taking shots of some Yellow Fringed Orchids.

I even climbed up the main falls to view some of the upper falls. I didn't have enough time to climb all the way up to the first set, so I settled trying to capture the main falls in new ways. I then brought out my camera in Georgia for a couple images of Amicalola Falls. I&nbsp;was tripod-less and so I had to make do with my surroundings. Next, we traveled to Buzzard Rock on Whitetop and the weather made for some neat photographic moments. Lastly, I finished this roll on a hike where we found an abandoned turtle shell.

"event","I have been wanting to get organized and actually set up a darkroom for sometime now. My initial hindrance<a href=""http://www.linkmuseum.org/"" target=""_blank""><img hspace=""10"" border=""3"" align=""right"" vspace=""10"" alt=""&quot;Maud&quot; by O. &lt;br /&gt;Winston Link"" src=""http://www.rlrouse.com/pic-of-the-day/maud.jpg"" /></a> was the fear of my gas furnace and photo chemicals. I have dreamed about building an out building, though I knew that would be YEARS away. Then last week, my sister was visiting and we all went to the O. Winston Link Museum in Roanoke. For those who don't know who he is, Link is famous for his images of the last days of the N&amp;W line of steam engines. The images he shot were regional, but a majority of them come from the Mount Rogers area, including his most famous image entitled &quot;Maud.&quot;&nbsp; As you can see, the image portrays a horse bowing in front of Green Cove station with the Virginia Creeper approaching. Now-a-days, this old railway is now a Rails to Trails trail for bikers. <br /><br />Anyway, this trip to the museum not only showed is images, but told about his life and his love for the steam engine. He loved them so much he also made motion pictures and audio recordings of the N&amp;W. The most fascinating part of the exhibit for me was the replication of his studio darkroom complete with all of his tools and chemicals. This inspired me to really start pursuing the completion of a darkroom for myself. <br /><br />I went online and did some research about the danger of having photo chemicals near a pilot light and came to find out that it is not at all dangerous. The most &quot;dangerous&quot; aspect of the process is photo paper, in terms of flammability. One site went so far to say that film and photo developing is about as dangerous as using a library card, and then conjectured that using a library card was probably more dangerous. <br /><br />All in all, I&nbsp;was excited and over the next few days, I thought about how to complete my darkroom. I did more research online about darkroom setups and thought about where I could place a counter space downstairs and then it hit me. A couple of years ago, I helped do some demo work with a friend on a lady's kitchen and came away with a 55&quot; wide piece of laminate counter top. Over the weekend, I wrote down some plans to build a base for the counter top and today I began to build it. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br />&nbsp;<img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4750874016_703b38639e.jpg"" alt="""" /></div><br />My whole plan is to have a drying shelf below the counter top. Other than this added detail, the plans for the base are very simple and should be complete within a few days. Today, I completed the top frame (minus the middle support). I plan to cut and attach the legs next."

"event","One of my hats is that I am President of the <a href=""http://www.friendsofmountrogers.org"" target=""_blank"">Friends of Mount Rogers</a>. At last month's business meeting, the Forest Service shared to us about a conference being hosted by the <a href=""http://www.moosalamoo.org"" target=""_blank"">Moosalamoo Association</a> in Vermont. This conference/retreat was designed to be an ideas generating event by having both Forest Service and their &quot;Friends&quot; partner representation. It was decided that this was a really good opportunity for the group and so I&nbsp;was asked to go. Luckily, everything fell into place and I was able to represent the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area. At last minute, the Forest Service person going had to cancel and so I&nbsp;solely represented our area. In all honestly, it was a little less pressure off me and I felt more comfortable communicating our relationship with the Forest Service. 

The conference started June 2nd and ended June 5th. Author Bill McKibbon was our Wednesday night speaker. He mainly spoke about environment awareness as well as some key features of Vermont. Before his talk, I&nbsp;was lucky to sit with him at dinner and engage in conversation. I have always been wanting to read some of his books, but I&nbsp;came away that night determined to read <em>Wondering Home</em> and <em>Eaarth</em>. 

Most of the programs were lead by the different areas represented. I&nbsp;even ended up leading a discussion on funding issues with a Moosalamoo board member. All during the talks/discussions, I would get idea brainstorms and would jot my thoughts down on my notepad. I am coming away from this conference with a clear vision for the future of the Friends of Mount Rogers and our evolving relationship with the Forest Service here.

Apart from the business, we went on fields trips around the Moosalamoo area. These included a couple of 7am hikes and driving tours in the mid-afternoon. During these outings, I&nbsp;was able to take some photographs. I found that the forest there was very similar to our own here, though there was a lack of rhododendron and mountain laurel. They also have a couple of different tree species not found here, like the balsam fir. 

Enjoy the photos.

"event","As I mentioned before, our Parkway trip spilled over to a second roll. Also on this roll, we enjoyed a labor intensive hike on the Unaka Nature Trail at Comers Rock. The trail had not been tended by anyone since last year, which meant there was a lot of downed limbs and trees along the trail from the harsh winter we had. Though a workout, we found time to reflect in the nature and saw some unusual sitings, at least for us. I ended this roll up on top of Nebo Mountain. It seems that this area has become a new favorite spot to shoot photos. This time, the Mountain Laurel were in bloom and we explored the area more by climbing to the top of the knob. Enjoy these spring shots!

"event","This roll has shots from Laurel Bed Lake taken a few days after the first Spring roll was shot. I concentrated on a couple of shots I was not completely satisfied with from the first roll. I also took some shots of the high elevation lake. After these shots, skip forward to last week's trip to the Blue Ridge Parkway and that leaves us at Mabry Mill and Rocky Knob. Enjoy.

"event","Last Thursday, we embarked on our first &quot;real&quot;&nbsp;vacation in three years. We traveled up to the Blue Ridge Parkway and rented a cabin near Rocky Knob &amp;&nbsp;Mabry Mill. The cabin and its grounds were absolutely lovely, and we are already planning on a fall trip up there. We concluded that the Parkway is best from this area southward, as it is less &quot;commercialized.&quot; What I mean by this is that you don't see houses or high-end cabin communities or tacky shops that cater to the visitor looking for some souvenir of their visit to &quot;redneck hillbilly country.&quot; When you travel south from Rocky Knob, you start the climb into the higher elevations of North Carolina. <br /><br />Once we got home, we continued to vacation it up. We went for a hike on the Unaka Nature Trail near Comers Rock. It was a bit of a challenge with a lot of downed limbs and small trees from the hard winter. We managed to survive and when we got home, we ended the vacation with a campfire. Here we enjoyed roasted marshmallows and fueling the fire with limbs from our old Christmas trees. <br /><br /><div class=""ljembed"" style=""text-align: center;""><lj-embed id=""53""/></div><br />As Brandy put Willow to bed, I found solace in the flickering embers of the coals, resembling the stars in the sky. <br /><br /><div class=""ljembed"" style=""text-align: center;""><lj-embed id=""54""/></div><br />Once my photos are developed, I will share the captured memories of our spring vacation.<br />"

"event","This Spring, I've enjoyed being outdoors more than most Springs. This winter was just a very harsh winter. The snow made for an amazingly rare opportunity for me to capture some great photographic moments, but wore heavy on all of us here by lasting so long. We have tried to hit the trails (Hungry Mother Lake Trail &amp;&nbsp;AT) as much as possible this past month as it has been unseasonably warm. <br /><br />Working with the <a href=""http://www.friendsofmountrogers.org"" target=""_blank"">Friends of Mount Rogers</a>, I also took an opportunity to take some shots of Green&nbsp;Cove Station on the Creeper Trail when we brought up supplies to get ready for opening weekend on the trail. <br /><br />Brandy, Willow, &amp;&nbsp;I went up to Laurel Bed Lake this past Thursday to catch some Spring action. We were blown away by the amazing beauty that awaited us. The side of the mountain was literally covered with blooming trilliums and other wild flowers. An especially rare flower, the Blue-Eyed Mary, is quite prevalent there.&nbsp; It only grows in three counties in Virginia. All in all, we had a joyous day in the vernal beauty that blessed us. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><strong>Green Cove Station</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4548527341_1c5c09c763_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4548527341_1c5c09c763.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4548527421_ce9cfd3e32_b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""3"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4548527421_ce9cfd3e32.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><strong>View from Pugh Mtn.

It has been the 4th of July for over 24 hours, and the sound of fireworks outside my bedroom window is not pleasing me.

I have forgotten the concepts of privacy and personal space. Flat expanse makes me nervous.

Here is the subject:

<img src=""http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421478213/1.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" /> 

Kendall, we missed you.

I am now the owner of a wonderful Underwood vintage typewriter:

 <img src=""http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421478213/0.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" /> 


Driving towards my sister's dance recital in Dayton, we stumbled upon a wonderfully large thrift store.  I made my mom drive me back to it after the recital too see if I could find the typewriter that I have been searching for for a month now, and after minor communication problems with the store owners who didn't speak English well (for a moment I wondered if they couldn't understand me because I was dressed in Indian clothing, which had somehow affected my speech?), a very kind old man assisted me to my treasure.  
After almost half an hour of conversation with this man, who just kept on asking me questions about myself, I managed to escape before he asked for my name and address and phone number (I think I have a phobia of old men due to previous bad experiences).

The dance recital was really good, my sister dances really well, but I feel so strange and intimidated amidst large groups of Indian people: lipsticked high heeled girls with their long nails and shiny hair gossiping chatting smiling to friends on cell phones, old men (shudder) with their coconut oiled hair shining in circles on top of their heads, obnoxious leather cell phone holders attached to their straight legged Levis or on-sale trousers, their wives dolled up in diamonds, gold, gold, pearls, gold, more gold, 23 karat gold, comparing SAT socres colleges med schools Indian bazaars Bollywood films jewelry stores. My parents are not this, but they live with this, they enjoy this, they socialize with this. I wonder if these people cry, I wonder if they remember thin beggars' knuckles as vividly as I do, I wonder if they use it only as an excuse to make their children finish the food on their plates, I wonder what they think about when sitting before elaborately dressed statues of gods and goddesses in temples, I wonder why I can't believe in a blue god that played the flute and ate churned butter from clay pots..

And my parents wonder why I would rather sit at home alone than go to social functions with them.

Indian clothes smell of mothballs and suitcases and grandparents. The smell is comforting, I just want to sit here and remember everything before it changes.

I would like to go on a long train ride in either European or Indian countryside and drink tea on little fold-out tables right now.

My Yogi Tea teabag reads: ""Truth is everlasting."""

I have lost track now of how many fridays i have spent asleep in bed, open book lying next to me, as the phone rang and my mother told my friends that yes, I was asleep, on a friday evening.

Tonight I slept from 5 - 10pm. And it was stupendous.

It's always asked, ""what did you do tonight?"" as if it is some sort of expectation that because it is friday, yes, day FIVE of the week, festivities MUST be in line.

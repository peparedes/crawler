apart from that i did see die hard with a vengeance again earlier on tv  

17. What's better: eternal love or memorable love?
Would it be possible for eternal love to not be memorable? I know that's answering a question with a counter-question, but well... <- i second that

get out of a warm bed

19. Best time of your life?

"event","good news - my grades had to be re-evaluated due to some work of mine 'turning up' from it's hiding place (not my fault thankfully!) and art history grade went from 64 to 80-something - and i was graded on work experience too (necessary)  so that just leaves sculpture. phew. it doesnt matter much if i pass or pass with distinction or merit, not for my cv. not with art. BUT it matters to me, who doesnt like to do well?

xmas tags made 
xmas wrapping - done - eek 
xmas cards ready to go - dear flip....

everyone agreed to let mum have her laptop as a joint bday/ xmas gift so she has it now. she was shell shocked. and she quickly found how addictive the net is! 

theres a lot i could say about the world news in recent months but really... i already know it goes on. i read it every day. i dont need to write about it all too. youd go mad. or be very depressed. 

i have so many plans this month, and i dont even really want to write about what i do anymore. ive noticed this trend among a lot of people. maybe it's something that happens with age... you dont feel you have to tell everyone you just went to the loo (ha, just kidding, i mean eg a party)"

"event","well the good news is in my pre-exams i passed. in some cases i didnt pass spectacularly but i did well with drawing and combined materials last may and i'm set to do well in paint. i did less spectacularly with art history appreciation, sculpture and as for design, i could have done way worse but a bit better too. But they are preliminary results (the drawing and comb. mat. are results set in stone) so they could change, i have the opportunity to improve on them by xmas. i cant really do anything about my art history app. score but i'm gonna focus on sculpture. because in doing that i can improve my design score at the same time. and to be honest i did enjoy art history appreciation, but it's not as important to me as say... paint. I think the fact tat while i enjoy sculpture I just don't feel the same fire within myself as i do with paint or even drawing, really reflected itself in my results. 
I also think it's more obvious now that I DO miss out on those group discussions the class have. More than anything I think it's their input, ideas and the briefings they get on what the tutors are looking for that I miss. I do think in future they should have an interpreter there for any deaf students. They neber did that for me because i'm not great at sign, im semi-ok.
The problem with sculpture - they never should have suggested i show my jewellery as my wire sculpture. Jewellery is a craft not art for art's sake which is what they want. And they also asked for a plaster sculpture relating to shoes and what i did was design a pretty shoe that was wearable and comfy, not murderous on the feet. which turns out to be not what they want. i think they wanted me to look beyond the shoe and do something FREAKY. 
So what i'll do is work on a wire sculpture design to replace my jewellery but i'll do something where i can incorporate the jewellery. It can't hurt to have both. 
I was very disappointed, i didnt question their marking of my work. I was disappointed in myself i guess. But i thought the pass rate waa 60. I felt less arsy about it when i found out it's actually 50, so i got 60 in sculpture and that's not dreadful. 

I was looking at mary's latest journal post about job hunting. Getting rejections and never being told WHY they rejected you. And i have to say 'we decided someone else was more suited for the job' doesn't really cut it. If they say you lacked in X and Y skills or presented yourself less than desirably in an interview (perhaps you answered questions about strengths and weaknesses in a very undesirable way) or basically don't just gloss over it. it could really help people, they could go on a course to brush up on a skill, or redirect their job hunting efforts to a different type of job, or just brush up on interview skills. 
i've felt the same.
i know it sounds like a big task for a company but lets say they only interview 20 people for a position. would it really kill anyone to give a sentence about WHY they rejected you?? it'd help the interviewee and i think itd help the interviewer understand exactly what they're looking for."

"event","its been one of those days, well its been one of those weeks really. you cant wait till its over and today i think its reached a head. everyone is 'Ergh' in the house. cant get a civil word most of the time! and for one i have (to be abstract) painter pain. so i have a stomach ache im not happy about. 
but the week wasnt a total loss, the days had the highlights even if they were fewer than usual. Had annual CT scan on wed and i drove to the hospital. Every learner has their share of frustration but by the time i got home i was so worked up i refused to park the car cos i kept arsing it up (they persuaded me to do it in the end) and i had kept my cool the entire way but dad hadnt, im not a saint thats gonna piss me off eventually! to be fair i was drifting like mad. 

My final assessment was this week (college) its not the official one but the internal one is like a pre-exam or a mock but more important cos the marks youre given are usually the same the examiner will give you when you have the official one. 
so on the surface of it it didnt seem a stressy week compared to the last one in may (2 months of hell) but i think subconsciously people were anxious. id say i was. probably one of the reasons for paragraph one - above. 

alot happened but i dont seem to write about it anymore. so rest assured the week had Stuff. 

i heard the deaf community had their own theatre - well its not in a real theatre but theres a stage at the deaf club. signed performances. no idea if the actors are deaf or not (i havent been) but i think they probably have actors who can sign and speak their dialogue rather than just an interpreter to the side of the stage. 
i also found out that the abbey theatre do new captioned performances. basically it means subtitles. handy for those not 100% on sign language. 
i think its great, i never realised how big the community really is. although it also shows how big the divide is. those born deaf and those who can hear rarely interact, you might get 'hi's' but not conversations. 
the deaf group at college even organised a separate meal for the grouy instead of going to the xmas party cps its always for the hearing. eg the main feature is live music. theres no interpreter for the raffle or speaches. so i can understand the need to do this. like i said, it just shows how big the divide is."

"event","occasionally i watch a show on sunday mornings, Australia's next top model. why? well, i like to see how they are advised to eg. work the light. it's not really the modeling i'm interested in but the foundation nitty gritty the have to work with like photography and themes. i also like the cat fighting haha.
Well today i saw something at the end of the show, a preview for next week, a model who is a size ten was told she wouldn't be put on a catwalk at a size ten. Perhaps there is more to it than that (i only saw a few seconds preview) but wow... size ten is small. The average size in the uk/ireland is 14 though reports always vary from 12 to 16. 10 is good, not big and not sickly small. An 8 or a 6 is however considered too small unless you are naturally petite and tall/slim.

i know the modeling industry is changing, ive heard things here and there like the report about a french fashion show that wouldnt allow people under 16 or something like that. and they opened the show with a string ofb size 14's. but obviously it is a thing that's changing slooooooowly. even if a catwalk still accepts size zero, to say a 10 is too big would be hilarious if it wasnt so serious. its not just size, people starve themselves and adversely affect their health, develop eating disorders and suffer depression to try to conform. 

unless the model is naturally thin (fast metabolism maybe) then it's just not natural beauty. it cant be a brilliantly happy existence. 
ive long understood catwalk fashion is quite often just an art. who'd wear most of that stuff on the street? but even then most women would appreciate seeing how clothes would look on THEM not on an ironing board frame. Just look at mannequins in a shop window. thyere always stupidly slim and how clothes sit on one of those will be very different to how they look on a real body. some women wont care about it but some do. And even if like me you couldnt give a flying duck about fashion trends there will come a time when you need something particular maybe for a special occasion or a new pair of trousers: you might see something 'perfect' for you on a mannequin but when you try it on its awful, pockets stick out or they wont go over bums and hips or sit oddly on boobs. that doesnt help your confidence no matter how well you know the clothes were just not designed for your shape. 

its a bit of a pet peeve, when i was a chubby teenager i had trouble finding trousers that went over my hips band ass, the larger tops i needed also tended to have big bust areas so my boobs were comically dwarfed. i grew out of the puppy fat when it was 20 and it went fast (for a while people wondered if i was sick!) so i had to replace my entire wardrobe (only a few things could be taken in) and i encountered a new problem. finding trousers that were long enough AND went over my butt (hey, its booty central), i still found tops can be stupidly large in the bust area but at least a few bstitches here n there sorted that ot. but when i was larger id see something perfect for a wedding on a mannq. and try it on and if i COULD get it on it looked awful. i had no choice with my debbs ball gown but to avoid sweets and fizzy stuff for weeks before the ball cos i had the largest dress in the shop and i really wanted that one (it was a 14/16) this was in the day you couldnt get much nice looking for a larger figure.   then when i suddenly lost it all and went looking for new clothes i did occasionally see something on a manneq that seemed a good staple, something that could be dressed up or down. id try it on only to find that despite my size im just not an ironingboard  like the mannequin. i care less about that than i did, im more confident. but if you arent having a good deay it'll hit you"

"event","finally, my response to the irish annual budget... it just keeps slipping my mind to write about it. so.... al in all people feel mugged by it and i see why. but on the other hand we knew hard decisions had to be made. 

the withdrawal or automatic medical cards to over 70's (to be replaced by means testing) - i understand to an extent what people are saying. that these older people have paid their dues. theve dragged the economy through rough times and paid taxes. but on the other hand its clear that with an aging population and a lower birth rate its not a sustainable practice. i do feel that if people were getting say, 1k a week from somewhere then its only fair, leave the medical card to those who really need it. so i support the idea in theory, its the (initial) means rates that the governments really messed up on. im not being hard hearted here, but with the way things are you have to be practical. look at the NHS as an example of how free healthcare for all doesnt work too good too. 

increased class sizes and teacher cuts - i think they should have left the kids alone. the class ratios are already too big in many places. when i was in school the average primary school class was 30 (a bit too many?) and in secondary it was 28. increasing that might not kill anyone but it will make it even harder to teach the classes and you can bet the teachers unions would seek a rise.... again. so not only does it adversely affect children it will in a roundabout way affect the budget. 

im not too worried about the tax increases on good, petrol could have been worse, i rarely drink wine and i dont smoke. they were the products most affected. you have to laugh..... the wine sales increase was dual purpose: to bring in the coffers but also to curb the perceived drink culture. there was no increase in the sales on beer and cider but there was 50 cent a bottle added to wine. can you imagine a gang of youngsters on a street corner guzzling a bottle of merlot? or even chardonnay. 

the levy - this was what annoyed me. 1% levy annually on all earnings below 100k and 2% on earnings above. WHAT? we already pay arseloads in prsi, vat and every other tax you can think of. lets say you earn 20k a year so you're levy bill would be 200 a year ( i hope my maths are right...) and lets say you earn 150k a year so your bill would be 3,000. if you earn that much a year it will still hurt to kiss goodbye to 3 thousand but 3 thousand will still seem almost like pocket change but 200 euro could be a months groceries for a small a struggling couple. so its like the less well off are paying for it when its the ricker who did well off the celtic tiger (when the economy was booming the only ones who really felt it were the well off) 

finally.... disability changes. they hhave done a uturn on a lot of the things in the budget..... the age where you can start receiving disability allowance is 16 but they changed that to 18 (and changed it back today). i got it at 16 myself. im in two minds about that. on the one hand most people are still in school at that age (say: most, i know some with disabilities cannot) so its not like a loss of earnings. on the other hand its a struggle for parents with kids who cant go to school. back to the other hand, its not like a loss of earnings even if they cant go to school because they are unlikely to be working at the age ogf 16 anyway. 
what im wondering is if that should have been changed so that people who go to school dont get the allowance but if you cant go to school or just arent there, you get the allowance. i guess the worry is people might abuse that and force youngsters to stay at home so they get DA and can pay their own way. DA is a lot more than child benefit. 
the final thought on that one - as far as i know a child benefit ends when the child is 16 or when they finish school unless they receive an allowance such as DA, then it also automatically ends. so if the child couldnt go to school and they lost the right to DA at age 16 and once the child hits 16 they dhe parents dont get child benefit because the child isnt in school, then until the child is 18 theyre harder done for money to support the childs needs. 

finally, i got it all down - i got on my soapbox a bit there"

or maybe not, but its exposure. a friend of mine at college let me know there was a pic of my stuff at that exhibition last month (art, jewellery and cards) in the irish deaf society news magazine which is sent to all members. nice. all exposure is good. i didnt know there'd be inclusion in that mag. im pretty pleased cos well.... it's an 'occurrence' and hell, you never do know. 
i also have something up my sleeve but i'll have to wait and see how that pans out before i say anything. it's also to do with crafts though;) 

im organising coffees and get-togethers left right and centre. it gets kind of neglected that kind of thing. and i think one particular friendship needs a bit of a kick up the arse, class is also no longer a place for anything more than a 5 min chat. i may well OD on starbucks! 
(or cookies...  i ate 8 gingerbread men today, theyre too tasty, with nutmet and cinnamon and mixe d spices (no ginger apparently!)....) 

i completely forgot about this over the weekend until one of my tutors (who wasnt in on fri) came up for a hug. I left a letter about it on the noticeboard you see. i told the story i read in the metro paper the day before. a petite middle aged woman and a tall 20 something man were on the DART (train) sat facing each other on the 8am train. the woman asks the guy to move his feet as he is spreading out onto hers and her feet were cramped. that turns into an arguement and gets heated. so the guy stands up and spreads out his arms and says 'i dont want to argue. do you want a hug?' to everyones amazement she stands up to hug him and people around them clap. so he says 'does anyone else want a hug?' and a man takes him up on his offer, so from there quite a few people hugged the person beside them. 
a nice way to start the day eh! 
and then this morning i saw anther letter saying if you tried to offer free hugs in most cities youd be decapitated, haha. 
i was saying im not the most huggy person, but a few days before i saw that a guy in my class was going around offering free hugs (hes known for doing it occasionally) and i was put out because i was painting at the time so i was too messy and didnt get a hug!"

"event","time for a change in journal layout, i like the circles. always like a good circle (old bag) 

i was saying today that it's so hard to translate what you wanna say into irish sign language. the sentence structure is soooooooooo different (like shorthand!) and they are not thick! but they do have a different level of english education than most hearing people. so they need it to be kept more simple. generally its safer to stick to general topics. 
my friend karen, who is deaf too, is another matter. she understands me because she knows me better, she understands my thought pattern (thats not common with hearing folk either!) so she somehow understands me even when i bollox up my sign language or am a bit iffy trying to explain what i mean and we can talk about more things. 

it doesnt help that there is no real way to convey irony. if you explain it to death, they might eventually get it but if you just say something ironic it doesnt look that way in sign, it confuses them. 

so i often confuse them with my words and visa versa! we get there in the end. the difference here than in general is, we are all deaf so we know how (fucking) annoying it is if someone says something and you dont understand so they say 'never mind'"

i was trying to figure out EXACTLY when i'd be in L.A as my ticket doesnt tell me, its just a 2 hour refuelling. well.... after a bit of hassle now i know. its pretty much halfway through the 27 hr flight - that doesnt include the 1.20 hrs to london, 3 hrs IN london and 1.45 hrs in LA - long journey - i'll probably want to hit the hay when i get there! 
Had to buy a new canvas bag (wheelie) - its spiffing. and green. and will fit plenty, how much space can X amount of bikini's take up? jk ;) 
its amazing how you need so many little things. its not exactly expensive per se but you need a fair few things - or i did. bag, new socks (they disappear!), some small toiletries for the plane (wet wipes etc)... well.... lotsa small things.  

anyhoo, i changed pain killers. i've been on lyrica a while, anyway i didnt even notice on the 'possible side effects' list was sleepyness. which may be why i was often so tired, its not normal 'jeeze im worn out' tiredness but 'durr.... zzzzz' and a bit wooly headed at times. so ive been trying neurontine for the last 2 days (im gonna give it a week) its much too early to say but so far im not 'durr......zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz''ing and im clearer headed. so if things keep going like that i'll go for the neurontine. its not as strong (supposedly) but it actually seems to work better on the pain itself. i dont even call it pain - its 'the leg....' that was a bit long winded

what else.... Project Get Dee Online is coming together well, the plan is to get mam a laptop and net connection so she isn't so .... bored. it's a long story but needless to say i think it'd benefit everyone in the house!

"event","i always see people complaining about eg. pregnant mothers car parking space, or special mother baby spaces, not holding the door open if you have a buggy, or holding the door for anyone. well its a long list.... some people do it but its amazing how many wont even consider helping, they pretend they cant see the person in need or feel they are in a rush so cant help etc. sometimes they dont even realise how their in-action affects the other. 

well i was on the luas (tram) and i got a seat, i usually dont as it fills pretty fast. as it pulled out of the city i saw an old lady and her husband at the back of the car. i got up and asked her did she want to sit down and she smiled and say yes thanks so i move towards the back of the car and she moved towards my seat when some tosser - guy is his late 30's early 40's runs past the woman and sits down in my seat. people see it and look disgusted but no one offered the lady their seat and believe me there were no other infirm people on this car. 
i hate confrontation especially with someone i dont know but this was so bloody rude i would have said something like 'excuse me i got up to let this lady have my seat so can you please let her sit down' but the guy was a real bruiser. one of those burly, shaven headed, imposing people with a real scowl. 

seriously though, isnt one of the first things we learn as a kid; give up your seat to someone who obviously needs it more? 
i could get into a rant about holding doors, leaving the special (wider) parking spaces to pregnant mothers (and wheelchair users), general good manners. but id better not or i'll be on a roll."

"event","close encounters of t he wheeled kind 
other cheesy movie titles

but it is a drama i'd like to remember - i feel terrible today but thats because i ate some dodgy sausages yesterday - i learnt a valuable lesson in where not to buy them. so i dont feel terrible because of what happened but id like to remember why: when im ill i usually joke about feeling like i was hit by a bus and its not so funny any more

it mustve been a day for close encounters neasa, i was standing at the corner with 2 of the girls from lipreading class on north frederic street waiting for the lights to change. i was on the outside nearest the corner itself.
you know how a car shell/chassis is slightly larger than their tyres? well a bus came along - a bit fast for the traffic - and the wheels brush off the edge of the path, so the bus itself brushes off me, a cm closer and i would have been a smear on the pavement
the a-hole didnt even have the excuse of 'skinny road'

same thing happened to mum once, in her wheelchair. also with a bus

on the plus side - tummy ache aside i'm doing grand. i was at a family do last weekend - took off my shoes and got chased by their cockrel and pecked on the feet as i ran for the trampoline in the garden :O 'a cock at you feet?' they say 
the work i have to do for next months final assessments is done but i better not say im finished or they will no doubt find some reason why i'm not haha.... 
treasure tree! - like how that strange sculpture turned out. 
shoe sculpture turned out very well but as a design its a bit boring to look at especially compared to the tree. 
i have this mental image of a tree for some time now! 

next sunday were at ste n mags for dinner, i'm beginning to wonder if i'll be busy every weekend before i'm #leaving on a jet plane..... # not that i mind! its certainly been busier the last few months. suddenly everyone feels social hehe ;) 

daytime tv - something that just happens to you if you feeling dodge. i was watching project catwalk (it was that, spongebob squarepants or high 5!) none of which id usually watch! (ooooooh its bones night i just realised :D) well, i was watching the designers - their creations. catwalk stuff can at times be quite artsy you know ;) i have a 'me = canvas' approach to dressing myself as well. 
what i noticed about the judges and designers - they tend to play it very safe with what they wear themselves. black suits, or black dresses, tops and skirts (again black), maybe some jeans but again a very safe looking outfit. its not just work clothing - if theyre at a fashion show you see the same thing. the only ones who really ventured out of safety was a gay fella and female hippy-eque. i understand theyre being very careful about what critique they get themselves as it could reflect their collections but as an example..... i have seen donatella verscars (sp?) in the media and that is not a woman who dresses in a way that appeals to most women and she really likes the platinum blond/orange tan thing but you can say this for her - she does it how SHE wants it and her label is very very successful anyway. i wondered if she was a rare example of this working or are designers and fashion judges really really playing it too safe. what if they at least wore something they designed themselves? 
i must be very bored today if i gave it that much thought! 

i am howver utterly b*ll*xed so i'm going for a rest"

"event","i almost hvae to force myself to write here these days. its like they say - the busier life is, the less you have to write. maybe not because you havent exactly got time but youre too tired to be arsed! 

but there are things i wouldnt like to forget even if i only really share basic shit! yesterday was a bit of a mare at college - problem with someone that comes and goes. its like being mentally stripped. so i wasnt bouncing off the walls when i came home! but i was better today, too arsing tired to be in a mood or negative probably! my iron levels are still horribly low - just barely above bad. thats probably why!

weve all been posting old pics of facebook, not just old kiddie pics but old family pics. some of us are not amused at the hairdo's we sported - oy. i had a shirley temple poodle perm when i was 8... 9 ? wow..... but thats nothing compare to the family hair - its big.... its bold... its curly.... its hairy! 
i spose some of the pics WERE from the 80's so.... ;) 

travel socks.... 
i have to be all practical and plan my travel to a T. it really isnt that far off. so... i went looking for flight socks - they help prevent DVT and improve circulation on long haul flights. problem was the only socks i saw were all 15 - 20 euro. part of the problem is most places have put travel stuff away to make room for halloween or christmas stuff. so theyre not that easy to come by. mum spotted a pair in the socks section of Dunnes (hm... i suppose a US equiv. might be KMart) for 5 euro! score.... im keeping any expenses as low as possible."

"event","hey thats an interesting movie title :P

a bit of a girlie post but... well i got an epilator because every time i shaved my legs it was like torture. i always managed to hurt my ankles and last time i hurt the knee too! i knew if i went on like that id end up looking like an Igor, so i considered other options. salon waxing is silly expensive, i find the home ones hurt more and theyre pretty expensive too, hair removal cream doesnt work on thicker hair and id rather be smooth than bleached so i got an epilator. like a razor with lots of tweezers on it. when i suggested getting one everyone said they hurt like hell and you get stubble etc but i wonderd if half of them were repeating what THEYD heard - you know.... story about an elephant, by the tenth time its repeated its a dinosaur.... 
but i did expect it to hurt a lot more than it did. the manual suggests you try a less hairy area to get used to the sensation before you attack the legs, so i tried my forearms. id never even shaved those... now theyre baby smooth - i have tried it a few times to be sure. its fecking great. i do have a high pain thershold (i probably need one) but i find after a minute i quite like the sensation :O (freak) 
it was 70 euro - you can get them for 50 but i thought the one with the cooling kit sounded best - in the long run it'll save a fortune. 
no stubble here btw! the first time you use it youre pretty red so the manual suggests you do it at night so the redness is gone by the morning - you have a few small bumps at first too but they wear off with the redness.
i thought id share the experience, there're so many scare stories about them. 

last night was culture night in the city, galleries and museums, poetry and acting houses, the eco shop etc loads of places stay open from 6-11pm. theres a free culture bus to get around it all and the dublin fringe festival was coming to a close so temple bar was very lively. i felt like a celebrity arriving at the irish museum of medorm art and the decorative arts museum at colins barracks! it was dark and the colins barracks one was all lit up. i just happened to arrive at both when they had professional photographers taking nighttime pics of arriving visitors. so as i cross the courtyard i was papped repeatedly by a very large flash. i wondered if i should have vogued(!) 
im glad i went, there arent many opportunities to get out at night time trhat doesnt involve the pub! (i.e i dont get out at night much) 

tomorrow is the all ireland football GAA match and mum is going, eimears up from klerry so were meeting in their flat later."

"event","thats what ive had on the brain today. i told mum it seemed a bit coincidential that while the economy must have been winding down for a while it seemed a bit funny that it all went to hell after the lisbon treaty fiasco. suddenly the media has gone mad for it. 
well this was what she had to say - its mainly the property section that is the problem. many banks loaned very irresponsibly for quite some time and now were all paying for it. they get big bonuses when they secure loans or perhaps theyre performance related quarterly bonuses but the point she made is that this made the banks a bit careless. 

i dont think thats the whole reason for the crunch but it does sound right. the property sector has been a huge thorn in the irish economy's side for years - with growing rates and its almost impossible to get on the property ladder these days. even if youre a 30-something professional. but the whole world is experiencing very real economical trouble - look at what happened to the japanese stock market the other day and AIG in the us.... then recall the Northern Rock story in the uk.
the dollar had weakened considerably against the euro and were having problems with oil prices. maybe thats what it all comes down to. but its hard to see how that alone could cause such trouble?..... 
mind you right now my brain is shouting oil, oil, oil, oil : raw oil,  plane fuel,  petrol"

last week i took a brain training numbers game on the bus... i must not have hit mute right and a guy in front turns around and stares till i turn it off - so i dont take it now. no way to  know if the sound is off. 
but i realised the tiredness i get is really motion sickness - its not getting sick but nauseous, dizzy and tired. mostly just on the bus. reading is a no no..... well i realised because if my brain was busy with the game it didnt happen. the idea that deaf people cant get motion sickness is crap.

so ive had stuff on exhibition for the last two days :D tomorrow is the last day. its nothing hugely fancy but any exposure is good exposure.  its art, jewellery and cards - a deaf skills exhibition.
i went yesterday and got lot for 2 hours :O felt a right tit but in the end i was just glad i found it! 
ill call again tomorrow but i might take the bus(!)

college is insanely busy but im on top of it - bestr place to be - on top :P moving on from impressionism to a drawing project that will ultimately lead to plaster sculpture - shoes. 
the atmosphere is much better than it was before summer by a long shot. i find my own attitude counts for a lot! i think these days i look less gloomy in the face. 
I needed to renew my travel pass - free pass - sent it off. i had to buy a travel pass last week and another this week. 18 quid a pop :O i hope it arrives soon! travel aint cheap!"

then i did what i often do - contact my inner child and went on the bouncy castle (or i should say someone threw me on it and i couldnt be fecked to move!) i spent all my time on my arse. and if youre on your arse youre gonna get X amounts of misc. kids on top of you. i actually managed to accidentally roll off the thing a few times. only to be thrown back on. i gave in and stayed there, it seemed to amuse the kids anyway."

i paid and left oblivious to what id just done. 
i got home and let my dad know i had vaseline cos he often asks me for it for one of the kids nappies or something. i then mentioned my lucky find of latex gloves..... they all broke out in complete hysterics and i nearly died when i realised 'uh oh WHAT did the guy n the shop think, the shame :O'"

"event","i forgot to metion im working on an imp. project. well.... its been hell to start! impressionism is easy enough to explain but harder to create with paint at least when you start out. A real head banger. Well it's better now I feel like i have a grip of it. the handy thing is impressionism is pretty much my own favored style of painting. it has never been very easy to recreate a painting never mind a masterpiece like the one im working with (carnation, lily,lily, rose by sargent) these guys are masters for a reason. 
i'm getting somewhere with it. 

i was talking to a tutor for a while today and i appreciate that she is only trying to help and in the long run her constructive criticism helps me. it pushes me. but that knowledge doesnt stop you from feeling a bit shite if you are totally dressed down. i did say i was finished with the project, thats probably what got to me. like i say it helps in the long run."

"event","its official. the new brand of yellow paint doesnt agree with me - ... but im fecked if i'll waste the tube because it gives me a headache, heavy face, dead legs.... its a nice shade of yellow too :P 

more official stuff - my trip to NZ has been booked. Im off on holiday :D not till right after xmas but time is flying. This has been in planning several months. it cost a lot but if youre gonna travel do it right, lol. 6 weeks of wintertime sunshine. weve had such a shite summer, i'll have to chase the sun around the world. 
i'm gonna visit some family of my grandmothers when im there and meet up with donna (cousin , just a tad younger) if she's still in NZ at the time. 
the funny - amusing thing is. There's a new deaf student at college on the photography course. guess where he's from, go on, guess. havent met him, i heard it through the grapevine. the age demographic is pretty huge so he could be 18 or 80 lol. 

im gonna be at an exhibition on the 10th - i'll be exhibiting :D its an exhibition of craft bby deaf people. photography, art, crafts etc. well i;ll be showing a few bits of art and some jewellery and cards too. cos cards are crafts... any exposure is good! its also hard to get exhibitions unless you have some kind of history of exhibiting but you cant get a history unless they let you do it. its like the ebay feedback conundrum."

it didnt make matters any better that several people had managed to honk me off - by not responding to emails for weeks etc. most of the emails were just 'how are you? are you ALIVE? have you had the surgery yet?' etc. at least it turned out in most cases it was down t lack of net access over the holidays! 

i still feel like rubbish though, the smell of the cooking - yeugh.... 
its been one of those days. the kind youd like to sleep through. 

but it wasnt a total waste. im working on an impressionist project right - so im on colour theory at the mo. it was a real head banger.... explaining imp. techniques is quite simple. but creating them is another matter. i made a breakthrough when i got it through my exceptionally THIN skull that it comes down to shadow colour. 
ger rolled in this afternoon - great to see her - or it would have been if i didnt feel like a zombie at the time. but i soon perked up - we were chatting for about half an hour..... or i should say i did 80% of the chatting.

i had been throwing the twins in the air (they're 2 years old nearly 3) so i was a bit wrecked and sat down. mary and nathan dived. but nathan cant compete with the space mary takes up, he's a slip of a thing i can still hold up above my head! 
well... mary got a bit excited (as opposed to frustrated which is why i usually get bitten) and bit me. in a very sore place to bite. the inner thigh is sacred. or at least it should be from teeth! im used to her biting me on the leg, bum or even arm. 

she's a real handful for her mum. and has been biting since before she even had teeth. normally she doesnt bite adults but apparently im fair game! i thought maybe she got frustrated that i cant hear her and maybe she is telling me to stop (eg. blowing raspberries on her stomach or throwing her on the couch) but she does it when excited too. she bites her brother and sister to try get people's attention so im not sure what the story is there. i'm tempted to get her a muzzle ha. its not exactly bad, im pretty quick at pulling her off before she can really bite hard and can generally avoid situations that cause her to bite but i do wonder what the heck goes through her skull. ive never known a child with a a cannibal streak that big."

Ireland never really does well but we usually manage a medal or two. shame sonya sullivan is retured! 

i like the olympics believe me i do, its a good concept. but the home team always has an advantage - china is top of the table just like the usa was last time. which might not be too bad but countries with the most money - to send their best athletes - usually own the medals board. Eg countries like Togo are lucky if they get a bronze. I doubt its because they have no good athletes. Bigger countries might have money for better training its true but there you see where money comes into it again. i know.... a bit cynical. but im not slating the olympics, i'm pointing out where it is less fair. mind what sport is entirely fair?

mind you there is one consideration - the bigger the country the more athletes they have to chose from

that doesnt take anything away from the athletes - they worked their ass off to get where they are. whether or not theyre from china, usa, russia or togo."

bargain hunting seems to run in the genes. all the women in my family are brilliant at finding spanking great bargains.... the other week i got some great comfy dresses for 1 euro each - and some t shirts. 

well this morning bridie (family friend) was here qas usual for a thursday - in a flap because she had her nieces wedding on saturday and she had looked everywhere for a top or dress with no joy. well she tried on some of my clothes but i think mine were probably too..... young. no one can accuse me of flashing the flesh but she is very body self conscious. 
so i was in stillorgan, had to go to tesco and the post office so i had a look in the shops there....
she had very specific needs i thought.... nothing too tight or hugging.  shooulders and arm tops had to be covered. also chest area - shouldnt expose too much cleavage, she was also worried about people seeing her belly (she hasnt GOT one!), no loud patterns, plainer would be better. so during my hunt i spot a brill black chiffon (over silk) top with half sleeves - there are coppery coloured beads around the arms, end and neck. its not too plungy. and i spot a necklace in gold with black - looks like an animal fur pattern. top was 45 euro reduced to 5 euro and the necklace was 10 reduced to 3. 
i do love a bargain!"

here are the most common topics (possibly) 

1. Being chased
2. Missing an important event because you are late
3. Finding yourself at school or work naked
4. Falling
5. Flying
6. Losing your teeth
7. Snakes

well....
<lj-cut text='im dreaming of a.....'>
I too have never really had many dreams about being chased (i can think of 2 in the last ten years) and never for being late for an event, never been naked. But falling and flying have been common enough dreams for me and as for snakes - as a kid i had snake-mares a lot. I was terrified of them. so i often dreamt i tried to kill em lol. 

being late for something - well no ive never (to my knowledge) dreamt ive been late for something but i HAVE been in a rush to get ready for my wedding to try get there on time - in several dreams. 

ive had bizzare dreams starring a crush - now its not all sex :P its mostly about talking. one time i dreamt he was writing on a blackboard and i was sat on a students chair at the front. i was a bit funny when i realised the students were still in the class! 

escaing things - thats been a common one since i was a kid. its not so much about being chased but about evasion and getting out of eg a building or game or fair  ground. 

one very strange recurring dream (occasionally) is im underwater and panicking about breathing but once i stop panicking i realise i am ok. its not like im breathing normally but i find the water isnt drowning me. perhaps those dreams suggest i imagine shit will be worse than it is :P lol 

my dreamland is so often a strange place - you probably wouldnt wanna go there :O these dreams have been very tame! (above) </lj-cut>"

Mainly because its an issue i dont want to make statements about because i made it all official.

Niamh decided to stay till tomorrow (was due to go home tuesday) - her sister Jean is coming up from kerry to go shopping in dublin. i have to play tour guide again haha. well. i could just make sure they get from the train station to the shops but it's something to do if i hang around a bit. I can always leave if they get manic about the shopping. 
Sharing your living space is often a good lesson! 

Since ive been on holiday ive been watching way more tv than usual. Charmed. ive never watched that so much before! but actually it grates on my nerves how demon cole always gets away with it - its pretty addictive!

Only some of the family were at it but it was nice to get out/ problem was i was sooooo tired so i sat at the back of the church rather than with the family - in case i fell asleep - and its embarrassing when i do the nodding dog thing :P lol. So while only a third of the family were there, kathryn and her hubby and kids were over from the uk. Dear god the Niamh Mark 2 is so cute its scary. Those baby curls.... they brown eyes. Pity i was too tired to do more than sit there! 

Annemarie finally popped! a boy on the 30th of july (i think) Christopher Gabriel. Omg the cuteness - the family is spawning a legion of cuties at the mo. worrying. 

picasso came in today with a bird (sparrow i think....) - i dunno how she did it. but if she makes a habit of it ill make her wear a collar with a bell. 

Cool thing - Niamh started learning the signed alphabet (the irish one) on friday. i have it on my bebo page you see (which i never use these days - it was a way to keep in touch with younger cousins) - she already knows most of it :O i know there arent that bloody many letters in the alphabet but wow..."

"event","i popped into the central library to do some browsing in the art and crafts section. supposedly the C.L is the best place for art books but i think they MUST have streamlined since i was there a couple of months ago. The books i came across were all older - so even if they had illustrations (can be very important with crafts!) they are not very good and few and far between. I wonder if - it being summer with students from all over the place are in ireland - the books have all been reserved/ordered out. ah well,,,,,, wasnt a total waste. some of the older books are good if they have decent illustrative drawings ;) 
its not that old books are bad - no way - its that what they DID have wasnt really helpful.

the other day i was watching a biopic (film) called Frida - based on Frida Khalo's life. She was a very forward thinking mexican artist (mexican mother and jewish father i think) 
she had an amazing life, i dont know how she ever got through the accident she had when she was 16. Basically a very very bad bus crash - a steel bar went though her pelvis - owie..... she couldnt walk but somehow learned to do it again. Then she married and although she knew he wasnt gonna be faithful he really pushed the limits. they divorced and for some reason remarried. she died fairly young i think..... 
its a very sad story really.... glad i stayed up to watch it but ive read her story so i filled in some gaps (eg in reality she had 2 miscarriages or maybe more..... in the film she had 1) 
she was very talented. Not everyone understands her work but what makes it stand out is it comes from within. it deals with emotion. and no one could deny her skill with a paintbrush. 

the auction raised 430 euro in the end! 

i have a spiral painty thingie. i saw it for 2 euro in the euro store and thought 'itd be a great way to use up the mountain of paper scraps i have....' i really have no idea what you'd call it. i had a big one as a kid. you put a page in it and hit the spinner button and pour in paint as it sp[ins...."

so to celebrate i had a vanilla latte (remember i dont DO regular coffee - i probably have enough hairs on my chest!) and window shopped. I never used to appreciate the power of a simple browse but it has its pluses ;)"

"event","I was going to do a card with Frogtastic (birthdauy <- the last word would be small) - its a funny story. A woman i made cards for 2 years ago was bidding in the auction and won a few things and got in touch to say her son (who is 40 and frog mad) loved his 40th bday card 2 years ago and last year she gave him a shop bought card. he said it wasnt as good. So she asked me for 5 frog themed ones for him so she wont forget for the next few years haha. im on card 4 atm. I was gonna use the pc to make a froggy wallpaper and paste it onto the Frogtastic text - the same as i did for a pc geek's 40th bday card but this was also two years ago. I cant for thelife of me remember how i did this.... i know i used a couple of programmes (i know i used word, i also have coral photo 5 and paint shop pro 9. im fairly sure i did the actual wallpapering in word..... i also use the ms Paint. never let a basic programme go to waste ;) 
i came up with an alternate idea - still using Frogtastic but the decorating will be frogs and words i have rather than the cool thing i hadin mind. But its gonna annoy me till i figure it out."

Run down i suppose. a bit better now than i was today so thats a start. maybe the 'nap' helped. Point is, ive been feeling peaky today. I do hate having to sleep in the afternoon but when the body wants to you havent really got a choice ;) 

i was up the shop looking for a new pack of pants. i threw a load of old ones out because they were worn to a cm of their life or had holes. did the shop have a rush on medium sized panties???? they only had size 18+ in the kind i wanted. I dont want floral tents! 

sharing apacket of biscuits with homer. (thats dad in case you forgot ;)) i said to him 'watch it, those are really fractured biscuits. they fall apart in your hands. i love to lick the cream off mine and thats hard to do when the crumble in your hand' now i was partly aware that what i said would come out bold - and i cant help it if thats actually TRUE! - but still. Bold.

the atmosphere in college had gotten better for the last 2 days so maybe the stress has abated... it was really horrible for weeks. Problem with being deaf is you can read body language like a book so while most people not generally notice if you stare daggers (but smile while you do it to try hide it) - i do! 
So ive been feeling much more bouncy the last few days. you know how those kinda atmospheres affect you even if you yourself arent stressed by the work. 

The auction is up at running (for one week)! lots of work involved, almost forgotten how much i like doing them despite that. i like to be busy. i know where i am when im busy! 
already have a nice bid on an artists phoenix print! 

Although today did start off a bit sketchy - i keep waking up feeling sick the last week. i think its just that i keep waking through the night but at the same time i sleep like the dead when i DO sleep so its a bit strange.... wears off after a brew anyway ;) (well, maybe TWO brews) 

I drove over to Tallaght with the parents last weekend and i'll be out again tomorrow in another area - its all to get good practice with different driving conditions. i've gotten good at it since the practice has become more intense and i have the automatic car. 
I know you mightn't know what i mean unless you drive yourself but its a great feeling to drive. the freedom of being able to go where you will (not being limited to wherever public transport deigns to go) and the handling of the car itself.....

ive decided not to bother trying to sell any more plushies because it's just not working with ebay - i think i mentioned this. As i said the problem is probably feedback but im not buying stuff just to get feedback, the idea is to make a bit of petty cash not spend it. I only sold one and it was for a little girl who wanted it (probably not actually a neo-fan) orange kougra - its a shame because i have a lot of rare older plushies that would go down well. 
I have no idea how else i might sell them."

been a long day but a good day, was in the supermarket with Bee, we shouldnt have bothered with brollies because we both had to get changed when we got back anyway. course, now the rain has more or less stopped.
atvarious stages i had mary or nathan hanging off me, im so shocked.... how can twin (2 year olds) be so different? mary is very bulky and actually a bit too heavy and nathan is like a rake, he even needs smaller baby clothes, hes very light. sometimes i wonder how theyre even related! nathan would laugh at anything but 80% of the time mary is hard to please and quite irritable. 
its funny really!  

feedback from internal review - work = powerful 
great at capturing animals emotionally 
a real sensitivity and understanding towards how i depict them
i do tend to work too fast as i said - so i need to slow down and id do even better 
very pleasing results 

i was gonna go to an exhibition tomorrow evening but i dont think i can. busy evenings these days.... 
shame because i like the artists work! 

been finding time to read more lately, a thing i havent had much time to do but im trying, i miss it. it felt a bit weird at first! sitting still and actually focusing on a story that wasnt 'me' lol. and ive been a book worm for years....
the wild road - gabriel king. i first read it when i was 14 i think - 10 years ago, wow. its not that its a fantastic plot but well.... i could bang some of the characters heads together but im finding that with tv and even rl lately, lol. its captivating in the way i find many books to be, not because theyre great but because i dive into them."

"event","i came in this evening and ate everything in sight. i was just more tired than i realised, i didnt even doze on the bus as i often do. perhaps i was over tired? it was a roller coaster of a day - up n down. hardly anyone in class today and there was no let up on the stressy atmosphere weve had for weeks. yesterday was assessment day for many so you might have thought itd get better, you would be wrong lol. or perhaps its just because of the people who were in they were just still busy. its been a iffy atmosphere to work in for weeks - tense i suppose. 

good news - i was assessed too but well.... they didnt have to look at my work much as theyve been doing that on the go. They told me i had most of my work for novembers assessments - i just need
*to collate my life drawing into a notebook
*to do an impressionism project (ive started the basic mostly written work so far*
*i can show some of my jewelery as part of the design module and a notebook backtracking the process of design on a few pieces 
*a sculpture in wire and a sculpture in plaster 
other than that - atm im finishing up the last page of my cats project. im trying to keep it slower as i tend to work too fast which works to my benefit in most things but not in art it appears! my work is powerful im told. but would be even more so if i took a bit more time. at least im told im very sensitive to the subject i focus on (cats and dogs) - recreating their images, with emotion etc. good feedback. very useful. 

i cannot wait till it gets less tense an atmosphere at college. it makes you afraid to say two words to people. and the added problem is a deaf person can read body language like a book."

Thats ok, thats new years.... but xmas is another kettle of fish. 
it all started with me saying i hadnt a clue what to get brianna for her bady, she will be five. and ive already made a little necklace for her before and she doesn't need more! so mum suggested arty stuff as she loves to draw (methinks its partly a Petra Impersonation but shes creative in her own right!) 
Then mum had a brainwave. the warehouse they were at at the weekend would be 'perfect for your xmas shopping' well apart from what i'm making myself (ann n pat are getting a painting, granny is getting Petra-made pearl earrings i think.... 

Already having mentioned it is a bit much! even though its a good idea to start early to a. get people nice gifts and B. avoid spending a fortune on stuff. xmas is never the spendfest for me that it is for some and i have to say that is because i plan ahead but it does sound a bit preachy! i dont like having to plan ahead! it is too bloody frequent! lol. what happened to xmas seeming like that magical time, time off school, food in abundance and it always seemed soooooooooo far away and so rare as a child?!"

Procastinating a bit today. I just havent felt up to card making but i didnt need to make any anyway. I did actually make one in the end. get it out of the way. I slouched - well... STOOD in front of the tv most of the day lol. And read. I dont read much these days. Too busy really. But its a bit depressing lol... because it is easy for someone with a very active imagination to find parallels in a story with their OWN story. although the characters being plunged into happy couple hell at a dinner gathering was just funny :P 

The folks went to Tullamore to some bargain warehouse. Now I do like a good bargain. Its in the genes..... shopping. I am a woman. But... im not as mad on it as i w as. Partly because i'm saving every red cent (or whatever colour they might be!) but partly because i just dont find i need to shop to get a fix. lol.

Ah well you live and learn.

its not about being able to push back. its just basic manners and courtesy - and queues! 
i was pissed off and amused at the irony at the same time. 
it isnt usually quite that crowded and people arent usually as pushy and queue jumping. though its usually still packed.

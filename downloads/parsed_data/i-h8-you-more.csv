"event","ok so today at my school they had a guest speaker..two in fact.... and i got to the auditiorium and i was like yeah yeah whatever its all gonna be bullshit but then the men started to talk...they spoke about the hardships they had both had  had to go through to get where they were now.. and it hit me..



what the fuck am i doing with my life?


and as they drawled on i started to relize that this whole of deal of being sad about something i had no say in...it wasnt worthwhile...i was wasting my time, wasting my life...and its an epiphany...i just felt the self pity and the anger melt away....i am healthy and so is my family


we may have our problems but i have people who love me, i have friends who like me, i am smarter than like half the kids my age but im letting all my talent go to waste

and i figured out that i dont have time to waste on regretting things.,...on never saying what i meant to..of letting thank you's and i love you's go bye..because i am already through with 15 years of my life and what do i have to show for it? i am going to make a difference..in my life....in the world


i am not going to go unnoticed anymore


i feel so ..........settled like...i know that my life is hard..it is hard for me to deal with people and i do have a tendency to get anxious and depressed but i am not going to let that dark side rule me anymore


i am going to win over my bad habits i will succeed and if i get upset..i am not going to freeze and wait for somebody to rescue me..

i can do this                    i can live my life              i can succeed


and it feels great..knowing that i have the power to change my life...maybe not immeditely but i can do it

i can do it


to all my friedns who have been there for me when i have been so upset and moody


i love you


and to all the boys that made me feel so insecure and ugly

i dont care anymore i really honestly dont i am going to stop looking for somebody to complete me..i am ok as i am...i can do this without somebody to lean on i have a bunch of great friends...i am NOT going to look anymore..if somebody happens along then so be it..if not then i will still be ok

i can do this

i CAN"

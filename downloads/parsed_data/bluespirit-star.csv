We&#39;ve had a surveyor out to look at the bungalow for us &amp; everything seems to be good.&nbsp; There were a couple of issues - one with the chimney &amp; a potential one with the drains that required us getting further reports done, but the results have come back with a positive (just some repair work to the chimney but nothing major.)&nbsp; I&#39;m really glad that we went ahead &amp; got the surveys done (there was no legal requirement as we&#39;re not having a mortgage, but it&#39;s good for our peace of mind!)

We&#39;re going to view again tomorrow to finalise a few things with our vendors (they&#39;re doing some alterations for us in the utility/mud room) &amp; also to measure up for curtains, etc.&nbsp; It&#39;ll be nice to see inside the place again (I have been around &amp; looked through the windows! *g*)

So, the legal side of things seems to be chugging along, &amp; I hope we can hear something about the exchange of contracts soon. *fc*

In the meantime, we&#39;re doing a lot of decluttering &amp; getting things sorted - donating things to charity, etc &amp; getting ready to start packing stuff up.&nbsp; It&#39;s amazing how virtually everything that we&#39;d carefully stored away up in the loft has now been recycled/donated/thrown out! LOL

With that in mind, I have my John &amp; Rodney action figures going free to a good home, if anyone would like them.&nbsp; I&#39;m just asking for the postage costs please.&nbsp; (They seem to have lost their guns, etc &amp; are not boxed - they&#39;ve spent all of their time wrapped around each other kissing!)

In other news - no Supernatural to share this week, I&#39;m afraid. :(

Hope everyone has a great weekend!

We helped out on the LRSEC stand - raising awareness of the charity &amp; getting donations.
Bud was an absolute star &amp; people loved him! There were several offers to take him home - I had to explain that he was my dog &amp; if they wanted to adopt him, they&#39;d have to adopt me, too! *g*
It was a really lovely day, &amp; I was so proud of my silly boy .
We had six happy-ending rescue dogs on the stand (including Bud) &amp; there were people coming around all day long. It was so busy that apart from giving Bud a couple of comfort breaks, we worked the stand all day. So, I didn&#39;t get to do any shopping at any of the great doggie-related stalls or to see any of the events going on.&nbsp; Never mind - I had so much fun talking about Bud all day!
It was rather tiring though, &amp; when we got home, we both flaked out! *g*

I never thought that I&#39;d be able to say that Buddy had been to Crufts! *g*

The legal wheels are now in motion (we got a huge pile of documents to read, fill in &amp; return this morning) &amp; hopefully things will run fairly smoothly &amp; we should be moving in a couple of months. *fc*

The property is being flipped by a developer, &amp; so everything has been refurbished - new wiring, plaster, windows, doors, bathroom, kitchen, boiler, central heating - it&#39;s like a brand new home. I&#39;m actually so relieved as I really didn&#39;t fancy taking on any big reno projects. *g*

*hugs*

<lj-cut text=""a quick update on me"">

I know that I&#39;m rather late with the New Year greetings, but things have been so busy here.
We&#39;re still in the same position house-wise as before - we&#39;ve accepted an offer on our house but the lady is still to sell her own. That means that we&#39;re still on the market &amp; so are having other people come around for viewings. We had 5 over the weekend &amp; already there are 2 more booked in for tomorrow.&nbsp; I just find having people coming to see the house a bit stressful. Plus, I&#39;m rather OCD &amp; the levels of cleaning are getting astronomical!&nbsp; We did actually have one couple comment that they&#39;d never seen such a clean house in their lives!
We still haven&#39;t found the right property to move to. The one that we did make an offer on (which was accepted) we then lost because someone else came along &amp; they were all ready to go as they were sold.&nbsp; So, we&#39;re keeping on looking.
I&#39;m sure the right house is out there &amp; that things will work out for the best in the end. :)

Also, I&#39;ve been getting a bit bogged down inside my head &amp; retreating from the world for a while, &amp; I really need to tackle that.&nbsp; It&#39;s a warning sign &amp; I don&#39;t want to start backsliding into depression again.&nbsp; I really need to interact on LJ more &amp; start to feel some fandom joy.&nbsp; And with that in mind, <lj user=""lantean_drift"" /> &amp; KB are coming around tonight for pizza &amp; a rewatch of The Abominable Bride. Awesome!</lj-cut>

I hope that 2016 is treating everyone well so far &amp; that you&#39;re all healthy &amp; happy!"

<lj-cut text=""more..."">As it was my birthday (I had an official HP birthday badge! *g*), I got to help open the huge doors into the Great Hall. It was so exciting.&nbsp; The hall was decorated for a Halloween feast &amp; looked amazing.

Okay, &amp; then I sort of ran away! LOL

We rode brooms in the green screen area (<lj user=""lantean_drift"" /> has my pic from there, I&#39;ll post it when I get a copy!) &amp; flew in the Weasley&#39;s Ford Anglia (I got to drive &#39;cus I was the birthday girl! *g*)&nbsp; Next we went to Platform 9 &amp; 3/4!

We&#39;re putting our house on the market, &amp; I just wanted to spruce it up a bit.
We&#39;ve lived here for twenty years &amp; it&#39;s a lovely home, &amp; in one way I&#39;ll be sad to leave (oh, my gorgeous new kitchen &amp; bathroom!)&nbsp; But we&#39;ve decided that we need to move to a bungalow.&nbsp; Bud&#39;s nearly ten now, &amp; despite being fighting fit, I do worry that he may eventually have trouble with the stairs.&nbsp; This happened with Rascal in the last year or so, but as he slept downstairs, he didn&#39;t mind.&nbsp; But Buddy sleeps upstairs (in our room) &amp; I know that he&#39;d be very distressed if he couldn&#39;t climb the stairs.&nbsp; So, we&#39;re going to move to a single story home - hopefully it&#39;ll be our final home &amp; so it&#39;s future-proofing us for old age, too! *g*

So, better go &amp; finish painting the fence! (Aaagh - we have a huge garden &amp; so much fence! *g*)

On Sunday, we went to the annual Dogs&#39; Party for the Lab rescue who brought us our beautiful Bud.
We had such a great time! So many gorgeous Labs to meet &amp; snuggle, a fun dog show, stalls with so much doggy-themed stuff, bbq, cakes, &amp; even some sunshine!
What a lovely day.
Bud entered 4 categories in the fun show &amp; won 3 rosettes! We came first in the sausage &amp; spoon race! (&amp; Bud got to eat the sausage at the end), 5th in the &#39;most handsome dog&#39; &amp; 5th in the fancy dress!&nbsp; (I made Bud&#39;s costume &amp; was pretty pleased that it stood up well against the store bought ones.)

We road-tripped through Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi &amp; down to New Orleans.&nbsp; Lots of Civil War battlefields &amp; museums, a little hiking, a lovely trip on a paddlesteamer &amp; zooming through the bayous on an airboat spotting &#39;gators! Woohoo! Tremendous fun.

We also visited the ruins of an antebellum plantation house that had been destroyed by fire in the 1890s.&nbsp; Only the huge, intricate pillars remain.&nbsp; It was so atmospheric. We loved it.

Windsor Ruins, nr. Rodney, Mississippi:

LJ keeps dumping me out &amp; then not letting me log back in (claims it doesn&#39;t recognise my name or password!)
So, while I am actually logged in (not sure why it let me in this time) I wanted to share my latest sewing project.
It&#39;s a 50&#39;s inspired halter dress which I do rather love.&nbsp; I chose a retro looking fabric &amp; am so happy with the way it turned out (despite me having to put the zip in about 5 times! LOL)

I wrote the first draft last week while Bud &amp; I had a super week by the sea with various lovely friends including <lj user=""lantean_drift"" />, <lj user=""xanthe"" />, <lj user=""carnelianred"" />, <lj user=""saffron1"" /> &amp; <lj user=""battyoldflapper"" />.
We hired a beautiful house in Southwold, only 5 mins walk from the beach. It was smashing &amp; so relaxing.
While there, I shocked <lj user=""saffron1"" /> by mentioning that I&#39;d never read any Harry Potter (&amp; I&#39;ve only seen the first 2 films. *g*)&nbsp; Being the only non-Potter person there, I decided to give The Philosopher&#39;s Stone a go... I&#39;m now halfway through The Order of the Phoenix!!&nbsp; I&#39;m absolutely loving them!

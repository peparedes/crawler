"event","1. Would you rather kill a puppy with your bare hands or make out with your father?:
Make out with my dad. It would be the only chance I got to throw up on him with a reliable excuse.

2. What would be worse for the world: One giant (approx. 30 feet tall), cybernetic Hitler, or if all food screamed when you ate it?: My food technically already screams at me...

3. Zombies become a very harsh reality. Sensing the ethical code society has instilled in you slipping away, you decide to start killing everything that moves with what weapon?:
A car. Zombie-bowling.

4. When charging into battle, your war cry is?: HOLLAR!!!!!


5. A temporal rift has opened up while you were in the bathroom and sucked you into the distant, distant past. Where do you pray to God that you don't end up?:
hmm....2003.

6. Ninjas vs. Pirates:
Canons vs. Swords.....I rest my case..

7. Its your wedding day. However, the night before ants crawled into your head and drove you insane. What song is stuck in your head?
""The ant's go marching down the isle, hara, hara, the ant's go marching down the isle hara, hara...the ant's go marching two by two the little one stops to kiss the groom...""

8. You're driving around and you see an Asian dude on a Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle with a sword strapped to his back. The first thought that comes to your mind is:
I should watch out, Asian people can't drive.

9. The Battle: A Pit Bull vs. A Pit Bull's body weight in ill-tempered weasels. Who wins?:
The butler.

10. A serious Dance-Dance Revolution accident leaves you with special powers. Unfortunately the powers aren't all that super. It seems that all you can do is:
Fill out surveys.

11. What alcohol do you drink when you absolutely want the whole world to know how much you hate everyone?:
TEQUILA

12. You have sinned grossly against God and your country. Your punishment is to be eaten alive by one of God's creatures. Luckily, you get to pick what creature that is. Which do you pick?:
I think it would be funny to see a sperm whale with a harpoon gun while doing an impression of Clint Eastwood...now that would be a way to go..

13. In your most humble opinion, what do you feel is the most vile and savage swearword you can spew forth unto another person:
""Twat drizzle."" or ""Yoko Ono.""


14. You get to change the name of the state you are living in. You choose: Sanity.


15. Which animal would totally eat you if it could?:
Probably a cow.

16. Sexiest number between 1 and 10:
Three, it's all sexy and curvey...and mmmm...what an ass. 

17. You are carrying your drink back from the bar when you accidentally run into this girl, spilling your drink on her. She's being a total bitch about it but, c'mon, it was totally just an accident. Her boyfriend subsequently challenges you to fisticuffs. Name two friends you'd want on your side in a fight:
Law and Order. Chuck Norris' left and right legs.


18. If you could, what historical figure would you totally like to peg in the junk with a brick? Don't say Hitler, you uncreative fuck: The Dahli Lama...to see if that whole ""there is no pain,"" thing works.


19. What would it cost to make you willingly and knowingly contract pubic lice?:
Well, had I known they paid for it, I wouldn't have done it for free, now would I have?

20. Think of the grossest name a strip club could possibly have:
Bugs and Jugs"

"event","Last night was a lot of fun.  Give it up to Chris for throwing kick ass parties.  We <3 you!

I haven't slept for more than an hour since the party was over, however.  My wisdom teeth are fucking killing me.  I was supposed to have them out when I was a sophomore, but I'm deathly afraid of surgery, so I never did.  I know, it's my fault that they're like this.  So, I've popped 5 excederin and am hoping that the pain will soon go away.  I wish I had insurance.  I shouldn't have fucked up.  My mom said today, though ""We're getting you into the dentist, no matter what.""  So...good mommy.  She's going to help me pay for it.  She's pretty coo.  I have all four wisdom teeth--which were all supposed to be impacted; meaning they were completely sideways  imagine this is your bottom row of teeth: <__|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|__>  lol.  Which also means they're not supposed to break the skin.  I think I waited so long that they now have...my teeth have been feeling constant pressure for about two years now.  About a year ago I had something called an abscess, it's a puss-filled sac caused by an infection because of a wisdom tooth growing in correctly.  I'm pretty sure the abscess popped, but I there is still a large chunk of fatty tissue hanging next to one of my came in crooked wisdom teeth.  And you know what they say...you always play with a sore tooth.  My face isn't too horribly swollen, so that's good.  I'm icing the bitches up and looking forward to calling the dentist tomorrow.  Anyway, just felt like bitching and saying thanks to Chris.  Hollar!

"event","So, I think I forgot to mention that my dad had his one year for sobriety earlier this month.  We went to an AA picnic yesterday.  It was a lot of fun.  We played softball and ate and..well, we didn't drink obviously.  It was really nice. There was this one boy there that was 25 and he had been sober for 30 days.  He seemed really cool.  It's always hard to imagine that people around my age can be alcoholics too.  It's just really awesome that he's in it now and not later, ya know?  The people there were very nice and open-minded to everyone.  No one judged anyone and thought they were better than anyone else.  It was really nice seeing how many people can overcome such a powerful thing like alcoholism with God and friends.  I just feel bad for the people that can't find God or friends to help them.  Alcoholism is something people cannot fight themselves.  Anyway, it was fun.  I almost think dad and I didn't fight once.  Good stuff.  Just an update.  Hey, Ash...your pictures on your LJ were hot...I'd tap it...but I couldn't comment for some reason.  My computer is being a fucknut.  Oh, well.

String Cheese incident was a lot of fun, although I accidentally gouged Bruce's eyeball out and whacked her in the jaw when I was trying to catch my balance.  Sorry again, Bruce!

Anyway, I don't feel like talking really...I MySpace all the time now.  By the way...if you don't have one, GET ONE.

Writer's Rock

You know everything's going
to be all right
when a force greater than yourself
urges you to wake
to see clouds mimicing an
orange and gold-flaked sun
cascading a transluscent rock wall
strong
unclimbed
that only a 16th century English poet
could perfectly describe
the words are frail
and dim in comparison
to an Oxford vocabulary
but someone lightens the block

That moment is
when prayers get answered
when you can't remember if you had recently gone to sleep
     or were soon to wake
and the matter of obligations according
didn't seem important
when love songs are created
     inspired by a first kiss
when you can taste the colors
the warmth
and feel them wrapping themselves around your skin
like a security blanket
having the comfort of a natural high

when writer's boulder lightens for a split second
you can almost hear the breeze whisper
an assurance
a reminder something wanted you to know
     that it was still there
even if hidden behind a pebble."

<P>All I know right now is I had a pretty good weekend.&nbsp; I planned a lot of stuff, did NOTHING...and I kind of liked it.&nbsp; Friday night I was supposed to hang out with Cookie, Bruce and Giest Mike...however, I fell asleep at around 10...Kent came into my house at some point-- I can't remember if I woke up exactly when he got there--all I remember is I ended up laying on him and sleeping while he watched Rundown.&nbsp; I was asleep and woke up for some reason and I had remembered I turned my phone on silent because I was going to take a nap.&nbsp; I was thinking in my head ""I bet Megan called...I'm going to check my messages.""&nbsp; I turned on my phone it said ""2:31a.""&nbsp; I called my voicemail and Megan had called and said ""Hey, Jenna...it's almost 2:30 a.m."" and I was like ""wow....Baby Jesus must've secretly told me to check my messages.""&nbsp; Megan was really upset, so I talked to her for about 20 minutes--her manager is a complete asshole.&nbsp; He's a gay ASS BITCH.&nbsp; That's right, I said it...ASS BITCH...AND GAY.&nbsp; After that, Kent and I watched or did something...then umm...played.</P>
<P>Kent and I wake up on saturday around...11, I'm guessing--he went home for a couple of hours and mom and I went shopping.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was Dad's birthday.&nbsp; Mom took Jecka,&nbsp;Kent, Dad and I all out to Damons.&nbsp; Jecka's boyfriend was going to come, but she thought dad would be really mean to him and judge him.&nbsp; Which he probably would have because he's got visible tatoos and bad teeth.&nbsp; But, he's a lot less trashy than any of her other boyfriends, and he wasn't an asshole and he wasn't ugly when I met him...Anyway, it was really good.&nbsp; Jecka, Dad,&nbsp;and I--the meat family all got&nbsp;excellent steak.&nbsp; Mom got shrimp and Kent got a HUGE cheeseburger.&nbsp; Dinner was pretty good.&nbsp; We had just gotten finished in time for me to send Kent home and me to go to Dayton, Ohio with Kwi, Ecka and Eck!&nbsp; They bring the check back and dad says ""Let's go to a movie!""&nbsp; ""umm...k....""&nbsp; It's my dad's 50th--could I have said no?&nbsp; So, we get home to look for movie listings and to open dad's gifts *new hat, Jecka's senior picture, arrow polo shirt*&nbsp; We spend half an hour at least trying to find a movie, movies times and junk because apparently the Myers family does not know how to read a phone book...or spell, it turns out it's like 9:00, I've already told Kwi, Ecka and Eck I wasn't going to be able to make it and they had already left anyway and dad says ""Fuck it, it's too late.""&nbsp; So Kent and I go upstairs...play...and then Jecka invites us to see Be Cool at 9:50, she decides to dye her hair and take a shower and by that time, Kim and Nick have called--so we invite them--they are running late, Jecka is running WAY late.&nbsp; So, Kent and I have a little tiff.&nbsp; I thought he was being a dick--he wasn't really, he just wanted to see the movie and was a little mad that everyone was late.&nbsp; He got over it, we apologized and stuff.&nbsp; Kim and Nick picked us up and we went over to their house where Megan, Cookie and Giest Mike later showed up.&nbsp; We watched Drop Dead Fred and Lilo and Stitch.&nbsp; We talked and laughed, had a good time.&nbsp; We stopped my Matt Worland's house and Debbie was there and her two friends from Valpo.&nbsp; It was fun, Kent and I secretly put in a porn when Matt was doing gymnastics, it was called ""Secret Admirer.""&nbsp; That girl was a slut!&nbsp; But it umm...turned me on...so Kent and I went home and played, haha.&nbsp; Then we went to bed, woke up, ate cinnamon toast crunch, played again...and then he went home.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All in all, it was a very nice weekend.&nbsp; Even if nothing happened that was planned.&nbsp; I got to spend a lot of time with Kent and some friends.&nbsp; I really do wish I could've seen Eck, Ecka and Kwi.&nbsp; You guys, if you read this--I love you and miss you.&nbsp; Hollar.</P>"

""I'm about to run over that little fucking chink next door.""
-Mom
""What the hell are those two little colored boys doing there?""
-Mom
""You've seen one white trash couple you've seen them all.""
-Me
""Kind of makes ya wanna gag...""
-Mom
""Who is crazier, me...or you for letting me live and not aborting?""
-Me
""I would say that's completely my fault...I probably should've killed you at some point.""

HAHHAHHAHAHA.  What's funny is, my mom has never said Chink or Nigger a day in her life--and gets mad at me when I joke around with it.  Bitch is funny, bitch is funny.  I just can't wait to see a jew with her...

"event","<P>Miss Schiavo *SP* has now died...and I can't say anything but GOOD.&nbsp; She should have been let go 15 years ago.&nbsp; It makes me really sad to think her parents could be that selfish!&nbsp; It was almost as if she was trapped in purgetory.&nbsp; Her soul was unable to leave her body and be happy in heaven.&nbsp; I understand her parents wanted to keep her alive, but they must be psychotic.&nbsp; The machines that were keeping her alive, themselves prooved she would never have any kind of recovery...what were they expecting?&nbsp; Her to die of old age?&nbsp; WHAT THE FUCK?&nbsp; Their final plea the American public that has ever lost their baby was just pathetic...she was NOT smiling, she was NOT talking...she did that ALL the time.&nbsp; The doctors said it, and proved it.&nbsp; It shouldn't have been their decision anyway.&nbsp; It shouldn't have been congress' decision.&nbsp; It should've been her husband's decision...when you marry someone it becomes their decision and their decision only.&nbsp; It's hard to imagine that people are that stubborn.&nbsp; How do they expect the husband to move on, even themselves...or even HER for fuck's sake.&nbsp; They were just holding her back and everyone else who needed those 15 years to get over it.&nbsp; I couldn't live with the fact that I kept my son/daughter from paradise because of my selfishness.&nbsp; If my child were pudding and expressed wishes of not wanting to be kept alive by machines...I would definetly respect their spouse giving the OK...what else could you do?&nbsp; These people are psychotic!&nbsp; It just pisses me off, it shouldn't even have been in the public at all.&nbsp; This one was too personal to be public.&nbsp; It just pisses me off.&nbsp; I would be so angry with my parents for doing that--if I could, I would haunt them until their kieled...just thought I'd add some humor...eh. bye.</P>

"event","<P>Three years had gone by--no accidents.&nbsp; I had a new car, I was doing amazingly.&nbsp; 465S was heaping with drivers hopelessly trying to cut people off.&nbsp; One accident already happened and one was about to begin.&nbsp; My neighbor and I had no idea what lay ahead on this gorgeous afternoon.</P>
<P>It started well-enough turning left from Emerson onto the ramp, nearly getting sliced by an old&nbsp;Ferrari driving mid-life crisis estrogenless bitch that &nbsp;intentionally&nbsp;went faster so we were unable to merge...so when I cut her off, she proceeded to ""cut me off"" with the finger...I brake-checked the bitch.</P>
<P>We were nearing 31 when we noticed the long line of cars in the right lane, thinking it was just slowed traffic...I decided to get over later and continued on.&nbsp; We also drove by Megan who was in the slow-moving right lane.&nbsp; We then merged just before there was an accident.&nbsp; Everyone was looking at it, slowing down as they went by and peering over to see if there were any injuries, or if it was ""cool.""&nbsp; I looked over for about 2.5 seconds and glanced back to realize I was going 30 MPH, the car in front of me was probably going 15 MPH and it was five feet in front of me.&nbsp; I instinctively threw my&nbsp;arm over Mike's chest for impact reasons, slammed on the brakes and rearended a St. Francis nurse who was on her way home from work.&nbsp; Then...hit her again.&nbsp; I then looked at Mike, made she was alive turned the car back on and pulled over onto the side, 50 feet from the accident that had happened 5 minutes before.&nbsp; I got the airbag off of me, threw my seatbelt off and started choking on the airbag powder and spitting glass out of my mouth.&nbsp; I saw the windshield and it looked like Mike's head had hit it, but Mike had already gotten out, trying to get over to me without getting hit by traffic.&nbsp; I couldn't breath, I was gasping and breathing in a thick white powder when someone threw open my door and tried to help me out.&nbsp; They fanned away the powder and pulled my arm I walked over to the lady I hit, made she was okay and then went over to Mike to make sure he was okay.&nbsp; Both were fine.&nbsp; Mike's airbag had hit him so hard in the face his braces hit his lips and now they're really swollen.&nbsp; I sustained many minor injuries.</P>
<P>From where I threw my arm over Mike, there is a friction burn from his seatbelt.&nbsp; I have a huge knot and bruise on my left arm...from I don't know what.&nbsp; I can't move my arms too well.&nbsp; There is a knot from my steering wheel on my forehead.&nbsp; There is bruises on my neck from my seatbelt and necklace.&nbsp; I'm still coughing a little from the powder.&nbsp; My neck and lower back are being bitches.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So there it is.&nbsp; If I figure out how, I may post pictures of my injuries.&nbsp; Don't know...oh, well...hollar.</P>

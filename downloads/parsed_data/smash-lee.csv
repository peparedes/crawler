"event","Well I feel a bit better now that i know that he dosnt hate me...he honked at me when he drove by..as well as waved....and he did talk to me when he came online...so that must mean sumthing. I will have to learn not to fall for him again tho, becasue he is a player...and if i do i will just end up hurt..again. 
Im achy all over...everything hurts and i have little bruises all over...but i don't know what from...i got like 6 charliehorses last night in my leg when i was sleeping...and i thought i was dying...it still hurts in the same spot now...even when im just walking...so i dono...
Im in a whiny mood...like now im gonna whine about how luke told me he would call me and he hasn't...like 4 days in a row he has said he would and hasn't..typical male....never reliable..BAH
okay im gonna quit this cuz this chair is uncomfy and hurting my back....-there i go again whining about everything...lol

"event","So its been like way over a month since ive wrote in here.. i guess i should start more often seeing as now im gonna have to type for hours to fill in everything interesting that i would have told u if i saw u every day like i used to...
That entry you wrote made me cry...I miss you to... i miss what we had..i miss not having someone to rant to...and laugh with..and embarass all the time...i knew it made u mad..but it was nice to know that u would get over it in 5 minutes, and wait to see what i would do next...
So there was that guy that i liked so much it could have almost been called love....we hung out all the time..and talked contsantly...he finally realized that he dosnt like me i guess...cuz now i hardly ever see him...but when i do he likes to treat me like his gf..with all the hugs and kisses and such...it makes me float...but then he goes to see his old girlfriend...I want to tell him that she really dosnt want him..the same way she hasnt for the last year...but i know deep down he knos it and it will just hurt him to hear it from me...he went to see her..and as soon as he left..she started talking bad about him...he didnt know..so he went to see her again....me and him got in a fight tonight...when i told him i wasnt kissing him becasue i knew he had went to see her and that there were other girls.. i told him i was sick of his shit..and i walked away...leaving him parked there on the road in his van not knowing what to say...it hurts to know that my best friend is mad at me now...but i feel better that i told him how i felt, and that i am no longer going to be his little rag-doll...whom which he calls when he is horny. I love him to death and would never say a bad thing about him in my life...except that he is unreliable...cuz thats his only real fault. He is used to being able to do what he wants when he wants with who he wants...so i cannot just go into his life and expect him to change how he is...he has had a player image for so long i dono if he will ever be able to change...but i like him for who he is inside...so ill deal with it
anyhoo...thats a long rant about him...
schools fun..im in co-op..im gettin honours...feels good to actually think im smart...
im goin to wonderland in a few weeks...
and ya....more later when im in another typing mood...

"event","Today was great..i had a meeting and new training at work, and it was actually kind of fun, im exahusted tho...long day at work and i just got home from a long walk, but i like the exercise.. i wanna get skinnier so i can fit in my prom dress, even tho i have no date, and will probably end up just not going...

So i was completely amazed last night, i was laying in bed, thinking about someone, and how he told me he would call me...and the phone rings, and it was him, i was so happy, he makes me smile so much and always knows how to make me laugh,its not everyday you can talk to someone for over 4 hours on the phone and never run out of things to say...i miss you!...come home soon!...

I Got my apprenticeship book today, so now i can start getting it filled out, its neat how i can be in highschool, filling out a apprenticeship book for college, plus take 2 courses at the same time when i go to college...its really good actually...alot of money tho...

Well i have things to do...maybe more later!

"event","I Have such a headache...maybe it was from the menengitis needle i had to get at school today, or maybe it was from listening to a teacher ramble on all day, or the stupid kids in my class who think that they need to yell to be heard...who knoes...but it hurts real bad..
Today was the first time i have been at school in like 3 weeks..and i wont be back now til april 4, gee what a big loss eh...i miss my friends tho, i love being able to see them as much as i can...good times we have had...but oh well..

"event","This is new to me, and may take awhile to get used to, the fact that everyone can just come and read my thoughts and feelings, maybe that is good tho, because then i can tell You how i feel without having to be so verbal as i am all the time.
This is going to be fun, im excited to be able to write non-stop about anything i want, or anyone i want, like maybe the one person who has been on my mind constantly. I want to hate you, but can't bring myself to, after what you have done to me, i find it hard to even look into your eyes, but when i do i melt, and go weak inside, until i remember what you did, and how you made me feel...."

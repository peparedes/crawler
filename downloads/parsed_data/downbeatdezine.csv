I know you switched those salads on purpose today so that you could wink at me while you gave me my real one at the other end of the salad/pasta thing, and yes, I do see something that I like."

There is no way that I can function with that thing slapped to my arm.  It made me dizzy and nauseous and now my chest hurts a little.  But it's slowly going away."

"event","So my vet called me last night to inform me that Bacon has gingivitis.  I have to brush his teeth on a regular basis with chicken-flavoured toothpaste.  Poor little dude.  His gums are all inflamed.  And there is nothing that makes you feel more guilty than being called to say that you've been both feeding him kitten food for too long, and that it could be genetic but eventually, if you don't brush his teeth every day, he'll need his teeth out.  Gargh."

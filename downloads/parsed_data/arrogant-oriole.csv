So I'm probably gonna start posting here again.&nbsp;Maybe join some groups and post stuff there.
I'm kinda getting tired of deviantArt.
I wouldn't LEAVE dA, no. I have too many friends there to drop it.
But some of the changes are kinda getting to me.

Gonna try for a post a week, even if nobody's watching. XD

"event","<p>So, Tuesday night (Opening Night @ Camden Yards) me and my dad went to the game. I took the Light Rail for the first time that I can remember. (My VERY first game was when I was 6 and I don't remember much. I DO still have the magazine from that game, though.)<br /><br />Anyway, we got there early for batting practice. Not too early, as the O's were already done and the Tigers were practicing. The COOLEST thing is... wait for it... I caught NOT ONE, BUT <font color=""#ff6600""><u>TWO</u><font color=""#000000""> batting practice balls! I kept the first and gave the second to a VERY cute little boy standing next to me. Well... the first one Fernando Rodney threw in my general direction. But the second one WAS hit directly to me. (I also realize that the ball would've hit me in the face if I didn't have my glove up. The key to catching batting practice balls: keep the hands in front of the face.) And someone congratulated me on catching two balls in one batting practice. That was pretty cool.<br /><br />That was awesome. However, we (""we"" being the O's) lost 3-1. But we've sorta rebounded since then. Took two from the Royals. Nick Markakis hit&nbsp;his first&nbsp;GRAND SLAM. That was awesome. We're 5-6 now</font></font>. Still in 4th, but only half a game behind the Yankees for 3rd!<br /><br />-Arrogant Oriole</p>"

Even though he was a Yankee, I don't REALLY want anyone to die ever. It's even sadder when you consider that the thing he loved was the thing that took him away from us.

I remember that one of the games the Orioles won (final: 9-4) when we went was on September 8. It was Lidle against Bedard. I went with my then-new friend Chelsea, a Yankee fan. I still have the scorecard, magazine, and ticket from that game. Now that Lidle is gone, I put it on my bulletin board. I think I'll put ""R.I.P. Cory Lidle 1972-2006"" on it.

I think that ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" is like a theme song for any sadness that happens in my lifetime. For me. On sad annivversaries, days of death, whenever it rains, and just when I'm feeling down, I play it.

I hope his family feels better after this tragedy.

Being 8 years old, I didn't really realize the importance of the day. As time went by, I realized that the day was a very important day and that almost 3000 people had died because of the cruel decision of one group. The day also changed me in a way. I don't really feel safe getting on a plane anymore, and I've grown a little more mature.

Anyway, Erik Bedard pitched well. 11 hits given up, but all but one were singles. He kept us in the game, so hats off to you, Bedard.

Drama in the 9th: Tied 2-2. 1 out. Corey Patterson stole second. Ramon Hernandez with a 3-2 count. CAN HE DELIVER A GAME WINNING HIT?!?! YES, BUT DOES HE?!?!?!?!?!?!

Shot up the middle. Patterson scores easily. Orioles win 3-2. (Now me and my dad are 1-4 on the year.)

I even got a souveneir. A cup. Useful.

Thoughts:
1. After we won, I high-fived a whole bunch of people I didn't know. Yeah. Dramatic wins will do that to you.
2. I like ""Psych."" Anyone else like ""Psych?"" Shawn Spencer is CUTE!

1. Miguel Tejada trade rumors have been flaring up again. I doubt he's going anywhere.
2. FINALLY got the Arrogant Worms DVD today!!!! ""We Are The Beaver"" made me cry because the song made it suck to not be Canadian.
3. Listened to ""American Idiot"" (the album) for the first time last week.
4. Last night, I had a dream that Trevor Strong tried to kill me with an ice axe. I'm probably going to be skeptical around him.
5. I also FINALLY inhaled helium. After a long time. I got an awesome, yet really weird head rush. It's painless (unless you bump into stuff), but I kept feeling like I was going to float out of my body and die.
6. Why do I suddenly want to put cheesse on everything?
7. Does anyone know how to submit fanstuff to homestarrunner.com?

No poem this time, as my brain is too focused on the Orioles (39-49) game right now.

Thoughts
1. Bonus Stage isn't ending at all! (Or is it...?)
2. First Orioles exhibition game is next (or should I say this) week. You know I'm gonna listen to it. Or watch it. Or maybe you don't know...
3. I plan to post my semi-decent drawings on my LJ. I'll get better at it.
4. I'm a semi-finalist in a national poetry contest. Cool!
5. I had a dream where ALMOST EVERYONE around me was pregnant. That was weird. I was at an Arrogant Worms event... and THEY were pregnant too... in fact, Trevor went into labor during their performance... creepy... sorry I forced that on you.
6. Due to Thought #5, I am now writing a song about pregnancy. It's to the tune of ""The Last Saskatchewan Pirate,"" so you'll never hear it. But I might post the lyrics when I'm done.

And now, Arrogant Oriole's Poetry Corner (Another reference...)

Title: Anticipation

My teacher...
  Is droning on...
    As the clock is stuck
      At 2:57 pm...
        Just 3 more minutes...
          And I'll be free (for a week)...
            The minute hand...
              Trudges to 2:58 pm...
                I can tell...
                  That my teacher...
                    Doesn't want to be here, either...
                      2:59 pm...
                        60 lousy seconds...
                          Between me...
                            And freedom...
                              2:59:37 pm...
                                We all count the seconds...
                                  As the second hand...
                                    Teases us...
                                      2:59:57...
                                        3...
                                          2...
                                            1...
""Have a good winter break class!!""
My teacher says
as we rush out the door
I swear
he hated waiting more than we did..."

"event","Hello. How long have you been waiting for me to update? If people honestly read this...

I hope you had a nice New Year. Chris Patterson's birthday was on New Year's. If you didn't, wish him a happy belated. Mike's b-day is next. On March 19. Trevor's isn't until mid-summer (July 31). You've got time.

Thoughts:

1. I learned today that the Orioles traded Jorge Julio and John Maine to the Mets for Kris Benson. (I'm a little glad to see Julio go.)

2. The Arrogant Worms' new album is called ""Beige."" The first 100 people to preorder will get their copy signed. I'm sure that more than 100 people have preordered by now. I want to hear ""Canadaman.""

3. I'm sure that ""Bonus Stage"" will be updated... eventually...

4. Edgar Allan Poe's birthday passed by recently. Haps belated, Mr. Poe.


Poem
Driving down the highway
Of Allegheny County
I saw a strange man
with orange eyes like fire
He wore a green art smock
and wobbled and swayed
I thought he was drunk
and maybe he was
But I saw him again
and now I know

If anyone has an idea about how this should continue, make a note!"

Poem for people who actually read this:

I look at you
You look at me
I smile at you
You stare at me

I say ""This is the end""
You scream ""No""
I raise my arm
You scream ""No"" again
I say goodbye
You scream ""No"" once more
I pull the trigger
You scream
I fall over
still smiling
You catch me
in your arms
I smile at you
dead
You cry over me

Peace out, people.

"event","I knew I shouldn't have drunk the milk on Thrusday. I got really sick that day and continuously felt like vomiting through Friday. I finally heaved on Friday night in the family van. I felt a lot better this morning, though I was angry when my mom denied me some Dr. Pepper.

Some Thoughts:
1. It is reported that Miguel Tejada is backing away from his thoughts on being traded to another team. (Whew!)

2. There's this relly cool animation about the song ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" by the Beatles. You can watch it <a href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/239712/"">here</a> if you wish. If you don't like REALLY cute characters being EXTREMELY violent, then don't watch.

3. My dad says that he won't buy any Arrogant Worms merchandise until my report card becomes better. (No DVD for me...)

4. Richard Pryor was funny. REAL funny. I miss him some.

5. No one wants to be my friend...


Poem time:

This is the story of Kevin Moon
Whose favorite time of day was noon
Unaware that his life would end soon
Oh, fate was cruel to Kevin Moon

Kevin Moon liked pinapple chunks
His favorite music type was funk
He enjoyed the sensation of being drunk
And Kevin enjoyed talking to chipmunks

One night as drunk Kevin came out of the bar
He went into the street and didn't go far
He saw some lights like fireflies in a jar
Then, sadly, poor Kevin was hit by a car

So here ends the story of Kevin Moon
Who died at midnight, the opposite of noon
The poor man's life had ended too soon
Oh, fate was cruel to Kevin Moon!

"event","Today... pretty much sucked. My baby cousin was pretty much tortured today by the adults. They made him sit in a chair. HE NEEDS TO MOVE, OR HE WILL BE MISERABLE!! I cried with him. They were torturing me as well as him! The Ravens lost. Again. Kyle Boller made a BIG mistake that may have cost them the game.

Thoughts:
I've also noticed that the Goth Girl mood indicator also dies when I feel pessimistic.
The Orioles signed Ramon Hernandez. Cool.
I wonder if the Arrogant Worms will EVER come here. To Maryland. I wish they would. It would be cool.
Full moon on Thursday, for whoever needs that info.

Poem for you people.

You lack the knowledge
You lack the strength
You lack the physique
You lack the intuition
But you've got the heart
The determination
And the bravery
And that's why I'm letting you go

Forever yours, Arrogant Oriole"

Amount of Money: None that I can use
Days until Christmas: 15

Stuff I'm Thinking About:
Miguel Tejada seems to want a trade. DON'T GO!!! PLEASE!!!!
Two days ago was the 25th anniversary of John Lennon's murder. I felt sad then.
I've noticed that my mood indicator (that cute little goth girl) dies when I feel hungry.

And now, a poem for you all. I made it up just now.

The light breeze blows in from the window
And whisks me away from the world
It carries me beyond the street
Beyond the neighborhood
Beyond the city
The state
The country
Beyond the world
It carries me out to sea
Where I look down
I float but never fall
I dream but never sleep
I wonder but never think...

Signing off, Arrogant Oriole"

procrastination... I saw Eva Amurri (jew chick from Saved!) on Sat when I went to see The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, on Sat night. She dyed her hair white, or maybe it was a wig...it was nice.

I rented Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and didnt watch it. I'm planning on renting The Addams Family now and not watching it just to keep the momentum going."

"event","So I just finished watching this indie flick called elephant, which chronicled one day in the lives of 10 random high school kids, and this day also happened to be the day 2 kids (one who liked very similar to chris hayashida) decided to go on a killing spree in school. yeaaa..it was really good tho. 

Anyway this weekend was random...friday was a ridiculous time with adam, justin, lauren and danington of course. yeahh so dana and i had a very nice little bonding experience; getting really drunk and blabbering on for like an hour and half..then flash forward,to everyone else arriving and all hell breaking loose when the cops stop by. 

 i realized how much i hate recaping. I quit.


 cant wait for lovi to come down for my chemical romance, cant wait for bowie, cant wait to fucking do something....boreddddddddddddddddddddd"

"event","Jesus Christ Mr Hat.  Ehh, so the rain had me sleeping from 3:45-7:15...which was pretty much my entire day minus my morning classes...rather depressing, but at least I have the energy to party it up for my boy Richies B-day tonight! Woohoo!!....... oh wait. thats not happening, because he is too busy in Manhattan meeting Diego with...with... BILL. BILL. The same Bill who came to TCNJ and almost took a cab out of there at 3am because he was so fucking annoying 30 people wanted to stab him to death. The same Bill who drank with high schoolers in my basement until 4am on Easter Sunday and had to get up by 8. The same Bill who gets stoned and trys explaining things that NOBODY gives a shit about for 3 hours and completely kills your high. THAT BILL. ..Richie, Richie, Richie...way to ruin this already crappy day. Oh well, other plans have been which also include getting tanked so its all good...just a little disappointing..tisk tisk.

Anywho...so yeah, yesterday I came back to Fordham and got into my room to find my roomie Conner beside himself because someone stole like..about $1300 worth of shit from his desk (printer, digi camera, camcorder, head phones, ps2)...it goes on. Anddd guess who was the last person to leave and guess who now feels uncomfortable in his own room...me. Today is actually a million times better, but i can tell hes upset and he does have a right to be..it just sucks

Friday!!!! Friday is the one glimmering ray of light in this rainy dreary week. SKATE AND SURF BABY!!!! WOOO! I still need to figure out how to get home, but whatever, if I have to miss all my classes that is what is gonna happen. Awesome..I'm so excited, and hopefully I'll get to see Kill Bill Vol. 2 with my BFFs! Yippee! ...speaking of the Bffs, I really had a great time this weekend, even though we only shared Hurricane Friday together, which was so haphazard and ridiculous that we couldnt quite 'chill' but oh so eventful and gloriously delicious. lol. It was awesome and I had a great time and left with a new plethora of inside jokes. Anyway, I'm looking foward to this weekend hardcore is all my saying.

"event","Wow. Two days and I have already hit so many highs and lows. ..I woke up at 4pm today, what the fuck is wrong with me.  I woke up to an empty house, a message-less cell phone, and short list of people to call to see. After none of those people on the list picked up I began to sink into deep despondency. ..'what is going here', 'who and where are my friends', 'what the fuck am I going to do all this week'...so on and so forth. FINALLY Lauren picks up and comes over with Andrew, 1 min before they get here I get in touch with Jess who is now heading over, and 3 min after L Bam and Andrew get here my brother walks in with 50 other kids...yay, despondency for the day is over. Life has purpose again...for the time being.

This weekend was a different matter tho. Friday Lauren and I had a great low-key time at FU..most everyone was gone for Spring Break, but she got to meet some key people..aka Julissa, Amy, Alice, BeBe, Sofia...my loves. Sat, is where the madness begins. We drop lauren back home and I spend the afternoon with Dave. In the midst of chillin I get a marvelous phone call from a long lost love...MARGOOOOO!..for those of you who 'know' Margo..you really dont know a fucking thing about her, and for those of you who dont..she was the perfect person to talk to at that moment. She was nostalgia case #1, but with her it was different. It was happy nostalgia...not nostalgia that depresses you to the point of absolute despondency, like pretty much everything else. She asked me to marry her when I was ready to 'settle down, have sex with me, have beautiful kids, have me make dinner for you, and be really rich.' ..I said yes naturally.  The second fantastic encounter was with Theo. Picked my dawg up and brought him over and liquored him up. He was really funny until Laurens house where he went overboard..still love him tho. Tim is the man, he is a great friend and we share a great connection. Chillin with him made me really thankful that we still maintain our friendship despite the school difference and the other town difference. It was super-duper. 

Of course seeing Carly and Jessica and meeting Brian from TCNJ was fantastic, but the really icing on the cake came with my discussion with Kevin. Yes, Kevin. We both finally sat down and spoke to each other, even though it wasnt exactly..shall I say a mutual decision to speak. But I'm really glad we did. I mean, the air isnt exactly entirely cleared but its better and I'm optimistic that thing may eventually become amiable. I'm actually hoping to go to TCNJ tomorrow, which will be a good time as long as i can pull it off. (evening of nostalgia x200)

Sunday I had to drop Tim off..and on the way he found an old Ataris CD in my car. Not just any CD, but one of my fav. punk CDs I owned. Its been lost for ..oh I dont know..a year, and it was the most beautiful Ataris CD before they fucking SOLD OUT!!!! The CD reminded me soooo much of Dana and the time right when we became friends, and hit me really hard, because it seemed like so much of what the tracks were singing about directly applied to whats going on here with everyone. It was a nostalgia heart attack. and still is. Its like I want to listen to the CD sooo much because I love every song, but yet its kinda painful because it strongly reminds of things soo distance from todays reality. Maybe I'm being over dramatic and maybe I was just really fucked when I was listening to it last night with Lauren, but it was painful, and not having Dana here made it rough..but maybe better because I wasnt able to reminece about the Atari concert (our first together/ our first time chillin/ CBGB T shirt maddness!) lol. Good times. 

AHhhhhhhhh...oh yeah and last night I saw Wrestlemania XX with John Coyle!!! LOL. Wow...yeah, I seriously havnt watched WWF (I refuse to call it WWE) in like 4 years and I havnt chilled with Coyle in just as many..j/k john. I was fantastic! THE UNDERTAKER made his glorious return WITH PAUL BEARER ooohhhh yesssss!! lol, it was a happy does of nostalgia and I'm so glad I watched it with John. Good Times.

SOOOOO..I guess theres nothing else to do except wait and see what this fucking week brings, and hope its more good times than bad. ciaoo."

"event","Well..I cant fucking sleep at all so I decided to hit this mother up. Soo much random shit going on..where to begin. Weekend seems like a good starting point. Friday was the biggest blowout one human can ever endure. It was a total mess. I was so fucked up from a duel substance combo that I have about 30 seconds of memory from Upper Deck and everything else..but thank god my faithful friends were there to fill me in. Apparently, things started to deteriorate when I began telling this kid whom I thought was a pretentious dumbass in my philosophy class that I was going to slash his face new jersey style. The kid was kinda freaked out and left, so the next event was the huge fight that my roomate and I engaged in. I still have no voice and this is ...oh um...FOUR days fucking later. What the fight was about we both dont even remember but the result was us leaving Upper Deck (after I pissed under a table full of girls..lol thanks jess!, screaming at each other in the middle of the Bronx, Eric leaving me alove...and coming back later to find me hysterically shouting that I was almost killed. what happened I dont know..but the next morning I woke up to a chunck missing from my knuckle on my right hand..and zero cash in my wallet...oh and a ridic hangover. Anyway, so Eric comes back to save his asshole roomate with our stalker Mike who was at Upper Deck also, and dealing with my cries of 'I was almost killed' and we return to campus..where I proceeded to go on a rampage in my room ""shouting at the top of my lungs about world issues"" as Conner put it. Conner was in the room and was totally unprepared for the havoc Eric and I dished out. I torn our wall sized Union Jax off the window, threw my fan across the room and continued screaming and shouting untill I somehow passedout. Eric and I basically had a screaming match until we blacked out.  Conner told me Sat morning that he was so scared and didnt know what to do that he called his girlfriend like 10 times, called our other roomate kevin to come back, and TMed 6 people. LOL. I'm sorry, its funny but its not. 

Next morning I wondered if I still had my best friend here/ next years roomate, and of course I did!..I was worried tho, I woke before EJ and my babies told me about the carnage..wasnt pretty. But Eric couldnt remember what the fight was even about, and we agreed we were both too fucked up to be taken seriously. ..my hand still fucking kills, new scar tho, yay!

The next day we go on a little bonding trip with our girls to Century 21 in front of ground zero, do some shopping therrr and go to china town to pick up fighting fish. Heres the great part.. remember 'Our stalker Mike' from paragraph one? Well hes back, and this time hes randomly on the streets of CHINA FUCKING TOWN...HOW FUCKING RANDOM?! We may have fucking won the lottery because the odds of that..just arent possible to calculate! hence, STALKER. funny thing was that that morning we were making fun of him for like 45min straight and his stalkerness...goes to show you. 

Thank night Eric and I tell ourselves we need to take it easy and take out Resivoure Dogs from the library, until some of his friends from home show up soooo of course we have to show em a good time. So the jolly tinkers we went. Oh man..  I almost killed some gay kid that looked like he suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome/ down syndrome, and I was sitting next to this kid named Dan...or should I say ' Danger Dan ' who I find out drove from upstate NY just to drink at Tinker, he goes to UCONN, but DRIVES DOWN TO TINKERS EVERY WEEKEND BECAUSE ITS 'MAD COOL'...are you kidding?? He doesnt even know anyone at FU! Then , him and his friend drive like 4 hours back home, drunk off their asses?!...wonder why they call him danger dan? Oh well let me use his exact words. ""Yo, man..its like I do crazy shit..I just dont give a shit man. One time someone payed me 5 bucks to let them put staples all over my body..like real staples. You know how much that hurts? Then another time I snorted an entire pixie stick up my nose..it felt like a fucking lighter up my brain!! My phiolosophy is like, the body heals, so whatever"" .....  ......  ..... danger dan folks.. wtf..freaks are just drawn to me no matter where I am.  Anyway, erics friends roomate who had never been to a bar before, went over his limit and needed to be helped, so he threw up all night long in out bathroom.  Overall awesome night, alot of great laughs, and nobody killed anyone.   

Ehh..long weekend recap..do I feel tired yet tho?  not really..but I should try to sleep I suppose... OOO WHOS SEEING BOWIE!!!!!! MEEEEEEE!!!!!!! and the holmdel gang...but KICK ASSSS!!!!!! thanks dana for the tix.. jesus christ, this is b-day week! my girl Jess (FU), My dad, dana! Yay! and Dana is coming to NYC friday for her bday and we are gonna party like rockstars! Sze is also coming down fer the event, so it should be a kick ass time!!

So, tomorrow is the last day of my break...and oh my lord what an eventful break it has been...moreso than even most of my closest confidants even know...yesss i have my secrets too. muhahaaha.

well, DSDL was in for an uber turbulent time, but all is well that ends well...and unfortunatly we wont know if all is well for a while. As always, every cloud has its silver lining, and I must say that I love em all more than ever, which is something I didnt think was possible. Its just been too crazy...like as eventless the days seem to be there were probably just as many if not more days of extreme maddness and of course fucking turmoil. Its funny because every single one of my friends have had an unexpected shift or personal revelation in terms of analyizing their relationships with 'other people'...I really just hope that we can have the fortitude to steer a new course in our lives and try to break away from the routine that dulls and sufficates us all at points in time. this semester is going to be a new chance for EVERYTHING and i really cant wait...dont let this new oppertunity go to waste, goin out to everyone..i just hope I can follow my own advice. its def. going to be sad to part with smitty and dana but i know my kids will be A ok...i just hope ill be. =)

"event","Wow... I just got out of the shower and my head is like still spinning from this weekend..lol...it was ridiculous. All I'm going to do is recap for my own sanity, because so much has happened I need to imortalize it in LJ.

Friday- Once I was done with classes I was basically just bullshitting around FU until 7:45 where I went with Jess, Kathryn and Alice to learn how to make sushi for free! Sounds delicious right? wrong. It was alot of fun to actually make it and see how its all done, which is actually pretty easy and very fun, but they should have had more supplies for everyone because like 20 people were sharing like one knife and we running out rice and shit like that..so we ended up Puglseys do be delivered to the room while we were still making sushi. So after we ordered, we walk over to the deli to get drinks, and right next to the deli is rods. coffee house, where a fucking punk show was going on! It was awesome, I walked in with alice and watched a band wrapup there last set, and it totally reminded me of birch, which made me very sad and realzied how much ive missed 'the scene'. So, i decided right there that I'm going to see coheed on monday with dana, which is going to be AWESOME!!!...anyway, i bought a demo cd of a band called The Sleeping and Alice and i jetted out to go to the room to eat and pre-game! Lol..thats where the trouble started. I basically drank like one whole teacup full of vodka and then like another half, and the 3 girls were doing there own damage. I decided to call my boy Nick to see what he was up too, and being the awesome person that he is, he invited me to come smoke with him in his room. So after an awesome smoking session we meet up with the girls on their way to some off campus party. Well WHOA...we were majorly fucked,and walked through the Bronx with 3 drunk girls on our way to God knows where..it was quite the adventure, and once we got there it was out of hand. a tiny bit awkward at first, but we got to know everyone there and became totally jealous of their own house with their own backyard garden type thing..and their own keg. The highlight of the evening was Kathryn, Jess and Alice doing keg stands and just everyones behavior in general...it was crazy, and the girls ended up getting soo fucked from the stands. Nick and I smoked anothter bowl in the middle of the hallway of the house, with the houses like owner and Alice and Jess too...we ended leaving and headed to Tinkers, but there was only one little problem, which was how fucked up Kathryn was. She was trashed...trashed trashed trashed! lol. She refused to leave Tinks so we stayed and Alice basically propped her up and walked her around the packed bar. Everyone must have thought we were crazy for letting KAthryn stay, so we ended up leaving and thank god we did ( I told her the guys hitting on her had their penis' out and that a rat crawled over the floor), because that girl got so sick once we left the bar, i can still hear it! ewww...lol. On the walk back, we were nearly pissing our pants because Kathryn was so damn funny. She fell like face down in the middle of the road and the aweful friends we are, we stood there unable to move because we were laughing so hard. Getting back into the room, was an event i dont want to go into details of, but it was equally ridiculous, and everyone thought Jess and I were monsters because kat was seriously beyond trashed and we just couldnt stop laughing at everything she said and did. Kathryn was the highlight of the frickin nite. ...I passedout at sometime after 4 and woke up at 2 Sat aternoon...

Sat- Sat was quite the adventure. I woke up at 2 and took the 3 o clock ram van in order to meet up with Dana! Dana randomly decided to head in to the city and holy shit am I glad she did. I went shopping on 5th with Jess and Molly until Dana met up with us and we to eat at Au bon pon? or someshit like that. It was sweet..we went to H&M on 34th and then said good bye to Jess and Molly and headed over to Chelsa where Ryan was having a small party for Krystal. We basically walked 45 blocks (60th to 16th) picking up gifts for krystal along the way, and once we got there we were informed that Ryan and Krystal were shopping on H&M on 34th soo we decided to go to Urban Outfitters and then the Village. Dana did some serious shopping and Urbn and once we got into the village we walked down christopher street and ran into a small buddhist store which was awesome. The entire atmosphere was just so frickin nice and it was so enjoyable to walk around and shop or just talk, which is what I had been dying to do all week! We finally started heading up Bleecker when Krystal calls and we head back to 16th but make one stop, to inquire how much this beautiful glass bong was that was in the window of a head shop. It was $850, and as we were about to leave the guy asks us 'if we want to freeze our brains' and basically sold us nitrus and a cracker. lol. we were so fucking happy! We got to Ryans house, and all hell breaks loose. Krystal looked very stunning with a new haircut and she and her friends were so welcoming and funny it took no time to feel right at home. We did some drinking and once everyone was rather tipsy dana and I broke out the nitrus where like everyone then proceeded to us it and get fucked up! LOL..it was wild! Dana, Me, Ryan, Krystal, Anthony, and Ryans hot friend were like rolling around in hysterics. They are all worthy of their own small TV shows. Andddd to make matters better, Ryan treated Dana and myself to some unexpected Diego which the others obviously didnt know about. It was awesome...we were all so fucked up...and then thats were they decided to take us to their neighborhood gay club. WHOA. CRAZYYYYYYYYYY...Krystal was attacked by some lesbian and as she put it ""I tastefully removed my breast from her hand"" LOLLL. Dana got caressed by some old dude and later on joined in a little sandwich with gay black guy and his buddy. It was fucking crazy. Needless to say to matter what the conditions are, Steve is never the interest of anyone, and in this case I was rather thankful. I was very surpirsingly safe the entire night. We basically danced the whole time until somewhere after 3, where we left and headed back to Ryans appartment which was like a block away. It was madness...pure and beautiful maddness. We stayed up and talked till like 5, but i couldnt sleep very well..and who knows when it was i passedout. Dana left to catch a 10 o clock train and i slept till 3 with krystal and ryan, and then headed back to FU. Here I am now, with a shit load of work to do, so im gonna try and hit it up now. Phew..that was pretty much everything..cant wait till coheed tomorrow! Peace chillins."

"event","Wow. Its Sunday and I'm back...wait...its now Monday. I love eventful weekends..I just wish I was able to write about everything in detail without wanting to hammer a nail through my eye. 

Halloween was awesome. The City is amazing..everything is nuts...well nuttier than usual. My costume as Bowie was good..the make-up was kickass...I had several comments from strangers on it, not to mention some random kisses (oo yea)lol.. Dana and I had the craziest and most exhausting nite...still recovering.

Seeing Alex was awesome..I love her! Its so great to see that she is  still the same awesome person..and her friends were kickass too..crazy girls, cant wait to party with them. Here are the spotted Holmdelians for the weekend: Danielle, Alex, Flora Pei, Neil Bojani, Normon So, Monica Renzo, Mike Espozito, Chris Cicerlli. Random and crazy indeeddd.

Sat was awesome again. When is it not awesome to see BFFs? Got totally fucked up with everyone, Andrew stayed over and the fucked up ness never ended. 3 of our plants died tho. That was uber fucked up and sad. but they have the best chance of survival where they are right now, so theres nothing that can be done.

Today I just procrastinated all day still leaving me with a shitload of work to do. But Id rather write in Livejournal than do it. The train ride to Penn was crazy..I was still so fucked up and that when I ran into Monica and Mike..I made n ass of myself. @ the subway I then proceeded to get on the E train and then had to get off at 53rd and take a taxi to Lincoln Center..it was aweful. ..but i did get to see a tall black transvestite/drag queen. yeay for me. annoying people on the Ram Van as usual. I sat next to some chick that was totally Trinity from the matrix..I think she wanted to kill everyone on the van too. We should have done it together.

 So yea. I love LJ. Im soo glad i've revived it for myself...and its sooo nice to see everyone elses entries..just fun funington. Oo yea im gonna revive the -ington also lol.  The only thing left to revive is my own body after my teachers kill me tomorrow. Awesome weekend behind me, awesome weekend to look foward too, I just hope this week goes as fast as last one did. Time to motor.."

"event","At one point in time I was very happy. Yesterday was a rather nice day, I spent the entire evening with Danielle and bullshitted around and looked foward to seeing her on friday along with many other good friends. The night before was awesome. I was completely trashed and smoked some very fine bud. The combination of those things made me very happy.

Theres alot of shit on my mind right now that has totally destroyed the beauty of my few moments of happiness here. I was looking foward to an awesome Halloween and weekend, but as usual things dont turn out the way you hope them too. This weekend is beyond frustrating. Ive actually just about had it. I realize that at times I can be selfish and self focused, but this is one incident where I know its not me. I dont have anything more to say...actually I have alot more to say, but some things are better off unsaid.

I actually couldnt sleep last night. It was combination of thoughts of school and people..all which were frustrating. I feel like I have to meditate to sort out alot of my emotions because if I dont I think I'll just erupt. ...but who has time to meditate...
  
I dont know...tomorrow will be awesome and I know I should just focus on that; but I cant."

"event","Sooo yea. My wish finally came true! I slept through my day! Well...for the most part. I slept like all day yesterday besides my classes, till like 4. Then I fell alseep like around like 8-830 and woke up this morning! Just because there is never any satisfying me, I was little upset that not one person even called between those very long hours to chill or to see whats up...but whatever.  Rich actually stopped by and that was the extent of my friends.

Sooo today is Tuesday...I'm in my Info Systems class and I'm just chillin. I'm gonna be chillin till THURS cause I got no class. ...side note: I keep thinking about my Terrarium!      So yea..I'm looking foward to Halloween! I dont have a costume, but I dont think it matters anyway..I'm a little upset at myself for not having one..but on the other hand I really didnt have any motivation to think of one, cause DSDL has been sitting on its asses in terms of Halloween. So i dont know whats going on. I'm going to call Danielle and Krystal and Bridget to see what the deal is..and hopeful everyone else can meet up here too.

Dont know what I'm gonna do today..midterm grades come out this week and today is the last day to hand in any assignments for the grade..soo..of course I still have some shit to do

LIZZY comes to NYC tomorrow!!! I'm thinking I'm gonna try to meet up with her and her friends..should be kinda sweet. We'll see how everything goes but I'm very excited

So yea...just breezin through my days..peace thugs"

"event","Sooo today I did nothing. Literally nothing besides walk to class, sit through class then sleep. On top of all of it, I skipped one of my classes, which left me with only 2. PATHETIC...but you know what? It feels soo damn good. Nothing to do, nothing to do.

Fun weekend tho. It was chill, got really fucked up, did a whole lot of nothing tho except chill and get fucked up. It was what I needed.

Halloween is kinda an iffy weekend. I dont kno what everyone wants to do..but I've decided I'm going to stay here. Halloween in NYC baby, Holmdel doesnt compare. Going to the parade, maybe seein Tessa! Woo woo! Maybe part of DSDL will come over, I'm hopeful.

I have a huge paper to write for the class I skipped today. I need a topic pertaining to like government or social order or something like that. I suck at thinking of one. It killing me internally.

Other shits got me down...maybe its the rain.

ehhhhhhhhh,I wish i could sleep for days."

So I got to see Smith for a few hours on Sunday, and had an excellent time con Laurita on Sat nite. GO see Texas Chainsaw Masacre stoned! Run out and see the next show right now!! ..What and experience.

Overall my weekend was good. I hit the bars on Friday and had a really awesome time with everyone from school...but then Sat started to go downhill so I motored and saw Lauly and after the flick got fucked up with L&D till like..3am? 2am? When was it?! lol.

I say my boy on Sunday. Great to have him back....felt like it was forever.... just sucked to have to go back to class. The weekend was a big tease. BIG MEAN EVIL TEASE. ...yay...i got to go to being with the BFFs to dealing with roomate shit among other ridiculous problems. grrrrrr..

So Lauren is still home for her fall break and so is the rest of the gang...so it sucks to be out here on my lonesome. lol. ....getting any pitty points? Didnt think so...but that how it is. Only a few more days anyway...hopefully no class on Friday..im praying that mine is canceled also, for the inaugeration of our new school president. we shall see i guess.

Anyway I'm going to think of happy thoughts, and the best one that comes to mind is said best in the words of God: 

Its alright the band is altogether!

well thats really a little modified Bowie, but whats the diff?"

So back at FU and I'm wasting my life away as usual. This weekend was soooo much fun, too bad my BFF was MIA. He better get his ass back here soon..even tho i know hes got to be lovin it..which is what really matters. 

So today basically consisted of sleeping tell 2:30 then eating and going to the Botanical Gardens w/ Kina to pick up some gift, then back here to listen to my roomates cheer for the Red Sox. Sounds fun?...no...I know it doesnt. lol

I really want to recap this weekend so badly but Lauren did an excellent job in her entries...damn you! well I'm too lazy to really do it anyway, so good thing you did.

But one thing I must say, When Andrew came down with his hair cutt i think my heart stopped. It looks good, yes, but he needs his long hair back..just not as long and shaggy, but he needs it! I told him when we first became friends that when he cutt it I wouldnt be his friend anymore...well, i was lying, but still, I miss it!

So I'm not supposed to come home this weekend...scratch that, I'm not going home...Smitty is gone, Dana is gone, and Lauren has her own shit to do, and I think it's time for me to just emerse myself in FU for a little. There is a semi-formal ball this friday for the inaguration of our new  school President, but i dont have a suit or anything so I dont think i'm going. Next friday is the actual inaguration so I heard classes may be cancelled...I hope so, a 4 day weekend would indeed be nice!

Eh i have a long ass paper to write and a presentation on Buddhism to do, but I dont feel like it. surprised? Just boredddd...I wish I could just sleep till next friday..maybe Ill go try it now."

"event","So, today was murder. Eh, i dont feel like getting into the details but I'm at Andrews house, sleepingover tonite because I missed the 8:24 train back to NYC...which means that if I took the next one it would be midnight by the time I go into the Bronx and I just wasnt having it. 

Basically, I had to appear at the middletown municiple court for a speeding ticket i got, where this uber bitch charged me with going 19mph over the speed limit, during the summertime. grrrr. After two hours we were able to speak to the judge and I got a $180 fine but zero points thank god. Now, the reason I'm staying at Andrews is because we never told my mom that I got the ticket to begin with...and by this time she would just kill us (me and my dad)...not good to keep secrets!

Ehhh so today consisted of just traveling and waiting and bullshitting...no class tomorrow so yay to that! I'm supposed to be going to the zoo..we'll see how that works out. Ehh...just wanted to blow some steam, I'm out thugs..."

"event","Woo! So, I got out of my 1.5 day slump and thank god I did! Yesterday was a ton of fun in general and was exactly what I needed.. It basically consisted of shopping in NYC with Joanna all day long, that girl isnt afraid to shop let me tell you. It made me realized that I stopped buying clothes to feed my drug habbit. lol. I seriously gave up one addiction for another, and it seriously made me miss having the $ to get clothes. I mean it sounds ridiculous, but when you have your own style and ya give it up cause ya cant afford it...thats bullshit! I say the fucking coolest plaid sneekers....yes plaid...awesome..and I'm totally having buyers remorse...grrr. But being as it is...I mean, i still need to go in on a big purchase of non-clothes, and after that maybe I'll dropping the $ on clothes. Oh god, i saw an awesome jacket for girls that was leather and on the back had guess who? Oh yes, non-other than Bowie on the back! NYC is amazzzzinggggly fun. 

Joanna and I met up with Alaina Natale and Nicole Armileno and it was a blast. It was fun being with them, but sometimes all the girl stores would indeed get to me.  ... After the shopin we left the girls and Joanna and I got stopped on street by some guy working for Arista asking us about Outcast, which coincidentally Joanna bought their new cd that day! It was very funny because Joanna was so damn embarressed of being filmed, so look out for us on a Outcast promo! After that we headed to the movies @ Lincoln center to see Under the Tuscan Sun, which Joanna had to review for our school paper lol. It was a god movie i must admit, totally a chick flick, but the images in the movie were so beautiful and we both left feeling jealous of Andrew who is going to Italy next weekend! you fucker... BUT, the theater itself was awesome...totally the coolest movie theater I've been too. Afterwards on the way to the Ram van was stopped at the Metropolitan Opera House and sat around the beautiful fountain for a little and soaked in the atmosphere. There was a performance that night and everyone was all decked out for the opera. It just felt so nice to be in such a cultural place, and was a nice was to end off the day. We promised every Tues  or Wed was going to be a city day..besides the weekend of course.

Anyway, we got back to FU and I of course did zero work and instead chilled with Rich and Kina. Rich is seriously the funniest guy here, but he got narced by his roomates which sucked. Kina is full of so much energy and it was just great to sit around and make fun of each other..mostly Kina, while we watched Donnie Brasco. Ahhh good day. Today I had a ton of classes and this is the first time I could sit down and breathe! Ehhh this weekend is iffy, my uncle A is comming from FL for the weekend so I might go home...we'll see...but I really wanna get my kicks! God damnit! OOO and I also had a dream where I made up with Kevin, lol and Juliana Ribero was hanging out with katie Azcuy lol WTF?! The Kevin part was nice cause it felt real, but the other part was just strange...oo well! peace nigs!"

It started with having 4 classes, failing my much anticipated math midterm, continued with me working on my Info. Processing class homework from 9-2am, and dragging Andrew into it in order to try and help me from like 12-2. After I decided we should just give up, I tried to go to bed around 2:30, was freezing my ass off at like 3:30 and then got yelled to ""shut the fuck already' by one of my roomates...grrrr. 

Today, I slept from 1-6:30...then ate and watched TV... AWESOME! I'm stilling feeling sick, so its really not that pathetic..wait, am I justifying it to myself? Yes, yes I am. 

Tomorrow I'm going into the city with Joanna and meeting Nicole Armilino..yay! Shopping @ Urban Outfitters, and other randomness...should be fun!

I guess I just got to that point where everyone gets too eventually, its called LJ can start problems and endorses cowardice, but even I must admit that it has been much missed. I'm not going to even attempt to recap everything in between so I'm just gonna pretend that I've been updating everyday.

Ehh so I'm sitting here feeling like shit, but at least I'm home..yay! Its so amazingly nice to be able to come home and see my BFs. They are the only thing that helps me keep my sanity. Its kinda crazy to think about it tho, I dont know, its just such an intense relationship I'm so surprised that we all havnt snapped lol. but like Laurita said, DSDL 4 Life baby!

Last weekend was one for the books indeed. Friday- Came home, amazingly hungover...like RIDICULOUSLY hung over, after running 4 blocks through the Bronx to take the D to Penn with like 80lbs of alchol and shit with me, then taking the Transit home..I yaked everywhere lol. yaked..lol... anyway TBS and Saves the Day played, good times good time. Dana and Lauren slept over, andrew and I were sooo fucked up all nite long..till like 5 am when we passed out. 
SAT- We all left the Del to go Fordham...um, bowl shopping in the Village, met up with Danielle, ran into John Rogers and John Cantor, went to some ""feast"" as Danielle called it...and ohh yea i got ""fecal matter"" all over her leg. lol. We went back to FU, got stoned and drunk went to pugsleys back to my room and passed out. Sun- Dalai Lama @ central park! We got our hung over asses up at 830 and walked about 8 miles to find it and waited online for like 2.5 more hours..only us baby.   And thats the super condensed version of last weekend. 

So here I am...sitting here waiting for SMitty to get his ass out of the shower so we can chill then I'm going back to FU. I'm not looking foward to it considering I have a midterm in a class i'm like failing tomorrow and i feel like shit...yes a midterm. Dont know what to do...but...eh...i dont give a shit so what difference does it make!

The one thing I hate about eventful days is the fact that recapping them is too difficult. I think that I am going to start leaving that up to Dana Lauren and Lizzy..because they do it Oh so well.

Slowwwlyyy they are converting to Bowieism.......

Today was great..nothing better than Bowie when your high..it was a marvelous day..the one thing that made me sad was that most of my friends were in school. It would have been nice to have a free festival at my house. Next time.. 

Saw Angela Piccoli from camp tonite..shes so nice, i love that girl. 

Dana got a cell phone, Lizzy and Christina dropped off gifts for everyone this morning, no school, not friends with rayo anymore because I squirted invisible ink on her scarf, check from work, daredevil was not very good, got to spend time with ashley coppola and kenney. missing smitty and dana were the only bad parts of the day.

And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made

It really seems that whenever life is going well, something happens to totally fuck you up.

I'm just way too overwhelmed, and it was only one little thing that triggered it all..and the house of cards known as happiness came tumbling down. It's ridiculous..and it seems like everyone is now going through it. Or maybe it just seems that way because I am. Why are things so stagnant..they never change, and even when we think were being inventive..we arent. Everyone trys to hard..time to move to the mountains and eat cherrys and smoke weed all day...but then trashy world will come and fuck up the way you look at life for DAYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. FUCK trashy world..i'm moving to Holland. ...i feel unappreciated if you want to know. Thats really the bottom line."

It's funny because Caitlin and Angela always see me after science and comment on my sleeve patterns on the side of my face. Who cares...APES is a joke, and Mr Cole is awesome..so my weird in school dreams wont be ending anytime soon. The only thing is, that I'm getting too used to them..which is bad.

So after school..we made an aweful discovery... THE GON GON COOK/GAME GRUB/VIDEOGAMENESS/KRAMPUS has BEEN DELETED OFF OF TIVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Me, dana, lauren, and lizzy nearly fainted when we made the discovery...it was aweful. The only ray of light is that i was able to fix tivo, so now it reads the digital cable channels too..and i set it to record all the shows game grub appeared on. Neadless to say, I feel sick when I think about it. 

Anyway, we waited for Smitty to be free, then Lizzy went to work and we headed over to the Woodbridge mall, where I was going to get a Suicide Machines T-shirt. When we got there we realized there was no SM t-shirt...but guess who there was one of???? BOWIE!...i got it..its him as Ziggy Stardust...amazing shirt..i just fear i may be too fat for it, so I think I have to go back and get a medium. GOd damnit. Those hot topic shirts always seem bigger than they are lol. Anyway, the ground breaking event was SMITTY GETTING A HAIR CUT! Well it was really a 1/2 inch trim all the way around..the only problem was that the mexican lady left the back too long, so it basically had the potential to be a mullet..which i was just not going to allow to happen. So she trimmed it more, and the 3 of us plus andrew were happy..the blow drying out of his hair did freak us out for a little..but it became controlled and normal after a while. All good. We showed Deb when we dropped him off from dinner and she loved it. SO i am very happy.

Dinner- We'll of course it would be impossible for us to just have a regular dinner without anything strange going on..so we walk in the Luigis in lincroft..and there sits Dr Keshish with her husband. They were both incredibly rude and purposly didnt say hello or make eye contact or anything. asses. Anyway, me, smitty, and lauren (dana had to tutor) just sat there and talked about our pasts, and had some very revealing conversations..it was a really great dinner. so, after getting out waitress in trouble we departed for the somas, and then back here, and here I am now. I hope it snows tomorrow..that way smitty can get some $$, we all can go sleigh riding..and NO SCHOOL! ::knock on wood::

anyway the prom thing is hectic..it will be great..its just too much for me right now. We'll discuss that another day."

So I must say Dana and Lauren have done a perfect job in capturing our weekend..masterful ladies..masterful. They did such a good job there is really nothing I can elaborate on, which sucks considering how buring my desire to update has been. Honestly..there are too many unproductive members..you soft core losers. We need more hardcore abusers up in here!! LJ must be reborn!  so i think i'm going to take the privacy off mine, because LJ isnt just for me..it's for everyoneeee. I'll just make private anything bad..


So i must agree with Laurens little I love my friends bit...honestly..we did nothing and had the best time. That is the true test of friends. Jessica, Lauren, Dana, Carly..you are collectivly the funniest girls ever, and individually amazing friends. You guys are great, and I must say that I just can not wait till summer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So today I went to Smittys..and I must say that I was so happy that I had the chance..because I think I may have finally proven myself worthy to the rents. Hopefully my nightmars of Frank standing above me with a large knife will be all but worries of the past...     Oh and Smitty..ur room is awesome, and the house is amazing..I loved it all. And yes I am directing it to you, even though you claim never to read it..I'm not convinced..lol

So this weekend comming up may not be so innocent as the previous. Even tho friday I had my share of mischeif..lol jessicaaaaaaa...trixy..oh god. I'm glad sat was normal..it allowed my immune system enough time to work for a little and heal my fucking foot!

I need something dramatic to happen so I can write a long entry about it..I find it amazing that life is a smooth ride right now..amazing. and its the result of having laid back friends..it honestly is. C'EST LA VIE!"

EHhh...ok i will.

Thursday: Jess and Dana comeover...yeah retarded 100%...it was seriously one of the funniest times ever. I neever laughed so hard in my entire fucking life! The ""BR"" vest that I had on from the 5th grade play...Jessica lighting the floor on fire..and then almost her foot.. ""Marijuana..not so funny now""..move to picture of us laughing until will die due to lack of oxygen. lol....oh god..I can't even think about it. Then Smitty and Lauren came over and just enjoyed our retarded company...good god, then it was time for work. My friends there knew I was a mess. Its bad enough that I told them my new years story and they still make fun of me..so when I waled in and they started making 'bowl inhaling sounds'..I couldnt help but break down laughing..it was aweful. That day dragged on forever..but by the end i was fine.

Friday: Dana, Jess, Lauren come over...maddness breaks loose.. my cleaning lady had to have known..some randomness with Andrew Oren in my house and Kevin Cisak or however its spelt.. who knows what I was even doing. Kevin shows up...smitty smokes infront of my house..it was negative degrees..insanity. I went back inside..and I guess we watched the ""ring video""...oh god. OH GOD, is all I can say about that video.. I'm thinkning about making copies of it and selling it to people..no doubt I would make a fortune. Then..I think we started watching Lord of The Rings. It was amazing..it honestly was one of the craziest things to watch. I dunno..it felt like it was true..like some forgotten history..my mind was basically going insane. I kept fighting the sleep..my breathren Dana lost her battle..Bby the end of it..it was pizza time..fuck ups at Luigis fucked it up!! Lincroft luigis that is... anyway, from there Lizzy and Chris came over, Jess left, and we all got dressed in costumes to go to the key club dance...HILARIOUS. We were so retarded..I cant even explain how dumb we were acting..and the sad thing is that we were all normal by the time Lizzy and chris came. It was such a blast! We dominated that party lol. Moshing with those girls..dancing on the stage, and jumping around strangers.. Lizzy captures the moment very well in her LJ. ......from there we got smokes, smitty ran around my car at the traffic light in his costume..and we came back here and watched ""Hookers:Again"" on HBO..funny funny shit.

"event","So insomnia strikes again..before I go into why I'm here when I should be sleeping i fucking HAVE to get this off my chest..

Ok so you know when your just completly retarded and you experience or see something that just makes an impact on you..and it like sticks with you and you just think about it randomly for no reason. Well I have had the suicide machines ""our time"" stuck in my head for DAYS now..like 2 entire fucking days, and it reminds me of something that is going to make no sense to anyone but myself, dana, andrew, and jessica because i explained it to her today..and by talking about it, it makes me only think about it more.

So at the New Direxion party, for those of you who saw us..we were totally retarded...like no question. I must say that that was one of the craziest things ever to be witnessed. number one, ND was AMAZING for the unfortunatly short time we heard them play..but oh my god..my perception of reality was so distorted that nite, that it still freaks me out. Dana and i spoke about it afterwards and we both agreeded that we were just totally sketched out by the ""scene"", and that skank pits are like total emotional outlets for the people in them... now I know everyone has witnessed tons of skank pits, but im sorry, there was one at birch that i still think about because all those people just looked so terribly sad and like.. fucking depressed and fucked up. To be honest its this damn song that makes me think about the concert, which makes me think about this emotional skank pit haaha, which makes me feel all wierd because it's a wierd thing to randomly think about, and since this song has been in my head for 2..going on 3 days, all I have been thinking about is what I said before. It really is like this specific part in the song that drives me insane..oh god this makes no sense. I cant explain it..I just see the image of those girls..for it was an all girl pit..over and over again in my head. The suicide machines are just driving me nuts.. 

I think the real reason for this insanity is that my body is like kicking out all the shit that has been circulating in me for months now..months? who am i kidding.   ..and our 1 week..going on 2 week long break is making my body crazy.Today at lunch I was having wierd type-flashback moments, where everyone did something they typically do when they are high, like lauren and her hair, greg and his 'oh gods', kevin and his laugh, I told everyone about it and they knew what I was saying, so I didnt really feel like a total lunatic.I also yelled at alot of people..I felt like I had PMS. Last night I passed out at 9:45..the last time I did that i was in like 4th grade. Today its 9 and I'm asleep on the couch but force myself to wake up and go to bed..then dana calls and I'm awake till now...thinking about random things. 

College has been on my mind alot as of late..I keep wondering about where I'll go and how often Ill see everyone..and how important is being close, to me..its not imporant..but should it be? My parents are trying to give me a guilt trip on it, but then again what arent they trying to give me a guilt trip on. Congrats Jess about Colgate..you lucky bitch. They are def. convinced I'm on some type of drugs..I'm fucking laying on the couch and my mom walks by..stops..gives me one of her fucked up looks, and asks ""Stephen, what are you doing?""...my response was that ""I'm jogging..what type of question is that? What do you think I'm doing?""...which only provoked a fight on how I'm moody and distant from the family. Then of course I had to go and ruin dinner by getting into a fight with my brother over him kicking my feet and pretending not to realize it..then my dad made fun of the fact I was yelling at him for pretending and aggregating the situation..which made me get up and leave. MY brother can be a real shit sometimes, and then people wonder why I'm mean to him. My parenst are already on the fucking edge with me..all he does is motivate them. Honestly, if god forbod they ever found something, i knew they would jump into the fucking air and shout ""I KNEW IT!""...so anyway Then my parents wanted to drive the explorer to some meeting and I was so fucking random and said I need to pick up a book and fill the tank with gas in that car..reason being it smelt like cigs. and I didnt feel like getting myself torn a new asshole. once again..wierd looks.

Today just blew.

Smittys fucking iguana is dying and I feel like shit. I feel soo fucking bad considering he's had it for like 7 years now.. it just made my day much worse knowing how much that sucks.

after school was fucking key club, the biggest waste of my life, and then kevin and lauren came over and we did fucking nothing..I cracked and smoked by myself. I couldnt help it, I thought it would make my day better. Oh, and on sat i fucking poked myself in the mouth while brushing my teeth and now, I swear its infected. It hurts like a bitch, and I used listorine to try and kill everything..and it would have been less painful if just rinsed my mouth with lava.

anyway I'm just sitting here not really seeing sleep anywhere in sight and there are still so many things I want to talk about but I dont know if I should even bother. Jess' entries have totally motivated me to go off on my own tangents on non-chill people..or fake-chill fags. I cant take it right now.. I need to not be home.

I feel like things have been really wierd lately..like funky vibes everywhere and from everyone..I swear trashy world is meshing with our world..its time to like fucking move to Holland. People to seem to be unhappy this week..maybe it's just grades and shit. Whatever..just stop being so negative cause I know you are!"

"event","Oh man, what a weekend. Honestly..all this random maddness is pathetic. People are going to start to think that we make this shit up, if they dont already. ::I lika dat shit, we drinka dat shit:: lol. Anyway, ahhh yesterday was such a blast.

So Harolds: ME, Dana, Lauren, Tessa, John, Chris, Lizzy, Carly, David, DJ...god, did I forget someone? ..Smitty and kevin couldnt make it..we are all terribly disapointed needless to say. So, I ate one cheeseburger that was like..4. John ate a whole cow, Lauren got a SIDE of maccaroni that was about..oh, i dont know..the size of a bathtub, DJ and David got 1 (4 cheeseburgers) with enough bacon on them to feed China for a year, Dana, Lizzy & Carly, split a mountain of Turkey. Tessa had water. it was a blast...to bad it took everyone so long to get there..I kno it's a touchy subject so I wont get into it.

sooo like 4 hours later we leave and pick up smitty..lauren drops off Tessa & Carly and picks up kevin. Christina comes over..and all maddness breaks lose in my house. Smitty and I go up stairs for some expresso..and when we come back, DJ has a tape mullet on, Chris is like hogtied on the floor and then taped to some pole, LAuren falls over some rug spilling water every which way, andd then DJ gets a bald spot cut into his head because we couldnt get the duck tape off. We tried soaping it, vaselining it..but eventually we had to cut it. Absolute carnage. So by the time we all leave to go bowling..its like 930.

We get to the bowling lanes..and who is there? For all you hardcore LJ addicts, you may remember and update when I talk about some kid from work who was fired and blamed me for it, so when we ran into him at  adiner in a state of idiocy, his friends like haressed us..but we werent sure because we were totally retarded. ...well he was there. Lizzy comes running outside to shout that the ""Assgrabber"" is here, for that is one of the very non-flattering names he is known by in the ol BR. So, we all exchanged dirty looks at each other and go our merry way.

After a fucking hour of dancing, shouting, videogameness ::LOL::, fucking on the table in the back room...eh hem lauren and smitty... throwing bowling balls at each other, IT WAS TIME TO BOWL.

Only, daivd, kevin, chris, john, bowled..everyone else was too cheap. So Coyle throws the ball like a ""Four year old girl who is just learning how to bowl the way her grandfather taught her"" as kevin put it..aka. SMelly McSmell Smell, but his girly bowling was no match for Smellys expert bowling trash ball spin..which brought kevin to victory over coyle. The overall winner was Chris, who won both games I believe, but lost later that night when he threw up his cow in the middle of the night. Aww poor baby!

Today was work, homework, andddd..i'm thinkin about puling a smitty and not sleeping all night..god knows I have enough work to fill the hours. Anyway its been a while since a real update...all you other deadbeats better get moving..you know damn right who you are. I'm outt."

Gina Nodo is my new BF..and all her friends too. Danielle Ferris is my hero..as usual the Ferrises are amazing.
Oh..and in reference to the little incident, because I have control and respect for my friend Allison I won't get into it..but it was unwarrented and sad. It was simply a nasty and cowardly thing to do and just know that I never said anything mean or negative EVER..and that my pal Andrew is none to pleased. Next time, take a good look in the mirror, get on line earlier and grow up. Whatever.."

"event","Oh man. So today we had some more ""You Want To Smoke In Here? Fine. $130.00"" business after school, and a fun little Drug and Alcohol Youth Alliance meeting where I just sat there and made fun of Shari Calman. Good times, good times. I'm so glad that DJ and Dana are the newest members of the Alliance..yaa!

So within 10 minutes of comming home, of course drama has to strike. 

This really isn't something that would be appropriate for me to discuss openly on LJ, but it looks like D.S.D is causing all sorts of problems throughout the county. All this tension isn't good for our performance tonite..we have to be on top of our game. 

What it basically boils down to, is that people who are condisceding, critical, and try to make you feel worthless..are not your friends. Even if you have known them for nearly a decade...a friend doesn't treat a friend like shit. So is it a surprise when you tend to want to spend time with easy going people..that of which you just KNOW will never start any shit or drama? No..it shouldn't be. It was just a matter of time before it happened...I'm just convinced that some people just are never happy, and that they spend most of their miserable little stuck up lives trying to convince themseleves that they are. Its fake, and the world knows it. To look down on someone for liking a certain type of hair style...you have to be kidding. Live in your little strait jacket christian world, cause I'd rather laugh with the sinners and cry with the saints when it comes down to it. God..that was a BJ quote by the way. It has been mounting..and so it is time for it to crashhh like it should have months ago. 

The sad thing is.. it's senior year...and it's taken this long for everyone's true colors to show.

That isnt directed to a specific person..I've been hearing the same shit from everyone..and if not from the person directly..from someone else who is sick of someone else..but can never tell them...why? because they are ""friends"", naturally.

What is a friend?...a friend is someone who you can talk to anything about and never give you a dirty look or make you want to stop talking. A friend doesnt laugh at your ideas when they know your being serious. A friend..is someone who you can just sit with and do nothing for hours..and love it. You dont try to avoid a true friend, you always pick up their calls...and you don't need to EVER convince them they are your friend, by attaching titles like ""Forever"", or ""BEST""...if your truly friends, you don't need them.

It's amazing how people will stick with the same group of friends just because they don't like change..and when change occurs..all hell breaks loose..every fucking time. Every fucking time someone new comes into the picture, dirty looks and nasty faces, or little side comments are always in play. And what is the bitter friend bitter about? Losing a friend they don't even really care for anyway? Because if they were such good friends the other friend wouldnt be finding new ones..now would they?

It's funny how one minute you think you'll know this person forever..youve talked about being in each others weddings or whatever, and saying your each others kids will call you ""uncle"" or ""aunt""...but then the next day you hear something that has been said about you, or maybe you yourself even slip..and ::poof::....nothinggg is left. People will argue that a TRUE friend would never let that happen...that REAL friendships last forever.  Well a true friend is what exactly? The bottom line is that when little shit drives you crazy..your not true friends.. you just think you are because you find comfort in telling yourself that. Well your not.
I thought that I had a pretty good idea of what a true friend was. It seems that people may not put the same price on friendships that you may..that its easy to forget about all the good times...is it? 

""A true friend stabs you in the front not the back""

Nowww..that is the most true statement I have ever heard. I love that saying just because it is so true. In all honesty, it is inevitable that shit is going to come up, so when it does stab them in the front..and if you can survive it..then your friendship is golden...if not, then you just saved alot of time talking through people and behind backs. The problem is that when most shit occurs, its behind the back...those wounds are usually fatal..trust me.

anyway, I said alot..I think alot of it makes sense..but I could be wrong.

Tomorrow: Hmm..battle of the bands and 2 open houses. 1 problem...after this week I don't know if it would be in my best interest to engage in my usual weekend activities. Damnit. I guess ultimately the group will decide..this is a democracy isnt it? Something tells me DSD my playing it cool for a little..call me crazy but after this week..i dont kno. DSD is playing tomorrow..make sure you come to support your favorite local heros...we'll be signing autographs for $5 a piece.

SAT: Smitty may be working, Danington is working...I'll be doing nothing. Then in the afternoon were going to Harold's...oh man..they have the best food EVERRRRRR. I mean their cakes are like the size of small hills...its going to be orgasmic.

It's still long so now it's just going to be longer for the next time I get it cut. I know that I want longer hair...I think Smitty has the best hair ever..but it's his and I can't gank his flava. I think I just need my own version of lenghty hair. Dana says she likes it now..what does she know. lol.. Maybe it just needs to be lighter..Dana thinks darker..need I say it again?

So Jessica breaks into the LJ scene with a bang..your first entry was great...like I said, I wish I was there! 

The school day was fine..non-stressful, non-difficult, full of drama..even though I feel like I have been avoiding it so well lately. After school Me, DJ, Dana, and some other chicks painted anti smoking signs in the bathroom..hence my subject..clever isnt it? Smitty didn't come..maybe he felt like a hipocrite..I dont know. I know it's going to be defaced within 24hours.. but I mean, if you didnt already know I'm president of the Drug and Alcohol Youth Alliance in Holmdel..so I gotta do what I gotta do.

This weekend is still up in the air. DSD is performing at battle of the bands on Friday..I think the songs ""Rose Petals are Not For Eating"", and ""I Can't Feck You Cause Theres a Shoppingcart In My Car"" are going to be played...personally I'm looking foward to playing the new single, ""Painting in the Bathroom...That Ship Has Sailed"". It's going to fantastic either way.     The only problem is that we all also wanted to go bowling...AND now I hear that there may be two open houses...jesus..decisions decisions..

Next weekend are midterms..I totally forgot..my brain has been a piece of shit as of late. I've developed this wierd stutter..not's not really a stutter..it's more like I'm choking on the next word..or I say the sentence in the completely wrong order. It's like in the 60s, when stuttering became a technique in songs because singers couldn't help stuttering due to some of the drugs they were on...like ""Changes"" by Bowie..amazing song. Hope you enjoyed that little tidbit of information. Tidbit? Ok I'm going to kill myself now."

At least we know why it happened tho..like, I feel better knowing specifically why all this happened..and even though its complete bullshit, I'm glad I know.

So this weekend I hear we are going bowling..like at Strathmore Lanes or something. I think it will be fun..no matter what we do, we always have fun anyway..just as long as the mall isnt involved.

I'm a fucking shady friend..I'm pretty sure that a new low for me, because I have always been anything BUT the shady friend. I honestly can say that Mr and Mrs Soma are amazing awesome people..but... Frank haunted my dreams all of Sat night, and even my mid-day stupers on Sunday. I'm so damn afraid there are no words..and the last thing in the world that I want to do is get Andrew in trouble. It's a shitty spot I must say.

So last night SMitty comes over and Me, Smitty, Dana and carlos all have a little too much fun. I mean..when Andrew was on the floor in the corner rolled into a ball..I felt like calling the police and just turning ourselves in. ..To sum it up..we were in capable of strining together 1 min long coherent conversations..and I never laughed so hard in my life. Honestly..today I dont feel like divulging all the details of the night before..but all I have to say is that I tasted the summer and it sucks to have to wait so much longer!

"event","Give me some of that gamegrub...wow..tonite was like the perfect nite minus one big thing..smitttyy couldnt come. I have nothing to say except here it goes:

Me & Dana go to her house, I meet old,mean and creepy grandma, and see all the stole signs and aircompressors the Ziembas had. I had to go to the bathroom but couldnt step on the floors with ym sneakers, so DJ picked me and up and carried me..good times.

From there, we go to my house call laurn and the three of us chill with..carlos. After a hillarious session in my car, we fall onto my driveway and drag our asses to the basment. Once there we decided to watch the ""high video"" thats saved on my Tivo.  To describe the High Video is impossible..it only can be found when ur high, and i was just lucky enought to catch it. IT is just hilarious..gone gone cook gone gone cook..take a bite homie, tell it how it sHlooks.          If lauren said that stupid phrase one more time..I would have killed her.  and shloosks is spelt right..i dont think its supposed to makes sense.

From there we venture to Luigis in Lincroft..sorry guys. Um..I dont remember much except that we all got 3 waters, 3 chicken tenders, and all 3 owed $6....think about it, 6 is divisable by 3! It was nuts..

Then we saw a cloud that looked like a carrot.

20min later we start the car and head for the carwash....what a mistake. By the time we got there it had closed 2 min before, but the were nice a nd reopened it for us..can u imagine being fucking toasted and trying to manuver an SUV onto some dame 2 in track?! 15min later, we find ourselves going through the car wash...a freaky, experience. We got out of there, headed back here and the Alia came over and we headed to Red Bank. Good God, i saw Camielle Peylo AGAIN! I see that girl everywhere, and im glad i do..because she seems awesome.

We went to f&s, went to haagen daze and then to iinternet cafe to see is Testa was on! SHE WASNT so, we sadly decide to leave and on the way out..of course, we run into Testa. I dont know what line of shit we fed her, but I feel bad about it cause I REALLY wanted to see her..im sure it was amazing.

God, im so glad livejournal stopped being a bitchington and let me update! Ive been burning wit LJ urges!

So we came to my house, showed Alex the high video...being that she wasnt high i think all she saw was a black television and just laughed at us laughing. lol but then again..i can be wrong. She left after some gay ass MTV sex movie..fucking stupid, and then the 3 amigos headed to Blockbuster, and while there chilled with Carlos. OH GOD! forgot to mention...
probably at the peak of our stupidness in luigis..some fucking little girl walks and in and hugs lauren! It was one of her former campers, and the girls dad worked in one of the stores in the plaza, so of course she wandered into us. We just stared at her and couldnt stop laughing..it wasnt her that was funny..i think just the situation...anyway back to carlos 2.

Yea, at some point during the ride I told everyone to pray that i had a good unconciousness, because right now I felt just as much like a passanger as they did. IT was great..
We spoke to Smitty and e told us how he felt sick from drinking huge glasses of orange juice..i think thats what he said at least.

god, my head is still throbbing..anyway we went to blockbuster and on the way out Lauren put down my back seats and I lifted up a shopping cart and shoved it in the back of my car..while people we watching. We sped out of that are and slowed down while by chilis..and just as i was saying ""i need to drive my best""..a fucking red corrvette runs there stop and would have crashed into us if i didnt swerve! MY LIFE WOULD HAVE ENDED IF I GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT THEN. So of course, this car was infront of me or next to me the entire ride home..untill it got to Julianas house and pulled into her driveway..I wanted to die.

From then I dropped off the chicks and here I am..dazed and tired.  Tomorrow SMitty sleeps over and I can finally christen the new piece..I love life and I love friends. For all of you guys who are unhappy with ur friends and stick witht the same people just because u have known them so long.....find new friends cause you dont know how much your life sucks untill you do.

So today was a pretty good day at school...everyone was in rare form..maybe it was just me..and I really agree with Dana's reason for it. I was actually on my last like..3..so of course after school I had to run to good ol' 7 eleven to replenish my..Centrum..you know those vitamins?..sorry..I cant spell excederin..see,i think i spelt it wrong.

Soooooo yesterday was alot of fun...playing mind tricks with Dana had me cracking up..this friday is going to be fantastic..my parents said smitty could stay over of course, and washing Dana's hair is going to be a BLAST!!..by the way I think my stomach is still recovering from eating rose petals at Jennys...bad idea andrew

Goth girl is a freak..Dana you honestly need to keep her away from us! She freaks me out..those big eyes..big shoes...wierd..face. Anyway, after school I spent like TWO FUCKING HOURS restructuring Key Club..I honestly hate it with a passion. The new structure is totally fool proof..even tho thats what we said about the last one...so we'll see

Ok, so my BF Alia has been sick and today is her Christmas..and I miss my baby soo much! ALEX!! you need to come back to school, and we need to chill sooo badly! How funny is that dream I had about Nick?! It was soo realistic too.

Smitty is at the zoo right now, and I resent that zoo comment Dana made! I love the zoooooo! Dana doesnt like it because it reminds her too much of being at home.oooooooo..even tho we probably know someone whos house is much more closely related... lol

Sat is New Direxion..im so excited. Smitty can come..and this has obviously made D&S beyond happy. O, evryone! The Drug Sniffing Dogs are performing at Holmdel High Schools Battle of the bands! I'm not sure what the date is yet..you needa check back for that.

Soo tomorrow is outtacontrol, friday is shampoo fest, sat is nex direxion-o-ramma... im so happy rite now..my hands are like shaking...but i dont think its from happiness 

My friend Carly wrote this poem about me today..most of you probably wont get it, but I felt like immortalizing it in LJ. here it goes

""Steve""

Oh Steve,
how you are such a friend,
Always making me laugh to the very end.
Looking like Cary
is Ashley's mom,
and ""World War II"" is the best theme for prom.
We make fun of Jordan,
for in the hallways he will prance,
yet we are the ones with a ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" dance.
I steal your lunch nearly everyday,
while arguing about affirmitive action-white people all the way!
At the beach everyone sucked,
execpt you me and Lauren, and both of us had our questions and doubts about ______ ____
The year is almost done,
leaving only a half,
but whatever will come
we'll just stand there and laugh.
-carly

k guys..till tomorrow"

"event","Another day..

So today I woke up at 12:30, cleaned my room while watching MTVs Osbourne Marathon all day long and stopped cleaning at 3:30. Then I went to Kevins house where I met up with him, Angela, and Suzanne and proceeded to go to Outta Control Smoke Shop.   Can you imagine? I went to Outta Control w/o Dana and Smitty! D.S.D. was seperated today! Andrew was off killing wild animals and Dana was trapped in bagel world and then with her family! It wasnt as amazing without you guys...

SO i got myself a very nice gift. Im sure many a good memory will result from it.   or maybe be lost by it. lol

Bascially from there I went to Jennys Sweet 17 where I basically chilled with Smitty the whole time, before he went off to get blasted with his cuz. DAMN YOU SMITTYYYY. Turns out everyone there was blasted except me..but it was better that way because I finally met Deb & Frank and I really wanted to make a good impression on them. I hope the liked me..

Jenny looked absolutly amazing and so did all the girls there. Nothing to complain about when it comes to that. So now I'm home and the day is done. I missed Dana today and everyone else...whoever they are. I think I'm gonna watch Ave Ventura when Nature Calls..come visit me at BR tomorrow!

Danington- sorry I missed you at work today..next weekend, I promise!

K, im out like a white kid in a knife fight."

"event","Ok..so it totally freaks me out when all these completely random people start telling me how they love my livejournal. It's damn scary considering a majority of the crap in here is incriminating and negative. So..stop reading this if I dont know you..wierdo          it really looks like I'm going to have to start privatizing some of my entries..which sucks, but people are soo damn gay.

Anyway, We gave Smitty his gift! I'm glad he liked it...we got him an engraved zippo that said ""Smitty"" of the front and ""D.S.D"" on the back. It's awesome and I hope it brings him many a good smoke.

So tonight was such a fun night..and there was no need for any other..eh how do i say it...things...to make it fun. Dana..your so strange when your not high.  j/king lol..wow i hate j/k     

Our entire night consisted of driving around and thinking of places to go. Our first stop was Lizzys house where we went to greet her friend that none of us really knew. Lets just say that our effort to share the love wasnt recipricated so we left and drove to Grove to bitch to Lizzy. Then we went to the mall, Acme, and temptations. Naturally there's a story at each of those places, but I dont feel like getting into them. The main point is that you know people are special when you can do nothing and have alot of fun doing it. Jess Leong..we missed ya.

Side note: Dana drove across her lawn and her dad hunted us down and found us at Lizzys house..a person who Dana doesnt even know. It was hysterical..Mr Z. is a nut...huh nuts about candy?lol..quote of the week baby.

Eh Jennys is tomorrow and i got her a nice gift..I think at least. So that will be my night, but who knows what ill be doing in the day. Hm..i think Iron Chef is starting"

"event","So, I am going crazy with the bowie icons...it has NOTHING to do with Dana, Jess and Lauren being shitheads.. it has everything with to do with me needing a better looking icon. I mean, I have to give bowie the representation he deserves. SO I'm keeping the ""lesbian"" one which is the cover of his amazing album ""ALADDIN SANE""...look at the title..say it outloud and realize the genius of bowie. still don't see it?..your dumber than i thought.

So school was nothing special, I wore the same AE shirt that adam has..i guess great minds think alike. I spent lunch talking to Jess Cozzetta and missin smitty..Jess is like my female half. She told me how much she likes Dana..everyone has been telling me how much they like her. Dana is just so damn popular. Eh, for the record Something Corporate drives me insane..in a bad way..and so do pop-up windows...I'm looking at one right now and I refuse to close it because it's still letting me type...it wants me to visit http://yesimdrunk.com  lol i think thats kinda funny.

You know what else is funny? Our waiter from our trip from hell IMed my friend Erin. He told her that if she every wanted to visit PA again she could stay with him..Bobby is such a pimp. 

Jess..your LJ entries are always so emotional and so thought provoking...you need to stop that. it hurts my mind. anyway I think i should pick up my paycheck from BR while we await Smitty waking up..why wasnt he in school again? Oh because he didnt feel like it. Damn you Andrew.

O yeah..my friend Lizzys friend Chris is here from Cali and since shes working today I think we might chill with him..cause we are just such a nice group of people. So we'll see. i'll be back..and tell me which bowie u like better..i have another one 2..i guess ill use it next time."

"event","So the Drug Sniffing Doggs are finally back in action! It's soooo damn good to see Dana again and especially Smitty considering he has been gone for like 3 years now. I love it how Danington calls us her boys..

I have to say that one of the 1st things I did when I got back from vacation was check my email..and when I saw Kaet's posted comment..I wanted to cry. DAMNIT PEOPLE! Next time Kaet I'll be there..i'll try not to disappoint.

SO Lauren has a LJ, and I must say that since that annoying bitch decided to stay home and pretend to be sick while she just felt herself up all day, she certaintly didnt cut back on her LJ entries. STOP polluting my friend page with all ur pointless crap...and make another nasty Bowie comment and ur DONE. DONEEEE DO YOU HEAR ME?! ..oh and Ms. LJ pro, who has had livejournal for what is it? 2 days now? decides to make fun of my posts in my own entries...go fuck yourself!...or maybe stop fucking yourself in your case. oooooooooooo. smokeddd.

Eh so I guess I should fill you in on the Woodloch Pines DISASTER. Honestly, I dont feel like boring you with the miniscule details of my 4 day trip..but the gist is that I went up to PA with my family and a bunch of other families from Holmdel, and i drove there and back with my good friend Erin, whos family was also there.
SO my little chill group was me,erin, andrew buckley,ricky filipelli, and rob soave (guitar player for Dingus). Basicallyy...myself andrew and ricky get blazed and 2nd nite and have a really crazy night..complete with being chased by deer which was about the fucking scariest event of my life, and watch Star Wars Episode II in the ""movie room""...that movie is soo fucked up and you dont notice unless ur high..TRUST ME.  Deer are the pets of Satan.

So new years eve to make a long story short..the guys decide to toke on Erins balcony and basically get caught when like 5 parents come to Erins room to check in on the girls <erin and her sis and a bunch of family friends>...and we bascially are hiding on the balcony for no reason. My parents and all the other guys parents are told about it..and we are all brutally attacked when we see them. Eh..as of rite now they are thinkin that we were out there cause we were afraid that one of the girls dads wouldnt allow us to be in the room...but its weak..and a whole bunch of shit is going on..so who the fuck knows..i think im smellin a drug test. Anyway thats the WAYYY abreviated version...poor Rob from Dingus..he isnt into the scene and its our fault hes fucked...sorry bro.

Speaking of the scene..honestly..everyone from Colts Neck needs to know that I'm NOT ADDICTED TO DRUGS because I def. think everyone thinks it. You guys just see me at bad times..well good times..but you know what I mean. Honestly one day we can all chill sober..so that way I can put faces to your names.                 joking.

anyway banana killed me so I'm out..and by the way.. danington I like ur new pic much better..dont listen to Lauren..shes jealous. -later

my god this entry is so incriminating. this damn thing is going to be the end of me."

"event","Wow. I have soo much shit to say right now it's..fantastic. There is honestly no such feeling better as the one you recieve when you come home from a concert soaked in sweat, change your clothes, and make yourself something to eat. Yes there is. BEING at the concert with fucking kick ass people. I must say that Dana, Lauren, Lizzy, Jess, David, Kevin, Mykittytin, and Chris are great people to rock out with. Holy god, I almost forgot Jolly-O! ..Jolly is my friend who I met at TSL & RBF and since then I have magically seen her at every concert I've gone too since then..minus the vines but that wasnt a real concert anyway.

So I worked from 8-2..came home, made 4,000 phone calls, realized that my friend Tim cant come, realized that our pal Laura isnt comming, made sooo many attempts to get Jess Cozzetta to come..but ended up with the group I listed above. And we waited in the damn freezing cold..me, kevin, my bro, lauren & heather..whos heather you ask? Doesnt really matter. Anyway, around 7 waltzes in lizzy and her bro we let them in..and thats already after we let in Dana and Jess and my random friend Jolly and her friend. THEN lizzys brothers friends and Jess' stalker make a pathetic attepmt to come in out little group...were you fucking kidding me? ANd they had the nerve to be mad when we wouldnt let all of them in! There was like 5 more people! I thought those 12 year olds were gonna stab us with their little pins. So to make a long story short we entered, met up with Lauren, lost heather, endured 2 terribly boring bands, dana threw up, I nearly passed out during TSL and jess and I formed our usual kick ass mosh pit. Somewhere in there we had an amazing time.

So this was my brother Daivd's first concert..and something magical happened.. he got in the head with the starting lines drum stick at the end of the show! And guess what little whore ran and picked it up...LAUREN. You dirty little slut..thanks for ruining my brothers special moment.

So I find it neccessary while the rage is still built up in my mind..to bring up the 3 types of people who I HATE HATE HATE at concerts.

Subject A:    The people who just dont fit the scene and have no business being there. Why the fuck are you freaks there? So you can say you were at a 'punk rock show' and blah blah blah...people notice that you dont belong..so stop comming

Subject B:     The fat ass pop-punk chick who thinks that crowd surfing is the coolest thing ever. Listen you fat whore, some people just are not made to go crowd surfing and a little clue is when your legs need to be greased in order for your lesbo friend to slide you into your dickies..DONT CROWD SURF. and the worst part is the look of total jubilation that you have on your face..while your crushing the heads of countless others...you make me sick.

Subject C:     The gigantic freakshow mountains of human mass that instead of being nice to those who are smaller, do nothing but crush people and block their views. Damn you freaks. You should be the nicest out of everyone there...looking out for people who are smaller and trying to use your size to help..instead u abuse it like shitheads..damn you all.

sorry about that..i felt it was important.

So tomorrow I drive up to PA and leave Danington by her self. What is this?! No steve..no smitty..who the hell is left?! lol. I'm gonna be back the 1st tho..just in time for school..yippee. Call lauren..she loves u. I'm going to miss you soo much..i dont know what Im going to do with myself.

Tonight battle scars are going to be impressive. Already I see a gigantic bruise on my knee..my right foot was cut thru the shoe somehow in 3 places..i realized my necklace was destroyed and my back hurts but i cant physically see the spot that is killing me. And i would totally and obviously do it all AGAIN. TBS was ""orgasmic"" to use the words of Dana and TSL was consistantly amazing. Ok, trust me there is an entry comming up on ANTI-TSL bashing..because im sick of it. SICK.  So David got the entire bands autograph with 3 min..like i lost him, he reappeared 3 min later and had all their sigs. I was happy for him..he looked like he was in heaven...i think he had an awesome 1st concert..o wait lauren ruined it, nevermind. j.k.

Soo many things to talk about, liek kevin leaving his pipe in his jacket..which was locked in heathers car..which she drove away in..lol good times. and how about those gay punks? Craziness. 

I want to leave off on this note: Sometimes trying to share the love just isnt worth it..and tonight was a PRIME example. You kno that of which I speak.

Also..Lizzy i had such an amazing time and i really love how we stuck together for the night. Lauren, Jess, Dana, you complete me..i think we found our group."

Ya know what else i miss right now? FREINDS! Not one person from skool has txtd me to see how i was, rang me to ask me to go places :( NOT ONE! It would be nice to be asked how i am - which is fuckin lousy!  I have a broken ankle and now with mi cast off its realli painful trying to WALK AGAIN! What is the point me being friends with u lot if u dont take any notice of how i am!?!?  No i cant walk atm but that was tuesday i got mi cast off! Its been a week and a day! U had that long to ask me!

I wanna say thanx to Sarah for bein a perfect angel at this point in time :) Shes been here when all i needed is a hug and tellin me its all gonna be alright!  Thats all i need :)  Even her  house is an outing to me!

I would just love for one of u to come round...see how i am...txt me...ring me...even on MSN! I was stuck in mi house for 3 1/2 weeks - never goin out neway! Stayin downstiars in 4 walls isnt that gr8! Laura thank you for coming over :) i realli needed it - but saying those things wasnt nice u kno!

Well im gonna stay on here all night because i cant get too sleep :(

Luv ya - NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well mi life is just getting worse.  I feel so down atm and i just feel nothing can get better.

Skool is just a waste of time for me because i dont like turning up to try to do lessons when people are ust laughing at me, taking the piss, calling me names, spreading shit behind my back...Well u kno...now ive had enough.  I cant take it anymore...i try to stay strong infront of ppl!  When people call me i do stick up for myself but people just carry on.  They think oh she wont keep sticking up for herself so carry on.  I do try but i just get so tired and sick of shouting.

In year 7 i felt on top of the world - no worries.  Well i didnt need to have any.  I had loadz of friends - who i wouldnt dare talk to now.  I used to be m8s wiv all tha lads n lasses from the class but now i h8 some of them and like talk to a few of them but the rest - they would probably snap my head off for talking to them.  Well *************** is a bitch! Now everywhere i turn its big nose this big nose that! I dont want it anymore!!

I just try to move on - and feel like myself but its realli hard when im being put down all the time.  I feel like people(hu i wnt name) are just spreadin shit behind my back and i dont want it.  People hu i have trusted, just go and tell secrets which ive sworn ppl not to say.  It hurts me that ppl wud do that - when they are supposed to be my friend!!

I just want my life back to the way it was!!

When Hanisa left it broke my heart.  people may see thats soppy but it did...how wud u feel if ur best friend for years just moved to the other side of the world.  Then u only seeing her once every 2 years if your lucky.  We did everything together! We had this little plan we did every weekend.  On friday she used to come and sleep at my house, then on saturday lucy and han used to stay the day then i went to Hanisa's house to sleep then EVERY sunday we went bowling.  We were soo close.  We talked about everything...i could tell her anything and knowing that she wouldnt tell anyone.  I feel i cant trust many people. When they break my trust it takes ages to trust them again.  People think im a push over...well im not! 

Kaz and Kaylz:>4 u!
I know i get jealous of u guys its just whenever i see you guys together it reminds me of me and hanisa.  I kno u think im being nasty...im not! Its just i miss her sooo much.  This sounds soo soppy but im realli depressed and i dont know what to do with myself.

Im trying to look into the future - with ma exams and that but i can hardly concentrate with me being depressed.  I try to block everything out...but it just gets me more depressed when everythins lurking in the back of ma mind!

Luv ya

i doubt i will actually start using this site again.  who knows.  i frequent myspace, that's about it.  a lot has happened since i last wrote in here... my daughter is 4 1/2 now!!!!!!!!  maybe sometime in the next week or so i will write a real update.  maybe!"

anyway, first paul drove me and lily to my moms so lily could trick-or-treat there, then we drove to diane's and we all went to some ritzy development in wrentham.  we didn't go to too many houses cause lily was over-tired and was really heavy to carry around up these people's long ass driveways.  i stopped at my mom's house again on the way home but lily was sound asleep by then.  i've stolen most of her kit-kats, poor baby."

"event","sunday i worked 10-5 then went to shayne's wake afterwards with my mom and my sister nat in her national guard uniform.  it was packed.  like at all wakes, they post lots of pictures of the person who died.. it was so weird looking at pictures of him holding huge guns.  of course they had all the pictures of him from when he was a younger kid, that's how i'll always remember him cause i was around him a lot more around elementary school than anything.  i could never join the military, they had a two marines standing on each side of his casket and they have to stand their so stiff with no expression while all these people are around them bawling their eyes out.  i ran into katie baker and lily harris and jamie smith and i can't remember who else at the wake.  i hate how thats the only place i ever seem to run into people.. at funerals.

yesterday i was supposed to work 10-5 but shayne's funeral was at 10 so i went to that instead.  it was in a tiny church and i ended up having to stand the whole time cause there was no where to sit.  governor mitt romney was there, but i didn't see president bush anywhere.  he should be required to go to every military funeral.  my mom dropped me off but luckily i ran into katie so i wasn't by myself.  shayne's brother justin and his sister brandy both went up to talk and it was so friggen sad.  i can't imagine losing a sibling... but i really really can't imagine losing my child.  i feel so bad for his mother :(

i got a ride with katie and christina and catherine to the burial in attleboro.  he was buried where i guess my great-grandparents and a bunch of my great-aunts and uncles are also buried.  the funeral procession was SOOOO long.  we caused so many traffic jams with all the cars going to the burial on the highway.  military burials are pretty sad, when they start singing amazing grace or whatever the hell it was.  the 21 gun salute thing scared the shit out of everyone though haha.  i saw danielle scalia there and i wanted to go say hi but at that time and place it just didn't seem right i guess, though now i regret not doing so ><.  i think the worse part was when shayne's mom was saying goodbye to him one last time and she was sitting their kneeled down at his casket which was over where it was going to be lowered into, and she started singing baby lullabies to him.  once again, i put myself in her shoes for a second there and if i lost my lily, i don't know what i'd do.

the funeral (well ""coverage"") was on channel 5 news last night.  i only caught the end cause my mom called me to tell me it was on.

all i can say now is nobody else better die anytime soon, i am really sick of funerals."

"event","shayne cabino passed away.  i'm so sick of people my age dying.  he died serving in the marines over in iraq.  i've known shayne since elementary school, he lived down the street from me on union st.  i can't imagine how his mother must have felt when they came to her door to tell her the news.  here's the obituary(i fixed some of their spelling errors cause it drove me nuts) :

""Shayne M. Cabino

Friday, October 14, 2005

FRANKLIN -- Lance Cpl. Shayne Matthew Cabino, 19, a longtime Franklin resident and most recently a resident of Canton, died Thursday, Oct. 6, 2005, in Karmah, Iraq, outside Fallujah, when an improvised explosive device detonated. 
 
Born in Milford, a son of William J. Cabino Sr. of Canton and Jodi L. (Meunier) Cabino-Cipriano. He was educated in Franklin schools and graduated in 2004 from Canton High School. 
 
While he attended Tri-County Regional Vocational Technical High School as a freshman, he was on the school's wrestling team and won a total of 10 matches and was a runner-up at the 2001 state vocational wrestling tournament. 
 
In Canton, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and from Franklin went to basic training at Parris Island, S.C. Upon completing basic training, he went to Camp Lejuene, N.C., where he was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, as a mortarman who was responsible for operating an 81mm mortar. The unit, whose motto is ""Second to None,"" was sent to Iraq earlier this year. 
 
His unit was responsible for working alongside the Iraqi security forces to deny insurgents access to and from developing strongholds around the city of Fallujah. 
 
He was awarded the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal. He also received the Purple Heart posthumously. 
 
He loved saltwater fishing, riding dirt bikes and Maine. He lived life to the fullest and was a loyal friend and always lit up a room with his smile. He was extremely proud of the uniform he wore and the fact he was serving his country. 
 
Besides his parents, he leaves four brothers, Justin Cabino, William Cabino Jr. and Zachary Cipriano of Franklin, and Bobby Cabino of Canton; two sisters, Brandi Cabino-Navas of Florida and Melissa Cabino of Canton; his stepfather, Anthony Cipriano of Franklin; his stepmother, Mary Cabino of Canton; his maternal grandparents, Mark and Carol Mazelli of North Attleboro; his aunts and uncles, Robert Cabino, Jeanette Gonsalves, Susanne Perry, Heidi Reed, Holli Carter and Mark Mazelli; and his childhood friend, Jesse Rosetti of Franklin.

He was the grandson of the late Alfred Barber and Mary Cabino and nephew of the late Anthony Cabino and Todd Vinton. 
 
A funeral with full military honors will be held Monday, Oct. 17, at 10 a.m., at St. John's Episcopal Church, 237 Pleasant St., officiated by the Rev. John Sullivan of the Tri-County Full Gospel Church. 
 
Burial will follow in Mount Hope Cemetery, Attleboro Falls. 
 
Calling hours will be Sunday, Oct. 16, from 2 to 8 p.m., at the Charles F. Oteri and Son Franklin Funeral Home, 33 Cottage St.""


funeral's going to be awkward, as all funerals are for people this young, i know i'm going to see a lot of old faces.. my mom will be going because she used to be friends with his mom when we were in elementary school, and my older sister will be going because she's in the national guard so it's sort of out of respect for her to go, but man.. that really, really sucks.  fuck you, president bush.  let's see you send your kids to iraq."

"event","funeral/burial was today, wake was last night.  hmm i'm pretty sure when we went to the burial (which was at the cemetery but inside some really small thing), they were digging her grave while we were there.  not cool.  it was interesting seeing all of my dad's side of the family again, i used to spend a lot of time with them when i was younger.

my grandmother had 10 kids (1 being my dad), 25 grandkids (6 being me and my sisters/brothers), and 28 great-grandkids (1 being my daughter).  i'm happy with the memories i have of her, the ones that stick out the most are her and my grandfather sitting at their table EVERY time i was over there, always looking really happy, and me, britt, and nat sitting on the bench facing the table.. and her giving us generic barbie dolls haha.  she was a very sweet woman, and she will be missed."

umm.. me, paul, diane, chris, and christiana took a metal three-seater boat into the middle of the lake there where paul, diane and chris decided to jump off and swim, and then it started thundering haha.  it was pretty funny.  umm we made smores, yum.. actually i'm the only one who actually ate a smore.. well i had like three but shh.  hmm so yeah, new hampshire was fun, i love new hampshire.

speaking of which, sarah do you remember my i love new hampshire bear with the shirt that said that?  haha.

i called my gyno today and told them i wanna switch from the shot to an IUD.  depending which one they give me, that lasts for 5+ years.  at first they told me i couldn't cause i was too young to make that choice but i told them ""um i'm 19 and i had a baby a year ago and i really don't want to have another anytime in the next.. well, many many years, if ever"" so they agreed to let me get it haha.  it's just some thing they stick in your uterus [oh that should be fun].  least i won't have to go there every 3 months for the shot anymore... although i dunno, i'm kinda still undecided between the two.

"event","well it's all over now.  the wake was last night and the funeral was today.  there were quite a few people at the wake, i didn't recognize some of them but it turns out some of my mom/aunt's friends from waay back came and a bunch of my grandmother's old friends as well.  i was happy to see my old neighbor mrs. walsh there.. she's older than my grandmother was :/ she's the sweetest lady ever though.  i didn't like the fact that my great aunts/uncles weren't considered ""immediate family"" even though they were her brothers and sisters though.. i dunno.  we were in the immediate family seats where everyone comes over and shakes your hand and tells you their sorry for your loss, etc. which was a little depressing but it was nice to see all these people that have been a part of my grandmother's life for so long.  i lived with my grandmother for just about 17 years before she got put in a nursing home.  that woman deserves a lot of credit for all the things she has done in her life.  i wish i had the chance to take back some of the asshole things i did as a kid.  she was pretty much my ""other"" mom.  i even have memories of her potty-training me ... haha.

the funeral was a little harder on me than the wake. first we gathered at the funeral home and said our final goodbyes, then we headed to the church.  my grandmother had 7 grandkids so six of them were the pall-bearers [not me :-/] and i had to put the pall over the casket inside the church.  i think what got me the worst was my mom's eulogy.. that's when i lost it.  i forgot tissues, what kind of person forgets to bring tissues to a funeral??? heh. anyway, after that was the burial.  we didn't stay long enough to watch them lower the casket into the ground.. been there and done that before and it is not fun.  the reception was quick, well i don't know how long everyone stayed but i didn't for too long cause it was just little cakes and stuff and i needed something real to eat :-/  and i'm all typed out for now sooo.."

"event","my grandmother passed away this evening.  if you read the last entry from easter, you'll know i knew it was coming though.  she would have turned 86 next month.  alzheimers is a pretty crappy thing.

well let's start from the beginning.  thursday night the nursing home my grandmother was in called my mom.  no one answered, and my mom didn't get the message til friday after having her foot surgery.  they were calling to let her know that my grandmother's condition was not very good.  saturday morning i called my mom to see how her foot surgery went, and she told me ""good, but memere [that's what i call my grandmother] is dying.""  lovely.

as soon as nat got out of work saturday she picked me up and we went to go see memere.  she was pretty much in a coma state, and wasn't reacting to anything.  the nurses would change her position every couple hours and give her a shot containing morphine, but she wouldn't flitch or change her face or open her eyes or anything.  we stayed til late and the nurses told us they expected her to die either that night or the next morning.

so sunday morning rolls around.  we head to the nursing home and she was pretty much the same.  not to gross you out, but her feet had started to turn purple from her circulatory system beginning to shut down.  however, she still had a strong heart beat and her respirations were good... even though she sounded and appeared to be gasping for breath.  my grandmother had said a long time ago when she was ok that she did not want any sort of life support if she was in a situation like this.  so all they were doing was injecting her with morphine to make her death painless and they had a little oxygen blowing into her nose, but it wasn't breathing for her, she was doing that by herself.  anyway, night came around and she was still hanging on.  everyone said it would be definitely be that night that she would go.. but wait!

this morning [monday] i looked at my phone and i had like 17 missed calls or something.  i had forgotten to take it off silent so i missed my mom and sisters calling me over and over.  the nursing home had called my mom this morning and told her to get down there cause it wouldn't be much longer.  so by the time i woke up everyone was already there, but my brothers picked me up.  her condition hadn't changed much other than her legs starting to turn purple.  as today progressed it kept getting just a little bit worse.  all day long my mom kept saying 5:30 p.m. would be when she passed away.  at about quarter past 5 my mom convinced me finally to walk to the pizza place next door with britt to get something to eat because the nurses brought everyone turkey sandwiches and britt and i wouldn't eat them.  all day my mom had been telling me to go get something to eat, so i finally gave in around 5:15.  i got to the pizza place and ordered my food and called paul to let him know we were still waiting.  britt and i joked at 5:25 ""oh we have to hurry, we only have five minutes"" since my mom kept saying my grandmother would go at 5:30.  then my food was ready, i sat down with my food, looked at my phone and saw three missed calls and a voice message.  the message was my brother saying ""GET HERE NOW"".  britt and i ran up to the counter and told the guy to wrap up the food cause it was an emergency, then we literally ran to the nursing home and got up to my grandmother's room to see everyone crying.  sure enough.. she passed away while we were at the pizza place.  i was so devastated.  i really wanted to be there with her when she went.  we didn't stick around much longer obviously, since the funeral guys were on their way to get her.

all i can say is it has been one hell of a past few days.  i lived with my grandmother for just about 17 years.  according to my mom and everyone that was in the room when she went, she opened her eyes just before dying and looked up and started moving her mouth, as if talking, then that was it.  i don't know what happens when you die, really no one does, but my mom is sure her dad [my grandmother's husband who died 35 years ago] came for her.  who knows.

rest in peace, memere."

me, my sister nat, my brother jeff, and lily headed to north attleboro to see my grandmother.  i don't think i had seen her since thanksgiving.  every time i see her, she is worse than the previous.  she suffers from alzheimers, and the second i saw her sunday i could tell there was no life left in her.  she did not say a word the whole time we were there, nor did she show any sort of emotion whatsoever.  every once and a while she stuck out her hand a little bit, kind of like she was trying to say something but it just wouldn't come out.  her eyes kept closing and it was so clear that she just doesn't have the energy to live anymore.  it was so hard for me not to burst into tears.  i lived with her for just about seventeen years.  as a kid i said so many awful things to her even though she was basically my other mom.  it was odd though, she was staring off blankly most of the time we were there, but her eyes caught lily for a moment and you could see her try to crack a smile.  the last time we were there, she was showing emotions a bit more and all she wanted to do was hold lily and talk to lily, even if it made no sense what she was saying.  it's nice to know lily at least got to meet her great-grandmother.  i don't know how much longer she's going to be around, but i really don't want to remember her as being the way she was when i saw her sunday.

alright i'm bringing myself down :/  in any case, the baby's doing well.. she's sick right now but so am i.  still only has her two bottom front teeth.  hmm she loves cheerios.. she wants to walk on her own badly.. she walks holding onto things though.  umm she babbles a lot.. aw she's so great.  :)"

after that, i got dropped off at paul's sister diane's.  i watched paul play with lincoln logs, and lily try to eat them.. and then we ate.  i didn't stay too long though cause i had to get to my mom's too.  paul dropped me off there.  i sat at the table with my mom, dad, and britt.. the conversations we had weren't too appropriate for ""table talk"" or whatever haha, mostly britt complaining about how my mom doesn't trust her, and my mom talking about her friend having conjunctivitis, and my dad talking about his sister's dog getting hit by a car.. hrm.  haha.  lily had fun harassing the doggies.... and yeah, i just don't feel like typing much more."

um.  on the 13th nat arrived home, finally, from her national guard bootcamp thing that she's been at [in missouri] since early in the summer.  we had a ""surprise"" welcome-home party for her the next day.  hrm.. my mom, dad, their friend debbie, my brother jeff, my brother dave, his wife sonja, my sister britt, my cousin chris, his girlfriend [insert name here?], my aunt terry, my uncle jim, me, lily, and obviously nat were there.  i hadn't seen chris since my brother's wedding.. which was quite a while ago.  we had lots of food, food is nice, and we watched some video thing they get sent home with.  it showed them going into the gas chambers and having to take off their masks.. and screaming with pain and puking their brains out in there.. lovely. ..amongst all sorts of other stuff they have to do, which i could NEVER do.

a few days ago was the 2 year anniversary of timmy passing away.  no good.  i miss that bastard.  grr.

work sucks.  i don't think i'll ever find a job i really like.  not unless i ever get a real job, which is never going to happen.  and even then..

heh.  enough complaining.  yesterday i started christmas shopping.  i didn't get too far with that.  i had a decent amount of money when i started out, but i spent every sent... and barely bought anything?  we went to toy works in franklin first.. which is closing.. which is nuts!  i talked to mike just long enough to make fun of kb toys, then i bought my neices christmas presents.  i thought about what i bought them afterwards and realized i shouldn't have gotten them that.  ""all sales are final"" says the lady at the register. >:o  then me, nat, and my dad headed elsewhere.  i bought dave and sonja a drinking game, and i spent the rest of my money on paul.  if i'm lucky, he'll like what i got him, if not.. too bad >:o heh.  i haven't even gotten around to buying him what i want to though.  so in conclusion, i spent all my money and haven't finished buying stuff for even one person yet.  i have a huge family, so this is going to be a difficult task!

and yeah, that's all.  i have to work 5-9:30 tonight.. aside from mondays, i'm only working closing shifts from now on.  the end."

sooo i was supposed to work 'til five today, my boss let me leave at 2 though cause the outlets weren't as packed as they usually are.  tomorrow's halloween, i need to figure out what's going on, if anything.. gotta talk to paul and sarah.  

hrm.  my sister's coming home from her national guard bootcamp crap that she's been at since the beginning of july in about two weeks, yippy!  i think i've probably said that a few times already though.

right now i'm trying to distract myself from devouring all this chocolate at once.  sooo gooood.  i love the little diagram of all the chocolates inside the box, but it makes it so hard to pick just which one to eat!!  ahh now i'm thirsty.  anywho, i'm going to wait for lily to wake up now.  goood bye."

yeah, so, lily started solids as i've mentioned.  so far, she's had.. rice cereal, chiquita bananas, sweet potatoes, peas, and carrots.  next up is either green beans or squash.. lucky her!"

after work yesterday, me and paul went grocery shopping.  we spent $114.19.  hopefully i can get to star market today 'cause we're almost out of milk annnnd i need to pick up some more formula.  we discovered shaws in franklin [where we went yesterday] is definitely more expensive than star market in medway [where we normally go].  for example.. celeste pizzas at star market in medway are a buck, and at shaws in franklin they are $1.99.  a gallon of shaws water at star is 50 cents, and at shaws is 75 cents.  pssh.

so after that we went home and it was like 6:30.  we had started to watch die hard 3 the other day, so we finished that and then watched space jam.  then we went to bed, then paul got up at 4:30 for work :-( thennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn the baby woke me up for good around 7:30 and i fed her and i'm typing a nice run-on sentence and here i am.  i'm going to stick the baby in the thingie hanging in the doorway now so she can bounce around.  i love paul, the end."

"event","alright.. sooo.  me, paul, annette, and kevin went to maine this weekend.  here's how that went...

thursday, the van we were driving up to maine with had to get dropped off at some auto place to get the brakes fixed.  it wasn't done until sometime after 1 p.m. on friday.  eventually we left to go up there and BAM, traffic traffic traffic.  FINALLLLLLY we got off the highway and went to find the hotel... hrm.  we drove past it and had to turn around in some dark alley =-O we were staying at the hilton garden inn.. classy.  i felt so out of place walking in there haha.  everyone in there were all these older adults in their suits and what-not.  but the room was nice, etc. etc. so yeah, we dropped our crap off in the room and it was already like 8:30 p.m. :-/ definitely needed to eat though sooooo we went downstairs for dinner!  we were the only people eating in the dining area but there were these older business-like people over near us by the fireplace getting traaaashed.  paul was like ""i feel like we're two old couples sitting near a bunch of teenagers >:o"" hehe.  i had some chicken fingers and french fries and then it was back upstairs we go.  after we ate, me and annette went back up to the hotel room and paul and kevin went to go find themselves a packy store haha.  we watched comedy central for a bit and thennnn we went to bed.  in the morning, we went downstairs to the breakfast buffet... MMM.  oh man i ate so much haha.  i had like... scrambled eggs, homefries, french toast, lucky charms, and a couple mini-pancakes.  and cocoa!  heh.  numnums.  blah blah blah, we headed out to go find the speedway to go to the bike show we were up there to see.  it was pouring... it had been the whole time we were up there.  we stopped at various places to ask for directions..... people in maine are soooo stupid.  they were all saying like ""oh ten minutes down the road.""  YEAAAAAAAAAH okay... heh.  one person sent us down some dead end street.. :-/  but eventually we got to the speedway and they said the show was postponed 'til one... so we went to a near-by pawn shop =-O heh.  and then to a fleamarket.  i bought paul a sword!  now he has two.  yada yada, we went back to the speedway and they said the show was postponed until TOMORROW... uhhh.. we were going home that night so... >:o  :-/  we ended up finding the freeport outlets and going there... but the layout sucks and it was pouring.. they're not like the wrentham outlets were you can be under a roof thingie... they're spread out over different streets and crap.  we went into maidenform so annette could see if some girl she knows was working and then we went upstairs to yankee candle.  i spent about $75 there haha.  thennn we left there and went to carter's to get lily something.  there was the BEST outfit ever there, it said ""if you think I'M cute, you should see my daddy"" haha i wanted to buy it sooo bad, i have no idea why i didn't.. i love embarassing paul :-) i ended up getting a sleeper that says ""daddy's little girl"" on it though.  kkkkkkkk then after that i think we headed home.  yep.  the highway was interesting.  paul drove about 90 mph the entire way back.  it took us 3 1/2 hours, almost 4 i think to get up to maine, it only took us 2 1/2.. actually, i think a little less, to get home haha.  eww some guy drove a dead bear back to massachusetts from maine, we kept passing him.  OH and i forgot, we drove through poland spring, maine a couple times :-) yep yep.  it was nice to go away for a day or two, despite the rain and all that.  overall, i had fun :-)

i'm sick :-( but i have today off from work, woooo.

  Well this is Paul.
Hollie is getting ready for work, she's slow doing that stuff. The Manager of the store she works at wanted her to work 1:00 to 9:30 but she didn't want to, she was originally going to work from 5:00 to 9:30 but they ended up getting a delivery in they didn't know about. So now she's working 3:00 to 9:30, etc.
  Hollie bought Final Fantasy IX, so now we have FF IIV, FF IIX FF IX FF X and FFX2, although she rarely plays any of them. She needs me to brush her hair, BY THE WAY! because she can't do it herself. The baby got 4 shots on tuesday. she was really tired yesterday, and wasn't as hungry as usual. I guess she didn't like the shots... Who would? I would have been there with hollie, but i had an appointment pending that i had to attend.

  Anyways, I have to brush Hollie's hair so she can get ready for work... And so i can as well. Plus Baby Looney Toons is on, and that show is the shizat. Because they're cute. I have to drive Hollie to work at 2:40, it takes approximately 17 minutes to get to the wretham outlets from my house in medway.

   Have fun reading. 
     Goodbye,

OKAY enough of the corny-ness.  umm.  i'm hanging out with lily right now.  i was planning on seeing if sarah was around but i let the boy go out instead.  star market in medway has elios pizza 2 for 3 bucks right now so i totaaaaaally picked some of that up tonight.  as well as edy's ice cream [the best] on sale, and general mills cereal on sale.. and vitamins on sale.. so i had a good time grocery shopping this evening!  that's about it.  i have to work 10-5 tomorrow.  fun fun fun."

anywho, from there i started looking for places that are hiring.  i went into harry & david but they were out of applications and told me to try back in a couple days.  next i went into striderite... ..and pretty much got hired.  the guy working told me i looked familiar, i told him i used to work at kb toys and i actually remember him coming in there a bunch of times.  i filled out the application and he asked me if i had applied anywhere else yet.. i said no, and he said good, don't... soooo.. yeah.  he also told me i had perfect timing, yada yada, and that gary [i'm guessing the store manager] would call me tomorrow.  well then.  hopefully that works out, the only thing that sucks is he said they aren't big on giving out vacation days.. blah.  but they've got plenty of hours to give out, unlike kb toys.  yeep.

after that, we went back to diane's and got pizzaaaa.  we played yahtzee.. i won once!  woo!  and that's about it.  now i'm just waiting for paul to come home from fishing annnnd i've got to get lily to bed.

ohhh and one more thing.. we saw this girl with the HUGEST ass at the outlets.  like.. she was this skinny girl.. with a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE butt.  HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE.  i guess diane spotted her first, it was wicked funny.. she saw her and immediately said ""OH. MY. GOD. BECKY.  LOOK. AT. HER. BUTT.""  :-x haha.  oh and i forgot we went to the fudgery after that.. i got ice cream, but the fudge was sooooo temptinggggggggg.  okay, now i'm done."

i woke up around 5:30 a.m. thursday [may 6th] morning cause i had to peeeee.  so i pee'd.  heh.  thennn i layed back down, but i was feeling kind of ""ehhh"" so i didn't manage to fall back asleep.  around 7:30 i had to pee again [yes, one of the many joys of pregnancy], so i went in the bathroom and discovered i was bleeding.. eeee.  sooo i tried not to freak out and i went and told paul's mom and then i called the doctor.  she said it was normal to bleed a little while your cervix effaces and dilates but i assured her it was a little more than ""a little"" :-/ plus i was having minor contractions so she had me go to the hospital.  i woke up paul, called my mom, got changed, yada yada, anddd it was off to the hospital we went!

the car ride consisted of me, paul, and his mom.. however, my mom ended up being in front of us [even though she was coming from walpole and we were coming from medway], and paul's sister diane was driving behind us [she was coming from wrentham].  heh.  my dad was already at the hospital when we got there, so the bunch of us headed in.  everyone but me and paul got sent into a waiting room and we went into what turned out to be the room i was stuck in thursday, friday, and saturday.  some bitchy nurse [sorry] hooked me up to some thingie to monitor my contractions and the baby's heartbeat and asked me 98032598203985 questions and all that fun stuff.  paul looked like he was going to pass out alreaddddy.  after they told me a bunch of times that i may get sent home, they decided they'd keep me and it looked as though i would be having my baaaaby!

dumdedum.  i was hooked up to an IV to give me fluids to stay hydrated, and another to give me medication, eventually i wanted some sort of pain medication so they hooked that up.  unfortunately, all that did was knock me out.  it was pretty funny though.. paul's sitting there filling out the birth certificate and he's asking me things and i was just completely out of it.  i tried reading it but it was just one huge blur and then bam, i fell asleep.  sadly, i woke up to [not sure which time that i woke up, i think i fell asleep/woke up several times] some really, REALLY painful contractions.. apparently, whatever they hooked me up to sucked, and it ended up making me throw up.  yippy.  i told them i wanted the epidural riiiiight now, and ohhhh i got it.  NO FUN.  the crap they had been giving me made me so drowsy that i could literally not get myself to sit up.  in addition to that, i was in so much pain that i was REALLY cranky and paul's sitting in front of me trying to help me out and i was just all GRRRR.  then the doctor was getting kind of impatient cause i couldn't stay still [i was falling over, haha], blah blah blah, in short:  epidurals HURT!  ouch.  i guess i fell asleep again, cause i remember waking up feeling better.  bye bye painful contractions :-)  the doctor decided to break my water..... ugh.  i'm just glad that didn't happen while i was at home or something, yuck.

hrm.  eventually, out of nowhere [i guess] i felt like the baby was on her way out, so i let the nurse know that it was time.  i SWEAR the epidural was wearing off somehow though haha.  but anyway, yes.. yes it was time.  a painful time.  very painful.  very very.  luckily i was only pushing for like half an hour.  as soon as i started to, the nurse was like ""ooo she's got a full head of hair!""  yeep.  so after killing myself with that, my wee-one was born and paul cut the cord and they kidnapped her to clean her and all that and i had to get stitches and that hurt kajs;ghaghj;dfjka'sgh'.

anyway, we named her lily ann guglielmi.  her birthweight was 6 pounds, 14 ounces annnd she was born at 6:08 p.m. [a nice, all-day-long labor..!], annnd she measured out to 19 and 3/4 inches!

i had lots and lots of visitors right after that, but after everyone left it was discovered that i was bleeding WAY too much and i had a huge blood clot and they told me they were probably going to be doing surgery on me that night or in the morning.. never happened though but that sucked.  i think i need to call the doctor though cause i'm in a lot of pain still/again, booooo.  k, i'm tired of typing."

umumum.  i went to raynham flea market today.  yeep.  bought the baby a bib that says ""new kid on the block"" ;-) haha.

yada yada yada, i have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning... i have one every week now.. i'm due in four weeks and two days.. eeeeee.  k i'm done, i dunno why but writing in this thing feels awkward.. like i'm talking to myself or something, heh."

"event","haha, wow.. i'm trying to figure out exactly when i want my last day of work to be so i was reading up on when preggos should leave their job.... apparently studies have shown that women who are 28 weeks pregnant or more [i'm 34 weeks] whose jobs are stressful and/or require long periods of standing [mine's very stressful {damn foreigners} and i stand the whole time] have a higher risk of complications like premature labor, high blood pressure, and low birthweight in the baby.  and oh geez... ""The American Medical Association recommends that women who work at jobs requiring more than four hours in a row a day on their feet should take a leave of absence by the 24th week, and that those who must stand for thirty minutes out of each hour should take a leave by the 32nd.""  four hours, ha... i was standing for 7 1/2 hours straight [well, with one break that was less than 20 minutes long somewhere in between] on sunday. and there's more.  ""it's probably a good idea to take early leave from a job that requires frequent shift changes."" ..that's mine.  so uh... according to the american medical association, i should have left my job ten weeks ago.  heh.  whoops?  i was planning to work up to may 1st [i'd be almost 37 weeks!], but i'm going to talk to my manager and see if the end of next week is alright.  work's really been killing me lately anyway.  k, i'm done."

"event","boo.  i'm 34 weeks pregnant today.. which means i'm due in six weeks.. which means i could easily have this kid in like four weeks..... AHHHHHHH.  i can't wait to not be pregnant anymore though, it's killing me.  umm.  i'm wicked stressed out, not even so much just about that, just a ton of other shit but i don't feel like rambling about it.  so on that note, here, let me entertain myself:


Week 34

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Baby: Your baby measures about 19.8 inches from head to toe and weighs about 5 pounds. Baby is probably settling into the head-down position, although it might not be final. Organs are now almost fully mature, except for lungs, and the skin is pink instead of red. Fingernails reach the ends of fingers, but toenails are not yet fully grown. Baby might have lots of hair. Movements are less frequent because of the tight fit. 
 
Mom-to-be: Your uterus hardens and contracts as practice for labor, known as Braxton Hicks contractions, but you may not feel them yet. Your pelvis has expanded and may ache, especially at the back. Uterus is pushed hard against your lower ribs and your rib cage may be sore, and your navel is probably pushing out as a result of your abdomen being stretched. 



alright.  the ""tight fit"" part is right, the baby's lacking room but that is NOT stopping her from moving and it hurts, especially my ribs.  and yes, my back is killing me beyond belief.  eeeeee."

"event","weeeeeeell well well.  it's been a while!  i can't believe it's already mid-march =-O i'm popping out a kid at the end of may!  ayeyeyeyeyeyeye.  i'm going to be 30 weeks pregnant on tuesday, yikes.  hmmmmmm.  i don't really feel like sitting on the computer sooo i'll wrap this up with these thingies.

Week 29

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Baby: Your baby measures about 10.4 inches from crown to rump, or a total length of about 16.7 inches from head to toe, and weighs about 2.7 pounds. At this stage a fetus's eyes are almost always blue and can distinguish bright sunlight or artificial light through the uterine wall. Baby is performing fewer acrobatics as conditions in the womb become more cramped, but still doing a lot of kicking and stretching. 
 
Mom-to-be: Your uterus is about 3.5 to 4 inches above your navel. Weight gain is probably between 19 and 25 pounds. As odds improve that baby could survive outside the womb -- although in a neonatal intensive-care unit -- you may be feeling relieved and excited, or anxious about motherhood, your baby's health, and labor and delivery. If you do experience premature labor, signs include menstrual-like cramps or lower back pain, a trickle of amniotic fluid, or a watery pinkish or brownish discharge preceded sometimes by the passage of a thick, gelatinous mucus plug. Your practitioner often can stop labor from progressing with bed rest, muscle relaxants or other drugs, possibly requiring hospitalization. 


yum.  my mommy went into labor when she was 5 1/2 months pregnant with my sister nat [i'm just about 7 months] but they stopped it.. it was because she was so stressed out and such cause of the jerk she was with [dave/jeff/nat's dad].  he did some pretty shitty stuff to her.  fuckface.  heh, sorry.  k, and 30 weeks-


Week 30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Baby: Your baby measures about 17 inches from head to toe and weighs about 3 pounds. Baby is growing plumper and beginning to control its own body temperature. Eyebrows and eyelashes are fully developed, and hair on the head is getting thicker. Head and body are now proportioned like a newborn's. Hands are now fully formed and fingernails are growing.
 
Mom-to-be: Your uterus is about four inches above your navel, and it's hard to believe you still have about 10 weeks to go as baby continues to push on your ribs. You may be feeling more discomfort in your pelvis and abdomen. You'll probably be gaining about a pound a week. 

and for the hell of it:

Week 31

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Baby: Your baby measures about 18 inches long from head to toe and weighs about 3.5 pounds. Rather than hearing vibrations, baby's nerve endings in his ears are connected now so that he can hear distinct sounds, like familiar voices and music. 
 
Mom-to-be: Your uterus now fills a large part of your abdomen, and you've probably gained between 21 and 27 pounds. You're probably feeling increasing excitement and anxiousness about the birth -- it won't be long now.


=-O alrighty, i'm going to go watch tvvvvvvv.  crystal, if you read this, give me a call.  leeeeeave a message if i don't answer it too so i can get back to youuuu."

"event","sooo.  had one of my million doctor's appointments today.  my next is in three weeks.. i used to go every four, but after my next i go every two weeks.. then every week.. then POP! goes the baby.  ha, i wish it was that easy.

i feel so out of place sitting in the waiting room with all the other preggos.  they're all like 30+ and i'm.. well.. 18.  i can just imagine what they think every time they see me.  :-/

my appointments, generally speaking, tend to be pretty routine.  i go in, pee in a cup, get my blood pressure taken, get weighed, go into the room, wait for the doctor, get my belly measured, have the baby's heart-rate checked, get asked a bunch of questions and can ask whatever.  the doctor told me i've finally started gaining weight and i'm right where i should be with that, as well as right where i should be with how i measured.  she told me the glucose test went fine [meaning.. i don't have diabetes] and my blood pressure's great, as usual, and everything's going fine EXCEPT.. they discovered i'm anemic.  i'm lacking in the iron department and she told me i'm probably not eating enough red meat.. haha, i decided against telling her the only red meat i've ever had are hot dogs [they're red meat right?  haha].. and i haven't had a hot dog in about nine years or so? :-X !  anyway, she suggested some iron supplement i should get [which i later checked out and i can't take it cause i can't swallow pills so i'm just going to have to double my flintstones vitamins like i should have been to begin with].  i'm going to try to start eating scrambled eggs since that's the only thing i can think of that i like that will up my iron in-take.  yeep.  the doctor told me i need to pick a pediatrician soooon, eee.  she wanted to know if i'm going to take any classes.. i really don't think i'd be comfortable in any.  if i take the normal ones, i'll be with all these older women and feel like i do when i sit around them in the waiting room.  if i take the ones they have for teens, i'll be around all these 14 year olds with their crack babies [sorry, sorry].  i dunno.  it's all reallllly overwhelming.  a;sldkfj tomorrow i'm 27 weeks pregnant, and in 2 days i'm 6 months. 'tis scary.  very, verrrrrrrry scary.  i'm sure everything will work out in the end, i know it's going to be reallllll tough but everything will be okay.

dododo.  my mom bought me the lion king 1 1/2.  she really shouldn't have but she insissssssssts.  she also bought more and more baby stuff, including clothes, diapers, binkies! heh, yada yada.  she's nuts.  she's so funny though.  she was brought up by a really strict catholic mom and was taught premarital sex is bad and is all against it and shit, so she told me i should buy a gold ring and wear it on my ring finger so ""it won't look so bad"".  haha.  that's horrible.

hrm.  so.. work is still being stupid with hours.  i really wish i could get another job.  :-/

this show is kind of amusing.  fox comes up with the lamest things, heh.  blah blah blah.  paul's sleeeeeeeping.  he's adorable :-D i love him to death.  i really really really do.  errr i want to squeeze him to death but i'll wake him up :-/ oh well :-( i'm going to wait for his mommy to finish making cupcakes, goood bye."

so.. hmm.  i could back-track to way back when i last updated [well, second to last update], but it's just a big wad of crap in between, so i'll start from yesterday?

yesterday i went to milford hospital for a glucose test.. testing for gestational diabetes or something.  the test consisted of me drinking a bottle of some sugary drink [tasted like orange soda], waiting an hour, and then getting blood drawn.  i've had my blood drawn so many damn times during this pregnancy.  i've taken every test possible though, even the optional ones.  ::burp::

anywho, my mom took me out after to get preggo people clothes since my stomach's huge now due to the fact that the baby's getting huge and i'm 26 weeks pregnant.... yeep.  'twas interesting.

ummm.. tomorrow sarah's supposed to take me to get my permit, that should be interesting.  i'm going to cry if i fail.  heh.  i'll end up failing the eye test like my sister did. :-X

alrighty... i'll leave you with this:

Week 26

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Baby-to-be: Your baby measures about 9.2 inches from crown to rump and weighs almost 2 pounds now. Its hearing is fully developed. As the fetus reacts to sounds, its pulse increases. Your baby will even move in rhythm to music. Lungs are still growing but are not yet mature. Patterns of your baby's brain waves appear like a full-term newborn. It also has patterns of sleeping and waking. 
 
Mom-to-be: The baby's constant movements should be reassuring. You'll be putting on weight at the rate of about 1 pound per week now. You may be feeling some rib pain as your baby grows and pushes upward on your rib cage. The pressure may also be causing indigestion and heartburn. You may even be feeling stitch-like pains down the sides of your abdomen as your uterine muscle stretches."

in other neeeeeeews.  tuesday i'll be 24 weeks pregnant, yikes.  here's some info to go with that-

Week 24

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Baby: Your baby, now about in its 22nd week of development, is 8.4 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 1.2 pounds. It is starting to produce white blood cells, mostly for combating disease and infection, and may respond to your touch or sounds. If you haven't felt hiccups yet, you might feel some jerking motion now. 
 
Mom-to-be: Your uterus is about 1.5 to 2 inches above your navel. Expect to gain about a pound per week this month. Glucose screens for detecting gestational diabetes are given between this week and 28 weeks. 
 
Tip for the Week: 
Dad-to-be might be able to hear the baby's heartbeat by putting his ear to your abdomen. 


yiiikes.  i get to go for that diabetes testing thingie soon, that should be interesting.. they give me some really sugary thing to drink and i have to sit around for an hour and then go pee?  heh.  k.. back to stuffing my face."

Week 20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Baby: The fetus measures about 5.6 to 6.4 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 9 ounces. Your baby can hear sounds by now -- your voice, heart and your stomach growling, as well as sounds outside your body. It will cover its ears with its hands if a loud sound is made near you, and it may even become startled and ""jump."" The baby is moving often, too -- twisting, turning, wiggling, punching and kicking. 
 
Mom-to-be: Congratulations! You're at about the midpoint of your pregnancy. Your uterus is just about even with your navel. Your waistline has pretty much disappeared, but only temporarily! The risk of bladder infections increases because the smooth muscles in the urinary tract relax. Your breathing will become deeper and you may perspire more than usual from a more active thyroid gland. 
 
Tip for the Week: 
To alleviate backaches, maintain good posture. Sit with a footstool or use an ergonomic chair at the office, avoid standing for too long, sleep with a small pillow under your side at the waist, and lift things with your legs instead of your back. 


^^ well, the ""baby"" part is cute?  heh.  nine ounces.. pssh, when i went for my ultrasound on the 2nd the doctor said the baby weighs 11 ounces =-O


Week 21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Baby: Your baby measures about 7.2 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 10.5 ounces. The fetus is steadily gaining fat to keep warm. Growth rate is slowing down but organ systems, like digestion, are continuing to mature. A waxy film, called the vernix caseosa, is being produced by your baby's oil glands and covers the skin to keep it supple in the amniotic fluid. Buds for permanent teeth are beginning to form. 
 
Mom-to-be: Friends, relatives, even strangers can probably tell you're pregnant by now. Your uterus is starting to extend above your navel. You've probably gained between 10 and 14 pounds by now. 


fun stuff.  k, i'm done.  i love paul.  good bye."

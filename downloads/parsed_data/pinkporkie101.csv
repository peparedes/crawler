I am a huge supporter of lillians liberation theme for the summer. great idea. is it bad that i have no trouble admitting that my dad is my favorite. whatever. okay this week is hardcore diet beginning week. yuck. i think i need to go work out its a good stress reliever. i hate feeling fat and right now i feel like one of those blimps that fly over the big baseball games and advertise things like hotdogs and low cell phone cost. i haven't updated in forever but lately i have had absolutely no time. I need to get a job so if anybody knows of anything thats open i would love to hear about it. anyway i am going to drive to coffee loft now to apply. i hope ya'll have a great night. at least then someone will.

I cant really find any art work that makes me happy lately. It makes me sad. i so have so many things that i have yet to finish. We listened to disney songs in mrs. denton's room  today. it was so much fun. i loved it I forgot how many great songs disney had. Please no one tell julie i said that i will never hear the end of it :) I got the cutest bathing suit on sunday...now if i just had the body to wear it. oh well I'm working on it. It doesn't help that after bathing suit shopping i went home and pity-ate. Nothing makes you feel better than junk food. Until the next day but we dont talk about that. Sooo anyways i think i am supposed to be doing something for government but i think i am just going to wait and listen really well to the class dicussion tomorrow. you know i am getting alot out of that class i am already on like level 8 of my calculator game.

Not just like college and all that good stuff but like the still-high-school stuff. I mean i am so ready to get out of daphne high school just like everybody else but i love seeing everybody every day. Not to mention I am sssoooooo exicted about spring break. if anyone is ready to go to the beach I am. I am going to get a new bathing suit soon and i think i found the perfect one. Yay! I think Lisa Marie Presley wears to much eyeliner. Sorry random i know. Anyway. Mardi Gras starts this weekend. fun fun fun stuff. Mardi gras is almost my favorite holiday, second only to christmas. I love all my classes this semester. They are really a whole lot of fun. Even gov't...to some extent. I have learned a lot about myself this semester its definitely a learning experience. I hung out with brittany burchfield today. it was fun. she is really a positive person i miss hanging out with her. I think i am going to another rugby game this weekend. its really interesting to watch...well once i figured out what was going on :) but anyway. i am going to work out now. good night all.

"event","college day was fun. Alabama is a much bigger campus than i anticipated. ITS HUGE! I have just come to the conclusion that i am going to get lost the first like 3 weeks. I went to dogwood last night. i didnt really know any of the girls so the outcome didnt really bother me. Amy did really well and so did stacy davis. I really didn't pay all that much attention to the whole program honestly. i was really hungry. I went with Mrs. jennifer, jessica johnson, brittany burchfield, and lindsey robinson. It was ummm...interesting. I like Mrs. Jennifer and everything but my gosh she was so critical of everybody in the pageant. it was like in her eyes they didnt do anything right. maybe i just took it wrong or something, but come on people we're in daphne alabama your not going to get Miss America These girls arent supposed to be professionals I think they all did very well. They should all be so proud of themselves. I have so much government that i have put off that i need to do. I have to outline the chapter and i need to prepare a presentation on like the rise of federalism since like 17 something. yuck. My mom is mad at me because i didnt go to church this morning. oh well. okay well i need to go work out now. yay!

"event","okay i haven't really given anyone an insight into my head for a long time. so yea ya'll really wanna know what i'm thinking about...here it is. Those who say ""you catch more flies with honey than with vingear"" are retarded. Who the heck wants to catch flies they are so gross. I love flowers. they are the prettiest thing in nature. The main reason that i am such a ""goody-two shoes"" here is because 1.i am bound by reputation and 2.i dont want to disapoint my parents. I have learned that most of my morals and standards are circumstancial.i hold to them when it is very convenient for me. I really can't spell at all. sometimes that makes me feel really stupid. i play it off like its funny but most of the time its not to me. Somewhere in the back on my head, i really dont think that i will ever become a doctor. which really sucks. I still compete with katie all the time without wanting to. I am getting better but it is still hard. I want to be skinnier. I really think that is just a chick thing. I miss deep conversations. i miss one persons full attention. there is something about having someone's whole and undivided attention that makes you feel special. I am a B. sometimes i am in such a weird mood that the way certain people say my name grates my nerves. i feel bad for those people. they dont deserve it. i live in a fantasy world in my head. its easier and honestly i dont see anything bad about it. its so sad it really shows how much of a priss i am. i really wish that faries existed. they would be so pretty. i am so ready for college i could pop. i want new people and new surroundings. i love my friends i really do. they are the most important people in the world. I couldn't love them more. i suck at showing it but it is the truth. Things hurt me so much more than people think they do. its really easy to make me cry. although i will never cry in front of people. I miss summer so much. all this cold weather kills me. i miss volleyball and going down to the pier to the swing. everything just seems so much easier in the summer. i love the fact that i am southern. no offense to yankees but i absolutely love my heritage. in my moms words ""they may have won the civil war, but we had prettier dresses."" lol i love my mom. she's crazy. I am a horrible driver. i dont pay attention and i am lucky to have only gotten in as many wrecks as i have. i like to smile. it works the muscles in your face. anyway okay its like 1:30 and i am soooo tired. so i am going to go to bed now. peace out ya'll

I don't know why katie is stressing out so much about that alabama thing. she'll get it done, she always does. I cant wait to go shopping tomorrow! i can only get one shirt because i am saving up for christmas and all but hey i get a new shirt. i was thinking about it today. my family really doesn't have a big  christmas and that always used to bug me when i was little. it doesn't anymore. we dont have a big christmas so we dont have to worry about money half way through jan. they don't feel like they have to buy my affection and plus with anna and my aunt staying at out house on christmas, it really isnt about me anymore. i love waking up to this precious little 4 year old pulling at my sleeve on christmas morning. i love seeing the look on her face. the innocence in a little child who still really believes without a doubt that santa is real is absolutely charming. im not the baby anymore, she is and christmas caters to her. i love it. people always told me that it isnt about what you get that matters but what you give. i didnt really get that till just a while ago. i am so exicted to give everybody their gifts. as much as i whine and complain and blow things out of proportion and am a complete brat sometimes... i am truely blessed. i couldn't ask for anything more in my life. what else could i want?

    this weekend was wonderful. i mean absolutely wonderful. friday night daphne trojans beat auburn. Yay go trojans!!! then me, sarah shields, ira kathleen ,andrew,brian and erica all went to eat a semolinas. i dont think erica likes me very much at all, but shes sweet so i dont know. sat. i slept in for the first time in a long time, then went and got my hair done, and then hung out with kathleen webb and crystal for a while. then we met up with a bunch of other people at mayday pier and we were out there for like 5 hours in the cold. but it was the funniest time of my life. not bounce off the wall laugh till your stomach hurts kinda fun but fun like you get that warm fuzzy feeling fun. one of the guys named BJ played the guitar the whole time and we all like randomly sang songs. okay it sounds stupid but it so fun. we were all bundled up sitting on a pier in the middle of the night singing mostly praise and worship songs, they all had so much passion, it was very uplifting. the two guys that i hadn't met before, billy and BJ, were really really cool, i liked em' both alot. 
Now for the frustration...
  our catapult...i hate it. i am so stressed and so frustrated and i cant wait to have the bonfire so we can burn it. me and nathan got into a fight tonight. i feel really bad. i hate people being mad at me. i was close to tears tonight. i found a new workout that absolutely kicked my butt. i love it. it really works like all your muscles. its awesome. i get to go see Elf on thursday YAY! friday is the football game so thats really good. And then sat. i leave for mexico!!! i am finally going to get a tan which is such a good thing. big big yay! i am so exicted. i cant wait. anyway i am going to go to bed now and dream of being on the really big boat out in the middle of the ocean.

I miss the kind of closeness i had with you, but in a way i am kinda glad we split because i am learning to grow by myself. im going to just stop calling and let you go by your own time schedule because i can't stay subject to it. it annoys the crap out of me. Julie and i talked about prom today. that was interesting. i have no clue who i want to go with. well maybe thats a lie, maybe i do have some idea but i can't say anything right now :) today was good i got to see jessica johnsons presentation. she was dolly parton and it was the funniest thing i have ever seen. she as dolly saying that her boobs were ""homegrown""...i was on the floor. i have a deep thought so bear with me. mary and pippin were talking on lord of the rings two and mary said ""pippin we still have the shire lets just go home."" and pippins response was something like ""the dark hand of sarron reaches far eventually the forest of something and something will burn."" it made me think...satan has taken over movies, school, ethics, ect. and yet we seem to stop fighting when we enter the church and we can't do that. the enemys only desire is to destroy, if we think that he wont come after the church then we're stupid. two of my favorite quotes are ""its not who plays the best that wins, but who wants it the most. and victory goes to the player who knows the value  of every inch. peace out dont stop

     tonight we went to coffee loft. it was just me elizabeth, julie and cori for most of the night. Brittany and kathleen showed up for a little while but they left pretty quick cause brittany had to be home at 8 for some reason. anyway we just sat outside and talked for 2 hours. it was undoubtably the greatest conversation i have ever had. we talked about spiritual stuff and God and it was just so calming and encouraging. i didnt really realize it until tonight but cori is amazing she is the coolest person i have ever met. she is really wise. its like you are talking to a 100 year old in a 15 year olds body. but yea anyway all business today rocked. we actually had imput and it made me feel like we actually had a say in what went on. it hasn't been like that in a while. i am at such a peace with God. i had a revelation tonight i was praying in the car on the way home and i was like ""God its like i am living in this fog and i cant seem to get out of it."" and then these chapters from like numbers popped into my head and they talked about the priest and when they entered the holy of holies and it described when the spirit of God fell what it was like. and i remember that those chapters described the holy of holies as almost a foggy room right well i thought about that for a while and realized yes, i do live in a fog and that fog is the spirit of the most high God. everyday i am enveloped in the spirit of God its all around me all the time but its only when i recognize and accknowledge the presence of God that i unleash his power in my life. i know that probably didnt make any sense but it did when i prayed so oh well i got something out of it. i really miss katie. like we're okay but its not like it used to be. i know that i've changed and so has she but it still sucks. i think its cause we dont talk anymore. like we used to be together all the time. like we stay at each other's houses and just talk till like 2 in the morning. but now its like we cant even be honest with each other cause we are walking on egg shells. i will admit that most of this is all my fault and i dont know how to fix it but i just want her to know that i really miss her friendship. Cori said something to me tonight that really hit me. we were talking about things in the youth group that could be done better or what we would like to see and she said ""well your a department head why dont you say something?"" i have dropped the ball as a leader. like i just got so lazy that i just...lost it. so its time to get  back to business but anyway its bedtime for me. so peace out dont stop.

   hey hey!!! you know what...for like 2 or 3 months i haven't really felt the peace of God Now that i am slowing regaining my focus my soul finally has the peace of God i forgot how good it felt this is going to sound corny but its like my spirit and soul have had a long nap it feels great i gave up secular music for a while i realized a few days ago how far i had really drifted in my relationship with God and decided that the apathy and laziness had to go so i am trying to get back to where i was i am learning how great and gracious of a God i serve rock on God yay! i need to work on my relationships with some people too more specifically katie i really miss her friendship like we're friends now but its not the same but we have a cruise in nov. and its just going to be me and her on a boat with my psycho family if that doesn't bring us closer together then only God can help lol anyway i have to go to scholarship stuff now. peace out dont stop.

i know this i have known this for a long time but some seasons suck i do see a good end to it though i am really learning alot about myself there is a book that i love called the three kings its awesome in one part it talks about how david had to go through hard times so that God could remove the ""Saul"" characteristics i think thats kinda whats going on with me too. my mom and i got into it today quite disapointing but hey leave it to my mom to set me straight she really brought up some good points of course i got mad at her for them but hey she had some I think i am going on the pill and i am really freaked scarey stuff but its not that big of a deal but still...you know i realized today that just cause everyone else is slacking gives me absolutely no excuse to do the same i cant justify slips in integrity just because everyone else can mrs. denton julie and i talked about being conformed to the image of this world today and what the bible says about it it was a very good conversation to hear i needed to hear it i really need a fresh start either that or a kick in the butt by God maybe both my apathy is really getting bad i need to take care of that its time to buckle down and get back to business. anyway peace out don't stop :)

"event","so laid back. i had to babysit tonight till like 12 i didnt mind it though b\c the kid slept the entire time. hey i got paid for staying awake and watching tv so it was pretty cool. i went to the game friday. it was a good game. and then me, jamie, ira, katie and amanda hung out at amanda's and watched two weeks notice. katie was mean to me pretty much the entire night and most of this morning. but whatever. i am learning that i really need to brach out and spend more time with more people. like at the football game i talked to jamie and tiffany. they are both such awesome people. i dont know why i didnt see that before. amanda rocks too. she cracks me up b\c she's so honest but yet she does it to where she's honest but she doesnt hurt peoples feelings. an art i have yet to perfect but oh well working on it ;) okay its getting late and i really need to sleep. church early tomorrow. peace out dont stop.

 church was awesome. i couldn't have better friends. and i think i am finally understanding what the peace of God really means. I dont think i really ever got it before. Adam and i came to an agreement about homecoming. see he's going to be broke and i really dont want to spend the money on the dress and stuff. so i think me and him are going to hang out that night and just chill. since there are no heels involved in that it has much less chance of injury. i am really tired. me, megan, julie, and adam all went out to eat with pastor chad tonight. it was awesome. he makes me laugh so hard. and then he payed for all of us which was really cool. but anyway it is my bed time so peace out dont stop.

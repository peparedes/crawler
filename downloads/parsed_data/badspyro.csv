I'm not doing much, apart from messing around on the computer because I don't like going out on my own, so I just stay in all the time and get fat.... I am so going to die of a heart attack, which as far as I'm concerned is V. bad... I allways wanted a very painful and violant death... Oh, well...
I also ordered a mini ipod from Amazon.co.uk, which will be shipped out this saterday, so I am sooo excited!!!"

"event","Not as good as we would have first thought.... Still had little brother, and so, with mum off to find a boyfriend, we were left with mums school friend, Julia... She doesn't like loud noise, and so, was doomed from the word go... Andrew (my brother) and I don't fight physically that much, we just shout an awful lot, so the day was doomed... 
First her sister came round, and the day looked hopeful, as her children kept Andrew fairly happy, and to further keep the peace I brought down my big box of Lego, which they gladly played with for the best part of an hr, and then we went into town, where I changed my library books and Julia did some banking, and then her sister split off from us, and the outlook was bleak...
After some more playing, and Julia having a nap, we headed off to catch a film... Mean Girls... Good film, I recommend it, But I don't recommend letting your brother take in a flash light, as he will, as in this case, invariably switch it on... And he refused to tern it off until I threatened to break it... This blatant NO! attitude carried on until he went to bed... Then it was time to tern down the music for him to get to sleep... Does nobody except me realise that he reads in bed until 11!?! Well, they never noticed with me...

Today I went for my interview at the 6th form collage that I want to go to... Very nervus... went ok though... Place looks nice, and nobody has coplained about the computer system being 'primitive' <i>yet</i>...

So, mum got Chris (my suspended frend) and I were set to work on the garden... What Chaos... Oh, well... Now spending far too mutch time in front of the PC... I'm getting fat... Will soon not need to ask if my bum looks big in this... I will already know the answer...

Friend was suspended from his school for kicking in a door, so his mum asked if we could look after him.... Mum said yes... Mad fool!!!

First thing we did was pick him up from his house, then we went shopping!!! First we went to a craft store for some cross stitch things for mum, and I looked for some stuff for my project... sadly no luck... Mum also couldn't find what she was looking for, so we went on to the next shop, where I found both the D rings and the elastic cord!!! Hooray!!! I now like that shop... A lot...

Next we went to the optitions for some new glasses for me, I chose a pair, and then they phoned up saying that I had used up my voucher in January!!! I only got it in May!!!

Then we came home and I tried all afternoon to phone Kaz.... No such luck.... The library trip was well and truly put off for the moment.... That was in between bouts of gardening, in which the strimmer broke... Twice!!!

At least I can get on with my project now...

stardate 2346423 (yeah right!, like I'm gona know that!)
Ok, so I'm sorta into star trek and sit on a computer most of the day... Does that imedeately make me a Trekie? probably.... do I care.... probably&nbsp; not...
A little bit of background here... I'm 16, and thus have just finished my exams about 2 weeks ago (some days I don't know what day of the week it is, never mind how long ago something was) and since then, I have been walking about town, eating the weirdest things and sitting in front of one of 3 things:

1. a good book (just finished Briget Jones Diary)

2. a TV (music channels and Karrang Radio ""Life is loud"")

3. my worst habit, a computer

So, I lead a pritty un-for filling life, dreaming of things I want to do, and not doing them, except for some exceptions, like my website... and that took me a year... 

I decided to change the game plan a bit though today, I now have a project... I am going to make myself a pair of trousers... I have just started making the patterns for it... I expect them to take all holiday, as I need to make the patterns myself and am trying to keep the project a secret... With the mess that my room is in, nobody could find anything anyway... not even me sometimes...

I also tried to find out the import duty on an ipod from the US from HM customs and excise.... Never do that again.... there website is a load of rubbish, doesn't tell you what you want to know, but tells you everything else.... Bad start to the day....

Next I went into town for some retail therapy, and to get some hair dye (the new non perminant mouse), but nobody had it.... AAAGH.... Then I went and got some stuff for the aforementioned project... outcome of the retail therapy was positive, though not helped by Boots and other acociated shops...

I came home, sat down and tried to get the customs and excise information on the phone, and gave up after being passed on to numorus people, none with the information I needed.... What a surprise!

Then mum came home and organized a Blitz of the house... She had invited some people round from Church... Not good.... Had the church principles weighed down on me while eating my tea, and my little brother was worse than his usual hyper self... not good, but the food was... Spag Boll.. good food, but need to cut down... getting a bit fat... no, getting a lot fat...

so here I am, sitting at my greatest vice, after watching the eviction on Big Brother... why vote Marco out!?! He was the only half sane person in the house apart from Shell! Neeed more retail therapy tomorrow.... thank goodness tomorrow's saterday!

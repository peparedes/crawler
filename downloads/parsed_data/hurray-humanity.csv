Open windows, crisp breeze
Taking shoes off after class and driving barefoot (note: crisp breeze)
Beautiful bright bright bright autumn leaves everywhere, enough to make your heart explode
Blasting tunes, and singing until my voice cracks
Greeting the deer and the squirrels walking alongside the road very enthusiastically
Laughing at myself alone in my car (see above two)"

"event","dear friends, 
im in a pickle. i had the hard drive to my computer replaced and lost all my music. but hey no problem because all my music is on my ipod right? WRONG! my ipod is busted now, too! and i'm afraid it's past the point of repair. ive been without my music for weeks now and i feel like im dying slowly. its a major bummer on top of other things. 
what would make me reeeallly really happy would be either mix cds, or even just some friendly file sharing online. i would appreciate it more than anything!

loooove,

i am shocked and devastated. my mom called and woke me up this morning to tell me what happened. i couldn't believe it. he was one of my idols and i've always had the hopeful intentions of meeting him someday. he completely revolutionized environmental education and has done so much to conserve wildlife. i don't know what to think right now, it was such a freak accident. i'm so upset."

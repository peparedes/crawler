Im sorry that i didnt ask her to the dance when i had the change but it seemed she didnt fucking mind that i was hurting pretty bad.  i told her that i was jealous of adam but the truth is i wasnt. But she didnt know because she didnt take the time to realy ask me. no she was more worried about finding her fucking date!  im sorry that i seem like i'm selfish but you would be too. i even droped my date for homecoming so i could spend alittle time with her. thats all i ask and she only dance with for one and a half songs. she pulled adam in to the dance floor twice and didnt give me a thought. i just stood there like a stupid fucking jack ass.  why did i even fucking go."

"event","also here is a realy fucking funny joke. ok


there was this girl named marry,who also fell asleep in sunday school.  when the teacher asked ""marry who is the almighty?"" Here friend timmy poked her with a tooth pick and she woke up screaming ""god almighty."" Then the teacher asked ""marry who is our lord?"" Marry woke up screaming jesus christ. Then the teacher ask ""Marry what did Eve say to Adam after she had her 23 child?"" Before timmy had a change to poke her she woke up screaming ""If you stick that damn thing in me one more time I'm gonna break it in half.""
lol enjoy."

hair spiked like the thorns
which protects its beauty
her smile
lights you up inside
hold her close
to warm your soul
her face is soft like silk
she makes you laugh 
even when she hurts inside
you want to protect her
keep her safe from ant danger
hold her tight and close
in the middle of your bedroom floor
glad you met her.

why do i walk in at the wrong time?

Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle

This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked, but here they come again to jack my style

Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on.

Well, that is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home;
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call ""love""
When I look into my nephew's eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...
Some terrible nights*... ah...

Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh oh
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... oh...
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... oh...</i>"

The rain falls on the street outside my window on this Tuesday afternoon.
I sit alone inside these sinful walls I've lived inside.
So many lies have lived and died; none so much as the one I lived with you.

I see you on the highway a thousand miles away.
Rain falls through your hair and cheeks.
Tears and mascara streaks.
Your face reflected in the glass.
Lines in the pavement go past just like the lines around your eyes that held away to an endless sad goodbye.

Everybody that I know said I should've just let you go.
You run from everything, you see.
Hurt the ones you love like me.
But here I sit and picture you with fingers worn your shirts on, too.

Your heart's so big and broke in two.
Your mind drifting through all you knew.

<b>Afraid to love; afraid to lose;
Afraid to start; afraid to choose;
Afraid to live; afraid to die;
Afraid to let these days go sail by;
Afraid to change or stay the same;
Afraid to lose yourself again;</b>

Afraid of the truth that love could cause you so much pain.

I know.

I felt it, too.

"event","I reach for the pen. It's no use. It will not write.

My hand shakes as I attempt to pick the pen in what seem like a milennia. My muscles sieze. The penmanship is dull, faded, and resembles that of my 5 year old former self.

I attempt to white out the blots that I've wrote down. I reanalyze the page.

I throw it out in mere fustration. I cannot fathom why I've picked up the pen after this long. It was like the pen was calling out to me. The dust was merely a magnet from which my polar opposite hand was attached to.

If only I could remember what to write. There is a gaping blank in my mind. I'm searching for a topic to describe but all my mind can grasp upon is blackness in a tumbling void that seems to pinch me to write even more.

I push myself to write something; Anything that might inspire this old steel cage.

Finally in a rage I slam the paper to the floor. I remembered that the paper could not inspire me. I could only inspire me.

So as I walk away not nearly as defeated as I thought I was I remember an old friend. An arrangement of letters and numbers. A screen encapsulated with similar minds, thoughts, and freedoms.

I remember my journal. The livejournal. The computer. The keyboard. The clamping of keys.

So almost as if the journal were breathing in my ear as I stepped down the stairs towards my computer I remember a long lost memory. I remember sitting in math class writing with headphones. I remember sitting in Language arts writing furiously while the kids were laughing and mocking me.

I remember my mind.
There you are.

As if the light were to come to the page. The reckoning. With a hastily vengenance the words sprawl across page. Like drinking from chalice of webster's dictionary the words just keep flowing.

I cannot stop.
Before long it has been a page, two pages, and pushing three. It's like the child that has not rode the bike in so long but not forgotten. They can break the wheels but the pen is stronger.

The mind is stronger. And onward I go with a neverending resolve. The pen will never end."

I'm dreaming. There is a blonde figure on my chest. She's happy. Smiling even. We lie on the bed in what appears to be her bedroom.

She turns her head to smile at me. I feel a warm beating in my chest. I think to myself ""Is this bliss?""

I wake up shortly after. The details amiss.

I go on living. Each day no longer a fleeting dream, but the reality. Years later, I walk a girl home with me. We embrace in the warm summer air, spend a few days at her parents house. I'm lying on her bed.

I tell myself to wake up. It can't be a dream. It isn't.

A few weeks later she breaks up with me. We don't speak. We don't speak for a few years after. I try to bury the feelings with anger. It does not work.

I stumble into her at a friends party. We talk for hours. We make up. We are not the best of friends, but she finds another to make her happy and has children. She's a good mother. Caring even.

I haven't spoken to her in years.

I wish her well.

I wake up.
The dream wasn't a dream. It was a reality. I can't believe how real the dream was when it started. Or when it ended.

I speak not from regret or remorse. How funny it is to see the matrix build long before the program is started."

I feel the melting sensation of a burning lava pool upon my forehead. I cannot breathe. I cough. I cough again. The vile liquid that has been keeping my lungs clouded pastes upon the kleenex. ""There is no cure for the common cold"" I thought. I lay in silence for a mere moment as to try and get my head around what was happening to me. Between the Nyquil and the smell of vapourized cough
medicine it clouds my thought. The aching of my bones are only matched by my inability to move. ""Food."" is all I thought. Perhaps the taste of something other than saliva and mucus would set me straight. As I push with all my might I find myself on the floor coughing again. ""I forgot about the waking up part. It's always a coughing fit"" I thought.

I waver from foot to foot as I approach the stairs. Each step is heavier than the one before it.

I press on.

There is something to be said about being sick all the small things become a bit more clearer. The crackling as the eggs hit the pan. The noise the coffee maker makes. And as I sit down to eat all I can do is sit in silence. The cold has made me pacified and mute.

As I finish the last bite I can't help but feel another tickle in my throat as I open my mouth to cough once more.I stumble down the stairs to the couch.

"event","I came back to Livejournal today. I read over some old posts I made, mulled over that a little bit. In retrospect, I think my writing was better than I thought at the time I wrote it. I don't know why I wrote down the things I did and I realize after reading some of the posts how much of my former self was in need of a crutch. (Harsh I know, just something I noticed.) I look back now and those experiencing HAVE made me stronger. I think I've learned a lot from living on my own, and not living underneath some one else's rules, regulations, and authority. Self reliance also became a factor, and there in lies something that I lacked in prior posts.

I am proud of myself I think I should say that. I'm proud of how far I've come, and where I've been. I think I should mark that as my first LJ related compliment in my Journal.

That being said, perhaps I should update this dear old journal? Hehe, oh the stories I have. Hell I almost got married. Haha, keyword being almost. At this point, I'm past that cocktail of heaven meets hell. It gave me one hell of a ""hangover"" though let me tell you.

I've spent these past couple weeks rebuilding from that ""drunken state"" we shall call love. I reconnected with some friends, some more willing to see my face then others. I can't say I blame them either. It must be hard to have been left alone for so long, and then have me show up on the front porch one day. I didn't expect the kind of response that I got though. Sam, Vanessa, David, and others weren't critical at all. It was then that I knew that I do have some great friends that aren't quite like any others. I think it also shows how much everyone has grown too. It's long since past those days where we got into that fight about... well whatever it was. It's been so long, I don't even know why I was mad. Perhaps they forgot too.

I haven't looked over my friends list on here either, now that I think of it. I doubt anyone has a livejournal anymore. I only came here to post some thoughts that have been swirling around my head. I think that's what I like about my livejournal. I also like the fact that I can write again. I don't write that as much as I used to.

In other news, I've kinda been getting into working out here and there when the weather is nice. I've been seriously trying to find a way to lose some extra pounds, and have fun doing so. I went out and bought a soccer ball and I kick it around for as long as my asthma will let me do so. (Sadly it's not very long but I figure it'll only get better the more I do it right?)

I'm kinda losing interesting in World of Warcraft these days. Even as we speak I'm logged into Tasa but I don't know what I want to do. I don't really have any friends to play with that are on when I play. I don't have the desire to try and redo my warrior's shit over either. I don't have a guild either. That may be a contributing factor, but I also don't really feel like being in a room with 9 other sweaty guys yelling at me either. So I usually find myself on the internet instead finding some weird fan made Metal Gear Solid stuff, or maybe random WTF pictures. I have such a weird sense of humor, and only a few people actually get GET it. And yes, I used get twice. So sue me.

Well LJ, I think I'll leave you now. That was a long post right? Maybe I'll come back and type some more when I can think of something to write.

underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood
on the boulevard the dead comes back to life
To the praying Mother
And the worried Father
Let your children go
If they come back
They'll come home stronger
And if they don't you'll know

"event","I finally am in a mood to post, after lots of thinking reflecting, I'd thought I'd put on LJ.

So how EXACTLY was 2006 for Ryan?
 
   Well, it started off the usual grind at Tim Horton's. I remember being very happy with Lindsey for a bit there, then things died off. I was quite broken, but I managed to get by. I transfered to Inkster hoping that the pain I was suffering was partly due to management problems. Turns out I was wrong, cause not long after that I went on a month vacation from work. I hated my job. They just seemed to jerk me around one day after the next. I remember working doubles 3 days in a row, and was soo blank, soo exhausted I was utterly miserable. I was a completely different person.

   Not longer after getting back from vacation, shit hit the fan. By this time, I was soo utterly depressed about my job, that I felt the same way I did when I exploded at a former employee at Mcphillips. I didn't want to repeat that clearly, as it was the most unprofessional thing I've ever done. So when I came to work that last day, I had forgotten my black shoes. They told me to go home and get my white shoes cause the District Manager wouldn't like my white shoes. I asked if I could stay as it wasn't exactly easy to get my shoes back. They sent me back on rollerblades to get my shoes. I never came back. I called them, and told them I quit.

   It was the best day of my life, and the worst. I had lost my job, I felt free for the first time in months! OMGWTF I have a life! I can do what I want!?! WTF? 

   At this point I was coming off a high point, but then became deeply depressed and sadened. I missed the people I worked with, the fun stuff we did. Kinda torn with no one to really turn to,  I played World of Warcraft for about two months straight, not realizing my own isolation. I didn't talk to anyone for those two months really. I questioned all my relationships, be it friend or foe. I just wasn't ready to be around people. I was hurt alot I guess. Fortunately reality set in after that period, when all the money I had saved from Tim Horton's had disappated. I started to realize what I was doing to myself, started thinking about options to ""awaken"" myself.

  My mom as much as I hate to admit it sometimes, is my salvation. She got me a job working demo's part time in malls on weekends, started getting me back to work and out of the house. I needed the cash, the work wasn't hard, I didn't mind it either. Not long after she landed me a job at Archway Marketing where she works. I still work there, I love the atmosphere it's soo stress free. The employer treats as humans for the most part, and pays better than I ever did at Tim's. As I started to work there I started to realize what it's like to have a REAL job, not a fast food joint. It's soo much better.

  Not long after starting at Archway, I turned 22. I honestly never thought I'd make it this far. Between all that crap my dad gave me, and some of the crap my mom did, I thought I would be a goner by now. I once heard a Limp Bizkit song where it said something like ""When you are young you are like a sponge in water, when you get older it's like you absorb it"". I really feel this describes my year as a whole. I feel like only now can I apply all that suffering to real life. It feels real, cause it is real.

  Then Christmas came once again this year. For those who know me, you know that my Christmas/New Year's has never truly been a good time for me. Something painful usually comes up. Like someone dying, someone breaking up with me, anything and just something lol. This year though, I was like a rebound year for all the years that went bad. I had nothing bad happen to me. No breaking of hearts, no drama just a warm loving holiday season.

 I went to Christmas dinner at my Auntie Pat's again this year. I have to say our family gatherings lack any sense of bonding these days, especially since my uncle passed away. This was the first Christmas that I truly missed him. The holidays shined on his face, but it certainly didn't shine at Christmas dinner when my Auntie brought her boyfriend. I don't think very many of us approve of her being so cold like she was. Throwing my uncle in a coffin, crying her crocodile tears and then running off and fucking they next guy. But that's just me.

 I skipped out on work this year to give presents, after Janet remarked ""He never give's presents"". I think out of all year, something hit me there. Just something. Cause I just thought about giving gifts to the people I love, to make them happy. To be HAPPY. So I went and looked for the best things I could afford putting alot of thought into each gift for as much as I could afford.

 I realized this Christmas how much I love Andrea. She's much more than just a friend to me. She may or may not feel that way about me, but I don't care quite frankly. When she speaks, I listen. Really listen. I thought about it and I've seen her grow up soo much from what I knew in  high school. That being said, it doesn't mean that she doesn't slip sometimes, just means she's come far. And I have to say, her love for Calvin is deep. Deep Deep. From all the guys I saw her with, I never quite saw her connected to someone like Calvin. In fact, for awhile in the summer when I didn't talk to you I was concerned, that I'd never talk to you again. That's not something that sat well in the back of my head trust me. Also Andrea if you read this, I want to thank you so very much for being, you. For being so awesome. I can't hide the fact that I care, you mean alot to me. Like that other sister I didn't get or something. I would hug you to the end of time if you wanted me to. Just for reference. :D

 I think I can safely say that this year was just wow. I think I'm starting to grow and mature a bit more, I feel like I'm absorbing something special, something that makes me appreciate who I am. I'm not running away or crying about what's wrong with me. I'm just me. I'm starting to like  being me again. That's important. :D

Wow I typed alot, I wonder if I'll be able to wake up tomorrow at 9am :p That's gonna be a motherfucker to do. Bleh.

Anyways, if you read this. Thanks. You are taking some time out of your day to hear what I think. Obviously you care. I care. And if no one cares, then so be it. I'll do what I do best...

But man I'm thinking of deleting and restarting this LJ thing... I may lose some entries ..but who the hell cares never wrote alot for value anyways :D Partly due to a lack of html knowledge i'm afraid -_-;;;

Or what I might do is a complete overhaul of the whole layout again ... but the thought sickens me... I can't even remember how to do LJ cuts....lawl But enough said.. expect an update soon enough :D Whether or not that's a good thing remains to be seen lol

I was just the age of sixteen
When I first went on the drive
After six months hard labour
At home I did arrive
And courted with a pretty girl
'Twas her caused me to roam
Now I'm a River Driver and I'm far away from home

CHORUS:
I'll eat when I am hungry
And I'll drink when I am dry
Get drunk whenever I'm ready
Get sober by and by
And if the river don't drown me
It's down I'll need to roam
For I'm a River Driver and I'm far away from home

I'll build a lonesome castle
Upon some mountain high
Where she can sit an view me
As I go passin' by
Where she can sit an view me
As I go marchin' on
For I'm a River Driver and I'm far away from home

CHORUS

When I am old and feeble
And in my sickness lie
Just wrap me up in a blanket
And lay me down to die
Just get a little bluebird
To sing for me alone
For I'm a River Driver and I'm far away from home

CHORUS x2

For I'm a River Driver and I'm far away from home"

Really I'm coming out of a month long depressive state wondering where to go next from here, kinda wishing I'd have some companionship which has been lacking lately. But yet again I hold my own don't ask me how ;p It just kinda happens.

"event","Well basically in short the title means that lately I've ran into alot of people that I never talk to, was barely friends with, and they all keep saying hi to me and ultimately I wonder why...

I really don't understand the impact that seems to draw people towards me I guess, or why the feel the need to approach me. It's not that I mind, hell I miss alot of people, it's just surreal when I stop to think about it. Like what value did I give these people that they even still remember me? Really sometimes it baffles me...

I guess I give myself to little credit perhaps being nice to people all the time makes people think that I'm actually a good person all the time, when really it's quite the opposite.

I dunno but ultimately I'd like to say, please keep saying hi to those of you who haven't seen me in awhile now more than ever I want to make myself feel awkward to get over the past. I want to feel that way so I can stop running from it like I have :D

That is all I have to say about that :D"

Alot of times this causes alot of conflict on myself cause I have to intial reactions to what people say to me, one that says ""you bitch"" another that says ""sorry"" So I don't know lately I've been leaning on the fuck the world mentality, stirring up shit for myself saying stuff I don't mean...which is really easy to do, I think alot of stuff that normally doesn't come out but the odd time it spills out hehe

There is no real point to this post actually just thinking out loud lol :P Have had alot of time to think at work and home, not many people to talk to as of late so I rely on other means such as LJ to get some of my thoughts out in the open, off my chest :D

I know I've had this feeling today, and I have to say it's weird to think in such a way after a long time... I wonder what it would be like it everyone I used to be around could forget the things we said to each other and just talk again...? And in the very back of my mind I start to remember people I once deeply cared about: old girlfriends that I haven't talked to a long time, wonder if they still think about the times they shared with me, or if they've long forgotten the fun we had long ago...

Hmm, every once in a while it's good to reflect on things remember the things that now are memories and hope that one day you can see those people again, talk and maybe even be friends again, and stop holding onto the things that they did to you oh so long ago...

Then again what do I know, I'm just a supervisor that works at Tim Hortons :P What knowledge could possibly come from pouring a cup of coffee?"

Empty is nothing and nothing is you

"event","Wow! It's been quite the year! I can't say it's been easy or exceedingly hard but another year has come and gone! :O It's like I'm losing my grip on the time that's passing me by!?!

As far accomplishments, I'd have to say that my greatest accomplishment was being able to move out and be on my own! It's really taught me about how life is outside of home, how expensive it is to do it, but most importantly, how much I enjoy to be my own boss. I don't like being accountable to someone as much as I do to myself, which I can say at times is good and bad all the same.

Also, being able to work at a job steady for a year has been hard, but I think I've learned a lot from it. Like how responsibility works, and how people take advantage of you when you are nice or caring, and just seeing people come and go... It's been hard cause of a lot of them kept me going over time and kept my job fun, and I can probably also say that without them around it's getting harder in this new year to keep myself motivated to work as hard as I did back when I started...

I also want to say that as I start this new year I can't help but be hopeful for the future for the things that are happening good or bad. I mean I'm always trying to keep my perspective in a way that keeps me looking from the outside looking down on myself. In that way, I can say whatever I do I can be proud of, and try to have less regrets about the way things are or how I want them to be.

And now lets get down to the buisness! NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS!!! XD;;;

1) <b><i>Try to have some MORE fun.</b></i> I've noticed that as time passes on I've been less able to enjoy my life and that each day is getting to be more like ""which stress should i worry about today?"" I need to take things in strides and have some more fun instead of being locked up in a big ball of stress all the time.

2) <b><i>I want to get to know everyone I know better/Spend more time with people I care about.</b></i> Wow this really comes down to the fact that I miss Andrea, Calvin, Cory, Marni, Lindsey and the whole lot of people. We need to touch base again sometime and get a big old gaming thing going again hehe.

3) <b><i> I want to change jobs this year sometime.</b></i> This is partly cause I've accomplished my goals for myself at Tims and I don't think staying there too much longer will accomplish much more than making me a bitter person hehe. Or at the very least I plan to change the scenery. Transfer to a store that won't jerk me around as much.

4)<b><i> Get a plan for the future. </b></i> I really need to stop procrastinating and get an idea of what i want to do and like so i can spend the time to pursue it. Cause times a ticking hehe


There are more but they are too personal to type in here hehe...

Happy Holidays and Love you Lin-Lin :3"

I would like to blame it on several things including:

1) That bitch at work that keeps giving both me and my friend a hard time! She's makes me so upset that it makes me want to quit sometimes! I'm not going to though; I'm not gonna give into her lame games :P

2) You know you really care about a person when you can't fall asleep at night without talking to them at least once! And it so happens that I can't fall asleep now, because I haven't talked to Lin-Lin yet :P It's become a ritual so to speak, the part of my day that climaxes everything and leaves me feeling better about everything I did! This all sounds really lovey-dovey but it's true :D So Lin-Lin if you read this, you clearly are the reason that I go to bed at night :P I miss you! XD;;

3) Christmas :P I've been trying really hard to think of unique ideas for everyone, something new and unexpected. So needless to say I lie in bed thinking about it and not really able to come up with something good...yet! XD;; (but I really need to get that sorted out and fast! I only have a couple weeks left :O )

4) Thinking about other stuff like my teeth and what I'm gonna about them. Also I'm thinking of booking another week off in January as I'm starting to think that it might be necessary to cool down again as I'm burning out off and on these days. I also feel kinda guilty now that I haven't been home in a month or so, haven't talked to my brother mom or sister in a while. So I'm not sure how I should feel about it but needless to say it bothers me a bit.

5) I'm also trying really hard to spend time with Lin-Lin and book some days off so we can spend some time together to get to know each other better. But alas, it's hard as she's always working and so am I, so needless to say I miss her soo much sometimes. (repeated again for your agonizing pleasure :P) But I guess what bothers me is that I don't really know what she's thinking or if she even cares for that matter. That's why I'm trying my best just to spend some time to get to know her better, hopefully she cares. Cause simply put, I do! XD;;

6) Damn you Ragnarok Online! You are the reason I don't like to work :P I just want to play games all day because of you! ~shakes fist~

That is all! I WANT TO SLEEP!!!

and I could've sworn I said this before but

I MISS YOU LIN-LIN! :P

I apologize again for the neglect that I'm not writing in this journal anymore but busy bodies make busy minds and I'm busy busy busy!

So the mistake I made today was throwing an iced cappincino at someone at work today... not the smartest thing I could do but I really really had it with these people who never work, never respect me and most of all have the nerve to compare me to other supervisors. So I really lost it and stormed out of work today. Got a call from another supervisor (who is such a sweetie and is probably gonna save my ass on this one) and things seem like they may turn out okay...I hope so I really can't afford to lose my job but if it happens it happens...

And lastly, I want to say that I miss YOU LIN-LIN! I really do want to spend some more time with you and play games and whatever! I always look forward to seeing you and talking to you more than you care to know ;) I look forward to Wednesday it should be fun ;)

You see, I live for the moment sometimes, and in my haste I did not realize that I needed a rather larger power supply on top of the fact that I am unable to touch the inside of my computer if I wish to keep my warranty. That is of course, if I haven't already biffed it up without knowing. :P

Other than all of this, it makes me excited to think that at some point my computer may be able to play all those games I've wanted but could never hope to run. Even some of the classics that people have talked about  but I never really got a chance to play.

But enough about the games and about me, I talk about them a lot in here and it may bore my audience. :P

As for me, what can I say? Working hard, but got little to show for it. They made me supervisor recently, I'm happy about that because I get to get some respect lol. Okay maybe not but I was gonna quit if they didn't cause I'm not one to waste time if I want to get somewhere. But they made me supervisor, and I've had to do some scary stuff lately, like counting tills. I spent two hours that one night only to come up short 25 bucks after all that time :P Can't say the responsiblity is easy either but I'll get used to it. I'm just adjusting lol

I haven't got enough and now I'm ranting away on my LJ. I got a serious case of cabin fever. Or perhaps lack-of-fun fever. Like you know the kind that get you excited lol. I haven't had that in a while.

meh I suppose I'll just do in situations like these, what I always do, game some more. LOL

I'm really happy that I took that vacation time for the week (that is for now) because it seems like forever since I could let my not-so-creative-but-very-fascinated-with-final-fantasy brain work on just letting loose.  So the goal for this week is not even step foot near a Tim Hortons, and to totally vacate my mind on all the issues that may arise after this week.

Lastly, it's extremely important that I:

a) watch where I walk because of Dante
b) play some games (like I need to worry about that)
<s>c) go shopping</s>
<s>d) cash cheque</s>
<s>e) clean everything since it's so very dirty in here</s>
f) do laundry
g) look for posters for the room to spice things up
h) download like the little whore I am

Anything else? Oh yeah, eat properly. I find that due to the lack of time in my schedule and the laziness that insues because of it, I am less capable of feeding oneself. :P That's why I'm getting larger and I'm not talking taller :P

well now that I feel less guilty about my LJ, because I haven't really put any value into it as of late, I think some gaming is in order. And for those of you who play RO and play on the Xilero server, please help me to get to 99! XD;;

the years unfold in one moment
the voices that we heard so loud
are now suddenly silenced
inside this crowd

and you're surrounded by the lives
of those who found something to hold
so bringing everybody down
is all you know

you've been hiding so long
you can't find yourself
in this sheltered life you live
when everything you want is at your fingertips
you'll never know what need is

you're claiming to be something different
so wanting to believe
that you're better than the rest
to make up for your self-esteem
you talk to hear your own voice and
you've left me no choice but to choose
I miss the person that you were
but I don't miss you

you've been hiding so long
you can't find yourself
in this sheltered life you live
when everything you want is at your fingertips
you'll never know what need is

you're the new revolution
the angst-filled adolescent
you fit the stereotype well

1, 2, 3, Go!

As I watch your life go up in flames,
you'll swear up and down you'd like to change
but when the sun sinks slowly into the sky,
now you're right
where you started again with nothing to say,
without an argument or case
and when it's said and done and done and said,
and now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes, inside your eyes

When will you stop and realize,
the worth and value of your life?
as you suffocate yourself within this mindless,
9-5 wake up! there's more!
and your life is nobody's but yours
and now its said and done and done and said,
and now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes

You're running circles around my slow pace
you've reached the finish line only to realize there was no race
I'm sick of being stepped on for the things I choose
I give and take and now I've taken all I could

And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could"

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to fail

Drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real

I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

You shouldn't ever come around

Lost and broken,
Hopeless and lonely.
Smiling on the outside,
and hurt beneath my skin.

My eyes are fading,
My soul is bleeding.
I'll try to make it seem okay,
But my faith is wearing thin.

So help me heal these wounds,
They've been open for way too long.
Help me fill this hole,
Even though this is not your fault,

That I'm open,
And I'm bleeding,
All over your brand new rug.
And I need someone to help me sew them up.

I only wanted a magazine,
I only wanted a movie screen,
I only wanted the life I'd read about and dreamed.
And now my mind is an open book,
And now my heart is an open wound,
And now my life is an open soul for all to see.

But help me heal these wounds,
They've been open for way too long.
Help me fill this hole,
Even though this is not your fault,

That I'm open and I'm bleeding,
All over your brand new rug.
And I need someone to help me,
So you come along,
I push you away,
Then kick and scream for you to stay.
Cuz I need someone to help me,
Oh I need someone to help me,
To help me heal these wounds,
They've been open for way too long.
Help me fill this hole,
Even though this is not your fault,

That I'm open,
And I'm bleeding,
All over your brand new rug.

I need someone to help me fill them,
I need someone to help me close them up."

"event","So if you are reading this, chances are that I'm not feeling too good.

Actually not chances, I am not feeling well. I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm happy, and hurt. All one big ball of emo. 

Why you may ask? Well I'll tell you why. Where do I start? I'm happy because I feel less aggravation towards everything. Living isn't as much of a chore. I'm learning continually, and I'd like to think that along the way I've matured. For the better or worse is for those around me to judge.

I'm angry because of the way I've treated people in the past, that wasn't right. And chances are that if you are reading this I've apologized. If I didn't, I will say it one more time. I'm sorry. I was so very stupid back then and was so very blind. I walked over those I cared about, like I always do. I can understand if now we're far apart and not really much of friends, I am terrible person and should suffer for it. I also believe that if you could forgive me, I would love to start over from scratch without the assumptions the lies the deception. All over.

I'm sad and hurt because my uncle who was pratically my father passed away. I feel more sorrow today than I did when my father passed away, and even my baba. I feel physically sick, like throwing up. He meant a lot to me and got me through those times that were really hard, that even some of my friends couldn't help me with. So I feel low, starting a cycle of self loathing, depression, and sadness.

I'm fustrated because people are fighting and thinking that I have to be friends with only them. That hanging out with another person from another group is wrong, or helping a friend of mine that is down with a problem ONLY to get ridiculed for helping them. ""Why would you do that? What about them they would have to quit their job?"" Is what I heard, and I was infurated. How could my very own stoop as low to not recognize the importance of helping another? How can I CHOOSE sides? So that's ENOUGH!!! I don't want to be a part of anything if you can't see the love that I'm trying to give to EVERYONE! By now you know who you are, and I'm sorry but I can't be told what is right and who I'm friends with. You may carry hatred, but I don't wish to share that. I'm a lover not a fighter.

I'm proud of someone who stood up for me. She surprised me, and shocked me. I was never expecting her too, and for it I owe the biggest of apologies. I criticized her, not knowing anything, gave her bad looks and cold shoulders, while all the while she still stood as my friend. Assumptions on my part were greatly wrong.

I'm sickened by the acts of those who hurt destroy and maim others. I only wish I could help them see what they do to those around them, and the profound effects of the lies they spread.

Lastly, I'm tired. I work too hard. I evny my uncle for now he gets the enternal rest while I am only satisfied with the rest of night, which only lasts 6-8 hours. And while I don't wish to die quite yet, I evny that peace. For it all to be over. The pain, the suffering, and most of all the hate. I'm tired of hate.

Hate is the root of the evil that began it all. If everyone could share just a little more love, we'd be happier. And should one more person hate me for this post and not see the point I'm trying to point out, then may god strike me down.

Enough said,
My lamenting is done.

Mainly because I've changed everything around on myself, by deciding to stay at Tim Horton's. As an addition to that I'm starting my ""training"" to be supervisor. It's got me <i>really</i> tired, and I'm already seeing the amount of work that I've gotten myself into. Then again, I never said that staying at tim's would be easy, but ultimately I want to try this and see if I can make it work. ;)

Then there's that thing called moving out which is a blessing and a curse in the same sentence.

A blessing because:

a)close to work. 5 minutes away. Score!
b)my <b>OWN</b> space. I haven't had that since I was 10.
c)I can budget better and not have to pay for my mom's bills.
d)As a contiunation of c) I get more value for my money.

A curse because:

a) my mom thinks that I'm treating her terribly for moving out
b) my mom thinks that I don't care about her anymore
c) I work too much 
d) my mom had her surgery and bitches about the lack of work I do as a result of c)

Meh, it would seem the curse just boils down to my mom, but I could be wrong. Don't get me wrong I love her, she's my mom and all. But geez, how much more can a guy take? I work for a living now, even if it is long hours and crappy pay, I'm not at home anymore. So I don't see why moving out should be such a big deal. I wish she could be a little more reasonable about it.

Other than that life is boringly simple. So much so I wish I had more time to think about something other than work or sleep. But I really appreciate these weekends with my friends, because I don't get to seem them often. And have a feeling that it'll get worse before it gets better.

That's it. That's all. I have nothing else to say.

No matter what I do it seems that every person in the bloody FUCKING world is against me and <b>DOESN'T</b> give a fuck and <b>DOESN'T</b> seem to understand the methods to my own madness!

Not that I expect everyone to care about me but would <b>ONE GODDAMNED PERSON </b>just stop to think and just listen to what I have to say!!!

<b>SO ANGRY!!! >:(

UGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</b>

Now that I got this out of my system, I can better explain what the above pertains to...

Now a couple days ago, I got to talking with Craig about his job at A&W. He told all about it and how plans to take it over and blah blah blah, you get the point. So in my not so thinking and implusive state I put in my two weeks notice, not really thinking of the consequences pertaining to that. So now, I have an interview today, and lets just say that if I don't get this job, I'll be homeless, foodless, familyless and ultimately FRIENDLESS.

Now that it is three days later, my guilty conscience kicks in. I can help but ask my conscience....

<b>WHERE THE BLOODY FUCKING HELL WERE YOU 3 BLOODY DAYS AGO!!! UUUUUUGGGGGH! I HATE YOU CONSCIENCE!!! >:( </b>

Then my conscience would say some dumb shit like it was on vacation. lol jj

So, now that the entire world around me hates me what else could I <i>possibly </i>have happen to fuck me up worse??? <i>Oh YEAH.</i> I have the weekend off but Andrea is going to Saskatchewan. :P Ah, but what does it matter when she hates me too. :P

So really there's not much else to say. I have fucked things up and now I sleep in the pile of shit I made. Yay. Go me. I rock. ~insert false enthusiasm and sarcasm here~

"event","I'm still working as an office assistant for the State, and I've been doing well with that.
Kinda sick at the moment, and truly hoping I feel better soon, as I can't afford to miss much work (I don't have any sick time saved up, so I get docked for any time I miss).
Jacob bought me a promise ring for Christmas (along with some other awesomeness), and I am totally in love with it, and him.
It is an antique ring I saw in this tiny little shop window one night as we were passing by. I pointed it out to him saying it was lovely, and he bought it, and surprised me at Christmas with it. We had to have it resized and shank of the ring and the tips that hold the diamonds on fixed a bit. It cost a ton, but Jacob said, and I quote ""You're worth it...and besides...we can pass it down someday""
Can you say D'AWW?!
So, no, it's not an engagement ring (like one of my co-workers thought), but I think that I'm glad it's not...I'm not ready for that. And neither is he. I want to get a better job and we need to move in together, and he wants to go to college. Things are going well right now, I just sometimes forget that as we seem to be stagnating a bit.
He's assistant manager at the Starbucks he works for now, and I have less than 3 months left in my probation period (I'm hoping to become an Office Technician, which starts at 300 more a month to begin with once the probation ends).
I'm also 178, and going down. That means I've lost a total of 72 pounds, and I have less than 30 pounds to my original goal.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be happy once I get there, but we'll see!
I'm happy in general every day now, with minor ups and downs from little bits of stress....But over all, I am happy, content, and loved.
I think the only bit of really sad news I have is that my Grandmother has cancer. They operated on her, and took out the bit of her colon that had the cancer in it, but then they did a test and found out that there is cancer in her lymph nodes as well. She has to have chemotherapy, and I'm scared for her...But I'm hoping that she will end up healthy in the end, and stronger than before.
If you pray, pray for her, and if not, please just keep her in your thoughts now and then.
She believes very heavily in God and Christ, and the power of prayer, and if anyone ever deserved his love, she does.
Okay, I'm off to find some dinner.
I hope all of you are well :)"

I'm still an Office Assistant, and while I'm making money, it's not enough to live on my own. So, I continue to live with Jacob, which is actually working out well.
We're seeing a counselor and she's helped us tremendously with our issues with the relationship, and within ourselves, especially mine, and how Jacob deals, or doesn't deal, with them.
I feel more grown up every day, which is very odd.
Then again, I will be 23 in less than 3 months. Weirdddd.

I want a better paying job, but then again, I know it won't happen over night. So for now, I pass my probation in 4 months, then see what happens :)

I'm losing weight, but it's VERY slow going. I'm around 182 now, with a goal of 150 by July next year. I go to 24 hour fitness probably 2-3 times weekly, and want to get a rowing machine, or something like that, for home. I also want a heart monitor, but those things will have to wait until after Christmas, and my next pay check....haha.

I'm doing some extra work for the State, some workers rights flyers that needed editing and redesigning, so at least there's that! That's over time, which is only like, 134 for 11 hours, because they tax so god damn much, but it's something extra at least.

I'm excited that Christmas is near, but I also know that I can't send out my gifts soon enough. Those of you who know you're getting gifts from me, we'll just have to meet up in person, kay? &lt;3 LOVES!!!

Okay, off to wrap Jacob's present!
I can't get to LJ from work, it's blocked, so if any of you want to talk to me while I'm at work, just email me there okay?

I'm picking up everything really quickly and one of the student assistants said that two of the higher ups

I have a stable job that has security, and medical and dental benefits. I am going to be so happy with this, because it means I only have 8-5 from Monday to Friday to work....and then I can work on whatever I want after that. 

I can keep my awesome part time job with Willo, and anything else I want to. 

Hurray! :D

I'm going to be living with Jacob for a bit...But I'm going to start looking for a room in about a month or so.

"event","My body kinda hurts from working out two days in a row, but I'm also tired because I haven't been sleeping well lately...I don't really know why and it's beginning to bother me.
I also don't know what's going on with Jacob anymore.
I love him, and I'm in love with him...but right now.... I don't know what to do, or how to act around him.
It's really really confusing, like my world is kinda tipped on end.
Everything I'm working towards right now doesn't seem to have any long term goals.
Why am I getting a job, other than to pay back my loans? What's the end result?
I want a family, a career, stability and happiness, but none of that seems possible at the moment with everything held on by a simple, invisible, and fraying thread.
This could also possibly just be a reaction due to my body kicking off endorphins and such, but I don't think so.
I'm also annoyed that things aren't working out the way I want...

But&nbsp; I think I'll just have to deal.
And hope I get that job, so my life has some sort of meaning again."

I'd rather tell the stories in person, and I won't be seeing any of you for something like 35 days. (yes I'm counting)

I miss you all so much. My family, friends...my boyfriend.
Jacob and I had a minor fight which was quickly solved by talking right before I went to Paris, and I've been okay without speaking to him more than a few times since then. We did have a silly/cute text exchange which some of you (i.e. Cassie) would find funny.

Me: I'm in the Louvre. I think I'm gonna cry.

Jacob: Beautiful?

Me: Beyond my wildest dreams.

Jacob: Good. Now stop texting before you end up owing the phone company our first born child. I love you.


Hehe. Sorry, just had a rocky start what with being apart for a month and a half. Now it's all good. 

Paris is dirty, the people can be rude, and NO ONE knows what personal space is. Oh, and it's not rude to stare.
I wish for Paris' beauty, with America's politeness (at least where I'm from anyway)

Tonya and her husband came and got us, and we're now located at their home in Kaiserslaughtern. We have the guest room, internet access whenever we want, and phone priviledges (it's supposedly super cheap to call. I'm happy with this :)

I got on the plane this morning after saying goodbye to my crying Mother and my somber boyfriend (who kept telling me it would be okay as I teared up). Alysha and I were on and off planes all day, running to the next one thinking we were late, only to find out that it was delayed. We eventually made our way onto the plane that would fly from Philadelphia all the way to Frankfurt, Germany. The stewardess started us off great, ""please stay seated, the plane could break at any time...."" Of course, she meant the plane could brake (STOP MOVING) at any time on the runway while we were waiting for our turn to take off...But nonetheless it got a titter of laughter out of the tired/nervous/annoyed passengers.

By this time, my whole body ached, my feet were swollen, and I'd cried a few times. I'm going to be gone for a month and a half, without any contact with anyone but the net and the phone. I thought I would have even less contact than I now know I'll have.
I'm much less concerned now....but about 6 hours into the Philly~&gt;Frankfurt flight, in the middle of ""Catch and Release"" while Alysha snored next to me...I couldn't help but cry a bit.

The movie was incredibly sad. It was about a woman who's fiance' died...and all I can think about at that moment is ""Will I see him again?""
And of course it's a silly little thought...But the intensity of the emotion that coursed through my veins at that second denied all logic, and thus, tears. But they were releasing. I was able to cry, and then be done with it, and take tons more pictures of the gorgeous sky spreading out across the horizon.

I'll have to upload the pictures when I get home...Because for now it's just too much going on all around. We're babysitting Miranda, Tonya and Michael's youngest. She'll be 5 in April (and is darn adorable). Tonya just left to go back to Boy Scouts where their other child, Ronan is. 

I'm just happy to be here, but I also know that late at night, I'm gonna miss Jacob. But I think a month and half without me around might give him some perspective about moving out, about me, about life in general. I know I'm going to need it.

My world has changed so much in the past month. From enemies to friends back to something in between, from pre-grad to grad and now to jobless vacationing bum, from unsure to sure to heart throbbing.

I've got tons to think about, even more to do, and a billion and one places to take pictures of.
See you later :)"

"event","I've settled in a bit into my parent's house again, and finally set up my desk in the den once more.
I can take a breather and upload some photos and make a real post about my last week.

Let's start back at the beginning.

I finished up my reel with maybe a second to spare, burned the dvds, printed the portfolio, dvd labels and covers, and put everything together just in time to show up for the portfolio show. The roses were finished thanks to Justine and Jacob's help, and I managed to look pretty good in my spiffed up portfolio show wear. Didn't get anyone interested really, but my adviser brought over someone from Lucasfilm and I managed to send them an updated portfolio link today. I'm hoping to get a reply, but I'm not that optimistic.

It's funny, from thursday to saturday night, I didn't realize how much I was loved until I look back on it now.
So many people came out to my portfolio show (thank you Brad, Robert, Justine and everyone else) that didn't have to, but did. 
SOoooo many people showed up for my graduation, and I cried probably half a dozen times that day, just because I knew how much I was loved, in that very moment.
And because it's all over. I'm done with that phase in my life.
No more homework. Everything I do now, I do for myself, to get a job.

Graduation was amazing, and the party afterwards was evening more fun. I just loved having one final pig out before going back on my diet (my sister and I are walking everyday and eating better now too, thank god.) 

Here's a few pictures of everyone at the show, the graduation and the afterparty.
Heheh, I'm so happy :)

Just email me at Adriawells@yahoo.com for the address.

It's on the 24th of June from Noon till 5pm.
Bring food and drinks if you want, and games as well.
Most likely just gonna be a huge socializing event thing, so come if you want to hang out with me and my nutty family and friends.

"event","I'm lying in Jacob's bed right now, curled up with some of the worst cramps so far this year. Not so bad I'm crying or can't move without whining, but bad enough that I'm nauseous and upset at the world, but mostly upset at my uterus.
Jacob is hanging out at John's house with John and Kevvy, because Kevvy's back for only a little bit.
I told him to go, even after he offered to stay and rub my tummy for me, but I kinda wish I hadn't. I'm in pain, but I can deal with it. I just sometimes feel like being a wuss, and being selfish. But he rarely sees Kevvy, and they're best buds.

So, I'm here, just thinking in the quasi-dark, about my life, and where it stands.
The cramps are probably making me pessimistic, but I'm worried about graduation as usual. I know I'll manage it. Just have to crack down, once more, and get my list done by this weekend, and my Grammy's garden party on Saturday.
Gonna see Cass that night , hopefully.

I don't know what's going to happen after I graduate. I want to stay in the bay area, but I know I have to move back up to my rents' place for at least a little while. Until I can find a job that makes it possible to live on my own, PLUS pay for all my loans. Something like 800 a month I think.
Need to talk to my Mom about consolidation too..

I guess this entry is just random, because that's where I am right now. Just kinda floating around in my own head.
Thoughts about tomorrow, yesterday, things that haven't happened yet, and things that could have been.
I've been really weird lately, and I don't really know why, but it scares me sometimes, thinking that this mood won't pass. It's not depression in the classic sense..Just an odd odd mood. Likely, overwhelming sense of having lost myself, and in losing me, losing all around me. But then again, it could just be my imagination.
Never you mind me.
I think I just need some sleep.
And luckily, I am pretty darn tired.
Night."

to feel happy again, and part of it might be because of the meds,
 but i think the other part has 2 do w/ a certain someone. I just
 like talking to him and spending time w/ him, even as just a
 friend, he's an AWESOME friend, there 4 me whenever I need him. 
Ok, I'll stop making you guys nauseous. New news, I found out I
 need surgery, and not like b4 where the deal was, ""you should 
have it, it might make things better"". now it's like ""you need 
this surgery NOW!"" It sux big time. Plus it's a loooong recovery
 period. It'll take 6 weeks before I'll even be able 2 get outta

the hardest thing in the world to get into MSU, but it was a lil harder
 for me since I fucked up so bad my first 3 years. But, I did it. I'm 
in the university itself, I just have to go for the interview to get 
into the theater program. I got the acceptance letter on my b-day, 
which Doug seems to think is a sign. We're talking again, not 
everyday, just a lil bit every once in a while. We realized that 
even though it was hard to talk to each other all the time and not 
be w/ each other, it's even harder NOT to talk to each other.
    Gary I are still... whatever we're doing. I'm one confused lil
 girl. I've been told this isn't just a hook up, b/c he doesn't do 
that. They a few weeks ago he told me he really likes me and wants 
me to be his gf, but he's not ready -n- he's still working things 
out. Ok, no prob, not quite sure I want a bf right now either. But
 now I'm gettin mixed signals. he said he's sick of girlfriends. 
Ok, still no prob, but now I have no clue what's going on. i feel 
like I'm in the dark -n- it's not a good feeling. Don't get me 
wrong, I'm pretty happy. We're casual, but we still get benefits.
 I don't know, maybe I'm over analyzing again -n- losing it. Things
 work this way. Ok, no more thinking today... g2g2 class. Adieu."

"event","I've been presented w/ some what of a conundrum. I've had a tiny 
crush on this since the beginning of the year, -n- now after 
hanging out w/ him, it's developed into seriously liking this guy.
 the problem: my friend, let's call her V, likes him as well and 
claims to have done so for 2 years now. V has a boyfriend, but 
wants the other guy, let's call him Gary. She's been saying how
 she wants 2 break up w/ her bf (but never will) but then says how 
much she likes Gary. Now, Gary likes V, but he also likes me -n- 
other people are saying he likes V better, but that person is also
 good friends w/ V, plus I'm a strong believer in ""believe 1/2 of 
what you see -n- none of what you hear."" All I know is that both 
V -n- I really like this guy, -n- I'm not about 2 fight w/ her 4
 any1 esp. since she's my friend, but SHE HAS A BF! -N- now she 
acts pissed b/c he called me. God I hate this high school drama 
shit, I was through w/ it 2 yrs ago. If she's not gonna break up
 w/ her bf then juss let this thing w/ me -n- Gary happen, if 
anything even does happen. i don't think it's right 4 her 2 say, 
""he's mine"" when she's taken -n- knows how much I like Gary.

"event","Ok, Marc, if you're reading this, FUCK YOU! Sorry, had to get that
 else. It seems some people really know how to hide their true side,
 for 3 years. When it emerges, it can come as quite a shock. Who knew
 that someone who seemed like the sweetest guy was really a fuckin 
PEDOPHILE who only wants ass. Someone's who's up for lieutenant should
 really have watched their ass when they were dating someone 8 years 
younger. 
Ever noticed that guys really are a little thick sometimes. For example,
 when you tell them it's over, u don't want to see them anymore, they 
call you... more than 5 times... and keep calling until they talk to 
you. Stupid lesson that I shouldn't have had to learn: don't call them
 back after they've left messages on your home machine. At the risk of
 sounding like a bitch, some guys just can't take a hint. Ok, I have

finally legal (not that i didn't happen a year ago or anything) and
 oh so casually suggested we go out to dinner or something. Hmmm... 
well, he is a great guy, a sweetie, treated me well in the past, HOTT, 
and a cop so that would get me out of trouble (not that it didn't 
before). I'm not gonna have to think hard about this. He's knows 
about the Texas situation and he's sympathetic. He was like ""i'm not
 askin you to marry me, just go out w/ me"". Ok, ok, so I'm weak, I 
said yes. the only problem is finding the time to do it. Saturday 
I'm spending the day w/ my mom for her b-day -n- Sunday I'm goin

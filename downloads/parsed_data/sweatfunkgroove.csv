You are independent, and would rather have a few good (and weird) friends than a lot of not-so-good ones. You may feel that people run down your eccentricity, but that's only because they're jealous.

"event","i'm starting to get nervous. my time here is limited. i have so many things to see and appreciate. mary tells me to think about it like everything i haven't seen i can see when i return. les and i met up with tomoko and michaela at a brazillian samba show that took us forever to find and it was raining and michaela had to take a tram and walk forever to find us. 
i had an urge to run across the bridge that i across everyday home from classes...i had this image of me spiriting, past everyone with my umbrella in my hand just dragging behind me like a scene from 'singin' in the rain' and i'm just running running running in the rain. 
at the concert, michaela and i were talking about the differences in american and european universities. she told me that i should just come back to prague for my graduate studies and that way i'll learn czech and all that...it sounded so nice, i told her that i'd actually been thinking about it. we drank and talked and it was a lovely evening. michaela told us about christmas carp and how they just sit in the streets by metro stops in huge tanks and czechs take them home and put them in the bathtub for three days. sometimes children get into the tub with the fish, the adults have to shower at a neighbor's house, and then someone eventually kills the fish, but it moves around for 2 hours after its been killed. czechs also have special fish transporters so the fish can swim around for the ride home. this whole conversation was absolutely hysterical, i promise you. i'm sad to think that i will probably miss this tradition in the czech republic. michaela says i should come back because her family is a perfect example of this tradition, except her dad buys the fish and gets it killed at the metro station instead of the bath tub thing, and there's always an argument because most of her family doesn't actually like carp. 
i'm starting a list of things i appreciate here that i'll miss:
1) czechs are terrible dancers, but they dance and throw their elbows out and kind of shuffle around knocking into people. i have yet to see a really good czech dancer that actually has rhythm. it's damn funny.
2) i realized that i always stand in the front of the tram because i love to see the other tram drivers do little waves to our tram driver. some people look really depressed and do these little hand-up gestures and others are almost militant about it, throwing up their hands proudly like a salute. i always look for it, and they all do it. i wonder if there's any drama between tram drivers and as a result they don't wave, or if there are just some really rude tram drivers who just look straight ahead (maybe they're shy). tram drivers aren't so nice actually, they don't wait for you most of the time and they will run you over, they will. 
sigh. 
mixed emotions about this...everything is confusion lately. more to come..."

i feel like i'm going to be sick. i stayed up until 9am this morning to watch the results come in. i'm just so physically disgusted with america right now that i'm almost shaking. i'm exhausted and sleeping has only woken me up to face this nightmare again.

"event","i just watched this gorgeous piece of animation, and of course, it is a Spanish film. 
i'm trying to get healthy. broth, tea, sleep, water, rest, etc.
i also have a crush on my class: the hottest and hippest Czech writers, anarchist and sprayer subcultures, street culture, reading of the streets and visual culture, punk rock, rock concerts, oral history interview, gender and queer studies, beer commercials/advertising, the velvet revolution, art-sex-american culture, psychedelic research, Buddhism, Anti-globalist movements, zines, the EU, anarchofeminists...
this class has the potential to be the best class i've ever taken. this woman doesn't seem like the type to teach this class at all, but it sounds so cool. jesus, she can't decide what she wants to focus on! i can so relate to this! that might be the only problem with the class, but i'm soooo excited.
also, i had a dream that i was hanging out in this guy's room and it was totally glass and all of these huge sea creatures were living inside the glass tanks. there was a giant seal swimming in the ceiling...then my teeth started to fall out and i tried to pick them up thinking that i might still be ok if i put them in again."

"event","Oh September, sweet September...

so it's day...i don't know, day eight or so here in praha, the golden city. i'm beginning to get sick which doesn't surprise me because before I left the doctor told me that I should be sick based on my conjunctivitis (eye infection). I've come to a few realizations today and i'll write them now...

1. Conjunctivitis, the eye infection that I've been suffering from is apparently also known as ""pink eye."" Yes, right, that same thing you had where you were a little kid. I did some research and apparently ""pink eye"" is a virus and is also a sexually transmitted disease. Most commonly, sexually active mothers spread the virus to their unborn children and the kids become infected need to stay in an incubator for several days before they leave the hospital. Amazing, right? I'm not sure how I aquired pink eye, it just sounds so silly to think of it as an STD. I think WebMD is nuts.

2. According to Chris, school starts at UCSB in ""a couple of weeks or so."" Damn sufer hippies.

3. I'm torn between who sings the very general soundtrack of my life: Otis Redding or Neil Young? Neil Young could be singing about puppies and it would sound sad though....And why am I thinking about America in Prague right now?

4. European eat so well. Even if I eat something heavy, I never feel sick.

5. (OK, for a Mona-Hole moment): The other night I had a dream about Bush and his evil minions and their horribly foul little children and how I felt powerless about the whole election situation and how these little kids were racist and their parents didn't care at all...I woke up crying. I feel like this dream has become reality and so many people are blinded and it fucking tears me apart. I think this also stems from incidents that took place on Saturday night with people from the program...

6. I think my cell phone is finally working...I had to take it to the cell phone service person who looked at me like an idiot and fixed it. 

7. Regarding #5, Andre 3000 was at the RNC and apparently people thought he was a Republican and his fans flipped out, he released a press statement saying that he isn't...do people know about this? I think some people I was with were angry because they didn't like that we were discussing an anti-Republican and that they didn't know who the anti-Republican was.

8. I find myself listening to romantic songs like the one above. I have my reasons. 

9. My thoughts are everywhere and scattered. I'm going out to clear my head and study for another Czech test."

is nikka costa down with d'angelo?

two of my favorite artists ever are on the same small label: cheeeba sound.

i knew this, but i thought i'd share it. 

cheeba sound rocks, although i don't know if it exists anymore since d'angelo is going off Okay Player and Nikka looks only to be on Virgin at this point. Odd yet again the labels, right? 

dream collaboration!?!

"event","the past few days have been some of the most special of my life. 
leaving. 
agus once told me that leaving is what humans do. we are together for only a short while and then we leave. sometimes we come back, but by then others will have left. sometimes we'll see each other in different places because we'll always share a little piece of time and being together makes us remember those times. mike says it's good that we're thrown everywhere throughout the world, it gives us reasons to travel. and also, the world is only so big. we're all alive together at this moment, that's what's important. through some collision of fate and enchantment, we ended up being alive together at the same time. what are the chances of that? 

it was great to go back ""home"" to Biko. I love that place, but it's time for a break. Hanging out with my precious Hole was just perfect. Miss Hulia summarizes it perfectly in her journal. My last night was spent giggling with her and Bryce as we looked through all my silly photos from freshman year. It was great to just live in that moment. Just after they left, Dorji, Mike, Kara and I hung out until 2, just laughing and being silly. Oh life, life. This has been quite a year for me. So many people, so many wonderful people. 

Well, i'm off to Prague soon. I'm getting packed and cleaning and tonight i'm going to stay with my mom and gramma up in Windsor. We'll eat Chinese food and maybe i'll tell them some of my secret secrets. 

Of course, girlie days at the lake hopefully next Monday! And give me your e-mails if you want me to include you in the mass e-mail regarding Prague...

immense love,
Allie

I am the only child
Sitting her among the leaves
As the sky burns like people trying to make fire
With their lovemaking,
As if two people rubbed together 
at precisely the right angle with the breeze blowing 
at 55 degrees NSW by 185 degrees SWE
could spark a flame that could 
burn this little house I grew up in
down to the ground
I did not ask for this
I asked for words and music,
stars dipped in chocolate 
good enough to eat
I did not ask for these feelings
But I'm stuck in between them like a piece of truth
jammed alongside lying teeth big enough to chew me alive."

"event","so i got back to sb yesterday. i took a shower at around 9:15pm, and kara called me at 10:30 about a party at dashain. after a little debate, i decide to go. i arrive and begin to drink. i didn't have that much, it was this fizzy white wine type stuff. i smoke a little, not too much tho...very normal for me.

i'm sitting at the table and suddenly everything gets distorted and fuzzy. i think something is wrong, very wrong. people start changing color and then the room starts to spin. the next thing i remember is everyone standing above me telling me that i fainted. I apparently fell off of a stool and onto this girl and then i fell on the ground and hit my head. 

when i came to, i started sweating and it was hard catching my breath. i had some water and sat on the couch and eventually kara walked me home. this morning i felt like i was going to throw up when i was standing by my closet. i called my mom at 5:45 and she told me to just go to work. i ate some food and i feel better.

something is not right about all this."

It's going to be set in a 21 hour window of time on a road trip from Lakeport to San Francisco. There are 7 kids in the car. Each one will get three hours during the night to tell their story. They will meet lots of people: expanding, shrinking, dividing, falling, loving, sexing, and crazy. There will be homosexuality, music, an appearence by my grandfather when he was a young man (Corky Roether), some drug use, youthful flowing, and maybe...i don't know. You'll have to read it. This is my love letter to San Francisco, to Marin, to Lakeport, to being young, to confusion, connection, poetry, night, and everything in between."

I.
The fields are quiet
I am the forgotten child
Who will find me here?

II.
Yes, your skin is soft
Hold me a little closer
This moment will fade

III.
Home whispers hello
Silence follows, heavy clouds
When will I return?"

We get off
Walk around the place as if we own it
Some do. Some don't, the posers.
We all get too drunk and smoke till our eyes want to close
That's how I feel now
I just want to close my eyes
Dream of other places and lives
For now I sit,
a ball of memory knotting my stomache.
What of this will I remember?
Not just the next day
when the train moves again towards 
the open expanse of FUTURE,
but when I leave
what part of me will remain in this place?
We shed ourselves gradually
let loose our skin for others,
try to keep a little,
hold onto a little for ourselves.
I want to wait for something
take some time
but that train pulls away
pulls ahead
and I don't know what I've left."

i'm feeling pretty good tho. i'm going to Prague in the fall, and then hopefully Washington DC to intern at the JFK Center for the Performing Arts. Uber cool beans. 

i'm also going to write a journal about my lovely trip to the South for my lyrics class. i'm very much looking forward to writing about the South. it really is where i need to move to.

i'm so tired. and i have this weird feeling going through my left side. i hope i'm not going to have a migrane or that something is wrong with my heart. 

now i'm going to have dinner with the most wonderful or wonderfulness, alice. i'm excited. 

ok...hope everyone else is managing a little better than myself.

i had 3.5 hours of sleep last night.

the night before that i had 4.5

i fell asleep with my large headphones on and almost didn't hear my alarm.

i wish i could go back to 5th grade. then maybe i would do things all a little bit differently."

OK, now I'm sounding like a cracked-out Anne Lamott reading at CCS. (So, to get from the cup to the masking tape you need to get there with no linolium showing, except as you're making your ways towards the masking tape, you come across a pen, and then next thing you know, the cup is falling in love with the linolium...) 

Oh, life. What are you to me right now? Chicago and jazz, fucking up horn lines and bad reeds, The Beatles and And it Stoned Me, lesbians and happy thoughts about penises, Whale Watching and Fishing Trips, Spring break and Ojai, co-op drama and manipulation, Rashmi and Kara, stubborn women who have more in common than they'd ever want to admit, sex and chocolate, chocolate sex, healing scars and misconceptions, hot santa barbara nights and stupid roomates, sore back and Leonard, the end and the beginning, love and loss, parents and siblings, money and fame, the endless search for naked sigmund freud with a picture of myself as a baby on the way back home we sang a song but our throats were getting dry, i feel better.

I'm tired and have too much to do to be writing this, but soon it will be spring break and i will be able to love this place again even tho i will be alone and empty, but not really because there are people who love me and people who love you and we will all be ok someday."

offer. But this revolution still has a long way to go, and you're not against making a
little profit while you wait. Honesty is your best policy.</font><br>

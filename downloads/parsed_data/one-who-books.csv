"event","Yesterday was awesome.





I had a biology project due.  It consisted of plants in a box.
I had to take my Geometry book.  It was heavy.
I had to go to school.  That sucked a little.
The result was me walking to school with the most awkward and heavy load of stuff ever.

First Period:  Geometry
I didn't even need the book.  I slept through that class.

Second Period:  World History Honors
I like movies.  We saw part of Schindler's List.  Not very much of it, though.  The school board doesn't like that movie.

Third Period:  Theater II
I helped Sarah (French girl Sarah) with her biology project.  Relatively uneventful.

A Lunch
I got cookies!

Fourth Period:  Biology Honors
I was the only person who actually turned the project in.
We saw an episode of the Magic School Bus!  I found it funny that I had a tape of that episode at one point.

Fifth Period:  Art II Electronic Media
Pixel art is fun, but it is such a pain.

Sixth Period:  English II Honors
A li'l bit of writing.  A li'l bit of reading.  A li'l bit of coloring.

Thespian Meeting
Officer delegate nominations.  Not very interesting.

After Thespian Meeting
It is now me, Christian, and Stephanie.
We walked to my house.
It was hot and that book still made stuff heavy.

At My House
We had to go through the back door because I seem to have lost my key (that fact gets fun later).
We watched various Monty Python skits.  That was pretty awesome.
Then Sarah got there.  I had never met/seen/spoke to her before in my life.  She seemed pretty fun.
More Monty Python.
Pizza!
Tickets!

Ride To U of H
Dad referred to Evanescence as ""he"".  People were confused.

At U of H
We're walking to Cullen

At Cullen
There are signs that say ""MUSE"".  Confirmation!
We initially went through the wrong door.  Whoops.
They gave us free posters
I gave a dude some tickets.  He was annoyingly slow whilst dealing with them.
I looked at the merchandise they were selling.  Shirts were terribly expensive.  I bought one.
Stephanie bought a wristband.
Christian bought himself and Sarah shirts.

In the Theater
I seriously had to go to the bathroom.  I waited, though.
Cullen is a pretty fun theater.  A fantastic place for a concert.
We were there early.  There weren't many other people there yet.
The anticipation was crazy.

Razorlight
The opening act.  They were pretty good.  You could tell that they were new, but that's part of what I liked about them.
I still had to pee.

Between the Shows
I went to the bathroom.  Quite a relief.
More anticipation.  Worse than before.

Muse
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At about the second song, I was really starting to freak out.
The lighting was incredible.
It was actually played well (not so usual for a rock concert).
Matt Bellamy's piano was more than a little awesome.
Stephanie kept moving people towards the aisle.  I had to follow.
At one point, I was used as support for Stephanie jumping.
Christian was looking at me funny and I laughed.
Nothing was smashed.  It was sad.

Post-Muse
We were there for maybe a little more than half an hour after the concert waiting for a ride.
Stephanie kept losing her poster.

Ride From Cullen
Christian is a terrible flirt and he doesn't even know it.  I find that funny.
We went to McDonalds.  I'm never too fond of it, but I'll take what I can get.

Home Kinda
I had no key.
The doors were locked.
It was fun.
I rang the doorbell.  Nobody answered.
I rang it many times after that.....  still no answer.
Christian pulled out his cellphone.  We called the inside of my house from the outside of my house.

Home (better this time)
I slept."

"event","In accordance with the recent trend (Hi, Rainey!), I shall relay last night's dream unto you all.

The dream was mostly in third person.

     It began with a fat kid.  He was perfectly healthy in most respects, but he still happened to be morbidly obese.  He was also a mean fat kid.  His personality was very akin to Dudley Dursley (for those who know not who this is, I am terribly sorry for you).
     Whenever he had anything wrong with him, his mother had her own special way of treating it.  I don't remember what this treatment was, but I rememer its effects upon the fat one.  He would start laughing uncontrollably and would suddenly break out with hives.  His laughs were more like a baby giggling than anything else.
     One day, his mother decided to bring him to a doctor.  The doctor did all the normal stuff that doctors do, but then he decided to do something special for this specific patient.  It just happened to be the fat kid's mother's ""special treatment"".  Surely enough, the kid began giggling uncontrollably and breaking out with hives.  The doctor saw something seriously wrong with this (I would have) and prescribed more treatment.  The doctor sent the fat kid to some island to be treated, and the only way to get there was by plane.  The only plane available was very old and very large.  The trip was long.
     The captain of the plane was only about as old as the fat kid, and much smaller.  This is where the fat one's bullying instincts start to kick in.  He tries and tries to pick on the captain, but can never quite get there.
     At some point, someone tells the fat one that the captain wanted to see him.  When he asked ""Where?"" he as pointed to an ominous-looking flight of stairs.
     At this point, there is a perspective change.  I am now seeing through the eyes of the fat kid.
     I (as the fat one) descend the flight of stairs to find myself in a room of doors.  Every part of this room that could have a door had a door.  It was all black.  I didn't know what door to pick, so I picked randomly.
     The door I picked was blocked by debris, so I moved it (I think there was a piano in there somewhere).  Then I went inside.  I start to hear people whispering as soon as I get there.
     They are whispering things that sound like ""Why did he choose suicide?""
     After a few seconds of this, I start to freak out.
     I didn't like where this was going, so at this point I woke myself up."

Interesting.  I never knew I looked like that.

I do enjoy a good bit of JPop every once in a while, though."

Me, Brad, and maybe someone else are planning on holding a Monty Python / Disney movie marathon on thursday.  That should be pretty fun."

"event","Today was quite fun.  We went over to Klein Forest, set up, did our thing, and got notes.

The guy said that the production, as a whole, was good.  He said that our main weakness was character development.  I quite agree.

Afterwards, we ate lunch.  Dominos pizza has that 555 deal, so i pitched in 5 bucks and got a whole pizza to myself.  I didn't eat it all, of course, but I could have if i so chose."

I get to wear a poofy shirt!  That's always fun."

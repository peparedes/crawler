Well other than that I've been doing well. I work pay bills and have a brew once in a while I even hardly ever smoke. Fucking cigs though man I need to quit... my lungs feel like shit. I can't breathe when I wake up. Its time to quit well...anyway I have to go so if youse a true friend give me a call I miss all of you and there are some people who I really ought to talk to again because they are some of the most amazing people so I ask the Tina, Bridge, Criag and Leeat give me a call sometime because I miss talking to all of you and I feel lost without all of you in my life.

Between becoming shoprites bitch and having all my friends turn their backs on me because of rumors man this shits been unreal...not to mention the bullshit pregnancy scare I had just cuz some dumb bitch was jealous and wanted me to be with her. Well anyway since this has become my life I guess I should just accept it and be grateful but I don't really want to I feel tied down again and think that I'll be moving on soon enough to where I don't know but anywhere beats not having friends or being able to have fun."

Always longing for your kiss
Life seems so hard without you
Can't undo what I've done
and the pain I've caused you is very real
but under it all I desire another 
chance to woo your heart and hold you in my arms
I still can't believe I lost you
that I let my own demons get in the way
of my love for you
for all the yelling, fighting and pain I inflicted
I'm so sorry and I hope that one day
you can find it in your heart to forgive me
and who knows when you do maybe I'll 
finally have gotten over you."

"event","Come on come on
I see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself, 
""Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?""
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black. 
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.
Cops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero. 
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare. 
First ship 'em dope & let 'em deal the brothers. 
Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other. 
""It's time to fight back"", that's what Huey said. 
2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead. 
I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere 
unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes.
Learn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers. 
And that's how it's supposed to be. 
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? 
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids, 
but things change, and that's the way it is. 

[Bridge w/ changing ad libs]

(Come on, come on) That's just the way it is. Things'll never be the same. 
That's just the way it is. aww yeah...
[Repeat]

I see no changes. All I see is racist faces. 
Misplaced hate makes disgrace for races we under.
I wonder what it takes to make this one better place... 
let's erase the wasted.
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right. 
'Cause mo' black than white is smokin' crack tonight.
And only time we chill is when we kill each other. 
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other. 
And although it seems heaven sent, 
we ain't ready to see a black President, uhh. 
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact... 
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks. 
But some things will never change. 
Try to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game. 
Now tell me what's a mother to do? 
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you. 
You gotta operate the easy way. 
""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way. 
Sellin' crack to the kids. ""I gotta get paid,"" 
Well hey, well that's the way it is. 

[Bridge]
[Talking:]

We gotta make a change... 
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes. 
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live 
and let's change the way we treat each other. 
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do 
what we gotta do, to survive. 

And still I see no changes. Can't a brother get a little peace? 
There's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East. 
Instead of war on poverty, 
they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me. 
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do. 
But now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up. 
You gotta learn to hold ya own. 
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone. 
But tell the cops they can't touch this. 
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this. 
That's the sound of my tune. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool. 
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped & I never get to lay back. 
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs. 
Some buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years. 
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh

[Bridge 'til fade]
Some things never change. 


aight I know I'm not black or anything but this song rings so true for me right now I had to put it here. Well beyond that I'm going to visit the one and only Kristen today. This shold be fun as hell."

The best part is I've known this girl since she was little then she turns around and pins it all on me. Fucking dumb cunt. As well as her father is now looking for my boy and I. How much more can this shit get fucked up. All I have to look foreward to is not being in Bergenfield for a while. I have buisness I must attend to and I want it to go smooothly so I can begin making more money. Well whatever, besides that women fucking suck. They are a complete waste of time. They can't make up their minds on anything and they just sit there teasing and luring people on.Why can't they just be normal fucking humans. Now whenever I make comments about people in general some of my friends tend to think I mean them. In this case I will specifically say that this does not apply to Tina or Bridge. However there are other women in my life who this does apply to and they if for some reason read this will know who they are. well thats enough for the moment peace."

"event","Aight so lets see. I've been dumped. Kicked out my crib. And am joining the military. Wow what an interesting two weeks its been. But anyway I'm not in a delightful mood cuz I hate people who say one thing to my face then do the opposite. Their scumbags. I hate niggaz who want to pretend to be my boyz but then they turn out to be bitches. But most of all I hate people who say they want to be friends then don't act like it. Friends are loyal not this stupid ass shit where there loyal so long as their comfortable. But then again thats what you get when you talking bout bitches. I have learned a very big lesson though when it boils down to it pretty much every girl is a ho. A great big hairy cock sucking ho. I think I can count on two hands the number of people I like and care about. However, the more I see how certain people are the more I realize how small that numbers beginning. Frankly, I'm sick of being backstabbed and next time it happens someone may jus git stabbed. Since I am the slasher of Bergenfield and all. Aight whatever don't know wherre that all came from but I like it so its staying here and if you got a problem man up and say something bitches."

"event","OK...here is the simplest way to put something, Life is all about pleasure. Yet, we are told never to seek such pleasures. Why? Simply because the religions of the world do not allow for humans to be what they are, animals. Yes, I said it...we are animals pure and simple creatures who want nothing more than to fuck the next broad/dude, do drugs, drink, smoke, do whatever we want without any limits...Then why do we allow ourselves to be kept under all these rules and regulations that prohibit what we desire as the bestial creatures we are. Because no one person has the balls to stand up to the system and keep fighting it thats why...we all do it when we're younger at least a majority of people do...I'd say anywhere from the ages of 13-25 we attempt to do as much as we can that makes us different from the rest of society...we push ourselves, we do not sleep for days, we injest more drugs than anyone else, we drink more, and we have more random and meaningless sex than anybody will ever admit too. However, after 25 we settle down. Why?? Because our society tells us we have to that we're allowed our fun but then its time to become a settle down...I say fuck that...I will always work jobs that just get me by...I will never allow myself to be suckered into anything else that really doesn't matter...you think the ""grown-up"" world will do anything for you...It won't it'll leave you more empty than any drug, sex, bottle, orreligion will...People sacrafice their hopes and dreams for what? For Nothing...they do so beacause they believe they have no other option...that they have to hold a steady job rather than write that book they want to or they stop singing because they lose faith in themselves...Thats the most important part of Life is faith in onesself to actually accomplish and achieve what we desire...Hedonism is not the answer but if a man/woman desires to do something worthwhile, something they believe is what they want to do with their life than there should never be anything to ever stand in their way. All this garbage about how life is some fucking journey...no life is about achieving our hopes and dreams without us sacraficing them to some established order bullshit...so in other words FUCK YOU ALL... I'm not going to be a worthless bum but I'm not going to allow any of you from stopping me from doing what I love and from having my book published. That is all."

(You dont wanna be like me) 
[Monoxide Child]
I can walk on water and freeze it on step one 
And then I'll stick my finger in it and melt it like it was hot sun 

[Jamie Madrox]
Well I can turn your adam's apple into apple juice 
Start to strangle mothafuckas till their face turn blue 

[Monoxide Child]
I can be the world's greatest serial killer of all time 
And I'll end your fucking life at the drop of a dime 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can float above the clouds, way up in the sky 
And it's my choice if I live or die 

[Monoxide Child]
Or I can be the strange pizza man that always knocks twice 
And when you open up your door I give your mothafucking neck a slice 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can take a million dollars and just throw it away 
Cause it'll never replace a single ounce of my sanity 

[Monoxide Child]
I can be the last angel standing on top of the hill 
Or the green demon waiting on your window sill 

[Jamie Madrox]
And I can become an icon for the oppressed 
Cause their hearts still beating in their unforgiven chest 

[Chorus x2]
You Don't wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like 
You Don't Wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like 
And this is the mind of a serial killa 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can buy a shotgun from Target with attempts to set it off 
I can load that bitch in the parking lot and shoot that shit off 

[Monoxide Child]
And I can be the book of the dead, a vampire or a demon 
But either way your fucked, cause when I leave your not breathing 

[Jamie Madrox]
Well I can part the sea with the wand of a wizard 
And turn a hot day into a windy blizzard 

[Monoxide Child]
I can be an axe in the backs of people who wanna trash talk 
And leave your body slaughtered all over your momma's sidewalk 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can disappear into the air like a phantom in the night 
And I can die if I'm exposed to excessive sunlight 

[Monoxide Child]
And I can show you how to dig a bitches grave in less then 20 seconds 
And I'll shove that bitch in there and let her family get to guessing 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can grab you out of your world and show you horrible things 
And I can show you the terror that curiosity brings 

[Monoxide Child]
And I can be the last straw, that puts you over the edge 
And leaves eleven at your work place dead 

[Chorus x2]
You Don't wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like 
You Don't Wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like

I took the test and can get any muthafucking job I want. Howver, I have to go back in two weeks cuz I am 45 lbs. overweight but I might have to go back later than that if I test positive for drugs. Its all good though either way I will be sworn in sometime before the holidays. In other news, Life is good. My friends are with me, my girl is by my side, and I know that no matter what happens they will always be here with me. I know the heading said goood times but I must also drop one thing in here jus cuz of the date.

Aight short and sweet. Whats good ya'll? Life's funny ain't it. You find people and things you would never want to give up for the world but jus at the point where you are going to have to give everything up in order to live. Huh? I don't know why but somehow it all seems ok now. I don't really want to join the navy and if I could find somewhere to live and a place to work near my friends it would be wonderful. However, since that does not seem possible at this moment in time I am going to sit here and just entertain myself till I have to go. Well, that seems to be that although I do feel the unrequited need to post the names of the new and improved Family and say wassup to my homies:

"event","I want everybody listening now to say this
Twiztid is the muthafucking shit
And everybody else who feels that I'm a little out of line
Come see me when you hitting rewind and you will find
That I'm an ex-con serial killa axe wielding for real-a big gorilla
As I walk in the shadow of death
I bitch slap his ass and then I light a cigarette
I told you all I'm addicted to drugs and weird sex
And putting holes in the back of your neck carnival reject
Respect like you do to don dada when you see me give your boy a holler
Got the world in a shock collar like a rotweiler on the loose 
Running trains on your girls caboose
Don't believe in the truce we gonna fight until somebody here dies
I been here since 1865 and no lies

[Chorus]
This is the story of our lives
Come and take a look at my eyes
Keep it real and tell me no lies
We've been waiting for you
Here we go
This is the story of our lives
Come and take a look at my eyes
Keep it real and tell me no lies
We've been waiting for you

[Jamie Madrox]
We came through the door kicking that bitch off the hinge
We was knocking but wouldn't nobody let us in
It's the incredible edible white chocolate rappers
We came on the scene busting the cabbage patch backwards
D-I-T-Z-I-W-T we were born connected at the hip like Siamese twins
We coming out with the underground sound 
And one finger on each hand and you can count them

[Monoxide]
Fuck everybody here man it's not about them
And tucked inside of my bag is a problem
Underground feel the ground shake
Feel it vibrate watch your girl gyrate
We can move the whole world if we choose
But instead we kick the wickedest blues
And I refuse to lose the demographic of the people
Who choose to put there hearts inside the black magic

[Chorus]
This is the story of our lives
Come and take a look at my eyes
Keep it real and tell me no lies
We've been waiting for you
Here we go
This is the story of our lives
Come and take a look at my eyes
Keep it real and tell me no lies
We've been waiting for you

[Jamie Madrox]
We write voodoo sayings on the fronts of t-shirts
So that when people read 'em they will become creatures
Twiztid still coming with the ultra man flow
That'll linger in your brain and constantly echo
We ain't in it to be rich we're in it to reach folks
And change life and put you up on shit you ain't know
That's about it you're in the midst of some maniacs
Who will unload a microphone on your dome as if it's a gat
So conceal the unreal if the fruit is mass appeal
We're the worms eating our way from under the apple peal
With all juice and no pulp fiction
No dollar ninety nine a minute for our predictions
We smash mics like with the rhymes we recite
Keep this mutha fucka hype from now till sunlight
Now do you really need a shovel to dig it
And with a flip of a coin we can be righteous or wicked

[Chorus]
This is the story of our lives
Come and take a look at my eyes
Keep it real and tell me no lies
We've been waiting for you
Here we go
This is the story of our lives
Come and take a look at my eyes
Keep it real and tell me no lies
We've been waiting for you

We've been waiting for you 

We've been waiting for you 

We've been waiting for you 

We've been waiting for you 

I've come to the realization that I'm out of options and of time.  I'm not left with a whole hell of alot.
This shits wack. Whoever would think I'd be longing for the days back on the street etching out a living that made me hard. I sold my soul, smoked weed and drank. That shits cool and all but I have nothing to do now my options are left to the navy and the guard. Neither of which I really want to do. I jus wanna make some bills and chill illin style like we used to. For now I'm limited to using song lyrics to express my views so the first is good and the second one here is better expressing how I'm feeling and how I need to get away
""U Don't Wanna B Like Me""
(You dont wanna be like me) 
[Monoxide Child]
I can walk on water and freeze it on step one 
And then I'll stick my finger in it and melt it like it was hot sun 

[Jamie Madrox]
Well I can turn your adam's apple into apple juice 
Start to strangle mothafuckas till their face turn blue 

[Monoxide Child]
I can be the world's greatest serial killer of all time 
And I'll end your fucking life at the drop of a dime 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can float above the clouds, way up in the sky 
And it's my choice if I live or die 

[Monoxide Child]
Or I can be the strange pizza man that always knocks twice 
And when you open up your door I give your mothafucking neck a slice 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can take a million dollars and just throw it away 
Cause it'll never replace a single ounce of my sanity 

[Monoxide Child]
I can be the last angel standing on top of the hill 
Or the green demon waiting on your window sill 

[Jamie Madrox]
And I can become an icon for the oppressed 
Cause their hearts still beating in their unforgiven chest 

[Chorus x2]
You Don't wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like 
You Don't Wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like 
And this is the mind of a serial killa 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can buy a shotgun from Target with attempts to set it off 
I can load that bitch in the parking lot and shoot that shit off 

[Monoxide Child]
And I can be the book of the dead, a vampire or a demon 
But either way your fucked, cause when I leave your not breathing 

[Jamie Madrox]
Well I can part the sea with the wand of a wizard 
And turn a hot day into a windy blizzard 

[Monoxide Child]
I can be an axe in the backs of people who wanna trash talk 
And leave your body slaughtered all over your momma's sidewalk 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can disappear into the air like a phantom in the night 
And I can die if I'm exposed to excessive sunlight 

[Monoxide Child]
And I can show you how to dig a bitches grave in less then 20 seconds 
And I'll shove that bitch in there and let her family get to guessing 

[Jamie Madrox]
I can grab you out of your world and show you horrible things 
And I can show you the terror that curiosity brings 

[Monoxide Child]
And I can be the last straw, that puts you over the edge 
And leaves eleven at your work place dead 

[Chorus x2]
You Don't wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like 
You Don't Wanna be like (Me) 
Don't wanna be like 
And this is the mind of a serial killa 

You 
Me 
You 
And this is the mind of a serial killa 
You 
Me 
You 
And this is the mind..."

You are elegant, withdrawn, and brilliant.
Your mind is a weapon, able to solve any puzzle.
You are also great at poking holes in arguments and common beliefs.

For you, comfort and calm are very important.
You tend to thrive on your own and shrug off most affection.
You prefer to protect your emotions and stay strong.</font></td></tr></table>

Won't you listen?

When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you, for your surprise
you introduced me, to my mind
And left me wanting, you and your kind

I love you, Oh you know it

My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear

Come on now, try it out

Straight people don't know, what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
you gave to me a new belief
and soon the world will love you sweet leaf

"event","Today's scent is <b>Fallen</b> - Cherubic white sandalwood and golden musk with a dark halo of amber, a breath of imperial florals, unbending woods, and the shadow cast by vetiver and violet.

I like it all right, but it's faint. On the bright side, the florals aren't overpowering. I'm going to try it again - right now my skin is soaking up everything it can because of the dryness outside, so nothing lasts for long. 

Also, <b>The Dodo</b> is very much in my swap pile. The only way to describe that one is ""If Schizophrenia had a scent"" - it's this odd, inconstant and not entirely pleasant mishmash of all sorts of perfume notes, not one of which gets along especially well on my skin. I wish luck to anyone else willing to try it."

"event","Today's BPAL: The name translates to the beautiful woman without mercy, and is the title of an old French court poem that was later revamped by John Keats. A bewitching, seductive scent, rife with mystery and foreboding. 

There are no listed notes for this on the main site, and I'm too lazy to go find it in the forums (www.bpal.org).  It's a dry, dusty-to-powder scent on me, that isn't helped at ALL by the fact the southern half of my state of residence is covered in ash and smells like an autumn bonfire.

Or that it's 90 degrees outside, so now it's a dry, dusty scent mixed with sweat. Yummers. 

x.x I think this one's a swapper - I feel like an old lady's wardrobe wearing it."

Just like the description says - it's a bit spicy, but there's a soft sweetness to it. The jasmine in this doesn't become overwhelmingly perfume-y like it does in other blends.  I really rather like it, and I think this may end up on my 5ml wishlist."

I've cranked out something like <b>220 single-spaced pages</b> of the same story, and it's not finished yet. [The margins are set to .75"" on all sides, to boot - there's technically <i>more</i> per page than average.]  Of course, the word 'story' here is something vague and indicates what one could loosely define as an ongoing narrative moreso than a cohesive plotline sort of novel, but I'm having fun writing it, so I suppose that has to count for *something*. (I'll add as an aside that while I understand the need for cohesiveness in writing, I also realize that to some extent, the narrative format is rather like a wordy imitation of real life, and real life doesn't have neat plot twists and a denoument. So... When I write for my own entertainment, I tend to mean it.)

[Certain people are allowed to see it, if they REALLY want to, I suppose, but the caveat of ""I don't wanna hear about it"" stands nonetheless. Like it, hate it, but keep it to yourself. I don't have thick skin on this subject.]"

"event","One of these days, I'm going to get over this stupid fascination with romance novels. Because the likelihood I'll ever figure out how to experience the sort of thing they describe in purple prose and rosy tones - that likelihood is VERY slim. 
I guess I just keep hoping that one of these days, I'll have as much in common with the last 200 pages of Rachel Gibson's 'I'm In No Mood For Love' as I do the first hundred. That the story of my life won't keep cycling through the nagging sense of unfulfilled everything like it does now, and that my ugliness as a child won't keep influencing me as an adult. That the one time I accepted a marriage proposal, he turned out to be questionably not-straight. That there is a difference between being touched and being <i>touched</i>, and nerve endings can fire at levels more pleasant and complex than 'ouch' and 'huh?'. That being touched as a woman will someday be not-painful, and god forbid, pleasant.
Of course, this hope is also strung along by the unsteady-at-best conviction that I'm not somehow <i>emotionally</i> crippled, either, that I won't always have to delude myself to believe in love or that I might be in-love (because I <i>should</i> be and not because I <i>am</i>), that it IS out there, and that is is attainable. That it's something more intense and interesting than passing fancy or a mild interest. All of that. 
Maybe there's something wrong with holding myself against the standard of ""trashy"" novels, but the concept of Happily Ever After is certainly long-standing enough that there must be a grain of truth in it somewhere (let's not delve into the deeper philosophies of the story ending at marriage, for now). 

I just wish it weren't so damned hard to FIND."

"event","So, the first week of Japanese class is going well. It's 99% review, but it's review I need (like kanji and grammar...).

It's damned odd to feel like one of the oldest people in the room, though. Most everyone else in the class is anywhere from 18-20ish. I've found a desk buddy in a very cynical young woman, so it's a mixed blessing - she hates the teacher's ""accent"" (non-Japanese speaking Japanese) and comments upon it constantly, and is always bored, but at the same time, doesn't know enough of the language to proceed. It's an aggravating mix, no doubt. [We've at least come to the compromise that we'll use the grammar presented to make up absurd sentences of our own.] 

Humanities is tonight, and while I have misgivings about taking a 3-unit survey class in addition to a 5-unit language course, unless there are numerous essays (unlikely - even Oxy only had 2-3 major essays per class), I should be able to swing it. It means work 5 days a week and class 4 nights a week including Tea, but I think the hardest part is the driving time, not the actual lessons or homework. Even the late hours aren't too bad, if I remember to go to bed shortly after I get home.  

Sadly, the hardest class so far is the Intro to Insurance class I'm taking *at work* - because it's pretty much reading a chapter at a time in overview, and then listening to a teleconferenced lecture for an hour and a half. No homework to speak of besides the (VERY BORING) reading, and only one exam at the end for a <i>basic</i> designation to add to my email signature if I pass. 

At least the office covers the cost of the Intro class, because after looking at my credit card statement... OUCH. BIG OUCH.

Straight Vit. E oil on all my old and newer scars seems to be doing at least a little good, not to mention helping the raw spots on my face heal (haaaaaate acne).&nbsp; And all REALLY affordable, other than the Aveeno (I have yet to find a discount alternative that's available at the corner drugstore). <br/><br/><br/>Tonight, I just may try the aspirin facial.

Wash off with warm water.) It's supposed to be good for bumps, lumps, and blackheads, and waaaaaaaaaay cheaper than buying acne products [a buck a bottle of aspirin versus 5 bucks for a scrub, 10 for a cream, etc...] Another trick is plain white toothpaste to dry out trouble spots - dab it on like any spot treatment cream, let dry.

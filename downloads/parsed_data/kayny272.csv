"event","so i have a fever...awesome. 

the cu vs. csu game was sick yesterday. a lot of fun. i pregamed with ryan jess and ilana, went to the game with ryan and then went to a bunch of parties with brent. it was cool.

i was so sick today though, all ive done is watch family guy and read in bed. 

jess ilana and nora went out tonight, but i just chilled with jack in his room and talked for like two hours. hes great. i probably had more fun getting to know him than if i had gone out with the girls. 

i wish i had more/better girl friends here. all my friends are guys. and im close with all the guys here, but other than that i just have jess and ilana and i am nothing like them. i miss jen, nikki, steph and allison the most. i was talking to jack about how much i miss jen because no one here understands me like her. i told him the story about us trying to study for ap euro and all the crazy things we used to make up, he thought it was funny. jack is the most like my friends from home, i can always have a good laugh around him. but still if i broke out the german accent, he would just make fun of me instead of doing it along with me like my friends would. 

ok im going to do another entry in a few mins with pics."

I'm in a very complacent mood at the moment. I've just been sitting in my room, listening to jewel and reading The Rule of Four. I can't seem to put it down. I know, it's Thirsty Thursday, and I should be out partying and living up the college scene, but right now what I'm doing is so much more appetizing. 

We have a three day weekend coming up, which will be nice. And I booked my plane tickets to come home october 1st for fall break. Which will be nice.

Umm other than that, I have nothing to say. 

I dont need anyone."

"event","eh. so im bored out of my mind. 

already got one strike just for being in the same room where some people were smoking up. awesome. so now i have to be uber careful that i dont get caught in the same room with anything else. or ill get kicked out of school. awesome. classes havent even started yet. wtf. 

whatever. i need to make new friends. the girls across the hall from ny are tolerale, but, they arent even like me at all. they didnt understand my ""i leave bite marks"" stickers, and they just dont have the same confidence as my friends at home. one of them i think is really pretty, but shes soooo insecure, and thats just not my style. 

i want to get to know the cali guys down the hall better. they seem more similar to my friends back home, they exude an air of confidence, and one of them was wearing a pink man tailored shirt...how hot. they were nice, so maybe ill stroll on down to their room later today and make some new friends. 

other than that. umm lets see, classes start tomarrow, i have pre calc, then latin and then mcdb. ill be done by 1. pretty easy day. i have to see if im even in the precalc class yet. im waitlisted, spot #2, so i have to go to the class until i get in. i hope i do. i need the credits. 

ummmmm im still not sure if i want to rush or not. it starts the 26th, idk im thinking i might meet more people like my friends at home, but then again they might just be a bunch of annoyingly superficial girls. its going to be really hard to find other girls like jen and i. we have confidence, but we also have depth. its a hard combo to come by. shittttt im not going to have any friends here, am i?

whatever, its all good."

az was a blast. despite the high concentration of pmsing going on, it was all good. lots of relaxing, sitting by the pool, being waited on. its the life. im a real nice golden color now and my hair is soooo much blonder. awesome. 

um theres not much to update on i guess. i leave in 7 days for boulder ;-\ im a little sad about it right now.

and im getting my wisdom teeth pulled wednesday, so thats really going to put a damper on my last few days home. 

i really suck at good byes so maybe i just wont do it. i think im just going to pack up and leave and im sure no one would notice, so theres no long drawn out upsetting emotional good byes, which just plain suck.

"event","""there are two things i know for sure, that i love you, and that i need you in my life."" 

....that made my night. sweetest thing he could have said, and something i really truely needed to hear. <3 

the realization that i'm leaving for good has really started to sink in. and i seem to cry at the slightest things that i know i will miss. i really only have 7 days of home time left. 7 days to say goodbye, 7 days to pack my stuff, 7 days to enjoy anytime of being home and with the few people i might miss. 

leaving for arizona in a day. very excited, yet very bitter sweet considering the fact that its taking away 10 days that i could have used to relish in homeness. but it will be a nice get away with two best friend whom i will miss dearly. but i just wish i could be bringing my family and aaron along with me, so that this trip wasn't taking so much time away from them. i almost feel guilty going. but i do need it. i need the vacation, esspecially to get my mind off it all. 

for the past four years, i couldn't wait to get out of here. theres nothing here for me. but its really a lot harder than it sounds. im an emotional wreck lately, and i know it will be short lived, but for now, im actually a little depressed about leaving home. the feeling of excited curiosty about the furture is being surpressed by nostalgia to stay a child forever. wishing i was 7 again and forever. no problems, no worries. it would be nice, wouldnt it?

haha well comment and tell me how much youll miss me once im gone. ha, id love to see the nasty remarks ill get for that one."

"event","so last night, jen gets drunk at like 8, at her house, by herself. so i go pick her up and we end up going out with aaron and brandon and ""tallpaleblackhair"" and that whole crew. and we end up back at brandons house, just to leave like 2 mins later. 

so whatever we all go home around 11:30 because we're bored out of our minds and tired. thennnnn, mark calls jen. so she DRAGS ME OUT. (i was very very pissed) and we went to the bay club to hangout with mark, drew, 2 kids from CT ....and yeah. we play beer pong, and we absolutely SUCKED AT IT. so the two kids from CT won that game. but i got pretty tipsy. and mark was throwing up the whole time, from the time we got there, till we left. 

it was pretty random, but fun i guess? i dont know, just something to do. i went to bed with the spins. ugh. 

its a nice day out, i should have gone to the beach, but i have soooo much to do before arizona, so maybe jen and i will just lay out by the pool today, so im not disgustingly pale for az. 

oh, i almost forgot. i went to the shooting range yesterday with aaron and all those guys. and i had the best ""grouping"" out of all the guys (which included a Marine)!!!!! grouping meaning like my 3 shots were closest together. awesome, go me. everyone should be very very scared. 

haha aaron said i should get a gun because i was sooo good. um, no thank you? lol

"event","last night was nothing special, saw steph and allison for a little. then had car problems and aaron and chad came to my rescue, then lil v's with the guys. normal night. 

this weather really sucks, i want to go to the beachhhhhh

theres really nothing new, i went out to lunch with steph and allison today, always fun. i watched scary movies with aaron all morning, very typical.

thats about it. 

right now life is seriously just a waste of time until i go to colorado, i feel like all im doing is waiting for the time to go by. its a sucky feeling, i should be living it up for the last month im home, but im just sitting around waiting for august 17th to come along...i should really do something about that."

"event","soooo, im really bored. im so bummed that its raining out, i was supposed to go to the beach with steph. oh well, maybe tomarrow. 

i just got back from orientation at CU Boulder. i LOVED it, met some really awesome people and some not so awesome peole (everyone from texas), but over all it was a great time. i made my schedual from next year, which pretty much sucks, im taking:
 + latin 1
 + physics 
 + micro organisms, plagues and virus's
 + advanced writing 1250

hm, ok so maybe it isn't so bad, except for the physics part. i was really pissed that EVERY art and art history class was full, and all the good classic's classes were full too. so sad. oh well, maybe ill get some good classes next symester. 

im leaving in two and a half weeks for arizona with jen and nik. i cant wait to be tan. and then im leaving for boulder on august 17th. and somewhere in between all that i want to go to newport, maine and maybe shelter island. i'll have to see what i can squeeze in, i really dont have much time. 

i went to the yankee vs tampa bay game yesterday with jen, it was fun, VERY hot though. yanks won, of coarse.

ok well im off to pick aaron up and go watch some scary movies, perfect for this rainy day."

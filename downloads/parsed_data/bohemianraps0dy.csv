"event","yesterday was fun. i FINALLY got off work, and hung out with emily for a little bit. we went to dirksen park and had a great time. then we went over to davids house and hung out with him for a while. we played the matching game that you play as a little kid, but with drinking. that was fun. emily had to go home for her bday dinner alex and zack were over at his house, and his brothers girlfriend. she kept fighting with alex...which was dumb but her and her friend left.
alex took me to get stevie and me and stevie met ben to give him money to pick up in canton for me. we went back over to davids. taylor and his friend came over too, and mike hazen. alex and taylor took us to the apartment to get eleanor and my stuff. we were all just hanging out and i walked to my sisters house without anyone knowing. 
stevie got really worried then mad. i feel bad for upsetting her, but im glad everything is ok now. stevies mom was dumb so alex drove my car to take her home. then emily came over again., we smoked and hung out. alex was really nice, i liked him. then everyone left. me and emily went to the apartment and smoked even more. i was really messed up. i feel bad because i barely hung out with jason and ben before i passed out. but i merely couldnt handle it.

for todays agenda, im going out with my family (ew)
then hopefully hanging out with stevie and possibly emily
and hanging out with jason for sure.






i feel really good about everything. im separating my clothes in preparation for the move.
it finally feels like its really going to happen."

"event","im not hiding away anymore because it does nothing for me but cause problems.
let me just tell you that right now.
i enjoyed hiking.
me and jason fought a little, but talked again and i think it helped.
slowly but surely im becoming a more open person.
i dont know if thats a good thing or not.
i think i m more optimistic also.

hiking made me miss megan and brittany.
i do miss them.
the way things are sucks.

things are starting to frighten me.
i move in twenty six days...

my dad took basically stole three hundred dollars from me, and now i have to pay another three hundred so my car can be insured.
bye bye trip to chicago.
now ambers mad at me, 
matt will be disappointed, my aunts will be upset and i dont get to meet jenni.
damnit.
i think things with jason will be ok. we're still only talking, but after everything i just wanna forget this stuff ever happened.
i have to start packing for school, it really makes me sad yet excites me at the same time.
i dont feel like hanging out with anyone.
ive been told to stay at my house by my mom because ive been so upset.



i m startin to feel like i used to, last summer. when things were really bAD.
i need to avoid a repeat of that.
people i thought i knew are pathetic.
it makes me really sad that me and brittany are the way we are now.
thats not what i wanted.



this summer is basically the opposite of everything i thought it would be.
i just want one person to come home,
and i want my life to start putting itself together.


im jealous of how everyone else feels. i know ive been flaky this week.
stevie and aaron: i love you. thank you for everything, i just have been home."

There's too much stuff around 
The bus groaned along 
You put your hand upon the window 
The town 
And I thought 
You look just fine to me 
You look just fine to me 
You look just fine to me 
Shall we liquefy 
Oh you and I 
And Mingle in the stream 
Shall we liquefy 
Oh you and I 
And vanish into the sea ? 

Still sleeping you woke me up 
Muttering in your dream 
In darkness I could feel your 
Your little body breathing 
And I thought 
You feel just fine to me 
You feel just fine to me 
You feel just fine to me 
Shall we liquefy 
Oh you and I 
And mingle in the stream 
Shall we liquefy 
Oh you and I 
And vanish into the sea ? 

Will I always love you ? 
I just don't know 
I'll give it a go 
Will you always love me ? 
How could you know ? 
Just give it a go 

I was at a party 
That's when it came to me 
Oh what a moment 
I was reading a magazine in someone's bedroom 
And I thought 
You're just so fine to me 
You're just so fine to me 
You're just so fine to me

"event","so yeah....my mom walked in on me and jody today. we werent doing anything....but my shorts were off so accusations and assumptions were made. i cried a lot...talked to my momma and set some new ground rules for hanging out with him (when shes not home) then talked to his mom on the phone about it and she was oddly understanding..and now i believe its not that big of a deal because me and my momma talked about it and yeah but i was just...ashamed...and me and jody wont be getting close to doing anything for a WHILE but at least we can still kiss cuz for a while he couldnt even do that because he was so freaked

"event","i have the BEST boyfriend ever!



so heres the scoop on last night

after i got done with work i went and got ready (did i mention i got off early too :-D) anyways...around 3 i went to pick jody up from work and dropped him off so he could get ready. Then we decided to go to the Peoria heights tower first....because it was waaaaay to early to eat dinner...and on the way there i kept talking about how much i looooooove jet....

anyways we got there and the view was amazing....my skirt kept blowing up but no one else was there so yeah...and they had arrows on the railing pointing in the direction of really big cities like london and paris and stuff (but the didn't have one for new york...boo hoo) and jody put in a quarter so i could look out one of those telescope things and it was FREAKING AWESOME! the elevator ride was scary though...

then jody said he had to stop by target and i couldn't follow him wherever he went. when we got back out to the car he had a bag and i asked him what was in it....and he gave it to me...and guess what it was! he bought me the jet cd...how sweet is that!


then we went to olive garden i had the chicken parmesan and it was alright...but salad and everything was delicious and i had a lovely time there


then we went to barnes and nobles for coffee cuz the place we were going to go was closed...i got really good coffee there....


and finally we went to that place we found that overlooked the whole city and met a couple of college basketball players they were cool...all in all it was an awesome night



i love jody

so that's why i begin to wonder, is this really what the real world is going to be like? is this what my dad meant when he said stuff like ""get a job you like so you don't hate getting up everyday."" so now i'm really worried because i'm starting to trust my dad's advice...but i mean it is good advice. My dream to be a journalist (please dont judge my writing abilities on the way and stuff i'm writing now) but if i somehow don't make it will i resent the rest of my life? i mean, is doing what you love that important because there's also the theory that to be completely happy you need to be unhappy...but that's not true right?






Because I've grown accustomed to being happy...


and i really don't want to be stuck in pekin later in life waiting and hating my life ugggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh



but i guess coming a step closer to my dream of being what i want to be and being where i want to be means paying my dues...going to bed...and working my @$$ off in the morning



so regretfully i say goodnight :-(



until next time- rikki

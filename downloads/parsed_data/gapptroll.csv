"event","So I'm layin in bed... in pain, very very much pain.  I played rugby in frickin Memphis Saturday and we so lost.  Even tho we lost we actually played really really good.  We kept up the first half but I think the amount of time played and heat got to us.  They were a women's team who are older, more experienced, and very much in shape.  Let's just say that they warmed up by running around the field 3 times and we just ran around once and I was already breathing hard.  So let me list my injuries... my neck hurts when I look down, my scapula is sore, I got bruises on my leg, each step I take hurts, my ribs hurt, I have scrapes on my arms, oh yeah, and the inside of my mouth is busted.  I went to make a tackle and someone else had gotten the tackle so we kinda collided and their head hit my mouth and thats how that happened.  It looks kinda bad on the inside.  It bled on the inside and you can tell it's a little swollen on the outside.  I'm sure I'll find more pain somewhere else as the day goes on.  We have a game at Tulane next week and I dunno if my body is ready for it... ugh.
So school has been goin pretty good so far.  I need to do some studying today.  I'm trying to study more in general.  I have a Kinesiology exam this Thursday and I'm bound to do really well.  Especially if I plan on making this my 2nd major.  I'm glad I have athletic trainers as friends cuz they help me so much in my classes, like my taping class, they show me the proper way to do it and make me say why its done that way or whatever, and they've taken all the classes I've taken so they're a big help.
I got a raise at cici's and will probably be working more whenever I see that raise on my paycheck (the raise is a pretty good jump up).  I normally work saturday and sunday mornings except when I have rugby.  I don't work intramurals a whole lot, this month isn't too good for me anyways.  I've worked like once and I have one game today to work and then I play.  October will be much better.  My night class will be over cuz it's an 8 week class so I'll have an extra night to work, plus I get to work main so I can work and study at the same time.  Hopefully that'll all work out okay."

"event","So recently I've decided that I want to double major.  My first major is Coaching with an emphasis in Strength & Conditioning.  So its like I'm not really ""coaching"" a sport, I'm going for more of a ""strength coach"" if you get my drift.  But so I have like 4 or 5 more classes that I'd have to take and here I am with technically 2 more years left of college.  I've decided on Kinesiology since I've pretty much have taken more than half of the classes that are required.  Doing that will most likely keep me here another year though b/c I would have to actually work for 2 semesters at a clinical or something.  But I'm hoping that would put me in a job immediately after I graduate so I won't end up with a degree and not using it.
My sister is coming to USM either next semester or next school year.  She wants to get a masters in PR.  That should be interesting lets just say...  My dad wants us to live together, and I'm not trying to be mean, but I'm content and definitely don't want to move!"

"event","So first day of classes is today!  I went to my 1st class, which was alright.  I at least know 1 person so that's a relief for me... it was shannon.  But when class ended I walked out in front of HPR and I end up stepping on a nail.  It goes straight through my sandal and of course punctures my foot.  It wasn't stuck in my foot or anything cuz my immediate reaction was to pick up my foot.  It just poked me a little bit and my foot was bleeding.  It was cuz they were doing the damn construction on the roof and after that happened, I looked around and saw too many nails where students walk and where the cars park.  I could so sue USM couldn't I?!  They should pay for my tuition!  So yeah... and then I couldn't remember the last time I had a tetna/techna (I have no clue how to spell that) shot so I had to go to USM clinic and get one.  Now my arm is friggin sore from the shot and today was just a suck ass day for me.  :o(  Well hopefully tomorrow is much better.  I wanted back to back classes but I think it ended up better than I thought cuz my first class is in the Payne Center, and then I can go workout for an hour, and then I'll just walk to HPR for my last class of the day!"

OOoooh, I get paid tomorrow!  And I'm expecting a FAT check!  Its gonna be grrreaat!
My parents finally came back from Vietnam.  My mom bought me a lot of dangling earrings, they're cute and all real gold!  Better not lose them cuz that would suck.  I expected to find a very tan sister but I was much darker than she was!  She told me that in that country, people like being more ""white"" than ""tan"".  And you know how we have bronzers here, they have stuff to make them more white.  I have no idea why anyone would wanna have white skin tone, cuz tan just gives you more color!  They are planning to go in 2 years after I graduate so I'll be able to go too.
I don't want school to start.  I'm content as to how things are now.  I'm not as stressed, worried, thinking too much... I'm just content.  And I like it."

Even if it's something that I know still won't happen I still get this angry feeling in me and so I have to make myself stop thinking about it so I won't get mad mad.

I tried calling my parents the other day and talked to my cousin from my mom's side and my uncle from my dad's side.  It was weird cuz I couldn't understand half the things he was saying to me.  I just wanted to talk to my parents!  But I found out they were in Ho Chi Minh city to vacation there and I guess someone told them I called cuz my sister Facebook-ed me and said they got my message.  Weird, of all things, she FACEBOOK-ED me!

I got that song from the movie Rent stuck in my head.  I finally saw it and now I know what all the fuss is about and how great it is.  I really liked it, more than I thought I would.  I think its cuz the last musical I saw was Chicago and I didn't like it at all.

My dad showed me where the Will and life insurance paper was and to not talk to anyone and go straight to a lawyer in the event something happens (which I pray that nothing bad happens).  Gave me keys to the front door in case I go home.  Mom showed me where she hid some stuff.  They'll be gone for exactly 4 weeks.  They bought me 4 phone cards so I HAVE to call them every weekend.  I guess when I know they're all at home, I feel safe...  Knowing that they're not gonna be here, I kinda wanna be with them. For some reason I feel guilty for not going on the trip with them.  B/c I know they wanted me to.  My dad said tho that they'll go in 2 years after I graduate and would be able to stay longer if we wanted since I wouldn't have school to deal with anymore.  So I hope that'll work out.
My parents are allowing my sister to move to Nashville and find a job there.  I'm really surprised b/c I would not move anywhere knowing that I don't have a job to start out with.  That's bold of her, but then again, she can't stay at home anymore.  I wonder what she's gonna do and how it's gonna workout.  She'll be moving there in August and my parents are gonna help her move in and stay for a weekend so I think I'm gonna go do that with them just to spend some time with them."

I like making money but lately its just too damn hot to be sittin outside for about 8 or 9 hours.  I'm startin to really like my work though cuz I've just gotten to know everyone better and I'm havin fun.
I think those diet pills drain me more.  I've been feelin really tired and haven't been eatin a lot.  But I like not eatin a lot.  I haven't even had the energy to go workout, and I ALWAYS go at least once or twice a week.  I dunno.
Or maybe its all just in my head...
Ugh, its somewhat late and I can't go to sleep.  I wish I had someone to talk to.  I just wanna talk, randomly talk about anything and everything.  Whatever, guess I'll just keep it all in then as usual.
For someone who doesn't hang around much, I have my way of knowing things.
I hate hypocrites.  I hate people who think they're ""cooler"" than everyone else.  I hate it when people change, and its not for the better.  I hate unjust decisions.
I watched Oprah today and it made me cry.  It was about how these people help abused, neglected, and raped kids in Africa.  One girl saved her money and as her wish for Make-A-Wish, she wanted to donate it to them and give them a better place to live since the place they lived in was like a dump.  Kinda inspires you to do something good while you're still here living on Earth.
I don't know if I wanna go to Formal or not...
I really wanted to ask my best friend Landon, but I feel like it'd be a burden on him since he does live in Canada at the moment.  On my senior prom he had came down just to go with me since he promised the year before that we would go together.  I did ask him to go to Formal with me last year, and he almost did but work prevented him from coming.  Its just that I dunno if I wanna go and its a lot of money to fly down here and back.  Maybe I was just afraid he is gonna say no and me get disappointed.  He did say that he's coming in July for two weeks and promised that we were gonna hang out.  I'm excited about that, however...
I gave up on believing promises a while back."

Wasn't too happy about that... my car was at the stop light at the intersection of hwy 49 and hardy and the light just turned green and all the cars hadn't started to go yet so my car was still at a stop... a chi o from behind was goin about 30, wantin to get in the turning lane, thinking she was gonna make it but ended up not.  Luckily it was a small scratch I can just scrape away the white marks with my nails... so I opted not to do anything about it cuz it just wasn't worth it.

Apparently wherever the hell she was goin she was in a rush but shit like that happens when you drive too damn fast or don't know for sure if you're gonna make it or not.

I started takin hydroxycut again... at least until the summer.  I wanna lose a few more pounds cuz I hate how I am right now.

Last night wasn't a good night.  It was co-rec teams and 2 people protested cuz the first one they complained that when we blew the whistle for halftime, that we couldn't cuz they were in the middle of an attempt to score... HOWEVER, no rule was explained to the officials that we couldn't do that.  It's its halftime then it's frickin halftime.  And the 2nd protest was about bad officiating?!  I dunno, but this guy yelled out of bounds and no one saw it and so I wasn't gonna call something I didn't see and so he yells ""bullshit"" and gets a red card.  Maybe this whole self officiating thing isn't a good idea.  It seems to go well with the girls team but not so much with guys.  Last week sigma chi pissed me off cuz they kept making obnoxious and ignorant comments throughout the whole game.  If I had the power then I would've kicked them off the field.

"event","So I did my presentation today for my HPR 405 class.  I was pretty fine until it got like 30 minutes until class started and I started to get all jittery.  I hate it when that happens.  I've done stuff in front of people before all the time and already took my oral communications class yet I still can't stop getting so frickin nervous!  Ashlee was in the group too!  She seemed to do real good with her presentation.  I felt like mine was the longest though... but I guess it always feels like that when you're the one talkin.  Overall the teacher said we got a high B so that's good.  I'm just glad it's over with...

So there's a party this Friday and I don't think I'll be able to go.  First of all, I have no clue where I stand with my points, second of all, I have a 20 page portfolio that is due that night online and I have yet to start on it, and thirdly, there's this band playin at Nicks that night that I kinda wanna go see.  The bartender said that it's someone who is gonna be playin there one last time and will probably hit it big sometime soon in the music industry.  I forgot the name of the singer but it sounds pretty good.  I have a feeling I'm gonna hate these next 2 months... or well until Spring Break anyways..."

"event","So I had no intentions of going home this weekend... okay, so I NEVER have intentions of going home any weekend, but this was an exception since my sister actually called my cell phone and asked for me to go home and go shopping with her.  I went shopping last weekend but who can turn down another shopping opportunity?!  She had good reason though... she said her spring break starts next weekend I believe and she'll be off to New Hampshire and New York and then she probably won't come home again until summer or something like that.  So that will be 3 months of not seeing her and if I didn't go home then it'd probably be like 5 months.  Plus, I called my dad and asked if he could go get some live crawfish and broil some for me when I come home.  Mmmm MMMmmmmmm!!!!  So yea, I'm kinda excited."

"event","So I found out today that I made a 73 on my Human A&P test...  to me thats not good enough and it boggled my mind that the teacher even said ""good job.""  I was hoping to at least get in the 80's or something.  So far I've been doin pretty good on my tests in every class.  I was psyched when I made a 107.5 on my Governance & Agencies in Sports class.  Me and some other person were the only 2 who made that high of a grade so that made me happy for the day.  I really hope that I made an A in my Human A&P lab practical...  we had to study all of the frickin bones of the body and the integument system and I know for sure that I didn't know 3 of the answers out of 50 and got 2 of the bonus questions right.  I also made a B in my Strength & Conditioning class, which is very very hard cuz I can't ever understand a word that comes out of his mouth.  He assumes that everyone in that class has already had Exercise Physiology but there are plenty (like me) who soo hasn't.  At least I got Alison in there to amuse me every now and then.  :o)  So yeah, for those who think that I don't study, which I didn't as much last sememster... well I do!!

It would have at least been a tie if they didn't get the touch point.  Went to a keg party, it was alright... I don't even know half of the boys that play now!  None of them are that cute anyways...  It's kinda interesting tho... 3 guys are from all different countries!!  Came late to the keg party so within an hour all the beer was gone and everyone went to Elmos.  It was alright there... I'm addicted to those computer-touch games.  For some odd reason there were a lot of Mexicans there that night which I did not like it at all.  They stare at you and think they're gonna get some ass but really they just look ugly and stupid.  Then I stare them down too... more of a ""no way in hell you better fuck off"" look yet they still smile at you and think its all good.  Then I got pissed... someone just pissed me off, thats all you need to know and now I'm still wantin to kick some ass.  Grrrrrrrr...... I have to go workout and get some of this stress off...."

The first night I went out there, I haven't been doin anything physical to my body and now it just plain hurts all the time.  I did lunges and squats yesterday so add bruises and muscle pain... that's not a good mixture.
I ran into one of my friends, who went to the same high school with me, the other day at the Payne Center.  He used to be a big guy but I was like ""whoa, check out them muscles!""  He lost like 90 pounds... that's amazing.  He told me about how you can be a certified personal fitness trainer at this gym called the Fitness Plex, which is where I used to go when I was at home.  He just got this guy to go around and teach him a few things and had to take a few online classes and they helped paid for a 200 dollar test and you could be certified just like that.  I think that would be awesome...  I just don't ever go home so I guess that doesn't matter for me, but I still think it's cool.  It'd be awesome if I was like a celebrity's personal trainer!!

So I decided that this semester I'm gonna try to study every night for at least 30 minutes so when it comes to test time, I'm not cramming everything and studying will be easier.  I really like my schedule this semester...  I got 2 morning classes on MWF starting at 10 and 1 class on Tuesday morning and 2 on Thursday.  It shouldn't be too bad.  I also gotta watch out for my online class... that totally kicks my ass when I don't remember to go to it.  I'm soo not looking forward to having to take my other required classes later on in the next year...  I think 3 of them require labs...

I decided to go to the clinic today after my stomach hurting for about 4 hours this morning, but unfortunately they weren't open.  I really really hope it's nothing serious... people are scaring me because they tell me that they might probe through my ass which doesn't sound pleasant by all means!!

I said I had to work and she told me that I didn't have to work so much and that whatever I need that they will provide it for me.  It's not that I don't like being home... I just like to keep myself busy.  Why waste my time around my house doing absolutely nothing for 2 or 3 weeks when I can be out and about doing something useful.  Arguments are minimum around the house now so going home isn't too bad... maybe next time a holiday comes around and I know my sister is there then I'll make more of an attempt to actually stay there.  She wanted me to come back for New Years... which I didn't cuz I didn't find a point cuz we never do anything but eat some black eyed peas and then they're back to work again.  Then again, maybe there isn't supposed to be a real point and its just the matter of the fact that I'm there spending time with them at home...
So yay, the Payne Center opens back up tomorrow and I'm excited about that.  I hadn't worked out in god forever and I feel as if my muscles are shrinking and like I've gained a few pounds.  So after I work tomorrow I'll probably take like a 2 hour break and then go workout.  Hmmm... so what's my new year's resolution for this year?  I never really have one so maybe I'll have a few this year.  My resolution is to lose a few more pounds and maintain my weight... I won't revolve my life around working out... I'll eat healthier and make healthier decisions... I wanna get back into rugby and love it again... be around my sorority sisters more is a definite plus... focus on my grades...

I have my weird ways of showing that I care in the most suttle ways.  I bought her one of those TV plug-n-play games of Ms. Pacman.  She talks about how she used to play that all the time and loves the original game so I got it for her.  She was really surprised to even get anything, especially from me... the less disciplined daughter of the family.  For the first time since I've been back, I actually enjoyed being at home with the fam tonight.  I heard everyone in the living room and went to see what all the commotion was about and they were having a good time playing the game.  I sat back and watched everyone and remembered how it use to be like that.  So why can't I let go of the bad things from the past, put down my pride, and enjoy the fun with them?!  It's just not the same.  I've been here for a good 4 days, but I plan on goin back to Hattiesburg tomorrow cuz I still plan on working at Cici's.

I wish I could go back in time and experience a Christmas like that again.  Now I just hate coming home to a house where I feel trapped, not bein able to do anything without someone criticizing me when I'm fucking 20 years old.  I come home to a sister that I don't really know anymore; and the more and more I'm around her, the more I don't like it.  ""Buy this for me Tina, daddy gave you cash.""  ""Why don't you drive me around since you like to drive.""  Whatever...  So my mom never really cooked Christmas dinner, but it was always nice when we put up the tree.  Me, sister, and my mother would be putting it up while my dad was just around.  I miss that.  Now all we do is go over to one of their friend's house all the way in Madison and have Christmas there.  It's not all that bad or anything... I'm just not used to it.  I guess I'm not too fond of change.  I wanna know what it's like to have a REAL christmas.  Being around people I love, going to a house I don't dread...  Maybe one day...
It's weird, when I come home I can't seem to have an appetite or to eat.  I had a gingerbread blast from sonic for lunch (which btw is very good!) and I had a cup of rice for dinner.  Hey, maybe my stomach will shrink some more, that'd be good.  In a way I don't mind not having an appetite, it's not like I'm very active to be burning any energy off.
Hope everyone has a very merry x-mas, later!"

I just think it's best for me to see things on the other side at the moment.  However one of my rugby friends did threaten to cut me off if I didn't go.  But she really wouldn't do that.  We had Big Sis/Lil Sis last night... it made me realize that I need to be on the floor more, or at least be more active in the events we do cuz I missed out on gettin a little cuz I really don't know anyone and no one really knows me.

I like my new job so far.  I finally get to work with Rec Sports... even though its just checkin people in and takin score, can't get any easier than that.  Plus, I get to work with my friend Ashlee sometimes!!  I plan on pickin up my 2nd job (Cici's) later on after my stress level goes down a bit.  I figured that since I only have an 8 o'clock class on MWF, I can work the morning shifts on those days.  People ask me why the hell am I even working one job and then I'll be workin 2 jobs...  Well to answer that question:  I don't want to always depend on my parents for money.  It's about that time where I wanna be able to know that I can make money on my own means without the help from them.  They give me too much money already... Plus, I have a sister who likes to spend money like it's nothing so a little extra money for myself won't hurt.  I feel as if as long as my parents provide me financially, they have complete control over my life.  I like to know that I can be dependent and do things on my own and not be restricted because I can't provide for myself.  And if I don't start doin' this then I'm gonna be at a lost once I graduate.

We had the kickball tournament on Friday, it turned out pretty good and was quite alright.  I worked the concession and got to play with the walkie talkies!!  Now that was FUN!!!  But it got old after a while...

I'm beginning to hate FaceBook... why do people become so nosey and so concerned about things that are said on there.  If only society wasn't already fucked up or cared so much about what others think then everything would be so much better..."

"event","Today has been awfully stressful.  I had an emotional breakdown this morning which I've never ever had before.  One bad bit of news lead to another bad thought and everything just kept flowing into my head and I just about blew it.  I must admit that I become very unrational with my thoughts when I get emotional and just wanna say ""FUCK IT!""  But I'm still confused about alot of things.  All I wanted to do today was sleep... sleep everything away and hope that it will go away... but nooo, Monday's are my busy days and I just kept going and couldn't even go to rugby practice.  Not that I had any desire to go to practice today.  Cramps kicked in bad and I still have a headache.
I hate it when my parents call me just to criticize me or tell me what to do.  Sometimes I wonder why I bother picking up the phone when I know it's gonna be something negative.  I hate that they still try to tell me what to do.  They know that I won't listen.  They can hit me but they know that that won't work anymore.  Emotional pain is harder to deal with than physical pain.  They want me to change my major to something that will get me a job and make a crapload of money once I graduate from college, but I'm not really worried about making a shit load of money... what's the point if I'm not gonna be happy?  Ugh, they don't understand nor will they ever understand.  I feel bad last time I quickly stopped by my house... I know my mom loves me and would probably have liked a hug.  But I just can't bring myself to do it.  Nothing to explain, just can't, and now I feel guilty and I know that I will regret all of this later on.
My roommate just asked me if I lost weight... I gave her this dumbfounded look cuz if anything, I've gained weight.  I've slacked off working out everyday.  I don't know why but I've just been so tired lately.  Tired from what though?!  I don't have class Tuesdays and Thursdays and all I have is like 2 classes on MWF.
So we had ""dance tryouts"" tonight...  Ugh... I'll just keep my comments to myself just to be on the safe side.  We looked at Chi O's dance from Derby Days last year and used a segment from it to teach the girls who wanted to tryout.  It was, well... quite interesting.  
So the rugby tournament that's in Georgia is the same weekend of initiation.. what to do, what to do.  I wanna be there for both but I can't... writing about this reminds me of a certain part in a Kelly Clarkson song... ""I'm torn into pieces!  Can't deny it, Can't pretend... Broken up, deep inside, but you won't get to see the tears I cryyyy..."""

"event","Ever had something in the back of your mind and always wanted to ask but was too afraid to?  Well I'm in the predicament at the moment.  This will probably make no sense at all but I've been wanting to ask a friend of mine this question because it has been bothering me for a while, but in a way it's a touchy subject and also I'm scared of what the answer will be.  Ugh.... this sucks.  And normally I can tell this person almost EVERYTHING!!!  Except this one little question that just won't come out of my mouth yet will stay in the back of my mind.  Whatever...

Rugby hasn't been going very well this semester.  I'm quite very disappointed.  We barely have enough players to have a team, nobody ever goes to practice anymore cuz they are injured or what not.  I don't even know the new girls yet and not to prejudge anyone or anything, but I'm not ""feeling"" them at all whatsoever.  Some of the girls are okay but the others are iffy to me.  I sooo miss how it was last year.  Everyone got along, I loved going to practice, nights at Nicks were totally fun, and the parties were frickin awesome.  And it's soo the opposite as of now.  I wish I could rewind time to change things in order to make things better.  But that'll never happen!

So this morning I look at the point system we have for theta and I am back down to 70 points!  Fifteen taken off just cuz I couldn't find a friend to come to COB with me... that's crappy but whatever...  I'm startin not to give a shit about the point system, YES you heard right, I don't care anymore!  It's already half of the sememster and do I really care or have the time as of now to worry about going to parties?!?!  Not so much!  So I think my goal now is to see if I can get negative points.  Let's see how low I can go...  WORRYING ABOUT POINTS = STRESS.  I am however, am oober excited about dancing in Margaritaville.  I LOVE the style of dance for this philanthropy and can't wait!  Allison's friend O'Brian is gonna choreograph it I think and hope.  He's an awesome dancer and it's gonna be HOTT!!!!!!"

"event","I always keep saying that I'm gonna quit my job but I've yet to do so.  The only time I wanna quit is when I get stressed out from there, which recently it has been quite often.  My original plan was to only keep it during the summer... but I get paid pretty well to do some easy shit and workin with some of the people there isn't bad at all, I actually like a good bit of the people there... which is why I've kept my job so far.  I really need more study hours during the weekend.  I asked one of the managers to not schedule me unless they really absolutely need me, but he gave me a butt load of hours this week!  27 frickin hours!  Plus theta, plus rugby, plus, plus school... damn!  That's all I gotta say about that.  Ever feel torn between two things you love and you just can't choose but you have to at times?!  That's how I've been feeling recently.  What is it do you ask?  Well it's rugby and theta...  I love both, and we have a football game this weekend and if I can get someone to take my shift at work then who do I go to the game with?!  I really really wanna hang out with my team yet I really really wanna hang out with theta...  it's like a game of tug-of-war and the only way I would be able to choose is to do ini-mini-mine-e-o... ugh, I hate this...."

Classes are finally over so woohoo!  This is my last week of work until after a while and I totally racked up a lot of hours so I'm stoked about that.  I went to a rugby tourney last weekend in Georgia and it was alright.  We camped out and I'm not that big on camping just cuz I like my bathroom/shower/electricity.  :o)  Other then that, it was okay but I wish the whole team was there, that would have been fun.  So I got a phone call from my sister on Monday... totally unexpected and she was like ""come home so we can hang out and go to the mall.""  And I was like, ""I can't cuz I have to work all freakin' day.""  So I decided to go home Thursday so we can chill for a bit and I may come back to ""da burg"" Friday afternoon or ride back up Saturday morning and head straight to work.  I do gotta buy some recruitment clothes for Theta anyways so I'll accomplish something when I go home.  :o)"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>tuesday: i cleaned my room for most of the day. i took jacob to the movies at 5 and on the way, picked sarah up. sarah and i went into the mall to pick up the applications she needed that had blown out her window earlier and then left. we drove to hobby lobby to pick up pages for my scrapbook and stuff to make our basketball t-shirts. then we went back to her house to make them. on the way home, she called keith and he came over to hang out. then we went to blockbuster to rent a movie or two. on the way back to sarah's house, jacob called for me to come pick him up so we just went in keith's car. then keith drove jacob and i back to sarah's house and then i took him home. i returned to sarah's house for dinner (we had nachos) and the movie (dirty dancing havana nights). i watched a little more than half before going home when it started to rain. i kinda felt like a third wheel anyway so its all good.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>wednesday: sarah picked me up at 11 and we went to starbux for some apple cider before driving to keith's house. his mother drove us to the game in willow ridge. the guys lost by 4 points and keith didnt even play. oh well. sarah and i went out afterwards to sonic for lunch and then the pizza place to say hi to ian. we also went back to the pizza place that night to hang out for a while.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>thursday: THANKSGIVING!!!! i went to my grandmas house to help cook the side dishes cuz the turkey was in my oven. then i came back at like 2 to make the mashed potatoes and my stuffed mushrooms. mom and grandma came a little later when all of the sidedishes were done. and we ate at like 4:30 or 5. after dinner, we all took a walk around the lake and then went homa and watched the harry potter movie. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>friday: i woke up and went to work at 10 and i was there til 3:30. then i went to cash my check. i went to the mall cuz i needed to go to old navy to pick something up and then stopped by claires. when i left the mall, i went to kohls cuz i needed a new belt but i ended up getting a few other things. i spent most of my paycheck with in 2 hours. i came home to read for a little while. stark called and invited me to come to starbux with him so i did. we eventually went over to the pizza place after sarah called. i had to be home at 10 tho which sucked. mark was there with some other people. this guy kevin was there and at like 9 or so, these guys came and like yelled at him for supposedly pulling a gun on some guy. it was fraking scary so after they left, we told kevin he should prolly get out of there before and if they came back. they didnt&nbsp;but it was still scary. the guys were talking about going to an intersection and having someone who has been ducktaped&nbsp;jump out of a trunk and run while two others run after him in their boxors. they actually did after i left and they got it on tape. oh well.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>saturday: i didnt wake up til noon and then had to work at 3 until 10 so i didnt really do much. i did&nbsp; try to check if all my stuff was at A&amp;M yet but it didnt work cuz of the holiday so i have to wait til later this week. i also got out&nbsp;of work late and scared my mom cuz i wasnt home at my usual time but its all good.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>sunday: im working at 3 and i went to church this morning. we ate lunch at the empanada house and it was really good. i finished rosencranz and gildenstern are dead just now but thats about it.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>friday: i found out my SAT score(its pretty good so im happy) and cashed my check. then i went home. sarah picked me up and we went to starbucks to meet brenden after realizing that no one was at the pizza place yet. then we went back to the pizza place after hanging out for a bit. jared called and we told him where we were gonna be so he came to hang out.&nbsp;basically, it sucked once we got there. mark showed up at like 8 with his bro and friends so i gave him his homecoming pictures. then sarah kinda went into a sucky mood and wouldnt say why. it finally just pissed me off so i went and sat by myself. amy finally realized i was upset so she came over to say hi. then she invited me to go to sonic with her and a few other people. i said yes and then went to call sarah and get my stuff. sarah was my ride so i called her but she said she might leave so i should get my stuff out of her car. while i was doing that, everyone who was going to sonic left. that really pissed me off. i feel bad cuz i kinda snapped at reed at some point and i didnt mean to. eventually, it got so bad with sarah that i just called my mom and had her come pick me up. the night sucked in general.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>saturday: my parents let me sleep til noon and then i got up, made my bed and went to hang out at my grandma's house. we were there til about 3:30 and i had to be at work at 4. i was in a major rush to get to work but i made it. sarah, keith, and isabell came while i was at work and sarah handed me a card and a box of mike and ikes. the card was so funny. we made up and its all good now. sarah called me after work and invited me to come hang out at starbucks with her an keith. i said hey why not and went home to change. then i left again. i was there til about 11 and then came home. i kinda felt like a third wheel but i didnt really wanna say anything. oh well.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>sunday: we went to church and then came home. i worked on my scrapbook and stuff before leaving for work. i had to be there at 3. thats about all that happened on sunday. it was kinda a boring day.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>monday: today...my mom woke me up at 9:20 so that i could get up and clean my room. then i went to that secret santa thing at taylors house from 12 til 2. that was fun. we ate and watched will and grace episodes and played spoons. i drove mandy home and on the way i told her about my SAT score and A&amp;M. she made some kinda mean comments about it and it kinda upset me. then i came home and worked on college stuff...im almost done except for the essay part...grrrr. mandy called and was kinda weird on the phone but i didnt really think anything of it. she showed up about an hour later with a thing of brownies that had ""gig'em aggies"" and stuff on them. it was really sweet and kinda funny. i dont think im gonna be able to go out tonight cuz it has been raining all day&nbsp;but jared called and he offered to keep me company. oh well, maybe sarah and a few people can come over if i cant go out. </FONT></STRONG></P>

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>hey. this weekend was extremely cool/crappy but i will start from the beginning.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>FRIDAY: we got to wear our mums to school and that was pretty kewl cuz the entire school jingled. then we had a pep rally during 7th period in the stadium behind the school. the football game was pretty fun but i was having a pretty bad day because mandy and sarah were mad at each other, pms, and a few other things so i was in an uber bad mood. we won the game against alief taylor making us 8-0 so we get to go to playoffs. sarah and jacob and i stopped at the pizza place on the way home so i got a big hug from mark and one from dennis. that was fun. mark played redneck woman really load and&nbsp; everyone was upset. oh well they can get over it. then i went home to sleep.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>SATURDAY: homecoming!!!!! i woke up at about 10 or so and got dressed and went to go cash my check. while i was out, i got my eyebrows done and then came home to do my nails and shave before i had to get my hair done at 2. my nails truned out pretty good considering i did them myself. mark came to pick me up at 4 and my dad took a few pictures before we left. we drove to sarah's and picked her up. her and her sister looked so awesome!!! then, since ian was actually at the pizza place, we decided to meet dennis there. marks mom came to bring my corsage because mark had left it in the refrigerator. while we were waiting for&nbsp;dennis to arrive, sarah and i walked over to eckerds to buy sarah a camera. dennis showed up and we left to go to ashley's house but we were late. we took group pictures before heading to dinner. dinner was so awesome. it took about 20 or 25 minutes to get to the melting pot and like 3 and a half hours to eat but it was so good. i realized while we were there that i had not eaten anything at all that day. however, it only took the boys about 6 minutes to get back to the school. mandy said jason hit about 115 at one point. we got the the dance but i had spilled some white chocolate on my dress so after we checked out stuff, we danced for a little while before taking pictures so my dress could dry. the dance was fun but the dj kinda sucked and he only played like 2 and 1/2 slow songs in like 2 hours. then, when the dance ended, sarah, dennis, mark, and i stopped by pat's house to say hi. then we went to megans house and watched Bringin' Down the House until like 1:30 am.&nbsp; then mark took me home and i took my hair down, took&nbsp;a shower, and went to bed. it was a lot of fun!!!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>SUNDAY: i slept until about 1 pm and then had band practice at 2:30 until 3 pm. it rained on us for about 15 minutes but we got a lot of work done. then i went home, did some homework and went to sleep.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>MONDAY: monday was sooooo long. we had to be at school in warmup block at 5 am. then we had runthru and inspections before loading the buses for the trip to san antonio. it took us about 4 hours to get there and i slept most of the way. we got there later then we were supposed to so we had a hurried warmup and got set in our contest block except it was backwards. then we had to flip it and stuff. we were not even up to the gate when they started our time so half of us ran to the gate. we marched pretty wel but we only had 44 seconds left. sam was crying on the podium during the show because she was scared that we would run over time like we did 2 years ago. when we got off the field, we went to the busses to change and then headed to hard rock for lunck. that was fun. after lunch, we went back to the stadium to watch the other bands. nick said hi to the drummajor from taft high school so sarah asked about their cymbal line. we started talking to these pretty cute guys named barry and michael. barry was the drumline captain and michael plays the saxophone. sarah and i ended up hanging out with them until the end of prelims. michelle came up to me during prelims with emmalee(ed) and told me that matt had been in a car accident and died over the weekend(this was the crappy part) and that they were having a thing on wednesday night in his memory. i cant believe this is hapening again!! its not fair. when they annouced who was going to finals, we were smack dab in the middle of the taft and warren bands, both of which had black shirts on. WE MADE FINALS!!!!!!!!! so did the taft band which was kewl. we went back to the buses for dinner but after dinner and a pep talk from vanna, when we actually boarded the buses, i burst into tears cuz steph had just called to tell me about matt and hinted that it might have been a drunk driver that hit matts car but no one knows for sure. then we got ready for finals. warmup was pretty good and we made it to the field on time. the show was freaking awesome!! we went back up into the stands to wait for the finals results and we saw barry again on the way in. he said they had marched a pretty good show too. sarah and i were hoping that taft would got the state with us(even tho we didnt kno for sure if we were even going) cuz then we would get to see barry and michael again. it took forever for them to annouce the results but when they di, they said that the following schools would be going to compete at state next tuesday in the alamodome: churchill, cinco ranch, cy fair, cyfalls, reagan, and langham creek...notince that cinco ranch is in that list. we made 5th place during finals so WE ARE GOING TO STATE!!!!!!! how awesome is that? we celebrated in the stands and then loaded the buses to come home. we didnt get home until 2:30 am so our principal said we didnt have to come to school til 3rd period. i went straight to sleep when i got home as soon as i took my shower.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>TUESDAY: today was long to. i slept til 8 and then picked mandy, tat, and sarah up and went to school. i made it through the day but i supposed to have read Catch-22 read by tomorrow and im on page 107. i fell asleep by accident during fourth period. i did my tutoring thing after school and went to pick jacob up from school cuz we didnt have pracitce. the we dropped averyone off and jacob and i stopped by the pizza place for some bawls and i needed to talk to sarah. before i left to go to tutoring, cassie saw me and told me that matt had been coming home from austin at like 4 in the morning and that he and 3 of his frat brothers were hit by a car that came the wrong way on the ramp. matt and two of his frat brothers died and i think the other is in the hospital. the funeral is on thursday. it sounds way to much like what happened to greg. we do not kno if the other driver was drunk or not. i am still in complete shock that this is happening. he was only 18!! i took my brother to his tuba lesson and bought the cliffnotes for Catch-22. now im at home doing homework. my dad made another comment about my weight at dinner tonight so i sont hink im gonna eat much in the next few days. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>i should prolly go finish my homework so i can go to bed. ill update more later &lt;3</FONT></STRONG></P>"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>friday: school was alright but i had two spanish quizzes (one was supposed to be that day and the other was one that i missed when i wasnt in school wednesday). we also had a peprally because we played taylor. then we had the game and that was pretty kewl. we thought we might lose cuz we got behind in the first quarter but we ended up winning the game 30-10. that makes us <EM><U>6-0</U></EM> with <EM><U>3-0</U></EM> in district and that is effin awesome!!!&nbsp;we have bragging rights again for the forth year running. then sarah and i went to the pizza place before going home. her parents are so kewl cuz they let her stay out til 12:30 and mine wouldnt even let me go out(they dont kno that i stopped at the pizza place but it is on my way home so...) mark was there when we got there but he left like 15 minutes later. mandy was late cuz she was hanging out with Jason. then i had to take mandy home and i was gonna go back but i decided to just go home. then i went to sleep cuz we had to be at school at 9:30 am on saturday.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>saturday: i got up at like 8:30 or something to get ready for the contest. then i took my brother to pick up mandy but we stopped at eckerds/cvs to get food first. then we picked her up and went to school. runthru was uber long and boring. everyone got their food and we ate lunch in the school and had inspections. the bus ride was relatively uneventful. then we warmed up in the parking lot of the stadiumfor about 30 minutes or something. then we marched our show and we did pretty good considering. since it is our contest, we cant technically win but we will find out later how we did in comparison to the other bands. we had to take a band picture and it was really hot because of our uniforms and then we went back to the bus. i finally found sarah and we went into the stands. my mom gave me money for me and my brother while sarah talked to her mom and dad. then we got food, bought sarah a t-shirt, and watched the other bands til it was time for the awards ceremony. then we rode the buses back to school. when we got back i stopped to say hi to jared stark and he mentioned that i should go with him to the katy vs. mayde creek football game that night. i told him i would ask my parents. we went to mandy's house to get her clothes and then she showered at my house before going to the muellers to ""babysit"" and while she showered i asked if i could go&nbsp;to the game. first, they both said no, then when i asked my mom why she said cuz she didnt want me driving. but jared said that he could drive me but then my dad said no and my mom talked to him and she said no because she found out that i have to work tomorrow at 8:00am even though we dont have school on monday. she doesnt want me to get too tired. so basically im stuck at home on a saturday night with my dad and my brother because i cant get out of my house. i hate sitting at home cuz i always get yelled at for something or another but i cant very well tell my parents that. i hate this so much. this pretty much ruined my weekend up to this point. plus im not really allowed on aim cuz i was asking a question about homework on thursday night(i was asking over aim cuz my mom was using my phone) and he walked in and screamed at me. (see why i dont like being at home???) but because i cant go out tonight im not gonna do anything that they want me to get done (aka clean my room, look up colleges, go to bed early, etc.) because im mad at them. well thats aboput it so far. ill update more later.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>hey. friday night was pretty kewl. i picked sarah up from the drumline party and we met dennis, pat and brenden at i*cafe. brenden had just gotten his new STI and so we took a little ride in it. then we all went to the pizza place to hang out. dennis and pat installed something in pats car and then jaclyn and steph showed up. jaclyn told everyone that she had bought her top for $3 at the limited too and ian made a comment about how small her shirt was. she told him that she didnt think she liked him but when she walked away, he called her a b****. it was really funny. she came back a few minutes later and made a comment about my chest (it was really weird hearing that from another girl). but oh well. we basically hung out for a while and then mark and some of his friends showed up so that was kewl. sarah, dennis, and brenden left to go to sonic. sarah called me a few minutes later that brenden had been pulled over and that she would call me back when she got home. turns out that brenden had been pulled over, ticketed and almost arrested. she also said that dennis had gotten a ticket too. she was like freaking out the entire time. im really glad i decided not to go with them. oh well. i found out this morning that dennis lost his job and that really sucks. but it means that he is prolly gonna go see sarah perform at the drumline contest and then go to our game tonight against hastings. that part is really kewl. well thats about it so far. ill try to update again after the game to tell everyone how that goes. &lt;3 ya'll. cat</FONT></STRONG>"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>then today, my parents said i couldnt go which caused another big fight. i got so upset that my dad drove me to school because i was not ok to drive. we were late leaving but i got to class on time. the entire day just sucked. we had band practice from 3:15 until 5:30 and then my mom was late picking me up. then i got ready for church and while my brother got us dinner at mcdonalds, i went to i-cafe to say hi to dennis and pat was there too. then after church i went to grandma's hoiuse to pick up a snack she made us for the game on friday. now im supposed to be doing hw but obviosly im not. guess thats it.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>friday: we had a football game and it went by really fast. mandy and sarah and i walked for GSL and halftime was allright but not fantastic. when we got back from halftime i saw josh. he was going to move to tennessee but now hes not and is going to katy hs instead. how cool is that? he sat with me and mandy during the third quarter and then went to say hi to other people. we won the game 14-7 vs. Stratford. we got back at like 11:30 or so. then i went home to sleep.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>saturday: i got up at like 11:30 and started to clean my room and stuff like that so that i could go out with sarah. i left my house at like 2:30 to get my check from work and then came home and did a little yardwork. i went to pick up sarah at 5:10 and we were supposed to meet blake at i-cafe at 5:30. he was already there when we pulled up so we went in to talk to him and dennis. then blake drove us to sams where we waited for everyone in HTC to meet us so we could ""roll out together."" we then drove to the marquee center and the 4th floor of the parking garage where we hung around until we were sure everyoine was there. blake realized that some potholes&nbsp;we hit had damaged his car so he was not&nbsp;in a very good mood.&nbsp;then we ate dinner at redrobin and talked for a long time. sarah and i were supposed to ride with blake from the HTC meet to the OC meet but he didnt want to go cuz he was worried bout his car. so mark, this 20 yr old hottie that was there, offered to take us cuz he was going anyway. we rode for about 45 minutes in his taurus and listened to country music (how awesome is it that he doesnt mind country). we got to the OC meet at like 10:30 or so and both sarah and i had to be home at 11:30. we didn't leave the OC meet until 10:50 and i didnt get home until like 11:35 or 40. i rode with pat on the way home and he has a sweet car.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>sunday: i woke up at like 10 to get ready for church but when i turned my phone on at 10:30 i had a message from sarah and she was crying so hard that i couldnt understand her. i called her back and when she told me what had happened, i told her that i would be right there. i went downstairs to tell my mom that i wasnt going to church cuz sarah needed me. then i rushed to her house. here's what happened----Greg Jackson had been in austin texas for a yellowcard concert because he knows a guy in yellowcard. on his way back from the concert, a drunk driver swerved into his lane and hit his car head on. Greg died instantly and his friend david is in the hospital. the drunk driver is also in the hospital.&nbsp; Greg was sarah's ex boyfriend and she still loved him. they broke up about a month ago because sarah couldnt take the stress that came with the age gap. i had met greg multople times and i was usually the accomplice when they wanted to see each other. ----i spent from 11am to 4pm at sarah's house and only left because i had to be at work at 5 until 10. i didnt start crying really bad until after i left sarahs house. sarah was at her house by herself until brenden asked to hang out with him and a few other friends. i jouned them at the pizza place after i got off of work. i was there until almost 11:30. i hoped that outing helped her get her mind off of what happened.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3366ff>monday: today is monday so yeah. i woke up and started my homework but then mom wanted me to go to the fabric store with her and my grandma.we also went to lunch and i got my fabric for my homecoming dress and i got my hair cut. now im trying to write a paper and talk to people online. thats about it i guess for today.</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on monday i went to sarah's sister's swim meet. keith was there so that was interesting. keith and i don't particularly get along at the moment. i also got the meet greg and actually talk to him. ive met him before for only like5 minutes. he seems like a pretty nice guy. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on tuesday i didnt really do very much at all. it was kinda a grundge day and iu just sat around the house. i did go out with sarah cuz my dad didnt want me sitting around the house all day. we went to the pizza place and then just drove around.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on wednesday it rained for a lot of the day. i hung out with my grandma and little brother&nbsp;for most of it. we went to the post office (my grandma wanted to get her passport but it was to busy so we just sent a package of cookes to ima jean), target (cuz grandma needed water shoes before we leave on saturday), to lunch with my mom (at the pie shoppe), to ace hardware (grandma needed something for her sewing machine), the library (i got a new card and checked out 5 books), home (to drop Jacob off), hancock fabrics (i got a pattern for pants and a formal dress pattern that might be my prom dress), and eckerds (to get grandma's picture taken for her passport). after that i went home&nbsp;and then went to the gym for about 45 minutes or so. sarah had called earlier and wanted to go to the mall so jacob and i hurried home. i took a shower really fast and then went to pick them (sarah, izzy, and anna)&nbsp;up from the walgreens parking lot (don't ask). then we went to the mall where anna bought an entire out fit (including shoes and a hat). we went back to sarah's house and her mother took us out for mexican food at el jaritos. it was really good.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on thursday it was raining even more than on wednesday. my dad had made appointments at the dentist for me and jacob that started at 8 30 am but we didnt get there on time because of the rain but we did get there. afterwards i went home and read for a while. then sarah called and asked me to go see white chicks with her, anna, and greg. it started at 4 35 pm so i went and then came home. this was my 2 month with ryan too but we didnt get to do anything together.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today (friday) has been pretty uneventful. but my aunt, uncle, and cousin are coming in today. thats cool. i did just watch EVER AFTER the movie and i love that movie. well i guess that is it for now. i might be going to ryan's house tonight so that would be neat.</FONT></STRONG></P>

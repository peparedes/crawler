"event","So, I guess it's time for good old 2004 to come to an end. It's definitely been a long year. In January, I dealt with 1st semester finals in high school. From February - May, I was in Germany having the time of my life. After I got back, I had the hardest two weeks of my life, having to finish up classwork, take AP exams on the alternate testing dates (meaning that other stuff was being done in class), and graduate from high school essentially all at once. After graduation, I worked all summer in a grocery store (not the funnest of times). Then, at the end of August, I finally made the trek off to college, away from my old self, away from my past, away from the things around me that I loved to hate so much. In my first semester of college, I feel that I really developed as a person. I learned how to balance the responsibilities of school and the demands of working on a Presidential campaign with the necessity of some kick-ass partying. It was an awesome experience. Now, at the end of it and at the beginning of a new year, I can look back and say that it's definitely been a good year and that I'm greatly looking forward to the next.

"event","ARGH. Today did not start well. I woke up to the sound of the bird squawking and my brothers being loud assholes; I started the day pissed off. Then, I proceeded to get into a fight with the motherfucker formally known as ""fucker the older brother"" because he didn't want me to spray the bird with the water bottle (its only practicable form of punishment). He knows zero about behaviorism and animal psychology, or any psychology for that matter. He thinks that the bird should be treated like a human being. Hahaha. No. The only way to modify its behavior is to use rewards/punishments as incentives. There's no talking to the thing. Does Dale get that? No. Why? BECAUSE HE'S A MORON!!! Then, like half an hour after that, there was a Cub Scout meeting at my house. So, we've gone from squawking bird and asshole brothers to a dozen screaming 2nd-graders. <i>Perfect.</i> At that point, I went upstairs and had some ""me time"" and quietly reflected upon how much life in this house sucks, and why it is that I went to school in Madison in the first place (to get away). Usually it's my dad who drives me to insanity, but my brothers succeeded in taking me there this morning (and dad's not even here today). I then spent the rest of the morning imagining the most beautifully horrifying methods of fratricide. 

Since the whole morning of bullshit, I've been lurking in my room all day (as usual) and sitting on the computer in a combination of mindlessly looking at facebook, watching The Day After Tomorrow, feeling sorry for myself, jabbering on IM, and melting my brain trying to relearn calculus for next semester. Oh yeah...I never wrote about the whole schedule thing!

<b>**TANGENT**

On Sunday, December 26th, I made a big decision! That's right, <b><u>I</b></u> made a decision. I decided that I'm not going to major in political science or international studies. I'm going to go the math/science direction instead. Am I crazy? Probably. The reason though is that I've realized that I would be bored beyond all comprehension if I had a desk job for the rest of my life. I can't stand the idea of being someone's perpetual paper-bitch. During the semester, I complained about chem constantly, mostly because I didn't really know what I was doing or how to study effectively for the class. I enjoyed the content of the class, but the whole exam-thing kept getting me down throughout the semester. Yet, because of my outstanding performance on the final exam, my semester grade and I ended up coming out on top. In retrospect, I really liked the class because it was the only class that I was forced to invest a lot into in order to do well. It was the most rewarding because it wasn't just spouting back bullshit for 15 weeks (ILS 209 anyone?). So now instead of taking polisci, econ, linguistics, and german next semester, I'm taking Math 222 - Calc II, Physics 207 - Sem 1 Calculus-based, and Chem 104 - Sem II. What am I going to do with it? The majors that are on the table right now are Biochemistry (Premed Curriculum), Physics, and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. We'll see how that one goes around the end of next semester. 

**END TANGENT**</b>

So back to the calculus. It's actually going really well so far. I've found that I can actually do the math better now than I could a year ago. No, it doesn't make sense. I agree. 

Days until Madison: about 16"

So here I am at home, plopped on my butt in front of the computer, mindlessly typing away to my miniscule internet audience. I'm bored, you see, so this is going to become a very common thing until I get back to Madison and get back to work. 

Today hasn't been too exciting. Mom's been baking all day and my brothers have been pissing me off on an unfortunately regular schedule. As always, my little brother Josh is the cool one. I woke up at like 11 or something like that after having a series of dreams so twisted that I wondered if I had taken drugs and forgotten about it. I watched TV for a little while, then cleaned my room some, and watched some more TV. Let's not forget that I've been checking my grades compulsively every 10 minutes (or less) since tuesday, and that wasn't at all different today. I want to find out if I got an A in chem or not!! Around 4 or so I gave out my presents for my family. Josh's present was without a doubt the most fun. I bought him Super Mario Brothers for Game Boy Advance which has the original old-school Mario, and then the Super Nintendo one (clearly the best Mario game ever). So that he would have no clue what it was, I put it in a box with a frozen spaghetti squash in a plastic bag for dead weight. He was surprised and happy, not to mention the fact that it's my favorite game ever, so I can play it too while I'm sitting at home on break. Dale and Patrick (older and younger brothers, respectively) got Nalgene bottles from me out of an effort to get them to down more H20 as opposed to obscene amounts of soda. I gave my parents a new teakettle for the stove because our old one was decrepit. Later, we had food. Then we opened the rest of the presents, and I got the digital camera that I'd been beckoning after for months. I took a few kick-ass pictures to put on facebook and was very pleased with how they turned out. Because my brothers were pissing me off still, I did my laundry and retreated to my room afterward and proceeded to clean up and do stuff on the computer. Exciting day? Not so much. At least it's Christmas and presents were involved in the equation of the day's drudgery. 

Tomorrow the extended family is coming over for more food and presents. Woohoo, a day of intense badgering of every detail of my college experience. I can hardly wait. But wait, there are going to be more presents!! Sweeeet..."

Check your chemistry grade tomorrow on learn at UW for an especially

Congratulations, and GREAT WORK!

Good luck next semester, and have a great, well earned, break!

How the hell did I pull off an 100% on my chem final? Not only was it an exam; it was my <b> <u>FINAL</b></u> exam!! I guess that when I realized that I was done studying on tuesday night and that I couldn't learn any more, my brain wasn't full of shit. Now I'm just waiting to see how my final grade turned out! <crosses fingers> So yeah, now I'm chilling at home for the next month or so. Now I'm off to downstairs to plop my ass down in front of the TV for the next few hours.

After our meal that evening, we drove around Greenville to see what there was to see. And what we saw -- check-cashing stores and abject trailer parks, and some of the hardest-used cars for sale on a very rundown lot -- told us the people there were hurting economically and deserved more than they were getting...... 
The people of Alabama appear to be among the most generous and most unsung philanthropists in this country. What they give is unimaginable to many others and they give it time and again: They regularly give their turn at the American dream to someone else. And they give it simply because they're asked. So many people in Greenville don't seem to have basic healthcare coverage or promising job opportunities. Meanwhile, their children volunteer to risk their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. I can only be humbled by their sacrifice. 

But because I am a lawmaker and a student of history, I also know who has been asking them to give so much. And I can only wonder how many more generations of central Alabamians will say yes when the increasingly powerful Republican Party asks them to be concerned about homosexuality but not about the security of their own health, about abortion but not about the economic futures of their own children. As my wife and I drove through Greenville that night, I thought how fundamentally unfair this all is in order to support an increasingly radical conservative movement. 

Now, some may think that Alabama and Wisconsin are the polar opposites of American politics. But in both states I've found that -- along with sharing a sincere appreciation of a good turkey dinner -- too many hardworking people are losing their battles for decent paying jobs and adequate healthcare. I'm tired of seeing the power-hungry persuade the hardworking people of this country that the only way to preserve important values is to vote against their own families' basic interests. I believe that the working people of both states have sacrificed for other people's agendas for too long. And I believe that any political party or political movement or political candidate who would consistently say this would be heard throughout America. 

We need to go to the Greenvilles of every state, red and blue, and say, ""Thank you. You've sacrificed long enough. Now it's your turn at the American dream.""

"event","Well, the semester is almost over. I got my chem exam back on Wednesday and it turns out that I snagged a B. I always seem to be right at the top of the bell curve somehow. I'm pretty sure that I'm looking at getting a B overall for the semester. So on Thursday I decided to bail from Madison and go home. Friday I went to Chicago with my mom and my little brother. Went to the Christmas market again. It was fun (harassing Josh the whole time). Went to Old Navy and bought some clothes. I wanted to invest in something a little less scrubby. Watched movies last night until I fell asleep on the couch. Came back to Madison today around 2:30, then sat around for a while. I just finished getting ready for my French oral exam on tuesday. Now I'm just putting off studying for chem like I should. I'll get to it eventually tonight I guess. A few more days, then it's back home for another month of relaxation. I'm looking forward to second semester and having a totally different schedule with classes that I actually want to take.

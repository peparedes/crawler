Talked to my Grandma again this morning! (thats why I am up so flippin early!) But she is still tryna talk me into working...Amber said that I could have any both...Grandma is trying to get me to work in Icee's, Coz she'd rather have me than someone else..(And I guess Amber is more than willing to let me work in Icees..).I duno, I could, I have ran that both before...I helped with it for like 3 years so I would know how...But I duno...I dont feel like being trapped in a both all day...Actually no I wont be...Well, me and Amanda wernt going to tell the people at the Renaissance that I wasnt going to work untill like the 1st weekend if we couldnt work anything out, but Grandma went right ahead and told Amber and Laurie that I was thinking about not working...So Amber is calling me sometime within the next couple days...URG! I dont know what I am going to do..If I dont work I will still be out there every weekend helping out! Thats just the way it goes..This is me and Amanda's 5th year being out there together...And we're not going to stop! hahaha...But yah...I'm gonna go sleep! (I'm keeping an open mind though!)

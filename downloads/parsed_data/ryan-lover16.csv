I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds
Strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind
Pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy.. happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a backlit canopy
With holes punched in it
I'M counting UFOS
I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy.. happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here

The world's a roller coaster
And I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care
But my hands are busy in the air saying:

I wish you were here
I wish you were

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here"

 One thing you're sure to know about a Scorpio boy is that you really won't get to know him at all. Hey, these folks are mysterious! Oh well, that can be half the fun. 

Possessed of an almost mystical quality, Scorpio boys are alluring as a result of their kinda-naughty, almost-dangerous personalities. Although Scorpions often get a bad rap, there is a lot of interesting stuff beneath the surface. The Scorpio boy is a penetrating, probing sort, someone who is far from shallow. They'll want to get to know you to the core, and this relationship is likely to change you forever. And it will be plenty hot, as Scorpio is the Sign of Sex! Shy girls had better look elsewhere lest they get stung by the Scorpion's tail. As well, the Scorpio boy is the one who will call the shots in the relationship, letting his girl know who's in charge. 

Sports are a little bit of everything for this guy, so one day it's likely to be baseball and another day it's hoops. It's the nature of a Water sign to be a bit changeable after all. This helps to explain the Scorpion's mood swings, and why he may appear agreeable at first but wind up being quite the opposite. 

Bottom line: Fearless girls may choose to tread in the Scorpion's lair, but you'd better watch out! This is a dangerously appealing guy. 

Hot match-ups: The other Water Signs, Cancer and Pisces, but meticulous Virgo really brings you back down to Earth when you get carried away with one of your obsessions. This sweetie can ground you in reality!

Not-so-hot match-ups: Aquarius and Aries; these two are kind of aloof when it comes to amour, and you desire nothing less than totally profound connections."

"event","The Archer is a Fire sign: 'Nuff said, at least where sex is concerned. The initial Sagittarian response where sex is concerned is through physicality, as opposed to emotion or practicality. The Archer is not shy, and like the half beast/half human that he/she represents, is quite the sexual animal. In other words, these folks are always ready! Sagittarians like to enjoy many an erotic experience, in keeping with their outgoing and sociable nature. Their great libido also lends itself best to an artistic and graceful lover, qualities they very much admire. Trying new things is also often on the Archer's mind, and when their lover says sex on the beach, they had best not be referring to a fruity drink. The Sagittarian's thirst for knowledge is often quenched through straight talk in bed, a way to combine two of their favorite pleasures. Sagittarians can also grow to worship a worthy lover, a fitting response to this holiest of acts."

"event","Scorpio and Sagittarius

If a Scorpio and a Sagittarius want to make a love match, they should be warned to slow down, take their time getting to know one another on a deep, significant level or else they run the risk of getting way ahead of themselves. This relationship could be over before either partner even realizes it's started if they're not careful! Their patience will be very richly rewarded. Sagittarius thrives on change, on the new and the exciting and on the power of positive thought. Scorpio just wants to get closer and strengthen emotional ties. Early in the relationship, Sagittarius could feel hemmed in by Scorpio's rapt attention and high expectations for love. If Scorpio can control their emotions, these two are in for satisfaction and excitement. 

Both Scorpio and Sagittarius see each day as an adventure (or in Scorpio's case, a compelling mystery) and as an endless opportunity to explore, to probe, to learn. Shared escapades bring them closer. While Sagittarius may get fed up with Scorpio's stubbornness and inflexibility, Scorpio could be thinking their Sagittarius mate is just a little too hotheaded. They'll enjoy learning together, and travel could be very beneficial for this pair. Their relationship is always on the go! 

Pluto and Mars rule Scorpio, and Mars and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. Mars is the God of War, opening the door for Scorpio's determined, courageous character. Mars, when combined with Pluto, represents rebirth and renewal. Jupiter focuses on philosophy, higher learning, expansion, optimism, luck and travel. These planetary attributes -- of growth, expansion and masculine energy -- combine to create a sustainable relationship of mutual admiration. 

Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. Sagittarius is the spontaneous partner, heading in the direction their whim leads them, while Scorpio's motives are more subdued, less easy to read. Even if they run into misunderstandings or misinterpretations of each other's motivations, crisis can be averted. If these love mates agree that their relationship is significant, their devotion and affection will see them through. 

Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Both of these love mates can multitask like pros, keeping each other's interests at heart, juggling birthdays and special dates with family obligations, but it really takes Scorpio's follow-through to get anything finished in this pair. Sagittarius gets the urge to jump around from project to project, so Scorpio's stick-to-it-tivness comes in handy. Lucky for Scorp partners, Sagittarius notices all the work their mates put in -- and they definitely show their appreciation when they know it's needed. Scorpio can be stubborn, exacting and demanding, so this mate needs to give their Sagittarius love their personal space and time for their own interests. Scorpio leads Sagittarius' ideas fruition, even if Sagittarius has lost interest and moved on. So they're not all work and no play, Sagittarius comes through with their knack for flexibility, a positive quality that sometimes wins out over resolute determination. 

What's the best thing about the Scorpio-Sagittarius relationship? The security and flexibility they can give one another. Once they open up to one another and to appreciate their different philosophies in love and in life, these two have potential for steamy relations, deep connections and heartfelt respect. As long as they communicate and celebrate their differences, theirs will be a passionate relationship"

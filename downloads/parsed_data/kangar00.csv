Twas another SUCKY Thursday. I am sure you don't want to hear the gory details but entailed a lack of memory, a broken car, a touch, a girlfriend, me slipping, work


I want to rid my self of these thoughts. It isn't fair, but once again no one said it would be. 
There are so many things that I want to change, to alter. Moments in time that can't be mine and will forever be wanted. I don't think forever is a word I can use though because I have never had a forever. 

It would be easy to cuddle with someone now but I don't want to cuddle with someone, I want to cuddle with THE one.

I think this is a sad movie night....

I am sad that all my old senior friends are gone. I want to be where they are. I want to start a new chapter. I want to leave everything and everyone behind. I don't want to be me anymore. I can be someone else if I really tried. 

Sometimes my heart starts to hurt. Physically, because of the emotional pull of it. It's so silly to want it. I was watching the Prince and Me, and most people would think that the part that made me feel the most physical warmth and happiness would be the end. Instead, the part that I felt the most, the part I kept repeating, was the part when he reaches out and holds her hand. He plays with her hand. What's up with that....so simple....yet....

I get so tired of this house and this place. I think the walls could be moving in on me. I am excited about Senior year, although I feel like I am getting ready to go to college. Perhaps that is because I would rather be going to college. I am kinda 'cited about going to see Laura at VT once she gets settled in. She can show me a good time there, I can meet people that aren't from sucky Caroline!

"event","These past few weeks have flown by in such a slow procession I think sometimes everything is going backwards. A range of feelings have lifted me and up and brought me down. Treacherous ideas have filled my thoughts while, simple incidents have been over looked. I think I have over thought some things at the same time. So many things I fear may happen that I have become more timid than I ever have been. Fear chases my courage and my courage is becoming tired. I am not sure what is fueling this fear so much that it is able to over run my courage, but I must cut this source of fuel off. I fear that I may lose my position as goalie. I fear that people will just think of me as mean, even though I really am not that mean. I fear that I will chicken out on everything and take no chances and live in a safe world with all the same old scenarios. There will be no explosions here. I want something unusual something strange to call me to something exciting. 

Then there is my church which has fallen to the devil's grasp. That is the one safe place that I am supposed to be able to mmet God, but everything has changed there now. i don't think i can go back and that saddens me. I feel over run with thoughts and these thought may over run me because I am losing my strength and as my lose my strength those thoughts only go stronger.

I guess I am tired of everyone thinking I'm mean. Things seem to fall apart at the seams, both literally and figuratively. I guess I just need some space from all the people. Some space to be me, to be a happier version of me. Accepting the fact that bad things happen to good people could most possibly the most difficult thing ever.

   Those beautiful things that just make life worth living, those are the things I have been missing out on. With soccer starting back up soon, I know that will only add to my inspiration because of my pure love of the sport. Will that be enough though? I fearfully doubt it. 
   
   I guess I want more of a BIG BANG inspiration. Something to just wonderfully slide into my life like it was always just meant to be there. I think I need to get back to me. As much as I want everyone else to be right and everything else to be right....I think right now I just need to be alright. And you know what, I will be alright....because I am already feeling a lil inspired

This guy's head prolly can't fit through door ways, but I mean it's not that hard to see why. His personality on the other hand is highly lacking. He has a very small one track mind, which is such a waste. He cracks me up though because he is slightly lacking on money so he is a Chip&Dale dancer. Yea, what a hoot! So where does he get off saying things like ""Bye Beautiful"". Good looking older guys don't say that stuff to me. He must not have gotten that memo. I don't want to be so shallow to say I am absolutely flattered, but I am absolutely flattered. I think I got it though, he knows ALREADY that I am a goody, which is good, cuz he knows I have boundaries. He must know that I would never actually be intrested in him bc all he is an exterior. He likes to chase things that he will never catch, a challenge for one. Well I am one challenge that most guys never pursue, so we will see how long it takes him to get bored. I hope it's soon, b.c. it's kinda freaky.....lol

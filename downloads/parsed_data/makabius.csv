"event","Today was crazy with its weather, but I'm happy cause I got home in one piece.&nbsp; What I'm really happy about is that fact that I have someone special in my life now.&nbsp; I think she is the most beautiful lady in the world.&nbsp; Kinda weird for me to talk like this but, I like her and I'm glad she thinks the same of me.&nbsp; I don't get to see her as much as I'de like to, but I'm happy all the same when we do get to spend some time together.&nbsp; So, I say again, hug the one next to you, just like I will give her a very big hug next time we're together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

School is going ok for me, i'm prgressing faster than the teacher expected.&nbsp; I will be glad when I finish school though.&nbsp; Having to go to school for 4-7 hours then work for another 8 hours in one day 5 days a week kinda kills you.&nbsp; But in the end, it's worth it so I will be happy when it's all complete.&nbsp; Then I'll have more time to spend with the one I care for or more time to visit with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ever fealt like you have been looking for that one person for so long but thought you would never find them?&nbsp; That is how I currently feel about the one I have met.&nbsp; She has her querky side, but she also has her very beautiful side, one that makes up for any other fault that she might have.&nbsp; I wouldnt ask for any more or any less.&nbsp; *hugs Alyson*&nbsp; yay!!!

Well all have fun and take care."

"event","<p>I've been neglecting my posts, *slaps self* bad llama.&nbsp; Life is some what different now.&nbsp; My perspective on things continues to change.&nbsp; I see more and more of the things i don't want to see, and i see less of the things I do.&nbsp; Though, there are some things that I am glad have not changed.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, change is a good thing, but not every thing should change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I started going to beauty school recently, yah yah, i know, it sounds funny, weird, not for a man.&nbsp; But, you know, it's actually kinda fun, and I'm quite good at doing nails so far.&nbsp; I've already progressed farther than the teacher has expected so she is kinda lost as what to have me do.&nbsp; I am straight for those of you who are asking.&nbsp; It's just fun and well, it will pay good money when i get my license.<br /><br />One other thing that has been coming to my attention lately.&nbsp; I have noticed someone for the first time.&nbsp; I don't know what caused it or why, but i have starting feeling an attraction toward her.&nbsp; In my eyes she is quite beautiful.&nbsp; She has her faults, but the more this attraction grows, the more i wana help her with those faults.&nbsp; It's weird for me, I wanna get to know her more and get closer to her, but i don't know how or what it is II should do.&nbsp; I know, i should grow a backbone, but past experiences kinda make that hard.&nbsp; Oh well, i'll just get her to smile again next time I see her.<br /><br />This was a longer post than I was expecting to do, but that is fine.&nbsp; This feels good to do so I will do it.</p>"

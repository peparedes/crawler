To all those taht actually kept up with this, I am sorry, but I can not do this anymore. It is too impersonal. To those of you who know me, you know what is going on in my life. To those of you who do not, (last ditch attempt at humour) stop reading this, you sickos.

"event","Well, Pope John Paul II is dead.


I had two softball games today and my shoulders are painfully burned. OH! I washed my backpack. It's a little cleaner.

Yesterday, I made like, New Years Resolution like, four moths late. Whatever, four is my lucky number, maybe it'll stick, and if it does, well, I have a new tradition. Here they are:

1.Try not to put off homework until last minute, especially math.
2.Don't talk behind people's backs. It usually backfires, and right now all of my friends mean so much more to me that I don't want to lose  ANY of them. So, friends, don't try to get me to talk about people behind my backs. Unless they did something mean to me first.
3.Don't eat as much junkfood. I'm still haunted by the movies we've watched in Critical Thinking.
4.BE BOLD AND TELL THE NAMELESS PERSON HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM. And also, be more open with my feelings to my friends. Honesty may hurt, but I think in the long run it will cause less pain than otherwise.
5.Excersice more. Crap, I don't know how to spell that stupid word. I think I'm dyslexic or something. And I totally have A.D.H.D.
6.Stop cussing. URG! I hate it when I cuss because it sounds so VULGAR!! And I don't like it when I use those naughty words, so I'm going to try to stop.


I wonder what'll happen.

P.s.--My left hand hurts really bad. OucH!"

On the thirteenth day without a feeding tube, Terry Shiavo has died. And Michael Shiavo wouldn't even let the people who CARED ABOUT HER go into see her. What kind of a world are we living in??????????????????

Pope John Paul II is dying.

"event","Sadly, this might be my last Lj entry for a while, considering a Mexican is moving into my sister's room from today and moving out on Thursday. Gosh, not that I've got anything agaisnt Mexicans. But it'll be weird. Like, I can't come in here to go on the computer or anything. I don't even know if she speaks English or not! And it might smell all weird afterwards because of her. Ok, that came out wrong. What I meant was; people have different smells. Like, Jess smells like Cawthon Hall because that is where she lives. I probably smell like this house, because that is where I live. And sometimes the smells of different houses differ from one another because they're, well, different. To myself, I smell fine, but to other people I may smell like roses or crap. It depends on the type of smell they harbor around themselves. If that makes no sense whatsoever to you, just comment me and I'll try to explain it.

So back to the Mexican people. I have to dress up all nice and stuff for them. At least i won't see them that often as I have softball practice on Monday, a game on Tuesday, and a bari. lesson on Wednesday. And then on Thursday when I do absolutely nothing, they are gone. FREEDOM. I don't know, maybe we'll have fun. But Rehina (the girl that is moving in my sister's room) is 12, and I hope she's not one of those real snotty ones that think they're better than the 14 yr old loser who's bedroom is next to hers. (me). I don't know, the last memory I have of her is her getting in trouble by her mom for dipping her hand in black ink and imprinting it onto the white wall. But she was 4. 

OMG! I think I have to share a bathroom with her!! That would be bad. 
OMG! I hope my parents and her parents don't force her to go to school with me or something to show her what a ""real American school is like""!!!!! That would be so bad, her trailing me everywhere. And I don't even know if she speaks English!!!!!

What am I going to do????????

All I can say is, if I start acting completely insane (more than usual) at school, you'll know why.


Why did my mom have to go to freakin' MEXICO when she was 16. Why did she have to keep in contact with them???


WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?"

"event","Promises mean everything, but after they're broken, sorry means nothing.--I saw that on someone's profile. I just kind of stared out at for a few seconds, because whoever said that, is a genius. OK.

Today (even though it was horribly rainy and gross) my tournament team had a carwash. And some of us stood by the exit doors at Sam's Club and bombarded the people who came out of the store asking them if they would like to make donations. A gay couple came out, it was soo funny! The black guy said no, but his white (partner?) turned around and gave us two bucks. We made about four hundred dollars, and then Sam's doubled it. So we have about eight hundred dollars. I got in a hose fight with Monica, Maxine, and Jeremy. Maxine sat on a fudge brownie and it went through her sofie's and onto her bottom piece. We also dodged traffic and hit up a cop in a cop car for money.


On Thursday, I went and saw Miss Congeniality: Armed and Fabulous with Rose. It was really good (or I think so at least). Oh, it was soo funny at the concession booth. For just a quarter more....Just take the damn quarter, buddy! Oh, and he gave me Snickers Popables instead of 3 Musketeers, but because of the whole quarter thing, I was just like, screw that. I like Snickers too.
My mom decided to skip church on Thursday, so I went home and talked to Moriah, and then she came over later to watch Finding Neverland. In the middle of the movie we paused it so I could show her my Barbie house. NO! It is like, a Barbie MANSION!! It's huge, but now it mainly stores old softball gear in the garage. And then we went back and I had to put my gum on hers when we got our popcorn. She started tearing up at the end again. *Sigh*

On Friday, Jess came home. Me and Joey (and Jess when she got home) watched Disney's Peter Pan. It was soo much funnier than I had remembered it. I woke up on noon on Friday! It felt....odd!

P.S.-I was scrolling the moods, and I looked and one said 'horny', and I was like, OMG! What kind of picture do they put for that?? Curiosity overcoming the pure and innocent side of me, I looked, and it was a cat winking. Sick."

"event","I know it is wrong to hate, but I simply hate Michael Schiavo, his attorney, and the judges who are killing Terry. I hope that they have a reserved place in hell for them when they die. TERRY IS A LIVING PERSON, no matter her condition, and what they are doing--they should be tried, and condemned for murder. HOW ABOUT IF WE KILL OFF MICHAEL SCHIAVO. Give him the damn electric chair. Yeah, how do you feel about death now, Mike? How about we screw you up in the head and pull your plug? So your stupid fiancee can collect YOUR life insurance. I HATE him. I think when they bury Terry's body, they should have her name as Terry Schindler. 
Do the state legislatures WANT Terry dead??????
What kind of world do we live in that kills people simply because of the way their brain functions.

Go to hell, Michael Shiavo."

"event","Yesterday I was bored of watching TV and being on the computer, so I swam eighty laps in the pool. And then I called Moriah on her cellphone in Tampa and she was all ""CIVILIZATION!!!"" Oh, and I went to church and it was like, a reconciliation thingy and I had to go up in line and confeess one of my sins, and it was really weird, but at least I didn't have to tell it to Fr. John or Fr. George. And then I thought that they gave you a pennance or whatever or advice or something, but SILLY ME. They just do a bunch of stuff they've memorized out of like, Preacher's Handbook or whatever. I tried to ask Joey what he said, but he was all like ""That is between me and God."" He probably raped someone or something. All I can say is, it was pretty nervewracking, and no wonder my mom faked sick to stay home. OH MY GOD!! You know how LAME that is!? SHE FAKED SICK!!! That is something I am supposed to do, but no, my MOM did it.

 Yesterday, Joey molested me with his lacrosse stick!!! No joke! We were playing catch and then it turned into 'who can get the ball first' and I was going for it, and I almost had it and then Joey stuck his lacrosse stick between my legs to try to fend my stick off the ball and he pulled up! It was soo gross!! And I was like ""Eww Joey! Stop it!"" And he was like, ""Give me the ball!"" Then I turned around and whacked him with the stick and sprinted home.

Well, my mom just made us sandwiches *gag* so I have to go."

"event","I'm extremely bored. Ok, here's a good prank;

     The next time you're at an airport, look for people who are checking their flights, ok. 
Wait till they look away and then walk up to them. Don't say anything, wait till they just look
up at you because they can FEEL you there. When they look up at you, really seriously say, ""Don't
get on that flight."" Because, I swear, they're gonna be thinking, 'I don't think I should get on 
this freaking flight.'

Have fun!

 Anyways...

I come home and my parents are watching this musical with Kelsey Grammar in it, and it scares me so I'm not watching it. It's a mest-up version of A Christmas Carol. 

Oh, Dane Cook is the funniest comedian in the world. If you want to listen to him, look for Speak N' Spell, Just Wanna Dance, and Not So Kool-Aid.

We didn't get done until 11:10ish i think. But I got soo tired that I was being all random. And I knocked the trashcan thing over and ate some paper. Just two little pieces though. And when Vick brought us popcorn I ate two-thirds of it. When I left we sang the death cat march and went streaking with our rubbers. We did not die. cough. Ahem, I am the pink ranger now..I forgot how that came up. Whatever. It was too late at night for me to remember. Ciao.

Earlier me her and Adam were relating our childhood stories. wELl, I was relating my childhood stories and they were listening. One thing I discovered about myself while telling these stories were: I had a very traumatizing childhood. Seriously. When I was a baby I was flipped upside-down in a shopping cart, my brother let me out of the house, and..Moriah is calling me again. I've got a red ribbon-string thingy on my finger so I remember to bring in cans for the can food drive so that way Latin will win for the fourth year in a row. Hence the song I'm humming to myslef right now. Oh and yesterday the fourth chair baritone kid started stalking me in the hallways. I have known (I heard him telling one of his friends) for a week that he has had a crush on me. Oh boy. Too bad I like someone else. And that he has a girlfriend. I think.
Oh well. Caio"

  Actually I do. Yesterday my sister turned nineteen. HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSICA. I really miss her. Today I tried to tell Victoria, Jenny, and Rose what happened the day she left, but I couldn't because I started to cry, almost. So I'll do right here, because I don't cry when I write things and if I do, you can't see me cry.
   
      It was the weekend of hurricane Charley, so of course the whole weekend was going to be a fluke. Except, it wasn't even the weekend yet. It was Thursday, and before school started Jess took me and Joe for breakfast. Everything was fine then. But in the afternoon it was really different. Twenty minutes before she left we lay on my bed, and I twirled her hair. As I was twirling her hair I started crying because I knew how much I was going to miss her. After ten minutes of trying not to let her notice she turned to me and asked, ""Were you crying?"" I nodded and she said, ""I thought so because my hair felt wet."" It made me cry even more.
      It was time for her to go. Joey had to go first so he hugged her good-bye, picked her up, and said, ""I'll miss you."" He left. We said good-bye in the kitchen, only me and Jess because mom and dad were driving her up. I was determined not to cry but when I hugged her I started. She started crying too. Then my mom started crying. And then my dad started crying. And then my dog started crying. (Just kidding, but I thought you need some comic relief at that point.) Anyways, I said ""Goodbye Jess, I'll miss you, I love you."" She said that she would miss me too, and that she loved me too. Then, they left.
   Almost. As they closed the door I sat down in the hallway and started crying harder. Then my mom callewd me and told me they were coming back because she left her sunglasses. Jess and dad stayed in the car. I couldn't bring myself to go out to say good-bye one last time. I peered out the window and saw my sister looking in the direction of my room. I waved, and she waved back. We watched each other until my mom found her sunglasses, left the house to the car, and they drove away. And then she was gone."

Man Caught Peeping In Toilet
Police were called to a parking lot in Winter Springs, Monday afternoon where they caughta man identified as Rose Spalding. Apparently, he had dressed himself in clothing madeof trash bags and crawled into a portable toilet. A woman discovered Rose vomiting onhimself and gasping for air in the 130 degree temperatures. Police had to cut the toilet opento remove Spalding. ""We don't even know how he managed to get in there in the first place."" Said Officer Jack O'Conner. When asked why he was in the portable toilet, Spalding responded, ""I waslooking for treasure."" Spalding will be sent to the Sunnydale Mental Health Facility in Sunnydale, California for mental analysis and observation. Officials suspect that he may have beenhiding in the portable toilet for nearly 6 hours, until the midday sun heated it to nearlylethal temperatures. Why he was hiding in the toilet is still unclear. But, they do know thathe was lucky to get out alive.

Deputies hosed Spalding off before letting him into the back of their car, where he was then escorted tothe police station for questioning."

Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena<br>(Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya<br>(Indian).
The Dragon is associated with the concept of<br>intelligence, the number 5, and the element of<br>wood.
His sign is the crescent moon.

As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and<br>wise individual.  You weigh options by looking<br>at how logical they are and you know that while<br>there may not always be a right or wrong<br>choice, there is always a logical one.

And then she hid under my legs and Joey tried to grab her and I was like, 'Whoa now'. And then Lilly started biting and growling at him. And he was like, 'I'm getting the leash.' And then Lilly started licking me because I was helping her. And the Joe came back with the leash and yanked her out and she bit him. The end.

         Pissed on Thursday Morning
OK, I was like, three minutes late to the bus stop (and my busdriver Mrs. Elfy is a mean old lady who should have retired 20 years ago will stop for no one except the frickin retarded kids) and my mom was like 'take the mail out'. And I was like, 'I have no time!' And then she said 'Oh yes you do!' So I took the mail out and I started rearranging myself at the bus stop when Michael came up to me and told me 'I was gonna throw this dead snake on you, but you looked really pissed when you came out, so I decided not to.' End"

"event","This is my first entry! Yea. I'm just waiting for my softball game tomorrow which I'm not looking forward to. Oh yes, this is also the first day of spring break. Yesterday I thought it was Friday so I was wondering why my daddy put meat in my lunch. So my mom had to explain stuff to me. Sloane had a major freak-out moment in Geo. All of a sudden she turns around and screams at Dono 'Let go Dono!!' She sounded like my mommy.
And now my brother is fighting a battle against my doggie and it sounds like she's winning. Haha."

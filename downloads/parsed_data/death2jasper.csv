<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/D/donarepa/1065683791_ampirequiz.JPG"" border=""0"" alt=""vamp""><br>You are Form 9, <b>Vampire</b>: The Undying.

<i>""And The Vampire was all that remained on<br>the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to<br>regrow life from the dead.  But as she was<br>about to give the breath of life, she was<br>consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the<br>cycle began again.""</i>

Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek)<br>and Isis (Egyptian).
The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.

As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic<br>individual.  You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times.  While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

So Beth went and picked her up in seattle.. long fucking story that no one cares about. I'm just glad nic and beth are getting a long. It was good to see her play drums again. She getting so good, and she looks so damn hot when shes playing too... Jasper, Beth, Nic and I are going to the Gatsby show and gonna kick it after. Should be a blast.

"event","shes starting to lose count of how many times people have said, ""It will get better.""
and her life is falling apart right infront of her eyes, but shes crying so much that she can't see it
There is never any place for someone like her to be totally happy.
Oh joy, another day not wanting to wake up
another day waiting to upset someone
another day to starve myself
another day to cry
another day to hurt
another day to wait for the end
She tries so hard not to be defeated by herself but its a never winning game and everytime she fails all she hears is loser
a broken gurl who cries everynight and fakes a smile everyday
You'd never guess a girl so happy on the outside is breaking down on the inside.
A girl who laughs her head off everyday in school; 
you'd never guess she's covering up the million tears behind her s m i l e .
If you look into her eyes you will see the hurt she feels
She's the type of girl that can be hurt,but can still look at you and smile,the type of girl who is willing to brighten you're day even if she can't brighten her own.
and shes too far gone to be saved"

"event","im going downtown today although i feel really  bad about it cause i was supposed to go to daves and watch him and the pez heads practice but instead im going downtown and i feel really bad and stupid again. and im sorry dave and amanda cause lately ive been being a meanie and well thats not really me. i miss me...the old me. Frankly, i think everyone misses the old person they used to be. I want sixth grade back so much me meg heather and alex had so much fun that year. everyone was so nice in sixth grade and didnt give a shit about wat anybody else said. Everyone was so carefree and now its completely opposite. 
oh and heather...i appreciate you so much you are by far the best person and i couldnt live with out you . you too jake...thanks for talking n stuff and putting up with my complainging about shit.
i want it to be summer!"

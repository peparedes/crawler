and forced me to cough, hurt, throw-up and not sleep. DIE!
And since not going to school today put me in the red zone for
a penalty F for absences, mummy was a little aprhensive. 
Tomorrow i will drudge through the day looking like Edward-scissor-hands
and hacking like a witch.

Too dramatic? yeah- still not feeling up to par.
sorry to those who happen to love winter and snow
but i would be just fine if it never came again."

The vet said he had brain swelling and neurological damage. so, how he did this, i don't know and i'm freakin' pissed off because now i have to put him down. why do my babies die( if you don't know me, i love all animals and treat them as if they are my children so to speak)? It breaks me heart. 

Today a bizarre thing happend. my car rolled away and hit another car. bashed the drivers side door. so this is great, a 1,000 dollars i don't have because i fuckin' don't have a job. i am picky, so i know i shouldn't complain. Just what i needed to top everything off. Now grades are gonna come out and they aren't the best but decent. i don't need the lecture at all.
just trust me
it will be fine."

"event","Last night i was having one of those nights where you just think of everything and anything.
I started thinking about the little pleasures i enjoy, so i've decided to share them with you
and hope you would share some with me.
1. The soft feel of my legs after a shave
2. Working in my little garden
3. Having my kitty and puppy
4. Getting magazines and even junk mail in the mail.
5. Walking out to get the mail. (it's like an obsession)
6. The sound of the dishwasher
7. Finding an amazing sale (in all areas!)
8. sounds corny- but i love walking on the beach, close to the water or ankle deep
9. finally getting that beauty idea in a magazine right
10. A shower radio :)

Unlike-able things

Stinky seaweed/water smell
Not fully erasing stuff on the board
Repeating myself
Being splashed
The TV/ Radio/ Peoples voices, and anything else that is loud
Contradicting me when i am positively right
Surprises
My Uncle Jim in every aspect
Days over 70 degrees and under 55
yeh... enough is enough

after work mom drive me to the ferry to meet up with the Baglio's, Javan, and Elisa. upon arriving in seattle we head down to a place called the Melting Pot. It's a fondu place. Food was nummy but desert was the best. afterwards we went to see the play Grease at the Paramount. My first play and first time in the paramount. that place is gorgeous. And of all the people i see Pip and her gang there! :)Fun! Frankie Avalon was there(he sings beauty school drop-out). After the play Brennen, Javan, Cassondra, and I walk to the car while The others went to the truck. Brennen driving in the midst of Seattle traffic- uhg. Every time they saw a showgirls sign they would crack up histarically. well we missed the ferry so then we take the highway. Brennen was driving really fast and me and cassondra stuck our heads out the window and let our hair fly. Javan did this also but afterwards he had an afro! Me and cassondra fell asleep for a while. Brennen kindly drove me home, even after all the horrible directions i gave him. I arrived home at 12:16. and here i am at work again with a good 6 hours of sleep. hah!

Your birth on the 25th day of the month (7 energy) modifies your life path by giving you some special interest in technical, scientific, or other complex and often hard to understand subjects. 

You may become something of a perfectionist and a stickler for details. 

Your thinking is logical and intuitive, rational and responsible. 



Your feelings may run deep, but you are not very likely to let them show. 

This birthday makes you a more private person, more introspective and perhaps more inflexible. 

In friendships you are very cautious and reserved. 

You are probably inventive, and given to unique approaches and solutions.</td>

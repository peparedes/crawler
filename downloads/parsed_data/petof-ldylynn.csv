anywyas i took her out so when i come home hte first thing iwill do is clean there cage thurally, having to be inthere with a dead rat and everyone gets lots of treats

but im still not sure hy she died they have had plenty of foodand water, i dontk now, it dosntreally matter i guess.  poor tara."

"event","woke up yesturday bout 15mins before i needed to leave, was telling myself im not gonna go and will jsut drop the class cause im gonna fail anyways, but forsomtimes i jumped up and got dressed an went, see trying to not be deppressed but not easy.

speed a lil on the way to class, but most was jsut luck cuase hte roads were really open, got there in plenty of time. did get my paper back, got a 63, im not sure if that was before or after the -10 points for being late.  on my paper he stated a couple times i should get a tutor.... how do i get a tutor in writing *sigh* i really suck at core classes and at writting and englsh in paticular.

asked Mistress to eat lunch with me, mainly so i owuld have an excuse not to go strait home. She has to call and check what her fam was doing to see if she had time. she did but wanted to take seprate cars, so she could leave afterwords, insteado f me droppingher off. and we couldnt think of a place and i started getting upset so i told her never mind and walked off. never doen that before. *sigh* but i didnt wanna get upset tho i did anyways jsutn ot very much only cryed lil got myself to stop. 

i did that aout yesturday started feeling like i was freaking out or osmthing, thats jsut how i felt when i lived here before and i hate that feeling. no wonder i practicly went catatonic >.<

anywyas stopped by subway got meatball sub ate the chips on way home but waited to eat sub till in my room, was very very very nummy they changed theere meatballs tho they are smaller now but very good

someone from the chat room was kind enoguh to tell me when sin was onlien and what name. i signed onto the SN i made recently for my website and messaged him, kinda obviouse its me i was surprised when i got a reply.  the story.... hit gf ""made"" him to stop talking to me and  now threated to dump him if he visted me. why he dosnt see anythign wrong with a bf or gf tellingthem that they cant talk to there best friend is beyoned me i mean htey make school pecials abou it for crying out loud.  

He is tlakingto me now. i didnt do too much of a guilt trip mainly i was jsut happy to be talking to him. makes mefeel better to think i have a friend. altho latly 2 other online friends have been really great at making me feel better. tho i in purposely gave him one when i said i wished i was able to talk to him last night when freaking out about my brother kicking me door in, seems he was online....

he isnt gonna bring up the topic with his gf that he is talking ot me again, but said he wont deny it. i know she will eventually wsay somthignthen get mad at him. and be a bitch and try to get him to stop all contact with me again. Tho i bet she was real happy when she got to delte me off his friends page on his site (she updates it for him) now she is the only person on his friends page. she outta be very proud of herself dont you think... 

found somting that makes me smile and feel happy even tho i feel as bad as i do. Molly. i got her out for the cam and had lots of fun watchign her run around and play on my desk.  today rats get cage clean out. weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

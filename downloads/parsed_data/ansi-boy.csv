"event","I am a person who is normally oblivious of the environment but there are a few changes which have been getting on my nerves recently. The <a href=""http://forum.java.sun.com/index.jspa"">Java forum</a> is one of them. The administrators have been making a lot of changes and introducing so many features (<em>read</em> bugs) that most of the friends I made are on the verge of quitting there. I think I'll follow suit.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I find Sun's approach very similar to our top management. They [our top management] conduct surveys and polls and carefully manipulate them to always get a satisfaction of above 95%. Every other person in the company is dissatisfied by most of the recent decisions of the top management. I would rather say that they got a ""satisfied"" response of 59% and reversed the digits. Sun has been doing much like that. I remember not getting a response for 18 feedbacks so far. Some of them were a minor requests to make a particular view consistent with the other; the rest were bugs... really annoying ones.<br /><br />Right now, I feel the best place for me is my code. Let me not think of other people's bugs while my own code bugs me."

"event","This is a part of a mail which has been circulating amongst several girls in many of our offices. One of them, who has been a good friend recently, forwarded it to me with some comments based on the way she judges me. I wonder who started all this in the first place. <br /><br /><font color=""#0000ff"">1. Guys don't actually look after good-looking girls. they prefer neat and presentable girls.<br />2. Guys hate flirts.<br />3.When a guy says he doesn't understand you, it simply means you're not thinking the way he is. <br />4. Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly! y care about.<br />5. When a guy really likes you, he'll disregard all your bad characteristics. <br />6. Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.<br />7. Guys will do anything just to get the girl's attention.<br />8. When you touch a guy's heart, there's no turning back.<br />9. When a girl says ""no"", a guy hears it as ""try again tomorrow"" ... so true. <br />10. You have to tell a guy what you really want before he gets the message clearly. <br />11. Guys love their moms.<br />12. A guy would sacrifice his money for lunch just to get you a couple of roses. <br />13. A guy often thinks about the girl who likes him. But this doesn't mean that the guy likes her. <br />14. You can never understand him unless you listen to him.<br />15. If a guy tells you he loves you once in a lifetime. He does.<br />16. Beware. Guys can make gossips scatter through half of the face of the earth faster than girls can. <br />17. Like Eve, girls are guys' weaknesses.<br />18. Guys are very open about themselves.<br />19. It's good to test a guy first before you believe him. But don't let him wait that long. <br />20. Guys hate it when their clothes get dirty. Even a small dot.<br />21. Guys really admire girls that they like even if they're not that much pretty. <br />22. If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice ... very true.<br />23. A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.<br />24. Guys cannot keep secrets that girls tell them.<br />25. Guys think too much.<br />26. Guys fantasies are unlimited.<br />27. Girls' height doesn't really matter to a guy but her weight does! ... very true.<br />28. Guys tend to get serious with their relationship and become too possessive. So watch out girls!!!<br />29. Guys are more talkative than girls are especially when the topic is about girls.<br />30. You can truly say that a guy has good intentions if you see him praying sometimes.<br />31. If a guy says you're beautiful, that guy likes you.<br />32. Guys hate girls who overreact.<br />33. Guys love you more than you love them IF they are serious in your relationships.<br /><br /><font color=""#000000"">I am in disagreement with most of the points. </font><br /></font>"

The other day, on of my colleague commented that people (within the company) at offshore are not doing anything. I simply could not control myself and I found myself arguing within no time. It was what I term as an ""emotional trigger"". I have been working for more than a year on this project from offshore and still people would say that I, being a part of the group, does not work. To think, these morons sitting here are logged into Yahoo Messenger all day and at best, they only know how to take/share the credit without putting any effort. It's a great advantage to them for interacting with the client directly. It's the same... every dog has his day and this dog has been waiting for his day for nothing.

A similar conversation erupted on the JDC and lead to remarks on India rather than me. I, being the hyper-sensitive, when it comes to my country, was irritated and started a flaming frenzy. I guess that caused too much of collateral damage. I wonder if I should stay calm or continue being like this, given my reputation of being non-social."

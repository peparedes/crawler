"event","ok i havent updated in a few days, i need to start with what happened sunday at the ass-crack of dawn. I was sleeping soundly, had been since 1:55am when i crashed. at 4:55 i was awoken by the sounds of banging on my door and my friend screaming ""Jess get up!!!""...since i was half asleep i responded with a simple ""hang on a minute"" and rolled over. She then yelled again ""Jess get up now, theres a fire"" and all i can remember saying was ""oh fuck"". i jumped out of my bed and pulled a pair of pants on over my shorts...grabbed a hoodie, flipflops and my room key. i walked into the hallway holding my hoodie, and immediately had to cover my face because of the smoke in the hallway. i ran for the stairs and got out of the building. once we were outside my friend explained to me that there was a fire in the girls bathroom right across the hall from my dorm room. i definately think that was the scariest moment of my life. it was awful. they finally let all the students back into the building, but everyone form my floor had to wait in the 7th floor lounge for a while. By 6:15 i was climbing back into my nice warm bed. I slept until 2:30 that afternoon. stupid fires! If it werent for my friend though, i would never have woken up to the alarms. i was out cold and i had a towel at the base of the door to stop drafts. so i would never have smelled smoke either. yup, i would have become toast.

ok can someone please tell me why i cant sleep at night anymore? i just cant seem to sleep well. if anyone has a solution, please, be a dear and let me know!

peace"

<h2>You Are Submissive!</h2>
Pain may or may not be your thing, but chances are at least a little spanking turns you on.<br>
Submissive doesn't mean your a masochist (though you could be!)<br>
It means you like your lover to take charge ... and take care of you<br>
In return, you like to worship your partner - in whatever way (s)he wants!

"event","well, last night was girls night out. 4 of us went out to fubar and played some pool, played the jukebox and then headed back to the dorms. we got changed real fast and then headed over to the zeta beta tau frat house, which isnt really a frat house its just some guys in the frat with an apartment together. we had a few beers and chilled there for a while, then we headed off to witch doctors for some dancing fun. it was awesome. my legs are real sore from dancing but its all good. i had a blast. my one friend got hit real hard by a shot so we ended up taking her back here and making sure she felt better before she went to bed. i finally went to sleep around 5am. my neighbor came and knocked on my door at 1 and woke me up. we went to Plate-Ohs for lunch with one of our other friends. We just got back and im going to give my friend a call and then maybe take a nap. i might be going home next weekend. my friend wants to go to NYC friday night, and he has a car. so he might take me home and stay at my place for the weekend. im excited, this time it looks like it actually may happen that i get to go home. well i have nothing else to write as of now, and im very sleepy..peace"

"event","well, last nite was really cool. i got to meet one of my friends from friendster...real cool guy, made me laugh a lot. another friend of mine said we made a ""cute couple"", i thought that was kinda nifty. we went to fubar with a few other people. i played pool against my friend and i beat her, then i played against my friend from online and won again, i was surprised i won though because i had 2 whiskey sours. normally when i drink i cant play pool for shit. we hung out at the bar for a while, played songs on the jukebox, i had a couple more drinks...as did everyone else for the most part. i got a complimentary shot which was soco and peach schnapps, it was soooo yummy. i got back to my room around 12 and changed, then went down to my friends room on the 3rd floor to hang out. came back up here around 1 and i was sitting online chatting with a few people. and around 130 the fire alarms went off, so i grabbed my slippers and woke up my roomie and her boyfriend and went outside. it was freezing cold and flurrying and everyone was out there in pajams with blankets wrapped around them and stuff. we didnt come back into the dorm until around 2am. it was sooo cold out. i was pissed off. i went to sleep a little while after that and woke up around 1130 this morning. 

i played hackey sack in the square outside the union again. it seems to be something i do every tuesday and wednesday during bengal paws. hung out with some friends for a while...they left and my other friend came up to visit. just got back from my awful dinner in the dining hall. it was hotdog and hamburger night, needless to say i had a salad. so now im sitting in my room, listening to some music and minding my own business...what fun.

"event","im sitting here in my dorm room, alone as usual...listening to Brand New. This place definately gets boring at times. Theres definately a plus to hardly ever having a roomie, i can sing. I like to sing, but i know i suck at it so i dont like to do it around people. so ive been getting more and more homesick. thanksgiving isnt coming fast enough. all of my friends here carry on about how theyre going home soon and for halloween, and im like ""yup im fuckin stuck here as usual"". oh well i guess shit happens. i really want to see my family again, and i know i say this a lot, but i miss them. i realize now how much i love them, now that im not there around them everyday. they sent me a care package today, i cant wait to get it. i love getting stuff in the mail, even just little notes and cards to say hello. im such a sad case, i know.

is it normal to be so bored all the time? is it normal to hate sitting in my room alone and yet at the same time want to be alone? my mind is swimming with questions sometimes. i wish i didnt have to think half the time. thinking always causes me to get into trouble. whatever....

school is going well, wrapping up a long weekend. the weekend was kind of boring actually. hung out with a couple of people, but thats about it. i cant wait to go home for thanksgiving...i miss my family a lot. they are sending me a care package tomorrow, my friend sent me one too, i feel loved. i never get mail so it will be nice.

so im sitting here along in my dorm room, listening to brand new. being a recluse as usual. i just havent been in the socializing mood. same thing with drinking, i cant do it anymore. every time i drink i puke. its psychosomatic. i dont know how ill ever get over it, but whatever. 

well nothing much else to write, and i know ive bored whoever reads this bullshit enough. peace"

Passed out on the overpass 
sunday best and broken glass 
broken down from the bikes and bars suspended like spirits over speeding cars 
you and me were kings over the parkway tonight 
and tonight will go on forever while we 
walk around this town like we own the streets 
and stay awake through summer like we own the heat 
singing everybody wake up its time to get down 
(everybody wake up, wake up everybody, everybody wake up its time to get down)
and when i pass the bottle back to Pete on the overpass tonight i bet we laugh 

i'm gonna stay 18 forever 
so we can stay like this forever 
and we'll never miss a party 
cuz we keep them going constantly 
and we'll never have to listen to anyone about anything 
cuz it's all been done and its all been said we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get 

the hell out of this town 
find some conversation 
the low fuel light's been on for days 
doesn't mean anyhting i've got another 500 another 500 miles before we shut this engine down
we shut it down 

i'm gonna stay 18 forever 
so we can stay like this forever 
and we'll never miss a party cuz we keep them going constantly 
and we'll never have to listen 
to anyone about anything 
cuz it's all be done and its all been said we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get 

18 forever

and we'll never miss a party cuz we keep them going constantly 
and we'll never have to listen

just jealous cuz we're young and in love 
you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love 
you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love 
you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love 
you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love 
you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love

"event","there is one thing i enjoy about drinking, i have never had a hang over. i puke more often than not...but no hang over. Last nite was one of those puke nights. i havent drank in a long ass time...and i played 2 games of beer pong in which my partner and i lost both. he felt bad because i got fucked up playing, oh well its my fault in a way. so yeah, my partner was one of the frat brothers, he was real cool. before we were drinking we were talking about thursday and alkaline trio. he walked my friend and i back to elmwood, and then went his own way to the bar. 
now im sitting here, in my room, listening to music to drown out the shitty rap that someone below me is blasting. fuckin bullshit. now i know why this is called the porter projects. lol. 
ive gotta do some shopping, i need food in my room, this blows. i hope my parents throw some money in my account. i need a job bad, i need my car to have a job though. this sucks ass. well nothing else to write for now...."

Beyond Control

By Goose....for me

Does it really matter what people
Ever think about you?
I know, It's hard 
And that the pain is hard
Sometimes you have to know
When to say that they are wrong
And pass those fucks off for the shit they are

I can't control myself
Is this my life?
I don't like myself
I don't know myself
I wish i could find a better me
Do you know where i am?
Do you know who i am?

Don't try and run away from
What you feel deep inside
The possibilities that you know
Aren't meant to be held inside forever
JUST DON'T LET THEM GO!

I can't control myself
Is this my life?
I don't like myself
I don't know myself
I wish i could find a better me
Do you know where i am?
Do you know who i am?

Beyond control
This life seems like it's beyond control!
Beyond control
My life seems like i have no control!


leave me comments on what you think"

You don't remember me,
But I remember you.
I lie awake and try so hard,
Not to think of you.
But who (who) can (can) decide,
What they dream ?
And dream I do...
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
Have you forgotten all I know,
And all we had ?
You saw me mourning my love for you,
And touched my hand.
I knew you loved me then.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I look in the mirror and see your face.
If I look deep enough.
So many things inside that are just like you are<br>taking over.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me,
(You're taking over me),
You're taking over me,
(Taking over me), Taking over me.

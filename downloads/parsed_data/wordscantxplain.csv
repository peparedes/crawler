<P>im having such an off night. no reason really, just kind of bummed i guess. not really because of you, but because of me. its my fault things are the way they are. i act like i have no control over what goes on in my life and i do. it was up to me and <STRONG>i blew it</STRONG>. even if it was the smallest chance in the world.. i still had it and i didnt use it to my advantage. instead i made silly excuses as to why i shouldnt go for it. <U>i lost</U> what i had been waiting for, for so long and now its beyond to&nbsp;late. im so dissappointed in myself and sad about the fact that i could be doing something so much more entertaining than sitting here sulking about things that arent going to change. i beginning to think that there was nothing there in the first place. </P>
<P>i cant look at your picture. your the 8th picture down and all i keep doing is glancing at the stack n then feeling like im being crushed all over again. this is quite fun. i love spending my saterday nights thinking about you and all the things that could have happened but never will. this is beyond pathetic and i hate with a passion online diarys. </P>
<P>they pass the time though. <STRONG>i just want to fast forward to the part where we fall in love and live happily ever after.</STRONG> i think that is just to much to ask for though. my imagination is running away with me tonite. blah. </P>
<P>i wish i knew how you felt about me. what you really thought. whether its good or bad i just want to know. sometimes i can't tell if you really hate me or if you just act like it but really you dont think im that bad. i dont get you at all and im afraid to ask. im afraid to like talk to you. <U>i dont want to make things worse</U>. i have this dumb idea of how we would be n it simply wont go away. why do i like some1 that im afraid to talk to? no idea. i wont deny it ne more though. no matter how much i dont want to feel this way, i do. im fucking pathetic.</P>
<P>im listening to brand new and i love them. <STRONG>i just feel like crying</STRONG>. maybe that will make me feel better. i dont deserve you. i dont deserve you at all :'(. &lt;3kelly</P>
<P>this song makes me so sad:'(. i wish you werent horrible, horrible to me. i fell for all the empty words you said. </P></FONT>"

<P>well i just got home. went home early.. school is just not poppin these days. its sad to once had loved something with everything you had to only grow to hate it. oh well. life goes on. </P>
<P>67 n math. im dissappointed. the more i try the worse i do. i think ive just decided that im simply dumb. half kidding. blah, no big=)</P>
<P>so i think ill write an entry that actually means something rather then the norm ""today was a good day! yippee skippy"".&nbsp;but today in fact was good..me,tracey,sandis talk this morning-priceless=). but moving on..</P>
<P>ill start off with <EM>you</EM>(girl). you know.. i think that its terrible how you put on an act like that. maybe i was naive to think that you actually wanted to be friends with me b/c of me? thats what normal people do. i think its horrible how you put yourself out to be some one your not <STRONG><U>by far</U></STRONG>. your no better than anyone else and i find it funny that you think you are. your intentions were way unneccesary and i dont know why i was there for you in the first place. i thought you were a great person but you have totally proven me wrong and i have&nbsp;<U>zerroo</U> respect for you. </P>
<P>next!=). <EM>you</EM> (guy). well.. i know i already told you this but <U>im sorry</U>. i honestly don't know why i was being bitter and i didnt mean for it to go on for as long as it did. i just want us to go back to how we were. i hope you stick to your word.. waiting for your call. =/ =). <STRONG>&lt;3</STRONG></P>
<P>#3 (guy). heh well.. dont really know where to start on this one. its hard trying to determine whether its you that i like.. or the idea of you that i like. maybe a little of both? i dont know any more, dont think i ever did really. you are by far the most confusing person ive ever met. or i could just be me making you out to be that. either way you confuse me greatly. heh its not ur fault though, you dont even do anything. i dont get it. im okay without you but i feel better with you. i hope im making sense.</P>
<P>haha i just wrote 68 reasons why i like you (i went into detail ha). i make lists when i am bored. what a waste of time but it amuses me for a while. im looking forward to tomorrow and the weekend. =). everything is good. &lt;3kelly</P></FONT>"

<P>so i was reading my last 3 entrys and wow.. i dont think i could get ne grumpier! well i just want to say that i am so glad that i had the chance to see the good side of you. you can be a great person when you want to be and <strong>i promise i wont think of you as anything differently</strong>. i listened to you.. i want you to know that.. im holding on to every word you said. though we were never ne thing you have made one of the hugest impacts on me. ill wait for you to feel the same things that i feel for you. 

so felt like i needed to say that. my weekend has been really good. today brandi was supossed to come over but jeanne is ruining that!=(. tear, miss her dearly. i was gonna go see shannon this morning but i needed to shower n stuff n she had work so blah. i miss her a lot. its weird saying ""aw i talked to shannon tonite!"" like its not a normal everyday thing. i let everything important to me slip away. grand isnt it? =)

so i am 'reflecting' on everything. i dont know how i did it but all the time i was wasteing on you totally made me absent minded as to what was happening to me outside of how i felt about you. dont you just hate when that happens. i sure do. makes me sad actually. i wont show it. i wouldnt flatter yourself. 

<strong>i think i hate online diarys</strong>. i think i hate hurricanes too when i dont have ne thing better to do than to sit and write about pointless things. i think i need to find something to do to keep me busy. you will def. never read this. you mean so much to me. <3kelly </P></FONT>"

"event","<FONT face=""Verdana"" size=1> so my ""good day"" has totally been bombed and shot down about 43958 times now. brittney was supossed to come over but she had surgery..=/.. i really hope shes ok.. kinda scary. didnt expect to hear that wen i called. =/. well ne way so then i was supossed to go to the concert with lexi. parentals werent having it. 

i am really bummed out right about now. everytime i start thinking that your not what i thought you were i just get proved wrong again. i feel dissappointed all over again, n even more heart broken then i was. im not as upset as i was though.. no big deal right. im in the process of forgetting a.k.a acting like it never happened. and since i just love doing this so much maybe ill just 'forget' that i ever learned ur name, much less talked to you. yeah, i think that sounds like a great plan. what do you think? oh thats right, you dont care WHAT SO EVER. my bad i must have forgotten between my crying (its harder to think) and trying to remember what not and what im supossed to forget. since you decide that for me in all. if its not about you then i dont know who its about b/c it sure doesnt seem like its about me. im so mad.. not at you. im not mad at you at all, im just mad that i let myself fall this hard. that i let myself care this much. you didnt do ne thing wrong. your entitled to your oppinion and i completley understand what u were saying. i just didnt like it=(. at all.. but its no big. heh its not like your all that i think about right. its not like for the past month every thing that ive written in here is about you. im crying for no reason. really, i am(sarcasm). your just some random person that isnt to fond of me. and that is why ive written a page about you. any minute now would be the time for me to stop caring. you'll never read this. :'( <3kelly

i really do miss you sumtimes. after all this time i still miss all our memories n how we were so close. no one will ever understand how i felt about you. how strong i felt n how i thot that nothing would come between us n that u wouldnt change n that everything just wouldnt change. naive perhaps? very. n thats my fault. all of this was my fault. im so sorrie. wow i hate thinking about this but gosh. gotta get it out sumtime rite? n my friends arent there for me on that level so ive always been stuck on my own with this thing. its ok tho. ive made it out alrite havnt i? im happier then ive ever been b4. n even tho i could always be happier.. im perfectly fine with the way things are. i love my life so much n its goin really good rite but i just cant stop thinking about it. i just cant. ill push it n the bak of my head for a day, a week maybe but it just comes bak n it haunts me. it haunts me till i just gotta deal with it n try to turn it nto a positive thing. no1 will ever replace you. i have come to that conclusion..i will never be as close with sum1 as i was with you. u dont kno how much u hurt me. i cant trust ne bodie. no1. maybe thats a good thing? if ya dont trust ppl then u dont get hurt n the long run rite? dont get close to ne1. *sigh* wut am i saying. i have so manie mixed feelings about this that its crazy. i just toss my thots around my head n they all contridict themselves. one minute im depressed about it n blaming you for doing this to me n the next im thinking positive saying that u made me to be the best person i can be n changed me n made me more mature n shaped me as a person. gosh, y did it take leaving me to make me see wut i was doing. god.. y couldnt u warn me? y couldnt u make me see? *sigh* regardless of it all. it was my fault. my dumbass self that ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. i will never forget you. i will never forget you. *sigh* i really miss you. im so sorrie. hate me. i deserve it.

<P><FONT color=#33ccff>haha the ""sissy stick"". </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>my dad n his friends&lt;they're friggin crazy&gt; shoot off rockets every weekend n today i went cuz i was bored. me, my sis, n brently (bro's friend) rode n the bak of my dads truck. that was ok.. fun i guess? it was freezing tho. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>there was one girl my age there which i forgot her name n we talked a lil. she was cool n im so bored so i wish i woulda rode n the car with them but ne way. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>so then we launched off all these rockets which was cool i guess. haha it was so weird cuz this big ol' van came up n it said ""yada yada school of boys"" haha so like they stop to where we are n the guy is like ""do u mind if we watch?"". there was only like 5 guys n they looked like 17. one was really cute ha but i think they mite have been like excel or sumthin. ha i have no clue but yea so they watched us shoot off the rockets. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>it was funni watchin all the lil kids chasin after the rockets. austen's so cute (kid i babysit) how he runs n gets the rockets. ha that kid is a lil demon tho. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>at the end they had like this 4 foot long rocket called the ""sissy stick"".. it was so funni.. it didnt go very far.. n it landed n a bush that was like 20 ft away. ha it was cool.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>then it was even colder outside n tammy offered to give me n taryn a ride but taryn wanted to ride n the truck n i didnt wanna leave her with brently so i juss decided to ride with her. ugh. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>o well. n then i came home really tired for sum reason n juss watched tv.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>today has been a really boring day n i havnt gotten ne of my h/w done. shit. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>ugh. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>i feel so bad. cuz my uncle invited me to go to church tomorow n i said i would but i have <STRONG>nothing</STRONG> to wear. all my skirts are way to short n i dont own a dress. fuck. ugh. so then i didnt wanna call him n tell him i cant go cuz i felt bad. n like me n my uncle <STRONG>never </STRONG>talk so i think it would be weird goin places with him. ill go cuz the church sounds cool or w/e. but i think i wanna bring a friend or sumthin cuz geez. i make friends easily but i would feel <STRONG>really</STRONG>&nbsp; uncomfortable y'kno?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>so then im like dad will u please call him cuz i feel bad for cancleing. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>n my dad is such an ass. holy shit. so then my dad calls n is like yea she feels bad.. yada yada n then hes like ""yea, i told her to call u. she needs to grow up""&nbsp; wtf?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>i woulda called him n told him if i friggin knew the guy. i talk my uncle every friggin once n a while. ugh. but w/e. so im not going. which is good cuz it would have been weird. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>ill juss go sum other time wen i ahve a friend. cuz i mean it sounded really cool cuz they have a band n like this ""cafe"" w/ a stage n yada yada. so yea i do wanna go.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>i juss need to like get clothes n find sumbodie that wants to go. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>n i feel so bad bcuz i should <STRONG>want</STRONG>&nbsp; to go no matter the circumstances.. i feel like im betraying god or sumthing. i havent been to church n so long.. i dont even really feel like a christian ne more. n that upsets me cuz i wanna believe n everything but gosh. i wish that knowing ppl at the church wasnt that important to me n that i would juss go juss bcuz its the right thing to do. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>wow. im blowing this <STRONG>way</STRONG> out of proportion but o well.. im SO bored n tired n im n &nbsp;the ""lets think about things till i get a mygrain n pass out""&nbsp; kinda mood. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>i went over to jackies earlyer but she was doin the dishes. damn her parents are cranky. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>i wish i was at school. ha thats pathetic but i really wish i was. that place is so much fun. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>on monday raven was saying that me, kim, n britt were gonna go over there but i duno ne more. kim n raven are mad at britt (as always) but chances are raven il be like ""im mad at her, but im still gonna talk to her"" so w/e. dun really matter i guess. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>ne way. im gonna call this person ""taylor"" so it could be a girl or boy. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff>me n taylor dun really talk much ne more n its so weird to me cuz we used to be really good friends. n i mean yea we drifted a part but we still talked about things every once n a while n he/she would open up to me n tell me how they were feelin. its so different now n its like he/she's a completley different person now then to who i used to kno so well. n yea i kno ive changed <STRONG>so</STRONG> much but that shouldnt have changed our friendship.. cuz i honestly think that ive changed for the best. i realized a lot of things about myself from last year n ive changed. but taylor has juss turned nto this constantly angry, constantly upset kinda person. we had so manie inside jokes n taylor could always make me laugh. its crazy how sum1 can change so much n still appear to be that same person. i just wish for one day that things were like they were.. just to feel wut it felt like then. we got n a whole lot of fights n i was so immature about it. i would start fights for the stupidest shit. it was insane. we made it thru it tho still being friends which was a good thing. taylor used to mean a whole lot to me n she/he made a <STRONG>huge</STRONG> impact on my life but i guess things just&nbsp; change. ppl change... n u gotta just deal with it n hope for the best.. :-). </FONT></P>

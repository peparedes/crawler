And it's leveled to the ground as well. I didn't plan for it, but it is at it should be. As he tried to make it be. It seemed right at the time, and I don't regret it in retrospect, even if it wasn't something I thought through.

Hello.

Skye and Cori have informed me they want to take down a barrier, and well. If you feel like I have prohibited you from taking initiative, please don't. The faster all the barriers fall, the faster the city does, and the end of the year is nearing, as well.

Other cities have taken it upon themselves to take down more than one barrier at once, and, well, in the unlikely circumstance that the Hung Shing Temple should not fall, hitting them again soon after wouldn't be expected from us, at least not yet.

The Hong Kong Observatory has been standing long enough, I think.

Please let me know if you intend on joining or not, and I'll enclose a date later on."

It's been a while since anything was taken down in this city. And, well. Kowloon Walled City Park has been standing long enough. There are more than enough parts of the park to go around, and I still have some explosives left from the prison.

We won't do this until after you return to Hong Kong, Angeline, since it was your suggestion. Which makes me shoot for the coming Monday.

At first, I wanted to make a well-informed, contemplated decision. Regardless of how I <i>felt</i>, it should have been weighed and thought about considerably more than I ever did. Perhaps I didn't try hard enough, or perhaps I wanted it to be based on emotion.

If that was the case though, why did I insist on fooling myself into thinking it wasn't?

That's four for Seal and three for Angel. But we have counterparts, because fate likes to even things out. Why was there even a need for me to choose, then? My role isn't more powerful than his, the only difference is he had no choice in the matter. I chose for him. I chose for everyone in this city. If I was one of seven who could change the future, then why does he exist?

Fourteen instead of seven makes a world of difference, but if I was meant to make this choice all along, does that mean the final battle is set as well? I couldn't have been a Seal, not in my lifetime.

But if that's the case, fate is just playing with all of us.

I'll play my part.

At least I can get to choose that much."

That Jenna person who replied is also an Angel, it appears. That's five for them and three for the Seals. I'm not sure what to think of their reasoning. Alex... he's detached. Jenna seemed more apathetic, and Lucky... well. She's judging the entire human race for something her parents did. I would not claim parents do not have the most influence over their children, but it does raise a question.

Do <i>I</i> have the right to decide the world is to end based on <i>my</i> personal experiences? Fate seems to think so. There are six others as well, yet only five of them seem to be acknowledging it. If that is the case, though, Mother and Father might have been acting through their selfish desires, but in the process, they didn't hurt the human race as a whole.

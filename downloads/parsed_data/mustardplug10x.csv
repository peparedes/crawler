"event","So I bought 2 cds today!!! 
The Funeral of God by ZAO 
Ferret Music 2004:Progression Through Agression  

The Funeral of God is by far one of the best metal cds I've ever heard since Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child by Norma Jean and Hot Damn! by Every Time I Die. And they're still all christians. Every thank you in the back of the booklet was a thank you to god and I was so happy. The cd itself is incredible. I'm completely blown away by it and I hope they make their way over here during tour. 

The Compilation is incredibly awesome too! 

While at the register of the cd store, the guy at the counter gave my hat a glance and said: 
""Do you really listen to Mustard Plug?"" 

I told him that I did and that they were awesome and that I saw them at the Ska is Dead Tour. He said: 

""Don't not listen to Mustard Plug, nobody listens to ska anymore."" 

lol I thought that was funny because I've started to think the same thing. 

Anyway, today was a sucess. 
More later/tommorow."

"event","I haven't updated in a while (in my terms) so.... 

Today I'm hoping to go to the Greendale Mall and get the new ZAO cd. I think it's going to be an incredible cd, no matter what the hype is. 

I need to practice saxophone and bass some, maybe I'll do it today. It was cool because at my last practice my teacher said I <i>would</i> make Jazz Band. The only problem is that usually I have him help me with a song if I can't listen to it, and I won't be able to go to lessons during the weeks when I'd be first joining jazz band. 

Next week is DMA, ugh, I don't really want to go. 

I'm starting to realize how lazy I am. I mostly sit around all day which is really bad. 

Basically I have to wait until 6 to go to the mall and I'm not really happy about that because I know in my mind that when I get there the cd will be sold out in both stores. It's such a pain. I'd call and this is what they'd say: 
We have a copy. 


1 COPY!!!!! 

Ack, more later."

"event","So far.... I'm going to my alto sectional which is good because I won't be home next week because of DMA. 

I think I'm sick, I have a soar throat, cough, and sneezing. Maybe I just need an allergy pill (hopefully) because I don't want to be sick before I go to DMA. I don't want to be sick for my sectional either but that I might not be able to help.
 
As you can see, I have a new format. Every so often I think you might see it change because I'm going to be using an Every Time I Die picture too. But basically I like this format a lot. 

Tommorow the new ZAO cd comes out and I'm WICKED excited. 

I really hope Keith doesn't try to swing by on Wednesday because chances are he'd come when I wasn't in. 

So anyway I officially have 100 dollars saved for merch money for the concerts. It's funny because I got my allowence on Sunday and then my mom gave me anothe 20 dollars for spending money for the fireworks, but we didn't spend it haha so that's how it got bumped up to 100 dollars. 

I thought about ordering Ethans today...haha 

I've decided not to let cruddy commenters get to me (thanx jess haha). So it's public again."

So I've been listening to my Big D cd a lot which is fun. 

So I loaded some stuff from PureVolume today: 
ZAO put 2 more of their tracks from their new cd online!!!!!! FREAKN AWESOME! 
I loaded some stuff by the Stray Bullets too. They're cool. 

Sixfinger is putting a track online soon. Ya'll should check that out. 

I'm hoping they make new ZAO clothes through Ferret. 

Anyway I saw Amanda. 
She was so beautiful. She had a new haircut and everything. 
I want to pick her up and kiss her right there lol unfortanetly all I got in was a hello but she looked so happy, and I know that I was on cloud 9..............hundred. 

I think that's enough said.

Also Steve's brother has made an offer with me which I'm super excited about and that is that for each good band I get to go to his studio he'll give me 1 hour of free recording time. !!!!!! Does anybody want to start a band, I'll play bass, you guys do the rest lol.

So tommorow Sixfinger goes into the studio. I wish I could have been there to see them do some recording. Oh well............ 

I think I'm just going to preorder the Flaming Tsunami cd cuz it looks like I'm not going to the cd release after all. *sigh*

"event","There's 1 things I hate more than anything right now: 

Missing Warped Tour because of band camp. 

Knowing that I'm missing a show I've wanted to go for over 2 years makes my teeth grind and makes me want to throw something out my window. 

I hate band, why must I miss Warped Tour for something I hate. 

And all of my favorite bands will be there! The Planet Smashers, Monty's Fan Club, Big D and the Kids Table, underOATH. Dammit, if I think about it another second longer I'm going to quit band. 

I mean what makes me more mad about missing Warped Tour for band camp is that nobody in band appreciates me there and I'm sure if I quit Mrs. Snow would be overjoyed. 

I swear if I don't see Amanda at the Woodstock Fair, I will have completely given up on my luck. 

But chin up Josh! 

So Friday I'm going to a wrastling show for good ol times with my dad and well I asked Bryan but he probbably can't go, which won't fail to excede my hopes. But what else?!?! 

July 16th is the release date of the Funeral of God by ZAO. That's right, something to look forward to.

I should probbably start listening to more of the Used if I'm going to a show to see them. But Funeral for a Friend is going to be there and I'm WICKED excited about that. And I like Linkin Park's live sound. So that's not to bad. 

And I'm going to the Between the Buried and Me show with Keith the next day. And I LOVE Between the Buried and Me, Glass Casket, and Beloved to no end. And I've been wanting to see Beloved for a LONG time. 

Damon hasn't gotten back to me on the Flaming Tsunami show, so I imagine I'm not going. So w/e, ya kno. 

I got Sixfinger to consider recording at Wicked Smart Studios, and they're going in at noon which means they'll probbably try to schedule some dates down here. 
THAT IS AWESOME! 

Anyway, that's all."

I'm starting with Drowning Pool's Sinner which I got a long time ago. 
Then on to System of a Down's Toxicity. 
Followed by Papa Roach's Infest. 
Then Incubus's Make Yourself 
Then Black Label Society's Alcohol Fueled Brewtality. 

Then I need to get a new stack. I like this cd I'm listening to, this is the best idea I've ever had. Once I've listened to all of them I'm going put my cd's back in boxes.

So anyway, I think im turning into a Metal Head because I listened to Between the Buried and Me again and REALLY liked it. Which is weird for me. 

Youth Group on wednesday is Guys Night Out. Should be fun.

I had a dream about visiting someone. It was weird because everything I looked at until I went to bed was in it. A girl (not Amanda) and Mario the first video game. So weird. 

The fireworks aren't until next Sunday Mal thanks to the rain. Sorry. 

I haven't talked to Damon about the show we're supposed to go to. So I guess we're not going.

I can't believe I lost her...........She was like the best thing that ever happened to me. The last time I saw her was the Woodstock Fair......I guess we never sent each other Christmas Cards huh girl? Your picutre is over my lightswitch so I will never dream a night without you. 

For this one second I'm going to shut off my yelling music to listen to the one song that I feel was written for her and me. 
 
if anyone ever writes another song about you
if anyone ever sings another melody with your name in it...
just remember this:
1) did it best
2) and meant it the most

Those days we ran from class and went up to your room.
Thursday night at 9
we found the closest park,
this means so much to me
""how much does this mean to me?""

when the lights have all dimmed and no one seemed to stay

i saw you in the dark

and i said to you like i said once before.....x2

""my feelings are on the floor, 
they are there for you to keep
to hold, 
and to embrace them all""

so lets lock all the doors and cement the windows shut
no one will get in to...
""ruin our wonderful night""
if you just look up through the cracks in the ceiling,
where the water drips down
you could see-
they let the moonlight in just enough to see your face and thats all i need  

To Amanda, The One Girl Who Will Always Be In My Heart

"event","I'm not happy right now. 

Usually I come online or I'll be online for a while and either Laurie will already be here or she'll eventually come on. But I haven't talked to her in a while. When I don't talk to someone, I'm always afraid that they're mad at me for some reason, but I don't think that she is (I hope). Because one day she signed off then signed on really quickly. Maybe it was Natalie or a family member. 

That playlist was short lived. 

I have too many cds. I need to sit down one day and just listen to every single one of them. It's so bad though, because they're everywhere!!!!!!!!! It makes me feel like I want to know exactly where each of them is but in some ways it doesn't matter. I'm going to be so horrible when I go to college. 

So I watched the Bunker with my dad. It was about the dumbest, pointless, confusing movie I've ever seen. 

You know what I've noticed? That if you copy and paste something, you won't remember what it is, because we don't really think about it. 

I'm wicked random right now. 

I shouldn't have taken all my cds out of boxes to put them in that case, it's making me freak out. 

I have a sax sectional tommorow, I haven't looked at the music. I need to learn it! Because in retrospect I don't have much more time before band camp. But I have saxophone. Like officially. I mean, I love bass. I'm not the best at it and I probbably never will be. But I feel like I'm at the point of end for sax, I've gotten as good as I think I can get. 

Maybe I'll practice sax on Tuesday or something. 

Nothing's really happening today, and I'm freaking bored!

"event","While I was the mall and my mom was buying a watch I came to the hugest realization of my life, and byfar the best and one pepole have been trying to put upon me for a long time now. 

I've lived thinking you have to have good looks to get a girl, no matter how nice or funny you are. But I've been so wrong. 
You could be what people consider ugly but as long as you were nice and funny and all those good characteristics, you could be with anyone in the world, and if they turn you down on your looks that's their loss, because so many people are getting married for the wrong reasons these days. And I also realized just because I go out and see girls who seem nice and funny doesn't mean that I will always have a chance with every girl in the world because we don't just do that, we look for 1 right person at a time until you find the perfect one for you, and I full-heartedly now believe that I have a 100 percent chance in life as long as I lighten my attitude, lower my defenses, and try to be more open and funny. And I can't do that expecting to get a beauty, and that itself shouldn't matter. 

I guess that's a good way to look at life. 
Don't you think? 

People are just so damn judgemental sometimes, but that's not my fault, if someone can't hang out with me because I'm not as funny as everyone else or even as good looking than I think they should have a serious life change, because I'm not going to all of a sudden go out and change just so I can be with that person. If I'm going to change me, I'm going to change me <i>for</i> me, and nobody else. 

That's all, comment."

"event","So I bought the <i>Between the Buried and Me</i> cd yesterday and quite honestly it's good but the singer's screaming is quite annoying. Yes I know, this coming from me. It's a pain though. Like it sounds like he's forcing his voice to sound that rediculously bad. But otherwise the cd is good. Haha the singer looks like the head honcho of the Beastie Boys. Oh well, maybe they'll sound good live. <i> I hope</i> It sounds way to much like Dracula influenced metal. <b>Do you get what I'm saying?</b> 

So anyway, today are my cousin's birthdays, one celebrated and one's actual birthday. I can't imagine having children who's birthdays are so far apart, although, I'm an only child so that's not tottaly unbelivable right? 

So I got information about UMASS Lowell, and it sounds awesome, not to mention they go to Boston alot which sounds really cool, since I love Boston. Haha it's also funny that when I get there that Josh would be a senior there and I'd be a Freshman, just like this year. 

I was up late yesterday to the point where I couldn't see straight anymore, weird huh?

"event","When I read this article in Alternative Press today, I lost all attitude on the release of the Funeral of God by ZAO. Please read this. I would if it was in your journal. This band is an important part of my life so please read up.



AP Magazine: Are you expecting a knee-jerk reaction from some fans because of the new disc's title? 

Scott Mellinger: Definitely. The reaction I'm hoping for is that people might be a little shocked, but they'll be open-minded enough to read the lyrics and try to get into what they mean. I'm kind of concerned that the reaction we're going to get is ""Oh, my gosh, they're going against what they've been before; I can't listen to them."" 

Ap: The Funeral of God is a concept record. What's the main idea behind it? 

Mellinger: I think the concept of the record bases itself around if God decided - (based on)the way humans react to Him and how people react to the situation of the world-to let Himself die and not be a part of it anymore. What would happen and what the reaction of people Christian or not Christian be, losing their God or knowing that there was a God and they lost him? 

Dan Weyandt: Humanity has turned its back (on God). Imagine culture today and everything that is going on. There's no need in a lot of people's minds for a God anymore. He doesn't die from old age; He isn't killed; He makes his own decision to let Himself fall out of the picture. Some of the songs talk about the main attitudes of people these days and how many people are walking around saying, ""I wish I was dead."" It (started with) a weird dream I had right before we started writing. 

AP: What was the dream? 

Weyandt: The beinning had happened, and God was gone. The feeling was almost anarchy. I can go stab this guy and I won't be going to Hell, because that's all part of the past. It was one of the dreams where you wake up and for a second you're not sure you're dreaming. 

AP: It seems coincidental that at the same time ZAO switched from the Christian label Solid State to Ferret, Jesse Smith departed. 

Mellinger: Jesse leaving had nothing to do with going to Ferret. When Jesse left, Ferret was the reason we kept going. Carl (Severson, Ferret owner) has such a heart for this. Our contract was up with Solid State, and when we decided to this again, Carl was on of the first guys we called.  

AP:..... Speaking of, what's the fire that keeps ZAO going after so many breakups and reconstructions? 

Mellinger: When the first band came out, there was such a fire for the ministry part of what they were doing. (But) as time went on, all those guys lost their fire for being in a band (and) being on tour. When Jesse got Dan and Russ and Brett in the band, there was a fire to make music. Now, this new revitalization, Dan and Russ and I have always loved doing this. It's been a part of our lives for so long that having the two new members is giving us our fire. We're so excited to have everyone in the band creatively working together. There's a passion that hasn't been in the band for three or four years."

hey josh 
yes sometime we do hire. 
you should check out MPE courses at BERKLEY or HART etc...
check back when you follow thru. 
cheers.ZING... 



AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All of my favorite bands record in that studio, and I would absoluetly love working there. It's so awesome that they emailed me back, because this is what I've decided to do with my life. 

I've decided to do livejournal all the time only because I figure that it's better to have a livejournal because my friends from xanga can still comment on here and read up on my day if they want to, and so can all the friends who didn't use xanga and used livejournal. 

Today sucked big time. 
Here it is in Mal style: 
Today Josh.... 
-Fell asleep at 1:30 A.M. to work today 
-Woke up at 3:30 A.M. because of thunder storm 
-Started to fall asleep at 4:00 A.M. 
-Got up at 6 A.M. to work 
-Found out I wasn't just weedwacking, found out I was weeding hedges, filling holes, and carrying wood to the barn. 
-Was filling the wheel bare-oh with dirt and the wheel bare-oh fell over and spilled dirt all over the wet grass. 
-Finished filling holes and carrying wood to the barn and the weedwacker didn't work. 
-Was told to fill holes that were huge and a long ways away from the dirt. 
-Had a water bottle and talked to little cousins Ryan and Alyssa. Promised Ryan and Alyssa I'd take them to 6 Flags one day when I can drive. 
-Had to weed (least favorite thing ever) 
-Had his grandma out there making him use the hedge cutter which he had no clue how to use. 
-Got yelled at for using the hedge cutter and listening to my grandma. 
-Had to hand weed with a long sleeve shirt on in the scorching heat. 
-Got a huge freakn headache. 
-Almost threw up. 
-Was told by grandma not to listen to Mrs.Colbush and to go ahead and cut the hedges. 
-Got yelled at again for using the hedge cutter. 
-Unplugged the hedge cutter and brought it back which made Grandma made because she wanted scissors, not her grandson putting the hedge cutter away. 
-Walked away and let his mom talk to her when she got there.
-Had a killer headache and was hungry. 
-Ate. 
-Was brought back to life. 
-Had a fun car ride home with my mom. 
-Is going to buy tickets for the Beloved show. 
-Is done writing like Mallory, lol. 

So today was ok. LoL it sounds crappy, but it was ok. 

Um that's all for now. 
Bye."

"event","Did nothing today. Went to the gay haunted house to do nothing but stand around and look at girls walking by with my friend. I was pretty fuckin plastered at least. That made the place somewhat barable. This one girl I was supposed to hang out with got bored of me and decided to chill with another one of her guy friends. Oh well, I cant win em all I guess. At least, like I said, I was drunk. I'm not realy in a good mood. I can realy tell from the fact that I'm coming on this journal thingy to complain. I need to quit something that has gotten out of hand recently. I take a look at myself and I feel pathetic that it has gotten this bad."

So I met up with my friends and got loaded, played pool, and just chilled. I think I have insomnia. I've had only a total of 6 hours of sleep in the last three days. That is some wierd shit. Well, I'm thinking about going to pass out soon... PEACE"

"event","Reality blows. And that is it. Had another great day (seriously sarcasticly toned). I could complain. But, I'd rather say this, ""The day I sell my guitar is the day that I will no longer be happy."" The only thing that has kept me sane is my music. But, I think I am starting to lose it. Shit is just gettin to me more than it used to. I'm not as tolerant and people I used to get along well with now piss me the fuck off. So what happens now? I think I'll have a drink...

"event","So yea, I had the fucking worst day. And of course everytime that that happens I come to complain on this crap. Welll, anyways, I woke up at the crack of 3 pm right? And all the sudden I got shit to do and no fucking time to do it. My dad's being a dick but my moms bein cool, but my sis is in total bitch mode and I'm in the middle of all this crap. So, I end up goin to the liquor store (the people who know me all know where this is going), and I got ciggarettes and smoked a whole shitload of 'em. Then I went down to the Canoga liquor store (once again you all know where this is going) and I went to buy some medicine for my headache. So, I tried to buy some beer... But the guy who is usually cool with me tells me his stores under servailence (if that is how you fucking spell it, I dont know). So, I'm like, ""Fucking great!"" I cant buy beer and I have no pot. So, what does my desperate ass do? I call up my ex-girlfriends sister and ask her for bud. Dont get me wrong, she's cool and all, but she lags on people sometime (the good part of the story is coming up). This girl who I kinda sorta maybe (just saying this because I'm drunk) like acts like she doesn't even know me when I call her up. Why, do you ask? Because she is at her little piece of fucking shit boyfriend's house (I'll beat the crap out of him once he turns 18) and she knows that I hate him so she acted like a little fucking hoe tease or whatever and acts like she doesn't even know me. Fuck that bitch! Y'know what? I dont give a flying fuck anymore! I dont care about this relationship bullshit because I dont fucking need one! All I need is a nice girl to just fuck (not trying to be an asshole) and that's the end of it. That's it. That is all I fucking ask for. I dont want none of that lying bullshit, no cheating bullshit, no emotional baggage bullshit, or no bitching bullshit. But y'know, I should calm down and think for a minute. I haven't met all the women out there. This is just a pissed off drunken, stoned response to the ones I know that have pissed me off. So... Until I meet a good one I will be miserable with all the bad ones (maybe that's why I drink in the mornings). Peace people, or whoever the fuck reads this bullshit!

p.s. My ex's sis came through and I eventually got drunk and stoned and went and played pool with my friend. So, whatever............"

"event","Hell yes!! I am out of this fucking god forsaken valley for a whole fucking week!!! My friend Josh invited me camping up at the lake by San Luis Abisbo or however the fuck you spell that shit. Theres gonna be beer and bitches and no fucking high school drama. I think I've made some good friends in the past week. Some of them are borderline insane but that is what makes them cool people. I can honestly say I will have nothing to worry about if I have a problem with someone. I do them favors and they do me favors. That's how it works. Kinda like a mafia crime family. But back to the main subject. I'm out of this fucking hell hole!!! No more stupid people, no more fake people, no more liers, and no more damn tweakers. Although I have learned not all tweakers have let tweak get to them. There are some that have stronger minds such as myself and do not let it overtake their lives. I feel stronger now, almost invincible, but not quite. Well, I'm leaving tomorrow morning and I will be spending the next couple days being drunk, stoned, riding jet skies, wake-boarding, and getting laid. So long for now losers!"

"event","Today started out as usual. Got up at the crack of noon, or rather a couple hours past the crack of noon, ate, played guitar, took shower, decided not to shave, and went out to buy cigarettes. I ended up going to my friends house and we played xbox and shit and went out to play some pool. I made up with one of my old friends from Canoga today. It kinda felt good. She was a bitch but I was also an asshole, but I guess that's just how people get sometime. I really wish I could still be friends with some other people I used to get along really well with but shit happens. I did some bad shit last night, I really wont even mention it I just saw an opportunity and it came up so it happened. Whatever, it is not the end of the world. At least, I'm trying to get more healthy and pushing weights more. That is good for my self-confidence, I guess. Well it's time for my last cigarette of the day. I will always remember the wise words of a man I once knew: ""Shit doesn't start until you go out looking for it.""

"event","I'm back to bitch and complain on this bullshit online journal. This is the most boring summer I have ever fucking had. My days consist of me getting drunk or stoned at home and smoking ciggs out in front of my house, I guess, at some lame attempt to wait for something exciting to happen. My friends are all occupied with their own thing so I pretty much have no one to hang out with. Ones got a job while the others got a girl it is all the same old story. I'm starting to play guitar more which is good, I guess. I have recently written a couple of new songs but, unfortunately, I have no band to play them with. I got really drunk at a cobalt show last night where the Scuffs, RFD, 10 Seconds, and Government Cheese was playing and it was pretty cool. Although I cant remember how I got home or how I got drunk but I do remember meeting this cute girl there in the back alley while sippin on some Old English. I dont remember her name though and I apparently didnt get her number. Oh well, it's not like I'm looking for a relationship right now. 

""You want to get me a girlfriend? Why dont we just blow my brains out now and save yourself some time."" -Me

"event","What the fuck? Am I going insane? Anyways, I feel like a dumbass. I did the stupidest thing in the world today. I'm not even gonna take the time to write about it, it is so stupid. All I will say about it is that I think I have killed too many braincells. Oh well, retarded people look happy enough. Oh my god I'm so suprised; she stopped talking to me. I never saw that shit coming (heavy sarcastic tone). But its okay. They do it all the fucking time. I'll just get another one but she'll probably end up getting bored of me too. I have found the secret to happiness, though. It is quite easy. All you have to do is find a comfortable place to sit, take a bottle of Jack Daniels and a generously packed bong and just sit back and laugh at all the fucked up things in life. Life is a bitch and then you die. That's the way it goes. I'm outta here, this is starting to sound redundant...

I'd like to tell you folks, or whoever the hell reads this shit, the whole story and everything that has happened but I dont think that there's enough room for it. Oh well, fuck it. I'm losing friends very fast for some reason. I stopped talking to most of them because all the drama that has been happening just got to be too much for me to handle without blowing a fucking valve. I have two words to describe all of those fuckers who just hang out and talk shit all the time: gossip-whores. That's it. That is all that they are. And you know what? Fuck them. Fuck them and their fucked up mentality. And you know what pisses me off? People who lie really piss me the fuck off. Like, say you leave a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey in your friends car. He says he will be right back. Four hours later you cant get a hold of him. For the next couple days you dont see him but he calls you and tells you he still has your bottle. A day later you find out he drank the bottle the day you left it in his car. Is it just me or is that a real bitch move for a friend to make? Oh well, I think I'm better off not talking to any of those people anymore. I met this new girl. She is kind of young and I can tell that she has been in a lot more relationships than I have even been rejected. She is really fuckin pretty though and I feel like she is kinda out of my league. Oh well, I think she is bored of me already anyways. I have to admit shes a better kisser than any of the girls I have kissed. She is such a tease, though. She just sits there flicking her toungue ring at me and winking and shit. AAAHHHHH I just wanna rip all her clothes off and... Sorry got a little carried away there. Anyway, I have heard a lot of crazy shit over the past couple days that I wont even mention it is so bad. Oh yea, I got stopped by the police in front of school last friday. Someone supposidly called in and said that I had a gun but I didn't have one thing on me at all. It was kind of fun hearing a cop apologize and kiss my ass after taking me to the ground for no reason at all. I dont even carry a gun (on me). I'm just kidding folks I'm not a violent person. I'd rather knock the teeth outta some bitch I dont like rather than shooting them in the face. It is just more satisfying that way, and less illegal. Well, take care folks I'm at the end of my thoughts for today.

Have you ever thought you were doing something good for someone, helping them out, and then you find out you just made things worse? It sucks doesn't it. I should shut my fat mouth. You know what's fun? Drowning your sorrows in a bottle is fun. It's temporary but it's all good. Happiness is becoming a want rather than a need which is great because I guess that shows how desensitized to all the bullshit and drama out there which is exactly what I want. I've always been told by many people that I am a really sweet and nice guy. Lately I've been growing bitter though. I'm starting to enjoy being an asshole.

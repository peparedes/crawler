"event","<lj-cut text=""The first lesson."">Moving as though already resigned to her fate, Kyrie steps over to the wall, leaning forward onto her palms and spreading her legs. Her head is bowed, shorn scalp gleaming faintly in the small amount of light allowed into the cell. Every movement, every gesture, seems to speak of failure, of loss. Only those who know her well, who know well what to look for would recognize the way her muscles tense and tighten in back and thigh, arms and shoulders. She takes on the posture of the broken, but her body remains primed to fight.

Those who enter the cell do so quickly, fanning away from the door so that three men can be seen, perched there, weapons trained on the thin, small girl as though she were some hellbeast. They move with an almost clockwork precision, reaching to manhandle her into position so that her wrists and ankles can again be slipknotted together. The men aren't wearing tags, belts, glasses or watches -- all pins, pens, weapons or anything that could be made /into/ a weapon has been removed from their person, and it looks like they're wearing protective clothing, like one might if they were going to handle extremely violent dogs. Only the men outside of the chamber have guns, and those are well out of her reach, as well as targeted to her head, heart and lower spine through the back. ""Don't struggle,"" one of those at her ankles says softly. ""You'll find this place a lot easier to deal with if you just go along,"" he advises, his voice icy and firm.

Now where has she heard that before? At the moment, there are only two thoughts going through Kyrie's head. One: If they really wanted her dead, she'd already be that way. They're keeping her alive because that's how they want her. At least, for the moment. And Two: Dead might just be better. She remains in her posture until the men fall into place. Damn. No toys for weapons. Too bad.. but at least she doesn't -need- toys. As soon as they're near enough to her for her to reach, she's moving, spinning away from the wall as quickly as drug-laced muscles can move. The fingers of both hands fold down to the palms as she swings out, trying to hit whatever she can.

There's a snarl of fury and irritation -- one of the men lashes out; he's all muscle and corded strength, movement. Speed and agility. He's no real match for a mutant, but his strength well above average. He'll pound Kyrie if he can manage it, blocking her movements, attempting to get a hold on her, or beat her down. The men at the door don't scramble, don't tighten their trigger fingers. No one seems all that surprised -- they work toward restraining her, mechanistic and carefully planned. Don't you see the futility, Kyrie? Don't you see that you can't escape this time? And now that you're on /their/ homeland... you can barely hope to hurt them. Are those the kind of questions she asks herself? Maybe. Her blows land, and one or two pain the receivers greatly, but they give nearly as good as they get, fierce and determined. You're ours, and you're going nowhere unless we take you there.

Against one man or two, she'd have them beaten. Against three she'd at least have a chance. These men, however, have studied her long enough to know.. against a crowd of well-trained, strong men.. she has no chance. None. Oh, she lands her blows. Kyrie is good enough that she'll leave a few of them bleeding and broken. It won't save her in the end, will do nothing but fuel her captors anger at her. And yet.. even knowing this, she fights with everything she has. Her teeth, her nails, feet and hands, knees.. hurting them with a quiet desperation. If I must go down, let it be with their blood on my hands. Let it not be alone.

Fighting, fighting, hurting, maiming, /anything/. She can struggle away and punch and push and pull and let out all her violence, but these men are determined. And some are almost laughing. They close in around her push her to the ground and eventually, she'll find herself bound by the cording again, hand to foot, hand to foot. And then they'll carry her between them, guns still trained on her restrained form. Out the door, down the hall. Footsteps clack on tiled floors -- the compound's bigger. Better.

Kyrie notes the changes as they carry her out, her form going limp in their hands. Even that is an act of agression, if a passive one. Make them feel her weight. Make them struggle with it. Make nothing easy for them. Fuck them. She lifts her face, burning everything new into her brain, remembering it all. They've changed, yes. Come up in the world. Hope that makes their fall that much more painful.

Away and away and to a new room, where Kyrie's summariliy all but tossed in, at the feet of a man who's currently having dinner. The smell of food is thick in the air, venison and potatoes, corn, fresh bread, beer. He looks down and smirks at her, as she's just barely out of reach of the table, and him being able to kick at her. She's left there; the other men leave while the one having dinner continues, and says nothing.

Tied up, there is little that Kyrie can do besides lay on the floor, the smell of food thick in the air, taunting her and her poor, empty stomach. Suddenly the hunger is back, full-force, gnawing at her guts, filling her mouth with saliva. She swallows convulsively, her body tensing desperately with need, nostils flaring and fingers curling and uncurling.

""You look uncomfortable,"" the man says, eating a bit crudely, chewing loudly, smacking his lips, evidently enjoying his food with much gusto. He slurps his beer, sucks on a bit of bone and eats the marrow, contemplating pulling another piece from the platter that rests in front of him. He seems mild and uncaring, watching her with idle curiosity.

It's the casualness that really crawls under her skin. Damn it, she's not this unimportant -thing-, to be treated like this. She's -Kyrie-. The best they ever trained. The one they threw away. And she's hungry. God.. she's so hungry she could cry. Squirming on the floor, she manages to turn enough that she can look up at him, watching every movement of his lips, the gleam of fat on his chin. She can nearly taste the food, its smell is so thick around her.. and despite her efforts to keep quiet, her stomach growls audibly.

""Oh you're /hungry/,"" he says, sounding mock-astonished. ""I wonder if there's anything around fit to feed you,"" he says, his expression so mild as he slides another fat slice of venison to his plate. He's a massive man, muscled and tanned, looking well-built and predatory, and no doubt could finish the meal himself if he really wanted to. Perhaps that's his plan, to simply drive Kyrie crazy with her own body's desires. Could it happen?

She swallows her own drool, again and again, throat almost convulsing in its desire for food. Could she go crazy with this sort of desire? It's hard to tell. As hungry as she's been in the past, she's never been -this- hungry, or never had it turned against her in this manner. Licking her lips, she looks up at him, her gaze measuring. ""Gonna drug me again?"" She whispers hoarsely. ""Give me somethin' to eat, watch it knock me out before I've had my fill?""

""Tempting,"" he says. He takes another large bite, then chews and swallows, sighing happily. ""Then again, if you're polite, you may just get something to eat that's perfectly fine and untreated,"" he tells her, gesturing with a bite of venison on a fork. Cruel. Dark eyes watch Kyrie, half-unimpressed, half-amused.

""Good how?"" Kyrie asks, trying to affect a tone of disinterest. ""You want me to teach your boys for you? Maybe ya got somebody you'd like wiped out? Hell.. this is a lot of trouble to go to to get a contract. Just point me at them. Half the cash now, half when they're dead."" She smirks up at him, trying to ignore the twisting in her stomach, wishing it would quit growling, just for a moment. Difficult to sound tough and unmoved when your stomach is rumbling continuously.

""Polite,"" the man says softly, correcting her. ""Polite, Kyrie. Like... /asking/. Like... saying /please/,"" he says, smiling acidly. He eats a little more, all but ignoring her and her growling stomach, there on the hard floor. Still eating loudly, obviously enjoying his food. He wipes his mouth with a napkin and cracks open another beer, then ladles more potatoes onto his plate. The scent of the food is still there, thick and drawn up again each time he stirs up the steam from the hot dishes.

She's not going to do it. She's not going to plead with this pig. She can't. But.. if she doesn't eat, she'll get weak. Too weak to fight them. That would be stupid, and sloppy. Biting her lip, she swallows bile and saliva. The word hurts, even saying it, knowing it's the right thing, it hurt. ""Please.."" It's whispered, barely a breath of air. Swallowing, she tries again. ""Please. Can I have somethin' to eat?""

""What would you like?"" he wonders, getting up and moving to where he can lift her, and set her down in a chair across the table. There are neither dishes nor silverware within her reach, nor is there a tablcloth to pull. ""And would you prefer to eat like an animal, or shall I feed you? I'm not about to untie you an inch,"" he lets her know, quiet but firm.

Kyrie's lips pinch together, her eyes narrowing as she stares at him. Nostrils flare with each breath, aching in her lungs. ""I ain't no animal.."" is spat out finally, as she glares at him. ""An' I ain't no baby. Lemme feed m'self. I won't try'n run. I won't attack you nor yours. Not while we're eatin'. My word on it.""

""Your word is nothing, for now, Kyrie. You'll eat like a dog, or like a child until I'm convinced I won't get a fork in my eye or throat,"" he says. ""Or you can go hungry. But that's /your/ choice,"" he says, and then goes back to eating, ignoring her. That's how one treats a misbehaving child, isn't it? That's got to burn.

Several minutes go by, allowing him to continue eating while Kyrie glares at him, unable to move a muscle. The smells of the food continue to assail her, the acid in her stomach making her vaguely nauseous, as do the continuing pangs of hunger. The only thing that makes her speak again is the sure knowledge that within another day she'd be too weak to move, completely helpless against anything they might choose to do to her. ""Ya ain't gonna jam a fork in -my- throat, are ya?""

""If I wanted you dead, or unable to speak, I'd have killed you, or cut out your tongue, by now,"" the man says. ""You've already been unconscious twice -- I could've easily done away with you then,"" he promises. ""Now, what would you like to eat?"" he asks. ""There's this--"" and he gestures to what's on the table, a platter of venison, bowl of potatoes, bowl of corn, six pack of cheap beer. ""And then there's probably cupboards full of other things, as well as rations in the kitchens. I'm certainly not going to starve you to death unless you can't keep yourself behaved,"" he says mildly, sounding very... unconcerned.

""You people trained me,"" Kyrie reminds him. ""I'm pretty sure I know what you could have done while I was out.. an' I got a pretty clear idea of what ya did do."" She nods towards the platter of venison. ""That. An' beer."" She hesitates, hatred flaring in her eyes again, before managing to choke out, in a venom-soaked voice. ""Please.""

The man moves, quickly and efficiently, taking a thick slice of the roast to a plate. He cuts it up into pieces that are bite-sized, and then twists open a beer and pours it into a glass. While the head settles, he moves to sit a little close to Kyrie, and offers her a forkful of lean, juicy deermeat. It's going to be heaven. As to what they've done to her, he makes no comment; he's almost smiling as he feeds her, tense and careful. If she tries *anything* suspicious, it won't go well.

Much as Kyrie would like to take a bite out of his hand, she behaves herself. This is too important not to. Closing her lips delicately around the bite, she pulls it off of the fork, closing her eyes as the meat's juices run across her tongue. Her entire body shudders, almost orgasmically, and it's all that she can do to take her time chewing, before swallowing the bite down. Licking the juices off of her lips, she opens her eyes, staring hungrily at him. ""Another.""

And he has another ready. He lifts it to her, and will let her take it from the fork at her leisure, at her pace. After a few bites, he'll offer beer, carefully tilting the glass. He'll even wipe her lips with a napkin, and move on. Through as much of the venison as she can handle. Quickly, but not gorgingly -- he doesn't feel like dealing with her if she might vomit. That's just pointlessly disgusting.

And so it goes on, until Kyrie's eaten her fill of the venison. She doesn't gorge herself either, as tempting as the idea might be. She needs this food to remain where it is if it is to do her any good. Once the fork has been put down for the final time, she stares up at him, trying desperately to keep her voice even and controlled. ""So, if you ain't gonna kill me what -do- you want. And don't try an' feed me a line about me joinin' ya and livin' with the skirts. We both know that ain't gonna happen. Even if it could, I ain't no good to ya with the women.""

""We'll get to that later,"" he says, not quite terse. He'll put the fork down, take the plate away, wipe her lips and let her finish off the drink that he poured for her. ""For now, since you've eaten, I'm going to have you put back to sleep. There are things I have to take care of, and I want you out of the way, and resting. The more you prove to me that you can keep from tearing people apart, the more leniency you'll be granted,"" he explains, as though she were somehow at some sort of new school, and hearing the rules from the headmaster.

There's little that Kyrie can do but sit there, fuming silently. Cursing, at this point, is useless. From what she's been able to glean from this man, he'll be little moved by her tongue, however foul it might get. His words, however, offer her a glimmer of hope. If she can string them on long enough.. eventually Kenichi will realize that she's been gone too long. He'll find her, somehow. Or these people will slip up enough that she'll be able to get herself out.

He moves to lift her from the chair, and will take her back out to the hallway. He carries her gently, almost cradling her, eyeing her with something that could be taken almost like a fatherly affection, oddly enough. She can have her full belly, and it looks like she's going to be allowed to sleep, but whether that'll be in an empty cell or anywhere else is anyone's guess, at the moment.

It takes every ounce of willpower that Kyrie possesses to lie there in his arms without a hint of struggle. Every mote of hatred within her is sharp, focused, keeping her still despite the urge to rend and tear. Only months spent fighting Dracula's lingering influence give her the ability to lay, quiet and still, as he carries her out into the hallway. In a sense, she is grateful. At least they haven't set her father to this task. Then again, they know what her relationship with him is.. and they've already shown themselves to be anything but fools.

Kyrie's offered over to other men, who'll manhandle her once more and head with her down the hall. Just before they go, the man that just fed her dinner wonders, almost kindly, ""Would you like to be bathed before bed, Kyrie?"" It's like he's taking away from her all her independance. How much will she allow?

""No thanks.."" Kyrie says, her words dripping honey. ""I don't think I've really had a chance to work up a sweat. Yet. Ask me after you let me loose, maybe."" She smiles up at the men holding her, each word and gesture as sweet.. as docile as she can make it. And for each, an unspoken promise. She'll kill them all. Maim them. Leave them to bleed, slowly, while she dances in their blood.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Welcome Home"">How much time has passed, since Kyrie's capture? It's hard to tell, considering the fact that she's been drugged and kept in the dark without much human contact for.... what could be days, or maybe only hours. Finally, however, harsh light blazes down -- she's restrained with straps and buckles, given room barely enough to breathe. Naked. vulnerable. There are quiet voices in the background, talking. Nothing of consequence. Until one of them says, with obvious pleasure, ""I think she's comin' round.""

She'd clung to the dark for as long as she'd been able, once the drugs had begun leaving her system. The dark was safer.. infinitely safer.. than what was waiting for her once she opened her eyes. There came a time, though, when even keeping her eyes shut couldn't prolong the illusion of safety. Lids snap open, her entire body tensing, pulling against the straps that hold her down. Wise enough to remain silent, Kyrie stares up at her captors, hatred blazing in her eyes.

There's hatred, in return, as well as amusement. Each of the men there look upon her with the fascination one might a wounded or rabid animal. There's no real awe there, but something more like disdain and disgust. With a simple hand gesture, one man sends the other out of the room, and then moves to stand over Kyrie, pulling close a rolling metal tray. It's not easy to look around in here; the burning white-blue light is harsh and nigh blinding, directed into Kyrie's eyes. It looks as clean and sterile and unwelcoming as an operating theatre. ""Welcome home,"" he croons, reaching out a hand to trail obscenely gentle fingers through Kyrie's hair. He's recognizable -- one of the men that sat around her father's kitchen that night. The night she first killed, but never stayed to see the end.

""This ain't -home-"" Kyrie snarls, trying to jerk her head away from his hand. Lips twist as teeth and tongue worry at the dry skin in her mouth, until she can work up enough liquid to spit at him, the gesture almost meaningless. Her mouth is like the desert, not only dry but seeming to suck away at every drop of moisture she can manage to produce. Fear has her heart pounding inside her chest, rattling against her skin, try as she might to hide it.

""See, now /this/ is why you're bound, you know. Because you never knew how to act like a lady,"" the man says, smiling cruelly as he wipes the few drops of spittle from his cheek, uttering a long-suffering sigh. ""How much /easier/ it would've been,"" he says, ""if you just knew your /place/."" Flipping back the white covering on the sheet, (which is out of any reach but delightedly at her eye level -- look, look Kyrie at the wonders of steel here, just for your entertainment) he reveals a straight razor, as well as a few other implements of destruction, all pointed or bladed, serrated or sickly smooth and sharp, deadly. ""Quite a bit has changed since you ran off, you know,"" he says, talking conversationally. ""After we're done with the preparations, maybe you can have a tour,"" he murmurs, one hand reaching for the razor.

Kyrie's eyes are the only things on her moving.. the only things really capable of moving. Shifting them to the side, she tries not to react to the sight of the tray and its contents. All across her body, though, goosepimples ride her flesh. She's scars from head to toe, most of them minor and quite faded, a few of them new enough that this man wouldn't be familiar with them, especially the burn scars that lick at her palms, rising past her wrists and up her forearms. ""Ya'll never seemed to want a lady, till you couldn't pretend I was a boy,"" she mutters, forcing her gaze away from that razor.

""S'cause you were a tomboy,"" he says easily enough. ""Didn't matter that you were a girl, when you were young. When you came of age, you thought you still somehow deserved to be a part of the group n'y'did, except that you just didn't know where you belonged,"" he explains, quietly. The razor is lifted and pressed to Kyrie's scalp, then slowly, carefully dragged over the skin, cutting away black curls. ""We're going to show you where you belong,"" he murmurs.

""I belong -back- in New York City!"" Kyrie can't quite keep a pleading edge from entering her words. This man was a part of her family once. ""Please, let me go home. I won't ever tell anyone about you, I promise. But I want to go home. I.. I have a family there, now.""

""Do you?"" he says, still conversational. The razor is sharp, and handled well; it doesn't cut her skin, but provides a close shave, revealing the smooth skin of her scalp as curls drop against the table, or fall to the floor. ""It's a pity,"" he muses, sighing. ""Here we took your leaving as a sign. Your escape proved we weren't everything we could be, we weren't what we /should/ be. We should've been prepared for something like you. Now that we've come back to show you what you helped us start, I find you're not even disciplined enough to keep your voice from sounding like a whiny little girl's. Is it any wonder we wanted you with the rest of the skirts, minding the babies and tending the homefires?"" he wonders, the barest touch of a scathing tone rolling from his tongue. Light, careful fingers trace over Kyrie's skin, touching. Contact. Proving and reinforcing her helplessness.

Anger begins to chase away some of the fear coiled around Kyrie. Hatred begins to burn in her eyes again, not the sudden blaze that had erupted when she first woke up, but a more sullen flame. Careless of the blade, she tries once more to jerk her head away from him. ""I belong where -I- say I belong.""

""I have the feeling that if that was true, you wouldn't be such a miserable shit,"" he says, the barest touch of irritation thickening his speech, sharpening the edge. ""And I wouldn't move, little girl, if I were you. This is a very delicate thing I'm doing, here,"" he says coolly. ""If you're aching for more scars, I'll /give/ you more,"" he promises. ""I just want to finish what I'm doing. The cold of the room seems suddenly more evident as this goes on, it presses in with unforgiving hands, chilling, seething, crawling over newly-bared skin.

Kyrie stills once more, closing her eyes as if to shut out the feel of the razor against her skin. ""If I am a miserable shit.."" she whispers, her words as sharp and unforgiving as the razor. ""What does that make you? You and all of your men, spending all this time and effort on a worthless girl? Pathetic.""

Another sigh, and the razor moves to complete its traversal of Kyrie's flesh -- the man's quick, efficient. Heaps of black curls are brushed to the floor. It'll be cleaned up later. There's the sound of a bottle being opened; liquid splashes and hands are rubbed together. 
Suddenly, palms and fingers are slapped against the newly-shorn scalp, a freezing, burning, stinging sensation radiating over the pale skin. ""I'd watch my tongue, if I were you,"" the man hisses. ""We've come to claim what's ours. We're going to teach you your place. There's a reason the world works the way it does -- the hierarchy of man is indisputable. The supremacy of /my/ kind is indisputable. Everything will fall into place, starting with /you/. You're the last loose end before we can really move on. And there's a lot of the group that wouldn't mind seeing you just... well. Dead. But I've convinced them that it would be far more fitting to have you rejoined as one of us. There's no greater love than that of the reborn, Kyrie,"" he says, his voice fluctuating between zealous and conversational, fingers working some sort of lotion into her scalp, moving against her, an almost sensual experience -- something that could've almost been thought of as beautiful, or bonding, save that it's done without her permission, against her will -- twisted into a violation.

""You people kicked -me- out!"" Kyrie snarls back at him. ""All I ever wanted was to be.."" she stops, inhaling sharply as she struggles to get herself back under control. The feel of his fingers against her skin is loathsome, any pleasure there could have been in the touch mitigated by who and what he is. Swallowing, she forces herself to relax so that her voice can be steadier when she speaks again. ""I will never be one of you bastards again. I have another life now and I don't want no part of you.""

""You know too much, Kyrie,"" the man murmurs, finally drawing back to walk around the other side of her and stand near, wiping his hands clean. ""Far, far too much. And now there's more to what we are. And there's a place for you in it. Not with /me/. Not with the men. But with others like you,"" he says. ""You'll see. There's a place where you /belong/."" And then he's busying himself with something in a drawer, and returns to her side, prepping a syringe, flicking the bubbles to the top and pressing them out. His smile gleams white over the thick needle as he leans in. ""Sweet dreams,"" he murmurs, pressing the needle into the muscle of her upper arm, dosing her with... something.

Her eyes widen despite her attempt to remain stoic. ""No.."" pushes past her lips, a faint, gasped protest at the sight of the needle. There's so much more she wants to say, anger and denial warring in her throat, but none of the words can make it out before the needle kisses her arm, a swift sting as it plunges into muscle.

When the plunger is depressed, there's a stinging warmth that curls into Kyrie's form, pervading thought, making the world hazy, muzzy, fogged and whorling, caught as if in mist. There's no laughter, no maniacal cackle from the man holding the syringe; he puts it away and pats the arm gently, then simply leaves the girl on the table. Darkness will come, stifling, choking, ceaseless and heavy, and will try and drown away all thoughts of struggle, all hope of sight or breath. Sleep, Kyrie, sleep. Sweet dreams.
Much as she might want to fight it, there's nothing -to- fight. That is, perhaps, the worst of it for Kyrie. A physical opponent she can face. Even if she loses, at least she got to try. Here, there is nothing but helplessness, and that is more painful than a beating. Her body tenses, shuddering under conflicting impulses, until the drug sets in..forcing her to relax, back down into the dark.

When the darkness finally recedes, Kyrie will find herself in a tiny cell, alone. There's a window, but it's barred, and lets in very little light. There's no bed, and no furniture, nothing that could be used to harm someone, or oneself. No blanket, bed, pillow, mattress... nothing. It's worse than a dog's kennel. About now, Kyrie's probably beginning to feel the suffering that comes from a lack of calories -- if they've fed her, it's not been enough. Not nearly enough. She's still naked, with her shorn head, and now she'll be able to feel a new pain, distinct and unforgettable. It's the kind that comes from being held down, pinned, legs spread. Hips feel sore and to shift causes thrills of agony to jar the pelvis, electric pain running through bone. Bruises and scratches are further evidence of brutal abuse, but the drugs will keep her from remembering details. Perhaps that's a good thing.

In the beginning, the discomfort in her stomach is worse than any of the others. It makes it difficult to think, her belly rumbling and aching. This isn't the first time that Kyrie's been hungry, though, and after a few minutes self-discipline begins to assert itself. She stands up from her position on the floor, shifting from foot to foot to stretch cramped muscles. She can feel the other aches and pains, scratches stinging and bruises sending a deeper shudder of pain through her, but her mind skitters away from them, unwilling to dwell on what might have caused them. Instead, she studies her surroundings, pacing the walls and the floor, examining the door and the window as she tries to figure some way out of this mess.

The door's a bland, relatively featureless sheet of some kind of metal, thick and unforgiving. This side is smooth, without hinges--there's a tiny portal that can be opened from the other side, to see in--this side's got wire-reinforced safety glass. The window itself is fogged, wire-reinforced saftey glass, and there are bars, to boot. Echoing voices and footsteps can be heard going past, outside this particular room. Time passes, but slowly. Hunger grows worse. Drugs leave behind a bitter aftertaste on the tongue, and won't leave her completely lucid just yet.

Fingertips worry at the window for bare moments before she's giving up on that route. Her footsteps echo those outside eerily as she steps into the march without thinking. Pace pace pace.. wall. Turn, pace pace pace.. wall. Slowly, the exercise is forcing the last of the drugs from her system. Unfortunately, it's also sharpening Kyrie's hunger. There's nothing in here, nothing that can be used to escape. Nothing that will make a weapon. They know her too well to leave her so much as a blanket or a button. It doesn't matter, she tries to tell herself. Her body is a weapon. Somehow, though, in this tiny cell.. that's not as reassuring as it might have been otherwise.

Eventually, footsteps stop outside the door, and the little cover is slid away from the window. Someone looks in for a moment, an unrecognizable face. It's then that a disembodied voice tells Kyrie to ""Put your hands against the back wall. Spread your legs and stand still. There will be a gun trained on you -- if you put up resistance, you will be shot."""

"event","<lj-cut text=""A Walk in the Park"">It's a perfect night, especially for New York City. Cool, the air crisp and so bright with cold that it smokes in your lungs. Wisps of fog roll across the paths, and there's a tint of moisture to the night that might be rain, could be snow. Too soon to tell. Other parts of the park are bright, yet, yellow lights pushing back the night.. but not here. This part of the park is deserted, or almost so. The lamps here are few and scattered widely, flickering lights off in the distance, surrounded by wide pools of shadow.

Kyrie loves this part of the park..particularly at night. Here she can almost pretend that the city doesn't exist. Perched in a branch above the path, she watches quietly for a moment before dropping down to the ground. She's trying not to think of the last time she was here.. but it's hard, especially here, on a night like this. It brings the memories back, and she's torn between running from them, and savoring them. It had been brutal. It had been wrong. It had been the some of the finest hunting of her life... and so right it frightened her, even now. Lost in thought, she's drifting from tree to tree, her path meandering in and out of the shadows. Soon.. she'll run, and she'll forget all of this for a few more hours. Not yet, though.

There are no perfect nights for Piotr Rasputin these days. Not anymore. There weren't supposed to be ANY more nights for Piotr Rasputin after the last two years of his life exploded all over him. But here he is, dressed all in black like he's one of those Village goth vampire people, although they're rarely as burly and well-developed as he is. He walks through the park absently, as he's been walking around the city for an hour and a half now, running over that ridiculous ""magic"" experience he had not that long ago. Must find Wisdom. Must grab his throat and pin him against a wall until he explains just what the fuck happened. The feeling of destroying an entire world does NOT sit well. The path he walks on is only a little ways away from the girl that tried to save him that night, despite proclaiming herself evil and broken, but he's wrapped up enough in himself not to notice.

There are other sets of eyes, others in the trees, others who have tracked her like prey, and are closing in, closing in -- the presence of Piotr doesn't deter them. They're willing to deal with others that get in the way. She's the important bit. All but silent -- those that get in closer have their hearts beating almost in their throats -- they've been waiting a long time for this. Too long. But it's finally in the works, and whether or not that lummox is in the way, nothing's going to stop them from doing what they want. Flashes of movement in the shadow, quick and quiet and barely seen. They draw ever closer, waiting for her to close herself off in shadow.

Wrapped in memory and self-pity, Kyrie doesn't realize that she's attracted followers.. or that these same people following her have been doing so for quite some time. Every memory of every hunt haunts her, filling her mind with shadows of bloodlust and sending shivers of adrenaline tingling along her muscles... every memory followed by other memories. She can't shut out the look on that priest's face when he died. She can't forget the feeling of his blood on her face, on her hands.. the way he'd died, while she held him and watched. Eyes unaccustomed to tears burn, and she shakes her head almost angrily. Inhaling a lungful of the cold night air, Kyrie lets it out in a muffled curse, ducking her head and darting between the trees.. finally allowing herself to run, at least long enough to lose herself in the shadows beneath the trees.

It's the running that does it. Someone within his field of view, although a good twenty yards or so away from him at the moment, and on a different pathway than he is, but it draws Piotr out of his own little wallowing. Wait... was that...? After a moment, the fact that she's running through the park registers in his head, and it could very well mean that she's in some kind of trouble. Hell, it's Kyrie. It almost guarantees it. Knowing a little bit about such trouble, he knows not to just call out her name and let pursuers know where she is. He does break into a jog himself, toward the area where she disappeared into the shadows, looking around sharply for any sense of the situation. He does owe her one, and if he can pay it back now, that's one thing off his mind.

When she runs, more than one of the followers curses his luck -- has she seen them? But no, no, that's what she /does/. Running. Their mood settles out; they move as one to close in after her, when Piotr moves to follow. In the night noises, will anyone hear the sound of guns being cocked? Will anyone hear a few more forms drop down out of trees losing the last of their leaves? She runs into the shadows, trying to get away, to slip into where she can forget, not wanting to see where she's failed, where she's done wrong. But that means she's running into a group of them, a knot that's ready and waiting. Even as hidden as they are, there's the sudden and overwhelming realization -- at least for a split second -- that she's not alone. That she's /not at all/ alone. The trees in the park are full of traitors. The night has eyes, and it's hungry, Kyrie. It's gotten a taste for you.

Time seems to freeze for a moment, within that nest of shadows. Hands on her knees, sweat dripping from her forehead to the ground below, Kyrie senses the eyes before she sees her companions. A long moment, when her heart seems to slow into nothingness, when she can feel her tongue dry, breath stilling in her throat. She's spent the last several years of her life running.. and when she straightens up and acknowledges what's around her, everything seems to fall into place. Running. To this place. To them. It was inevitable. She always knew that. Unable to say a word, she turns slowly in place, meeting eyes.. new eyes, and old. Faces she's fought against, beside. Newcomers she's never seen, never known. She can see recognition in every pair. They know her. What felt like minutes, could only have been seconds, snaps. Too late, she's falling back into fighting stance, hands reaching for guns that aren't there, finding only the hilts of her knives beneath her shirt.

While time is freezing for Kyrie, it's only slowing down and feeling awkward for Piotr, who has to duck under some of the trees she's vanished into, and he's wondering if pursuing her is the right thing to do. Maybe just leave her alone to her night wanderings. She's probably not gonna be happy to SEE him in any form, after that cheap shot. He clears away a bit of brush and catches sight of her in the distance... in a fighting stance, squaring off against... apparently, nobody. They're hidden well. He blinks a little, hanging back and realizing how well he does NOT know this girl.

They step out of where they were hidden; a full circle that moves to close around her. Except those at her back turn, looking in Piotr's direction. Trusting their team to take care of her while they watch for someone who might decide to play Good Samaritan. ""Kyrie, honey, did you think you could just stay out of our sight forever?"" a man snarls, lifting his gun. Most of the rest of them do likewise. ""If you come quietly, we won't shoot your big lug of a boyfriend,"" he says, smiling tightly.

Only then does Kyrie realize that she's got more company than she first realized. Her eyes close for a split second, and even she couldn't say if what comes out of her mouth is a prayer, a curse or something somewhere in between the two. When her eyes open again, though.. those who don't know her, who didn't train her and train beside her get some idea of what it was that went through the hell they called a school. Her eyes are empty, her face a blank that gives no clue to the thoughts inside. She doesn't waste time with witty repartee. Piotr will have to look after himself. Falling into a crouch, Kyrie whirls with near inhuman speed, knives falling into the palms of her hands with a grace that is beautiful despite their intent. Spinning, her arms fall open, elbows locking as the blades become an extension of small hands, fingers.. reaching to kiss as many as knife-point can touch. Even then she knows.. she won't win. She can't win. There's too many of them. But she's damned if they'll drag her down unblooded.

Piotr widens his eyes at this as people emerge from the shadows and the very trees. The kinds of people he keeps expecting might be after HIM these days, too. He's hesitant to do anything, and he raises empty palms out in front of him for a moment, as a sign that he means no harm... but as he looks for some sort of visual cue from Kyrie, he gets nothing but a whirl into defensive action, and that's all the cue he needs. Thankfully, HE'S packing heat, and he ducks back a moment behind the brush and draws two 9mm glocks as quickly as he can, hoping he can do this without outing himself to these spooks, and immediately hunching down and starting a half-circle to spring out from a different place and open fire if he has to... if he CAN.

A few of them look irritated that Piotr's got a gun, while one of them looks vaguely amused, almost pleased. As though this somehow made it fair. It's now a man's duel. /Their/ guns are silenced. Some of them are guns with the kinds of bullets that send you down for the big dirt nap, but some of them are only loaded with tranquilizer darts. For the moment, tranquilizer darts will be fired at both Kyrie and Piotr. They're not stupid--they're not going to /engage/ either of them. All the same, one man will go down in a flash of blood, gurgling as he struggles to keep her occupied while the rest take aim and pull triggers. He may die, but he won't let /her/ get away. Real bullets will happen if the darts can't manage their job. No orders are barked; the men move like a well-oiled machine, darkly-painted faces wearing grim, determined expressions.

Kyrie can't help the thrill that shudders through her as blood sprays over her hands. The hunger that the vampire woke in her isn't completely gone.. some shreds of it linger still in the back of her brain, in the primitive part of her psyche. Without her guns, she's crippled, but not dead.. and inside she's exultant. Look! Look at what you threw away! Shoving the body away, watching it roll over, so much meat.. her knives dark with gore, Kyrie stands. Two darts hit her, shoving her back a step, quivering in her stomach and her shoulders. Brown eyes darken with anger. Her pulse is racing, a familiar cadence that sings inside her with the adrenaline in her blood. The tranquilizers slow that dance, but they can't stop it immediately. It will take more than just a couple of darts to slow what's happening beneath her skin. Some rational part of her mind is trying for calm, trying to slow her heartbeat, to stem the flood of adrenaline, but it's losing the battle.

Piotr isn't expecting tranqs, and even silenced, they fly with a sound different enough from a bullet to distract him, which is enough to get him nailed in the thigh with one. Fuck. He yanks it out and scowls as soon as he spots it, knowing he doesn't have enough time to pull this off, banking on the fact that he's big enough to slough it off for long enough to make a dent. Quickly, he bursts from the brush rather low for his size, aiming for kneecaps first and faces next, aiming to cripple and slow these stealthy pricks down before finishing them off. Easier to handle. Dammit, he can feel the fuzz creeping in already, as he rolls along the ground, aiming to duck behind another tree and see where to fire next.

Some of them drop. But only some. Bullets meaning to kneecap drop some of them for but a moment before they get up, gritting their teeth, snarling curses, limping to regroup, to keep firing. Bulletproof armor. These men are /prepared/. For some of it. More darts, and then actual bullets, finally. Not to kill. Not to kill Kyrie, at any rate. And whether it's out of mercy or the fact that Piotr simply wasn't their target, they don't go for the kill for him, either. They shoot for feet, shoulders, knees, arms. Harder targets, but painful enough to dissuade dissent. Some of them are laughing at Kyrie, taunting her. One even spits at her after he pulls the trigger.

There's a roaring in her ears. Her heart is lurching in her chest.. and then it all smooths out. With the tranquilizers working against her, she's got thirty seconds.. fourty-five tops.. but for those seconds she moves like nothing they've ever seen before. If their surveillance hadn't already keyed them in on the fact that she's a mutant.. this certainly would. Overdrive. It's the only word she and Kenichi had been able to come up with that fit. The darts continue to hit, clinging to arms, thighs.. every part of her body that has any meat to spare, but she doesn't even seem to notice them. Her knife flashes again and again, lunging for any piece of flesh she can reach.. but it's clumsy now. These aren't the smooth, polished moves of a professional. She's a drunken bear on ice, adrenaline and tranqs warring for control of a body gone out of control. When real bullets replace the tranqs, it's only a matter of time.. one simple bullet. She can feel it buzz over her shoulder, smoking fabric as it knocks her backwards. Too late, she tries to pull out of the fall, but her muscles aren't obeying her anymore. Unconscious before she hits the ground, she crumples, knives falling when she does, to lie in a small heap in the dead leaves and the shadows.

Piotr is pinned down for a bit behind the tree as the bullets splay bark and chunks of wood around him. Don't pass out, don't pass out, adrenaline adrenaline, keep it up. He has no idea if shifting into metal form would put a stop to the fading or not, but he might have to give it a go. He manages to dart his head around enough to see Kyrie... they're after her, they're trying to CAPTURE her... dammit, they nailed her. That's it. Can't let this happen when he owes her one. Quickly, there's a shift into his metal form, and the gleaming hulk storms out of hiding and just opens relentless fire on any targets he can find... and he's a good shot... and he even tries to draw their attention. ""Take me on, motherfuckers!"" Faces, eyes, throats. There's no mercy now.

No mercy asked, no mercy given, no quarter granted. Some drop and are hauled away by their compatriots. Several move to bag Kyrie, literally, tying her with plastic slipcord, and stuffing her into a large duffel. The rest open fire on Piotr. Muzzles flash, but the sound is lost to the night -- the presence of large-scale gunfire would bring police far too quickly. They just want Piotr to drop, and then they'll be gone.

Piotr doesn't drop, though... and his guns haven't bothered with the silencers - they're still stitting in his pocket. The muzzle flashes and the reflective pings off of his metal skin make an interesting light show, and the effect it does have, being concentrated towards his head, is that he can't get a good look at what's going on, and it affects his aim. He has to lift an arm to deflect the bullets from his eyes so he can see... and his other hand keeps firing. Loudly. ""Let her go! Back OFF!"" He stalks toward Kyrie's position as fast as he can, breaking into a heavy sprint to try and get to her before it's too late.</lj-cut>"

"event","Since I can't get to my logs right now (beings as my other hard drive is in the old computer gathering dust) I'm going to start this journal back up quite a ways into the future. To catch people up quickly, here's a quick synopsis of events that will be missed:

Kyrie is now living with Kenichi, her boyfriend (god she hates that word). She's had a nasty fight with Dracula, who drove her close to insane. Dracula's death at the hands of many of the city's heroes freed her from his hold. For a time all was as peaceful as it ever is, but recent events have turned things into quite a mess for her."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Batwing finds a place to stay."">Some of the lack of comprehension goes away at the comments of the free-for-all. ""It's _take_ that many to actually handle a mutant."" he says with amusement. He shifts his arm, looking at the play of wing up and down it, before folding it back beneath him and tipping the bottle up for another drink. ""Don't suppose they'd have an opening? Or... I guess you've got to leave them alive, huh."" Yes, it does almost sound like he's disappointed at that.

Kyrie doesn't seem at all bothered by the comment about leaving them alive. ""Well, they prefer it most of the time, but if you fuck up in the underground matches and someone dies, well..them's the breaks. The deathmatches, though..I don't -do- those most of the time, but the whole point is to be the last one left alive. And there aren't any rules at all."" She looks you over, considering, while she sips at her beer. ""You'd have problems..too obvious a mutant, but I've heard rumours that they might start up underground fights with mutants, humans..whatever climbs into the ring. You want me to look into it?""

Batwing gives a much displeased sound at the 'too obvious' comment, though it's not at you. It's in general. ""I'm not interested in fighting other mutants, though."" he says. ""Nngh. Might need to, though. Better fighting other mutants for mutants than... sorry."" Yeah, the apology was quite sincere, too. ""Beating a dead horse."" Some phrases stay the same no matter where, or when, you are. ""But yeah. If you could look into those, I'd appreciate it."" Another shuffle of straightening wings as he shifts his position on the couch, re-adjusting the drape-seat.

Watching you shift about, Kyrie frowns for a moment. ""That can't be comfortable,"" she says finally. ""Might try taking out the cushion behind ya. I'll look around t'morrow, see if there's anything out there that would be easier to sit in for ya."" She shakes her head. ""And I'll look into the fight thing. I heard there was gonna be a big match sometime next week. Be a good time to get some info. I'll prolly sign up for a few matches, see what I can find out while I'm there.""

""Human furniture wasn't made for mutants."" Batwing quips, as he twists to eye the cushion, then shrugs and gives it a tug, giving him a little more room for a seat. ""but thanks. Don't need to worry too much. I make do. Just gotta find the right position."" Which usually involves either 'sprawl' or 'back to front'. Either-or. ""Thanks. Hope you can find something. Gotta do _something_ with myself. Can't just spend the whole time flying around and doing nothing."" Of course, once he finds out about Friends Of Humanity, he won't be doing 'nothing' too much longer...

And maybe that's the /biggest/ reason for her fighting. 'Yeah..I know. I spend too much time in this damned place. I mean..it's nice to have it, I ain't complainin', but..you look at the same walls all the time, and it starts feelin' like a cage."" She empties the bottle, and sets it aside. ""Gotta keep busy, keep movin..keeps you from losin' your mind."" She eyes him again. ""Might be..you.. you don't got no problems with killin humans, do you?"" she asks suddenly. She wouldn't ask, but riding the buzz she's got..it's too easy.

Batwing almost inhales a mouthful of beer at the question, managing to swallow it before he laughs. ""Got no problem at all with it."" he says deliberately wiping his hand across his mouth to dry up anything that spattered with the snerk. ""Done it before, I'll do it again. I asked about the killing in the matches, didn't I?"" Well, indirectly, maybe he did. ""Why?""

Kyrie shrugs. ""I get jobs once in a while..take somebody who's causing trouble here and there, and make them..not a problem anymore. And yeah, it's working for humans, but hell..it's /damned/ good money. You wouldn't be workin' for them anyway..you'd be workin' for me. They give me the contract, and I subcontract out to you..some jobs I think..be a helluva lot easier if you got wings. Would open up the kinds of jobs I can take if I had somebody to work with..""

""Oh. So you do assassin work."" The boy's blunt as a spoon, isn't he? ""Hnngh."" Batwing's eyes slit a little as he tries to muddle through the little 'hierarchy'. Apparently, from the sour look on his face, he decides that he doesn't much like it. Still... ""I could handle taking out a job like that. Getting paid to kill humans."" A slow nod as he mulls this over. ""Yeah, I could enjoy a job like that."" The drunken smile that spreads over his face could either be eerie, or amusing, depending on which side you were looking from.

""Yeah,"" Kyrie says quietly, uncertainty creeping into her eyes for a moment while she watches you, and then she shrugs, a hesitant chuckle working its way out of her throat. ""I ain't never thought about workin' with nobody before, but hell..gotta try new things once in a while, and there's plenty of jobs I ain't touched before cuz they were too risky, or just too damned difficult on my own, but.. with somebody like you to help.. I think we could make some damned decent money, and have ourselves some kicks while we're doin' it.""

Batwing nods willingly at that. ""Good work,"" he agrees. ""An' I'm used to working with other folks. It shouldn't be a problem. And it'll be a ton of fun, you just wait and see."" Eventually, Kyrie will learn that her idea of 'fun' might not be the same as Batwing's idea of 'fun'. Of course, she may well already have the idea. ""Never considered something like that too risky. Then again, guess it's different when you're grounded. Still, be nice to have someone who c'n watch my back while I'm recharging.""

Okay, that's gotten her attention, muzzy though it might be. ""Rechargin?"" she asks, tilting her head. Never having been one to consider killing ""fun""..hell, it's just a -job-. Like delivering the mail or bagging groceries...the rest of what you've said goes right over her head, but she is curious over the ""recharging"" comment.

Batwing trusts himself enough, even drunk, to bring his hand up and focus a dancing wave of energy across the clawed fingertips. ""See, I can only do so much 'fore I need to recharge."" he explains as he lets that be seen. ""S'a real pain in the ass sometimes. So it's nice to have someone watching my back."" The shimmer of bio-energy vanishes as suddenly as it appeared.

Kyrie grins, sitting up and leaning forward. ""COOL!"" she says, pushing herself to her feet, and wandering closer. ""What is that stuff? I heard of some people can do stuff like that. Not me..hell, it took me time to figure out not everybody could move like I do..or see stuff.."" she frowns, not certain she wants to even -try- to explain that. ""So..kinda like a battery, huh?""

Batwing is willing to try and get her to explain it, though. ""See stuff?"" He says it in curiosity, not in the 'You must be crazy!' tone. Hell, with some of the stuff he's dealt with, for all he knows, she's seeing ghosts. Wouldn't that be a trip? ""S'just bio-energy."" he says rather casually, shrugging his shoulders. Fingers shimmer again, to let you look. That's not a problem. That, he can hold pretty much forever. ""Yeah. Guess so. Don't know where the recharger is, but it kinda works itself. Just gotta take a little time. Me 'n Blaster... we both could do stuff like this. Just a little different kind of energy.""

Curious fingers reach towards the shimmer you hold so casually, never considering the danger it might represent. Yes, she's young..and while she's been hurt numerous times in the ring, she still maintains that touch of..naivete... where such abilities are concerned. ""I..dunno how to 'splain it,"" she says quietly. ""I...just know where stuff is. And where to shoot, or throw stuff, to make it hit how I want it too.""

""Careful."" says Batwing, though he doesn't move the hand away. ""It bites."" Although he's got it on low enough that it won't be much more than a shock. Brushing a finger across a weak live wire. Yeah, it'll sting, but unless she's particularly sensitive, Kyrie won't end up too hurt. Hell, for all he knows, she likes that sort of sting. ""I guess I got what you're sayin'. Kinda."" Not any wording that Batwing has, either, but then, he can see where trying to explain stuff like that would be a pain in the ass. ""Good power."" he says solemnly. ""Must be great with a gun. It work when you're riding stuff, too?""

There's a faint *pop* as Kyrie touches the shimmering energy, and a moment later she's sucking on the tip of her finger, looking startled..and then she starts to laugh. ""Curiousity killed and all that.."" she mutters around her finger, pulling it out of her mouth and shaking it slightly. ""Weird..and yeah, it does. Works anytime, long as I can /see/. And..well, I just remember it. See.."" she picks up her empty beer bottle, and pitches it up into the air, one hand lashing out to bap it as it starts to descend. The bottle shoots across the room, smacks into the wall above the garbage can, and falls in. ""Yeah..helps a /lot/ with the shooting.""

Batwing laughs as well, killing the shimmer again, downing the rest of his own bottle. He doesn't make an attempt to do the same, though, just setting it down on the table and sprawling once more. This time, it's not so much a matter of comfort as a matter of being rather wasted. ""Should get a skyboard of some sort."" he says, making a gliding motion with one hand as though to punctuate what he means. As though this were something that were relatively easy to get? ""Probably be easy for you to ride, and you'd be able to get that flight thing going that you wanted. Not that I'd want to be out of a job, though."" Another laugh.

Kyrie blinks muzzily at you. ""A skyboard?"" she asks, pushing herself upright, and offering you a hand. ""C'mon..getcher ass off the couch or you will end up sleepin' on it. You're..blasted.."" she shakes her head, wavering a bit in place herself. Apparently, she's got little ground to stand on, when it comes to being blasted. ""Or you want me to get you pillows and stuff? Don' care if you sleep out here, if you're too wasted to get to the room.""

Batwing accepts the hand up, sprawling himself to his feet, the leathern wing-sails spreading habitually as though they'd help him catch his balance. Fortunately, they aren't as wide as true wings, so he doesn't go knocking everything over. ""Am not. M'just a little lightheaded is all."" Yeah. Right. He's blasted. ""I can get to the room. And you know. Airboard."" He looks at her for a moment, then realizes: ""No. You _don't_ know. Right."" His hand rubs against his brow. ""Uh. Kinda... uh... it's a flying platform. You guide it with your body. Just gotta know how to lean and where to stand.""

Kyrie is out of the way of the wings almost before they begin to spread. Yup. Useful talent to have. She grins up at you, her eyes sparkling. ""Never seen nothin' like that..but /damn/ wouldn't it be fun? Like surfin' only in the sky.."" She hesitates, her drunken mind catching up with reality. ""Like that Surfer dude I've heard about. He rides some weird surfboard thing.."" She makes her careful way over to the guest room, opening the door and flipping on the lights. ""Not much in the way of furniture, sorry..but it's comfy. And you need anything we can manage to pick it up. Just tell me..""

Batwing blinks muzzily. ""Surfer Dude? Never heard of him. Guess it shouldn't be surprising."" He follows her into the room, not really bothered by the lack. There's a bed. A bed is pretty good. ""And yeah. It sorta is, really. Rid on-... I mean, I ridden on-... I mean... shit, I _am_ drunk."" He pauses a moment to get his head back on straight. ""I _rode_ on one before. Couple'a times, actually. S'only way Rhodney could keep up with me, mostly.""

Kyrie laughs quietly, steering you towards the bed. ""Who's Rhodney?"" she asks, letting you get the rest of the way there yourself, and plopping herself down into another corner. ""'sokay..I'm kinda wobbly myself. Good thing I don' have to fight tomorrow, or I'd be screwed..."" She folds her knees to her chest, resting her head on them, watching you with no little amusement.

Beds are easier to sit on. There's nothing in the way. Although he still almost topples over backward, for that samesuch reason; nothing to lean against to keep himself upright. ""Rhodney. He was my boyfriend."" answers Batwing as he catches himself, letting his arms plop across his knees so he doesn't end up toppling over after all. ""Good looking guy. Green skin. Absolute _hell_ on a skyboard."" His eyes turn wistful. ""_Damn_ I miss him.""

Kyrie nods, with a faint sigh. Figures. First cute mutant she meets, and he's -gay-. Ahh well. ""I'm sorry,"" she says quietly. ""That..sucks. I mean, getting dragged here and losing the people you care about.."" she doesn't really know what else to say, much as she'd like to find /something/ to say that would make you feel better. She's always made a point of travelling light. No claims on her heart. Life is safer that way.

Fortunately, he's either over it enough that he doesn't bust out crying, or he's just drunk enough not to show it. Because other than that comment and the wistful look, he sets it aside. Life goes on. Que cera cera. ""Yeah, but I figure... I ever find the guy who took him out again, I'll go from there. Maybe the crystal... thing..."" His hand waves vaguely. ""... will drag _him_ here, too.""

You say ""Weirder things have happened,"" Kyrie agrees, tucking that name away along with the others you've given her. ""You gotta hope anyway.."" She shrugs. ""Anyways..we don't have nothing like that skyboard you're talking about. Got surfboards, for riding the waves, and I'll show you my motorcycle tomorrow..but..that's about it, I'm afraid. Your job is safe for a while.""""

Batwing presses his lips together. ""Oh, well. That's gotta suck. For you."" And he gives a laugh, even if that joke wasn't that funny. ""S'good, though. Means I've got more of a chance to get in with stuff, and not have to worry about you taking over all the fun jobs, huh?"" Another shift, so he can flop over on his side, head propped up on his hand so he can look at Kyrie a little more easily. ""Who knows. Maybe someone'll figure out how to make one, so you can at least keep up with me."" Yeah, he saw you running. There's a note of teasing in the words, rather than seriousness.

Leaning back against the wall, Kyrie laughs easily, a rolling chuckle that bounces off the walls. ""Yeah..and wouldn't that be cool.."" she says, shaking her head before reaching to catch it. Feels like the damned thing might roll itself right off of her shoulders. ""You cheat, y'know. Flyin like that..damn but I wish.."" she sighs wistfully. ""It must be really cool...touchin' the sky like that. Sometimes, when I'm runnin', it almost feels like I could..but.."" she shrugs. ""Not my gift, y'know?""

Batwing nods muzzily. ""Yeah. Yeah. I gotcha. You got the jumping around and hitting stuff. I had to learn to do that. Had to learn to fly, too, but that was a li'l easier. Tell you what; one o' these days, I'll see if I can take you flying. You look pretty small. I think I could pick you up juuuuuust fine.""

Yeah, Kyrie is small. Five foot nothin', and you've likely carried suitcases that weigh more than she does. ""Really?"" she asks, her entire face brightening. ""You could do that? I've never even been in a plane before..that.."" she stops, suddenly aware that she sounds like a giddy kid..which is more or less what she /is/. ""That would be awesome, Bats. Thank you.""

Batwing scratches at his head, pushing his hair back for a moment. It flops drunkenly into one eye as soon as the hand leaves, though. ""No problem. I don't think you could weigh that much. Just gotta see if I can figure out some way to carry you without crimping the wings."" That, of course, will be the hard part. ""Maybe if you just hang on or something...?""

Kyrie considers that for a moment, and then nods. ""Sure I could,"" she says confidently, rolling forward to tuck that errant hair back behind your ear. ""Much training as I've done, my arms are a lot stronger than most chicks. They gotta be, or I'd get pummelled in the ring, no matter how fast I am. You can only stay outta the way /so/ long, and you gotta be able to hit back, and make it count.""

Batwing shuts his eye so Kyrie can sweep that hair back into place, then re-opens them again, reaching out to curiously prod at the nearby arm. It's right there. He can't help it. He's curious about whether you're telling the truth about that muscle or not. I mean, you're _teeny_. You know how it is. ""Figured you just did it through speed."" he says, even though you just mentioned otherwise. ""Guess't makes sense, though. Can't win a fight if you can't get 'em back hard enough to make the difference.""

She might be teeny, but there's little to no body fat on her. Just hips, and breasts, and they're scaled to be of a size with her. The muscles under the skin of her arm, while not brute and bulging, are firm, moving smoothly under her skin. She doesn't move as he prods her arm. It's a familiar enough thing, though it does narrow her lips a bit. ""Yeah. Even if I am a girl, and a little one at that, I do have a few muscles..""

Batwing can't help it! He was curious! ""Man. Where do you keep it all?"" he wonders, looking surprised at the firm muscle underneath. ""Bet you hit like a ton of bricks."" He brings the hand back to brace himself in the 'seat' once more. ""Got more'n a few, I'd say. More man than some men I know."" With that, though, he actually seems to realize what he's saying, and blinks owlishly at himself. ""I think that Jack is kicking my ass."" he asides.

Kyrie chuckles, folding her arms around her knees again. ""Had a sports doc explain it to me once, though he didn't get all of it. I got this really high..met..met..I burn my food really really fast. 'shwy I have to eat so much meat and stuff. If I don't, my body starts eating my muscles real quick. Not much fat in there..so I gotta eat stuff with lots of.."" she frowns, struggling for the words. ""You know..sugars and stuff. Breads, potatoes, that kinda stuff..""

Batwing might not be a scientist, but he's got the gist of it. ""Gotta eat to keep up with yourself. Yeah. I getcha. Makes sense."" Drawing a breath, he works on getting himself straightened out at least a little bit. ""Eat like a pig, never gain a pound. Know a couple girls who would'a killed for that.""

Grinning mischievously, Kyrie stretches, slowly pushing herself to her feet. ""Yeah..but then again, they haven't seen my grocery bill,"" she retorts, idly ruffling his hair as she heads for the door. ""I'm gonna sack out. You want the shower, help yourself. Like I said, stuffs all in there. Whatevers in the kitchen too..""

Batwing drags himself back along the bed again. ""Right. No problem. Uh. Don't suppose you got something I can sleep in, do you?"" Yeah, he doesn't look as though he's hopeful, eyeing the edge of the wing. Even if she had something that fit, he doubts it would _fit_ fit. Sometimes, wings suck. Stuff just wasn't built for them.

Pausing at the doorway, Kyrie looks back at him and nearly snickers. ""Dude, I'm about half your size. Even if had something you could get -into-, we'd still have to slit holes in it for your wings."" She laughs, shaking her head. ""Sleep in the raw..there's plenty of blankets.""

Don't worry, Kyrie. Batwing wasn't completely serious about that either. ""Works for me."" he says as he works on de-shirting himself. Body-shy? Only enough to make sure he either gets Kyrie out of there, or warns her, before he ducks out of the pants. ""I'll probably grab that shower in a minute. Once I've gotten a break."" AKA: once he's woken up from however long the alcohol's going to put him under?

Kyrie's not body shy either, but neither is she overly curious, or rude. So she simply nods, lifting a hand in farewell, and slips out of the room. She pauses only one more time, at the door. ""My room's the next one over,"" she says quietly. ""You need anything, come on in..I'm a light sleeper. But DON'T touch me. Just talk to me. I'll wake up."" Startling Kyrie awake isn't a good thing. She tends to sleep with her guns.

Batwing gives a nod and scoots under the covers to undress the rest of the way. ""Right."" he calls after her. ""G'night, Kyrie."" And that shower? Forgotten about. At least until he wakes tomorrow.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""A little dinner, a lot of JD, and the beginnings of what will become a lasting friendship..most of the time."">Dishes clatter in the kitchen, the sounds of pots and pans being moved around. ""Okay,"" Kyrie calls out finally. It's a few more minutes, giving ample time to look around, if you were so inclined, and then she pokes her head out. ""Whatcha want to drink? I got beer, cokes, juice..whatever.."" She waits for your answer and then heads back into the kitchen.

When she reappears the next time, she's carrying two plates. One is fairly modestly burdened. There's a nice sized steak, a baked potato, and thick slices of french bread. The other is /loaded/. The steak alone takes up half the plate, and there are two potatoes. No bread..there's simply no room, but that's okay, the rest of the loaf of french bread is tucked up under one arm. She sets the plates down on the table. ""I'll get the drinks and be right back. What do you want on your tatoes?""

Batwing isn't a teetotaller. ""Beer. Thanks. Or whatever else you've got alcoholic."" Besides, considering the day he's got? The stronger the drink, the better. There needs to be a 'new arrivals' bar. ""And whatever you've got for the potato. Butter's fine."" At least he's not too picky about food. He looks quite satisfied to take the steak and plate as is. And he actually doesn't give the differing sizes of the plate anything more than a glance. There's a rule: beggars can't be choosers. And while he's too good to be a beggar, he _is_ the one who's being fed, rather than doing the feeding. He's not going to complain about discrepancies. Not like he could eat much more than that, anyway. He might have a healthy appetite, but that's _beyond_ healthy.

Kyrie grins, and heads back into the kitchen, re-emerging with a bottle of Jack and a couple of shot glasses, and two Sam Adams. ""Here..something strong to take the edge off..and something mellow to smooth it out,"" She sets them down, and fetches butter and sour cream. ""There's a couple more baked potatoes in the kitchen, if you want more when you're done, and another steak. Just help yourself. I ain't all formal or nothin' here.""

Batwing nods. ""Thanks."" he says, shifting forward to be able to reach the food with his legs still folded, balancing in a position that could only be comfortable if one was either quite flexible, or used to it. ""Are you really going to eat that whole thing on your own?"" he asks rather casually, as he packs the butter and sour cream into the potato, then lets them melt together a little while he pours, then downs, a shot of the Jack Daniels.

Tucking into the food, Kyrie pauses while cutting off a hunk of the steak. Looking down at her plate, she colors a bit. ""I..have too.."" she says after a moment. ""If I don't, I'll start getting real sick. I..can't go long at all without lotsa meat and stuff, or.."" she shudders. ""It ain't good.""

Batwing shrugs his shoulders as he cuts a piece of his own. ""Doesn't matter to me."" he informs her. ""I was just asking."" And indeed, he doesn't look at her as though she were a freak for it or anything. Hell, he thought she was more of a freak for working for _humans_. Far be it for the guy with wings to look strangely at the girl who eats more than normal. It's all part of the blessing. Gotta take the bad with the good. And there's way more good than bad. The Sam Adams is, indeed, employed to help that shot go down, and he tucks into his food as he lets those two drinks settle for the moment.

Not much of a whiskey drinker herself, Kyrie pours a shot, and downs it quickly, using the beer to wash the taste away before taking another bite of steak. ""Is all good,"" she mutters, once she's swallowed. ""It's not like its something awful, but its why I have to do the work I do. At least that pays good 'nough to keep my fridge full. Working for humans may suck, but there's too damned many of them to have much choice..""

Oh yes. That's right. That conversation again. ""I still don't know how you can stomach it."" he says, the meat tucked in against his cheek as he talks, before he resumes chewing the mouthful and swallowing. ""I mean,"" he says, mouth cleared, ""with what you could do, you could get mutants together and take what you wanted, rather than having to work for... for _them_ for it."" Yes, they're a _them_. ""You can't tell me there aren't mutants who are working among their kind, setting something like that up.""

Kyrie sighs, starting in on her potato before she even tries to respond. Washing that down with more beer, she leans back in her chair, eyeing him across the table. ""Don't take this wrong,"" she says quietly. ""But you sound a lot like my dad. Only with him it was 'them fuckin' chinks,' or 'it's the goddamned wops cuttin' us out..'. Sorry. I understand the anger you got, but I won't hate for the sake of hate. I won't let them put me down..but I ain't screwin' my life lightly. There's billions of them, and only a few of us yet.""

Apparently from the confusion in Batwing's eyes, the words don't have any translation in his language. Still, the thought is there, to most of the extent. ""I don't hate for the sake of hating, though."" he points out. ""I hate for what they are and what they do."" One of the few haters who admits to truly hating. Whether that's good or bad, you make the call. ""If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be in this situation, or this hellhole."" A pause. ""The city. Not the house."" Oh, like that's better?

Kyrie shakes her head slightly, taking the time to work on her steak some more while she tries to come up with a response. ""Look,"" she says finally, wiping her mouth on her wrist. ""I dunno where you're from, dude..but it really ain't that bad. I mean..yeah, there's some morons out there I'd love to put some bullets in, but not /every/ flatscanner hates mutants. Some of them are even tryin' to make sure we don't get shafted by the ones who do hate us..."" she frowns, eyebrows drawing together as she searches for words. ""I just..I don't want to see things turn into a war. Fighting is fun, yeah..for people like me..but there's a lot of good folks out there, shouldn't get hurt if they don't have to be.""

""It wouldn't need to _be_ war."" Batwing mumbles around a mouthful, perhaps not intending to be heard clearly, ""if they knew where they stood."" He pauses in the eating to clear his mouth before saying more, this time making sure the words are clear. ""You do what you want. Not going to stop you. But I'll do what I want. And I want to be back where I belong."" He hesitates, fork nearly to his mouth. ""At least a job beating them up is better than working as their slave or something."" he finally says, before resuming the eating.

Kyrie finishes her steak, and starts working on the other potato, pausing to have another shot of whiskey and swallow of beer. The second shot goes down far more smoothly than the first, and she leans back comfortably, and shrugs. ""I ain't nobody's slave,"" her voice is flat, eyes empty. ""I decide when and where to fight. They pay me to fight, damned straight. They want the priviledge of seeing me fight, then they can pay for it. They want to watch me kick the shit out of someone, then they open their wallets."" A cold chuckle follows another swallow of beer. ""Look..the way I see it, I got where I am on my own two feet. I don't owe nobody nothin'. Not mutants, not humans. I ain't goin' out of my way to hurt no-one that doesn't set themselves in my way.."" she hesitates, the rest of what you said sinking in. ""Where /is/ home?""

""Nowhere. It got destroyed."" Yeah, yeah. Right out of a science fiction novel, I know. But from the harsh darkening of Batwing's features, he means it. No Krypton jokes, please. ""Haven. A world where the humans know where the mutants stand. They're-... they were, the rulers there."" His eyes grow a little wistful, another bit of the steak caught midway, before his features darken and he goes back to eating with a vengeance. Chew. He's mulling over your words, really. ""You still work for them."" he decides, ""but more like you're their boss than they're yours. I gotcha."" It might not be exactly how things are, but that makes a lot more sense to him,and apparently raises your standing in his mind.

Kyrie frowns, untangling your words until they make sense in her mind. ""You..you're one of them crystal babies I've heard of.."" she says finally. ""No wonder..."" she bites the rest of what she was going to say off. ""I'm sorry 'bout your home..that..sucks. I guess..I can understand why you're so mad."" She frowns slightly, trying to work out her words. ""I dunno, Bats,"" she says quietly. ""I don't want to see mutants treated like shit just for being what they are, but I don't wanna see that for anybody. I just..I just wanna live my life, and let them live theirs, so long as they'll let me.""

Batwing grinds down harder on the bite in his mouth. ""You don't _get_ it. They're the type of creature-... never mind. Not worth the telling. You don't care about this shit, I don't care about this shit."" He lies. He cares. But he's sensing that the argument is just not going to go any further than this. And by God, he's not going to get himself chased out of somewhere to eat, get a drink, and sleep for a night. ""Comes down to it, I still don't like them, won't like them, don't have to like them."" And that, as they say, is that. ""... Crystal Baby?"" Suddenly, that part of what you said tweaks in his mind, and Batwing arches his eyebrows up. ""What do you mean?""

Kyrie shakes her head vehemently. ""Hell no..I'm /not/ telling you to be buddies with them. Dude.. I'm still trying to figure out what I think about all of this.."" she sighs, rubbing her forehead. ""I know I ain't the brightest bulb on the block, but whatever I -do- think, I gotta think it myself, not let someone else decide it.."" she fills her shot glass again, and tips the bottle your way, looking up at you questioningly. She nods at your question, settling back with her drink. ""You're the first one I've met, but I've heard of others. Lemme guess..just before you showed up here, you touched some weird crystal, right? I guess there's folks like that poppin' up all over the place. Nobody is real sure what the crystal is, or why it's bringing people here. It just is..""

Batwing shakes his head. ""Nope. You guessed wrong, there. I was in a place called Madripoor. Looking for someone. Relative of Rancor's. It's hard to explain. Anyway, next thing I know, something's taking a pot-shot at my back, and-..."" His words fall off as he looks thoughtful. ""Wait. That could'a been what hit me in the back. Wasn't sure what it was, but out of nowhere, something hit me, and the next thing I knew, I was introducing my skull to a water pipe."" You should'a seen the lump. Hell, it's probably _still_ there. ""Huh. So there's someone, or something, throwing crystals around and dragging people here?""

Kyrie tosses back her shot, and curls her legs up under her, reaching into a pocket for her cigarettes. ""I dunno. Everybody who's had a story had it a different way. Some people got hit with them..like what you said. Others stumbled across them and tried to pick them up."" She chuckles. ""I kinda thought it was just some..story people were making up..but you..you obviously aren't just yankin' my chain.""

Yeah. Bats _is_ a little 'out of town', compared to some of these folks, isn't he? ""I don't got a reason to."" he says sincerely. ""I figured one of the folks down there had pulled me from the top of the city into underneath the city. But after flying around all day, I can tell you: this sure ain't Madripoor."" Plate cleaned in another bite or two, Batwing reaches to pour himself another shot of Jack. ""I can tell you for _sure_ that this isn't where I'm from."" Hell, it's not even _when_ he's from. That part hasn't fully sunk in, yet, other than how anachronistic everything here is.

Kyrie pushes herself away from the table, her stomach much more content now that it's filled, and begins picking up the plates and silverware, leaving the booze and glasses. ""Madripoor?"" she asks quietly. ""What's that?"" She takes a moment to run the dishes into the kitchen, and returns, pouring herself another drink. ""Well, like I said..from what I heard, there's a lot of people in the same boat. Lots of them are mutants, but not all of them. I ain't heard of none of them finding a way back, but.. well, good luck with it.""

Batwing shrugs his shoulders a little. ""A city, or an island, or something. Couldn't tell you for sure. But I can tell you that we went there looking for a guy called Logan. It's a really long story. I dunno if I could tell it all. Probably bore the hell out of you. But let's just say he means a lot to us."" He studies the glass of Jack from a couple different angles. ""Anyway, I'm not too worried about getting back. I mean, nothing to go back to. And if I got dragged her by a crystal, I figure the others will, too."" He then tips his head, shooting back the shot.

Kyrie finishes her beer, nodding for a moment. ""I ain't heard of no Logan, but I'll keep my ears open."" She frowns. ""Who are these others? This is a big place..could make it difficult to find 'em if they do show up..I hear lots of stuff on the fight circuit..I can prolly keep on the lookout for any news of 'em if you want.' she feels..not pity for this stranger, but a kind of empathy. He's about as lost as she is, if in a different way. Alone.

Batwing picks up the beer, resuming the half-draped sprawl on the couch, one arm dangling off the armrest where the rest of him leans. ""Logan, or Wolverine."" he says. ""He's the one we went to Madripoor to look for. Then there's Rancor. She's the leader of the Nine..."" Although the words sort of filter off there, for a minute. ""Six, now."" he finally says. ""Don't know if names'll help, but I can throw them out of you think they would.""

Picking up her beer, Kyrie slings herself comfortably enough in one corner, peering up at you while she sips at the bitter brew. ""Might. Dunno. If nothing else, I can spread word I'm lookin' for people carrying those handles.."" She sits up a bit. ""Can't promise nothin', Bats, but if I can help ya, I will.""

Batwing nods. ""Rancor, Blockade, Mindscan, Shaddo, and Side-Step. Those are the names to go looking for. Might also find a guy called Bear."" His lips thin a little. ""Him, I don't care much about."" he mutters somewhat darkly. A little chip on the shoulder, there. Beer gets another drink. ""Wish I could draw. I'd show you what they looked like. You really can't miss 'em.""

Kyrie tucks the names away in her head. She's gotten good at that. Remembering things, since she can't write them down. ""That would be cool,"" she agrees, emptying her beer and standing up. ""I could prolly find somebody who could do it for ya, if ya want..you want 'nother one?"" She tips the empty bottle towards you. ""Or anything else, long as I'm up?""

Batwing polishes his own off. ""Only if you don't mind me taking the couch for the night. I'm not about to fly drunk."" The empty bottle is set down on the table again as he lets his dangling hand drift to and fro in an idly thoughtful gesture. ""If you've got someone, then yeah. Or someone who can read minds. Be even easier."" He talks about it as though it were a part of life. Then again, with a friend called 'Mindscan', it's likely that it is. ""Anyway, faces'd be easier than names.""

Returning from the kitchen with two fresh bottles, Kyrie shakes her head. ""Got a spare room you're welcome too. Don't never get used anyways..might as well let you take it. Lot more comfortable than the couch. She tosses the bottle towards you, indicating the guest room with a quick jerk of her head. ""Beds already made up. Bathrooms over there if you want a shower. Towels and stuff in there already. Just help yourself to whatever you need..""

At least Batwing doesn't have to worry about finding a place for a bit. ""Thanks."" he says as he snags the bottle. ""Worth considering once I'm done this bottle."" And done getting thoroughly drunk. His head shakes as he cracks the bottle. ""How do I pay you back?"" His question sounds pretty much straightforward, intended to mean exactly what it sounded like: an offer of repayment for services rendered.

Kyrie actually looks surprised at this. In a way she'd been treating Bats like one of her old stoner friends. He needed a place to crash, and she had one. ""Nothin',"" she says after a minute. ""You ain't takin' up space I need, and you don't eat nothin' compared to me. Don't worry about it."" Fumbling the top off of her own bottle, she takes a long drink. ""Sides..kinda nice havin' somebody around tonight. Get sick of listening to my own voice bounce off the walls after a while.""

Batwing upends the bottle, downing a few good gulps of it. Fine then. He can deal with this. ""Alright."" he says once he stops for breath, wiping his mouth with the back of one hand. ""Your choice. I'm not going to push. I need the place, anyway."" Perhaps he doesn't recognize the 'outnumbered' comments from people, but he _does_ recognize that one mutant, several thousand people, is not good odds. Particularly when that one mutant is used to working in a group. ""So. Your work. How's it work, anyway?"" Now that he's reminded himself that you work for _you_ and not _them_, it makes it easier to think about. And more worth the curiosity.

Flopping back down in her corner, Kyrie leans her head against the wall, gazing blearily over at you. ""Well, depends. Some of my fights are legal fights. More boxing matches than anything else. Those they advertise in most gyms, so I just keep my eyes open, and go sign up for them. The illegal matches are harder. The better you get known, the more you hear about them. Me, I've been doing them for a little over a year now, so I'm pretty much a regular. You make more at those, but the risks are worse too..""

Batwing isn't bothered by 'legal' and 'illegal'. Human laws. They don't apply to him. Although he does look at you with a rather uncomprehending look at the comments about worse. ""Wait."" he says, rubbing his forehead as though to try and clear his mind. ""Risks? Risks, fighting humans? I saw how you moved in the park. I don't think you'd have any risks there. Are you fighting mutants?"" Apparently, the boy's still having trouble with the thought of 'holding back'.

Kyrie chuckles quietly, tilting the bottle to her lips again, before looking back at you. ""Look, I'm -good-, but..even I get tired, and even I make mistakes. The people you fight in the underground matches, they're damned good, even for humans. And sometimes..they do a free-for-all. I can find myself fighting two, three, four other people at the same time. I'm fast, sure..but I have to be careful not to go /too/ fast, or do anything to weird. It's not like I come out of these without getting knocked around.""</lj-cut"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Hello up there..."">The park is quiet, and dim. Cool with the evening air. Kyrie's favorite time of day, when the shadows cover most of the paths, and she doesn't have to dodge screaming kids and boomboxes. She jogs down the path, feeling the sweet burn in her muscles, her lungs just beginning to ache, and wonders for the thousandth time if maybe she shouldn't give up the smokes. Maybe. Maybe tomorrow. Glancing around, she grins as she sees that no-one is out there, and leaps to the top of one of the park benches without missing a step, crossing the back of it in two long steps, and then back on the path, without missing a beat, her laughter trailing behind her.

The night air feels good as it strokes through Batwing's hair, soothing the hurt of both his head and pride as he darts through the evening's shadow. He's already seeing what Marrow means about the humans overrunning the place. From the time he first took to the air until now, he's seen nothing that resembled a mutant, other than the woman, and nothing that resembled a place for those mutants to gather. He's becoming more and more annoyed as the flight continues, more than ready to go about slapping someone around for the sheer reason of being able to _do_ it. And look. Someone who's all alone in the Sheep Meadow. Smiling ferally, he begins a slow, downward spiral, watching the tiny thing move, and preparing to move in for the kill. At least he can feel better about himself, then.

Running beneath a low-hanging branch, Kyrie jumps, grabbing for it, and swinging herself up, landing lightly on the limb, laughing as she stands, looking around the park. With a long chortle of pure glee, she jumps, landing on the palms of her hands, and pushing off again, leaping back to her feet. It's a rare thing for her, to be able to be this free with her abilities. Usually she's holding herself back so hard it feels like she's going in slow motion. Not tonight though. Not with the park so empty...

Humans don't move like that. Batwing might not know humans well, but he knows them well enough to know that they don't move like that. He's almost disappointed that he can't mangle one to help his mood. But then again, he's also rather delighted once he sees that yes, there _are_ mutants up here. They just blend in. The poor things. The spiral turns from hunting to lazy, gliding down in a ripple of shadow across the grass.

The girl seems to sense the movement before she really sees it, spinning to a stop and turning in a slow circle, until she pinpoints the focus of the shadow. Her eyes widen in delight as she watches him turning spirals in the air. Standing there, she watches, and waits, hands thrust deep into her pockets. Part of her wants to continue the run, but she's more curious about the flyer.

Batwing expertly shifts and alters his flight until he's brought himself to just over the girl, pulling up and hovering, the fanned spread of wing along back and leg seeming to grab and hold the air, hanging him there almost as though he were standing on something. ""You're a mutant."" is the very first words out of his mouth, expression relieved, relaxed, and friendly enough. He's not smiling yet, unsure as to what _sort_ of mutant she might be, but willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Laughing, Kryie looks up at him, hands cocked on her hips. ""Bingo, you got it in one,"" she says, still chuckling. ""Course, from where I'm standing, so are you."" She glances around the park quickly, not nervously, just..habit. ""Looks like we've got the park to ourselves tonight. Thankfully.""

Oh, gee. Is it that obvious? What was the first clue? ""Thankfully?"" Batwing asks rather puzzledly, looking up and down the Sheep's Meadow without a trace of fear. Then back at Kyrie again. ""You're not afraid of the humans too, are you?"" He doesn't sound like he's jeering or anything. Just curious. And maybe a little pitying. ""And yeah. I am. The name's Batwing.""

Shaking her head, Kyrie cocks a gaze at him, her eyes dancing with amusement. ""Afraid? Hell no! I could knock any damned one of them halfway across the street and dance in their ribs if I wanted too. But damn I get sick of being looked at like I'm a freak. It's nice to be able to be out here, be myself..without any friggin' flatscanners starin me down.""

Batwing tilts his head at the language, unaffected by the strong words, but obviously having a little trouble following some of it. Particularly, ""Flatscanner?"" He's never heard the term, apparently. ""And why bother being worried if they stare at you? They're just humans, after all. Something like being worried about rats staring at you funny, you know.""

Running her fingers through her short hair, Kyrie grins. ""Flatscanner. Normal. Human. Not one of us, ya know? And-- like I said, it just creeps me out. I'm not scared of them, but I hate being looked at like a zoo animal. So..I keep myself to myself."" She shrugs, bending over backwards to brush her fingertips across the ground. She pulls herself back upright, almost dancing in place, unable to keep still. ""So..anyhow..I'm Kyrie.."" she says, looking up at him expectantly.

Batwing isn't bothered by the activity level. He's lived around Rancor. He's used to it. ""Kyrie."" he repeats. ""Is that your name? Or is that the name they gave you?"" There seems to be quite the difference for him. ""And I'm Batwing."" Hand is offered, even as the flaps fold a little, dropping him lightly to the ground in front of her. ""And just remember, they're only staring because they're jealous."" Yeah, sure. It makes him sound like a self-help book, but he's being honest. ""After all, they're useless, we're Gods."" And there's more humor to those words, meant, apparently, to be comparison rather than literal.

Tilting her head, she takes the hand, shaking it with a firm grip. Her hands are well calloused, though in unusual places. The sorts of places a gunslinger, and a fighter have callouses. ""Gods, huh?"" she chuckles. ""Well, dunno if I want to be a goddess, I'll settle for -rich- and -powerful-."" Batwing. What in the hell kind of name is.. ""What do you mean, ""they""? Kyrie is my real name. Nobody ever gave me anything else, though I'll likely pick up something in the ring eventually.""

""You're already powerful. Why bother with rich? That's for _them_."" Batwing says solemnly. Then, considering, he tips his head. ""Ring?"" He's _pretty_ sure he knows what she means, but he's learned not to assume. ""The name they gave you. The humans did. Or were your parents both mutants?"" Yes, quite the envy there if they were.

Kyrie shakes her head slowly, drooping a bit at the mention of her parents. ""Nah..they're both flatscanners,"" she says dully. """"Ring..I fight. For money. They don't know I'm a mutant though. I'd never get a match if they knew."" She shrugs slightly. ""And hell, money is a good thing, you know? I hate starving.""

Batwing completely mis-reads that droop. ""I'm sorry."" he says solemnly. ""I pity you. At least you got to be the lucky one, though."" Carefully, his arms cross over one another, resting across his chest as he inspects Kyrie like something... foreign. Not disgusting, but like something that he totally, _utterly_ can't understand. ""They don't know? They think you're... a flatscanner?"" He likes that word. He's stealing it for use of his own, Kyrie. ""Why wouldn't you get a match?"" Although the sickening feeling of what she _does_ is just heavy in his mind. She actually... works... for *humans*?! He can't even keep the disgust out of his eyes at the thought, and he hasn't even asked it out loud!

Kyrie frowns. ""Because I'm -fighting- humans. They'd think it was cheating. If I could find a place where mutants fought mutants..hell that would be awesome.."" she pauses dreamily. ""To be able to fight without holding back..damn.."" she shivers. ""So yeah, they think I'm a flatscanner. 'Sokay, still lets me make money, and get a bit of my own back. Even holding myself back..I'm better than any of them. I kick their /asses/.""

""You _work_. For _humans_."" Yes, _now_ Batwing can say what was in mind, even though she's already confirmed it. ""Why bother? Why not just take what you need from them?"" He's not sure whether to let himself be pitying or disgusted, right now. Although he is completely, utterly uncomprehending. ""Why bother holding back? it's not like they're important enough to bother with. Just show them what you can do. Make it a _real_ fight."" His grin is amused, in a rather... unnerving way.

Kyrie eyes him, hearing the disgust in his voice. ""I work for -me-. I go to the fights, sign myself in, and take the money when I'm done. My winnings."" She shrugs. ""Because I want to be able to continue to eat, without having cops looking for me all over the place. Because it lets me do what I'm good at."" She frowns, turning away. ""Christ..you're as bad as they are..looking at me like I'm a freak. Why in the hell am I trying to explain myself to you?""

Batwing's voice drops, low, harsh, and angry. ""You... take... that... back."" he says, very slowly, through hard-gritted teeth. If his eyes could glow like Marrow's, they would be. ""I'll let you do a lot of things, but I will _not_ let you compare me to a _normal_ in any way, shape, or form. Now take that back."" And from the way one fist balls, he's not being facetious, either.

And she keeps on walking. ""You treated me like a freak. The same way they do. You don't like the comparison..."" And now she stops, turning to face him, her face set and angry. ""Then don't /act/ like them.""

She's walking more than just away. She's also walking a very thin line with the aggressive mutant. It's all he can do to keep from simply hurling a bolt at her back, then turning and leaving. He holds back, though. Barely. _Very_ barely. The shimmer of energy could show just _how_ barely. ""I don't treat you like a freak."" he says, voice slow and measured, if not so patently near-explosion. ""I treat you like a _mutant_. Which is better than _they_ would _ever_ do.""

Staring him down, Kyrie walks towards him slowly, step by step. ""Is that so?"" she asks quietly. ""Then why in the hell are you questioning me like a mental patient. How come you look at me and I feel like a bug on a slide?"" One brow cocks up as she stares up at him, her lips pressed tightly together, muscles coiling beneath her skin.

""Because you're a *mutant*."" says Batwing, as though that should mean everything. The bio-energy still shimmers intensely across his hand as he throws the fingers out over the park, as though indicating something that just isn't there. ""You're better than they are, but you're working for them! They're nothing. You're everything. I don't understand how you can lower yourself to deal with... with... with *insects* in that way.""

Frowning, Kyrie spins around, starting to walk away, before she stops again. ""Look,"" she says quietly. ""I don't know who you are..or where you're from, but you..you just don't get it.."" she stops, her stomach growling audibly. ""Dammit! Look..you hungry?"" She frowns again, eyeing him hesitantly.

Batwing snaps his fingers shut angrily around the energy, dispelling it in a snap-surge down his arm. The change in conversation apparently appeased him. He's assuming it means that she's agreeing. Or at least willing to talk more elsewhere. He can deal with that. And besides... ""Yeah."" he says. ""Yeah, I guess I am."" He hadn't realized it until just this moment, really. But he hasn't eaten all day.

Sighing, Kyrie nods, indicating you should follow with a jerk of her thumb. ""Okay..I'm starving. If you want, we can go to my place..I'll try and explain why I do what I do..and I'll listen to what you've got to say, if you can manage to say it without making me feel dumb. Fair enough?"" She turns and begins to walk away, not watching to see if he's following.

Batwing does follow, feet leaving the ground in a jump, soaring along behind her willingly. ""I'm willing."" he agrees as he does this, the flight effortless and smooth. ""And maybe you can explain things better than that Morlock could.""

Kyrie glances up at him, her gaze frankly envious. To fly.... she sighs, leading the way out of the park. 'I'll try..though I'll be damned if I know what a Morlock is.."" and with that, she takes him out of the park, and down the road. Not a usual thing for her, taking people home, but..meeting a mutant in the park..that isn't a usual thing either.

Batwing doesn't drop to the ground until they've arrived, giving Kyrie plenty of time to go at her full speed if she wants to. He can keep up, after all. He also wasn't saying much in the entire trip, not at all bothered if he got stares from other people. Mind you, if Kyrie had asked, he would have circled off and followed from either further up, or further back. ""Comfortable. Nice place."" he says. ""The neighborhood could use some fumigation, though.""

Kyrie chuckles, entering the code in the keypad by the door. A moment later, the lock clicks, and she swings the door open. ""Maybe,"" she says with a chuckle. ""But I like the neighbors. They mind their own business, and the cops hardly even bother coming through here anymore. They know we own it."" She flips a light switch as she steps inside, illuminating the room. ""So..whatcha want? I'm having steak.""

Batwing looks relieved that at least the names for food are familiar. At the moment they are, anyhow. ""Whatever you're making."" he says, non-committally. ""I'm not a picky eater."" The room gets circled a moment, as he gets a look at the furniture and the decor. ""You live alone in here?"" That's not unfathomable to him. It sounds more like an idle curiosity than anything.

Kyrie glances back over her shoulder as she walks into the kitchen. ""Yeah, it's all mine."" She sounds proud of the fact, and why shouldn't she be. Coming from a one bedroom trailor on a dirt patch..this is one helluva step up for her. There's the sound of pans clattering in the kitchen, beeps from a microwave, and soon the sounds of steaks sizzling, the smell of the meat cooking, and potatos, fills the air. ""How many potatos?"" she calls back out.

Batwing calls back, ""One, for now. I need more, I'll ask."" The furniture gets a slightly displeased look, but then, this is someone else's place. He can't afford to be picky. Just as long as she doesn't give him odd looks for the almost reclining position he takes on the couch, settling into something that could almost be called cheesecake, upper body half-draped against the armrest, legs pulled up to curl comfortably. Disadvantages of having wings. Furniture just wasn't made for it.</lj-cut>"

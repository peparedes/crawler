the stylist gave me an ultimatum: halle berry hair or 90's prom hair and hair relaxation.

i'm no halle berry, but i had my prom in the 90's and i've had my hair relaxed before.

i sat for 3 hours (finished 2 chapters of my book) and watched the assistant painstakingly iron every section of my hair.

i'm quite happy with the results, so i gave a generous (too much, now that i think about it) tip. though it remains to be seen, they promised me i can wash-and-go with my new hair, and i wouldn't have to treat my hair until a year from now.

yay! i hope it goes well :)"

last week, i shared the commute with a lady who'd been shopping for a fire extinguisher.

we took a sharp turn from c5 to kalayaan avenue. as the lady was asleep (try carrying a fire extinguisher from the shop to the stop), her knees unclamped and the tank fell sideways onto my foot.

owww. and i have a scratch where the nozzle fell.

lesson learned: surely a fire extinguisher brought into a public vehicle by a fellow commuter is a threat? could have been more alert and:

""It Cannot Be Said for Certain"" by Kay Ryan

    It cannot be
    said for certain
    that imagining
    a pattern is
    self-flattery.
    Our acts could
    matter. At some
    unfathomed distance
    the random
    could condense
    to something -- say
    a fork -- against
    the velvet dark.
    The silver shiver
    that we get from
    time to time
    somewhere adding
    up to silver. The
    vacancies we suffer
    the necessary black
    between the tines.

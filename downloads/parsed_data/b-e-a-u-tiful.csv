&nbsp;
taylor tiff alison & court- man oh man it sucks losing all four of ur best friends @ once. but i guess i didn't exactly lose you guys because we are gonna be this way FOREVER. i just wish we could hang out more. but you guys better come visit me! i love you soooo much & promise me we won't ever not be best friends! you four are the best friends ever.

&nbsp;
catie- omg you are like my freaking sister. i love you tonssss. we've had really good times & i can't wait for you to come visit me. you better not change ur plans. haha you are so awesome, you know i love ya i can tell you ANYTHING and we always better be as close as we are.
&nbsp;
bo- i know you don't usually read these but i guess someone might tell you about it. but i just wanted you to know how much i love ya (like my brother of course).. you hav always been like my best friend. there is never any reason for me not to be able to tell you something & you've always been there for me so thank youuuu we better not ever lose touch.

&nbsp;
sarah pepper- ahhh i freaking love you. i know we weren't always like we are now, but lately we've gotten closer i think & i guess i just HAD to move when we did haha. you are like the sweetest person i know & i hope we will be friends forever!

&nbsp;
i saved the best for last.
&nbsp;
sean- i love you with all of my &hearts;! you are the greatest person i know. & i'm so glad we're together. i don't know. i feel so bad for the way things hav turned out & i don't know why you wanna stay with me even though i'm 400 miles away, but you do & i'm glad. i love you & miss you.

&nbsp;
i hope everyone has a lot of fun & maybe we can all stay in touch."

then we came back home and my mom calls and i hav to come home which was totally unexpected. and then i talk to them about my grades and me skipping a few times so now i'm in so much trouble and i'm scared out of my mind because the only options i hav is either going to another school, living with my dad, or making a/b honor roll in 3 weeks which is like totally impossible if you know what my grades are now. but i'm gonna try. so i pretty much can't do anything but go to homecoming if even that until next 9 weeks. it sucks i know. well yea i'm gonna go eat &lt;3</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT size=5>dang well&nbsp;i miss my tiff and court badly. i haven't gotten to hang out with them in a while. just whenever i started getting to chill with them all the time shit happens and i can't anymore for a while.&nbsp; oh well i guess that's just the way it is. school freakin starts in 2 days. god i'm not ready to go @ all. the only person that i know of in any of my classes is my best friend michael but that's all. and everyone has spanish like a period earlier than me. no lie.&nbsp;but after school everyday i can do whatever until like 4:30 5:00 so that's gonna be awesome. well anyways i guess i'm gonna go i'm tired i wanna go back to bed. &lt;3</FONT></P>

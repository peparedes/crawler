"event","Talk about an emo overload. Well guess what this is more of the same.

<lj-cut text=""lol"">Recently my internal barometer has been straying more and more towards the 'dangerous' side of the emo scale. I mean, I've had problems with low moods for years now, but lately I've been seriously considering if putting my head through the TV would be worth the amount of trouble I'd get in if it didn't either kill me or seriously incapacitate me. (Answer: hahaha hell no)

Just now, against my better judgment, I tried to tell my mum about this. It went a little better than I expected, because she had the plate-throwing tantrum (well, okay, the slapping-Xander-across-the-face-and-threatening-to-leave tantrum) and ten-minute rant about how ungrateful I am before I'd gotten further than 'I've been feeling pretty down lately'. So at least she can't hang <i>that</i> over me. She has enough proof that she's mentally stronger than me. Pretty sure she's not speaking to me now anyway, so w/e. 

I have literally nobody to talk to about this. Counselling was okay, I guess. I loved my counsellor, but ultimately there was no point to the whole exercise. We just talked about nothing for 45 minutes a week. I'm still a lazy fatass who's terrified of doing things. I think if I could get over the last part I could do something about the other stuff, but I don't know how. 

lol if someone I knew IRL ever found this LJ (which admittedly wouldn't be hard) and told my mother, I would be in so much trouble. I'd be dead before I hit the ground. So, just in case: <big><b>YOU'RE RIGHT, MUM. I KNOW YOU ARE. I JUST SUCK, OKAY? GOOD.</b></big></lj-cut>

I feel better (albeit guilty and embarrassed) for writing this out. So in other, non-whiny news... My birthday was nice. The 1966 Batman movie is the greatest thing ever put to film."

"event","Really, I am hugely lucky. Not in a gambling sense, of course. I suck at that. But I could be in a much worse position than I am now. I mean, if I were anyone else, coming out of school with barely any qualifications, a terrible attendance record and various nagging illnesses, I would be absolutely unemployable, and I would be fucked. 

But I'm not. See, we have a long-running family business, which I've been exposed to for literally all of my life. (Shoe repairs, if you're interested.) And in a few days, we are going to start work on a new shop in the same town as the one we have now (that's nothing- at the height of his career my grandad had shops in eight towns!) as a kind of ...off-shoot, shall we say, and a place to help ease the workload. 

And I own it. Seriously, my name's on the lease and everything. 

To be honest, I wasn't really pleased when he was talking about it at first. I figured it would be more hassle than I needed and he would never get around to actually BUYING somewhere anyway. But he really did, and now I'm thinking this could actually be really good. For at least a year, I'm going to be a business-owner. I'm even excited! We've been looking through one of the books of things we can sell and I love it all already. (Surprisingly, <strike>normal people</strike> people who aren't involved think it's dull. Maybe I don't because I've known and loved this business all my life?)

I really think I could do this. Even if it eventually falls through, it's experience, and I'm honestly loving the work I do at Shelter (turns out I have a thing for physical work. I think it's the instant gratification) so I do have other avenues open. Maybe I could even move out one day. 

Of course, my depressive side is coming through. The foreboding feeling that stops me from making any long-term plans is slowly creeping up and that little voice that constantly mutters <i>you're going to suck at this, how can you not fail at anything you do?</i> is getting louder.  Hopefully I'll be able to keep myself happy until my next counselling session, where I can at least ask her advice. Three days of cheerfulness- how hard can it be?

(Jeez, I hope this doesn't sound like bragging. Really, it's not. You don't know how much everyday life worries me- this is a new and exciting feeling.)"

"event","Guess where I went today! :D

We don't really go very far these days, due to money, so I booked tickets to London months ago as a kind of joint birthday treat for like everyone else in my family. And, unlike last year's fiasco, the journey there went really well! The weather decided to defy the forecast and be absolutely beautiful, the Natural History Museum's only gotten better in the last 13 years, and my timing is unconsciously AWESOME, because we came out from the Piccadilly Underground station to get some food...

And wandered straight into the London Pride parade. <lj-cut text=""Cut for London fangirling."">I didn't even know it was happening. (I know the Pride event where I live is in August, and I'm going to that, so I figured the rest of Britain would be about the same.) How fucking cool is that? I made everyone stay there for at least half an hour while me and Xander cheered and blew whistles and stuff, and Ash sort of stood there with a really uncomfortable look on his face. Oh, to be twelve... Yeah, I need to be down there again next year. I will walk to London if necessary. I mean, how many times do you get to run straight down the middle of a London street to get hi-fives from a guy dressed as a peacock?

Anyway, we went to the same restaurant I went to last year, because I remembered it being nice, and as it turned out it had gotten even better. Honestly, I had the best meal of my little shortarsed life, the service was fantastic, AND it was cheaper than any of the restaurants around here. It's ruined me for the local food, but oh god it was worth it. Anyway, we wandered down from there kind of looking for Trafalgar Square and found ourselves in St James' Park, which I am mentioning because I got to stroke some pelicans that were hanging around. The feathers are really soft. Then one got kind of pissed at me because I was leaning over a little to see if this thing on its beak was an injury or a growth, so it snapped at me and then turned around and sulked with its head between its wings. From there we got to Buckingham Palace, which is huge and cool-looking, but the guy right in front of the gates working on the drains and the guy who drove his Vauxhall Corsa right through the courtyard kind of broke the spell a little. And there was this plastic bag hurtling around in there, and on every lap it got closer to the guards. I wonder if it eventually hit one? XD</lj-cut>

There is a point to all this babble, I swear. I'm building up to something.

<lj-cut text=""It seems I have a lot to say."">Anyway from there we walked down to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, although we were running out of time at this point so we just looked at that and Westminster Abbey, then Mum wanted to see Tower Bridge so we hopped onto a District Line train and headed down there, because we figured it was only a few stops from St Pancras (or St Pancreas, as Mum called it) where we changed to King's Cross. So yeah, the Bridge is beautiful, and all in all, we've had once of those one-in-a-million days that you remember all your life. 

However, this wouldn't be a story about my family without just a little fail. So, guess what we did? Yep, we missed our train home. Which was the last train following that particular route for the whole night. Thankfully we were able to board a train taking us to a few stations away from home, and all the rail staff were very helpful and kind (we've met some wonderful people today) so we got home at around the same time we would have done anyway.

Today has been one of those days that just makes you love life. I'm overjoyed that I got to see the Pride parade, but even if we'd missed that I think we'd have had a fantastic day. Seriously, though, I think my face nearly broke from grinning. And I have bruises on my shoulders from carrying a really, really heavy backpack all day, and my feet hurt from walking what I swear was at least five miles (I could totally live in London. It's a very good place to not drive in) and and and this has been one of the best days ever."

"event","Every day I make less sense. I can't handle things with stripes because they move in my peripheral vision. I've had to give my quilt to my brother because the flames on it flickered and bothered me. Lately other things have been moving, like my door and the radiators. From my position at the computer, I can see one of my speakers' wires. The way it contrasts with the wall is hugely distracting. 

I've been zoning out a lot, and otherwise managing to get into situations where people are talking and I can't concentrate on any of them because my brain can't keep up. I'm guessing this is the Epilim, which I am also blaming for the return of my headaches. I guess I can have either headaches or epilepsy, but hey, one's better than both, right? I also swing between feeling relatively okay and feeling absolutely awful fairly frequently, but that's nothing new. 

I think I fail at counselling. First time I went, he asked about my medical history and my family history. I hadn't even finished the story of my health when he interrupted me with ""You do know what this is about, right? We're not interested in 'going back into your childhood', we're here to help you get a hold of yourself and move on."" Hey, you asked, man. Not my fault it took 45 minutes to get to where I am today. Anyway, he said they'd write with another appointment date and ...well, they haven't. Maybe they think I don't need it? I wish I did have a hold of myself.

Also the other day we were walking and I got chest pains and breathlessness and then my lips went all grey, which has never happened before. I think I'll be having that angiogram after all. \o/ My uncle says you get to see the screen, which is good because I like to watch. The inside of the human body is so cool.

And hey, it's summer. Maybe I can make some headway on this not-being-a-fatass thing I have planned. It's harder than it was, because the Epilim 'weightgainlol' side-effect has hit me hard. But I like being outside when it's sunny. 

This post is so disjointed. Most of me has been lately. I'm okay, though. I didn't intend for this to be so long. I should really get to bed. So, I'm fine. How are you? :D"

They won't find anything, of course. They never do. I'm a huge collection of symptoms. All of my tests say the same thing- slightly abnormal, but nobody knows how or why. Actually, as much as I hate that stupid jerking thing I do, I hope it happens, because I dislike the way they've phrased the possible epilepsy thing. 

Also I think my staples are coming out. I'm not sure and I won't have the opportunity to find out for a while, because Hull have rescheduled my post-surgery checkup so many times it is now in <b>May</b>. Well done, guys. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, though, as the aftercare was basically ""Can you walk yet? Awesome! Bye now. Try not to break anything."" Seriously, they left an old lady in the toilets for like half an hour. I love nurses, but these ones sucked. 

Also also, I think I'm going to be having counselling. As it turns out, my standards of happiness are kind of different from everyone else's. :B

I don't know exactly how long because my memory is terrible about these things) and she's always been fine around her. Sometime in the past couple of weeks, however, she has developed a fear of the cat scratching her, to the point of refusing to go up the stairs if Mirabelle is asleep at the top of them. I swear to God, there is no reason for this sudden terror. Mirabelle has never scratched her, hissed at her or even looked at her funny. So WTF?
The best part of all this is that Lex has also abandoned her bedroom (for reasons known only to her), only ever going inside it to play music at unreasonably loud levels. Guess who's started hanging out in her place? (She always looks so <i>comfortable</i>, too. Awww.)
Damn moody little kid. I can't wait until she hits puberty. Ohwaityesican. (I swear to god Ashley gets PMS. I know he's a boy, but you should see him some days.)

Also, Xander is becoming quite the little football star. He got Man of The Match in his league game today- actually, he's got it a few times, but today I'm posting for some reason. I'm so proud. 

Also <i>also</i>, holy shit is my LJ emo or what? I'm so much happier than this in real life! D: 
I <i>was</i> pretty miserable when I was younger (what with the whole mysterious illness that nobody really believed I wasn't making up) but I can't remember ever being this stuck in a dark pit of darkness!

Actually, I know nearly dying did a lot for my outlook on life. <lj-cut text=""I'm gonna talk about my illness now! A LOT. Cut because I love you. :D""> I don't even know why, because I didn't realise I nearly died until quite a bit later- seriously, I was either semi-conscious, hallucinating, vomiting or all ""hay u guys look at that light bulb theres snooker on TV yay do you think they'll let me out soon or am I gonna die lol j/k :B"" and my family were being told to prepare for the worst. (This remains hilarious to me, because it was my life in the balance and I'm a sick fuck that way.) 

BUT ANYWAY I've never had a sense of 'Oh God, I nearly died' because it never felt like I was dying while I was in hospital. Maybe I'd have been a bit more worried if anyone had ever mentioned to me how much trouble I was in, but the main problem I had was that the catering people were pissed at me for not eating. (I vomited so much my stomach ran out of things to puke (including yellow bile) so it gave me green bile. It was so awesome. Dark green and I've just remembered normal people don't like hearing about that.)
Actually, no I wouldn't have been worried. I can look back and measure my recovery by how much I cared about things- near the end of my stay I got upset to the point of tears by being moved (I didn't want to be in the middle of a ward) but the toilet in G ward had insects (possibly silverfish? I don't know) crawling around on the floor and I was all :D :D :D ""Hi little buggies! Let's be friends LOL"" about them. 

What does rather bother me is how bad I got with the doctors just passing it off as normal. Seriously, it was pure luck that got me diagnosed- they ultrasounded (it's a word now) my stomach to prove that I was FINE, and I should just GO HOME ALREADY AND STOP BUGGING US, GOD, and the lady doing it went a bit too high, and BAM- fluid on the lungs! (""...Are you aware you have pneunomia?"" is my favourite sentence ever.) And then of course they scanned my heart, and my left ventricle was so big my valves had started bursting (I made <i>so many</i> 'and the Grinch's small heart grew THREE SIZES that day' jokes, you have no idea), and everyone slapped their foreheads and went ""Oh, that's why!"" (And the fluid? Was blood leaking from the burst valves in my heart, which are still kind of leaking today.)
 But guys, my pulse was over twice what it should have been, I'd been vomiting constantly for three weeks (nobody's sure why, but considering how close I was to death I think it was my stomach either shutting down or holding up a huge warning sign), and my breathlessness (once merely choking me while I was lying down) had gotten so bad I couldn't even walk up the stairs without collapsing. I spent nearly a month CRAWLING up the stairs, and spending my nights watching Bagpuss and throwing up waiting for the sun to rise so I could go to the doctor and be told that I was fine, seriously go away and stop bothering us with your stupid panic attacks. 
 Turned out they weren't listening to my heartbeat and breathing correctly- the second a specialist did it they had the medical students round to learn from me within the hour. (""If you listen at the bottom of the lungs, you can hear the fluid swishing around, preventing proper breathing, and also, if you look here at the artery- tilt your head a little more please, Adrienne- you can see that it's protruding for 3cm more than it should. This is a sign of sinus tachycardia brought on by heart failure- in this case dilated cardiomyopathy."" I'm educational!)
 Actually, when you look back on scans taken over a year before that, when I was in for high blood pressure, you can see that my heart is already a bit bigger than it should be. Still barely within the normal range, but big. I FORGIVE YOU, NHS. YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO ME SINCE THEN. </lj-cut>

This post has gotten away from me! Anyway, I don't know if it's a coincidence or just because I felt so much better, but ever since I was taken into hospital I've been a much more lighthearted person. I remember walking down the corridors in hospital (when I was well enough to be let out alone) and just smiling at everyone because I felt so happy, and the inner cheerfulness has stuck with me since then. I do get down quite a bit, but all in all I'm happy in myself. So looking back at my 'OMG MY LIFE IS PAIN' posts from a few years ago is really quite embarrassing. XD (God, I was so much more 'grown-up' back then. Maybe that's why I'm so much happier- robots and toys and comics!)

I don't want to get a new LJ, though, and going the 'DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING' route seems drastic. Maybe I'll just lock everything. LIKE ANYONE CARES."

I got a PSP! With Silent Hill Origins, which so far is looking pretty damn cool (although I don't have a memory stick, so I can't obsessively save like I usually do). I also got all of Jeremy Brett's run of Sherlock Holmes, a 'Best of Rainbow' DVD (I love that my family knows what a <i>child</i> I am- seriously, I got Transformers bedsheets for Christmas) and Clarkson's Supercar Showdown. My birthday is conveniently placed in the middle of the January sales, so most of this stuff was like 75% off. XD

So, this year I'm hopefully going to get sorted out. My heart's doing well, my head's getting better (as is my arse) so I just have to get everything else sorted out and then I can ...get a job, maybe? Go back to school? I dunno. Do something, at least. I'll figure it out, I guess."

I loved it to tiny little pieces. It just made me happy. I can see why people might dislike it, but I'm not really a Potterhead and I've never been one for theories, so I have no reason to be disappointed. On several occasions, in fact, I found myself hugging the book out of sheer joy.

One of our neighbours had to have a tumour removed from behind her eyes.
Mum's best friend's three month old baby had a stroke, which has affected half of his brain. 
Another friend's nephew died in a Motocross accident, the day before he got his exam results (he passed them all).
One of Xander and Lex's best friends died of a brain tumour. He was five. I'm probably going to his funeral. It's going to be horrific. 

Me and Mum aren't so bad. My hair's falling out a bit. I'm very confused about school. Hopefully the apocalypse will wait until after Saturday, because my uncle is getting married then.

I get to have an MRI scan of my heart. The last one I had was of my kidneys, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I couldn't breathe properly for the whole time, and I don't know if that was a panic attack brought on by the incredibly confined space or the beginning of the fluid in my lungs from the heart failure. This MRI is nearly three times as long as the last one and I'm going to be even further inside the tunnel, so I guess I'll find out. 

My evening beta-blocker dosage has been doubled. Only the evening one, mind, because it can cause dizziness and light-headedness at first and he'd rather I be in bed when that happens.

Hospital was okay. The nurses were <i>awesome</i>- every Thursday we ordered a takeaway and watched medical dramas, which was fun because of all the mocking of the dodgy medicine (and the lusting over Hugh Laurie). Some of the patients sucked, some were awesome. I started going insane over the last couple of days. Had they not let me out today, I would probably have gone anyway.

Hello, LJ. I've just spent the last three weeks in hospital with heart failure. I'm told that if it had been discovered any later I'd be dead by now. I probably shouldn't find this fact as awesome as I do. I've recovered quickly, though, and they've given me a day pass out because it's Xander's birthday today. (Little guy's seven- he got a snooker table. We're going to learn to play.)

I have fallen in love with House and Doctor Who, and decided on the music to have played at my cremation should this happen again. (Don't Stop Me Now and the Magic Roundabout theme- my funeral is going to aim to make everyone as uncomfortable as possible.)

I can't do stairs anymore, but at least I can walk now. I have to go back to hospital at the end of today, but hopefully I'll be out for good on Friday. I feel better than I have done in years. Um, that's about it."

<lj-cut text=""This is angsty. Probably incoherent and riddled with typos too. But if I can't talk about this to someone who won't say it's all because I'm lazy I think I'm going to explode."">I want to be able to continue my education without the migraines and the bowel problems (and the people who think I'm skiving because I can't bring myself to tell them what's actually wrong with me because I know I'd never hear the end of it but they won't settle for any other answer) and the hospitals and the degrading tests that probably aren't gonna happen for ages (because this is the NHS we're talking about) but are weighing on my mind already. 

I want teachers who can take my favourite topic within a subject and not make me bored of it (FUCK YOU, Nazi Germany teacher!) and while we're on the subject of her, I want teachers who can keep their student support sessions straight, and if they can't, to <i>not bitch at me when I don't come along to a session you said I shouldn't come to<i>! I want teachers that can fucking teach, that don't cause students to drop the subject because they're not learning anything from her (Believe me, we all feel the same way). 
I want teachers who don't think I'm an incompetent idiot for not being able to read a tape measure (don't you do the fucking facepalm motion at me, bitch. If I could transfer how I'm feeling onto you I would) on a day when I felt so bad nothing made sense to me (least of all tape measures with no indication of the things being measured on them), and even if they do, to at least help me when I've been away and not expect me to catch up from my friends- we're a class of eight and the only friend I've got there is a really crap teacher- 'What did we learn today?' 'Uh, rivers stuff.' is, believe it or not, very unhelpful to me. 
I want to not have to do 4 AS-Levels because it's too much and I can't handle the workload and the pressure and the teachers who apparently can't fathom that we have homework from our other 3 subjects and the enrichment thing that we <i>have</i> to do, fuck you very much Mr Wilkins.
I want a teacher that doesn't phrase questions as 'comprehension' questions and then, when giving us the right answers, tell us her *interpretation* of the first chapter of Wuthering Heights. I wish she understood how hard that makes it for me to hand in my thoughts- that by doing that, she's made me feel as though I'm the only one who hasn't understood what Bronte is trying to say. Thing is, as I found out later, nobody else in the class agreed with her interpretation. Which is good, because Lockwood really didn't give off a 'screaming queen' vibe to me. Also? Someone feeling sad is not a Gothic element. Seriously. The word 'no' is not a Gothic element. And you are NOT a motherfucking witch, and even if you are, I don't care. Spending the lesson in which we were supposed to learn how to identify Gothic elements trying to see Lee Jefferson's aura and hearing about the evil ghost in your house is NOT my idea of a productive lesson.

I want to be able to say something other than 'Fine' if someone asks how I am. I want to not freeze up when talking to a doctor because I don't want to whine and inconvenience them. I wish my mother didn't make me sound so melodramatic when she talks to doctors in my place. I want to not feel so guilty for 'making her ill' by bothering her. I want her to stop fucking saying that!

We've got important exams on a lot of stuff I don't get in January. I could cry. This is overwhelming me. It's too fast. I wouldn't be as screwed if we were examined in June, like every other fucker before us. But <i>no</i>. Psychology? I'm fine and I love it. Philip Larkin English? I'm pretty sure I'm fine and I love the material we're working with. Bismarck History? Well, we're not examined until June and I'm actually getting it, so I think I'll be okay. Plus? Good teacher. The kind where you learn without actually realising it until he does a recall at the start of the next lesson and you know all of the answers! 
Nazis and Geography? OH GOD I'm so fucked. We're not even having the Nazi exam until June, but there are 60-mark questions and we know nothing and we've got 1950s Britain to cover after this. </lj-cut>


I want to continue my education. I really do. Fuck, they even say you can take a year out and come back next year if you can't cope. I don't think I can cope. But I can't go back and do this next year. I'm not sure if Mum will even let me. She says that if I can't do it this year, chances are I won't be able to do it next year. She says that I need to just make myself get all this stuff, that I don't really want to do anything about this. But I'm holding out hope that by next September, my health problems will be on the way to being sorted and I'll be able to get up on any given morning without being in pain. I'm hoping that if I do go back and try it again, I'll understand it this time around. But I can't. I can't bring myself to quit because everyone is expecting stuff of me and this isn't part of it. 

I don't think I could stand the shame. I'm supposed to be smart. How can I admit that I'm not what I should be?"

Look at the top picture, of the Agama lizard. Isn't that the cutest thing ever? It's just such a little poser! Then check out the snakes. So. Very. Beautiful. 

<lj-cut text=""In which I apparently go insane and start reminiscing like a pensioner."">My grandad and my Uncle Costus were once nearly bitten by a blunt-nosed viper. They were poking it with a stick. They were poking it with a stick because, let's face it, they're both really really stupid. They knew it was poisonous, by the way. Apparently, they fended it off with the stick for a while- all well and good, right? Then it started crawling up it. So Costus panicked and sorta stood there until it had nearly reached his hand, then switched ends and threw the stick as far as he could. When I first heard that story, I remarked that anybody so stupid as to deliberately provoke a poisonous snake deserves to be bitten.

Another time, my extended family were having a get-together at Costus' house. My second cousin, Alexia (my sister is named for her), had just gotten both a kitten, and a new pram. She took the obvious course of action from a five-year-old's viewpoint- she stuck a doll's hat on the kitten and shoved it in the pram. 

Anyway, the kids are in the back garden, while the adults are in the front. So the adults are boozing, catching up on old times- the usual- when they hear a lot of noise coming from the back. Screaming, laughter, shouting, etc. Naturally, they go to check it out, assuming the kids are fighting. 

They are wrong. In the centre of the garden, there is a black whip snake. A bloody <i>big</i> one. Now, the lads are having a fine old time with it, throwing sticks and stones, making it so the snake couldn't escape even if it wanted to. It doesn't want to. Y'see, the whip snake likes to bite. It ain't poisonous, but damn does it bite. Somebody has neglected to tell the children this. But never fear! The (apparently) sensible adults are here!

 The adults panic, the kids panic, the snake is probably already panicking, and there is a mass migration inside. All done, right? Wrong! Which little girl has forgotten her feline friend? Yep, that's right. Guess also which little girl goes out to get it! Yep, that's right. Alexia, in the most amazing display of rank stupidity ever witnessed at a family gathering, goes <i>back outside</i>, nearly steps on the snake, gets the kitten from the other side of the garden, goes back across the garden, nearly steps on the snake <i>again</i>, and gets inside mere moments before the snake does.

How she has lived so long is so far beyond me I couldn't see it with the Hubble Space Telescope.</lj-cut>

Sadly, I doubt they were lying to me. Now, back to the creatures of Cyprus!

Lizards are one of the few animals I'm not scared of. Very little chance of me hurting them, and if I'm lucky they won't hurt me. For some reason, I'm much more frightened of hamsters than I am of snakes and lizards and other reptiles. This could pose a problem when Tom goes on holiday. *meep*

Oh, and it's my little sister Alexia's fourth birthday on the 27th. Pity I can't sing. No tonsils! Ha!

Must... get... other... movies... </ movie fangirl zombie>

OK, so I watched it with a huge grin on my face and laughed at most of the gore (except for the crotch-torn-out part. I hate groin injuries), but still. I am in love.

I think that maybe it was a bad idea to let my 5-year-old brother watch it with me, though. ...What?! He watched roughly three minutes of it, during which absolutely fuck-all Freddy related happened, turned to me and said ""It's that movie with the monster with the claws!"" And did the Freddy Krueger claw hand thing. Our Xander rocks. :-D

Weirdly, he only got scared towards the end, when he was convinced that the kid was gonna die. Perhaps this is because he missed the hospital scene with all the blood on the ceiling. All in all, it was a very entertaining movie.

Alexander is gonna turn out like me. I have created a monster. A really cute, really short monster with a speech impediment. Like what would happen if Frankenstein's monster bred with a Care Bear. Only Xander doesn't make you want to rip your own brain out and clease it of the horrible mental images. Why the hell am I still writing?

Now I can only hope that Robert (Ashley's 9-year-old friend) doesn't get nightmares. Because if he does it'll magically be all my fault.

"event","Yeek. Something happened today that I feel dreadful about, even though I had nothing to do with it.

<lj-cut text= ""Cut for length. And vitriol.""> Y'see, there's this girl who lives near my grandparents' house (though not for much longer, as Grandad is moving), who was rather close to my grandma. OK, OK, they adored each other. This girl, though she gets on my nerves a little, even I will freely admit is alright- considering that her family is absolute scum.

So today Jade comes up to the house, knocks on the door and suchlike. My grandad (who seems to think everybody should drop everything and comfort HIM, damnit. Nobody else has feelings. Nobody else is grieving for Grandma) answers it, to be greeted with a cheerful hello and a request after my grandma's wellbeing. 

That's right. He hadn't told her, because he didn't like the family. Never mind the fact that she idolised my grandma, never mind the fact that he'd already stamped on her heart by sacking her shortly after my grandma's health deteriorated. Never mind that Grandma would want her to be told. OH no, 'cause y'see, Grandad is king of the world. Everything revolves around what <i>he</i> wants. 
For example: He's staying here right now, and as he doesn't like my brothers, he cannot fathom that they should have nice things. Therefore, we are actually having to <i>hide</i> my littlest brothers Gamecube, despite the fact that it was a birthday present from a week ago.

As a matter of fact, there are a number of people that Grandma specifically asked to see before she died, that he refused to let anyone contact because <b><i>he doesn't like them.</i></b> Sometimes I hate him. Or the things he does, anyway. 

So anyway. She asked, he responded with something like 'She died nearly a month ago.' Jade screamed and ran away in tears. Poor girl. 

Jade, I know there is practically no possible way that you are reading this, but if you are then I am so unbelievably sorry. Really I am. I would have told you if I could. You didn't deserve to find out like this.

"event","<lj-cut> My grandma died at 4:40 this afternoon. I didn't find out until maybe two hours later. I wasn't there. I'm glad I wasn't there. I think. 

...I can't feel anything. I'm not really thinking about this right now. I don't know why. I know I should, because if I'm going to do anything as emotionally humiliating as grieving, I have to get it out of the way before it becomes inappropriate. Or even better, not do it at all. That way I don't have to bother leaning on someone for comfort that they're unwilling and embarrassed to give.

Mum's going to take me to see her at the Chapel of Rest. I think I want to go. I also get to choose a song to play at the funeral. A Michael Crawford song. I know that her favourite <strike>is</strike> was 'Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again', but do I really want to inflict that on my family? There's always the possibility someone could see it as some kind of sick joke, after all. 

The rest of the family is gutted. Poor Uncle Phil nearly passed out. I want Ken and Jan. Especially Jan. The coolest person in the world should be able to make it better.

I want to smash my hands on my keyboard. I want to break something. I want to hurt someone. I feel like I have too much energy in my arms and hands, but everywhere else, including my brain, is just numb. The fact that my period decided to ambush me ten minutes after I found out about Grandma can't be helping. Fucking bastard bodily function. It was <i>waiting</i> for this, I can tell.

How the fuck could she die so suddenly? She was sitting up and talking to us a couple of days ago! Sure, I've had to pull a few all-nighters, but she kept recovering! Why couldn't she make up her mind, damnit?! Why did she have to get my hopes up?

Oh fuck. It's just hit me again. This is <i>my</i> Grandma I'm talking about. <i>Mine</i>. And she's <i>dead</i>. Dead. And I'm never gonna speak to her ever again. Oh, fuck. Seeing her at the Chapel of Rest is going to kill me.

...I guess I was hoping that I'd never have to say goodbye. That she'd magically... not get better, but not die either, and I wouldn't have to worry about funeral arrangements, being the tower of strength in the family, and not ripping my brother's head off when he continues to talk like he's in Disneyland or something. </lj-cut>

I can't think of anything more to say, except...

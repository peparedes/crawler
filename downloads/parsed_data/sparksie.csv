"event","So I know that its been a really long long time since I last posted. I suppose I keep putting it off because there has been so much going on that I really dont know where to start. As of lately I have been doing alot of thinking and trying to take some formative steps to get my life in order.
  Things with Tommy have been well fluctuant....I can honestly say I have never loved someone so much, we are and have been talking in forever terms in awhile and I dunno I'm getting scared.I feel life has been throwing so many tests at us that it has made our relationship a little bumpy. Tommy has become a little rigid, ultra serious so driven to
ensure our future that it seems to keep him from enjoying our life now. He is obsessed with finances household work and has been naggy and nitpicking. Its really getting overwhelming.On top of whatever household duties I do I work and am looking for a better job.Its next to impossible for me to save money with my current job.....and we want to start saving for a house now and be buying one withing the nest year or so.lots of pressure.
 Whats more my mother has caused a little discord between us and in my life in general.My mom keeps sending letters about how I need to come home and stop playing house and it is really hurting Tommy's feelings and it has created alot of fights between us because he feels like my mom is disrespecting him and I'm not sticking up for him. Everyone I tell about this situation says "" so just tell her it bothers you"", not so easy.My mother for lack of a better word is an asshole.She is crazy nuerotic overbearing to the point of nearly being a stalker and she wont be told shit.So i dunno....my dad is no better.
   Well since I'm on the subject I'm completely fucked in the head with all the shit that I've found out about my family,As you well know I know that my father is not my real biological father.My parents have kept this a secret from me and as far as they know they still think I dont know...well I do.Whats more the guy who I think is my real dad is a real loser a career criminal and I found out last month that he is now spending the rest of his life in jail for I beleive rape with various aggravating factors.Real family legacy huh? To make matters worse I always had a feeling our move to Florida was more a flight than a move.My dad has an older daughter who he has not payed a cent for child support.I also recently found out that he has another child who is the result of an affair he had. Yes my dad cheated on my mother and a child resulted.My mom instead of leaving him decided to have my little brother and decided to flee here. So here I am smack in the middle of all this family shit...mind you my parents have no idea that I know any of this shit. My brother well I guess my half brother if you will has a brother and sister who he has no idea about and I feel at some point in his life he needs to know
,He isn't my any means a very mature child and I dont know how a 13 year old would handle this information.....but I really want all this multigenerational disfunction to stop with us. I have so many terrible habits because of my upbringing ,seriously shit that I prolly should see a shrink for.It hurts me and whats more it hurts my relationship with Tommy in alot of ways.He has this great big family that always throw barbeques and have family gatherings....now on a limited level I can handle this shit....but the larger the shindig the more freaked out I feel.I get sad, I feel embarassed and paranoid and defensive. I have never been apart of a loving normal family unit....its hard for me to be in a situation where everyone loves each other so much.I also dread people asking about my family.Sometimes I just want to shout "" My parents dont even like Tommy,they dont want him in my life and I hate them because they are ugly hateful motherfuckers!"" but then that might make me seem a tad bit crazy.Its bad and I obviously have some issues that need ironed out....but most importantly I need to confront my parents. You see abuse can take many forms and regardless of what ever particular type it is the best heaking takes place after confronting your abuser/s.I can't expect much in the way of understanding so I have to have some ammunition so my journay starts with they Michigan dept of vital statistics.

"event","I was looking at a bunch of old pictures of mine.Man i was in great shape.I wonder why i let myself go...I wonder why I let my mom call me fat and beleived it myself.i would totally kill to be in my old shape.College and stress and just general neglect has taken its toll on my body.i dont want to be a slave to this anymore and I just want to get back where i was..not any skinnier just at that comfortable place where I was a few crunches away fom video booty girl status.i guess it was just easy to let myself go because my mother would call me fat so much i beleived it.I kind of resigned myself to ""well fuck this I'm always going to be heavy""mindset.I look at some of my pictures and damn I was skinny , in some of them too skinny and back then i thought I was fat.Talk about distorted body image.Now ,my mom is white and I'm never going to be as small as her.i have curves and she is well....shaped like a little girl.I have a black woman's body and I can more than accept that....In fact I love my body,but I would love it more if it were a few pounds lighter....but it would be also great if my boobs stayed the same size.i'm almost a D and I think bigger is better.
 i really need to make a change,a permanent one instead of the seasonal crash diets and excessive exercise that helps me to lose 20 lbs but then i never have the drive to keep off.
I gotta get this baggage out of my head ,and off of my body....but perhaps maybe I shall weight until after my birthday. dont want to throw a cog into this diet with drinking binges so I'll just wait."

"event","I despise lying, I feel so riducuous that I'm twenty and I still have to make a concetrated effort to deceive my parents in order to do what i want to do.i suppose that almost everyone no matter how amazing their relationship with their parents have their secrets, tell their lies.Its just a matter of being who you want without having to wory abot people guilting you in or out of doing things.I've been lying to my parents for so long that it just comes naturally,its so easy, I'm so good at it, and I'm ever evolving.As a child i used lies as protection,as I got older they were exciting and now its just a means of being myself and staying under their radar.i dont get the same middle school thrill I did ,when I got away with things.Now I just get what I think are the begginings of anxiety attacks.I just cant even beleive that as an adult my parents force me to be so deceptive.Its nerve racking....especially because my 21st is coming up and I want things to be seamless and wonderful.I dont think thats unreasonable.

 I dont even know when all their conservative nonsense came up...its like all of a sudden it became this monster....control has always been a big issue with the both of them,and because I'm their child I'm sure they feel in so many ways that they own me.I hate that ""my daughter"" ""my son"" shit actually becomes so possesive.Admittedly i have a few control issues myself( gee I wonder where it all came from) but really I'm just touchy about time and certain details that no one else really cares about.I cant have kids, because i cant bear to think that I'd put them throgh all the bullshit I went through as a kid.I canno garuntee how I will be as a parent and I dont like gambling, I like negotiating because I can better determine the outcome....you cant negotiate kids....you also cant control all those tiny little variables that ultimately shape someones personality...and I think that is the biggest issue of all.
 From what I can understand my personality has changed very little from when I was a baby.My parents try to stifel me from doing normal thins that kid do, there is a very short list of things that they find acceptable.... I dont think clubbing is one of them, neither is drinking or going to parties.I certainly dont think that the things I do determine who i am as a person but what I like, and what makes me happy is.The more my parents oppose and control , the more it makes me realize that they just dont like who I am....and that is just sad,not for me but for them.I like who I am,in fact I fucking love who I am with a cockiness that is parelled by few.I think that what personality traits I have that remind both my parents of their youth,upsets them,makes them ashamed of the mistakes they have made,and wants to crush those traits within me.

sorry but....syke motha fuckas!I'll guess I'll just keep up with the lies huh;)"

 Alright I just needed a brief moment to be stupid.Things really aren't going all too badly, I'm just a little frustrated because I find that I have so little time for myself.School and work have definately put a spike in any and all social endeavors I could possibly hope to have.I'm pretty much launching myself into making plans for my twenty first....the biggest issue is deciding what friends to invite because obviously all of them will not be compatible ,but I'm thinking all of my regular people and perhaps a few co-workers and of coure anyone from St Augustine who wants to make the 5 hour trek over to watch me get tore up.
Oh and by th way I know that usually on my birthday I kind of cater to everyone and do something we can all enjoy,but this year we are going clubbing .
 I'm sure my schedule for this summer will open up though because the school is offering so few on-campus courses,I'll end up probably taking nearly all online....then perhaps i can go fulltime and make more bread....that could definately be a good thing."

"event","Steven im'ed me the other day, we had a farily pleasant conversation, i think the fact that his internship isn't what he thought it would be humbled him a little bit.Dont get me wrong he still has a big head, its just been deflated slightly.We talked a little bit about our relationship in relationship to john.
 I cant for the life of me understand why he would still talk to him considering all the horrible things he has done.I guess in some respects John is still enamored with Steve , and Steve can reap the benefits of still being friends with him.John took out a huge insurance policy on his life and named Steven the beneficiary.(this could very well be a lie)We spoke about that and last night, i had a dream I was on the policy.
 We agreed that we were definately better friends when it was just us.We did ave some really good times together.My favorite though was the time i randomly ran into him and we went to All stars and had a shot together.As we were leaving I found twenty bucks so I bought us both a pack of blacks.We sat outside wired as hell not knowing what to do.He's like ""you want to drive to Georgia?"" Thinking he was totally joking I say yes.So we get in the car and start driving.When we made it to downtown J_ville we tossed around the idea of going to a strip club.he refused to stop because he insisted that there would be rednecks there that would hit on me and he didn't want to fight.I said that they would probably be looking at the strippers.We drove forever until we got into this little military town in Georgia.We stood outside smoking and they beckoned us in....because you can smoke in resteraunts there.We sat there for hours talking to the waitress about random things.It was a great time.
 I had this dream last night that I was in jail.We had to go through a cafeteria line and put raw meat on a grill and if it wasn't done after a few seconds you hand to get back in line.It took forever to cook the food so none of the prisoners really got to eat.Then i dreamt i went to this tattoo studio and the girl artist was really horrible.She was one of the rockabilly girls and would only tattoo crap like dice and kittens.She was talking about how great her new tattoo was and it really sucked.It was a necklace that had like black dice on it and somehow she managed to get glitter in it.The guy that does my ink showed up ( but he was a midget) and i was trying to get an appoinment with him because i was scared the girl didn't clean her needles.She tatooed the way that like thai people do....the scary way.My next dream was that kanika and I and these two guys snuck out of town and stayed at a hotel in some downtown area.i hooked up with one of the guys and then everyone got all mad at me.WE left.Some girl came to my house to pick me up and I lost my i.d in her car.We stop at a smoke shop and I really wanted cloves so i was like having a panic attack looking for my i.d.It took me forever because I had al my old highschool and college id's and like baby pictures but i found it."

"event","<P>&nbsp;Yesterday I spent the vast majoirty of my time wasting away in the hair salon.Getting your hair relaxed is not a relaxing process in the least.Afterwards I went to the mall with Kanika and thenI stayed the night over at her house.</P>
<P>&nbsp;We have no clue as yet what to do for the fourth this year because Ian is in Russia and Frannie....well Frannie is off doing her thing so I think its safe to say that she will be out oof our usual goings on for awhile.It will be he first time in like three years that we all haven't done something on the fourth so it will beweird. Its not like we are all super patriots but it is an excuse to get out and do something although the weather is always sucky.Last year was the best even though Frannie flaked out.</P>
<P>Frannie is back with her boyfriend in Orlando. I would never get on her case about something like that just because Frannie is so wary and aloof, its futile to have a serious converstaion with her.She automatically shuts down.Its justhat I dont trust him or his little buddies.She got into massive debt when she was with him and drives like a maniac to and from Orlando just to see him for a few hours.This is the same boyfriend that let a pal of his break a gel tab into her mouth so she would go to sleep.....because things like that are funny to them.I cant force her to be responisble.Kanika says she just wants to ""live the life."" I guess I am inclined to agree but I cant help wanting to be protective.Frannie dosen't do well to hide her guilt so she just goes off the radar for a few weeks or a month and then calls us to do something in her usual spritely fashion.Tacky .It is her life though, I just want her to be careful.</P>"

HollisAction: sage?
Belthasar1: I don't remember who you are
Belthasar1: honestly
Belthasar1: I can't place you
Belthasar1: what's your name?
HollisAction: sparkle duh
Belthasar1: hahaha
Belthasar1: sparkle!
Belthasar1: pleasant surprise!
HollisAction: uh are you serious?
Belthasar1: not sarcastic
Belthasar1: yeah
Belthasar1: I like hearing from you
HollisAction: why?
Belthasar1: I'm really sorry about what I did
Belthasar1: because, sparkle, I told you I loved you
Belthasar1: I will always like you
Belthasar1: we spent too much time together for me not to think of you in pleasant terms
Belthasar1: You know
HollisAction: well i do beleive you are sorry and i was too pissed the last time we talked to be cool headed
Belthasar1: If I hadn't have gotten depressed, and if I hadn't have gotten shipped off to brainwashing land again, things could have been different
Belthasar1: I just got into USF!
Belthasar1: I'm living here in St. Petersburg now
HollisAction: thats good
HollisAction: look i mean i dont mean to sound harsh but i think things worked out for the best
HollisAction: i think it would have ended one way or another
Belthasar1: Life is better for me now than it's ever been in my life
Belthasar1: Yeah,
Belthasar1: I agree
HollisAction: but i've heard some rather unsellting things about you which i really dont intend to get into...
HollisAction: but i i said before
Belthasar1: Just because I feel too young to commit
HollisAction: i hope you make decent decisions with your life
Belthasar1: Oh hell yeah
Belthasar1: Things are better than ever!
Belthasar1: And I'm extremely capable of taking care of myself
Belthasar1: Oh man, it's like I'm just going to dominate the world!
Belthasar1: But what unsettling things could you have possibly found out about me?
Belthasar1: probably stories from emily
HollisAction: it really makes no difference
Belthasar1: busybodies love to revile other people
Belthasar1: and cast their judgements upon others
HollisAction: and why would they be stories, as it is i have just cause to have a little bit more faith in her than i would you presently
Belthasar1: stories are stories, stories I told to her and andy
Belthasar1: stories she told to you, I'm sure, in a rather horrified manner
Belthasar1: just tales from my life
Belthasar1: she should be more concerned about herself
Belthasar1: she has a lot of venom in her
HollisAction: what would make you think so
HollisAction: you haven't been back that long
HollisAction: thats kind of a sweeping assumption
Belthasar1: It's a fairly qualified statement
HollisAction: though i haven't seen emily about as long as I've seen you
HollisAction: how so?
Belthasar1: I'm sure if you did your own investigations yourself you would see what I am talking about
Belthasar1: and if not
Belthasar1: I could always be wrong
HollisAction: investigations into what.....i have nothing to do with any of them for a reason
HollisAction: its just not a part of my life i'm willing to go back into
Belthasar1: hahaha
Belthasar1: then why are you concerned about it?
HollisAction: im not it was just thoughts, i have concern fo most people that i involve in my lives
HollisAction: its a horrible flaw
Belthasar1: me too, naturally
Belthasar1: I feel like I love everyone
HollisAction: i dont feel like that
HollisAction: i just feel concern and thats it
HollisAction: emily has a higher regard in my mind because I have known her quite well
Belthasar1: ahh...
HollisAction: from what i can tell she has changed little
HollisAction: so i should think that you would understand my skeptisim of you under the circumstances
Belthasar1: Hahahahahaha
Belthasar1: I made no claims emily was lying
Belthasar1: I make no claims
Belthasar1: by stories I simply meant tales
Belthasar1: if you look in the dictionary
Belthasar1: there's nothing about the word ""story"" that implys deceit
HollisAction: the tone of the converstation implied it
Belthasar1: No, I think your own mental state interjected it
Belthasar1: you're putting your words in my mouth
Belthasar1: so in a way
Belthasar1: you're having a conversation with yourself
Belthasar1: with me present
Belthasar1: that's okay though, I meet many who are like that
Belthasar1: But you're different sparkle
Belthasar1: You used to be such a freed human being
Belthasar1: you used to be a hell of a lot happier
Belthasar1: or at least, lighter
Belthasar1: something happened to you
HollisAction: i was less serious then, I am more happy now
Belthasar1: really?
HollisAction: do you doubt it?yes of course i am.you may think that you have some knowledge of where I am at in my life.....but you wouldn't know enough to judge
Belthasar1: no, I do not doubt it
HollisAction: when i have conversations with people......in my crowd we are direct
HollisAction: leaving little room for doubt
Belthasar1: Only you, not me, has the right to answer that question, so I accept your answer as the truth
Belthasar1: I was merely prompting for an answer
HollisAction: I dont like the way you prod and assume, your pain and experience makes you no more knowledgable than you were before
Belthasar1: Prove it
Belthasar1: I think you're full of yourself, and full of shit, for that matter
HollisAction: i thin k you are scared and backed into a corner
HollisAction: why so defensive all of a sudden
Belthasar1: I am a direct person
Belthasar1: I leave little room for doubt
HollisAction: if you believe it then i wont argue
Belthasar1: That's you're prerogative
HollisAction: are you angry now?
Belthasar1: No, definitely not
Belthasar1: All I know is that 95% of the statements you have made to me today about what you think is going on with me have been absurdly incorrect
HollisAction: what statements are those
Belthasar1: HollisAction: I dont like the way you prod and assume, your pain and experience makes you no more knowledgable than you were before

Okay, number one, I did not prod or assume nothing. Prove I did, back up your rudeness, please

Number two, You're an idiot
Belthasar1: Is that clear enough?
Belthasar1: Oh, and number three, you started it
Belthasar1: All I wanted was to reminisque and talk as old aquaintances, but no
HollisAction: we weren't even having an argument for christs sake
HollisAction: im not the one doing the name calling or attacking
Belthasar1: You fuck it up
Belthasar1: Sure sparkle
HollisAction: sure what....
HollisAction: is that not true
Belthasar1: You're a fucking train wreck. Some wierd shit happened to you and now you're a batshit loonball with real problems
Belthasar1: How can I be any more honest than that?
HollisAction: lol wow defense mechanisms are a bitch huh
Belthasar1: Maybe I shouldn't hold back with people
Belthasar1: I would'nt take the low man's route of calling you a bitch yourself, but your antagonisms are infantile.
HollisAction: you know sage the truth is you came out ofthat institution worse than you went in....you will always be the selfish
HollisAction: little ingrate
HollisAction: that you always were
Belthasar1: keep it coming
Belthasar1: I want more
Belthasar1: nobody ever insults me
Belthasar1: I want to know what exactly the hell I am
Belthasar1: nobody cares about me enough to insult me
HollisAction: you ARE the crazy one and I hope you feel greatly justified in all your accusations towards me
HollisAction: you never knew me sage
Belthasar1: Whatever sparkle
Belthasar1: I knew you
HollisAction: beyond the physical you knew nothing
Belthasar1: I knew the shit out of you
Belthasar1: And frankly, I don't care
Belthasar1: I really don't
HollisAction: its alwasy the sick ones you are so self assured
Belthasar1: do whatever you want
Belthasar1: I'm just who I am
Belthasar1: I just call the shots as I see them, and do the best I can
Belthasar1: I think I'm a pretty great person
Belthasar1: I want to do the world a favor. I want to do people I meet on the street a favor
Belthasar1: I just want to help mankind
Belthasar1: I love other people,
Belthasar1: and I love their company
HollisAction: lets eee how long it takes before you have another break down you are not even in your right mind enough to have a decent conversation
Belthasar1: my dear
Belthasar1: I never had a break down
Belthasar1: I think you've had several yourself though
Belthasar1: which is the tragedy
Belthasar1: of this joke that hasn't dawned on you yet
Belthasar1: that you're fucking crazy
HollisAction: im having such a big laugh at your expense
Belthasar1: as hell
Belthasar1: Oh really? I don't remember giving you a laugh
Belthasar1: Did you steal a laugh from me?
Belthasar1: my expense... my expense...
Belthasar1: hmm...
Belthasar1: what have I expended?...
Belthasar1: my words?
Belthasar1: If so, thanks, it's a compliment
HollisAction: the effort of trying to make me feel bad
HollisAction: it wont work
Belthasar1: Sparkle I'm glad you feel good enough about yourself to say that
HollisAction: i dont have to strut around like I'm above people to justify my fuck ups
HollisAction: you WANT to believe I've had breakdowns
Belthasar1: As you want to believe I have?
Belthasar1: You villify me
HollisAction: what would you call going to an institution
HollisAction: a vacation?
Belthasar1: I would call that a recurring chemical imbalance... very different from a psychotic break
Belthasar1: If depression has something to do with selfish behavior... I've got no clue then how I'm being so selfish
HollisAction: you are so desperate to believe you are a good person......and that somehow I have a problem and you are so astute as to judge that from a computer
Belthasar1: Am I astute
Belthasar1: if you are saying that, thanks, but I don't think it's possible to think I'm that astute over the matter of this particular conversation...
HollisAction: i dont know what you are...other than what I can judge from your insane attacks
Belthasar1: I'm simply a defusive person
Belthasar1: Well 
Belthasar1: you have a point
Belthasar1: diffusion mixed with insane attacks
Belthasar1: like some kind of manic depression
Belthasar1: But you can connect the dots however you like
Belthasar1: We all do, whether we know it or not
HollisAction: others are not so lucky as to be an asshole and have a chemical imbalance to blame it on
HollisAction: nothing is ever you
Belthasar1: I know I seem to good to be true
Belthasar1: but I'm just that damn good!
Belthasar1: I-am-the-very-model-of-a-modern-major-general
HollisAction: does all this make you feel better
HollisAction: i hope so
Belthasar1: I'm getting a kick out of this myself
Belthasar1: You seem to tend to say things to people that hurt them emotionally
HollisAction: i can if it calls for it...i dont usually do so, even when people deserve it
Belthasar1: I understand, well, that's good
HollisAction: i wasn't the one who hurt you
HollisAction: remember that
Belthasar1: If it's just me than that probably means you still have healthy relationships with other people
Belthasar1: sparkle, I was selfish
Belthasar1: I was a selfish bastard
HollisAction: i am in a healthy
HollisAction: relationship
Belthasar1: although when you talk about my depression, a crippling disability, and my subsequent hospitalization as selfish acts
Belthasar1: You sort of give away your inherent batshit loonballness
Belthasar1: Which I have been referring to
Belthasar1: You seem to think I care what you think
Belthasar1: that is a big misassumption
HollisAction: i hope you live a full and happy life Sage, and though recently I've seen you passing I hope to never see you again
HollisAction: good luck
Belthasar1: Thanks
HollisAction: with yourself
Belthasar1: You too
Belthasar1: Thanks
Belthasar1: A lot
Belthasar1: If you ever change your mind
Belthasar1: I'll always talk with you
Belthasar1: even be your friend
Belthasar1: sincerely
Belthasar1: just go and remember that
Belthasar1: au revoir
HollisAction: wait a minute before i say anything else....what is there for me to change my mind about
Belthasar1: change your mind about never talking to me again, sometime during the next 70 or so odd years of your life, somewhere down the trail, if you do, I won't hate you or anything, I'll just be happy to see you again
Belthasar1: And I care about you
Belthasar1: I do want you to be happy and I do want.. you know
Belthasar1: I want you to get everything you've ever wanted, and live happily ever after, as I feel about all people, so don't think you're special
HollisAction: goodbye
Belthasar1: bye"

"event","<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#00cccc>So my parents have decided on a family vacation to Michigan.*cringe*This is definately going to make for a miserable time for me , but really funny stories to tell my friends.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>&nbsp;One of the reasons my parents moved to Florida from Michigan, was to get away from my dad's family.There was no real legitimate reason that I can discern, but I imagine it had a great deal to do with them both being crippled by paranoia.My dad's family probably shouldn't like us.We've done quite well in life , and my dad was always quick to shove it in their faces.Most of the big arguments that I can remember usually resulted in one of my aunts telling my dad that he ""wasn't Jesus Christ!""Its been 7 years since my parents have been to Grand Rapids.I have been back several times since we've moved, but alway by myself.At least when I'm alone I can see all of my friends and I can see the family members I want to see.I know I'm going to be forced to sit around and listen to gossip.I know that I am going to have to sit there and pretend like our lives are fucking perfect and we are the greatest success story a family could know..I know I'm going to get yelled at for not having a shit eating grin on my face.I can certainly garuntee you that I will get yelled at for my hair not being perfect and me not being dressed to the nines.Bit the biggest sure thing of all these, is that my parents just like on any and every family vacation, will get into a collosal argument.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>&nbsp;I dont think I've ever been on a family vacation that my parents haven't royally fucked up.I guess they enjoy spending thousands of dollars to be miserable for a few days.One particular incident stands out in my mind.My parents were quite partial to Disney family trips for a good while, especially the Magical Kingdom.I loathe the Magical Kingdom and quite frankly I find everything about it nauseating except for Pirates of the Carribean and the Haunted&nbsp; Mansion( not because of the movies).At any rate we trudged around the park forever until my paretsn launched into some ridiculous argument,probably about my mom's spending and then my dad threw all the money in the air and they continued to fight while I monitered my brother and gathered hundred dollar bills strewn on the ground.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00cccc>This is what I've come to expect in life</FONT></P>

Do Polly Pockets or Popples ring a bell? 
Big wheels and bicycles with streamers were the way to go. 
With your playschool record player you sang back up to Debbie Gibson. 
""Party like it's 1999"" seemed SO far away!! 
Can we say Trapper Keeper? 
""Can you tell you how to get to Sesame Street?""
You wanted to be on the American GLADIATORS!!!
You still have a crimper in your bathroom drawer.
If you remember singing Amy Grants ""Baby, Baby"".
You had more than one Star Wars action figure.
You loved your pink jeans and black stretch pants.
Big hoop earrings.
If you remember when roller blades were the new thing.
If you learned how to spell 'mouse' from the Mickey Mouse Club theme song.
You used to wear bright pink slip-ons and jelly shoes.
You used to compare your little brother to Ferguson. 
You were scared of the Gremlins.
You remember when Ren and Stimpy was a new show.
When MTV was all about Rock Hard videos and BIG hair
Pee Wee's Play House... 
Rainbow Brite. 
Bum bags. 
If you knew Alvin, Simon and Theodore, their song, and the colors they wore. 
If the A-Team was prime time viewing each week. 
If every colour you wore was in some fashion related to ""hot"" i.e. pink, green, or blue. 
If you remember the Challenger explosion. 
If you loved the Thundercats. 
Can we say: ""Hungry Hungry Hippos""? 
If you had a Glo-Worm.
The Snorks were a Saturday morning specialty.
Your stripey socks practically came up past your knees.
The Bernstein Bears was a new book. 
Apple Computers ran the schools and IBM was just getting its roots.
Looking cool involved a jean jacket, torn jeans, a t-shirt and very large sunglasses.


Children Of The Eighties 

We are the children of the Eighties. We are not the first ""lost generation"" nor today's lost generation; in fact, we think we know just where we stand - or are discovering it as was we go. 

We are the ones who played with Lego Building Blocks when they were just building blocks and gave Malibu Barbie crew cuts with safety scissors that never really cut. We collected Garbage Pail Kids and Cabbage Patch Kids and My Little Ponies and Hot Wheels and He-Man action figures and thought She-Ra looked just a little bit like I would when I was a woman. Big Wheels and bicycles with streamers were the way to go, and sidewalk chalk was all you needed to build a city. 

Imagination was the key. It made the Ewok Treehouse big enough for you to be Luke and the kitchen table and an old sheet dark enough to be a tent in the forest. Your world was the backyard and it was all you needed. With your pink portable tape player, Debbie Gibson sang back up to you and everyone wanted a skirt like the Material Girl and a glove like Michael Jackson's. 

Today, we are the ones who sing along with Bruce Springsteen and The Bangles perfectly and have no idea why. We recite lines with the Ghostbusters and still look to The Goonies for a great adventure. We flip through TV stations and stop at The A Team and Knight Rider and Fame and laugh with The Cosby Show and Family Ties and Punky Brewster and what you talkin' 'bout Willis? We hold strong affections for The Muppets and The Gummy Bears and why did they take the Smurfs off the air?
After school specials were only about cigarettes and step-families, the Polka Dot Door was nothing like Barney, and aren't the Power Rangers just Voltron reincarnated? We are the ones who still read Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, the Bobbsey Twins, Beverly Clearly and Judy Blume, Richard Scary and the Electric Company. 
Friendship bracelets were ties you couldn't break and friendship pins went on shoes - preferably hightop Velcro Reeboks and pegged jeans were in, as were Units belts and layered socks and jean jackets and jams and charm necklaces and side pony tails and just tails. Rave was a girl's best friend; braces with coloured rubber bands made you cool. The backdoor was always open and Mom served only red Kool-Aid to the neighborhood kids - never drank New Coke. 

Entertainment was cheap and lasted for hours. All you needed to be a princess was high heels and an apron; the Sit'n'Spin always made you dizzy but never made you stop; Pogoballs were dangerous weapons and Chinese Jump Ropes never failed to trip someone. In your Underoos you were Wonder Woman or Spider Man or R2D2 and in your treehouse you were king. 

In the Eighties, nothing was wrong. Did you know the president was shot? Star Wars was not only a movie. Did you ever play in a bomb shelter? Did you see the Challenger explode or feed the homeless man? 

We forgot Vietnam and watched Tiananman's Square on CNN and bought pieces of the Berlin Wall at the store. AIDS was not the number one killer in the United States. We didn't start the fire, Billy Joel. In the Eighties, we redefined the American Dream, and those years defined us. We are the generation in between strife and facing strife and not turning our backs. 

The Eighties may have made us idealistic, but it's that idealism that will push us and be passed on to our children - the first children of the twenty-first century. Never forget: We are the children of the Eighties."

"event","Annette I think its pretty safe to say you are taking shit a little bit too far.I mean are you really trying to convince me that I'm crazy or obessive or that I have some deep seeded hatred issues.Everything you say about me is a vast exaggeration of what little you think you know about me.Everytime you write something, you totally betray yourself.I am not so easy in that regard.
 I am way too confident to ever take any of the shit you say for anything more than a grain of salt.You need the constant justification,thats why you always have to ream me out on your little livejournal.You sure as hell aren't hurting me and its not likely that anyone you hang around knows me or could ever care about any of this.
 What is it that you lack,""closure""?Well I can give it to you if thats what you want.Is it the same thing with Kat, are you just curious?Do you wonder why I stopped being friends with you?Does it please you to discredit me only to yourself?
 With all this bullshit, what EXACTLY is your point?For once say something worth saying.Once I stopped being friends with you there was never,ever any conflict between you and I until I just so happened to get a livejournal.Considering the ONE mutual friend we had on the list I dont think its too difficult to figure out who started the nasty pathetic little comments on my livejournal.
 I understand ,I suppose why you would be curious about me.I am just confused as to why you need to twist things around or perhaps ,this has been going on for so long that maybe you beleive your little realities that you've created about me and probably a great deal of other things.
Always the hero,always the victim.Annette,I wash my hands of you.I suggest you do the same.
 If you really wish to speak to me in a civilized manner than you may....from now on if you wish to talk shit about me than I'd really enjoy it if you did it to my face.This computer bullshit it getting pretty tiresome."

 You never really do know what to say to insult me do you?You try so hard but at it really adds up to is a jumble of nonsensical ramblings.First of all saying I'm intelligent is hardly a blow, thanks infact.Hate keeping me back?Honey I'm in a private fucking college.Where are you? I think I'll do pretty damn well in life.""how far will you go if all your hate keeps you back""Do you hear yourself?That sounds like a fucking bootleg regurgitation of some cheesy fucking Star Wars movie line.Thanks Obi wan Annette, I'll follow your marvelous fucking advise on how not to be hateful.Gay,I'm gay now?You really ARE running out of ammo!You haven't even seen me in 2 god damn years.The idea of me being gay hasn't come up until now.If i was ,what possible difference would it even make anyways?Am I so shallow as to think that there is something wrong with being gay?Of course not, but you must be.How very bible thumper of you.I talk like a man?I haven't spoken to you for damn near six years , actually scratch that I said something to you senoir year: "" I wasn't talking to you."" The last time I checked,Annette, you were the one with the deep gutteral man voice.There is a defense machanism called projection,and I beleive,Annette, that you are in fact using it."

It was nice to get away, Kanika and I always have the most hilarious times, this time too despite the fact that there was no hashimotos(not hash or hashish).Its been awhile since I've hung out with anyone sober.Maybe I should not say that I dont want people to think that I'm an addict.I'm not dudes seriously.We went to Publix and spent an hour there just staring at people and what not.It was hilarious.Next day we went to the mall and got 3 bucks each for those  dumb surveys.Stoners if you wanna make a quick buck when you are broke and need to get stacked take a few friends to the mall and do a twenty minute survey.3 people garuntees you a dime at least.I used my 3 for Wendy's oh Christ it had been so long since I've had anything ""unlealthy.""Thanks Wendy's fo good food at great prices.Im such an asshole.
So I'm worried about Kanika's big time her acid reflux is real bad she couldn't eat yestrday , she couldn't keep anything down,It dosent help that she is stopping hashimotos .It kinda helped her to have an appetite and to keep food down."

"event","Tommorrow I leave for school.Its kind of sad to go.I suppose the hardest part is leaving my friends.I dont look forward to going back to having to interact with people who have no understanding of me at all.I suppose that is a bit selfish sounding but its quite true.I beleive what bothers me the most about the most of the people I deal with on a daily basis are so self serving. I am so unaccustomed to that.All of my friends here give so freely ,anything I have to give is theirs and vice versa. I get the distict feeling that any generosity shown to me is not without some ulterior motive.Why does everyone have to give to get?I'm seriously considering cutting off all but maybe 3 people.I came into school with the idea that I'd try to be a little bit more tolerant and patient with people. I think I've gone far beyond the call of duty.Now I'm going to do what it takes to keep myself sane and productive.Lets face it, I'm Sparkle, Im aggressive and I'm not afraid to walk all over people who would otherwise do the same to me. I know where my alligiences lie."

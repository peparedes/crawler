"event","I finally got the sugar cookies made. We found some corn-free powdered sugar at Trader Joe's (really wish we had one of those closer than 2 hours away.) I'm going over to a friend from church's house on Tuesday to help her with converting recipes since her son has several allergies, so I wanted to make cookies the kid could have too, which definitely upped the complexity. The kid is allergic to wheat, nuts, dairy and eggs. That plus my corn allergy and dye-free decision made the baking interesting to say the least. I had a recipe that had plenty of substitution ideas, and I know enough about all of the main allergens to know what to do, and we had the ingredients, it just led to a very crumbly dough. Subbing out milk is not typically an issue in recipes, and a chia seed egg actually works quite well, but between a corn allergy and dairy allergy, it meant no butter or butter substitute. The main butter substitute contains corn, and butter contains dairy. So I was left with oil, which does not work quite as well for cookies. It didn't help that that dough was initially very crumbly, so I kept adding oil and working with it and ended up adding a shade too much, which meant my perfectly cut shapes became unrecognizable when baked. But they still tasted good, and the icing tasted fine too, even with the natural food coloring. It was also good to know I can bake and compensate for a variety of allergens, though I'll be glad to have my butter to cook with for the second batch, as I think it will make it a lot easier (I was going a bit nuts when the cookies kept breaking before I could get them on the cookie sheet before figuring out to add more oil.)

The recipe made about 3 dozen cookies, and with it being egg free, I could actually eat the raw cookie dough for a change. :-) Plus we have plenty of cookies to keep some and give the rest away. One of the guys in my church group is gluten intolerant and hasn't had sugar cookies in years, so part of the second batch will go to him. I look forward to being able to hand him a container of cookies he can eat next Sunday, especially since his wife has apparently been teasing him with store bought sugar cookies lately (something common in families where only one person has an allergy, and I'm thankful Chris doesn't do that.)

The only issue I still have with the cookies is that the icing doesn't set. I think I've had that problem with other homemade icing using normal food coloring, so I don't think it's the dye, but I'm not really sure what to do about it either."

"event","Can't sleep. Since I starting writing this in my head as I was laying in bed, I figured I might as well get up and actually write it out. 

I went off bc as of the beginning of May. I found out it could be contributing to my reflux, which I was desperately trying to control without meds, and I never got a clear answer as to whether mine contained corn. Ever since then my body has decided from mid-cycle on it's going to have PMS. Apparently said decision is lasting more than just last month, hence the insomnia and overly reflective emotionalness. 

Twice today I spoke about music and my idea to use my music degree for small group lessons since it's likely the music programs around here will be decimated by the huge chunk of state funding the governor is taking away from the K-12 schools. It's an idea I've had since getting my music degree, just not one I had overly thought through. Now, despite my willingness to toss it out as a possible way to earn money from home, I feel even less qualified. I haven't picked up my trombone for more than a practice session or two once or twice a year since my Senior recital. Every time I do I'm reminded of all the ways my embouchure and playing is wrong, and I get frustrated, then busy, and the horn stays in its case for months at a time. For a while I was a little better with keyboard, but it's been the better part of a year for that even. Yet a part of me misses music so much - I just lack the confidence (and time) to pursue it. I peaked in college, and it's unlikely I'll ever get myself back to that point. And yet to get to that point I made myself want to quit music through the endless practice sessions and disappointing lessons. Being a music major was both the best and worst decision I ever made. It made me the best I could be, yet forever tinted my love of music. 

But not everything was bad. Tonight I thought about Willard HS band camp and the other sectional teachers I met there. I wondered what they were up to now, especially the amazing drummer/marimba player who I actually met up with again when I visited U of Toledo (his alma mater) when I was considering going there for law school. He had since gone on to seminary, and I lost track of him after moving to PA. I know the other two girls have since gotten married, one rather abruptly, but I know little more than that. Like so many people, they came into my life for a brief time, then left. For a while we kept in contact, but that faded. Even if I could find them on facebook or if they suddenly revived their xangas, we would be strangers to each other; band camp has long since passed, as has graduation, and we're each either still playing/teaching or doing something entirely different. 

Perhaps an even harder memory are the kids. My 6th grade drummers from student teaching, who could barely keep a steady beat the last time I saw them, have just graduated from high school. My high school kids, especially the Cedarville HS kids I worked with for over a year, are well into college or whatever paths they chose, and some have since even graduated from there. I have no idea where any of them are at, what they chose to do with their lives, and sometimes I wish I knew. Wish I knew if they stuck with band, what fields they chose to study after school, who they grew up to be. 

It's hard, keeping up with people, trying to do more than just stay in touch and rely on memories from a prior time in life. So much changes, even in a few months. I know I can't keep up with everyone, yet at times I still desire to try, or at least to know. I think that's why I have so many facebook friends (352 and counting, and all but a dozen or so are people I've known in real life-the ones I only know online are those I've had hours of online discussions with at some point), just to be able to check in on people and see what has happened with them. It's deceptive - you don't really know the person anymore - but it's more than nothing; it's at least some way of connecting and seeing a peek into their life. And there's always the possibility of reigniting the friendship, even if it's only a glimmer of one. 

It's been five or six years since most of us last made laps around Cedar Lake (a proposition more difficult to do now with the new Bible building.) So much has changed from our college years. Sometimes I miss it. Not the classes or the trying to get the best practice spot or especially not the juries each quarter/semester. But I miss the relationships. The staying up late chatting in our rooms, the walks around the lake at night, sitting on the benches having serious conversations, the sometimes literally bouncing off the walls in the hallway til someone told us to be quiet. Like so many good things I fondly remember (conveniently forgetting the hard parts), there are times that I mourn. Mourn that I didn't realize what I had then, didn't take it fully in, did not appreciate it as much as I should have. But sometimes I know I did treasure it, realizing that time was limited and it would pass; even so it does not stop the desire to go back, even for a moment. I miss you guys. 

That's not to say life isn't good, it's just different. Hard in a different way. But it's been a hard few years. Ever since leaving Cedarville my life has been turned upside down a number of times. Often by choices I've made, and some of those have not been good choices. Not everything has been a bad turning upside down, but everything has been challenging. Challenging in a way my memory tends to forget in time, such that my memory makes past events seem better, easier than they actually were. Before long law school will be a blip on the radar of my life, and the drudgery of studying for the bar exam will be overshadowed by the next big event. And I try to turn my focus to making friends with the people in my life now, and maintaining those of my closest friends from college such that past memories are not the only things we have to share. Not an easy task, especially when struggles are not so easily shared across wires and phone lines, and each of us has a life separate from the others. 

The local minor league baseball game must be over. I hear what sounds like thunder but isn't, so it must be fireworks. I've only heard it once before, when I was up this late desperately trying to write a paper required for graduation. That was over a month ago. It's crazy how fast time flies sometimes. 

And with that I'll end this rambly and somewhat depressing post. Not sure how many people even check LJ these days anyway."

"event","I've kinda forgotten about LJ in the busy-ness (I know that's technically spelled wrong but is clearer IMHO) that is life right now. So far this year we've attempted to buy a house and had that fall through due to termites in the primary supporting beam of the house, finally bought a house, moved to said house, found lots of large spiders in the basement of said house, had water come in the basement of said house shortly after moving in, dug a 6'x8'x2' pit and trench to the street to collect and disperse said water that would otherwise come into the basement, had a massive silver maple tree cut down b/c of said water (the diameter of the trunk was almost 4' and that wasn't the widest part) attempted to graduate in the top 25% of my class at law school (and failed, but with some reason), found out my dad lost his job earlier this year, was told mom was having heart surgery the week after I graduated and would likely lose her job, my dad found a job only to be out within the first week due to a staph infection that had him in the hospital during finals (my reason for not so good grades this semester which dropped my ranking), found out my mom's surgery was pushed to mid-June since Dad was virtually bedridden and he can't go back to work until at least August 1st, found out I'm allergic to both wheat and corn (and likely refined sugar, but that didn't come up on the first wave of testing), had to clean out almost everything from our kitchen despite having already been gluten free since it all had corn (or maltodextrin, detrose, distilled white vinegar or anything else derived from corn), completely changed my diet once again due to said limitations, crocheted five blanket/hat sets for friends at church having babies, (everything so far while trying to finish classes, my externship, and while writing a capstone paper explaining results of an empirical study so I could graduate), finally graduated from law school last weekend (yay!), ate out for the first time since the corn allergy (it was at a nice (though not too expensive) restaurant near Philly and the chef came out and volunteered to make anything I wanted), and came back home from vacation on Fri to find we had missed massive storms and a potential tornado - and were very thankful the only tree big enough to fall on our house had been cut down before we left because others were not so lucky. It has been an absolutely crazy first half of the year.

As of Tuesday I start my official bar exam preparation. I started a bit earlier b/c the official start time for the course was last Monday, and we were in a cabin w/o internet so I opted to do what I could before we left, then start the official stuff late and play catch-up. May not have been the best choice since I will likely be making a trip out to Ohio for my Mom's surgery in June. We're supposed to study 6-8 hours a day with the provided material (it's a course - law school doesn't teach you what you need to know for the bar exam so you have to take a $1400-3000 10-wk crash course to learn all the stuff the profs never taught you) and an addition 2-4 hours a day reviewing on your own to make sure you memorize all of it. The test itself is 2 days long. The first day is 300 multiple choice questions - 6 hours, in two parts, 150 questions per 3 hours - though the questions are all short paragraphs of facts so it takes 30+ seconds just to read the question. The second day is 6 essays plus a performance test - 2 essays plus the performance test in the morning 3 hours session, 4 essays in the afternoon block. The performance test is where the bar examiners will provide a small folder worth of case materials - could be anything you'd get in a legal setting - and will outline a specific task for you to do based on those materials, such as write a certain type of document to be filed or come up with an outline of the legal arguments to pursue in the case. Of course you only get an hour and half to read and digest everything, plus write out your answer. Needless to say, I will be glad when it's all over. The bar exam is the last week of July. 

Of course, come August I'm not sure what I'll be doing with my life. The bar exam results won't be out until October, and with the economy down, ""might-be"" attorneys generally aren't being hired. I have to pass the bar first. There are several options, though none of the standard ones are things I'd like to do. I am considering doing some crochet/sewing items and trying to sell them online, though who knows if that will make any sort of profit. At this point it's a ""wait and see"" since with the way things have been so far this year, who knows what will be going on at the time. It's driving me a little nuts not to know, but at the same time, not having it cemented means the thing I hope might work out still could (and no, I'm not being more specific than that at this point.)

Ok, this is long enough. Anything else I have to say can wait until another day."

"event","Ok, so upon more thought, and a gracious comment by Kelly, I decided to go ahead and do the online food blog, for now. <a href =""http://glutenfree2010.wordpress.com/"">http://glutenfree2010.wordpress.com/</a> I decided to go with something completely separate from every other blog I have, with the thought that this could actually become a helpful for the gluten-free community. I think I'll probably post all of our recipes there, so while the baking is probably more complicated than anyone here would want to deal with (having a dozen different flours and starches around is expensive) some of the other recipes might be good (like our quiche and chili recipes, which don't really take any special ingredients.) One word of caution is that gluten-free flours and starches don't substitute 1:1 for wheat flour in recipes. This is why I've mostly modified already gluten-free recipes rather than modifying ""normal"" recipes. I might tackle that later on, but for now I'm still learning exactly what combination of flours is good for which type of baking. If there's only a small amount of flour called for (under 1 cup) you could probably substitute all purpose flour for it, but overall I don't know enough to convert it exactly."

"event","So I've been obsessed with figuring out all the dos and don'ts for a gluten-free diet. The snow days have given me time to check out all the products I currently eat or our in our home. There's a lot of ""nos"" but actually not quite as many as I originally thought perhaps - the verdict is still out of a few products using vague ingredients that I originally labeled as ""no"" but might be ok. (the problem is while wheat has to be labeled by FDA regs, other sources of gluten don't have to be, i.e. barley, malt, oats, rye, and a lot of ingredients are derived from one of those latter sources but show up vaguely as ""natural/artifical flavors"" or ""food starch"", but you don't know if the individual product uses an acceptable source or an unacceptable source. A lot of times the internet has conflicting info as well, so I've started calling manufacturers or getting on their websites to find out. I have a Dr. appointment next week, and I'm going to have a whole slew of questions for her I think. 

Here's a video I came across explaining more about Celiac and how prevalent but undiagnosed it actually is. Apparently it can cause a significant number of chronic diseases and disorders. 
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLJSmJ0bMlk&gt;"">YouTube explanation</a> Here's a link to the University of Chicago site with information as well: <a href=""http://www.celiacdisease.net/celiac-disease-101"">Celiac</a>

I was happy to find that Wegmans, a local grocery chain typically considered more upscale, has a little marker on all of its store brand products that label if mainline products are gluten free. This is extremely helpful in buying things like marinades and dressings, since the ""gluten-free marketed"" products cost 2-3 times as much as a normal mainline product. And despite my initial concern b/c of the upscale nature of the store, the actual prices are comparable to the grocery stores I normally shop, so I guess I get to switch stores partly now. Chris found this morning in the pamphelet I picked up on Celiac (sitting in a rack with other phamphelets on various food allergies)that the store publishes a weekly set of recipes and makes sure one of them is Celiac friendly. I think the employees are all trained in food allergens too b/c when I mentioned Celiac or gluten-free, they all knew what I was talking about. So that was cool, and made my shopping experience much easier. Plus the store itself is just fun. It looks like a castle from the outside and inside has all sorts of random things, like a small model train that runs on a suspended track along the length of the store. 

I also found a heath foods store not too far away that carries all sorts of gluten-free things that are much harder to find, like soy sauce and teriyaki sauce (because the whole process to make them is different, it's not just substituting ingredients.) The health foods store actually had a baked goods section and sold gluten-free muffins and brownies and such, with a sign that said they would make to order cakes sufficient to deal with any food allergy, including Celiac, and had a folder with a list of the products in their store that are marked gluten free. Granted, the price is significantly more, but it's good to know I could go there to pick up rarer objects or even order a birthday cake."

"event","School starts today. The car's fixed so that's good. I didn't get too much sleep though - just fading in and out of consciousness with vague thoughts about what most of my profs will be like and what they'll expect from class and homework (one prof I had last fall, so I know what to expect from him.) Gone are the days when I was just excited about school starting. I think that lasted until last year with starting law school, so I guess I had my fair share. Now I just want to get this week over with so I can figure out how I'm gonna fit things in and what routines I'm going to try to get into. At least it's supposed to be a nice day outside, if only the school wasn't across from a truck stop until Jan (they are doing construction on the building and we get to move to the new facility in Jan. which will allow for leisurely strolls in historic downtown Carlisle during the afternoon breaks.)

So I guess it's back to the constant homework, constant feeling of falling behind, and never having enough time for everything. I guess I should see it as an opportunity to learn to handle lots of stress. At least this year I have Chris around to help with the cooking and cleaning so there's not as much pressure in that area, and I can talk to him in person while eating dinner and before bed instead of trying to IM when I should be doing hw. 

Ok, time to go get ready for technically my first day of school, fall 2009. My very first class being my hardest, yet most useful of the semester: Evidence (aka what you can and can't do in a trial, complete with memorizing the rulebook for the final.) It's a good slate of classes, and I'm excited to learn about them, just some of the casebooks aren't fun to read and left me confused when trying to do my first assignments, so that has me a bit concerned - some profs will go over the readings, some won't and I don't know what these profs will do. At least my most confusing class has several of my law school friends in it, so hopefully that will help. 

Ok, now it's really time to get off here, go eat breakfast, make coffee and get ready to go. (See, some things never change.) ;-)"

I tried to get my wedding pictures printed and had to jump through hoops and make multiple trips b/c of some PA law and photo people who don't understand what a copyright release means. Then I got a nail in my tire yesterday and panicked b/c I couldn't find any of my paperwork and the local dealer was saying they didn't want to honor the insurance. I've been stressed out all week and gotten nearly nothing on my to-do list done, and after this week there won't be time to do any of it. It's been a mess. 

Then today I finally got the main thing on my list done. I cleaned the office. Which considering that it had become our main storage area for miscellaneous papers and smaller items, this is a big deal. I technically still have two containers of things to go through, but that will wait until tomorrow when I also tackle the storage space for larger items and neaten up everything else. 

As I was taking bags of paper out to the recycle bin, I realized that having my car out of commission for two days was actually a blessing. I didn't have the pressure of trying to fit errands into everything else I was trying to do. Since errands had been a main source of stress this week (getting lost, taking wrong roads, having to make multiple trips due to one thing or another) being stuck at home actually should allow me to get caught up on everything else I had planned to do at the apt. 

Now I just hope the car is actually fixed tomorrow, or else more stress will ensue, seeing as how I now live a 20 min commute from school and there's no one I can catch a ride with and classes start Monday."

I think i may have issues with the bar exam. I just mentally ""check out"" after an hour or so of taking an exam. Maybe b/c standardized tests never have sections that go for much longer than an hour, and all my exams previous were under two hours. Today's final went the full 3, and while I made it and I think I did decently, I had to leave the room for a break about halfway through b/c I was just mentally gone. 

Now to take a nap and studying for the last one. It's going to be the longest and most intricate, but it's not difficult material for the most part and we get 5 handwritten pages plus a copy of the code half of the class is based on.

It wasn't just me, well, at least not being knocked on my rear. Most people thought both finals were difficult. I just got to a point on them where I gave up and was mentally done. Which won't help my grades, but does wonders for my sanity. Tomorrow's exam is supposed to be straightforward and an untypical law exam. Which intimidates most of the class, at least the over half of us who stayed to talk about this stuff for 2 hours longer, after the 2 hour review session. It's an open note exam, so it shouldn't be bad. But the if it's straightforward and simple like the prof says, then I'm wondering how it will take 3 hours to write when she doesn't want us analyzing things. It boggles my mind. 

On the bright side, two more exams and first year is over. At this point I'm just ready to not have something school-related hanging over my head and to have a stress-free weekend with Chris, even if it is supposed to rain all weekend...again. It's May now, the rain was supposed to happen last month. :-P

Chris and I started a new Sunday school/small group this past Sunday. It was supposed to be a young adult (23-39 yr olds) group, but it turns out they were meshing the young couples group and the young adult group so it ended up being a bunch of young married couples our age. That worked out well since I had wanted to go to the couples group primarily to meet other couples we could hang out with, but Chris didn't want to have marriage topics all the time like a lot of those groups have. So instead we get the peer group with more of a Bible study rather than a ""how to improve your marriage"" deal - they just finished a study of Acts, this week began a comparative religions section where various couples are researching a cult, sect, or denomination and teaching the class. It reminds me of Religion and Culture, and I actually pulled that book out when we got back to my apt and gave it to Chris to read over the week. It's nice when things you learn in college find their way back into life, even if it's still in a semi-academic setting. 

Even more exciting was that some of the people in the group play Settlers of Catan and Cities and Knights! I had yet to find *anyone* who had even heard of Settlers of Catan, now there are two other couples who play, which is perfect for a nice 6 player game. Between the 6 of us we also have the main games and expansions. :-) So hopefully an evening of Settlers will be in the picture soon. It was fun how I found out - the leader had a facebook message about hand and foot, which I haven't played since the last time we all played, so I asked him about it and then about Settlers. Now if only I can actually remember how to play hand and foot enough to teach Chris..."

"event","I just found out that a prof at my school is doing research on an area of law I kinda wanted to specialize in - collaborative practice in public interest family law. I could potentially be a research assistant for her on this project, as she's been short on time to make any progress. This could lead to lots of good things, not just potential law review article topics, but major publication and possibly creating a program in the Harrisburg area, since the research would be along the lines of what obstacles there are to the programs and how to overcome them. Makes me happy that there is someone else around with this oddball idea who sees it as legitimate. :-) So maybe having class from 6-9p tonight wasn't as bad as I'd thought it would be. 

Yes, I'm a law geek. 

For the record, collaborative practice is when both sides have an attorney and everyone sits around the table to negotiate a solution to the legal issue. It's most commonly used in divorce cases. The difficulties are due to the high emotions of the people involved, but the idea is for the attorneys to have full disclosure and represent their parties interest but work for a compromise that would be doable for both sides, making it more like a big problem solving session(s) than confrontational. The biggest issue is that due to the inherent nature of how the system works, if the practice falls through, then neither of the attorneys involved in collaborative practice can take the case to litigation. This is a difficulty for legal services clients because legal services attorneys are difficult to come by so to have to find two other attorneys if the collaborative practice falls through isn't feasible currently. To not have the clause where the attorneys step away if it goes to litigation means that one party can attempt to have the upper hand b/c you have to prep for litigation which means there wouldn't be full disclosure and the whole thing snowballs apart. So, it's generally accepted that collaborative practice, while a nice, low-cost option,  just isn't realistic in public interest settings. I don't buy that, so it's exciting to have the possibility of collaborating with a professor who also doesn't buy it and maybe be able to create workable solutions. :-) :-) :-)

"event","Life consists of it's normal craziness right now. Tons of work for school, not much time for much else but making time to hang out with Chris on the weekends. The past few weekends have been fun and memorable in their own rights. I got Chris a little Weber camping grill for Christmas and we decided to start making use of it since I have a picnic table on the patio outside my apt and a window from the kitchen to be able to watch it in the kitchen. It's the one good thing about my otherwise very annoying apartment. So the first weekend we made salmon and also shrimp shishkobs, both of which turned out ok, but not great. The next week I drove out to Harrisburg and we went to a park to grill since it was supposed to be nicer out and park grilling is easier so I've been told. Chris grilled chicken that day. Thing was, it was fine when the sun was on our backs and the fire from the grill keeping us warm, but when the sun went behind clouds, 40 degrees suddenly got cold. The chicken came out great though and the block of snow Chris put on the grill to get the fire to go out struck me as funny. I tried to take a picture, but my camera decided it didn't want to work. :-( I'm thinking about getting a new one, but I don't really have the money now and because my camera isn't very good I've gotten out of the habit of taking pictures, so I don't know if I'd use a new one enough to justify the expenditure. 

Anyway, last weekend was Valentine's Day and the main ""special"" thing we did was grill steaks and sweet potatoes out on the grill. Also in celebration of Valentine's Day, Chris offered to go swing dancing as his gift to me. I had fun, though he mostly preferred to watch me dance rather than dance himself. It was also really crowded, so that made finding a place on the floor to dance kinda difficult. But he isn't completely turned off from swing dancing, so there's hope. ;-)

This weekend I get stuck doing mostly work. :-( I have my closed brief due (a polished paper that would be submitted to the court in support of one side winning on an issue in the case from which I have to do an oral argument before spring break - it's  ""closed"" because the prof limited the issue and gave us the materials so we don't have to do the research step since we're still learning), a mock hearing on Thurs where I'm the claimant's attorney so tons of prep for that, plus I'm ""on-call"" for one of my classes to I have to be able to answer any question that comes my way on that material, and I need to start outlining my courses from the past 6 weeks. These are the times when most of us in my class are asking ourselves exactly why we decided to go to law school. But Spring Break is in two weeks, so just have to get to that."

"event","Tomorrow Chris and I head to Ohio. It should be an interesting trip, if nothing else. I'm mostly packed, just have to do a few things online (like pay beginning of month bills, order a packet for class next semester that we apparently can't get anywhere else, and print a map for meeting Josh and Betsy for lunch on the way out) and then I'm done except for loading the car with everything but what I need in the morning. There's a lot of stuff to pack up in the car and it's supposed to rain tomorrow. With lows in the 20s, I'm not sure how much can be packed tonight though. The roads are supposed to ice over tonight as well, so that could make the morning commute interesting, though it's largely turnpike so the roads will hopefully be clear. We've been fortunate. Living in a valley surrounded by actual mountains (Alleganies) means that we don't get much of anything, as it dissipates before getting here. No tornadoes, not much snow or ice in comparison to everywhere else, only rain, and even that is limited a lot of the time. It does get colder here, but the wind from the last storm system wasn't near as bad. We got down to single digits with wind chill, but my parents saw -20s in Ohio with it. I guess it's a good thing, since my apartment doesn't really retain heat so if it got into the negatives I'd be freezing."

"event","About halfway through my first semester of law school. Still alive, though sometimes more awake than other times. I've learned that coffee is my friend, especially for afternoon classes. I've learned the classes I thought I'd dread end up being ok, the ones I thought could be interesting are not so much so. One class I feel comfortable in, one I don't expect to feel comfortable in until Thanksgiving Break, one has shown me I can't write as well or think near as logically as I thought, and one I'm still trying to figure out what the heck the prof is talking about in class. Fortunately the library has several study guides on that subject area, so hopefully browsing a couple of those will help. Though I think I will have to go in and see my prof to figure out what we're supposed to be getting out of his class. Because right now, I ain't got nuttin'.

Am watching Buffy and The Office with Chris. The two shows are quite the contrast. It's fun. He's introducing me to the office - we're 1/3 through season 2, and I'm introducing him to Buffy - halfway through season 2 (next episode is Surprise.) ;-) 

Went to Gettysburg with Chris and Kristin yesterday. Kristin is a fellow 1L who shares all but one of my classes, and is a history grad who spent a summer interning in Gettysburg. Now I need to watch the movie to get a more visual understanding of what all happened, then go back again and piece it all together. The thing that struck me the most yesterday was just how huge the area was. I guess I'm used to being able to walk around most places that are historic, but the amount of land covered by the various Gettysburg memorials is too large to walk. It helps me understand a bit more just how many Americans were involved in this war. 

I think I know how I'm spending my summer. Or at least a plan so long as doors remain open. Right now PA government is under a hiring freeze so I was a little concerned about finding worthwhile summer employment. Most of my classmates are using it as an excuse to participate in the study abroad programs at the school, but with the fall of the dollar, those trips are going to become increasingly more expensive. Plus I've kinda dropped my international law idea. There is too much to do in this country, and my passion lies on the homefront. So hopefully I'll be able to apply for one of the 3 fellowship programs, preferably the IOTA fellowship, which will basically provide funding for me to be able to work for a legal services clinic all summer, making a low amount of pay compared to firm work, but more than I've made at any other job I've held down, including my full-time permanent one. I'd pretty much be tossed into legal work, but helping those people who have no where else to go. Tons of hands-on-experience, and hopefully the ability to determine if this is the route I want to go in my legal studies or not. If not I can always go for a clerkship my second summer, as those are not available until your second summer or third year. There is also a clinic that focuses in on policy issues that I'm interested in, as well as a clinic in family law and one in child advocacy (and I can only pick one of the three to actually take) so a summer at legal services will hopefully be helpful in determining future direction in that regard. But that's the summer. I'm not even allowed to prep a resume for another month (there was too much pressure on 1Ls to get resumes out during orientation to be competitive for summer employment and that was too much to worry about with adjusting to law school, so ABA capped when 1Ls were able to meet with career services, submit resumes to employers, etc. to avoid the race to be the first school to get the 1Ls applying for jobs. We can't do much of anything until Nov 1st now, which is ok. We can still browse websites and see what opportunities are there, we just can't apply or interview or anything. But it gives one time to do research and mull over the decision more I think.) 

Well, that's my life right now. I am slowly making law school friends, keeping my head above water in regards to schoolwork (albeit barely in one class), starting to get minimally involved with a couple of extracurricular groups, and spending most of my weekends hanging out with Chris and sometimes other 1Ls. I've been to Hershey Park and Chocolate World, Troegs Brewery, Gettysburg, gone ice skating, karaoke, hiking, played tennis and racquetball and attempted various new recipes. I've watched lots of movies, played lots of games, read way too many pages of law books already, and have learned a ton. So much so that *everything* reminds me of something we've talked about in one of my classes. It's been fun, difficult, challenging, exhausting, exciting, and sad. I've missed Ohio tremendously, even while liking the views of the mountains that never leave. PA is beautiful, OH was familiar. I've still only been here 2 full months really. It seems longer a lot of the time. Eventually PA will become home, but for now I still see myself as an Ohioan, despite how messed up my former state actually is. Change is hard. Good, necessary, and inevitable, but hard. But it'll come. Just takes time, and I am always so impatient. 

Seeing as how I'm reflectively rambling and should have been in bed 30 min ago, I guess I'll end there. Need to get up in the morning and finish an assignment before class as it is."

"event","So, the class that made sense to me now doesn't, and the class that didn't now does. I guess I give up being able to make sense of all my classes at the same time. 

PA truckers are nuts. They like to push you down the highway 10-15 mph over the speed limit. I find that rather ironic in light that PA also punishes traffic violations more severely, with higher fines than OH as well as a court appearance. As far as I've been told (class discussion, one perk of law school) you can't just pay the fine and be done with it like in Ohio, you have to appear before a judge, even for minor traffic violations. And I mean things like 5 mph over the speed limit if you're caught. Ironically, the truckers are the ones I've seen pulled over on the highway. I just have to watch the back roads because a line down the middle of the street no longer = automatic 35 mph zone. 

I was going to get my driver's license today. Except the place is closed on Mondays. Guess I'll get it Wed then and hope they have the form I need to get the title processing done so I can drop that off next Tues since it apparently won't be happening tomorrow. 

I'm tired. I have not slept through the night since moving to PA. I think it's all the noises in my apt. I need to find ways to eliminate some of them, like whenever anyone opens the downstairs door, the pressure moves my door. Apparently one of my neighbors knocked yesterday but I didn't know it to be any different than the typical sounds my door makes multiple times a day so I didn't think anything of it. I'd say something to my landlord, but considering he hasn't done any of the repair work they said they were going to do, I think it better I find something ""temporary"" that will likely end up being the long-term solution. For the door, I think it means putting my brick (remember the fun multi-colored ones we made our last year which also served as an excuse to pull off one last surprise party for *uk*?)

I start running today I think. My quad is a bit sore for an unknown reason, but I should be able to work that out. Maybe I'll eat lunch, take a nap, get up and make more coffee, then go running and finally settle into homework."

"event","Yesterday Chris and I met up with Lars and Christie at a park near where Lars lives in Maryland. We started the day by hiking (a much more successful venture than Lynchburg had been, though we still managed to have issues staying on the path...guess that's what happens when you go backwards along the trail.) It was a 5.5 mile hike, with random stops for Lars to take pictures of various fungi, spiders and anything else that caught his eye, and afterwards we sat out on picnic tables and had our pre-packed lunches and talked. By that point Lars and I had become comfortable in banter, leading to much fun and laughter for all of us. We determined after lunch to make our way to the National Mall via the Metro, and Chris and I followed Christie and Lars to the station, where Chris learned how to secure a fare card. We didn't have to wait too long despite delays due to construction on some of the tracks, and soon we found ourselves in the bustle of the National Mall. Due to the warm weather, Lars suggested we start with a museum and we opted to go to the Air and Space Museum. There we learned about early flight from a temporary display, and observed all the changes the museum had to make to reclassify Pluto in its space exhibit. After an hour or so we headed out to do a walking tour of most of the monuments. On our way to the first monument, banter brought us to a discussion of whether or not it would be faster to walk or hop on one foot through the Mall, leading to a demonstration of just how quickly Lars can hop on one foot (probably as fast, or faster than I can run, so it was impressive.) Then Christie and I had a race to see who could hop on one foot the fastest, though we forgot to pick a finish line before we started. To top off our craziness, Christie found a grassy area and asked Lars to demonstrate his talent to walk on his hands, which was again quite impressive. Chris looked on during our craziness, much amused. 

The remainder of the day found me skipping down sidewalks, Christie and Lars soaking their feet in the water by the WWII monument, and various pictures being taken. Before long it was time to head back to the Metro and a welcome reprieve from all the walking we'd been doing that day. At the station, Christie found she had misplaced her card while Lars was in a hurry to catch the train about to arrive. Fortunately Christie found her card in time and we made it down with a minute left before the train arrived. The next station found us running up stairs to catch a train that was arriving as we got off to switch lines. Lars would have made it, but the rest of us got there just as the doors shut. But it was quite the adventure, running full speed through a metro station, up stairs and around corners. ;-) 

Back at the cars we opted to go get pizza for dinner, then after being given wrong directions, finally made it to the pizza place, only to find out we couldn't eat in. So we went back to the park and ended the day where it started for the four of us. After a few minutes of ""girl time"" where I confirmed that Lars is indeed a great guy and that Christie did well, ;-) we said our goodbyes, :*( and headed home. 

It was an amazingly fun day for the four of us, and we home to keep getting together when we can. Personalities mesh well, and it's great to see Christie and Lars together - they're good for each other. :-) Next time we might camp out and spend the day hiking at a different park that has waterfalls and such, but that probably won't be until I have off from school in November. :-(  Too far away, in my opinion. :-P"

And there's the stack of empty boxes to be torn down and put somewhere until trash and recyclables go out on Friday. Chris comes over tomorrow after work to help me finish putting together a few things I can't seem to get on my own and I want this place to be reasonably non-disasterish. So I'll cook tomorrow too: italian chicken with brown rice, steamed carrots, and fresh watermelon. Maybe banana bread for dessert if the oven is in good shape. Not because I have to, or it's expected, or even to impress, but because I want to. Because he'd appreciate it, and knowing that makes me want to cook.

"event","Yesterday was my date with Chris. Before that though, I had to get up at 4:30am to get my dad to the airport, so I wasn't even really thinking about the date until I got off at the highway exit where I was to meet him. I called when I arrived (since the time was variable due to me needing to check my dad in and not knowing how long lines would take and such), and he met me in the parking lot. We decided it was a good time to go play tennis rather than waiting til the evening, so we went and hit a ball around for a bit (apparently my racquetball tendencies make me a fairly poor tennis player technique-wise.) I was nervous for most of the time, not really sure what Chris was thinking, or if he was unhappy with my lacking tennis skills. After a bit my lack of sleep the past several days started getting to me, and we decided to go back to his place where I taught him how to play Settlers of Catan (so he won't be completely lost if we play with Christie and Lars next weekend.) We then went to lunch at Isaac's, a nice deli place they have in this area that's kinda like Panera, but better. After lunch we sat in the parking lot trying to figure out what to do. I didn't have the energy for much active, and it was getting ready to storm out, so most of our previous plans were shot. We ended up going back to his place and watching Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country (Chris really likes the Star Trek movies, and I hadn't seen them for a long while and a tiny bit of cheesiness was fun.) After the movie we sat around and talked for a while, then went to get Chinese for dinner. At some point in the movie I finally started to relax, and the latter half of the day was much more enjoyable for me. After dinner we went walking around the neighborhood to explore since Chris hadn't done that much yet, and I was back to my typical hyper self. After walking we opted to go play Bocce (which I ended up doing really well at) and then went back to Chris' to chill for a little bit before I headed home. It was a great day, and I hope there will be many more like it, especially next Sat. ;-) He enjoys my silliness, and I was completely comfortable just being with him - we didn't have to *do* anything, even talk. I think I really like this guy. ;-)"

It's not too bad really. Most rooms it's just wiping down the windows and vaccuuming. The bathrooms will take longer, but I'm used to cleaning those so it's not a big deal. The kitchen will be the hardest, but my mom is coming to help so I think I'll have her do the kitchen.

"event","Well, since I'm waiting to hear from Jenn and don't want to jump right back into thesis stuff only to have that interrupted, I might as well post so Christie and Kelly aren't the only ones. 

Life has been busy. Nothing new there. I am finished with work, and while the goodbyes were sad, I'm very glad to have the extra time to my day. Yesterday I bought an area rug for my new apartment (that has hardwood floors) got a wedding present for Heather and Joel's wedding this weekend and secured pickup of the Uhaul at a local place so I won't be having to pick it up 30 min away like my roommate did when she moved her stuff to Chicago. (I guess in general they just pick a place in the city, but if you go somewhere local they can call and be put down as the preference and the chances of you getting the equipment there is about 95%, and this place said that I gave enough notice that it should be a problem and if it ends up being an issue to call them and they'll go get the truck for me.) I also found out my idea with getting the hitch on Thurs morning as we head out is not only doable, but recommended, so that made me happy. Then to end my afternoon yesterday, I went swimming for the first time this season, and found out how out-of-shape I am. I was sooo exhausted afterwards that all I managed to do is cook dinner and bum around the apartment for the rest of the evening, and talk to Chris a bit. 

Today I determined that my thesis needs to be fully drafted before I leave for the wedding Fri at 2am, so I have been working on that most of the day. It's coming, hopefully I'll get what I have read through tonight and can finish the last handful of case analysis and conclusions tomorrow. It's 75 pages so far and  have at least two chapters left to write plus an additional paragraph on each section, so the length won't be a problem. I also went out to WSU to give my intro and background chapter to my professor, fill out my Program of Study, and pay for summer tuition. Now I'm waiting to hear from Jenn so we can go hang out for a bit, then it'll be back to the books with maybe an hour of talking with Chris tonight. 

Things with Chris and I have been doing fairly well. We're kinda at a point where we've maxed out the capacity of skype/internet communications and are just biding our time until we can actually meet on Aug. 2. We had our first semi-disagreement yesterday, mostly just that he didn't want to get into a habit of having to have long phone/skype conversations every night becasue he keeps him from being able to get things done. I took that the wrong way and emotionally panicked, and that led to the disagreement over skype. But we both agree that it will be much less of an issue once I live 30 min away and I can go over and hang out at his place and do homework while he does other random things around the apartment eliminating the either/or scenario that currently exists. 16 days til I move, 18 days til Chris and I meet. Within that time I get to pack up my apartment, finish my thesis, defend my thesis, resolve an issue with my oil pan on my car, get my brakes fixed, resolve an issue with my contacts, go through the myriad of stuff still at my parent's house, drive to NY and back to attend a wedding, and say lots of goodbyes. I'm still not exactly sure how it's all going to get done, but it will. It always does. For all my procrastination eventually productivity kicks in and I get it all accomplished."

"event","And the verdict is *almost* in...

I know I haven't written much about my law school search, and that was on purpose. I just didn't want to make public the craziness and my various offers and where I decided to visit and such. But I will comment a little bit now about the two schools I'm deciding between for my final decision.

The past two weekends have found me at Penn State Dickinson and Rutgers - Camden. My main lesson learned - I'm never flying United Air again. I won't go into that experience publicly, but I'm still recovering and still quite upset at them.

A small breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of both schools:

Penn State Dickinson, Carlisle campus:
small town, safety isn't an issue
strong International Law program
listens to student input
faculty seems strong and they are pulling in more and more top-notch scholars
study abroad programs
multiple exchange programs
top-notch technology in classroom
does not have ready access to the resources of a large school campus
would be in the transitional space for half of my law school education
lots of placement opportunities within Harrisburg and DC

Rutgers - Camden:
great faculty, though strengths in different areas than my current interests
the school doesn't have a study abroad program, though it's still possible to do through other area schools
lots of opportunities for pro bono work
area not as safe, but its workable
lots to do because of location near Philly and not too far from NYC
new building will be open by fall
nice campus, though parking is a bit of a hike
top placement in judicial clerkships
has both district court and federal appeals court within walking distance of campus and open to students to sit in on trials
very well known within the New Jersey/Philly area

Both schools have great students, lots of clinical opportunities and student orgs, and much to offer me as a student. Both have comparable alumni networks outside of the areas where the school has its main connections. Rutgers would cost more for living expenses and for the first year before I was able to obtain in-state tuition, but would be about the same for the last two years tuition wise. I could be happy at either school, though I would end up different at the end of the three years, possibly heading a different direction within the law, or at least looking to live an work in different areas. One I would remain more of a small-town girl, the other would make me much more of the city-girl I used to be before moving to the midwest. I've met people at both visitations that I would like to see again. I will have new facilities at both schools for at least part of my time there, though I like the transitional space at Penn State well enough that it doesn't bother me to be there for the first half of my legal education. Both are ranked identically at this point by U.S. News and World Report. Both have close-knit student bodies, that are close in size. I could see myself excelling at either campus easily.

At first this stressed me out, as the similarities make it very difficult to choose. I mean, it's not as if one is band and the other is good, or that one is better and the other best. It's more like comparing an apple and an orange - both are good for you, but in slightly different ways, and I have to figure out which one I want more.It helped that Steven, the guy I met right off at Rutgers because we both sat at the table nearest the food and were both exploring alone so we ended up hanging out all day, reminded me that the position I'm in isn't a negative one - I know, most of you have been telling me that, but it finally clicked then - that I have two great schools to choose from and that there isn't a wrong decision. I finally get it. It doesn't make the decision easy, but it takes some of the stress away. Who I end up becoming and what path I choose after law school will be partially shaped by the school I choose, yes, but choosing one school over the other won't be a mistake. It's just a fork in the road, and i have to decide based on what I know, and then not look back. And it's a decision I will make this week, as deposits are due. Then I send ""no, thanks"" letters to the rest of my schools - including Dayton, who must have lost my app cause I still haven't heard from them - and focus on my thesis.

To that end I think I will buy a parking pass and opt to spend every weekend evening cept for Wed at WSU from now on. I can use the exercise facilities since I'm technically a student again, then spend time reading my cases and writing my paper. The weekends I will spend at the apartment cleaning and hanging out with friends, either online, via phone or in person, depending on what's happening at the time. Come mid-June, my Master's will be done and I will spend the summer sorting through everything I own to par it down before I move out of state, because that at least is certain - I am leaving Ohio at the end of July."

"event","I sent in UD and UC today. So the local schools are all finished. Now I have to decide which other schools of the 5 others I'm working on next. Penn State and IU are due next, but I feel compelled to stay more in-state right now, so I wonder if it's worth applying there. Then again, I might change my mind, so I probably will at least apply to those two. Capital and Toledo aren't due until May, and Cleveland not til August, so I may take some time away from this before applying there. Or I may just knock all of them out in the next two weeks and be done, then see what offers I get. 

But I'm done with law school apps for the day. Time for an ep of Buffy while I eat breakfast/lunch, then cleaning, then schoolwork and practicing for solo audition tomorrow."

"event","Law School apps that is. I sent in OSU's tonight. I am planning to finish UC's, Toledo's and Cleveland's tomorrow. They each need a bit of work yet, but most of it is minor stuff, a bit of research on the school to fine tune a personal statement or a call home to get parents' tax info. The latter three require me to rewrite my personal statement. And 2 of them are out-of-state when I'm once again thinking of staying in-state. So those will likely wait a week, though not much more than a week since two of them are due March 1st. 

In other news, I finished (1st draft essentially) of a 117 slide powerpoint that will be converted to video next week. This was after messing with tech stuff all day, first by troubleshooting a printer at one of our facilities, then installing RAM in my own computer, then setting up the projector at work for a presentation, only to have it not work and the instructor decided to move to a TV to present, but thought every DVD-type disk could be played on a TV...yeah, try explaining the difference between a CD-ROM and a DVD to someone who doesn't get tech stuff (""it works when I play it on my computer, so why doesn't it work on this screen?"") Yeah. But at least I convinced my supervisor that I need to scavenge the electronics closet for better peripherals for the group homes and that I should take a computer inventory of each home sometime in the next few months - something I've been pushing for since summer. And I was so busy I didn't get to eat lunch, so my supervisor let me leave 30 min early instead. :-) So overall a crazy but productive day. I'm slowly starting to wade through the mountains of stuff that has been heaped on me, and maybe by next Thurs I'll be caught up. 

For now, I'm going out with friends. Was invited over for dinner and a movie and since August Rush isn't playing around here anymore for me to go see it (my original plans for the night) I figured I'd be better off vegging with friends than vegging here by myself. It's not like I'm gonna do homework on a Fri..."

"event","My first law school application is officially submitted, even though in the process I kinda found I didn't like dealing with admissions people and was irked that they didn't waive my fee so I still had to send them $40 even though every other school will waive the fee. But it's sent and out of my hands except to drop off a form to WSU to have them send my transcript as soon as the grade is fixed, and I will do that Monday when I'm there for swing. I work on 4 OH school applications tomorrow, and make a decision about Capital, Case Western, Cleveland, FL Coastal, the PA school that offered me money and any other school that has contacted me. I will chose 3-5 more schools plus NKU (today), OSU, UD, UT, and UC. 

But now I think I'm going to have dinner and see about going to see either August Rush or Enchanted (with plans to see the other one tomorrow evening cause they are both in cheap seats here.)"

"event","I guess I shoulda explained that test a bit more, well at least some things about it. See, the Meyers-Briggs results are the only ones that haven't changed since I first took them my Freshman year at CU. I've always been an ENFJ. I find it incredibly ironic because it's the personality of the ""natural"" teacher, and yet I didn't do so hot teaching in the classroom. I know I am a teacher at heart, just not within the spectrum of the current pre-collegiate or maybe even collegiate infrastructure it seems. 

This time around I saw the King David was an ENFJ supposedly. I guess it makes my left-brain right-brain combination make bit more more sense as he was a definite artisan, but also a great strategic mastermind as well. 

I finished Heroes season 1 on Monday. And the rest of this week is too busy for my liking. Tonight I mist finish my wedding/Christmas shopping, make dessert for work party tomorrow, and go to rehearsal for the Christmas Eve services. Tomorrow I have the work party, then Heather and I get everything together for the wedding on Sat. Sat I spend lots of hours in the car, driving to PA and back, maybe back. I might get lucky and find a place to crash so I'm not driving by myself late at night. Oh, and I have to drop my roommate off at the Pittsburgh airport that night too. Sun I'll hopefully be driving back from the wedding (or spending the morning at church and then crashing for the afternoon.) Either way, that night is the Christmas dinner at a friend's apartment for those not already home for the holidays. Monday I work til 4:30pm, then head out to church to run sound for the two Christmas Eve services. That will get over about 9pm, at which point I'll decide whether I'm going to my parents' house then or Christmas morning. I'm leaning towards Christmas Eve, but we shall see. Depends on how tired I am and how much caffeine I want to consume. Tues is Christmas, and that night I head back to my apartment because I have to work the day after. Wed, Thurs, and Fri is work, with rehearsal Thurs night. The weekend is open - the first open one in a while. Then I work Mon, go to a New Year's Eve party til sometime Tues morning. and the Wed I get my LSAT scores and we'll see what happens from there. So it's crazy right now, but the end is in sight. :-)"

"event","I finally saw Stardust. I liked it. It was a good movie to end the workweek and begin the weekend on. 

Last Friday I watched Pan's Labyrinth . I'm not sure I liked that movie much, most cause it's really gory for my taste and almost all the good guys die. More realistic maybe, and definitely in that time period, but not my idea of a nice way to begin the weekend. 

What's interesting is that both movies would be considered adult fairy tales ,and there's a lot of death in both movies, but my reaction to that death is quite different because of the context in the movie. For one, Stardust isn't gory, and y'all know how I feel about gore. But for two, the people seen as good live - the ones who die are more on the bad or grey side of things, which somehow seems to justify it. 

So is it perhaps a thought that people who are ""bad"" deserve death more? Why does one both me and the other doesn't? Is it in presentation, as death is kinda a comic relief part of Stardust? 

Anyway, having seen both movies within a week of each other, I can't help but compare to an extent. Perhaps that's my fault - I can't take things as they are without seeing how they fit into  a larger context, generally of my own choosing and largely dependent on whatever else is going through my mind at the time. 

Thoughts, comments? About the movies or my ramblings..."

"event","Today has been a really hard day at work. Actually more like the capstone of a couple of hard days. Yesterday I worked on the funeral program for one of our residents who passed away recently. Then one of my co-workers got a phone call saying her mother was having chest pains - turned out to be a heart attack. This morning I was given a list of people who needed cards mailed out - either surgeries, hospitalizations, or loss of a loved one. Then my supervisor comes in and asks for a card for another resident who was just declared to be terminal with a very fast-moving cancer. What do you say to a person who's dying?

Already distraught over what to put in that card, I get another call saying that a co-worker was in an auto-accident and flipped his jeep. That's the second accident  involving a co-worker in the past few weeks. I'm kinda afraid to answer the phone at this point, since everyone else is at the funeral and I'm the only one here, so if another emergency arises I have no idea what I'll do. It's just been a very emotional day, and I'm ready to crash."

"event","but I'm writing a post instead. Oh well. The work will get done. Just not all of it today, since in less than an hour I'm going to the local Cheap Seats (in Beavercreek actually - not as nice as the one in Huber or South Dayton, but closer) to watch Ratatouille. I've been waiting to see that movie for quite some time now and was just gonna wait til it came out on video, but that's another month and I'm in the mood for a comedy. Tim is joining me, as he hasn't see it either and we originally talked about going months ago, so it should be fun. 

I also finished The Rainmaker this morning. I had read the first 14 chapters, got disgusted and bored and decided not to finish it, then Doug loaned me his copy (cause I was reading a copy my roommate had borrowed and she needed to give it back) and told me to finish it cause he thought I'd like it when I finally got into it. I told him it wouldn't be til Dec, after all the school craziness, so he'll be surprised to get his book back on Tues. But he's also been on my case to read more not school stuff, and well, maybe he's right, cause I am certainly a LOT less stressed now and actually inspired to write (good storytelling always does that to me, though often more in written form than visual.) Perhaps I've found a key for me to write papers - read a good book, and then while I'm on the euphoria that comes after, sit down and draft my paper. It means I haven't gotten everything done I intended to today, but it will get done this week, hands down, and it's not like today was unproductive - I have the hardest part of my paper written, now I just need to go back through the cases and fill out the meat of the paper. But I'll trade the slight delay for a bit of emotional stability any day, cause in the end it means I'm more productive and less overwhelmed to the point of accomplishing nothing. Plus I think I freaked out a couple of people at church on Thurs when I crashed from my euphoric emotional high to a downtrodden low brought on by frustration with sound stuff and the natural emotional rollercoaster I'm always on. I guess guys in general don't completely understand how to react when a girl is crying but it's not something they can fix so they freak out a bit. It'll be good for them to see me back to my ""normal"" efficient and mostly relaxed self who enjoys running sound instead of it stressing me out to the point of tears. Plus there's a Music/Tech team get-together tomorrow night complete with hayride and bonfire (even though it's sadly gonna be 90 degrees, so it won't really feel like fall) so I'll actually get to hang out with people instead of just having brief conversations regarding music/sound stuff. I've been looking forward to it for a few weeks now cause we have some really cool people on the music teams I've been wanting to talk to. :-)

OK, time for me to get working on my chart, eat, then get ready for tonight. :-D"

"event","So, I get on Lexis this morning to make sure I have all the state cases citing my primary case for this paper I've been working on. I figured maybe there would be one or two I missed that had been decided since the original research done over a year ago. Yeah...so not the best idea. I found 32 more cases not on my original list, over a ream worth of paper printed double sided. I don't have the time to read all of these and get my paper written in the next week. So I panicked. And then I realized that the independent study had been approved with the original case list, so I'm just going to stick to that for this paper. I'll have to read the cases in a couple months and add them to the chapter for my thesis, but I can work on that after law schools are applied to and the LSAT has been taken. I'm not panicked currently, though I am a bit overwhelmed. 81 state cases citing Employment Division v. Smith (originally 49), and over 200 federal ones. And that doesn't count the chapters explaining the free exercise clause and its history, the background of Smith and why it's important, and RFRA and its aftereffects (which were to take up 30-40 pages.) Maybe my thesis topic was a bit ambitious for a 100-page paper."

"event","This law school decision maybe seems sudden to some of you. Maybe not - maybe y'all saw it coming before I did. But as I was writing my personal statement and reflecting on where God has taken me over the past several years, I'm certain it was all part of the plan. It just took someone I trusted who really knew none of the background to make a logical argument to get me to reflect enough to realize this was my path. At that point it was like God was asking ""will you go?"" And I knew the answer, probably have known since high school. I just finally stopped running. 

Now that I've embraced the decision things in my life have been falling into place like clockwork almost. The fee waiver went through, paving the way for me to actually pay for all the tests and applications. Now I've found the school I think will be my top choice (and which I have a decent chance of getting into) and the scholars program I'm striving to be accepted for, just like at CU and WSU. I've also figured out how to ""raise"" my undergrad GPA (by pointing out that my music classes were more performance based and thus drug my overall GPA down - my GPA is easily a 3.8 without the music classes (3.4 GPA for music classes - 3.6 overall and I had lots more music credits.))

Tonight I was inspired to draft my personal statement - the most intimidating part of the application becasue it's 3 pages of finding a way to convince the school why I should be accepted (and why I should be one of their scholars.) It's only a draft, but it's a start, even if the next step is to trash it and start over. 

Most of all I've found a peace about my future. I'm excited about all this prep work, not stressed. My stomach still does flip flops as I walk down the library aisles filled with law books and think about some of the classes I'll be taking, but I know I can do - though it will be the biggest academic challenge I've faced so far. I honestly can't wait to be among peers again, all pushing each other to be the best and struggling together through classes and briefs. (1L is a bonding year, kinda like MoMM was just by nature of the classes you are taking.) I can't wait to be a student again, not just this loaner trying to write a huge paper while working full time (a frustrating place to be when I really do want to just spend hours a day on my thesis and can't.)

Anyway, that's where all this came from. It can technically be traced back to my Mock Trial days in high school where I briefly looked at pre-law majors before deciding I was going to be a band director."

Now I go work on my paper.

*sigh* - why does my motivation to get things done generally miss the task at hand and extend to that which does not yet need my attention?"

"event","Twas a productive day at work. I actually surprised myself at the amount I was able to get done. I reworked section 1 on all the active SLP files (about 100 files done today) before 11am, amidst answering phones and other smaller tasks. Then I did all of my filing and typed up detailed instructions for setting up and maintaining the web domain emails and setting them up in Outlook. All before 1pm, at which point there was a luncheon. Then in the last two hours of the day I was able to get about a quarter of the archived files organized and shelved and another quarter of those files temporarily stored in a cabinet rather than stacks on the floor (which they were tossed in when we discovered the AC was leaking and the ceiling tiles in part of the room about to collapse.) By the end of that project we will have an organized cabinet of overflow and closed files archived and complete lists of all past and present clients in all programs, since current lists only go back to 2004 and our files have to be kept for seven years after final closure. I hope to finish the archive this week, though tomorrow we're supposed to get Adobe Creative Suite and the new external harddrives we are going to use to replace our current server tape backup, so I may have other projects take precedent. We shall see.

In other news...literally the news this time, the Supreme Court is down to the last week of this term, and thus we shall be seeing decisions on controversial cases come out this week. Three such decisions came out today. One of them few people not in politics probably care about - Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life. While I haven't had the chance to read the case in full yet (the library emailed me and said they had a copy of Battlestar Galatica 2.5 in so I watched that tonight instead of reading case law) the basics of the case include the ability of certain groups to advertise within a specific time frame of an election. Basically, corporations couldn't pay for ads or other broadcasts that promote a candidate or issues that mention candidates within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary election. As you can likely imagine, there's a 1st amendment free speech issue here.

In the case at hand, the broadcast was urging citizens to contact their senators regarding a proposed judicial filibuster (coughAlitocough) and ask them to oppose the filibuster. Well, it just so happened that one of the Senators was up for reelection, and this ad fell within the 30 days before the primary election. So it was illegal to show them, even though the action promoted had little to do with the election. Thus arose a case as the Wisconsin Right to Life organization proposed that the restriction violated First amendment freedom of speech. The Supreme Court ruled that the restrictions were unconstitutional since they violated freedom of speech in not allowing ads to be run in which the message was not campaign advocacy. For those who care - it falls under the legal test of compelling state interest because it's a burden on political speech, and thus the government has to prove that there is a compelling interest in regulating political speech in this manner and that the regulation is narrowly tailored to not catch anything outside of that specific interest. The compelling interest is that of denying ads compelling voters to vote a specific way close to election time, and the court sees that interest as compelling. However, the ad in question doesn't fit into that specific interest, and yet the regulations bans it, so the regulation is not narrowly tailored enough, and thus the regulation is unconstitutional as applied in this particular case.

Now why it took the Supreme Court two months to come up with that, I'm not entirely sure...The end result: 6-3, with two concurring opinions and a dissent - so much for Roberts' desire for unity. Kennedy and Souter joined the conservatives, and oddly enough, no one completely agreed with Roberts' majority opinion, hence the two concurring opinions. Guess everyone had to have their say.

The other two cases are much more interesting to the general populace and thus would require a greater discussion. This entry is sufficiently long already, and so I think I'll wait until tomorrow to post on the faith-based initiatives and the student speech cases, as I find both of them rather intriguing and worth more description to point out the underlying issues.

I guess now would be a good time to say that thanks to discussions with a couple of friends in recent days, I have finally determined that yes, politics is definitely a passion of mine, and I kinda like the legal/court stuff, but no, I'm not going to law school. I thinking maybe legal research from the policy side of things or a think tank position would be good, and likely eventually getting my PhD and teaching collegiately. That's if I don't end up just moving to Portland and opening a coffee shop. ;-)

Anyway, enough for tonight. Tune in tomorrow for our next adventure into the realm of current controversial Supreme Court decisions. Goodbye, and goodnight."

"event","So...the week was going decently, then on Thurs my car decided to essentially go caput. I've been having transmission issues for a while, and I knew it was getting worse, but on Thurs my car decided it didn't want to leave 1st gear for the first half of the trip home. It finally jolted into 2nd gear and was ok for the last half of the ride, but the check engine light kept going on and off, and it really didn't sound good. I fortuantely made it home, but am afraid to drive it anywhere again. I just have the sense that the next trip it takes will be one-way. So I of course panicked cause I had no way to get to rehearsal or anything on Fri including work. I ended up skipping rehearsal, and my roommate took me to get groceries that night. I was able to get a ride to work from Angi (I didn't know who else to call at this point and I helped her with car stuff before) and Jared picked me up from work, then picked up Angi a bit later when she got off and we all went to this dance thing we were teaching at. Fortuantely Jared and Angi were planning to go see Spiderman 3 fter the dance thing, and my roommate was getting a group to go see it that night too, so we ended up meeting up at the theater later that night and I rode home with my roommate. Then today my brother picked me up and we went car shopping all day, and finally found a car I can live with. It's a 2000 Dodge Neon. I wasn't planning to get something that new, but banks won't finance anything older anymore, and since I don't have enough credit built up they are really picky on what they will finance. (Just one more way it seems the system is made to screw those of us who choose to better ourselves through focusing on our education rather than having a full-time job.) Anyway, this is through a dealer near my church, and it seems like they will be good to deal with. There's even a 3 month warranty on it so if I drive it a bit and find an issue they will fix it - I don't have to feel super rushed to have checked everything out completely right away. Dad says they'll also clean it up really nicely and maybe even fill up the gas tank for me. I get it Monday - it was around 5 today that we were out there and all the financial people were closed by then. So I'm not going to church tomorrow for the first time in who knows how long. It'll be so weird. But Heather will be back after church and Joel will leave for the summer, so she'll want to do something lest she dwell on not seeing him for a month or so, and Nate's coming over at some point tomorrow too. Nate is one of the guys from breakfast club who has an apartment in the same complex for this summer, so he'll probably come up a bit in my posts and conversations. 

So anyway, crisis came, crisis mostly fixed, though I need to find a ride back from work or see if the deal can pick me up. I'm not overly happy about having a car payment because it means not paying off my credit cards as quickly, but it might just be worth having a safe and dependable car again, and I will definitely have better gas mileage. I'm hoping to start teaching lessons again over the summer to help supplement my income, so that could help get me financially situated too I hope. 

Anyway, that's the big thing in my life now. Lots going on, but I hear my roommate downstairs so I'll write that another time."

"event","Life is a bit more under control now. I have a job, finally. (There's kinda a story, I might put it on here later.) I like my job well enough. It's not super exciting or challenging, but it's good experience and it pays the rent and the people I work with are pretty cool. It's a receptionist position, so it's a desk job, but I do get my own office. It's kinda shared space, but it's mostly mine. I got a few things to decorate with tonight. Eventually I want to add pics of people and a bit more personal touch, but right now a few posters and a small dry erase pad where I'll comment about the weather just to make people laugh when they walk in will have to do. Hopefully by the end of the week I'll add a desk calendar and the good comics from that calendar shall find their way to the walls as well.

With thinking of decorations, I thought a lot about how much my office can say about me to those I work with. I'm planning to make it an encouraging place, one full of color and life, because I'm full of life, hopes and dreams, and the organization I'm working for helps bring life and hope to those in need. It's hard a lot of the times, and it makes a difference that I can be joyful and efficient at what I do. It speaks louder than any words ever could.

With the addition of work to my schedule, things have been booked solid. I'm still doing full weekends at Ginghamsburg, by choice, so I don't have a day off to just chill. Tonight I skipped basketball to run errands and hopefully get to bed a little early since this weekend was difficult and I slept very little. Tues I still have small group, Wed I'll be taking a class a church starting next week, Thurs is choir or sound stuff, and Fri I was hoping to pick up Jr. High ministry, but I think I'll hold off a bit on that, at least until April. I get off work at 5, so on Tues and Thurs I get home long enough to change and leave again. Wed has a tiny bit more leeway, but not much. I'm still trying to figure out when to get groceries and do laundry and clean and all that. It's a big adjustment, this full-time job deal.

Anyway, just wanted to let y'all know what was going on since I haven't posted in a while. I don't get internet at work so I can't update from there and my time at home is limited, so I may not post more than once or twice a week. I also can't talk about work, and that takes up a good bit of my life, so I'll have to think of something else interesting to say...not that that's too difficult, with the way my mind works, but getting the thoughts into words and phrases that anyone else can understand, now that's the challenge."

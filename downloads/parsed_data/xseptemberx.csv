I just think its funny. you think you know it all. yet, everything around you is a dramafest. you are 19, and still type and act like you are 13 years old. The only thing i have to say is...Yes, i may be a bit immature for my age. yet, i am a late bloomer. as posted in the post below or so..but, i still act like im 24, when i need to. thats the difference between me and you. and thats all i have to say to this."

"event","So, i have been thinking... At this age is a relationship really necessary? I dont really think it is. I mean since i was 18, i always wanted to be in an intimate long term relationship. As i got older this changed. i just dont think i really realized it. I am not going to lie. I am horny. and well, i also realized all i wanted was to be single, and hook up when i can. I have also found out..I am 110% girl crazy..yet i catch myself acting like i am not. I mean, there OTHER things in life to focus on besides females, right? WRONG!! I have tried it...for me, it just doesnt work. I have decided there are 3 things in this world that make me tick..
1)Music/playing music
2)Girls
3)technology like computers, video games ect. cool musical insturments.

I would say money is also important to me, yet it is important to MOST people in this world.

Ok, so here we go..I like music, music brings girls, so there for i = girl crazy. i just dont play music to get girls. yet, i wont lie...its a HUGE reason why i want to be in a band...And play out. Girls love a drummer in a band! Girls love musicians period. I think the only reason i have been so lucky in getting girls is purely off the fact that...I am a musician, and i have a half way decent personality! 

So there you go girls. and boys. I think relationships are a good thing..yet, i think i will find the right girl in time. yet, i am not really looking for her. I am not looking for anyone right now..I just want to make friends with girls..Maybe if things sexually are strong...we can be friends with bennafits. 

Yet the fact remains. Yes i am getting old. yes i should be settling down. yet, i am a late bloomer. right now, in my mind, in my life...I feel like im 18, not 24...I mean, i didnt lose my virginity till i was 20..i didnt kiss a girl till i was 18. things just change..I have changed.. I dont know if i will ever settle down now. chances are..I will...Just right now...its time to let loose...and go with the flow! its time to get my life together as well..I am slowly figuring out who the real me is.

Anyways..I feel like im rambeling...pz

"event","So, i got service interruption on my phone cause i sent my bill in too late. now i have a 36 dollar re-activation fee as well as no money. Having a plan is not worth it if you are poor like me. I mean, i spend about 100 bux a month on this damn phone. they have all these hidden fees and shit! GRRRR, it really pisses me off. So, i decided...you know..do i really need this thing??? No, i dont! so i have cancelled my cell phone! yay!! Yes, they are handy, and thats why i have decided to get a pre-paid phone...the go phone actually, by AT&T! yeah, its only like 40 a month..its great..and it has 400 anytime minutes...like, free nights and weekends. its great...and you cant go over you minutes...No contract no hidden fees or chages. (I sound like a fucking phone advertisment) but, i think cell phones kick ass! they are so convinient. yet here are my words of wisdom. 

If you are poor like me. and would like to have an extra hundred or so bux at the end of the month...do yourself a favor...get a pre-paid phone...screw a service plan! 
ok, im out..

"event","I dont get it. every band i have been in in the past year has had some sort of musical confliction. Andy wants to be a bit more mellow, tony wants to be a bit more pop punk. i dont know, i just want to play. I am sooo sick of flip flopping from band to band. Its just like, what the shit??? I mean, for the record, i like this band. and i have liked all the bands i have played in. I am not that picky when it comes to playing in a band. As long as i am playing some form of emo, punk, emocore...i could honestly care less. I really think its a guitarist thing...Me and todd are fine with the band. i dont know, its like...everyone needs to just relax. and let this happen, let it flow. not everything can be the way we want it. I have learned to accept this. I agree with both andy and tony though. I think we should spice the vocal melodies up a good amount...yet, i dont want to sound like every other band out there...So, today me, tony and andy are getting together.. we are going to figure this out. If we write the vox as a band. i think the mix of andys more mellow vox and anthonys more upbeat vox...it will be a winning combo! i know we can work through this. i know it. this band has to last. if it doesnt..I will be pretty crushed. so, im sure we will work things out! 

this is the part where i complain about a girl. too bad i stopped caring.

Our new name is ""Riverside Hate Club"" Who knows if it will stick, but its a decent name. I kind of wish andy was around more, not just for the band, but as a friend.

"event","For some reason for the past couple of days, it seems like people (friends) are deliberatly avoidng me. Its probably just me, yet i am not sure. My mom always says i overstay my welcome. I think i do from time to time. yet sometimes, i think i understay my welcome. and thats when people seem to get offended. Right now im my life, i feel very alone. i feel like if i moved to some forign country. the only people who would wonder where i am is my work. cause i wouldnt be there to attend my schedule. 

Now on to liz. she thinks i dont trust her... I do, its just hard to think she seriously likes me after what has happened in the past. and the recent past too. She just has to understand it and see it from my point of view. I mean, i still like liz. yet, i think the crush has pretty much faded. when i hung out with her the other night.. there was definatly more passion there. yet, i dont think i feel the same about her as i use to. I have changed a lot since kim. and danielle helped me realize this. Its not liz that has the problem, its me. i just dont know what i want. I still want to get to know liz better, its just going to take time. i still like her a lot. we just need to work on it.

I have been talking to a girl, whos name will remain nameless. this girl is really different. her personality is amazing, the way she thinks is great! and its like she sees right through me. she reads everything on my mind. and to top it all off..shes a total hottie! I have never felt quite the way i have felt about her, compared to other girls..Kind of like the feeling i had for liz in the begining. Basically, i am confused. i dont really know what i want.. and what i want i can not have. for reasons that will remian unsaid. Anyways, im just taking life by the day, by the minute. whatever happens, just does. i might end up with liz, i might not. i dont know...and to be honest. i dont want to deliberatly make anything happen! 

I am worried about andy. He really needs to get his life in gear. I am not really sure what the consequences for him are. yet i know his moms getting pretty sick of him being jobless, and always in boston. I mean, i have had a lot of people agree with me on his whole situation. He has gone jobless now, for about 10 months. which is how long him and emma have been girlfriend and boyfriend. Now let me let you in on a little something. I have never met Emma, and andy is ""suppose"" to be my Best friend! I dont know, whats going on here? I would really like to meet this girl. Yet, i dont think i will. I know someday i will. just i dont see it happening soon. anyway. everyone agrees that andy needs to get his life back on track, or hes going to find himself screwed! I mean, i care about the kid so much, i love him like family. There is only so much you can do though..you tell him ""dude, seriously..you need a job, and you need to get your life and prioritys straight"" And hes just like ""yeah dude, i know."" which basically means, yeah dude i dont care fuck you. lol... He says things just to make people happy..its upsetting. anyways. i am not mad at the kid. i just see him sponging off emma, his mom. sometime one of them is going to get sick of it. i dont know though..i guess its none of my buisness. I just dont want to see the kid on the streets or some shit. anyway, next topic.

I am getting bad gut feelings about the band. i dont know, i dont think we will last. and if we do, i just dont think its going to work out. we are in a delemma. Like, eric...hes a cool kid, but.. hes not on our page musically... And i dont know...lately, i have been feeling a lot of tension between me and anthony. its like, i want to ring his neck and he wants to ring mine. yet. most times i want to hump him. i just think we need our space away from each other for a few days. we are two alike people, yet we are both very different, and have different tolerances.. then again, i over annalyze...EVERYTHING in my life. I think its unhealthy.. I just need to let things go more. i am going to work on that from now on..I just need to chill out..

Anyways, my minds going silly. i am going to go to work, that usally takes my mind off things. later.

"event","how i felt. it was a load off my chest. a good one too. I just hope she can move on from whats shes been in and been through. I like her, but i wont wait around forever. even though, i think i could. shes just that good. I have never really felt like this about anyone really. shes different, special, unique. she makes me tingle in ways no girl has been able to! I am not sure how or why, i just know she does. and maybe someday she can be mine. i wont get my hopes up though. cause whenever i do, my dreams seem to not come true. I am just taking it day by day, by the minute. if things work out, then im in heavan, if they dont, then im back where i started again. I just hope she feels the same way i feel about her."

I just dont know about girls. it seems like i always do something wrong. i do like someone right now, but i would rather keep it un-spoken, that way i dont jinx it. Anyways. i dont know...im bored, tired and i just want a break, i just want to rock out with the band and make that my life. i dont know, im out pz

"event","It almost seems like my ""EX"" is trying to make me jealous with her new boyfriend. I mean, c'mon. she has only known the kid for like, maybe a month and shes already with him, and loves him. i dont know, i just dont want the girl to get hurt. and with her moving so quickly, i see her getting hurt. We all know all good things come in time. Even if they feel so right. time is the only remody for anything good. And that is what i will admit ruined our relationship. if we took more time, in getting to know each other and grow with one and other. NONE of this would of happened. Not saying im right and shes wrong, but she is not taking time out to think. like i did, and what not. I know that i dont want anything serious in a relationship. or a relationship PERIOD! I mean, i wish her all the luck in the world, i really do, i just dont want to see her get hurt. I just think she is moving to quickly..and things will just end up getting fucked up cause she is missing the super important point that we missed..getting to know someone as a friend.
Anyway
The band is doing great! i think we will probably be playing sometime in early december. so, keep an eye out, we are called Andy is my hero. we have like 3 songs or so. we just need one or so more.. So, i will keep an update.

I guess thats about all the news i have for the time being. Feel free to IM me on AOL/AIM. my screen name is burning 8mm! so hit me up kids..dont be shy..

Maybe i am just becomming a wimp...this is all too much for me. i can only really handle a few big things in my life at a time. I dont know..I just find myself with no time to myslef...If i am not at school or doing homework, i am with the band..or at work..I miss having ME time. Those were the days! Anyways...not that anyone ever reads my posts....But, i do it for me anyways."

"event","Yeah, so. not much doing really. danielle and i seem to be at one and other throats... I dont know why really, but i am getting pretty sick of it.

so, i like this girl...her name will be unsaid until things actually happen. so, things seem to be looking up!

The new bands doing well, we came up with a new song yesterday. it was pretty fucking awesome! Andy seems to really be getting into the band now. I am pretty happy about this. i was scared he was going to get bored, lose interest, and just kind of ween his way away from it. Also we now have a bassist!!! good old Todd! Yeah, things are really comeing along with this band now...yesterday was magical. Oh, and i almost forgot..we now have a name...Its Andys my Hero! You like it? yes, no?!? We all like it a lot, It seemed to be the name we all agreed on with no doubts. Anyways...things are looking up!

I have to start concentrating on school. for real, right now..i should be doing homework! Yeah, so thats something i have to work on! 

Well, thats all folks.

"event","Hhaha, once again, a lot of things HAVE changed. So, i broke up with danielle due to lack of common intrests. Shes a great girl, and we are still great friends...She just was not my type, and she also found out, i wasnt really hers either. 

I am in a new band, we dont have a name, but we are melodic emocore. its a fun time, we should hopefully be playing out sometime in december.

I am single, and i pretty much want to stay this way. I am not sure what i want in a girl or a relationship. I just know i dont want to be tied down. I want to find something along the lines of ""friends with bennafits"" just not so cheaply..I want to find someone i can get into a serious friendship with, just one girl, not like 5 or anything..lol..I wont lie, i am horny, and i want something along the lines of friends with bennafits..but i want it to be more serious, its weird to explain..In anycase, i just want to play the field, and whatever happens..Just does! 

Work has been getting on my nerves lately...People around there are so uptight, ""its like working for disney"" Target is like no other place i have ever worked at. They try to be above and beyond, yet, they expect the world out of their team memebers aka employees. I will admit, i am a lazy fucker when it comes to working at shitty part time jobs...yet i dont know..Usually i am good at most of the other jobs i have worked at, at target its like they have individually trained professionl retail sales clerks..We are timmed on just about EVERYTHING we do, from assisting guest, answering phones, ringing the registers..its rediculous..And also, you are ALWAYS being watched...there is not ONE spot in that store where security cameras cant not see! the cemeras have magnified zoom...its like one of those satillite cams...its insane! In any case, i am getting pretty sick of working there, yet, im starting to like it again, its weird...the same thing happened to me at k-mart too. Like when i first started, i absolutely loved it...in the middle of it, i hated it! Then toward the end, i loved it again..Same with target..It just takes a while to get use to. 

Anyways, not much else to say here, I think i will be writing in here more, i hope...Later kids

I cared a lot about k mart too...its like...i catch myself actually caring a lot about the store..and like...whenever i see something i dont like..i get really bothered..Also...some of the people i work with there are just so amazing..they are knowledgeble and nice..respectful...Its such a relief..i have had a lot of good compliments on my proformance there...some bad ones..but i guess i cant be perfect...I am working on it..I am getting a lot better at my zone and such. other than that...I am golden...well, enough about Target...I am still looking for a band...I dont know...Andy seems all into it..but hes always got his prioritys elsewhere...so it seems...I am really thinking about going out to find my own band...On my own...I am sick of waiting...No one can quite seem to understand how much playing music means to me. Its my life...my everything...its i think the one thing in this world..that makes me truely happy...and keeps my sanity..Anyways...I have been getting into drums a lot more...Like...i wanted to get a guitar for my b day...but, its almost like i have lost intrest...its weird...Like, i still would love to get one...Just...ambition is gone...im not sure how or why...it just is...there was a time when, i hated drums....and i seriously thought id never pick up another drum stick again in my life...Yet...now i cant see it any other way...I still love bass and all...bass is fun...i dunno...i want to play bass in a band again...that would be fun...i also want to learn guitar better...yet...i just can not seem to get the whole picking thing down...and its pissing me off....Anyways....im a rambeling mess. hehe...oh well right ? well...im pretty tired..and...dont have much to say...so...ttyl kids...

"event","It's amazing the amount of emotional masochism I inflict upon myself. I'm hoping that one of these days it'll get old. And also, that I'll learn to stop thinking so fucking much about matters that don't need to be analyzed to death- and conversely, to put more thought into the things that DO matter instead of pushing them into the back of my mind in order not to deal with them...
   I haven't even really looked for a new job. I have $8 to my name. I've entirely given up on the hope that I'll have a place on my own before spring. Which causes me to rely on my friends for even longer... not that they haven't been super great about it. I think, more than anything else, I'm disappointed that I'm back at the starting gate. 
   I guess I hoped that once I got clean [well, off dope] everything would just start falling in place. Now that I'm aware of just how much work is necessary, and that life really doesn't owe me SHIT... I'm a little frazzled.
  So it goes.
  I'm trying to stay positive. But so many nights, I fall asleep with tears in my eyes out of sheer frustration. And will myself to try harder the next day. And...it becomes, once again, all talk.
  I've been seeing this guy for a few months, whom I absolutely adore. Who treats me very well, takes all my emotions in stride, and actually likes to hang out with my mom....and I've fallen in love with him. And it scares me. And I can't tell if I read too much into certain situations or if I really should be using caution. Days like today I feel as if I've invested too much emotionally and should just back out. Spare myself the disappointment. Then I remember how hard he always works to keep a smile on my face; and become confused. I keep wanting to tell him I love him; but I'm too afraid...Though his reaction could finally quell or confirm my fears and insecurities...
  I think I work too hard at keeping myself unhappy.
  On another note...
  I don't know, really. 
  Preoccupied on whether or not to make my life a little more difficult.
  I need to listen to some good and hard music, drink, and pretend that tonight I really am going to sit down and finally get back to my art..."

I've been on methadone since Sept.07. I used dope last Friday. But it's really a once-a-month- deal. Partially by choice, partially due to lack of money, & partially due to lack of real dealers (I've been ripped off 3 times in a row, in 3 different spots). I take it as a sign.
I've just started getting sick of taking methadone. I just want to pur this junkie-iem beinhd ne. Even though I know it'll always be a part of me....
I'm no longer living with my boyfriend, but I still see him every day. I'm currently living with this disgusting pig who can't go 5 minutes w/out making some sexual comment and grabss for my tits while ['m sleeping. Each day, I hate him more. He's stopped working out (not liking it was working it anyways), stopped going to school....he just sits around, all day, watching tv & eating, sending me text messages whining about how hw wants me to come home. It's sick. 
I've gained 13 pounds. And I'm stil a size 6. But that doesn't stop me form feeling like a fat-ass; I've NEVER weighed this miuch, nor had a stomach. Small things.
Modeling this weekend. Should be fun.
My flowers & gifts shop should be opening up next week. It's so beautiful- and damn near all of it is hand-made, and can be reproduced for a customer. There's also gonna me hand-painted pots, painrings, jewelry...anything goes. It's gonna be great- there's no way for it NOT to succeed, and it's a creative outlet. I can't wait for my baby to open.

Yes, losts of bad shit too. We weren't really getting along this week. But I talked to him last night. He was all fucked up. But he told me to call him tomorrow (today). But now he's fucking GONE. And I think he did it on purpose. He's had two extremely close calls before. Both times they revived him. This time.... he was really depressed. But he was gonna move out to L.A. in a few weeks to be with his girlfriend, who he was thinking about marrying. He told me 2 nights ago how depressed he was, that he just didn't want to live anymore. I don't think he went into this with the intention of ""Ha, I'm going to overdose!"" I think he subconsciously knew what it might do to him and just didn't fucking care anymore. His parents found him at his apartment this morning.
I'm just shell-shocked right now. The Klonopin may have something to do with it. 
I'm so, so....sad. I'm so hurt. It's a physical pain...I can feel my heart breaking. I have this void in my chest. Him and I were talking a few weeks ago about how we wanted to know eachother for the rest of our lives. How important we were to eachother. 
And last night, I was mad at him when we talked on the phone. God...I TALKED TO HIM HOURS BEFORE HE DIED. I don't know what to do. 
Once I come out of shell-shock, I know I'm going to have an extremely bad nervous breakdown. I'm going to completely lose it. I'm going to go fucking insane. I just lost one of the most important people in my life.
Because of drugs.
I need to go to rehab. I need to stop doing drugs. I dont' want to be next.
I'm so lost. I'm so sad. I just want to hole up somewhere....

However, this week I'm working both jobs. No easy task. I will most likely resort to tears midweek. I'll just reward myself with drugs, most likely.
    I've cut down. Well, with the exception of Friday when I did ridiculous amounts. Other than that, my heroin use is down. I'm trying to prepare myself to quit, which I am planning on doing next week. I went 48 hours without using last weeks. Considering I get sick 12 hours after not using, that's pretty good. But NO FUN. I'm just so sick of using. And have no veins left. I was 30 minutes late to work yesterday cuz I couldn't find a vein. So that's where I draw the line. Enough is enough.
   Confusion reigns. 
   And my skin has started breaking out again, cuz of the heroin. Eyes sunken in, awful bags under my eyes. Not painting a pretty picture. Basically, I'm starting to look like a junkie. Which is funny, because I still wear makeup, still dress nicely. I don't know. I think I just need to get my act together.

It makes me look so...polished. Clean. (ha ha) I like it. It's a huge change, since I'd been been doing reds or purples for like 5 years. I just wish changing other things could be just as easy...
     I may be moving in a couple weeks. Just down the street, but a much bigger apartment. It's huge, and really nice. And the 3 guys that lived there before got evicted, so they left all these cds, which I of course pilfered. Scored some cds I never would've payed for but don't mind owning. 
     Went to the skate park yesterday with a friend of mine. He was teaching me how to do smoother turns, and we were just playing around. I was pretty confident, since I'm not doing too bad for having been on a skateboard only a handful of times. I wanted to do this really small drop. So he showed me what I should so once I was to do really do it. So I went for it. This may also be the time to mention I was high so my coordination was a little off. It started off alright-but then, I don't know what I did- but I flipped off the board. I know how to fall, so I tried to land it so I wouldn't do too much damage. I now have a huge bruise on my left thigh. I deided to try it again. A little better. But I jumped off the board when I felt like I was gonna fall. So the skateboard crashed into my ankle and it's a bit swollen. But it was fun. I'd do it again.
     But......
     My friend that I went with- I'm attracted to him. We met because he started talking to me, we hit it off. Hung out. He got married about a month ago. After we were done at the skatepark, we decided to go hit up the beach which was right there. I borrowed shorts from him and we went. He picked me up and carried me out into the water, occasionally dipping me in. It was fun. The water was cold. Then the lifeguard tells us to come in. Apparently we were swimming at the dog beach. Woof.
    So we were sitting out in the sun, smoking cigarettes, and I was freezing. So we got closer so he could keep me warm. And closer. And started kissing....
    Bad, bad, bad. We both cannot do this. We didn't talk about it. I had to leave to get my hair done, so he just dropped me off back home.......
   I feel bad for not feeling bad. I don't feel guilty for it. And it makes me wonder...I feel as if I'm happy with my boyfriend. I do love him. But there must be something wrong, if I can do this....And there's more.
    While I was getting my hair done, this really cute girl walked in, getting her hair done as well. She was gorgeous. My friend's girlfriend owns the salon, and she was the one doing my hair. She was doing this girl's hair too. So when we were done, I got invited out for a drink with them. And this girl and I talked. And really hit it off. And I'm so drawn in by her. The chemistry is amazing. She asks for my number.
    I go over to my friend's house with him & his girlfriend. We're gonna grill some food, & this girl said she's gonna stop by in about an hour. I find out she has a girlfriend.... So she comes by, and we're talking. And I can't take me eyes off her...we leave at the same time, talk for a minute. 
   But I don't know, since she has a girlfriend. Oh, yeah, and I have a BOYfriend. But it was so hard to not touch her face, or kiss her...
   Why am I having all these feelings when I do really care about the person that I'm with???
   I don't know what it is that I'm doing. I'm a mess. Everything is so confusing. And this living a double life thing is getting to be too much. It's so sad, to me, to be this polished, professional person at work who's just thinking about how glad I am that I get to wear long sleeves to cover my track marks....I don't know what to do. It's frustrating. I want to be clean without being dopesick. I want to be addict that never runs out of drugs and is still a functional memeber of society. I want to be happy without being disillusioned.
    Right.
    I don't know.
    Was sort of in a fight with my boyfriend last night. I want him to call me so we can just resolve it and move on.
    Why does everything have to be this difficult?"

    I'm more smug about the fact that it was so easy to get a new job than I am happy that I have a new job. Or will as of Thursday when I go to Orientation. And I may start Friday. Which means that I'll need to just up and quit my job. Haha. 
    Six days clean. And counting. I'm just wondering how long I can keep that for. I think the reason it's been easy (aside from the shitty ass withdrawl I went through) is because I haven't really been stressing it. It was a spontaneous ""I'm gonna stop,"" and just did it. I'd been contemplating it, but that step felt like the equivalent of ""I think I'm gonna have pizza for dinner."" 
   So is it irresponsible for me to walk into my job tomorrow, on my day off, and go, ""Hey, sorry, but tomorrow is gonna be my last day""?
I really don't think that he deserves any better treatment.

Of course I showed up. FUCKING ASSHOLE. ASSHOLE ASSHOLE ASSHOLE. Though I have to admit, I do understand why he's upset with me. I would be too. I have not been the best employee. But he's so fucking unprofessional, so immature. It's the way he handles situations, I think, that makes him such a fucking prick. Ah well. I wanted a new job anyways. It looks like I'm gonna get this job at the Hard Rock Hotel (gift shop, but hey); set up by a friend of mine. Not crazy about their hours of operation, but---I'll start off at a dollar more per hour than I'm making now, and after 3 months I get full health benefits. So fuck you Mr. Boss! Ha! Asshole. 
   Finally not dopesick anymore. Well, I still feel sick first thing in the morning, but I'm fine otherwise. It's cool. Because I chose to stop. I just decided to take a break. Granted, it's not like I can afford to be doing it now anyways, but I don't even want to. That doesn't mean I won't relapse. But, just for today, my thoughts will be on not using....ah yes. It feels good to go through multiple days not high. 
   Dammit what the hell why does everyone fucking suck so much that they can't pick up their damn phones when i'm fucking flipping out goddamn in consistent bastards all of you!
   I hate this. And that really good Ben & Jerry's ice-cream is at my boyfriend's. Sonofawhore. At least I have a Heath bar.
   Fine. I'm just gonna stop picking up my phone from now on when people call me. I'm not gonna be there for ANYONE if none of these fuckers can be here for me.

   I'm so fucked.
   Had to borrow $100 from one of the girls I work with to go to the doctor yesterday. Left work to go to  sliding-scale Planned Parenthood down on the west side (my boyfriend went with me). For those who know Chicago: Chicago and Central. Way west, way in the ghetto, way in the middle of dope spots. Got checked up: I have a U.T.I., and another infection from that. Ugh. Three meds.
  So I'd been shooting up at home. My boyfriend wouldn't let me do it around him. So I did it myself. And liked it. Then I ran out of dope. Then my mom found my needles. I said they were old. She found them yesterday. I tried but did not succeed in getting heroin yesterday. My track marks are healing. And... I'M SO FUCKING DOPESICK I WANT TO KILL SOMEONE. 
   That's really why I called in at work. I felt so sick, I could barely stand. I slept from noon til 4:30 today on top of the sleep I got last night. And I feel so fuckin desperate...
   I said Wednesday that I was gonna stop doing it, for at least a while. And obviously I'm supposed to be...
   But it hurts. It hurts it got this far, worse than ever really. It hurts that I'm nothing but a goddamn junkie. It hurts that I'm a fucking failure. I just feel so fucking DESPERATE.

But I don't want to deal with any of the old drama that went on before. Refuse to be the middle man, and the scapegoat. I told them both this. But I really don't think it's gonna work out. Cuz our friend is just gonna end up back on heroin, again, due to me and/or my boyfriend. It's just a matter of time. He's been a junkie for almost 10 years. And if he's ever around us while we're high (though we won't do it in front of him), he'll want to get back on. I won't be responsible.
   Though at this point I myself am so fuckin sick of heroin. Sick of being used by a damn drug. Just read about this shit called Ibogaine- it sounds interesting. Half like a crock of shit, yet half credible because it comes froma plant and has been used for centuries. Maybe I'm just skeptical cuz one of the articles I read about it sounded like it was written by a fuckin hippie. And if there's one thing I hate, it's godddamn hippies.

   Was out of cigarettes by the time I got home. So at 2:45, I went to try to get a pack. Wearing my pj's, a bandana, Chucks, and no ID. First place, a bar; the machine ate my money. Secong place: couldn't go in cuz of dress code. Third: Closed. Fourth: Closed. I harassed 2 drunk guys to go get them from this gay leather bar by my house. They were assholes about it. And didn't give me my change. But at least, after 45 minutes and lots of crying, I got my cigarettes.

    My boyfriend and I are fairly well. There's a bit of drama- shit he finally fessed up to from our past relationship that I don't know if I can get over. But other than that, it's fabulous.
    So I went to the dope spot a couple days ago- to pick up gear for me as well as a favor for someone else that I don't know very well. And...of COURSE.....they didn't have any, tried a different spot and..... GOT RIPPED OFF. Now. Losing my own money fuckin sucks cuz I was gonna drop a bit of it.

     For some reason, I can't talk on my phone anymore. I think I've just been too weak to attempt to hold a phone conversation. I just don't pick up my phone the majority of the time. Unless I need to arrange a meeting time with someone. Even then, I usually just bail.

    Neubauten is on Friday!!
    Had a confrontation with someone who I considered my best friend yesterday about that shit he said to me when he was all fucked up last week. Turns out when he went to the emergency room Thursday night, he had almost 40 time-released Xanax in his system and I think at least 1/2 a gram of almost pure heroin in his system. Fucking idiot. IDIOT. He always blacks out when he takes Xanax ( I think we all do). But he said a few weeks ago he never wanted to take it again cuz of that time we hung out all day after taking Xanax and he didn't remember any of it. He even slept with some bitch that night and doesn't remember. He said he only remembers taking 2 Xanax. He works as desk clerk for the building he lives in (and that his dad OWNS)- and apparently he was so fucked up Thursday (he started taking drugs Wednesday evening), that he was downstairs, not even behind the front desk, with his pants around his ankles talking incoherently to building tenants... Okay, that last part is fucking funny. 
   But none of that exuses the shit he said to me- that I'm a crackwhore, that I'm gonna end up sucking dick at the Greyhound station for hits of rock. Among lots of other things. So fuck that. I don't know. I was at my boyfriend's house when I told him all the things he said to me; I needed support. But he laughed at first- and I snapped, and started screaming at him. About how it wasn't funny, about fucked up it was.... He kept apologizing. Asked if I was gonna break our friendship because of this. I told him he did the damage. Quoting him: ""I'll make it up to you, just let me make it up to you. I'll buy you flowers or something."" 
Yeah.
Part of me is so sad that this all had to happen. Because regardless of the fact that he's a pathological liar, and a sociopath, that he's talked shit about me behind my back-- we've been through so much...damamge with eachother. We've kept eachother ALIVE for the past 4 years. But I can't shake this. It just brings back memories, very bad ones, from something that happened 2 years ago..something he did to me that he didn't remember doing (and didn't know he did until a few months ago), and the damage that that did to me...and I forgave him for it. But now... I don't know if I can weather this. And it hurts, it does. Because he's really got 2 personalities. The one that I love so much- and then there's the part of him that's a fucking monster..
  Sidenote:: my bank account has been negative for months. Then they randomly took of half the amount I owed them, and froze the account so I wouldn't get charged any more fees. That was pretty cool; I didn't even know that they froze my account til a few minutes ago when I called my bank. I needed to know what was gonna happen to my tax refund, since I did a direct deposit. Turns out, by some strange ethereal mathematics.. I will end up with $129 that is MINE, not THEIRS!!! So I somehow get my account fixed, and have extra money that I desperately needed as I only had $20 left til I got paid again next week... Ah, how can people doubt that there is someone looking out for each of us... Well, I thank my kindred spirit...
   Back to my dilemma.
   I don't know whether to say ""Sorry, we can't be friends anymore."" or ""I will never forget this- but our friendship has gotten past so much more, I'm willing to look past this.""
   I don't think, in this case, it's a matter of what the ""right"" decision is. It really is up to me. No one can make this decision for me. Nor can anyone convince me that one holds more weight than the other. My boyfriend tried to help me make a decision last night, by helping me think of every pro and every con.
   I think I have to see him in person. Though I may beat the fuck out of him. I have hit him before in anger, a long long time ago, so he knows I'm capable, and can cause damage...No, that's not the right thing to do.
  He asked if we were still on for the show on Friday. I said I don't know. An ex-boyfriend of mine called me last night, said we should meet up for the show, and that he wants me to meet his girlfriend. I hold no animosity towards him- we make much better friends than we do lovers. I would like to meet her. But he's also gonna be with the friend that I'm not talking to. Oh- I have his ticket for the show. He paid for both out tickets, but I have them. And he brought that up to my ex. I'm thinking of being a bitch and telling him that I gave him his ticket that night over a month ago when he crashed at my house. He was drunk, he won't know for sure. My boyfriend does need a ticket for the show.... no, no, I can't. Right? I shouldn't? 
   My body hurts. 
   Damn, I just realized that the money posts in my account tomorrow. So I can't access it til Wednesday. Fuck. Oh well. Dammit, and I'm off tomorrow. Better for me, I guess. I'd probably do something stupid like spend it on drugs. When I really need shoes and more pants. Not like there's that much I can do with $129. I should just save it- so next paycheck I can do some shopping. I think I'll need a new debit card, too, if my account was frozen. I don't even know where my old one is, honestly. 
   Babble babble babble.
   I should make myself more presentable for work, as I was just gonna go looking like shit. Damn. Time for makeup...

    Saw a friend of mine yesterday that I haven't seen in a while' he stopped by my work. He's one of those people that I rarely see but still consider a good friend.
   My boy's exgirlfiend came up to the city yesterday with some guy she knows to hang out. I've known her for as long as I've known him. She's alright. I mentioned her before- the trashy one, the party favour. I have a decent time with her; just something about her rubs me the wrong way. And she always feels the need to bring up shit with him that I really don't want to hear; about times they fucked, or similar things. It's just to irritate me, I think. Jealousy. He doesn't help; telling her things about how her tits are hanging out. I don't know. He says thigs about how he really doesn't like her, how she's annoying, then he goes in the bathroom and locks the door to call her while I'm just left to sit in his couch.

   So tired. Have gotten a total of about 14 hours of sleep, total, in the past 3 nights.
    Don't get me wrong. I had a beautiful monday night. Tuesday and last night are two different stories, though. last night........
    Hung out with my friend that I got in that argument with a couple days ago. We discussed everything rationally. Had a really good conversation. It was interesting. I felt bad, though-oh, nevermind.
    Boyfriend then picked me up. We hung out at his house. Had a good time, but he seemed preoccupied. And didn't want to talk about what was bothering him..... 
    A friend of mine had texted me earlier last night, telling me his heart was broken. He wouldn't explain it, except to say that I shoulf call him later and that it had something to do with something I said to him. So I called him around 2 a.m., when I got home. He was drunk. He automatically started going off on me for ""hanging out with"" my ex. He doesn't know we're actually together now. Then he starting going crazy- talking about how I'm gonna end up a junkie whore in a couple months, sucking dick for a hit of rock. Oh, and this would be after my ex ditched, because I didn't know that he despises me. And I was only with him because I'm lonely and I want him to stick his dick in me and tell me everything is gonna be okay. This is all from my ""best friend""s mouth. Oh- I forgot to mention that this is the one I slept with about a month ago......
   I think I hurt him in ways I didn't even know  I could hurt him.
   He said all that, and so much more. I was crying because I was so mad. When I was responding, I was talking through such clenched teeth I almost sounded like I was hissing responses back. It was bad. I told him I hated him right then. I told him he was an asshole. He just kept talking about how I was gonna die and that he wouldn't come to my funeral... but he also atarted talking about how he wishes it could just be me & him again, how he just wants to take me out to dinner....it was sad. I would've felt so guilty for hurting him this much if he hadn't ripped my heart in two last night......I don't know. He was almost in tears, and I WAS crying... it was all so unbelievably sad and fucked up and straight out of a movie....tried texting him tonight to tell him that we should meet in person. But he didn't respond. I think I just want to punch him in the face and then proceed to apologize for hurting him and letting him know how I really feel about him, and then tell him I never want to talk to him again if he really feels about me what he expressed last night. Lord, I don't know.
   I think my drug use is getting out of control, has been out of control. But I don't know if the guilt part outweighs the apathetic part. Or which really requires more energy.
   Oh-and to a certain someone- don't feel like you accomlish anything. You got me to listen, and think. Who's voice do you think pops into my head during moments of weakness of which kind you know I'm referring to...thank you for taking time to try and help me...

All my own fault, of course.
    Okay. So heroin's a very manipulative drug. I know this. So I don't know if how I feel about it right now is really how I feel or the drug/my subconscious trying to trick me.... Realistically, I know that since I'm using at all I'm NOT ok, no matter what I want to think. This I know. But I don't have the drive, the ambition, to stop myself from getting sucked up in its claws. Everyone I know tells me that I'm one of the strongest people they've ever met. Well, I don't fucking see it, I don't feel it. I'm so self-deprecating, that there's no way for me to dig myself out of this whole. I've set it up where I'm fucked no matter what. And I'm not sure I like it...
   I don't like the fact that I've lost one friend already due to how I choose to live my life. She flipped out yesterday because I told her I'm now really dating that guy. I ended the conversation with ""Fuck you"" and hung up on her. I feel guilty. But she has no right to say anything about my choices when she's still with a guy that calls her a dumb whore to her face and refusing to admit that he's with her to his friends... 
   And someone else, too. Who means a lot to me, though I've never expressed it. He was there when I first started N.A. He became a quick friend, and I really respected him. Smart, funny, very down to earth. He was also one of the few people who could really get through to me, even without saying much at all. And I think he's given up in me. Or, rather, chooses not to talk to me because I'm starting to steadily use again. Hon, you know who you are- I understand. But it makes me sad. And it makes me realize what kind of ultimatum I've set up for myself. But I DON't KNOW HOW TO DO IT...
   I read the first step the other night. I don't know if I wrote about this. But it really fucked with my head. I'd never actually sat there, and read it. And I even took out my highlighter... the way some of the things were worded just hit straight to the heart.
   THEN WHY DOES IT SEEM THAT NOTHING EVER MAKES A DIFFERENCE?
   I don't let myself really care that I'm falling into old patterns. Sort of. I'm more weary. More expectant of what will happen if I continue to use dope. But I also feel differently about it now. I do. I see it differently. But that doesn't mean shit. Dunno.

    Confession time. 
    Went with my ex last night to go score. And we did. Got dope, and rocks. The heroin must've been bunk- or just really weak and cut with too much of the sleeping pills they usually cut it with because I didn't even get high. And I should've been. My ex even slammed 6 bags and felt nothing. The rocks did get me high for a bit- but not really. I don't understand why I enjoyed it so much before. I'd been looking forward to it the whole car ride home (well, to his place), as I hadn't smoked rocks in about 4 months... But... I don't know. I think I hadn't really been in the mood- it was just there. Which is SO FUCKING STUPID. But...at the same time... I'm so glad. And it was interesting- I didn't even care. I wasn't upset that I wasn't high. Any time before, I would've flipped out. I don't even really want any right now. I'm just sick of it. Sick of heroin. Sick of being a drug addict. It's just...it's getting disgusting to me. Watching me ex try to find a vein, blood running down his arm from all the failed attempts. At the time, while I was watchimg him do it, IT FELT ALMOST NORMAL. To watch him do this. To watch him get blood on his tee-shirt, to watch him drop the tourniquet...but then on my way home- it hit me. This morning, it hit even harder. 
   And I snapped. And couldn't stop crying. For all the things that have become commonplace that should never be. For all the time I've lost. For all the pain. For all the days of dope-sickness, for wanting to just let it kill me. For the fact that I can't take it anymore. When I think about doing heroin again, I just get sick to my stomach. It makes me fucking sick. 
   If I do it again, it will either kill me or make me go crazy. Now I know this. 
   I just pray I feel this way for everyday forward.
   I want to be okay. In response to a question posed to me, you know who you are- I think that, yes, I am ready to do whatever it takes. 
I think. 
    I know I have enough of a support system. And if I had the money, I would check myself into rehab right now. I would hop on a train and GO.
    Dammit, so much more I want to write but it's late and I need sleep. 
   And listening to a song that always makes me cry- Les Nubians, ""Amour a Mort."" I think everyone should check out this song. An english translation should be available, or I can just write one out. But I don't think it would have anywhere near the same impact in English.
   So I'm a trilingual artist/writer who works in retail and is a junkie whore. Nice. That's a life wasted right there.
   I wish to rant about the demise of the U.S. in terms of expressing its socio-political views, but there's an overriding laziness on my part. Let's just say it involves a pack of matches I was given that said ""Let freedom light the way"" on it. And how you Americans love your fucking paperwork. So many papers to fill out when you want to do anything. It's irritating. 
    The rants will ensue tomorrow. Well, if all goes as planned for tomorrow, probably not til Monday....
    Speaking of tomorrow- I was supposed to go to a show with my ex tomorrow. But he didn't pick up his phone tonight. So he's probably really fucked up. And at his parents' house in the suburbs, since they're out of town. And he's probably fucking his ex-girlfriend, as she lives a suburb over. They're still friends. And she's such a fucking slut- such a wannabe Jersey-girl whore. White trash. In that my parents are loaded and I'm pretty so I'm gonna become a crack whore sort of way. Don't get me wrong, she's nice. But a friend of mine described her the best: ""She's a party favor."" It's not animosity because she's an ex; I just hate girls like her. I see them at my work all the time, and it kills me to have to be nice to them.
No offense to anyone, but... white girls should not be allowed to wear hoop earings, much less those huge ones. It's trashy and never looks good. EVER. 
   I should just stop talking to my ex. ""People, places, and things.""
   I'm going to go read the basic text. 
   I've said far too much."

"event","Left a message on my mom's boyfriend's answering machine today. I'm taking steps to be nice to this man. Etta James is coming here, so I told him to surprise my mom with tickets. And speak of the devil, they just came back here...he has a terrible haircut...
   So cold.
   Still very emotional. Praying the morning after pill worked. Gonna take a pregnancy test next week just to make sure... God, I need to stop getting myself in these sort of situations...
   My dealer wants me to become his business partner. 
   A friend of mine crossed the line the other day and made me really upset. We take pictures; we're starting a fetish site, and I'm his main model (he's a photographer, not just some amateur). So, granted, he's seen me with my clothes off. But it was never sexual. I'm sure thoughts crossed his mind a few times, but that's normal- but he never made any comments. Which was great. But then earlier this week, when I was just hanging out with him at his work, he kept on trying to get me to take off my shirt. Just cuz he wanted to see my tits. I kept saying no, but he kept bugging me.... it was just completely inappropriate. And he's 11 years older than I am, so I thought he was more mature than that... and he lives with his girlfriend... I'm just so fucking disappointed. So many people in my life have dicked me over, or at least attempted to. And I get so tired of fucking dealing with it...
   Talked to my mom last night about my father. I was brutally honest about how I feel about him. I told her I will probably never forgive him for the things he's done to me. That I think he's very emotionally disturbed. That he's an asshole. And an immature idiot. 
How I wish she'd left him years ago but I'm glad she finally did it regardless. How I AM slightly envious that my little sister is his favorite- that she's never gotten a spanking, much less the full on beatings I got for years, coupled with verbal abuse...
   And, dammit, it was so fucking nice having the courage to actually say all these things to my mother. For us to talk about it. I was telling my sister about it later that night; she said she wouldn't have the courage to say those things, that she's not ready yet. But I also know that I hold a lot more anger towards him, which makes it easier.... 
    So much shit on my mind.
    Want drugs. But I'm on my fourth day sober, after an almost 3 week binge. And it's so fucking hard. My friend wants me to go to her house and do shots with her and her boyfriend, but I don't know if I want to. Nor do I know if I'll be able to say no. It may not seem like a big deal to most people, to do a couple shots-- but I know there are a few out there who really understand why it's so detrimental. How it will only set off me doing drugs again.
    Which is why I should NOT agree to partner up with my dealer.
    A friend of mine told me yesterday that she's convinced I lack any sort of conviction. 
    So so cold. I don't know how much is external, and how much is internal. 
   Wait, that sounds really quasi-teen-goth-whatever. Ugh. Thirteen yr. old ""goth"" kids really irritate me. I see them at my work all the time. I want to tell them to go home to their mothers until they are capable of understand what ANYTHING means. Especially any specific lifestyle.
   I think I want to start seeing a shrink again. May do me some good. Or maybe I'll just get another asshole who doesn't understand me and makes an ass out of the both of us. Maybe I need a female shrink. No, I hate females. I am ashamed of my gender. Petty, trivial things women are. 
   Must go eat to sustain life."

   Feel like a cheap, junkie whore. Useless and a drain of resources.
   Can't deal with what I'm doing to my body. 
   Cutting everyone important out of my life and replacing them with people who help in my self-destruction.
   Want desperately to stop being a stupid asshole.
   I'm so fucking blind to the obvious. A friend of mine pointed out tonight how much I recently probably hurt a friend of mine without even thinking about it. But as he's a non-confrontational bastard who doesn't express his real emotions, I didn't consider his emotions. So vague, but details take too long.
   Sick of this lifestyle. 
   Want meaningful sex.
   Want to recreationally drink and nothing more.
   Want to smile and really mean it.
   Want to save up money so I can actually but the things I need, like a new jacket. And shoes. And comforter. And pants. And a plane ticket to Massachusetts. And ones for L.A. and Montana as well. Oh, and New York. 
   Want to stop being SUCH A DRAMA MAGNET. Sick of it.
   I'm sorry to everyone and anyone I've ever hurt. And I want to forgive all those who have hurt me. (Except my father. That one will stay buried in hate for now.)
   All I can do is cry and cry right now.
   At least I went to an N.A. meeting today, for the first time in a very long time. Talk about a reality check.
   And I'm home all alone. I hate being home alone. Years of drug use has led to massive paranoia. That, and I'm just so...sad... right now. I want someone to tell me it's alright. 
   Can't call anyone; everyone'll be pissed off if I call them this late.
   Need to be up in 7 hours. Want to go to bed but I can't.
   My throat hurts from all the screaming I was doing earlier when I just couldn't take it anymore, when it all hurt too much to hold it back any longer.
   I really was happy for a while. I was doing so well.
   And then I fuckin relapsed. And everything turned to shit. It's no fucking coincidence, at least I realized that....

So computer is slow as hell, programs will suddenly become non-responsive, can't run multiple programs (which is all I do). AND, AND, MY PRINTER WON'T WORK. My friend is writing a book, an she sent me a draft. There's a whole section about me. And I can't even fucking print it out. Sonofawhorecuntbitch.
    Speaking of books my friends are writing-- two of my friends are writing books. Incidentally, I am in both. And so far, from what I've read, they're both depressing as hell. Both involve me losing myself to heroin. God, it's so sad- everything I do in my life, and this is what people remember about me. I guess because it's most visibly affected me. I just want to do something GOOD for people to remember, to even fucking write about. I don't know... (sidenote: and this Pink Floyd song really depresses me- ""Wish You Were Here."" A couple years ago, as my friends and I were walking to my friend's funeral, this is what someone was singing. And then everyone starting joining in...but I can't turn it off...i'm not even a big pink floyd fan) 
    I had my first sober night in about 17 days last night. I stared drinking a beer, but I only got about half through it and realized that I just really didn't want to get inebriated, at all. Well, I need to explain last night...
   Hung out with my ex. Again. Went there straight after work, cuz I was gonna get him some coke and heroin from my dealer. He had been taking a nap, so we both just went to sleep. I tried calling my dealer twice, but he wasn't picking up...called him again when I woke up, around 9 p.m. And he was like, ""Oh, I wasn't able to get what you wanted."" When the motherfucker had told me earlier that day that he had it, that it would be no problem. What kind of dealer cna't come through with drugs, I don't fuckin know... So I was really hungry, so we went to my dad's fast food place that he opened about a month or so ago. Free cheeseburgers.. He's in FLorida with my little sister, which is the only reason I went- let's just say there's a little problem with a restraining order against him... Go back to my friend's house to eat it. So we're sitting there, eating, watching Sid & Nancy. And he's like, ""Fuck, I want dope."" I told him we should go get some, then. At our usual spot, they don't serve that late (It was 11:30, I think.) he said the only place he knew we could defintely score that late was in the projects. For those who know Chicago: a little south of Comiskey (exuse me, U.S. Cellular Field).... so not a good spot for two white kids at close midnight at this point. We're pulling into the parking lot of this one housing, and he says to watch out for cops. So we both look ahead of us--and he says- ""Like those. Fuck."" 
    Cops straight in front of us.
    We couldn't just reverse and peel out. So we pulled into the parking lot anyways, to try to reverse and leave- and he parks perpendicular to us, so we're trapped in. We haven't scored yet- but he did have a crack pipe in the car... We look at eachother...
   He cop slams on his window. He says ""What the fuck do you think you're doing? Do you think I'm an idiot and didn't see you?"" Bad, bad start. I don't even have my ID on me- I left it as his house.
   He asks, again, what we were doing. Flashlight right in our faces. My friend says we were lost. The cop goes nuts. (His bitch partner was just standing by my window, flashing her flashlight in my window.)
He starts screaming about how we're lying, how we should go ahead and lie again cuz he'll just cart us off to jail right there and impound my friend's car. So he tries again, the cop: ""You're here to get blows, aren't you."" So my ex nods his head. Cop: ""How many?"" Ex: ""Six."" Cop turns to me: ""You do dope too?"" Me: ""Sometimes."" I guess that was the wrong answer, cuz he asks us for our IDs. I pissed him off again when I didn't have it- I offered to give him my social security number so he could run it through the system. Wrong answer again- cuz that showed I've had run-ins before, considering I knew how it worked. He asked where I lived- I said the north side. (I wasn't trying to be a goddamn smartass, I said that after he noticed my friend's ID said he was from Deerfield) So he goes back in his car. Comes back a few minutes later. (His partner had already gone back to the car.) Asks my ex, ""Are you dopesick?"" He nods his head, trying to look sad- cuz it's bullshit, we just wanted to get high.. The cop: ""Then go be dopesick at home. This is no place for you. If I see you or your sweetie-pie  around here again, I will take your asses to jail and impound your car. Now get the fuck out of here."" 
Gets in his car, follows us til we get back on the expressway- and we've already started laughing, trying to make sure he didn't see us.... He made fun of my scarf: it's fuzzy and colorful- the cops made a crack about how I thought I was precious with my boa. He thought I was wearing a fucking feather boa, at midnight on a monday, in the projects. I'm not fucking stupid. Nor do I wear feather boas... 
   So you think that near-jail experience would've stopped us. Especially since my ex recently got charges dropped for possession. But nope. We tried another spot. No one was out. So we go back to his house. Sit around, watch tv, he drinks more beer. I go home.
   I HATE COPS. Though I have to admit- I'm glad we got out of there. Not like there was much he could've charged us with. I was scared- but it was more adrenaline than anything. 
    I don't know. 
    I'm suppposed to be in the shower, as I need to be out of my house in 30 minutes to start my day. Not gonna happen. I need to run all over the city today, it sucks. It's my only day off this week, so I need to make as much out of it as possible...
    Updates later. If I'm not puking, as I'm gonna go pick up the morning after pill, though it's been some time at this point.. oh well, it's cheaper than raising a child.....

     For the first time in a while, I have NOTHING TO DO. There isn't a damn thing I need to do, nowhere to be. I could clean the house. I could take a shower. I could do plenty to things- but everything can wait. Wait, I really should clean my room. I can't even find any of my clothes anymore, they've just merged into this giant pile of assorted fabric. 
    For someone with OCD, I sure as hell can't keep my bedroom clean....
     Okay. So tonight I want to stay away from anything that may cause any sort of inebriation. It's been too many nights, my body wants a respite. 
    I need to the morning after pill. It's been 48 hours. Well, like 36. Regardless..... I'm pertty sure I'm sterile or at least very unfertile. Between the amount of drugs I've done and still sometimes do, and all the problems I've had with my uterus, I think I""m pretty safe. But I'm not willing to take that risk. Especially since he just found out that his brother's girlfriend is pregnant... I'm not worried about the STD business, as it's my ex and I know we're both clean. I jsut wish we'd both been more responsible. Granted, we should've used a condom, but I wish he'd at least given me a warning or asked if he should pull out... oh well, what's done is done. 
   I've been such a whore for the past month. I've messed around with more people than I have in at least the last 2 years. I'm not trying to make myself sound bad- it's just I've been very conservative in the sex/messing around department for a while, and I've completely hacked that to pieces. I was having chocolate martinis last night with my best friend- and his response was ""It happens to everyone in their 20s. Enjoy it. Just be careful."" 
   Hmm.... 
   Just want to be loved, to feel needed. To be held and kissed. To be listened to. I just always feel so alone. That's the other thing he and I were talking about yesterday; this whole principle on being able to feel so alone even while you're sitting across the table from someone else. He's been really depressed as of recently- well, he's always unhappy. He hates himself just as much as any other eclectic, bipolar jumkie does. Admitted he was a sociopath. At least he's the functional kind. Unlike some other people I know. Manipulative bastards, those sociopaths...
   Hanging out with my ex again. Even though he's doing great- clean, even stopped smoking cigarettes recently- I'm doubtful. He's a really sweet person, good soul- but he's just really fucked in the head. I'm not trying to be mean. He's one of those people than doesn't even realize how paranoid he can be; as well as manipulating, selfish, unjust, hurtful, illogical.... It's so hard to watch him try to battle his demons. Because I see his moments where he's just sucha good guy. Caring, considerate, funny, giving, unbelievably loving... But it all depends on when you catch him. And I don't want to deal with that. Shit, I don't even want to date again- I'm just talking about friendship. When we were together, we were both just doing too many drugs. Everything was just dysfunction, lack of trust, no communication....It's all too hard to explain; why I even still talk to him... I'm too nice...
     Restless. Want to leave the house but don't know where to go. And it's so fucking cold out. 
     Lonely. Want someone to come keep me company...."

All the heroin I've done has killed all my pain receptors so my pain threshhold is way down. At least for accidental pain- things like piercings and getting bitten still feel really good.... 
    This morning, I was headed back home after taking my little sister to school for my mom. Fell asleep on the bus. I was curled up into a ball in the back of the bus, wearing my ugly coat and my hat that says ""NY Chinatown."" I think the bus driver thought I was homeless. All I know is, we were both startled when I woke up to him shaking my leg- and I almost kicked him and said ""Huh? Where am I?"" Totally confused. He asked me if I needed a transfer- really nice guy, really. Luckily, the end of the route was only 2 1/2 blocks from my house, so I just staggered back home to get ready for work. It was 9:30 a.m. For those who know me and have seen me when I'm just woken up, I'm either extremely confused or extremely angry. Sometimes both. So it's really a funnier story if you know me, I guess.. I don't know. But I really don't like being made to feel like a degenerate of society by doing things like falling asleep on the CTA after having passed out the night before with Xanax lovingly running through my veins, as it is once again tonight...
   I'm a bit of a controlled mess right now.
   I've been gaining weight and it fucking sucks. I'm still a little below average weight for my height, but dammit, I don't like having a tummy and first time lovehandles....
   Off the point.
   HEROIN SUCKS. I am now out of Xanax and dope. So tomorrow, for the first time in, oh, 15 or 16 days, I'll have to be sober, all day and all night. I don't know if I can handle. Cuz it's been vodka, coke, heroin, and Xanax for over 2 weeks. I need a break. I WANT A BREAK. 
   Wish to be okay. But I know that even if I stop using, that urge will always be there... and it fucking sucks, because I've made a mess out of my life that I can never completely fix. I will always be this unhappy.

   Now that that's out of the way...
   My mom just (accidently) punched me in my industrial piercing. It's fully healed, but still new enough where that shit fucking hurts. Oh well. Nothing like an old-fashioned wake up call of pain.
   So.
   I had what I like to refer to as my ""fucking epiphany"" a little over a month ago. I was walking back home at 8:30 in the morning, half-asleep, when it suddenly hit me: I've been victimizing myself for years. That I've been manipulating myself into believing that I've been unjustly wronged for years. Well- THAT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT. God, I've spent so much time really believing that I'd done NOTHING WRONG. That people just set out to hurt me. But now.. I accept the fact that the only person I can blame for the vast majority of what has happened to me is.... MY OWN FAULT. How people have treated me, my drug addiction, the fact that I still haven't gone to college, why I work a shitty retail job... 
    I'm writing about it now because I've even more recently (in the last week) realized the implications of my ""fucking epiphany."" Just realizing wasn't enough emotional damage, as it turned out. Now I have to review everything in my head and flip it around to at least SOME basis in reality and pinpoint where I could've changed the situation, where it was MY fault. And it FUCKS WITH YOUR HEAD. BADLY.
    I just don't know. I don't know how to feel. Because all of a sudden, I feel like everything I've thought is WRONG. And, on a certain level, it IS. And it makes me want to both break down, and...breathe. Because maybe, now, I'll lead a slightly less fucked up life. Get in less situations where I AM the victim, but only because I allowed myself to be put there. I think that it both makes my life and the way I am make MORE sense, but also throws everything through a fucking loop. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. 
    However---
    I refuse to think that there are some situations that are my fault. Because, granted, we someimes put ourselves in bad situations- but that doesn't mean we deserve what happens or what is done to us. I refuse to believe that. If nothing else, it does give me some solace- because things have happened to me that I WILL NOT put blame on myself for. That would just fucked up and unfair.... 
   Moving on.
   I don't know. That's really all I can say. ""that which does not kill us only makes us stronger"" 
   only half the time is that true. the other half of the time, it's just slowly breaking down our spirit until it makes us implode"

"event","Tired. Moody. Headache.
   Woke up in such a good mood. Had such a good day yesterday.
   My friend met me after work, we went and got some veggie chili, and walked to my house afterwards cuz it was so nice out. Mind you, that's about 18 blocks. After working for 8 hours- on my feet. That guy that I'm interested in called me. Went to his place. We walked about 8 blocks to Jewel to pick up ice-cream (Godiva white-chocolate raspberry, mmm). And back. At this point my knees hurt like a bitch- but it was a beautiful night, and I felt good.
    Had a good time with this guy- we messed around for a while. I don't think I've ever had anyone pay that much attention to me, to my body... [no sex, though-he's straightedge, which is hilarious cuz i'm a Camel-lights smoking junkie]
  I haven't really like a guy in a long time. Though this isn't the sweetest thing, I'm not entirely sure what it is about him that I like so much. Maybe it's how laid back he seems. Or the fact that he's a really good person. Or that he accepts me for who i am, even though we're two completely different people. Or the fact that the reason we ever even met was that he saw me through one of the windows at my work and brought me a rose that was blue, just like the outfit I was wearing that day... 
   I don't like being strung up about a guy.
   Talked my ex today, the asshole one. Very casual conversation. I shouldn't see him, though-- all that's gonna happen is we're gonna get heroin, which I can't afford. But I can't let go....
   One of the guys I go to N.A. with stopped by my work today. Tried to get me to go tonight's meeting with him. I should've gone. But I thought I was gonna be going to this club Neo tonight (goth/industrial club that does damn good 80s music on Thursdays), so I wouldn't have had time. Now I'm just on my computer. Meeting up with my friend at 11. So I totally would've had time to go with him... 
 Shit happens.
 Just want drugs. Valium, heroin, coke, whatever. But I can't, I won't. So fuck everyone that just tries to bring me down.
 Colder in my house than it is outside."

"event","Bleached and dyed my friend's hair today- it looks so good. And I did a damn good job. He's like a brother to me. We got into a discussion today, and McDonald's nonetheless, about some decisions I've been making in my life that don't seem like the best idea... he promised he would never abandon me, just that he won't talked to me if I start doing heroin again all the time...
   Ah, relapsing Friday-- originally going to get some ecstacy, which I haven't done in 4 years. Then coke. Then we ended up getting really good dope... all you needed was a bump and you were in fuckin heaven... don't need to, can't even, shoot the shit cuz it's too pure... it was all fun until I decided to do some coke when I was headed home (at close to 4 a.m.) (had to be at work at 11 the next day)-- started puking really bad, at the train station... apparently called a friend of mine and told her that I didn't think I was gonna make it home cuz I was convinced I was gonna die... all I remember from the (10 minute) train ride home is puking into a plastic bag I conveniently grabbed from my friend's place.
  It was an interesting experience. It was my first time hanging out with this girl and her boyfriend. Real cool people; he's a really talented musician. She's kinda crazy, but nothing I'm not used to. Really cute, too-- she asked me to have a threesome with her and her boyfriend, which I will gladly participate in...
  Went to a show (Blockhead, Kid Koala, Amon Tobin) Sunday night. I was all dressed up and it was fucking freezing out... went with my best friend (he's like a brother to me; he's the one whose hair I bleached)...the guy that I like works at the place, saw him on my way in... so we're at the show, and I see my friend turn around, and start talking to someone. So I turn around- and it's my ex. The one I vowed to stab next time I saw him. I turn back around to face the stage (we were all the way up front, center, by the stage). Start shaking. He taps me on my shoulder, and when I turn around, holds his arms out for a hug. I raised my hand, about to jack him in his face- and- end up giving him a hug. Goddamn stupid emotions fuck up all fun.
  So at first I'm being a complete bitch. Then we start talking. Then he's got his arm around me. Then we're dancing. Then he's kissing my neck. Then my friend leaves, saying he's tired. Background info: they used to be best friends, that's how I met my ex. We all stopped talking for a while when we all decided to stop doing heroin back in the beginning of January. (We've all relapsed, though not together.) So I end up leaving the show early with my ex. Went back to his house. Took a bath (our old tradition- bubble baths by candlelight, usually really fucked up, so much fun..). Messed around. He apologized for being a FUCKING ASSHOLE. Promised it wouldn't happen again. (Told him I'd beat the fuck out of im if it did). But it will. He's such a little boy, a 4 yr.old trapped in a 24 yr. old's body. He's a fuckin junkie, and nothing will change that. He's going nowhere; except more down... he's been really good about NOT getting dope. But we're gonna get some tomorrow... our ""relationship"" before was basically heroin and fucking. Don't want a relationship this time around. Not sure WHAT I want. I'm just being stupid. Supposed to see him tonight. We'll see.
  That guy I like was supposed to call me when he got off work. And didn't. Can't tell if he likes me or not. All I know is, I haven't been this strung out about a guy in a while... I don't know.
  Bought a beautiful dress today. Black, low cut in the front and the back. Really soft. Asymmetrical. I love it. Now I just need a place to where it. 
   I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
   ""Steady on the grind, Steady on the grind..."" Erykah Badu with Dead Prez. Great song...
   ""I'm crying everyone's tears/I have already paid for all my future sins/There's nothing anyone can say/To take this away/It's just another day/ And nothing's any good.."" Sade. Beautiful voice, such good lyrics. 
   I've written far too much. 
   Acquired a cute new bondage bracelet. And bright red lipstick. 
   Need to get started on my tattoos. It's off to Indiana I go! Cheap ass prices, nearby, and I know a really good tattoo artist up there.
   Thinking about becoming an interior decorator. But not for typical houses, too fuckin boring. My friend and I are doing up his place, it's coming along nicely. 
   I'm gonna stop now.
   Should clean my room. 
   Ha."

    So Thursday and Friday I got to see an ex-boyfriend who I still consider a very good friend even though I NEVER GET TO SEE HIM... He's still one of the most interesting people I know, even though his views on himself are highly inaccurate... it just brought back a lot of memories, most good. It was refreshing. I'd be so much happier if he lived here instead of Bumblefuck, Mass.  Partly for selfish reasons- I know I'd do a lot less stupid things were he around. I think a lot of my problems stem for the majority of people I surround myself with...
   Got in a huge fight with my boss yesterday, left work an hour after I got there cuz I kept throwing up. I could function in between bathroom trips, but I threw up 3 times in the first hour so I guess I wasn't really a useful employee...
   So I relapsed Friday night. On heroin. That wasn't the plan at the start of the night, but in the end it was the easiest thing to get. Dope that was about 90% pure was the easiest to get. Even went down to the projects, and I got out of the car and walked around, and there was nothing there...

   terrible mood swings from laughing to screaming at people to crying nd all over again
   tried to get some dope again but my dealer turned his phone off well fuck him it's just a loss of money on his part
   nobody i want to communicate with is picking up their phone
   feet up- senses lost- waves of discommunication and nonconfrontation- streetlights glare and pose threats to my night vision- i was gone long before you had a chance to turn your head- switch on switch off-

  Speaking of drugs, I have a meeting with a drug dealer tonight. Just to talk business, not for purchasing. Gonna get some coke next week, which I haven't done in forever. Splitting it with a girl I work with...
  So windy outside. And I wore a skirt to work today...
  I'm off tomorrow, thank god. Plan to stay out all night, just to make up for how shitty last night ended up being... sat in the tattoo parlour for 4 hours, waiting for my friend to get her tattoo. And I didn't even end up getting any piercings. 
  Apparently the owner's son at my work thinks I have ""really bad emotional problems,"" as he told one of the girls I work with. I guess he's right.
   Started my day off listening to Tool, so of course I was really aggressive at work. It was interesting-- how much shit my friends let me get away with. They're so used to my random mood swings, and violent temper, that I when I start insulting them they don't even take it personally. I don't do it just because I can- but it is comforting that I know in the back of my mind that they won't hold grudges because of it. I don't know.
    Gonna go out for coffee with a friend of mine, at one of my favorite cafes. Must eat first though, because their food is way too expensive... ($8 eggs my ass)
   This cab driver I had last night had his daughter with him. It must've been so exciting for her, to be out with her dad on a saturday night to see what knid of freaks he might pick up... she was nice, though- she turned on the light so I'd have more light while I was doing my makeup. I've mastered the art of doing my makeup in moving vehicles, seeing as I always do my makeup on my way to work on the bus...
   Don't want to go back outside!!"

"event","So I got ""politely asked"" to leave my own work today after I managed to snap at everyone including the owner's son... Can't help it if I have terrible mood swings...
   I finally really like someone. He's one of the sweetest guys... we kissed for the first time yesterday- then did so for over an hour. It was just about feeling. It wasn't just to get to sex (which did not happen), it wasn't just to get some- it was completely out of shared feelings...and it was fucking amazing. The last couple guy I messed around with and the last guy I dated were just completely about fucking. I do thoroughly enjoy sex- but you gotta remember how important everything else is.. I just couldn't stop smiling... I hope this actually goes somewhere...
   Supposed to go out for eggrolls and piecrings tonight; that's the general game plan. A movie may be thrown in, still not sure about that. It's a bit anti-climatic compared to everything else.
   I'm sorry, but I'm sick of St. Patrick's Day already. People just use it as an exuse to get obnoxiously drunk and make asses of themselves while wearing all sorts of tacky clover stickers... He wasn't even born in Ireland--- he was Welsh, then kidnapped and taken to Ireland when he was 17. So HA. I don't know. People don't know shit about the holidays that they exploit the hell out of. It's a prime example of the ignorance that runs rampant.... 
   So many good shows coming up!!
   I just hope the rest of this night turns out better, though there's no way it can top last night...
   Still deciding what to get pierced tonight. There's 5 piercings I want, so it'll depend on what kind of healing time I'm willing to deal with..

  So many good shows coming up. I think, starting Monday, I'll be hitting up a concert a week, which I haven't done in a while. I miss it... A friend of mine is a security guard at one concert venue- I don't think I could that considering that there is just as much bad music out there as there is good. 
  Brain still blurry.
  I really want an ice-cream sundae right now... Or even just ice-cream.. mint chocolate chip...

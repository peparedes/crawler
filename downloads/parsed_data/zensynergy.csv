"event","Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.  If you compare yourself with others, you may become bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievments and your plans.  Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possesion in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself.  Especially do not feign affection.  Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perenial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nuture strenght of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  But do not distress yourself with imagings.  Many fears are borne of fatigue and loneliness.  eyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.  And whether or not it is clear to you; no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with god, whatever you conceive him to be, and whatever your aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.  With all its sham and drudgery and broken dreamsit is still a beautiful world.  Be careful. Strive to be happy.

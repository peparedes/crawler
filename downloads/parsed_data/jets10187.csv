"event","Its 43 minutes past midnight,
And somehow everything seems so right,
I sit here eager for what my future holds,
What will be my future mold?
I am here alone, but never lonely,
Still wondering who will be my only,
Looking back on past entries,
Waiting for that girl to be my sweet pea,
My faith still holds strong,
I never would have guessed this long,
They ask is it more important to endure,
Or to fail, and be insecure?
For me, its a double-edged sword,
Much like that of a false word,
Enduring teaches you to continue on,
While failing forces one to re-group and pick up the pieces,
One must fail before they can succeed,
So they are not filled with greed,
It is imperative to have the need,
The desire,
The stength,
To be all that one can be,
In order for one to see,
How amazing He can truly be."

"event","So it's funny how a couple days with someone can make you think about them constantly and want to continue to be around them or with them.  I met this girl on the cruise Lauren, and we hung out, kissed one night, and just spend some time together.  And ever since it's kinda seemed like I'd think about her a bunch and all kinds of stuff.  The funny thing is is that she is NOT the typical girl I'd ever want to be with in the first place, I just felt a connection.  She just turned 21 so she goes out for drinks just to drink all the time, which is understandable, but not the kind of girl I'd want in the first place.  She also smokes, any girl that smokes doesn't have a chance on this earth of me ever being with them truth be told, and I guess since I was never with her when she smoked, I somehow voided the fact that she smoked.  I also don't know her that well at all, I just know what I want to know of her.  I guess the person she seemed to be was really attractive to me, but once again, not who I'm made to be with.  So lately she just hasn't returned the few messages I've left her whatsoever, and it just kinda bothers me.  I'm just writing this so I can get my feelings out, and read along to realize its not a big deal at all, and that the facinatoin/attraction that I have has been taken too far by me.  After all, she does live in Pennsylvania.  I guess I'm just hopin to get over this feeling b/c its really doin me no good, when theres tons of beautiful girls inside and out that I would love to talk to and spend time with.  So thats that, and thats as real as it gets..."

"event","*BREAKING NEWS*

Life is great. It really it. It may be all cloudy and raniny and cold, but I'm happy as ever.  So I'm going to prom w/ Angela.  We're just friends and I really have no feelings for her in that sorta way, but I couldn't be more content.  Last year I had a great time, but I think the feelings I had may have made it tougher to just relax and completely have fun.  So I'm not sure, but I think we're goin to go in a group and that'll be pretty awesome.  I dunno bout a stretch limo, but that'd be cool too.  I also know one thing, I'm gonna be dancin till i get kicked outa that place, and I just have this great feeling that it's gonna be the best way to the chapter on my last 13 years of life of school.  But as they say, when one door closes, another door opens.  And then there's college.  If you know me at all, you probably know that I'm going to be attending Morehead State University in Kentucky.  And if you don't know because I didn't tell you its just because I'm not big on running around and telling people of my accomplishments.  Having said that, I am thrilled that I have the opportunity to be blessed enough to have the ability and people around me to help me succeed thus far in life.  Anyone that I have ever gotten close to deserves the credit for where I'm at today, especially the big man himself, God.  I feel distant sometimes to my spiritual emotions and my connection with my faith.  I think that with as busy as I am this last year of High School I have a hard time trying to stay close.  Although that is no excuse, I have recently been attending bible study regularly and get such a great feeling and closeness with my faith and my experience in getting closer to God.  I guess I feel you can never be too faithful and there's always an opportunity to become closer in your relationship with God.  I have also been able to realize more and more that so many people that I have had relationships with have really taught me so much about myself and about life.  I am so thankful for all the people that are/have been/ or will be in my life.  I know that I don't always get along with everyone and I'm sure I can make someone madder than the dickens.haha (sorry I think that sounds funny) But in saying that, I also strive to become a better person to try to understand not only myself, but understand others and listen more than I talk.  I just wanted to write because I'm kinda at a high today and I'm doin great and life is good.  I'm sorry if you or someone else isn't having a great day, but if you know me, you better believe that I really do care for who you are, regardless of what you may feel.  So have a great night and just put a smile on that face.  if you need anything you know we can talk....yup yup."

"event","This football season definately isnt anything i've ever wanted, or worked so hard for, or what i planned it to be like. I feel like ive done all i can to help and lead this team. Obviously one person doesnt make a team and i guess you could say thats part of the problem. But ive prayed and God has just given me a huge feeling of security and as i told my mom last night, so much more comes from losing than you'll ever get from winning. when you have hard times, when things dont go your way, and when the things that make you happy dont happy just the way you want, its builds you up, or should i say eventually forces you to build yourself up. you can either feel sorry for yourself and just let things be, or you can go out and fix it and do whatever necessary to do whats right and make things right. so theres my lil talk bout that.

On the contrast, this Senior year has been absolutely amazing, and so far, i couldnt plan it any better. I mean, everyone says Sr. year is the best, but noone will truly know what they're missing out on until they've experienced it, noone. Ive done more this year than i did my first 3 years combined it feels like. ive been to pep rally's, ive been to the bonfires, cook-outs, powder puff football teams, worked, gone to my brothers band competitions, gone to see my other brother in college, been to college ftball games, and have grown even closer to those around me that i care about. Not to forget, all while having Gods help and asking him to help guide me all the way through, and i just truly feel blessed. everybody goes through so many ups and downs that you cant bank on ""today being my good day."" some days are great, some days suck, and sometimes your life just kinda goes on cruise control. i would say a lot of times i feel like im just going, not doing anything special, just kinda going through the motions. I know thats that always the best thing to be doing, but its my way of getting away from the 'outside world' and just enjoying some me time. 

and its early int he morning, i really couldnt tell you why i woke up @ 6:30 the morning after a ftball game, and i kinda just lost my point. haha..but yea. love life, live it, learn from it, and know who you are."

"event","So its wed. night and I actually have some good awake time to myself. I got home from ""watching film"" w/ a buncha guys from the football team and that was all good n fun. Then I somehow walked into a black house and my parents are already sound asleep.  I've been so busy, and well, I stay busy. I guess after doing this football stuff, or HS ftball stuff should I say for 3 years now, I get used to being busy-all the time. Mon.-Fri my life goes like this:school,football,dinner, sleep and then all over again. My personal life right now is pretty pathetic but somehow I'm managing to be very content. I also didnt mention the other football,soccer, and volleyball games I go to watch and support friends of mine throughout the week. Saturday's are usually filled w/ something band related. My eldest brother is not the Westmoreland High School Band Director. I find that very odd being the youngest brother and all, but I am so proud of him. It's truly a blessing. Luckily(not) on Sundays I actually sleep in some, and then go to work @ 11:30 or so and work until about 5ish and come home and just be the best bum i know how.  Get a blanket, get on some comfortable clothes, and watch some football. I usually fall asleep on the spot and then for the night and boom, my week starts all over again. To be honest, I'm in the least complaining right now, let's just say it feels great to come home and take a seat in a dark room all alone with noone to bother you or ask anything of you, and just enjoy some me time.
     Anywho, I was thinking about my feelings and relationships I have with people and my ""pathetic"" personal life, but in reality, it's not so bad. I've lost friends, and kept few. But it never seizes to amaze me that the ones I keep are so genuine and are right by my side. Some friends that are no longer ""friends"" but acquaintances are around, and I might say hey to em every now and then, but after High School, they won't care much about me, and I guess I myself won't see them much anymore. It's actually really sad for me to think abt graduating, and people talking about...where do you want to go? what are you going to do? how come this and how come that. I'm sure you get the jist of it. And I have a general idea and that includes: studying sports medicine, vet school, and maybe some kinda marketing degree; I want to get away from all the ""normal"" things I know, which would mark out a belmont,lipscomb, or vol state(which are all great schools) and lastly I would like to get out and play football. I have a love for it like others do singing, or acting, or being an artist. It's just in my blood, and it's something I love with all my heart. I want to meet new people. People that I will carry in my heart for the rest of my life. I would also like a girl who likes me for me. A girl that makes me work to be the best I can be, but loves me for who I am, and what I stand for, a girl who isnt pretty to everyone else, but is beautiful in my eyes, a girl who loves life and is full of fun, spontaneous, and giving spirits. I'm not so much worried about having that right away, because I know I'll get my chance.
    Speaking of that, I went to the Coldplay concert w/ Natalie. It was amazing! Yeh, I used to have a crush on her in like, middle school, but she is just a lot of fun. I really enjoy her company and I think she really enjoys mine. The night couldnt have been better.  She got out of dance about 6:30 and called me up and says, ""so what about the coldplay concert?"" by 7:51 we were there, with NO TICKETS in out hands. So we walk around and I suppose the scalpers were kicked out and I was just praying that we might find someone who was selling them, and we could find noone. It was really quite discouraging. So eventually we left to go down the road to find some possible tickets, and somehow came up empty, and decided to go back. So after we parked, we probably walked around for about a good hour and I had this bright idea to just stand by the ticket booth, even though they refused to sell all the lame peoples tickets who didnt come. The first song played and we weren't in there yet, I was just ticked and had butterflies and just didnt know what to do, i felt so unlucky. Well it was like an angel came down from heaven as this woman walks up w/ her daughter and goes, ""does anyone need tickets?"" and at that moment im yelling ""ME ME ME ME."" The woman just smiled and handed me the tickets. FREE TICKETS. I offered money to her several times and each time she refused. So Natalie and I take our grass seat tickets and just gallop in there on top of the hill like we were little 2nd graders holding hands and we caught a lightning bug. It was great. Somehow thought, I saw one of my friends, and he had $60 pit tickets and was laying in the grass w/ his g/f. He GAVE US his tickets, and there goes natalie and I again running down 50 yards away. And from there on, it was just amazing. The concert ended, as I took her home while she slept in the car as peaceful as could be, and I dropped her off. It doesn't take a kiss, or something intimate to make something so special, and so amazing. What was great was to see the look in her eyes and be able to spend the time w/ her. Now if anything ever becomes of this, I have no idea, but I do know its one thing I will NEVER forget.
     Speaking of all this, I'll very plainly put that nothing in my life could be done w/o God and Jesus and everything I've been given. I realize and am thankful at how blessed I am to have someone watch over me and guide me in my journey to heaven. 

God Bless"

"event","so its sunday night, and ive done absolutely nothing today. it feels so good just to sit here and do nothing. there were many times i wanted to get out and do something, but i just laid down, cuddle under my covers and fell asleep. it just feels so good, i cant describe it.  i worked mon.-thurs from abt 9:45 til 5 each day except one day i had to work all day, which was hell, but i thrive on interacting w/ people, so its alright.  i cant say that money is a bad thing.  i also worked out w/ dd again this week 2x a day before and  after work.  i really enjoy being around him.  dd is a black athletic kid i play ftball w/ who actually has a great head on his shoulders.  hes an awesome soccer player, good personality, the girls love him, quite popular, but somehow hes got it in his head to do what right, and i just really appreciate him.  hes like the only friend ive got on that ftball team that i can relate w/ and talk to. b/c we're both not like, total jocks and we have personalities, but we try to do whats right and stay true to ourselves. we share so many of the same views.  but anyways, we worked out a bunch just so we could not lose the working out we've already done, and help gain a notch on all of those athletic freaks who do nothing but drink and party but are still so much better than us. so anyways, yesterday was a pretty calm day also. my dad and i mowed the hawkins practice field and watered it, and then mowed another yard and finally came home.  then around 2 i did, well i dunno, i went and saw linds olsen @ work n drove around for a litle while. then i went and took some pics and talked to a guy @ my work who takes professional pics and he showed me some stuff abt it that was cool. so anyways, my senior year is approaching so fast, and i want it to be here, but i dont want it to end, i know it will be over so fast and i just dont know.  i guess i can just enjoy it day by day. i want to play ftball in college, ive definately made my mind up on that.  and i also want to maintain over a 4.0 avg. just b/c it looks good and it will give me a sense of self accomplishment.  i really want to be a college coach someday, and maybe that entails being a teacher first and coaching like high school, but i know i want to go a lot bigger. ive got a love for athletics and i cant get enough of it.  but i also enjoy a lot of other things such as photography, maybe being a vet, or maybe owning a lawncare business - which makes great money and my dad did that full time until he had thousands of dollars worth of mowing equip. stolen, and he just decided to stop. ive always wanted to give that bak to him, i hate it for him, and hes the last guy that deserved that to happen do him. anyways, im going to watch a movie and have some ""me"" time before this week of work and ftball hits be in the face. oh yea, storms coming yayyy, i love storms..call me if ur scared..or just come see me @ work. gnite..tootles"

"event","yesterday i read some poems of mine, and well, i just enjoy writing and sorta expressing myself through words..so im going to try and write some more..some on here, and some just to myself, you are allowed to judge and interpret them however you like, either way it wont bother me...

#1

driving along on that dark road,
i saw so many beautiful sites,
the stars were shining brighter than before,
my smile was wide and true,
as pure as the feeling inside me,
i looked next to me, 
and there was you,
saying nothing, but smiling still,
as we drove down that dark road to nowhere,
happiness was of the essence,
and that's what i felt,
i kept driving and just thinking,
thinking of life, thinking of you,
and everything seemed the same,
i was still smiling,
the stars were still guiding me along my path,
i was driving right along that dark road,
smiling wide and true,
except this time it was without you.


#2

untrue,
what is or isnt,
what you see on the outide may be nothing of whats on the inside,
what i say may not be what i mean,
the things i do may not be what i represent,
my morals may seem faded,
what you think about me may have changed,
do you know me, 
or do you want to know me,
are you willing to take a chance on the outside of me,
to figure out who i am on the inside,
the big guy you see is so weak sometimes,
the strength i present is nothing,
nothing of what i am,
what i say isn't meant to make you happy,
but to let you know how i feel,
untrue will never be the case again,
the only one who ever knows me again,
will only know one word,
truth.

"event","I got a new camera...yayyy. Well I bought it myself, still, im muy happy to say the least. I originally thought I was going to purchase a 35mm or SLR, but I decided to go digital b/c I can make several prints off of my own computer, and I can mess w/ em and adjust them to my liking.  If I were to have gotten a film camera, I'd have to buy the film, hope and pray that they all came out how I would have liked them to, then scan them, and then have them on my computer just to make more copies or adjust them.  The camera is a Canon S1 IS and retails anywhere from $267 to abt $400 and I got it for $200 with shipping.  It's only 3.2 megapixels which is ""dots per square inch"" which I understand is not nearly has high as some of the really nice camera's, but it has a 10x zoom.  So basically, if someone had a 5.0 megapixel camera and took it from a distance, and then put it on ther camera and zoomed it, it wouldnt be nearly as clear. With my camera, I can zoom in from a pretty good distance and still get the full affect of the picture.  It also has a movie mode which I don't know what the heck I'm going to do w/ it, but it should be a lot of fun. So if anyone wants to go picture-taking with me and just enjoy unique different abnormal but beautiful pictures, call me or leave a response b/c I'd love to go.  I won't get the camera until abt Friday I beleive, but still, I can't wait.  Like I said, you can leave a message on here or call me if you'd like to go do this w/ me."

today ive already gone and filled up the tank in the burban in rivergate, came home and went and mowed someones yard, came home and mowed my own yard, cleaned up my house(parents are coming home from cruise today) and now its not even noon and i just dont have anything to do. but life is great indeed. i mean yea theres soem stuff i might like to add, but for right now, life is good. it would be nice to have a girlfriend to just hang out w/ and enjoy each others company, but as ive always said, ""all in good time.""  well ima go ride around town b/c i can, and maybe pick up a bite to eat. so you've got my number if your interested in hangin out."

it was quite the weekend for me. i took the act's sat. morning @ vol state and all i have to say is that that test is hell, esp. when its abt 20 degrees in there.  after i went home i went straight to a tsu ftball camp and to say the least they were interested in me. first off, im white and well, im good. so anyway, yea it was a great ego stroke to have the guy keep coming over and talking to me and blah blah blah, but if i get that much attention at a school such as tsu, then id like to explore myself elsewhere where i know im getting a good education @ what i WANT to do, and also that im comfortable w/ my surroundings - when 6% of white people go there, i dont consider that comfortable.  so anyways, my friend ed is pretty much a superstar and will be playing at a big college and i called him up b/c the tsu wanted me to tell him hello and he said he was going to an Alabama camp, and that i could come if i wanted. well it just so happend that 2 hrs after i left the tsu camp i was headed on my 4 hr trip to bama.  you cant even begin to compare bama and tsu, its like polar opposites, its just amazing. bama was so massive, nice, and just overwhelming that you'd just have to be there to see it.  to say the least, it was ed getting all the attention as i just when abt my business mixed in the ""crowd.""  i mean when you're 3 or 4 inches shorter, and 30-40 lighter, you just dont look like the rest of the guys and thats the reason bama has such a good football team.  the only high note was me doing 225 lbs on bench 15x and u wouldnt appreciate that whatsoever unless u prolly play the sport.  its like you tellin me you can sing so high or so low, and id say so what, well your prolly thinkin the same abt wut i just said. anyways the camp went alright, its always good to measure up the competition and see where you stand. i think its ironic how you think abt how good you are at anything, or could be at anything, and really, you have NO idea whats out there, and how much harder they're working than you. and the only thing i can control abt myself is doing that much more that everyone else to prepare myself, and asking God to help my through the journey and be along side of me, b/c i WILL get a scholarship to play ball in college. so after the camp we trucked home and i was just drained and still am, so here i sit just thinking about so much more than im writing right here and well quite frankly i dont wanna right it b/c i dont feel like getting into it w/ anyone. i just want some peace and quiet."

Today was another day, well yea just another day.  The 2 biggest upsides were probably no football and hangin out w/ Kristin. Kristin is cool, fun, different, but a good different, and just yea, I enjoy hanging out w/ her. I cleaned up the house by myself this morning, and then went to the mall to pick up Kristin and then we came back over n hung out @ my house for a little while. At first we...well we tried watchin tv, but that was boring and stupid, so I found a photo album and we decided to look through it, everything was goin great till I flipped the page and there was a pic of my brothers and I naked at a young age, she just looked @ me and smiled and I quickly flipped the page. There was only one other minor page that we flipped to and there was more or numerous pictures of my moms 30th b-day party and oh buddy, watch out. So then we came and got on the computer and found all these people in chat rooms lookin for ""hot,sexy,horny"" people and we decided to go to yahoo images and find and old wrinkly woman and when someone would ask for a pic, we'd send em that, it was quite the adventure, so after that I took her back and dropped her off and then went to work. Work was decent, the best part of that was having Natalie come visit me, I love having people come see me, its like a buncha lil xmas presents, and I just truly appreciate my good friends. Anyway, she came and stayed for about an hour as she would dance like a fool when noone was watching and keep trying to have me help her decide btw an ice cream or nachos - she ended up gettin both and eatin em. Not to mention she got discounted prices.  So anyway, we made a deal and tmorrow @ work, shes bringin me some cake, yummmm..then the rest was just work, work, oh and work. Except for when I was holding this girls car keys for her while she played putt putt and i went out and moved her car to the otherside of the parking lot, that was great fun. Im likein this spontinaety(sp?) stuff, as long as its all in good fun. So anyways Im here now, and jussst abt to go and enjoy my nice biggg bed(i gotta new one) so all i have to say is gnite and take care ;)"

"event","to say the least, this was one of what needs to be many enjoyable summer nights

Natalie Sims is a girl who I used to have a crush on in middle school, you know those cute little crushes you have and you have them for no particular reason..well one of them. Anyways, I was on the verge of eating dinner, as I recieved a call from her, asking me to go hang out, no matter what it might be, she just wanted some company, and I'm always ready to go be myself around someone who is fun to be around.  Well we figured out that we were going to go to Opry Mills, just because well, we both wanted to get outa h'ville for a lil bit. So I'm pretty sure on our way there there's all this verry confusing construction and I missed the exit, well...sorta. I passed the exit (abt 20 yds.) slowed down and went inbtw the cones, reversed, and did a Uey through some more cones, and on our way we went, I'm not sure how fond of that decision Natalie was, but I was pleased w/ it.  I mean, I wasn't abt to go to nashville. Anyway, yea it's fun to be spontaneous every once inna while. So we went around Opry Mills and had our fun times laughin and what not, but I have to say the best store was the Dry Ice store, it may be girlie, but it was awesome, all this neat little stuff, I couldn't get enough of it.  So we walked, well I jogged b/c she's the fastest walker in the world, but anyway going from store to store looking at nice clothes that were priced to high, among other that were down right slutty. Then we found a lil glazed pecan, almond, peanut stand, and her eyes lit up and said ""D, we gotta got some of them!"" So I gave it, but not until i talked the guy into letting us have a size up for just the price of a snack size, money's tight, and well it's all good.  So hmm, we got some root beer and on our way out decided that we must go to Rain Forest Cafe together sometime. I think I can handle that. Anyways we rode back to hendersonville listening to all kinds of music n singing w/ our horrible voice, well she's pretty good, me.just no. Anyway, its great to be w/ someone who doesnt care abt who they are and what  they do around you, basically being themselves. Also, on our ride home we made fun of all the people getting pulled over by the ""po po"" and it was good fun. So we get to hendersonville, and drive back into town, and Natalie has this idea...""let's go 'scary road huntin'."" I quickly gave her a strange look and well I said what the heck, I mean I don't get the chance that often to be spontaneous and just have good company.  So we went down the new Indian Lake extension, over the bridge and went stright - straight to nowhere. Well that was the best part, except I didn't have a camera.  Well anyways, have way through our excursion, we found our way to Station Camp HS.  Buttt, we decided that wasn't good enough, so we turned back down Station Camp Creek Rd. and went straight. Took a couple lefts, a couple rights, annnnd then we found a highway, but certainly not one we were familiar w/ so we went straight some more. And low and behold we're in the middle of Gallatin. Think abt it, from the Shoney's in H'ville, to the Krystal in Gallatin is a good ways, annnd we took backroads, probably one the best nights I've had in a good long time, w/ someone who genuinly can be themselves along w/ my friend.  It sure was a much needed summer night."

"event","I liked the good ole days,
Days when everything wasn't so analysed,
I liked being stuck behind that abandoned house,
Late at night while I held you tight,
I often wonder what it would be like,
What would it be like if those little kisses meant something to you,
What would it be like if you still wanted me to hold you as we fell asleep watching a movie,
What would it be like if our drives in the middle of the night no nowhere never ended,
What would have happend if ""He"" never broke your heart in two,
Ante then I realized that I'm 17,
And your just 16, still yound and amazing,
What's the hurry?
Why do I even care so much?
Well what it really comes down to is how much I care about you as a person,
If we're ever together then so be it,
If not, then God has blessed me by putting you in my life and it's not meant to be,
I realize we have our differences,
Doesn't everyone,
I think I'm just trying to let you know how much I care about you for who you are, 
And I want to always be one of the best friends you've truly ever had,
I'm tired of our little ""arguments"",
I was thinking about how it was and should be,
Just you and me,
Enjoying each others company, 
no more, no less,
And just let us be 17 and 16 and love and live life to the fullest,
As each of us deserves,
And I too, would like to always remember you as one of the best friends I've ever had."

"event","i know...i coulda made all these the same entry's, but oh well.  I just am a little discontent @ the moment.  It's been a long day, a REALLY long day. $1,200, 13 hrs, hundreds of people, and one worker later, i sit here, just not content.  But still, I dont rely for me to fix my troubles or problems.  Cuz there sure as hell wasnt 2 sets of footprints in the sand, there was one, and it was me being carried.  so on that note, i shall stay being carried to whatever woman eases and comforts me heart, whatever lifestyle brings a smile to my face, and carried in the right direction, by not just God, but Jesus and the Holy Spirit as they are all one in the same.  It bothers me that some people take things into their own hands when they need to let God take care of it.  When people lie their way through things, just so they can get what they want, when people do things to ease their needs, and not so much everyone else whom they affect.  But its your decisions, lie all u want, be who you're not, and go on with life, b/c you cant just bypass what you've done and the decisions you've made or are about to make, its there, and above all, God knows that instead of letting him carry you, you've made attempts to jump out of his arms and do it on your own, until he comes back again seeing that you weren't able  to do it w/o him, and he graciously picks you back up, over and over. Think about what you do before you do it, think about who you're lieing to to make you happy, and think about why God CAN fix your needs and problems, and truly make you happy.

"event","A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the door-step
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So... bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singing...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And 'em good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a Rollin' Stone
But that's not how it used to be
When The Jester sang for The King and Queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
In a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while The King was looking down
The Jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practised in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
The Byrds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With The Jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While Sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation Lost in Space
With no time left to start again
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candle stick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
They all caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die"

p.s. a girl and some true friends would help also b/c i forgot to say that i dont drink n do drugs...nor do i plan on it..so yea...God Bless.."

"event","God does not ask that you prove your worth or how correct you may be, He just wants you to be at peace knowing you are right, rathering than having to be right.  I glorify God through everything I do in life, including sports, school, family, friends, and those whom I don't even know.  God has blessed me w/ an intelligent mind, and He would be glad to know that one way I choose to glorify him is through the grades I make in school.  It's not that either one of us is right, all that matters is that we both have faith and believe in the same God.  I choose not to argue w/ those who have no time to listen to anyone else's point of view accept for their own.  That's obviously why we have ears and mouths - theres appropriate times to listen and an appropriate time to talk, you cant have one without the other, therefor, I choose to let you have your way b/c its not worth the emotions or time when I know your not listening and don't even care about what I have to say.  Somehow I still managed to hear your point, and yes, I agree that if there was a man on the street corner holding up a sign glorifying God w/ a Bible verse, he would be better off than a man making 200K who could give a rats ass about God, and just goes about life not glorifying God.  My only point (which I never had the chance to state) was that the man on the street corner is no more glorifying God holding up a sign on a street corner than a man who is thankful for the talents God has given him to make 200K a year, and glorifies and credits God for his wealthiness.  And not wealthy as in money, but wealthy as in sprit, mind, and body.  I may not be rich, but I'm thankful to have you in my life and therefor I feel rich."

"event","Sorry for the longer than anticipated absence...have been busy with schoolwork and exams.  Very ready for this semester to be over in some ways...but not looking forward to next semester LOL. 

I'm getting in that holiday mood again, which is nice.  I am finally finding a compromise with the fall weather that I usually hate (for the cold and the general lack of sunlight).  I've also found my new means of relaxation...reading in the living room with my newly crafter 'study' playlist going softly in the background.  It's full of bands/singers like Bob Dylan, The Dodos, Uh Huh Her, Tegan and Sara, Dave Matthews Band and Augie March (seriously awesome Aussie band...you should check them out!!). This playlist is so relaxing I've fallen asleep to it.  I am in love with it.

I have also started getting my sleep schedule back on track...not including the past few nights haha.  I was going to bed as early as 10 - 11 p.m. for a few weeks there...now it's at a comfortable time anywhere between 12:30 - 2 a.m. which is nice.  I end up not sleeping my day away, and wake up feeling more rested.  So, one goal down, more to go!

Been having fun in Oxford with awesome people up there...fun times going to drag shows, and I might be even performing a drag number in the coming months! Exciting!

Sorry this is a shorter update, but nothing of much excitement going on at the moment."

"event","&nbsp;Still alive...which may be disappointing to some I realize. &nbsp;My level of boredom this evening has vanquished every other emotion so here I am.<br /><br />Summer was alright...wished it were better. &nbsp;I realize I say that after most summers, which is a red flag I suppose that I should do more during those four months. &nbsp;It just never seems to work out. &nbsp;Vacation was fun, though we missed having Brenda, John and Haley along this time. Always good to get hit on by the resort maintenance guy who essentially asks if you're going to be alone in your hotel room later that night....ugh. Hopefully next year's Cayman trip will be the best yet. &nbsp;<br /><br />School is back in session...I only have two classes this semester, which is a nice break. &nbsp;Still doesn't help my nerves and the pressure over grades though, as much as I try not to obsess over them. &nbsp;It's hard not to when you know that if you don't get at least a C in a class you will have to take it over so you can graduate. &nbsp;I've been thinking more about what I actually want to do after I graduate, and I've decided to try for grad school and get my master's in either education or sociology. &nbsp;I'm considering teaching high school level sociology. &nbsp;The other option I'm considering is mastering in counseling instead and doing something with counseling for social services. &nbsp;Of course what I really want to do is have my own art studio to do freelance work and teach informal classes for anyone interested, like underprivileged kids and whatnot. &nbsp;But in order to do that I gotsta make some monies somehow, ya know?<br /><br />On that note I have no idea when the hell I'll graduate. &nbsp;I've had senioritis for years now, LOL. &nbsp;I'm in my 5th year now and I won't be graduating in the spring either...thanks to the university not offering the classes I still need for my major and the probably need to retake two classes over. &nbsp;Not to mention there's still my capstone course which is essentially your senior thesis...which I am not looking forward to AT ALL. Writing a 12 page paper is HELL for me let alone writing a 50 + page one. &nbsp;Apparently there's an alternative capstone course I can take, it just depends on whether it gets offered again soon.<br /><br />I've been trying to reorganize my life lately, and get motivated. &nbsp;It's still not working too well...I mean I have made some progress but I haven't done as much as I'd hoped to by the end of September. &nbsp;I've really only accomplished one of my goals for this month. &nbsp;It's so much harder than I could ever realize...I just cannot motivate myself to do things like go to bed at a reasonable time, eat healthy, exercise, etc. &nbsp;As much as I try, it's the most difficult thing ever.<br /><br />So enough about my failings at life...I promise I am actually excited about some things. &nbsp;And I realize that unless I just make myself do these things, I never will get anywhere in the first place, and that the longer I put them off, the worse it is or me physically and mentally. &nbsp;I'll get there eventually. &nbsp;That's what I have to tell myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other than all that, I've just been trying to stealthily avoid the swine flu. &nbsp;It has killed one person at my university so far (originally it was thought another student died from it but it was ruled out as incorrect) and about 300 + students have had it here. &nbsp;It's pretty scary, but at the same time, I realize there are literally thousands of students here so a couple hundred is not a huge number when it comes down to it.<br /><br />That's about it for now. &nbsp;Oh, and Beatles Rock Band = AMAZINGNESS. &nbsp;And Coheed &amp; Cambria = TEH SEX.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","<p><br />Wow, it's been awhile.&nbsp; <br /><br />-School is going well this semester.&nbsp; I'm enjoying my classes for the most part and have awesome professors.&nbsp; Hopefully I will survive this semester of German, because right now it is kicking my ass.<br /><br />-Went to Dragon*Con in Atlanta a few weeks ago with some online buddies.&nbsp; Had a fucking BLAST!&nbsp; We all went to see The Dark Knight at midnight one night (and we are&nbsp;officially badasses for having survived downtown Atlanta at 3 a.m. looking&nbsp;for a cab)&nbsp;and we got to see MSI perform the last night of the convention, which was amazing! Jimmy was definitely in his prime that night.&nbsp; Such hilarious bits as Jimmy giving a lightsaber a blowjob and dressing up in wings, a bra, a tiara and makeup ensued.&nbsp; Steve Righ? also did some amazing interpretive dances.&nbsp; Unfortunately I got my camera stolen at that show, so that was a major letdown, not having anything to show from my trip, including the kick ass videos I took of MSI.&nbsp; Jimmy also had to deal with several people charging the stage, and they were in costume, which was pretty funny, especially when someone dressed as Predator came up XD<br /><br />Some quote highlights, from what I can remember -</p><p>&quot;FUCK MAGIC THE GATHERING, AND FUCK FANTASY FOOTBALL!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You all wish you were badass enough to be in Slytherin!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You all wanna sleep with her, but she won't sleep with you, because you're all a bunch of neeeerrrrrddddsss!&quot;<br /><br />ILY Jimmy.<br /><br />What else...went to the Caymans in late July with a bunch of family, we had a total blast.&nbsp; Left a case full of 52 of my DVDs (including ALL my JD ones) on the plane; lost them all.&nbsp; Had to buy every one of them back, which sucked.&nbsp; But it's all better now.<br /><br />Oh, and I&nbsp;am utterly obsessed with the Twilight series now.&nbsp; I am almost done with Eclipse, and then it's on to Breaking Dawn.&nbsp; Cannot WAIT for the movie.<br /><br />That's about all, so..........fo shizzle my nizzle, and all that.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

XD<br /><br />""Why did you guys dress me up like Amy Winehouse?""<br /><br />""You guys look like a dark vampire army out there in the darkness.&nbsp; But vampires don't buy tickets!&nbsp; Vampires don't wait in line! They float above the line! *makes gestures*""<br /><br />""You're all pregnant here tonight, right?""<br /><br />(while waving our arms) ""Now just the blind people!""<br /><br />*is now in his boxers and pulls down the back slightly* ""Does this look clean to you?""<br /><br />""We are not here to contribute to your high crime rate!""<br /><br />*after singing Faggot* ""It doesn't matter if I know the words or not, as long as I hit the high note at the end, right? *sings* blah blah faggot blah blah FAGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTT!! In fact, you can use that anytime you don't know what to say to someone, just belt it out -- OOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTT!""<br /><br />(during autographs):<br /><br />*music comes on and he's dancing* ""Who knew I would like this? Well they were riiiiight!""<br /><br />*girl comes up to ask Jimmy for a kiss; he tells her no and she asks why; he holds up his hand with his wedding band* ""Read it and weep!""<br /><br />*fan offers him a piece of gum* ""Are you trying to tell me my crotch smells?"" *puts gum in his pants*<br /><br /><br />Oh, and while we were waiting outside, there was this middle aged black guy in a wheelchair with his legs amputated at the knees, and he had a cardboard sign that read ""Give me money or I'll kick you in the face"" LMFAO!!&nbsp; He kept making cracks at the crowd, it was hilarious.&nbsp; And there was a creepy homeless guy who kept making dying sounds out of nowhere and complimenting my friend on her short skirt XD<br /><br />Great night and I had a total blast!</p>"

"event","The semester is overrrrrr!!! *dances*

I'm in one of those moods where I'm really ecstatically happy but really horribly depressed at the same time.&nbsp; See, this one class of mine I need a C or better because it counts towards my major.&nbsp; Well, I got a C on the first exam, a C+ on my term paper (I'll get to that in a minute) and I don't think I'll get above that on the final I just took tonight.&nbsp; In fact I completely bullshat my essay questions.&nbsp;So I'm thinking, hey I might pull this off afterall. Then I get home and realize that all the little homework assigments and in-class quizzes I missed from not going to class count for 20% of my grade. So basically I'm probably fucked.&nbsp; Now I'll have to take this fucking class over sometime next year so now I'll have to write another damn term paper for it and be that many credit hours behind, more than I already am. Fuck.

So about the term paper. I put so much work into that thing. It was ten pages and I put as much detail and work into it as I possibly could.&nbsp; I really did the best I could on that paper.&nbsp; And I get a effing 79 on it.&nbsp; To make matters worse, his little grading scale he attached to it, basically went on about how it was too generalized and average, and that it was too repetitive and wordy and there were mechanical errors and blah blah blah.&nbsp; So I felt pretty fucking low the whole way home and feel like a writing failure at this point.&nbsp; I don't know what to do when it comes to future term papers.&nbsp; Some professors seem to really like my writing style, while others are politely telling me it sucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't please everybody!&nbsp; I mean, how much more detailed can I get? I gave him I don't know how many damn statistics and figures and sociological factors and explanations.....I just don't know what else I could've done, ya know? I think I need a drink.

Anyway, on to the good news. We got Sophie's bloodwork back Wednesday morning, and they said her levels were almost normal, and that the doctor wasn't concerned about her anymore.&nbsp; She also said that since she gained a little weight and was eating a lot, that those weren't normal characteristics of cancer, especially if her levels went up.&nbsp; So she's okay, I guess she just had a little infection.&nbsp; We got her groomed Wednesday, and when she came out they put a little bandana collar around her for Christmas. I couldn't get over how ridiculously cute she looked.&nbsp; That and she smells like the Downy ball XD

So now I can focus on Christmas and sleeping in, and that makes me happy.&nbsp; I bought stuff tonight to do my gingerbread house this weekend.&nbsp; We're supposed to get a shitload of snow this weekend, so I gotta have something to keep me busy.&nbsp; Still got a few more decorations to get up, but everything looks pretty damn cool so far.&nbsp; Then I gots almost all my shopping and wrapping left to do but that's okay.&nbsp; I love wrapping gifts and Christmas shopping for that matter.&nbsp; I hope it snows just a little on Christmas. Just an inch would be nice.&nbsp; And I hope I get to go out and play in the snow this weekend like the inner eight year old that I am XD. I'd love to be able to go sledding!!

That's all for now. Hope everyone is well."

I don't even care at this point.</p><p>I feel like I don't even know you anymore.</p><p>I feel like you've changed. Too much. So much that I've lost a lot of the respect I always held for you in such high regard. </p><p>I wish I hadn't put you on a pedestal like I did. I wish I realized sooner that you're really no different than the others.</p><p>I feel abandoned and replaced, and I know for a fact that I'm not the only one.</p><p>I feel like everything I've ever said and done for you was a waste of time. I feel used.</p><p>I feel lied to. I feel misled. I feel stupid. All because of you.</p><p>I know that if you ever knew this was about you, I'd lose you forever as a friend. That it would tear you up and rip you apart. Though it's hard to even acknowledge you as one anymore as it is.</p><p>All your promises turned out to be empty and broken. All your pledges of being there have dissolved to nothing. Especially when I needed you the most. </p><p>You're confusing, you make promises right and left but you don't keep them, and you make no sense whatsoever.</p><p>I trust you. I don't know why, but I still do. But maybe that's because in my mind, you don't even care enough anymore to share any of my information with others anyway.</p><p>I feel like I don't compare to her in your eyes. I'm not as good as her.&nbsp; I feel like no one compares to her, in fact. Now she takes precidence over all.</p><p>I think she's a manipulator.&nbsp; I think she's needy and at one point or another, it's going to blow up in your face.&nbsp; And in all honesty, I'll be the one&nbsp;thinking ""I told you so.""</p><p>I feel like I don't matter to you anymore.&nbsp; I feel like more of an acquaintance nowadays, when I used to be one of the people that mattered most to you.</p><p>I think you make too many excuses for your behavior.&nbsp; Just tell the fucking truth already. You never had&nbsp;a problem doing that before.</p><p>You tore me apart. You put me through absolute HELL.&nbsp; You put me through the worst depression of my entire life that took me nearly a year's worth of hard work to get through. And you don't even have a clue.</p><p>I built my life back up.&nbsp; To a place that's so much better than any state I was in when you were such a big part of my life.&nbsp; </p><p>I don't regret you coming into my life.&nbsp; I know it happened for a reason. It took me a long time to realize that.&nbsp; But now I know why I was meant to meet you and what you were meant to bring out of me. And despite the resentment I hold for you, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all that you've taught me and how you made one of the biggest positive changes in my life so far.&nbsp; You helped me discover my true self.</p><p>I believe you to be one of my soulmates.&nbsp; And when I say soulmate, I mean someone who was meant to come into my life to wake me up and stir me around to learn something, and then disappear. You made me look at myself. Soulmates don't always last forever.&nbsp; And they're not often actual lovers.</p><p>It's better this way. It took me this long to realize it, but it's true. I was in over my head.&nbsp; I was completely dependent on you.&nbsp; My happiness depended on your happiness.&nbsp; And that's not right.</p><p>I'll always be here for you, even though you don't need me anymore.&nbsp; You have other people for that now.</p><p>You let me down. I'm disappointed in you.&nbsp; Mostly because I thought you were different. I thought you were special. I thought you would be the one to change my opinion on your kind. But I was proven wrong once again. I'm not so naive as to think you're all bad, it's just that few of you exist.</p><p>You just don't know what you want. And once you get what you think you want, you don't know what to do with it.&nbsp; </p><p>You moved too fast. Sorry, but it's the truth.&nbsp; And in all honesty, I still think you settled for what came along.</p><p>I still hold you close, but you're slipping away more and more every day.&nbsp; And you don't seem to be doing anything to hang on.&nbsp; I'm through being the one to try and tighten my grip.</p><p>I hope you're happy and I wish you nothing but a successful, happy and healthy life.&nbsp; But it's really hard sometimes when you act the way you do.</p><p>If you do what I have an uneasy feeling that you're going to do soon, that's it. I'll be convinced you don't care anymore.</p><p>I don't hate you. I don't dislike you. I'm just upset that it had to turn out like this. I'm upset that your priorities have changed.&nbsp; I like you. I love you. You can always reach out to me, and I will listen. I will always be your friend for as long as you want to be mine. I will always try to help you and give you advice, and I will always be there to laugh and muck around with you. But should you trip and fall, remember that you dug the hole yourself. I'll always love you, you stupid head.</p><p>That's all I can think to say on the matter. Love and hugs to all. </p><p>Even you.</p>"

Had to write an eight page term paper (which ended up being ten), I've got all this pressure of the last weeks of school on me, another term paper due next week, exams, etc.&nbsp;

And&nbsp;on top of it all, I found out&nbsp;today that one of my cats may possibly have leukemia.

Sophie's bloodwork came back not so great.&nbsp; Her&nbsp;white bloods cells are low and some other levels are apparently low.&nbsp; They said it could just be&nbsp;a low grade infection (she's been having diarrhea for the past two days and she's on an antiobiotic for a week) or it could possibly be leukemia. When we took her to the vet last night they said the worst case scenario was intestinal cancer. Now they're saying it could be leukemia. So I don't know. We won't know for sure until she's done with the antibiotic and&nbsp;we take her back to get her blood count rechecked in about a week&nbsp;and&nbsp;a half.

The weird thing is she's acting perfectly normal. She's purring, eating, drinking, running around at times.&nbsp; You wouldn't know she was sick by&nbsp;being around her.

So I'm pretty upset about this.&nbsp; I mean, we've only had her&nbsp;just&nbsp;going on a year (she originally belonged to my cousin for several years) and now this happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;I view pets as family members, so if her tests come back the same, I'm gonna be&nbsp;depressed.&nbsp; Especially because&nbsp;there probably won't be a set time frame of how long she'll be around.

So, I'm asking that if you do pray or whatever, just pray for her or keep her in your thoughts. It may seem weird&nbsp;doing that for a cat, but I'm attached to her now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't grow up with her like my other cat, Butterscotch, but still.

So that's that. Going to Colorado Friday morning for the weekend, coming back Monday night.&nbsp; Don't know if I'll have internet access or not, most likely not if only occasionally since we're not staying at the hotel this time.&nbsp; Going there for the annual Christmas parade my aunt's little town has. Should be fun and a nice break, but with all this weighing on my mind, it's also gonna be stressful at the same time.

Now it's 3:08 a.m. and I have to be up at 8:15.&nbsp; So I'm heading to sleepyland (hopefully).

P.S.- Term papers can kiss the fattest part of my ass."

YAYNESSSSSSS (will post pics later)<br /><br />It's about 5 a.m., just got done writing a short paper for class, I am crashing now so I can get the three hours of sleep I can get before getting up. Oh how I wish I could skip my first class this morning. I could if I didn't have to come get this stupid fucking assignment handout. Seeing as I don't know what it entails or when it's even due, I figure I better get it today as opposed to Friday, since it could even be due then. Ugh.<br /><br />But then again, the rest of the day should be awesome! New hair todayyy! And then Halloween, which will pretty much just be me giving out a little candy at my grandma's then walking around with my mom and talking to people we know in my grandma's neighborhood. Hopefully I'll score some free candy out of it. WTF is up with people not giving candy to anyone who isn't like 12? Seriously, a few years ago some people in that neighborhood didn't want to give me or Amanda any candy cause they said we were too old. Who the fuck cares?? IT'S FREE CANDY COME ON. Not like there are that many kids going around that place anyway, not like they're gonna run out. Geez.&nbsp;Personally I don't think you should ever be tool old to trick or treat. Fuck, I'm gonna try to get candy out of anyone I can tonight XD<br /><br />Then we're going for margaritas afterwards, as usual. WOOOOO! I'm gonna need it after all this school crap. </font>"

"event","<p>This weekend was one of the most amazing weekends of my life.<br /><br />I feel like a whole new person in a lot of ways because of it.<br /><br />Long story short, on Saturday me, my cousin and his girlfriend headed to Bloomington, Indiana to see the Dalai Lama speak. It was so incredibly inspiring to hear him speak in person.&nbsp; It's amazing what kind of effect it can have on you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I'll try to summarize it fairly quickly as I'm gonna have to chow down dinner in a few, but basically it all began with a&nbsp; three hour car ride to Bloomington starting at the ungodly hour of 7 a.m. and cussing out Indiana for having shitty interstate signs that aren't labeled well.&nbsp; Bloomington is such an awesome town, so many stores and restaurants, and the IU campus is cool too.&nbsp; So we had lunch, shopped a bit then went to listen to His Holiness speak for two hours.&nbsp; Then we had dinner at Longhorn and drove back, thankfully making it in only 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; I dozed off on the way back, then we chilled at their apartment for almost two hours. Then I went out to meet Lisa at Shrom's house so we could surprise her for her 20th.&nbsp; Ended up getting home around 3 a.m. or so and crashed.<br /><br />I just feel renewed and committed to bettering myself and anything in society that I can.&nbsp; Just......wow. </p><p>I'll have more to write after Halloween (getting my hair cut and dyed that day!! Gonna be a big change) aaaaand then Saturday is our Halloween Party.&nbsp; I finally decided I'm going as Kat Von D. I get to put rub on tattoos all over my arms XD</p>"

"event","I just have to get something off my chest here real quick:

I've noticed a shitload of people on Buzznet, Blogspot, etc. bashing MSI and whining about how they can't believe MCR would support a band like that and that MSI are offensive, gross, immoral, disgusting, sexist, racist, etc. etc.

I'd just like to say that if you can't realize what MSI sing about is all in FUN and in a totally joking manner ( I mean hell, you know&nbsp;Jimmy has&nbsp;to be on some weird shit to write some of these lyrics XD) and that it's not MEANT to be taken seriously (liner notes in one of the albums proves this), then sorry, but&nbsp;you need a reality check and you need to buck the fuck up already. You say MCR stands for acceptance, tolerance, etc, well in their own unique way, so does MSI.&nbsp; They're going against the mainstream, speaking their minds, not giving&nbsp;a shit what anyone thinks, and&nbsp;going out of their ways to be un PC, and I admire that. Yes, I said that. Think of me what you want, or just go back to your bitching and complaining.

Yes, they wrote a song called Panty Shot. Yes, it talks about a five year old in sexually explicit&nbsp;tones. Is it serious?&nbsp;Of course not.&nbsp; MSI are out to shock you, out to make you think, out to not make you take everything so damn seriously. So lighten up and get over it.&nbsp; I love them, and&nbsp;even if all these shit rumors going around are true, I will continue to listen to both bands and admire the people in them. Thank you, and fuck off.&nbsp;"

"event","<p>I figured it was time for an entry, seeing as I haven't posted in nearly two weeks. Wow I'm behind on things.<br /><br />Nothing too exciting has happened.&nbsp; Yet, at least. There's some awesome stuff coming up though. Like on Oct. 27 I'm going to see the Dalai Lama speak in Indiana. Ethan's going up a few days ahead of time and I'm gonna&nbsp;do the 3 hour drive up with his girlfriend that day.&nbsp; I'm supposed to go to a surprise party that night&nbsp;for a friend, so hopefully we get back in time. I got word that this person isn't supposed to be in town until later that evening anyway, so that works out pretty good.&nbsp; Then the night before all that, the 26th, is the Viva La Bands Tour in Columbus. Pretty stoked about seeing CKmotherfuckingY.&nbsp; Not so much looking forward to Gwar. They kinda weird me&nbsp;out.&nbsp; I'm trying to get into&nbsp;Vains of Jenna, and Cradle of Filth is alright. But I still haven't decided if I'm getting there when doors open or&nbsp;not, or if I should just go for CKY. I'll make my decision after&nbsp;much iTunes listening LOL</p><p>Ummm so then Nov. 3 is our Halloween party....have no clue what I'm dressing up as this year.&nbsp; I need&nbsp;to figure that out pretty soon obviously.</p><p>A few cool things have happened since I last posted though. My letter to the editor of the local paper&nbsp;here in Fairfield got published.&nbsp; That was pretty exciting. Nothing better than knowing Engel was going to be reading it and getting pissed off that yet another former student was getting involved in school board issues. I wanted to&nbsp;go to the meeting tonight at the municipal building but they were giving&nbsp;out tickets, and I wouldn't have been able to make it at the beginning anyway. I'm waiting the dish on that though. I wonder if the two cowards even showed up. I'd be shocked if they actually answered questions.&nbsp; If they had actual facts, I don't know what I'd do other than faint.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, and I scored a 100 on my last German test. That was good. Totally wasn't expecting it.&nbsp; Mad that profs haven't posted midterm grades though, only my geology prof did. I have an A in there, so it's nice to know I have two A's at the moment (I'm pretty sure I have one in German too).&nbsp; I am guessing I have a B in SOC 358, and I don't even want to know what I have in the other soc class. I don't even want to see my midterm exam grade. I will probably find out tomorrow though. Pray for my soul, please. I'm not too optimistic about it. And I need this class for my major so I need a C or better. Hell damn fart. Or rather, ""FUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK MEEEEEEE INNNN THEEEEE ASSSSSSSSHOOOOOLLLLEEEEEE""<br /><br /><br />Other than that I am just taking on my mom's duties this week. She is in Disney World for the week with my grandma, aunt, uncle and little cousin (Haley). It's Haley's first trip there and I wanted to go but couldn't due to school. I have fall break this Friday, but getting there on a Friday and leaving Sunday isn't really worth it.&nbsp; I didn't think I could get out of my Thursday night class otherwise I would have just flown out Wednesday evening. Oh well. We're gonna go again when she's a bit older anyway.&nbsp; Space/Splash Mountain, here I come!!!<br /><br />So this week has just been a lot of cooking for me and my dad, doing lots of dishes, cleaning up around the house, taking care of the cats, and all the other responsibilities that go on in a normal day.&nbsp; It's exhausting.&nbsp; Now I know what my mom really goes through. For some reason it's never really hit me the other times she's been on vacation and I've done all this, but then again I'm cooking and cleaning a lot more and actually in college this time, so that's probably why.&nbsp; More work to be done.&nbsp; It's also taking a toll on me mentally. I've been very anxious this week, worrying about me, my dad, etc. But that's normal. Just not having my mom here is furthering that. But I think I'm handling it pretty well. I did well today. I just find ways to distract myself and have fun.<br /><br />Then tonight Amanda's mom called and said her dog Snookie, who she's had forever, died last night.&nbsp; That was pretty depressing. She was such a sweet dog.&nbsp; I think she's gonna get another one sometime though, so I think that will help. But we're going for margaritas tomorrow night as usual, which we'll both be in dire need of!!<br /><br /><br />Well I need to get to bed. I have to be up at 8 a.m. to stick my diabetic cat and jet off to the most boring class of the day.&nbsp; Thank God for fall break Friday!&nbsp; And Sophie's glaring at me because my typing is keeping her awake.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Buenos noches, mis amigos.<br /><br />P.S. - Beyond The Fall kick mucho ass.

Finally over freaking bronchitis. Still dealing with the remains of allergies but I guess that's what I have to look forward to until frost. *sigh*

I'm addicted to LA Ink now. I downloaded the episode with Frank (HOLY CRAP THE CUTENESS IS ALMOST TOO MUCH) and am now in the process of downloading the rest of the season so far.&nbsp; I love Kat and the gang there. If I had the money I'd LOVE to fly out there and have one of them do my tat that I'm currently planning, but that doesn't seem likely.&nbsp; But getting back to that, I started drawing off a rough sketch of what I want. This one is going on my lower back, and it's my most personal tattoo idea to date.&nbsp; I'm gonna put out word on here, MySpace, Facebook, etc. for anyone artistically inclined and interested in helping me design it.&nbsp; So if you yourself are artistic or you know someone who is and you want to try your hand at making me a design, let me know and I'll give you the details of what I'm looking for. I won't be getting it until next year sometime, but I'm planning ahead. I can't wait! I'm gonna do my two wrist tats this year probably. I'm also thinking about getting a half sleeve eventually at some point in life.&nbsp; That didn't go over very well with my mom. She got really pissed about it.&nbsp; She just keeps telling me how horrible my tattoos are gonna look when I get married and when I get old. First of all, I'm not even gonna have a traditional wedding OR wedding dress (it's gonna be black and red). Second, they are special pieces that I think long and hard about so I WON'T regret them in the future.&nbsp; They represent life events and revelations that are important to me and I wish she could understand that.&nbsp; She thinks tons of tats look really trashy and that I'm gonna look back on them and wish I didn't get them. Whatever. I know in my heart that I won't, so we'll discuss it more. Tattoos are not something I take lightly because they are so permanent.

Anyway, I have a German exam tomorrow night (or I guess technically it would be tonight now) and I'm pretty scared. I got an A on the first one but it's gotten so much harder.&nbsp; This definite article crap and gender agreement combined is confusing as hell.&nbsp; I'm gonna study all day tomorrow (I say that now haha) so wish me luck on that. If I get better than a 70 something on this one I'll be overjoyed.

Alright. I kinda got myself on&nbsp;a downer note now that I read over this entry, but thankfully Conan is on now. He's good at cheering me up.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear in a tortilla in Mexico."

So I have something I need to get off my chest NOW.&nbsp; Because when anger sits inside you and festers it's just not good for anyone.


So I'm reading the local newspaper (Fairfield Echo) this afternoon, and who should I come across, but my FAVORITE Fairfield resident, Mr. Arnold Engel.&nbsp; For those of you who don't live here, or didn't go to FHS, he's a member of the school board and some ridiculous group called CARE that keep trying to make themselves look good but anyone of us with some ounce of common sense know what their real agenda is.&nbsp; So basically, a few years back we faced a crisis of needing a levy voted on, or else they would cut funding, resulting in teacher's getting less salary, our extra-curricular activities being cut, yadda yadda yadda.&nbsp; Now I could go on about the shit he's pulled with us in the past, like literally trying to egg us on into going off on him while he was filming our school's band practice in the parking lot so he could show video proof of the students taking a stand against him.&nbsp; Then about a week ago I hear he's trying to sue a former student simply because she wrote a letter to the editor disagreeing with him.&nbsp; We'll come back to this in a bit. But when I read the letter he wrote in today's edition, and the people agreeing with him (makes me want to fucking VOMIT) and then thankfully, someone with good sense to call him out on his shit (careful, he might be the next one getting sued!!), I had to vent.

Look, a good deal of us know that the money we're giving to the school isn't being spent in the ways that it should (you can most likely thank the superintendent for that, as the rumors are that he used a good deal of it for himself. Not a fact, just a rumor, but I wouldn't be surprised).&nbsp; Now obviously I don't agree with that.&nbsp; And I wouldn't support a school levy that was asking for more money if he was simply squandering it all on himself and useless things instead of where it was really needed.&nbsp; However, I'm getting so sick of hearing about other schools now going through the same thing--unless their levy passes, they have to cut acitivities or go by the pay-to-play method, where you would have to pay absurd amounts of money just to play a sport or belong to a club. Now this was the system we had at first--can you believe that we had to pay $200 some dollars just to belong to the fucking art club!?!&nbsp; Even Helen Keller can see something wrong with that.&nbsp; Now thankfully when our levy passed, our money was refunded, but still. FUCKING INSANE.&nbsp; And THEN, when that whole mess was going on, people were saying that our teachers didn't deserve to be paid any more than they were making.&nbsp; Hell, they don't make as much as they deserve in the first place, and you wanted to reduce that even further? WTF!?!&nbsp;&nbsp; They claimed that the teachers weren't really doing their job and some of the students were apparently ratting out certain things teachers did in the classroom.&nbsp; Bullshit, utter bullshit.

So anyway, getting to now.&nbsp; It is absolutely ridiculous that this man would sue a former student simply because her views are not shared by Mr. Engel.&nbsp; God forbid we have an opinion, I mean we're ONLY students who actually go there and live with everything there, and he's only a guy who goes by what other people tell him.&nbsp; God forbid we actually speak our minds! Fine, perhaps we should all just let him make all the decisions for us, because clearly the city and the school system would be better off if he was responsible for all the decisions.&nbsp; Perhaps we should just make Fairfield a fucking dictatorship and we will all worship him and bow before him and kiss his feet.

Now that I've said that, there could be consequences. I could fucking care less. I really could. If he or anyone who knows him reads this, I'm sure he'll be inclined to write yet another letter to the paper denouncing the students and former students, since we are products of the school system.&nbsp; So you say Mr. Engel that you are NOT a student hating group? So that explains why you will sue anyone who dares to voice an opinion opposed to yours, and why you came to our school's band practice one afternoon, videotaped the practice, and when the students were walking back up into the parking lot and they decided to yell at you, and you most likely showed this video to all of your cronies (deny it all you want, that's all you and your people are) so you could show what horrible and rebellious students we are.&nbsp; Oh, and it's also why you called our 2004 class president a ""political terrorist"" (yes those were your exact words). Can you imagine calling a mere high school student a political terrorist? I'd think about the real political terrorists in this world before going around placing that false label on a high school student.&nbsp;

You are a JOKE, Mr. Engel.&nbsp; I feel sorry for your son that he has to live with all this criticism against you, I understand it must be hard and I feel for him having to put up with all that undue stress. Pity that all the criticism's true.&nbsp; And I noticed on that oh so lovely Facebook group we used to have dedicated to you that he so valiantly tried to defend you. Congrats on brainwashing him along with part of the rest of the city and the school board.

I guess I better be careful.&nbsp; I might get sued now! Oh the horrors.&nbsp; But in the very unlikely event that it happens, just know that I have no remorse for what I've written, and make no apologies, and will make no apologies, for I have the guts to stand for what I believe to be right and true.&nbsp; And unlike SOME people, I won't go around throwing lawsuits at anyone who disagrees with this."

"event","<p><font size=""7"">JESUS EFFING CHRIST PROJEKT REVOLUTION!!!!!<br /></font><br /><font size=""2"">I can't even type in&nbsp;normal coherent sentences.&nbsp; That's how motherfucking good this concert was!!<br /></font><br />So here is a looooong recap of my day.<br /><br />5 a.m.- I cannot sleep. I am&nbsp;too damn&nbsp;excited to go to sleep. So I eventually drift off around 5:30 or so.&nbsp; I decided to skip class and sleep until 10:30.&nbsp; Get up, get dressed, hair, makeup,&nbsp;pack, etc.</p><p>11:55 a.m. - We head out for Indiana.&nbsp; Ends up only being a two hour drive.&nbsp; We make&nbsp;it to the hotel, take it easy.&nbsp; At this point I am not feeling all that great from&nbsp;falling asleep in the car with the air conditioning turned off.&nbsp; So I down a bottle of water and scarf a pack of peanut m&amp;ms down my throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2:40 p.m.- We leave for&nbsp;the venue.&nbsp; We take a wrong turn and end up driving down some road full of cornfields.&nbsp; We turn around and decide to ask a highway&nbsp;patrolman who is directing traffic if we are going the right way.&nbsp; He says nothing, just points.&nbsp; Dad and I proceed to make fun of him after we have driven away, and wondering if&nbsp;perhaps we bought him a donut if he'd talk then.</p><p>&nbsp;3:00 p.m.- Arrive at PR!!! Say goodbye to Dad at the gate and prepare for my first concert alone (Zach never answered me back about going).&nbsp; I head in and start looking around for the revolution stage, because I want to see MSI go on.&nbsp; I follow a bunch of people heading that way, and when I see it I am in awe of just how tiny that stage is! But I continue following some people and end up securing a decent spot in the middle of the crowd.&nbsp;<br /><br />3:05 ish?- MSI come on, AND ROCK THE FUCKING PLACE!! I'll be honest, I never cared much for their music before, just from listening to it on iTunes.&nbsp; But they are AMAZING live and I loved the band themselves, but now I have had ""Shut Me Up"" stuck in my head since last night and I am going on a mass downloading spree tonight which they shall be apart of.&nbsp; Jimmy's in between song banter was PRICELESS.&nbsp; I am kind of in love with that man.&nbsp; He shall be added to my heroes list.&nbsp; He came out in his usual pink and black attire.&nbsp; At one point he was in a wheelchair, another time he put on pink fairy wings and hopped around the stage, he came out and twirled a baton while singing ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", he declared that it wasn't ""gothy enough"" so he opened a black umbrella, and he shoved his pants down to his ankles because we sang loud enough for him. Lyn-Z was equally amazing, doing her infamous backbend and jumping into the crowd.&nbsp; I only wish I could've been up there.&nbsp; She's gorgeous! I'm straight and all, but if I weren't, I'd totally hit that XD.&nbsp; I'd be fighting Gerard for her.&nbsp; Or I could just settle on having a threesome with both of them. Yeah, I like that idea the best XD<br />As far as hilarious things Jimmy Urine said, here's what I recall:<br />""This is like a motherfuckin' Backstreet Boys concert out here!"" *begins singing cheesy boybandish madeup song*<br />""This sounds like High School Musical!""<br />""We come from the future"" *crowd cheers* ""Trust me, it's not that fucking great!""<br />""Now I know a lot of you came here to cheat on your boyfriends and girlfriends, but guess what? I'M TELLING ON YOU""<br />*after he puts up black gothy umbrella he begins singing* ""Ooohhh....it's soo gothy.....we're gonna cry together, and our mascara's gonna smearrrrrr...""<br />""Welcome all you people from the middle of nowhere! You guys are great! You'll fuck anybody, that's why we love you! Even I can get laid!""<br />*after Lyn-Z jumps into the crowd* ""Bassist for sale......only 40(some unit of money).....bass is extra....may not like you once you get her home""<br />""I'd love to answer you, but I don't speak douchebag""<br />*does a little thing where he speaks in an outrageously horrible french accent*<br />That's all I can remember offhand...then he had us all scream ""FUCK CHICAGO"" into his little dictaphone thing so he could play it for those nice Chicagoans at today's show LOL<br /><br />4ish or almost 4ish- MSI end, and I head for nourishment.&nbsp; Buy a bottle of water, grab a pretzel and cheese, and scarf it down.&nbsp; I decide to walk around a bit just to see what's there, and that's when I finally see the buses.&nbsp; Of course security is patrolling the gates, but a small group of people are lined up.&nbsp; I decide to go sit down near there and hang out until Placebo is set to go on. Unfortunately I don't see anyone, so after Julien K appears to be over I head into the main pavilion and grab my spot in the pit, complete with my nifty yellow wristband (that I am STILL proudly wearing).&nbsp; I am about seven to nine rows back from the stage.&nbsp; The view is AMAZING.&nbsp; I have never in my life been so close to the stage, so the $75 was sooo worth it! I mean I could actually see their faces and everything! So I get in there just in time for Placebo.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Placebo is great! I've liked them for a few months, so this was my first time seeing them live.&nbsp; Brian Molko is way too adorable.&nbsp; When that boy smiles....oh my god. (As Katie would say, GURNEY!!XD) It should be illegal how cute he is.&nbsp; The other guitarist/bassist (not entirely sure which) was amusing as well, during the beginning of one song he went into this weird ass mystical dance kinda thing, where he shook his butt and waved his arms around.&nbsp; It was pretty funny.&nbsp; The only thing that pissed me off about their set was that they didn't play ""Infra-Red"" which is my favorite.&nbsp; Here's what they played that I can remember:<br />*Meds<br />*Special K<br />*Every You Every Me<br />*The Bitter End<br /><br />Then I patiently wait for HIM to come on.&nbsp; And they do.&nbsp; Ville comes out and they launch into it.&nbsp; I love Ville and all, but first of all, where is this pelvis shaking you promised us? and two, brother needs to eat a Big Mac or two.&nbsp; He's always been skinny, but he's starting to resemble Nicole Richie.&nbsp; It definitely wasn't the best HIM performance I've seen, but it was good. They've never been a very active band on stage, so this wasn't much different. They played:<br />*Passion's Killing Floor<br />*Wings of a Butterfly<br />*Vampire Heart<br />*Sweet Six Six Six<br />*Killing Loneliness<br />*Wicked Game<br />*Kiss of Dawn<br />*And some other song that I know I've heard but couldn't place it<br /><br />Then it's time for TBS!! I was very excited because I'd been looking so forward to seeing them for my first time.&nbsp; And they did not disappoint! Now, this was however the same time that a group of drunk guys entered the pit and begin pissing everyone off with their thrashing and trying to start shit.&nbsp; Now I LOVE mosh pits, I LOVE to jump around and head bang, but when it resorts to just pushing and shoving everyone, that's when it sucks.&nbsp; And that happened for the entire rest of the show.&nbsp; Adam Lazzara was absolutely amazing and gorgeous and all that shiz.&nbsp; I completely LOL'ed @ his Harry Potter comment (""That's some serious shit right there!"").&nbsp; They did:<br />*A Decade Under the Influence<br />*I think they did Cute Without the 'E'<br />*Liar (Takes One to Know One)<br />*And of course ended with Make Damn Sure, which I nearly lost my voice screaming along to.&nbsp; They also played other songs but seeing as I am a more recent TBS fan, as in only since about spring, I didn't know those songs.&nbsp; But they were fun and I'm gonna go download them.<br /><br />And then, the moment I have been waiting for since the tour dates were announced in May: MCFUCKIN'R!! I was so excited I was almost dancing waiting for them to come on.&nbsp; A little earlier, before TBS I think, I decided to text one of those messages to the screen.&nbsp; I never saw mine come up, though it may have come up before Linkin Park (We'll get to why I didn't stay for them).&nbsp; So if anyone there saw ""Scream if u love Frerard!!"" that was me!! XD<br /><br />So the screens go blank, the crowd goes ape shit, and the fire begins coming out on stage.&nbsp; I am now screaming so loud and feel my heart beating so fast I think I am going to explode.&nbsp; Ray comes out first and I lose it :D&nbsp; Then the rest come out and I am making immediate glances at Gerard and Frank.&nbsp; I kept standing there going ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT GERARD WAY IS LIKE TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM MEEEE!!!""&nbsp; in my mind over and over.&nbsp; So he comes out, struts his stuff like his shit don't stink as usual, and launches into the first song.&nbsp; Every song is beyond amazing, the show is amazing, all five of them are amazing, and the crowd is now amazing, despite the addition of even more drunk college guys.&nbsp; The mosh pit becomes completely brutal, and I am now being thrown and shoved around and almost knocked over so many times I cannot count, but I don't care.&nbsp; I am jumping as high as I can repeatedly like a fucking maniac, and no matter how out of breath I get from singing and jumping at the same time, every time Gerard commanded us to jump, I obeyed willingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the moshing, though, I manage to move up a couple rows so I am now even closer! Oh, and BEST PART--Gerard threw his water bottle into the pit and I ALMOST caught it, but the guy literally right in front of me got it instead, but a lot of the water splashed all over me!! I HAVE VICARIOUSLY TOUCHED LIPS WITH GERARD WAY XD<br /><br />Sadly, there were no Frerard moments *uber sad face* and in fact Frank didn't really do a whole lot, he mostly stuck to&nbsp;his spot on the side.&nbsp; But he looked too gorgeous for words as always.&nbsp; Gerard wore two boas that fans threw up on stage, and at the end someone threw a red rose up and he put it in his teeth.&nbsp; He also did the usual ""Boys take off your shirts and swing them around"" thing before ""YKWTDTGLUIP"" and after one song, though I can't remember which, he did the most memorable thing of the night: He stood up on the speaker, shoved his hand down his pants, threw his head back and made moaning noises, then his fingers came out of one of the holes in his jeans, and he felt himself up through his pants. If you want to see it, I know at least one person who filmed it, so I'm sure it'll be on YouTube soon.&nbsp; He also did the blowjob microphone thing for a few seconds.<br /><br />Here's what they played:<br />*How I Disappear<br />*The Sharpest Lives<br />*I'm Not Okay<br />*Give 'Em Hell, Kid<br />*Dead!<br />*Famous Last Words<br />*Welcome to the Black Parade<br />*You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison<br />*Cancer<br />*Helena<br />*House of Wolves<br />*Mama<br />*Teenagers<br /><br /><br />So sadly the show ends, though I so desperately wish for it to not be over.&nbsp; It's at this point I cannot believe I still have a voice left.&nbsp; I screamed so damn much for Gerard and the boys that my vocal cords are surely plotting to destroy me.&nbsp; So then I left the pit, desperate for water and a place to rest my aching feet.&nbsp; I end up getting my merch (The white MCR shirt with the blood red letters and their poster) and then my water, and then I go to check out the gate again.&nbsp; I see about twenty to twenty five people around most of which are wearing MCR shirts.&nbsp; So I stand around and before I know it, two and a half hours have gone by and they are kicking us out of the venue because LP is over with. BUTTTT it was so worth it! I met some really amazing girls and boys and we stood/sat around and basked in the awesomeness that is the MCR fandom.&nbsp; It was so great to see MCR fans who weren't all fighting and arguing over love lives and who were just nice to everyone and welcoming and all that.&nbsp; So we exchanged myspace URLs with this one kid named Yaegel (I think I'm spelling that right?) by writing on his chest in silver sharpies XD<br /><br />So here's the other two reasons why waiting there until 11:25 p.m. was worth it: First, we met Nathan Leone (lead singer of Madina Lake who although I didn't see perform, they are good and I couldn't pass up the chance to meet him!)&nbsp; He came through the gate to go to the buses, and we recognized him as he approached.&nbsp; We asked if he would sign some stuff for us and he graciously obliged and came over for a few minutes and signed everything people gave him.&nbsp; He signed my arm (yeah I didn't really have anything for him to sign...) and it's still there in silver sharpie goodness.&nbsp; That man is not only immensely full of sexy goodness, but is SOOOOOOO incredibly nice! He signed everything, and when people told him how much they loved the band, he was very genuine with ""thank you so much, you don't know how much that means to us"" responses.&nbsp; I snapped a quick pic of him signing some stuff, and was going to ask for a pic but didn't want to keep him from doing whatever he was on his way to do any longer.&nbsp; So he waved to us and one guy next to me told him to go tell Jimmy Urine that he wanted to have sex with him and Nathan said he would definitely do that.&nbsp; Another girl told him to go drag Gerard's ass up here, and he was like ""Okay! I will tell him, like he listens to me, I'm his freaking mother!"" XD (apparently someone in Julien K had told another fan that Gee was sleeping already........take that how you will...we have our suspicions.&nbsp; You KNOW he was totally in there spooning with Frank :D)<br /><br />And SECOND, who should come up to the gate but the one and only WORM!!!!! I was freaking at this point, and some people wanted to take pics with him but he said he didn't like to take pictures but some did anyway LOL.&nbsp; Then some people were high-fiving him, so I said what the hell and did the same.&nbsp; I HIGH-FIVED WORM!!! (Is it sad that that made me happier than a 12 yr old at an N*Sync concert?).&nbsp; It was hilarious, because he looked at me with my hand in the air like ""WTF?"" for a second then high fived me.&nbsp; ILY, WORM!! &lt;3 Then he looked like he was counting us, so we were in dire hope that he would bring someone up to see us, but alas it never happened.<br /><br />So to sum the rest of that experience up, we made fun of the security guards (one didn't mind that one girl kept calling him jackass and douchebag XD), found one really awesome security guard that we were trying to bribe with anything we could think of, talked of our plan to link arms and storm the buses (some of us would have to take one for the team but they can't get all of us!!)........telling the cool guard that we'd be willing to hurt ourselves just to have to go to the medic area by the buses.....and hearing about other sightings.&nbsp; We swear we saw Bob, and we shouted his name and he looked up, but didn't come up or anything.&nbsp; Everytime a golf cart whizzed past we cheered, hoping it'd be someone.&nbsp; Everytime someone in a hoodie approached, we held our breaths. There were also reported sightings of Frank and Cortez, but they weren't confirmed.&nbsp; I also really wanted to meet Jimmy Urine, but we couldn't find him anymore.&nbsp; I SOOO would have been one of those who'd pay to make out with him XD<br /><br />Then I waited until midnight to be picked up (my dad got lost hahaha) and then we left at noon today to come back here.<br /><br />So, all in all, FUCKING BEST CONCERT EVER, had a great time, despite being sorer than I have ever been in my entire 21 years on the planet, and terribly sunburnt, and putting up with freezing my ass off for 2 1/2 hours last night at the gate. I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat. SO WORTH IT!!!&nbsp; Oh and for anyone wondering, I don't recall any ""declarations of love"" from Gerard unless I missed it, and I couldn't tell what the hell he had written on him or Lyn-Z.&nbsp; Someone said both their knuckles said ""I love you"" but I couldn't tell.<br /><br />Oh, and pics.&nbsp; I promise I will have those uploaded tonight, as well as my videos.&nbsp; Warning about the videos- not the greatest, since I was being knocked around in the pit brutally, and there is no sound on them, but you do get to see Gee acting like a lovably retarded spazz on stage :D<br /><br />One last thing: Hearing a 47 year old woman call Gerard ""Gee"" made me squee inside.<br /><br />Fini.<br /></p>"

"event","Alright, so the loveliness that is school aka Sing Sing (yes I often liken school to prison XD) started again Monday.&nbsp; It's going alright so far.&nbsp; All my profs are great.&nbsp; There's one who I swear to god sounds like Weird Al.&nbsp; And his eyes get really big when he talks.&nbsp; It amuses me to no end.

Ummm what else.&nbsp; I saw The Simpsons Movie Monday night.&nbsp; It was pretty damn hilarious.&nbsp; If the fact that it's the Simpsons doesn't lure you to it, the fact that Green Day have cameos in the beginning should.&nbsp; All I can say is, poor poor poor Tre Cool XD

Tonight was a pretty interesting night.&nbsp; So my mom and I went to Rick's Tavern with my friend's mom, as we go there every Thursday night.&nbsp; So we get there, and there are all these older guys sitting at the table behind us, and my friend's mom (Debbie) was talking to them.&nbsp; The main guy there, Guy aka Tony, was getting drunker and drunker as he downed one Corona after another, and when the waitress brought him another, he sat down at our table.&nbsp; He kept joking around with us and telling me how damn cute my smile was and literally was pinching my cheeks saying ""YOU'RE SOOOO CUUUUUTEEE!""&nbsp;&nbsp;And I wanted to smack him but oh well. It was entertaining to say the least.&nbsp; So long story short, three rum and cokes later, I'm doing karaoke singing ""I Got You Babe"" horribly with one of the guys who was at least in his late 40s.&nbsp; We butchered it of course, but it was fun.&nbsp; I wish I had had a few more rum and cokes though.&nbsp; We ended not leaving until like 11:30 p.m.&nbsp; So yeah.......weird evening.

I am uber excited for PR next Friday.&nbsp; I still don't know who is taking my other ticket, which makes me a little nervous.&nbsp; The friend I usually go to all concerts with hasn't answered me, so I'm gonna take it as a no....guess I'm gonna have to send out a MySpace bulletin advertising it.&nbsp; I really hate going to concerts alone.&nbsp; I need someone to talk to in between sets!&nbsp; And you know, to keep me from dying and all.&nbsp; I should probably just hijack an IV from the hospital and hook it up to my arm before hand. Think the bands would notice me then? XD

I really should get to bed, seeing as I have to be up at the grand ol' hour of 7:30.&nbsp; At least I can home and sleep tomorrow, I only have one class on Fridays.&nbsp; Then tomorrow is the first of many Oktoberfest celebrations around here, there are at least two more in the coming months.&nbsp; Since our ancestry is German, and we love German food, we always go to them.&nbsp; So naturally I'm excited that I can actually order good German beer for the first time and get blitzed!

I really want popcorn. With butter. Damn alcohol munchies."

"event","<p>So I'm currently reading this amazing book called Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert, and I had to share this passage.&nbsp; Because it has given me insight into something I personally struggled with since Fall of 2005, and while I've gotten over it, when I read this, it just gave me such a fresh perspective on the whole situation of mine.&nbsp; I mean, nearly two years ago around this time (or more Septemberish I believe) I was a deeply depressed mental and physical wreck.&nbsp; It took me several months to start to come out of it, and about a year before I was really truly over it.&nbsp; So here's the passage.&nbsp; Basically, she (Liz) is talking with her friend Richard, who she has met in an ashram in India. (By the by, ""Groceries"" is his nickname for her):<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""But I really loved him.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Big deal.&nbsp; So you fell in love with someone.&nbsp; Don't you see what happened?&nbsp; This guy touched a place in your heart deeper than you were capable of reaching.&nbsp; I mean you got zapped, kiddo.&nbsp; But that love you felt, that's just the beginning.&nbsp; You just got a taste of love.&nbsp; That's just limited little rinky-dink mortal love.&nbsp; Wait till you see how much more deeply you can love than that.&nbsp; Heck, Groceries -- you have the capacity to someday love the whole world.&nbsp; It's your destiny.&nbsp; Don't laugh.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm not laughing.""&nbsp; I was actually crying.&nbsp; ""And please don't laugh at me now, but I think the reason it's so hard for me to get over this guy is because I seriously believed David was my soul mate.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He probably was.&nbsp; Your problem is you don't understand what that word means.&nbsp; People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants.&nbsp; But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that's holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life.&nbsp; A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake.&nbsp; But to live with a soul mate forever?&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp; Too painful.&nbsp; Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then they leave.&nbsp; And thank God for it.&nbsp; Your problem is, you just can't let this one go.&nbsp; It's over, Groceries.&nbsp; David's purpose was to shake you up, drive you out of that marriage that you needed to leave, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light could get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you had to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master and beat it.&nbsp; That was his job, and he did great, but now it's over.&nbsp; Problem is, you can't accept that this relationship had a real short shelf life.&nbsp; You're like a dog at the dump, baby -- you're just lickin' at an empty can, trying to get more nutrition out of it.&nbsp; And if you're not careful, that can's gonna get stuck on your snout forever and make your life miserable.&nbsp; So drop it.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""But I love him.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""So love him.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""But I miss him.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""So miss him.&nbsp; Send him some love and light every time you think about him, and then drop it.&nbsp; You're just afraid to let go of the last bits of David because then you'll really be alone, and Liz Gilbert is scared to death of what will happen if she's really alone.&nbsp; But here's what you gotta understand, Groceries.&nbsp; If you clear out all that space in your mind that you're using right now to obsess about this guy, you'll have a vacuum there, an open spot--a doorway.&nbsp; And guess what the universe will do with that doorway?&nbsp; It will rush in--God will rush in--and fill you with more love than you ever dreamed.&nbsp; So stop using David to block that door.&nbsp; Let it go.""<br />&nbsp; ""But I wish me and David could--""<br />&nbsp; He cuts me off.&nbsp; ""See, now that's your problem.&nbsp; You're wishin' too much, baby.&nbsp; You gotta stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone oughtta be.""<br /><br /><br />So there it is.&nbsp; It really made me stop and think about the situation I went through, because I was feeling the same exact way that they were describing throughout their conversation about someone, and now, looking back on the whole thing, I've come to Richard's same conclusion about soul mates and clearing your mind of the obsession.&nbsp; If anyone is interested in reading this book, it's about a woman (the author) who gets divorced in her mid thirties, has a rebound relationship with a guy who she falls deeply for but it doesn't work out as they are not actually good for each other in many ways, and so she decides to spend an entire year traveling.&nbsp; She spends four months in Italy, learning about and savoring pleasure (mainly through food!), four months in India, where she is learning about devotion through meditation and yoga at an ashram, and then four months in Bali where she tries to learn to balance both pleasure and devotion in her life.&nbsp; It's very eye opening and humorous, so I highly recommend it.<br /><br />And just as a random last note for the evening:<br /><br />""I forgot the hand sanitizer""<br />""FUCK YOUUUUU""<br /></p>"

"event","<p>Okay, so I've neglected my LJ for the last few weeks, but there' s a good excuse for that, and that is one of constant traveling and general laziness.<br /><br />First up, the trip to New York was....alright. Not as fun as I expected it to be, but then again, nothing's that fun when you're sick the entire trip. That lovely little stomach bug eased off the day we left, then hit me again with even more force by the second day.&nbsp; I felt like such shit. I didn't even eat dinner that night.<br /><br />The worst part of the trip by far was having to endure my first ever stays in motels.&nbsp; Now, the main one we stayed in, in Niagra, was pretty decent.&nbsp; It was at least fairly clean and cozy for a motel, and the owners were extremely nice. But still, with my cleanliness issues, it didn't meet my expectations. But I dealt with it.&nbsp; Now the first one, which was located on the northeastern Ohio/northwestern Pennslyvania border, was HORRENDOUS.&nbsp; Anything stereotypical about motels you've ever heard or seen...yeah, that was pretty much it.&nbsp; It reeked of cigarette smoke, there were holes and rips in the bed and the mattress, the TV was kinda broken, the water smelled, there were stains on the carpet, etc.&nbsp; I almost decided to go sleep in the van that night, but I curled up with MY blanket over me and went to sleep. God knows I probably got the HIV from those sheets.</p><p>Anyway, we stayed in the town of Niagra, where, you guessed it, the Falls are.&nbsp; We spent time above the falls, where the rapids run, and we went to a little area called Three Sisters, which are three little connected island type arrangements where the water rushes by.&nbsp; It was hot, despite being by rushing water.&nbsp; Then we spent a bit of time down by the American Falls and the American side of the Horseshoe Falls, which is the main stretch of the falls.&nbsp; Later that afternoon, I accomplished a lifelong dream of mine....crossing the border to CANADA!! Even if it was only the Falls area, which is insanely crowded and touristy, I was so thrilled to finally be there. Toronto was about an hour and a half away or so, so maybe next time we can side trip up to there.&nbsp; Anyway, I gambled for my first time in Canada.&nbsp; I ended up with beginner's luck and won $100! That was pretty exciting.&nbsp; The funniest thing that happened in Canada was when we were crossing the border, and they told us to pull over so our van could be inspected/questioned.&nbsp; Well, the Canadian border guard was convinced we were some redneck, gun toting Americans, and asked us like five times whether we were carrying firearms.&nbsp; He also was quick to remind us that if he searched the vehicle and found firearms, we would spend the night in Canadian jail.&nbsp; We offered to let him search the van by all means, but he didn't.&nbsp; He was butt of our future jokes.&nbsp; It made us want to purchase a gun in Canada just to make him happy.<br /><br />The next day my dad and&nbsp;I took a trip on the Maid of the Mist boat tours.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;a boat that takes you down actually close up to the Falls, so you're all in the mist and whatnot.&nbsp; It was pretty amazing.&nbsp; I managed to get sunburnt too. AT FRICKING NIAGRA FALLS. I always manage to have the most special talents.<br /><br />Saturday we left in the afternoon, and ate at this really great place in New York called Hideaway Bay.&nbsp; Everyone except me (because I was still sick) got really drunk and couldn't stop laughing.&nbsp; I've never seen my uncle and grandma laugh like they did. It was pretty silly.&nbsp; Then we piled back into the van, where they sang Christmas carols to keep my uncle away, since he had three hours of driving to finish for the night.&nbsp; I stretched out in the back seat with my grandma and dozed.&nbsp; We eventually reached the Motel 6 in Medina, Ohio at 1:15 a.m.&nbsp; Now, going into the Motel 6 after the other two motels, was like walking into the Ritz Carlton.&nbsp; I was ecstatic.<br /><br />The next morning we continued back home to Fairfield, which was now only four hours away.&nbsp; Pennsylvania and northern Ohio have these really amazing gas stations called Sheetz.&nbsp; They rock.&nbsp; They have good food that you can order and all kinds of neat coffee flavors.&nbsp; We got home, went to a quick dinner, then Amanda and I went to Target to visit Amy and hangout for a bit.&nbsp; I blew some of my casino winnings on DVDs.<br /><br />The following week was a bit rough.&nbsp; I was no longer sick, but I was getting really short of breath all of a sudden.&nbsp; Monday was the worst day.&nbsp; Since it would let up at times, I assumed it was only my anxiety acting up, and maybe the weather fucking with my sinuses and whatnot.&nbsp; So Thursday I finally ended up going to the doctors, and after checking my oxygen levels and such, and feeling my legs for blood clots, she said she honestly wasn't worried, and it was most likely just my anxiety.&nbsp; And it must have been, because it let up the week we were in the Caymans. The rest of that week was spent hanging with Amanda, our friend James, and a new friend, Derek.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also saw Brandon one night that week, and Amy as well.<br /><br />Then there was the Caymans. It was so relaxing.&nbsp; I didn't want to leave, I could've definitely used another week down there.&nbsp; Did the same stuff as usual, lots of snorkeling, swimming in the ocean, tanning, drinking, etc.&nbsp; This time my dad and I rented waverunners.&nbsp; Those were a fucking blast! If you get the chance to rent one sometime, do it.&nbsp; It's like riding a motorcycle on the ocean, with the wind in your hair and roaring in your ears, water splashing in your face, and getting some airtime if you go fast enough like I was. I saw a few new fish, as well as the usual barracuda.&nbsp; We went to Stingray City for like the 4th or 5th time, and they mauled me practically.&nbsp; I was completely bombarded by them this time, but it was all good. Then we hit the second snorkeling stop on that outing, where we always get to spot the green moray eel that lives there, named Jimbo.&nbsp; He came thisclose to me, with his mouth slightly open. It was pretty scary for a few moments there.&nbsp; I'll post pics when I get them developed and scanned in.<br /><br />We met up with Amanda on Wednesday, as her cruise ship happened to stop there that day. We met up in Georgetown and went to lunch, and each had a drink.&nbsp; Then we walked on down to the Paradise bar where they drank some more and we got her in the ocean with the help of Zoe (LMAO) and I did some snorkeling.&nbsp; We also tried to freak her out by telling her what was swimming past her.&nbsp; After we took a stumbling Amanda back to port so she could get back on her ship, we went to the Royal Palms resort bar and had a drink and watched the Sunset.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We ate a lot of good food that trip, the best in the world in our opinion, and bought a lot of stuff (you know, the essentials, like liquor) and I stocked up on perfume, becoming a true perfume whore (I bought four because it's cheaper down there).&nbsp; I got really sunburnt the last day, and decided I was no longer Emily but a lobster. It was painful.&nbsp; Then we went to see the sunset again, had a drink, which due to not eating much beforehand really knocked me out, and I was sick for half of dinner.<br /><br />All in all, it was a awesome trip, and I'm back here now and back to updating and all that jazz.&nbsp; Projekt Rev is in 3 1/2 weeks, I can't wait!! SOOOOO EXCITED!!<br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>Oh, drunken Gee playing kickball, you never fail to bring teh LOLZ XD<br /><br />So I'm sitting here at 5:35 a.m. because I have been sick since Saturday afternoon with this lovely stomach/intestinal virus that's been going around. I don't have it as bad as some people I know have, considering I can eat, drink, have no fever, not vomiting, etc.&nbsp; But I still feel like crap. And it sucks.<br /><br />Yesterday was THE WORST since I've been sick, I literally stayed in bed ALL day except to go out for dinner, which surprisingly made me feel slightly better.&nbsp; Basically, I thought I was better Sunday night, because we went out to dinner with a bunch of people, and I was feeling almost normal again. I even went to bed early (!!!) at 3 a.m....only to wake up an hour later feeling like crap. I then cried for about ten minutes, cause I'm a pussy like that.&nbsp; Then I dozed off for about twenty odd minutes while the rest of American Pie 2 played on my PS2.&nbsp; I threw in the 4th season of Viva La Bam and fell back asleep.&nbsp; I got up finally at like 2:00 and ate some Panera for lunch then went back to sleep while watching my General Hospital.</p><p>Now, I've felt somewhat better since waking up for dinner, although I am quite tired now and wanting to try to lay down and fall asleep.&nbsp; So I'll be putting in a DVD in a minute, not sure what it will be this time.&nbsp; Maybe some Family Guy or Jackass.</p><p>Other than&nbsp;being sick, things have been good.&nbsp; Friday night two of my friends and I went to dinner and saw Ratatouille. It was pretty cute, and I think it's one of the better Pixar movies in my opinion.&nbsp; Saturday I was supposed to go with Amanda to her work picnic to go canoeing and whatnot, but that's when my tummy troubles hit and I had to cancel on that one.&nbsp; Other than that, been taking it easy by just watching movies and tv, taking nice hot baths, killing time by playing PS2 and mucking around on here looking at pointless shit.<br /><br />We are leaving for New York/Canadialand tomorrow (Wednesday) late morning I believe...I think we are staying somewhere overnight, not sure where though.&nbsp; Then we will get to Buffalo Thursday.&nbsp; Being on a road trip while being sick might not be the best of times, but I'm bringing plenty of stuff to keep me occupied and of course I can always sleep.&nbsp; Also, I'm bringing my SpongeBob blanket and my stuffed Patrick with me (I like cuddling with him XD)&nbsp;God I'm such a dork.<br /><br />We come back Monday I think, and I plan on taking massive pictures.&nbsp; I found out tonight there is talk of taking one of those boats out to the bottom of Niagra Falls, so if we do that, I'm fucking stoked!! Plus I get to gamble for the first time, and in another country no less!<br /><br />Well, I think I'm gonna head off for the night/morning.&nbsp; I'm gonna attempt to get some shuteye, even though I need to make two short trips at some point today.&nbsp; Just gonna take it easy today once again, and thank Buddha I only have to pack a carry on instead of that plus a fucking suitcase! (Of course that'll be next week!!)&nbsp; Wish me well, and send me yummy things and make me soup and hot pics of rocker boys and whatnot XD<br /><br />Oh, and as a last note, the Hairspray soundtrack to the new movie coming out is AMAZING<br /><br /></p>"

"event","Things are still going pretty good. Save for my fricking acid reflux. I really shouldn't have gone off my medicine for that.

I really need to get back to sleeping normally. I AM going to bed earlier tonight, I'm making a point of it.&nbsp; I'm tired of this sleeping all damn day, going to bed at 6 am-ish and not getting up until around three in the afternoon.&nbsp; I hate wasting my days like that, yet I've been in this cycle pretty much since Easter.&nbsp;

*sings* ""It endss tonighttt, it endss tonighttttttt.......""

So it's official, I am going to NY/Canadialand next weekend.&nbsp; We're leaving Thursday I believe and getting home Sunday, and we're driving, so it isn't a long trip by any means, but I'll get to see the Falls and a tiny bit of Canada, mainly some part that has casinos or something.&nbsp; And supposedly my unclem who is driving us in a van there, has some place he likes to stop that has good wine along the way. Road trip + good wine = heck yes.&nbsp; Eight hours of roadtripping each way = Ick.

Then the following weekend, the 27th, it's off to the Caymans, which I can't wait for.&nbsp; I love it down there, I feel so at peace when I;m in the ocean, snorkeling around and just floating on the water, looking down at all the amazing creatures swimming below and beside me.&nbsp; Amanda is going to be there one day on a cruise, so we shall meet up and get trashed.&nbsp; Blitzed on the Beach 2007 Edition! XD

Been hanging out with friends, and stuff with family, so that's been fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going cabrewing this Saturday afternoon, getting trashed Friday night with Amanda. Not sure what else will go down these next few weeks, hanging out wise.&nbsp; Fun will be had I'm sure.

Sometimes I really REALLY hate my iPod.&nbsp; Like when I charge him for several hours and then he decides that he isn't charged and the battery gives out.

I've&nbsp;been on a mass downloading spree these past two or three days.&nbsp; That and staying up online all night and doing nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;And dancing and singing along on my webcam for Lyss XD

So that's about it for this entry.&nbsp; And don't forget.&nbsp; Tonight's entry was brought to you by the letter G and the number 5.&nbsp;"

"event","Hope everyone's Fourth of Julys were fantabulous and all, and that no one blew themselves up.

I've been doing pretty good for myself lately, which is a feat unto itself.&nbsp; I've been keeping a much more positive attitude and ignoring a lot of little common problems and annoyances, and what do you know, it actually works! I've got quite a bit to be looking forward to this month as well, so that's helpful.&nbsp;

So last weekend was pretty amazing.&nbsp; My family and I participated in a reading party by this woman who is a clairvoyant, which means she can ""see"" spirits and communicate anything they bring through.&nbsp; She's not a psychic, not a fraud by any means.&nbsp; My mom has gone to her twice before and the things she found out were FAR too accurate and just plain freaky.&nbsp; Well, she won the chance to have a free reading party last weekend, so we attended.&nbsp; I was so full of nervous excitement.&nbsp; I was the second one to go.&nbsp; Basically you just go and sit with her, and she's very nice and comforting, and you sit with her for about half an hour and she just goes into this little trance like state by closing her eyes, and she tells you what she sees.&nbsp; So in the course of my session with her, she told me that these new interests I have taken on are what I should continue with and she sensed encouragement with those, and that basically I was on my way to doing what I should be doing.&nbsp; Which means my interest in a career in photography should continue and that hopefully this is what I was meant to do. I feel like it is.&nbsp; So then, she brought through three people.&nbsp; One was a child that she said she got the feeling was a contemporary of mine, someone I would have played with a lot when I was younger.&nbsp; The other information she gave on her doesn't fit, but it has made me wonder if maybe someone I knew when I was younger passed on and I don't know about it.&nbsp; I have someone in mind and am going to just browse the internet and see. I hope she hasn't passed on, but if she has, at least she is happy.&nbsp; This figure could also be someone from a past life or one of my guides.&nbsp; The second person we can't figure out either, but it is most likely someone in my family that I probably either didn't know or don't remember.&nbsp; We have ideas on who it might be but aren't for certain.&nbsp; The last person though, we are positive must have been my uncle who passed away in 1997.&nbsp; So that was really amazing to have this experience, and I am definitely going to have readings done in the coming years, as soon as I can.&nbsp;

My 4th was alright, I was a little sad that it ended so early (with everyone having to go to work today and all) and not getting to see Ethan (my cousin) but that's alright.&nbsp;&nbsp;

One of my best friends, Amanda, is coming in this week for three weeks, so I'm pumped about that.&nbsp; I get to go cabrewing next weekend with her and her mom, I might get to go to upstate New York and CANADIALAND (!!!!!) in about two weeks or so for a few days, and then at the end of the month we are going to the Cayman Islands. So this will be a kickass month.

In other news, THE MOTHERFUCKING SMASHING PUMPKINS ARE GOING TO PERFORM IN COLUMBUS, OHIO IN OCTOBER!!!!! And I want to go soooo badly.&nbsp; I HAVE to see them on their reunion tour!

Well I think that is all. I should go to bed, or at least settle into bed so I can nod off in the next few hours.&nbsp; I feel like shopping tomorrow possibly."

""Tarantula"" by the Smashing Pumpkins, ""Misery Business"" by Paramore, and ""Infra-Red"" by Placebo are pretty much the only three songs I've listened to in the last few hours. They are on constant repeat and I R OBSESSED.

And I can't shake the uncontrollable urge to dye my hair. NOW.

Don't get me wrong, I love my extensions (they're pink and black and underneath...just a few of them for those who don't know) and I want to keep them. And I know what look I want next. I'm gonna get it before vacation, which is at the end of July.&nbsp; I want to do blonde for the top half that fades down into dark, dark brown, and get some long sideswept bangs perhaps.&nbsp;

Then there's the urge to just start grabbing a plethora of colors and playing around. Oh well. I'll do that next time I suppose.&nbsp; I wanna go short at some point. Probably not this year, but we'll see, maybe by the end of the year.&nbsp; Which will be scary and you will all probably face my wrath of ""OMFG, WHAT HAVE I DONE TO MY BEAUTIFUL HAIRZ!!!!!111!!!""

Well, now that I spent like twenty minutes trying to find a reference pic to put up here, it's nearly 4 a.m., so I'm gonna hit the pillows and fall asleep to some Viva La Bam.&nbsp;

"event","<p>so it's been awhile since my last blog on here...thought i should check in.&nbsp; just been reeeeeal busy around here the last two to three weeks. </p><p>first there was our trip to colorado. my mom, grandma and i and a family friend all went out, my mom and i for a week and the others for two weeks.&nbsp; we went to a wedding and hung out with relatives out there. it was pretty fun, save for the aforementioned blog about the airport nightmare the day we got there.&nbsp; haley and i spent a lot of time together, being stupid and having fun. i love that i get to relive my childhood through her.&nbsp; it rained basically every day we were there, but that is normal colorado weather.&nbsp; and it wasn't all day rain, just showers here and there usually. the storms in colorado are amazing; because the area where we were is elevated due to the rocky mountains (about a mile above sea level, hence denver earning the nickname ""the mile high city""), the thunder is louder, literally shakes the foundation of whatever building you're in, and the lightning is <em>incredible</em>, so if you love thunderstorms, you need to visit colorado at some point.&nbsp; also, there are almost always rainbows through the storms if the sun happens to be out, and i have never seen so many in one day before! we saw FIVE rainbows in one afternoon, and two of those times were both double rainbows. it was insane. i also got pretty smashed on coconut rum &amp; cokes one night....ugh. stumbling into the hotel room at night buzzed and nauseous = not so fun. </p><p>so then after we left colorado a week later, those same relatives came in for a week here. my cousin sandra, who lives in england now, surprised us all by coming in for that week also. while everyone was in, we spent time swimming, going to the zoo, going to king's island, going out to dinner, etc. one night we all got really drunk at applebee's on beer. good times.</p><p>haven't been feeling so great since last week, but starting to feel a bit better now. blew some things out of proportion as i tend to do...and yeah. ended up in the emergency room monday morning because i was in so much pain (four times in only six months? gotta be some kind of a record right?) but nothing was found. whatever. still dealing with all this panic shit. it comes and goes unfortunately. i wish it would just go for good. it's been putting a strain on my relationship with my mom once again, as it always does. and by the time we repair that and start having fun again together, it returns and sends us back into that vicious cycle. i am starting to fear it will never end and that i will never overcome this. it's the most difficult thing i've ever had to deal with. le sigh.</p><p>soooooo.....trying to pick myself back up, laugh, and have fun again though it is proving hard when you are in pain everyday both physically and emotionally and not knowing why you keep feeling sick all the time.&nbsp; it's like i have this semblance of hope....yet at the same time i have this underlying bad feeling...not so much a feeling that something's wrong as a feeling that i'm just going to be miserable all summer and i definitely don't want that, nor could i stand to go through this entire next three months like this. sometimes i feel like i am just going to completely lose it and go crazy, homer simpson style. except without the whole axe wielding trying to kill people thing.</p><p>i have been in much better spirits the past two days at least so i suppose that's progress. i think another big part is that last summer and last fall, when this all started, i had people around all the time who got me out and actually gave me a life to experience and enjoy.&nbsp; i had cousins that i hung out with almost every day and who kept me in amazing spirits, but they unfortunately live far away now. and with not all my high school friends coming home this summer due to internships, vacations, etc., i don't foresee this year being as active, so i'm trying to think of how i can change that. </p><p>enough with the negativity, i'm gonna end this entry and watch some tv to make me laugh and continue surfing teh internets!</p><p>and this quote made me day yesterday. it's not word for word, but i'll paraphrase it:</p><p>""I'm really glad to be shaking my pelvis for those who haven't seen me do it yet."" - Ville Valo</p><p>how can you not love that man? HOW?! XD</p>"

"event","It's been a hell of&nbsp;long day, and while I should be sleeping, I'm also sick with God knows what, so I'll be up until I can fall asleep. Ugh. It's 1:50 a.m. <em>my </em>time, but it's two hours behind here.&nbsp; So I'm chilling on le laptop, watching Conan. Squee<br /><br /><br />So here's my day: Wake up at 9:30 a.m. to finish packing. Leave for airport at 10:30 a.m.&nbsp; Feel like crud the whole time.&nbsp; Then board our plane at 1:30ish.&nbsp; SUPPOSED to arrive in Denver at 2:21 p.m., instead get stuck in holding pattern for 40 minutes over Colorado due to bad storms in Denver.&nbsp; Airport is closed, so we are redirected to Colorado Springs which is 3 1/2 hours from where we will be staying.&nbsp; Have to refuel there, and wait until 6 something to leave for Denver.&nbsp; Finally arrive in Denver way late, miss out on the 7:25 shuttle to where my aunt will be picking us up, grab the 8:20 one, FINALLY get to our hotel at 10:30 p.m.! When we should have been there at like 4 in the afternoon...le sigh.<br /><br />So besides being sick and being frustrated with air travel, I am okay.&nbsp; I've no clue what's wrong with me, I feel fluish again, but I don't think the flu's going around anymore.&nbsp; So who knows.&nbsp; But I've been nibbling on food when I can, finally got some protein in me about fifteen minutes ago via a cheeseburger, and have been drinking plenty of fluids. No fever, so that's a plus.&nbsp; Just icky feeling. Sure it will pass within the week, as it's not the first time I've dealt with this. I think my anxiety/panic attacks are contributing to it as well, so that never helps.&nbsp; Oh wells, I am excited to have my wireless internet back, if only for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Going to try to go to bed now, we'll see how that goes. Otherwise I'll be on here once again."

"event","<p>So apparently the jackass I've been mooching wireless internet off of has a) figured me out and banned me, or b) encountered a problem with his own connection and therefore screwing me over as well.&nbsp; Or perhaps my computer just wants to be an asshole. Either way, the earliest&nbsp;I will return to non dial-up access is Tuesday, when I head off for Colorado for a week and I presume the hotel has wifi access. If not, there are places in town I'm sure that do.&nbsp; Unless it magically decides to start working again.</p><p>Emily ish pished mucho at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think&nbsp;I may have to take out some aggression in the form of Burnout 3 on the good ol' PS2.</p>"

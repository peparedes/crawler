<b>2nd Period</b>: Writing isnt that bad, they call me Lila from hey arnold...dont I just look so innocent? yeah..right.

<b>3rd Period</b>: Math, I actually have a 3.5 in that class..I didnt know I was that good at math lol. But i hate the class as a whole...I cant stand the people in it, they all think they can rule the world with a finger.

<b>4th Period</b>: History, I dont know what went on, I was too busy doing my science work to care.

<b>5th Period</b>: English..its incredible that I have a damn <u><b>C</u></b> I cant believe it...and its my favorite subject..damn it, Im getting lazy.

<b>6th Period</b>: Science, We took a test, it wasnt that bad..I think i might have gotten a good grade. Im so scared of my grade in that class :(

<b>After School</b>: Stayed for class of 07. Didnt do anything. Meeting was cancelled. Waited for the activities bus. Wanted to peg at least 10 people. I was put into the most awquard situation EVER. Im antisocial. I hate the activities bus. ::argh::

All you need is love...heh, what a lie, all you need is a cream filled doughnut, and a computer. Love is unfaithful and reversible...love is hate turned upside down. Love is misery, sweet, bitter misery.

This book is one of Oscar Wilde's best works, in fact..its his only book. But its by far a great story. 
Im just so bored, and its so pretty out, but I dont want to leave the house.
The birds are singing, and there is a pretty little butterfly in my backyard, and I wish I could feel happy...
I think I might be bipolar, that would suck so bad...no no no please no.

You are one big mess of misunderstood emotions.<br>Unfortunatelly you lost all of your friends<br>once you started wearing only black, Gap<br>sweaters and fake glasses. The good news is<br>that you now have a whole new ring of anti-<br>social, well-dressed friends. You sure got a<br>way with style, and the music you listen to is<br>enough to make even the hardest of people break<br>down in tears. Times used to be tough, but<br>these days life is pretty good for an emo kid.<br>With your short black hair and morbid poetry<br>you are the envy of every depressed, suicide<br>attempting, starbucks drinking mallgoer in your<br>town.

"event","Its kinda sad, how people who post anonymously and have absolutely nothing productive to say continue to act like 2 year olds.
They talk about maturity like if there was a mature bone in their bodies. I offered a happy word to someone, I DIDNT get in their problem, choose sides, tell her to do anything...I just gave an honest opinion about life in general. No one has the right to tell me anything about that...especially not someone that cant even sign their names.
I dont even get why im being <b>warned</b> since I only talk to Kelly online, and Ive met her only once...?
I dont get people nowadays...:\

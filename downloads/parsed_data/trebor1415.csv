"event","I just got an e-mail that Epinions.com is closing up shop. I&#39;ve been on that site since 2000 and it was the first writing for the web I ever did for money.

I just thought I&#39;d repost the goodbye post I made over at the Epinions.com forum, as much for myself for when that forum goes down as anything.


<b>My Epinions.com story - and Goodbye</b><p>Although I&#39;ve been expecting Epinions to close up shop for awhile now, I was still surprised and saddened by the announcement.

I&#39;ve had some success here and got to know some good people. I thought I&#39;d review some highlights of my Epinions experience.

I joined on June 12, 2000 and wrote 91 reviews total. I was never very prolific: I wrote five reviews in 2000, and 1 each in 2001, 2003, and 2004 (I skipped 2002 entirely).

I got back in 2008 during a &quot;10 for 10&quot; promotion. I wrote 39 in 2008, 34 in 2009, and 10 in 2010, and none since then.

I was fortunate enough that my firearms gear and ammo reviews really took off in 2009 and I was top rated, site wide, for 11 months that year.

I had a total of 426,549 visits (3,285 member) which got me to #7 in Sports and Outdoors and #252 overall. I&#39;m bummed I didn&#39;t crack that &quot;Top 250&quot; level.

My most successful review brought in $126.15 and my worst brought in 5 cents.

My favorite review was of my old Minolta X370 35mm SLR camera that I wrote in 2000. It was a very personal review of something very dear to me. Amazingly, it&#39;s still getting hits and bringing in about 25 cents a month even now!

(My second favorite is a book review of &quot;The Cuckoo&#39;s Egg&quot; by Clifford Stoll. One of my favorite books and another very personal review. It&#39;s also the first time I &quot;let loose&quot; a bit and tried some humor in my writing).

I&#39;ve had reviews pay widely within those ranges. If you do a simple average of &quot;money earned/# of reviews&quot; it comes out to about $26 per review. Well worth the effort overall. (And yes, if you wanna do the math, you&#39;ll know my total earnings. Big deal).

Since I haven&#39;t written since 2010 I&#39;ve just been grateful for whatever IS I&#39;ve earned since I stopped writing. I&#39;ve always been amazed that they continued to pay after I stopped contributing to the site.

Epinions definitely helped my writing career. My Epinions success in 2009 helped me get a title (column) at Examiner.com in Nov. 2009.

In addition to helping me get the Examiner column, writing about firearms accessories and ammo helped me develop the writing skills I now use for print magazines.

While the Examiner column (I have 3 now) isn&#39;t the most financial lucrative thing out there, I have had some success with it.

More importantly, I was able to use an Examiner article I&#39;d already written to break into a brand new firearms magazine a year ago by agreeing to let them reprint it for free in their first &quot;promo&quot; issue.

That led to an ongoing relationship and I&#39;m now contracted to write one article a month for them. I&#39;ve had 12 articles published with them so far and have placed two other articles in two other firearms magazines based on those clips.

So, indirectly, Epinions played a role in all that.

As to people, I&#39;ve enjoyed the people I met here. I&#39;ve exchanged comments and e-mails with a few of you and there are a few I need to contact to get your e-mail to stay in touch.

That&#39;s my Epinions story. What&#39;s yours?</p>"

"event","<p>A few years ago I had a pretty surreal experience. My wife and I were visiting D.C. and we stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Now, you have to understand that I don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; anyone on the wall. My Uncle Tom spent &#39;67 to &#39;68 as an Army Combat Engineer &quot;in country,&quot; and my Dad was in the Navy at the same time, but they both came home safe. (As did my Grandpa Earl Reed, from WWII).<br /><br />But, I&#39;ve always been a military history buff, and I&#39;ve&nbsp;read a lot about Vietnam, so I wanted to see the Wall. Since I didn&#39;t have any particular name to to look for, I just more or less randomly looked at particular names as I walked the length of the memorial.<br /><br />When I got to the panel for 1967 I saw my own name there (with a different middle initial). &quot;Robert W Reed.&quot; I had one of the Park Service guides look up his info in the book they had there and that&#39;s when things got really weird.<br /><br />Robert W Reed was a Marine Killed in Action on April 5, 1967. That&#39;s the day I was born. Not just my birthday, but the actual day.<br /><br />Ever since then I&#39;ve been a bit haunted by this stranger that shared my name and who died serving his country on the day I was born. Every now and then I&#39;ve tried to find more about him and finally, yesterday, I found new info posted about him on the web. I also found part of a newspaper article about his death and contacted that newspaper&#39;s librarian who is sending me their complete clipping file on him.<br /><br />The story I&#39;ve discovered is that USMC Captain Robert W. Reed was Company Commander, Charlie Company, 1st Battillion. 9th Marines. On April 5, 1967 he led his company on a sweep of Ap Dong Ho following an enemy ambush of a Marine Motor Supply Unit nearby.<br /><br />The Charlie Company lead platoon, with Captain Reed&#39;s command group along, was 30 meters from the village when they were taken under heavy small arms fire from enemy troops in concealed positions. Captain Reed was killed in the first exchange of fire and part of the lead platoon position was overrun. He was later posthumously promoted to Major and awarded the Bronze Star (although I do not know if it was for this action or an earlier action).<br /><br />The &quot;Virtual Wall&quot; had the following information posted on this incident:<br /><br />The 3rd Motor Transport Battalion&#39;s Command Chronology for April 1967 contains the following entry:<br />&quot;5 Apr - Two Otters received hostile fire while operating in support of Operation &#39;Big Horn&#39;. This action resulted in one Otter disabled. Pfc R. J. FITCH received enemy gunshot wounds which penetrated his chest resulting in his death. LCpl L. H. UNDERWOOD and Pfc G. R. POBANZ received injuries. Pfc FITCH was manning the Otter&#39;s .50 caliber machine gun at the time.&quot;<br /><br />This incident occurred at 1730 when the two M-76 Otters and their security force were ambushed while on a resupply run in support of Delta Company, 1/9 Marines, position. The Otters had run into a &quot;U&quot;-shaped ambush southeast of the hamlet of Ap Dong Ho (1) and were in immediate trouble with one Marine killed and eight wounded. Two platoons, one each from Charlie and Delta 1/9, were dispatched to assist the 3rd MT Bn Marines. The Charlie 1/9 platoon arrived at 1815 and found that the ambushers had withdrawn. Helo medevac was called in for the 3rd MT casualties, and it was decided that a sweep of Ap Dong Ho was appropriate in order to ensure there was no threat to the helicopters. The Delta 1/9 platoon, approaching from the northwest, was to move on the hamlet from that direction while the bulk of Charlie 1/9 would sweep from the southeast. The sweep began at 1930, but the Delta 1/9 platoon was stopped almost at once by heavy fire from the hamlet and entered into a two hour firefight before being ordered to break contact at 2130.<br /><br />Charlie 1/9 approached to within 30 meters of the hamlet before drawing fire, but when it came it was devastating. By misfortune, an illumination flare had just been dropped - but rather than illuminating the enemy in the hamlet it illuminated the Marines moving across the open ground bordering the hamlet.<br /><br />The Charlie 1/9 Company Commander, Captain R. W. Reed, was killed in the first exchange of fires, and the enemy took advantage of their &quot;first kill&quot; to envelop part of the lead platoon&#39;s skirmish line. They then broke contact and withdrew to the north before the Charlie 1/9 reserve platoon could engage them.<br /><br />The enemy force, estimated to be of company size, left 17 bodies in and around Ap Dong Ho. Blood and drag trails indicated that another 40 to 50 VC had been killed and their bodies carried with the withdrawing VC force. The Delta 1/9 platoon had 2 killed and 24 wounded in the engagement; Charlie 1/9 had 15 killed and 20 wounded. Pfc Fitch from 3rd MT had been killed in the initial ambush, and two men from Charlie 1/9&#39;s artillery forward observer team were killed in the Charlie 1/9 engagement. The dead were<br /><br />H&amp;S Co, 3rd Motor Trans Bn, 3rd Mardiv, 3rd MAF<br />Pfc Ronald J. Fitch, St Johns, MI<br /><br /><br />D Btry, 3rd Bn, 12th Marines (Arty F/O team w/ C/1/9)<br />SSgt Leland D. Zahn, Harris, IA (Silver Star)<br />LCpl Harry E.

This was Joel's first book about a group a college students who get transported from the &quot;real world&quot; into a fantasy world while playing a game based on D&amp;D. The idea was well executed and the characters were interesting, believable, and likeable. It quickly became one of my favorite novels. <br /><br />I never met Joel, but did correspond with him via e-mail several times over the years. I was a member on the Slovotskys-Laws fan site and enjoyed talking about his work with the other fans their.&nbsp;Joel and Felicia would occassionally post and I enjoyed the interaction. I was never able to attend any of the &quot;SlotCon's&quot; where the site members got to met Joel, and now I really regret that.<br /><br />Joel was also a firearms instructor and RKBA&nbsp;activist. He trained many people to allow them to get their Minnesotta carry permit. He also literally wrote the book on concealed carry in Minnesotta. <br /><br />To me though, I will always think of him as the author of some of my favorite books. I recently re-read &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; and was looking for my copy of the second novel of the series to read through them again. I always enjoy them, but it will be more bittersweet this time.<br /><br />My condelences to Felicia, Judy, and Rachel, and to all his friends. <br /><br />Here is a link to Joel's site where Felicia made the announcement.<br /><br /><a href=""http://freejoel.ellegon.com/2011/06/03/joel-rosenberg-husband-father-mensch/"">Joel Rosenberg</a></p><br />"

At first they looked alike, but Merlin grew larger than his sister. <br /><br />When&nbsp;I moved in Merlin saw me as an interloper.&nbsp;He was jealous that I was taking some of Marie's attention. He'd let me know who was in charge by randomly coming up to me when I was on the floor watching TV to bite my hand. He wouldn't break the skin, but wanted to express dominance. We later reached an understanding and got along better.<br /><br />When Marie got home from work Merlin would great her at the door. He'd sit with her on her lap or on the couch next to her while she read or watched TV. He didn't talk as much as his sister, but would give us each little &quot;Mrmhps&quot; as greetings. We also called him &quot;Merfin&quot; for the sound he'd make.<br /><br />Merlin loved to play with the birdie-on-a-stick.&nbsp;We'd take turns casting the birdie in front of each cat. Merlin would do back flips and leap in the air to catch the birdie. He also loved his little blue foam ball. One time I saw the ball was across the room and said,&nbsp;&quot;Merlin, get the ball.&quot;&nbsp;He promptly walked over, retrieved the ball in his teeth, and brought it to me. He must have decided not to set a precedent that he'd take commands though, as he never did it again.&nbsp;Either that or he didn't want us to know he understood English.<br /><br />He also loved his little yellow stuffed fishie. We'd put catnap on it and he'd roll around with it.&nbsp;Even without the catnap he'd often hold it or sleep with it. <br /><br />Merlin had his quirks:&nbsp;We used to keep Marie's bike in our bedroom and Merlin loved to lick the spokes.&nbsp;We never figured out why, as the bike hadn't been outside in years, and there should have been nothing on the spokes to interest a cat. Whenever there was a thunderstorm he'd get amorous and attack Ford.&nbsp;They were both fixed and Ford wasn't really receptive, so she'd smack him. We don't know what it was about thunderstorms that set him off. A year or so ago he started taking showers.&nbsp;He'd go into the shower stall and ask us to turn on the water.&nbsp;He'd then stand under the water, lick a little from the floor, and usually plop down on the tile. When we'd turn off the water he'd sit there for a minute or two, then leave and groom his wet fur back into shape.<br /><br />Merlin loved to eat. He was an omnivore cat.&nbsp;He especially loved bread products. We had to keep our bread and hamburger buns in the only &quot;Merlin free zone&quot; on top of the file cabinet as he'd jump on the kitchen counter to nibble through the plastic to get the tasty bread.&nbsp;He also loved chocolate chip cookies. He'd jump on the table, steal a cookie in his mouth, and then jump down to eat it in solitude. He also tried apples and potatoes. We saw him knock a potato off the counter, pounce on it when it started to roll, and then take a big bite to kill his &quot;prey.&quot;<br /><br />He was a large cat. We put him on many diets, with mixed success. At his heaviest he was 20 pounds, but was thinner the last few years. When he wanted breakfast he'd come in the bedroom and whack the clock with his paw until we woke up or he knocked it off the table.<br /><br />Merlin's mottos were, &quot;Be adventurous. Try new things. Enjoy your food.&quot; <br /><br />Merlin was fairly healthy most of his life.&nbsp;He did have allergies, and had a problem with lip ulcers for a while, but those were both successfully treated. He developed mega colon a few years ago, but was on daily meds that kept it under control.&nbsp;Surprisingly, considering how much he ate, he never developed diabetes. <br /><br />We took Merlin in for a checkup about a month ago. His kidney values were a little high, but not alarmingly so. The vet said we'd want to monitor them, and, in the meantime, see if he could lose a little weight. When Ford died a week or so later Merlin's appetite dropped off.&nbsp;We thought he was mourning.&nbsp;He may have been, but it may have also been a sign of the kidney disease.<br />&nbsp;<br />He was very weak on Wednesday and we took him to the emergency vet Wednesday night. He had severe kidney disease and one kidney was completely non-functional. Unfortunately, he also had cardiac problems and, as we learned with Ford, you can't usually treat both kidney disease and heart disease in cats at the same time.&nbsp; We took him home and had almost 24 hours with him.&nbsp;We cuddled him and he purred and snuggled us.&nbsp;When he started having trouble breathing we took him to the vet and let him go. He was comfortable and calm at the end, which is all we could ask.<br /><br />We miss them both terribly. </span><br />Merlin<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/IMG_2853.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/IMG_2759.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/OctandNov20101080.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/CopyofIMG_2737.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/OctandNov20101166.jpg"" /></span>"

"event","<p>We lost Marie's special little Ford cat today.<br /><br />Ford joined our life as a little kitten. When we went to a friend's house to pick two kittens Ford crawled up Marie's arm, nuzzled her ear and purred. &quot;Your mine, take me home now.&quot; We took her, and her brother Merlin (my choice), to live with us.<br /><br />When I saw what kitten Marie picked I said, &quot;You picked the two identical gray cats. How will we tell them apart?&quot;&nbsp;Most of the time it was easy: Merlin quickly grew to be bigger than Ford.&nbsp;And, where Merlin was a bit of a grouch, Ford was always a sweetheart.<br /><br />Ford bonded to Marie intently.&nbsp;She'd sit in Marie's lap for hours, sleep in her arms at night, and know that all was right in the world if Momma Cat was there. Earlier this year&nbsp;Ford taught Marie how to feed her properly. Ford was on a special diet so we fed her in the bedroom and kept her food on the dresser. One time Marie was asleep until Ford poked her gently on the&nbsp;forehead with her paw. When Marie woke up, Ford looked at Marie, looked over at the dresser where her food was, and then looked back at Marie.&nbsp;She repeated this until Marie figured it out.<br /><br />Ford was named for a character in Hitchhiker's because she loved to cuddle up in towels. The girls at the vet's office thought Ford was&nbsp;a weird name for a girl cat and took to calling her &quot;Miss Ford.&quot; We also called her that, and just &quot;Little girl&quot;. <br /><br />Ford loved to play with her feathers-on-a-string cat toy. Once she'd caught the &quot;birdie&quot; she'd grab it in her teeth and pull away until we let go of the stick.&nbsp;She'd then take her prize into the other room and force us to retrieve it to play some more.<br /><br />Ford had a happy life with us for over 17 years. She was healthy until a year and a half ago when she developed Kidney disease.&nbsp;She survived the first crisis and we managed the disease OK until she also developed anemia. She'd still been doing OK until she had another crisis right before this last Christmas. <br /><br />She rebounded a bit, and we gained another month with her. She had a good day with us yesterday, one of the best of the last month. She sat in Marie's arms for hours on the couch, which she hadn't done recently. She then took a bad turn over night and we took her to the vet in the morning. The fluids used to treat her Kidney disease led to congestive heart failure. It wasn't treatable so we had to let her go on without us this afternoon. It was the hardest thing we've ever had to do.<br /><br />We both miss her terribly.&nbsp;Merlin knows something is wrong, but we're not sure if he know's exactly what yet.<br /><br />She had a good life with us and we're glad she shared her life with us.</p><p>Ford cat<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/Feb2010002.jpg"" /></p>Ford and Merlin<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/April2010smallcamera013.jpg"" /><br />"

As a firearms instructor most of the shooting products I review I use on a regular basis. I've learned what works and what doesn't and I share that info in my reviews. I'm also a recent first-time homeowner so as I discover what I need to know to maintain and upgrade my home I'm reviewing those products as well. My wife and I both are avid readers and often suggest books to each other. The books I review here are the ones I'd recommend to a friend *or* books so horridly bad that they should be avoided at all costs. My tastes run towards military history, archeology and anthropology, SF/fantasy, mysteries and thrillers. In the past I've been a pizza cook and waiter, emergency room clerk, radio reporter and announcer, newspaper reporter, and magazine staff writer. I love knowing how things *really* work and learning behind-the-scenes info.

If you want to check out my reviews I'm at:  http://www1.epinions.com/user-trebor1415

I'm currently the #1 most read reviewer for 2009, so I must either be doing something right, or just be really lucky."

"event","I know it's traditional to post pretty much only positive wrap ups, but for us this year' Penguicon was really a mixed bag.

The good: 

The people:  Marie reconnected with an old friend she happened to bump into in the registration line. I got to hang out with some people I only see at cons or know on-line. I had a nice conversation with Mike Williamston in the dealer's room and enjoyed talking to Elizabeth Bear after one of her panels. I read her LJ, but we aren't ""real life"" friends, so it was nice to get a better sense of what she's like in the real world (She's great, btw).

The panels: We really enjoyed all the writing panels we attended. As I told EB, ""You give good panel,"" as do the rest of the ""pro"" authors and most of the self published authors. Some standout panels for us included the self publishing panel, the Vampires and Werewolves panel (""Tramp stamp fantasy"" FTW), and the ""How to kill yor character"" panel (for me anyway. Marie was getting squished out as she tried to eat her Brazilian beef). There were some other good to great panels as well, but my mind has blanked out on them at the moment.

Now the bad:

The hotel - We both thought there were some serious problems with the suitability of the hotel as a con venue.

The biggest problem was the extremely small rooms used for much of the programing. The ""Poolside"" rooms were especially bad. There were several panels we wanted to attend that filled up right away that would have still had space if held in larger rooms like what have been used at other hotels in the past.

This was especially bad for the music track. That's normally one of our favorite things, but this year we managed only to sit through the Rob Balder concert before giving up on the music completely. The room was just too small to be comfortable with performers and a sound system. That was a big disapointment to us as the music track is usually one of our favorite activities.

The con suite: I know we're probably in the minority in this, but we actually prefer the old ""con suite as a suite"" concept to the ""hotel restaurant takeover"" concept. With the con suite being so very centrally located, it got more traffic, and was almost always over-crowded. As a result it was sometimes very difficult to find a place to sit and it seems like they were always out of food.

The Brazillian Beef: I went back and forth about mentioning this, because I know how hard the people running this worked. In the end though, I gotta say, it didn't work out well. From what I understand, not having the second grill is what caused the problem. From the point of view of those standing in line though, what we found frustrating was the lack of communication about what was going on. Marie waited for an hour and 40 minutes (a relatively short wait, btw) and I don't think she ever got a real update on the status the whole time. To make matters worse, after all the build up, when Marie got her beef it was overcooked and bordering on WAAY overcooked.


Yeah, I know, ""A con is what you make of it"" and we had a pretty decent con overall. It just wasn't our ""Best Penguicon Ever"" and largely because of the problems with the hotel as a venue. (Don't even get me started on the elevators...)"

"event","The ER finale was one of the best series enders I've seen and a pretty darn good episode of the show in general.

I think one of the reasons it worked is that the creators let the audience say ""Goodbye"" to the characters without resorting to the cliche of having the hospital close or having everyone die. (Or finding out it was all in an autistic boy's head). Instead we see that life at County General will continue, even if we aren't able to see it.

I just hope they avoid the temptation for the ""After ER"" sequal with Jerry, and Chuney, and one of the med students living together in an apartment and having wacky adventures..."

"event","I have to say the finale of ""Life on Mars"" did fit with everything they did all season.

That doesn't mean I have to like it though. 

I hate when shows get rushed finales due to cancellation. Sometimes it's better if they just end without trying to wrap everything up in a shortened season or in a single episode.

And, yes, I'm looking at you, ""Forever Knight"" as well."

"event","I FINALLY got a website put up for my firearms instructor business. I've only had the domain for, what, two years or so now?

I found my domain host's ""build a site"" page and was able to find a template that worked for me and figure it out without too much pain. It's VERY simple, and I only get one page hosted as part of the domain name deal, but it'll work for now. I mean, having ANYTHING up is better then nothing.

http://www.swatacademy.com/

Check it out and report back if you see any problems or typos. I especially want to make sure it works with non-IE browsers, so if you run Firefox or something, please take a look.

I'll probably totally redo it after I buy some hosting space and talk to the guy who offered to help in exchange for a class awhile back, but this will do for now.

Oh, and anyone know how I set up a @swatacademy.com e-mail for myself? I'ms sure that's something I get with the domain, but I don't know how to set it up or forward it to my regular e-mail. 

I'll poke around the domain registration site later (register.com) but if anyone can help me, that would be appreciated."

This next book is perfect for any military history buff on your list. Donald R. Burgett was a paratrooper with the 101st Airborne who jumped on D-Day and in Operation Market Garden. I think his books are some of the best personal narratives to come out of WWII.

Here are a few stocking stuffers for any shooter on your list.

Bore Snakes are great for the range bag for a quick clean before leaving the range.

Snap Caps let you dry fire without damaging your firearm. These are the best I've found.

"event","My Grandfather died in December and we finally were able to go through his house and sort through everything. He was a junk dealer (among other things) and never threw out *anything.*

He lived in the same house all his life. It's a Michigan farmhouse built in 1906. His Grandmother and mother lived with him there until they each passed away years ago. After my Grandmother passed away around 1975 the upstairs of the old farmhouse were pretty much sealed off. Before now I think I'd only been up there two or three times in 20 years. His mother's room was pretty much as she left it when she went to live in a nursing home 30 years ago.

We think this was his Mother's or possibly his Grandmother's sewing Machine. It's a Singer Vibrating Shuttle 2 manufactured in 1889. When we found it it was still threaded and a test scrap was still on the table. It's a foot treadle machine with cast iron workings.

We brought it home and cleaned it gently with Murphy's Oil soap. Other then that, we're going to leave it pretty much as is. The belt is broken, but there is a spare in one of the drawers. I'm sure if we put it on the machine would make a stitch. We may do that some day.

Here's the machine as we found it in the upstairs hallway.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/?action=view&current=Singerinsitu1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/Singerinsitu1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Singer in situ 1""></a>

I just opened the lid and snapped a quick pic. I can only guess when the last time was this machine was touched and who used it last.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/?action=view&current=SingerInsitu2.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/SingerInsitu2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Singer in situ 2""></a>

We took it home and gave it a very gentle cleaning with Murphy's Oil Soap. There are two pieces of veneer broken off the middle drawer. That's the only real damage, other then normal wear and tear. I've started a hunt for a replacement drawer to swap out, just for appearances sake.

The lid is known as a ""Coffin top"" lid, for obvious reasons.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/?action=view&current=Singerwcabinetresized.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/Singerwcabinetresized.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Singer w cabinet""></a>

Here it is with the lid removed. Notice the broken belt hanging down. Once a get a set of reproduction instructions I'll probably replace the belt with the spare in the drawer.

The accessories come in a wooden puzzle box that folds out. Here's the box closed.

And here's the box open. I don't sew so what these are and what they do is a mystery to me. They might as well be artifacts from an ancient civilization as far as I know.

These are other bobbins and parts. Notice that one of the bobbins is still in the wrap.

Here's the last of the parts and accessories. There were also some scissors and needles and such in one of the drawers that I didn't take a picture of. I never opened the small black box so I don't know what's in it.

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/?action=view&current=Singerpartsresized.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v494/Trebor1415/Singerpartsresized.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Singer parts""></a>

This Drug Store box held needles and thread. Note the prescription date of 3/12/1904!

I spent several hours researching the machine on-line before I positively identified it as a Vibrating Shuttle 2. I told my wife my conclusions and she asked why I didn't just look on the instruction manual in the middle drawer? D'uh! There was an instruction manual? 

Here it is. It's too delicate to unfold fully and use. There are reproduction manuals available and I plan to buy one of those to go with the machine.

I hope you've enjoyed this time capsule into the past. I felt like an archaeologist unearthing these artifacts and researching them."

"event","Well, we bought a house, our first.

Our offer was accepted yesterday. The inspection is today. Closing should be in about three weeks.

This was the time to buy. We got more home then we could have otherwise afforded. 

It's a ranch with 1980 square feet, three bedrooms, an office, a big kitchen, living room, family room, dining room, and an ""extra"" room we'll use as an art studio/photo studio. It also has an above-ground pool and a two car garage. It's on a slab, so there's no basement, but no loss. There is an attic above the garage with some decent storage space.

This was actually the third or fourth house we looked at. We found it by picking a starting point in the area where we wanted to live and driving in a grid pattern through all the neighborhoods. We saw *a lot* of houses for sale. When we saw one we'd take pictures of the house and the sign and call the realtor for info. 

We looked at about four or five houses later after we found a realtor to help us with the search. We just kept comparing everything to ""the big house"" and realized that there was nothing else we would find in our price range that was as good. We wanted lots of room, and a garage, and privacy. The house has a nice wooded lot that blocks the view of the neighbors. 

We finally just gave up on looking and made a bid. A little haggling later, and viola, a house!

Wish us luck getting moved in. This may be the last move we ever make."

I've never met him and never even talked to him on the phone. He was just one of my favorite people on that forum and I always enjoyed reading his posts and sometimes exchanging PM's with him.

I can't believe I'm feeling the loss of someone I never actually met so much. I've had other ""on-line friends"" who have died, but this is really bothering me. And, of course, it sounds so stupid and petty when I explain it to someone. His family and real friends are really the ones who are suffering the loss. I'm just a tangential person out on the fringes of his life.

Sometimes this whole internet thing sucks. What's the point of making friends on-line, if you are never going to meet them in real life, and then feel bad when something happens to them?"

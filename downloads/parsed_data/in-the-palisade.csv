"event","here is my list of dos and donts when visiting my mall:

PARKING LOT:
DO park in a timely and orderly manner.
DONT wait for someone to walk to their car, get in their car, turn on their ipod, put on their make up and then back out when other cars are behind you.
DO give pedestrians the right of way.
DONT speed past them.

ESCALATOR:
DO choose one method and stick with it: the walk or the stand.
DO pick one side to stand on if you wish to stand.
DONT stand in the middle of the escalator.
DONT get pissy when i clank down the stairs as loud as i can hoping you will move and not force me to say excuse me.
DONT hold both sides of the rail while ridding down the escalator.
DONT ignore me when i say excuse me trying to pass you.

MALL WALKING:
DO walk around the mall.
DO pay attention to where you are going, some people have glass doors.
DONT form a chain of snails, some people do walk faster than you.
DONT walk into glass doors! it hurts and makes you look like a moron.
DONT ask us apple related questions when we walk around the mall in our apple shirts. 

VISITING STORES:
DO brose products.
DO try products.
DONT loiter in any store for more than 15 minutes with no intent to buy anything.
DONT come to a store with music and assume that everyone likes your music, i will tell you it is bad and ask you to turn it down.
DONT squeal when you see friends who you havent seen since school eariler.
DONT yell at your children in front of us.
DONT ignore us, a simple fine thank you or even a smile is better than nothing when we ask how you are doing.
DONT drop your children off at our store thinking we can entertain them. 
also DONT think that if you have procare that means we will babysit your children. We have jobs to do and they do not hire us based on a ""friendly with children"" scale.

BUYING AT STORES:
DO buy out items.
DO tell your friends about how friendly and effecient we are.
DONT come in after we are closed and take forever to buy something.
DONT dismiss sales people and before they can walk two feet ask them for help."

"event","so one of my coworkers. brian. has a blog. it may quite possibly be one of my favorite blogs ever.
http://texasbrian.blogspot.com/
here is an excerp from his blog, not for the week <lj-cut text=""hearted""> hearted


The World According To Me
I'm tired. SO tired.

Tired of outdated rules and regulations, of selectively enforced morality, of the direction this country is headed in under its current ""leadership,"" if you can call it that.

With that said, I propose a new set of rules that would make for a more tolerable society -- at least for me.

1. GET OUT OF MY WAY.
If you happen to be sharing the roadway with me, then I expect you to be courteous. In my book, that means, very simply, getting out of my way. Your 1982 lime green Daewoo car spewing smoke out of the back while you're doing 40 mph on an interstate is not only a danger, but it pisses me off. Your 40 is blocking my 80. Get the hell out of the left lane! It's for passing only. And don't pull that ""speed limit"" crap on me. Unless you're a cop, take off your Wal-Mart plastic police badge and quit ""enforcing"" the law. If you ARE a cop, then ticketing me doesn't deter me; an empty car makes me slow down. Put decoy cars out if you want, but go do some real work like, I don't know, stopping murders and things like that. Let me have my 70 in a 55.

2. IF YOU USE MYSPACE.COM, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY A LOSER.
Get a life.

3. DO NOT BE RUDE IN PUBLIC.
I don't care if it's the Gas-N-Gulp around the corner, the mall, your kid's school or a coffee shop -- NEVER, EVER be an ass in public. I don't care if you're having the worst day of your life
or you want a refund thisverydamnedminute. Being an ass in public is never accetpable. If you do it as a restauarant, you deserve whatever the cooks do to your food afterward. If you bitch at a retail store, fucking shop online next time. If you can't be decent to people in public, you don't deserve to be there.

4. DRESS FOR YOUR SIZE. AND COVER IT UP.
Guys: I'm so fucking sick of seeing your boxers randomly. I don't know you that well. Girls, if I know what kind of thong you have on or if your belly button is pierced, then something is wrong. I don't want to see that shit! COVER IT UP! Clothes are supposed to COVER up your nasty ass nakedness (or just your nasty ass). No more cheeks hanging out in public, oceans of cleavage threatenening to swalllow up innocent bystanders, no more underage lovehandles overflowing low-rise jeans like a muffin outgrowing its pan. Jesus.

5. VOTE DEMOCRATIC.
Otherwise, you automatically become a goatfucker. Unless you're an arrogant multimillionaire soulless asshole, you have NO BUSINESS voting Republican. I don't care if you're the most holy-roller-NASCAR-loving-Natty-Light-drinkin redneck, the GOP doesn't give a fuck about anyone that isn't rich. They just sell you things like abortion, guns, and gay rights issues to get your vote. When's the last time they did anything for YOU? They're too busy giving themselves raises, giving their rich buddies tax cuts and sending kids off to die for oil.

6. GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING SUV'S.
OK, soccer moms. You're not driving a CAR. I don't care how it feels. It's a sports utility vehicle. It it closer to tank than car, and chances are you are doing a shitty job of ""driving it,"" clipping curbs of innocent shopping centers all over suburbia and driving across lanes as if the white lines were just mere suggestions. Go get a nice, safe Volvo. And quit having so many fucking kids. Which brings me to my next point...

7. QUIT HAVING SO MANY FUCKING KIDS.
As if the line at the DMV isn't long enough. Schools are bursting at the seams. Whole countries are overpopulated, cities are filled with traffic, orphanages all over are packed, and you feel necessary to add another person to the planet. Thanks. And no, your baby isn't cute. All babies look alike. And baby showers -- WTF? People are supposed to give you gifts because you know how to fuck? Next they'll be giving you gifts because you know how to pee.

which then leads to a number 8 from a previous post:

The mall is NOT your babysitter

Every weekend, you'll find packs of kids as young as 12 or so, in groups, being jerks, yelling, cussing, making out, and just being annoying in general. I find it appalling that any sane parent would simply drop their kids off like that, like the mall is some sort of holding pen. What's worse, is that there is a real danger even to those ""good kids"" -- unaccompanied youngsters could get kidnapped, etc.I think any parent who drops a kid off at the mall is just an idiot. You bad parents: you know who you are. </lj-cut>, right winger, suv driving mothers, mall rat, bitch, or myspacer.

thats pretty much sums up how i feel.
but now i am off to sleep to wake up tomorrow. 
to take a test, then a lecture, then work:
thursday: 1-8
friday: 12-5 (at least)
saturday: 12-9
sunday: 9-7
monday: 2-8

then tuesday, wed, thursday class.
tuesday is my doll critique. yeah right, when am i going to find time to shoot?"

and ill be in the woodlands, then houston, then san antonio, back to the woodlands, then home.
what a crazy week and a few days it will be. 
literally living out of my car.

i threw up a few times this morning.
not like i ad anything to throw up becuas ei hadnt eaten for over 12 hours.
but my body found something that it didnt like.
so taht sucked.
the first time i had to run into the bathroom and mike came in and was like are you ok?
inbetween throwing up all i could think to do was apologize for not closing the door.
he just wanted to make sure i was ok though.

work tomorrow then not again till next friday - sunday.

and now im off to the woodlands.
i hope i start feeling better soon.
hopefully before tomorrow.

"event","preface: i had a cold sore the other week and it was quite horid, none the less, i went to work and sucked it up, being totally self conscious the entire time. durring the time a few people at my work were laughing and telling me that i had herpes and whatnot. we are oh so mature at the apple store.

so when im getting ready to leave work (today)... and i get to my locker and there is a newpaper cut out of something all about herpes on my locker, then i open my locker and there is more stuff in it. imeadiatly i knew exatly who did it... the person who gave me the most greif about it. so i go and talk to my manager, who then sends out this email:

There was a news paper clipping that stated some improper information on a locker in the back.  One of the values of Apple is to be able to work in an environment that is free from harassment.  Do not create an unsafe or hostile work environment.  This will not be tolerated.  Consider this a verbal warning for all.

i got an apology from not the person i though, but from the person who i would have least expected who did it with him.
how terably hurt i was.
he still has not apologized to me.
that may be because when i left the store, i told him that if he got aids, i would not feel bad for him.
never saying i wanted him to die, but somehwat implying that i would not mind him suffering.
whatever, he is a douche... who totally used to be like my best work buddy.

so now im just a little sad.
but feeling kinda good that i stood up for myself.
and johnny... 
(he also slamed the fire door on johnnys hand, had i not found that out i probably wouldnt have gotten so upset)
so peace, im out"

so yesterday after class i was able to get my imac working. 
just needed to restart a bunch of stuff and yeah.
but then. 
between the time of me going to my getting it fixed and me getting back from my night class...
disaster struck.
omg, could anything go my way?
lemonade was spilled in my keyboard.
no it wasnt done by me.
when my keyboard was starting to fail i called tech support.
they told me to take the batteris out and when i did, lemonade spilled all over me.
i put the tech support guy on hold while i had a slight freak out, then got back on the phone and told him the situation.
after hanging up i threw my temper tantrum in the laundry room.
office depot had nothing that would work with my comp, but i want an apple keyboard anyway.
everything matches.
not having a keyboard is the saddest thing ever.
well not sadder than my powerbook not working, but alas.
i will get a new one today.
last night since everyone thought i was so mad at sean i offered to sleep on the couch.
worst idea ever by the way.
way me make a pissy girl even more pissed.
on the list of whats going on:
apple store: 
wireless keyboard
firewire 400 to firewire 400 (:( my imac doesnt have a 800 port)
get my harddrive replaced and old one zapped.
try and get off this weekend.
frys:
return hard drive

the good things from yesterday:
got my fetish project approved for photo!
got together with kyla for our photo project. (you can see some of my prints on facebook under ""the fox"" album.)
had a nice diner with johnny. (not free of text messaging or calls though.)
and i think my camera will be shipping soon."

i found out last week that my logic board is faulty as well.
now this may not be something bad if i had registered my apple care.
so i sat on the phone with apple this morning trying to fix my apple care situation and they were so nice and helpfull.
i was able to get it registered mearly over the phone.
so now my computer is protected. 
(in the way that she is now using a condom)
so all that needs to happen now is i need to take it to the store, and have them fix it for me as if i were a real customer.
insted of before when they were just being great little pals. 
however i dont know how long i could be without it becuase of the whole parts situation.
alas, i hope to get her fixed.
i am still thinking i will get a desktop. 
i think that now is the right time and i get a somewhat sweet deal.
then in the future save up for aperture.
But now im just chilling here, watching house.
Waiting till pre noon so i can drive to apple.

you lost what was real and important.

my roomates. kate, bea, me, jackie.

now im in english. 
although class is over.
we are just hanging around.
i was printing out some sources all about sex trafficking.
thats what im writting my final paper about.
sweet deal.

and i have to write another paper about early fashion photography and possibly how it morphed into pornography.
yay.
thats for my history of photo class.

for my photo comp class i need to take a few more pictures.
and photoshop the ones i have.
the good news is i will be at my gfathers for turkey day and i can print there.
even though i am in the second group to present.
so if i need to i can redo a little.
i also need to get mat boards.
now i am starting to sound like katie.

i ahd a dream last night that i had a kid.
he was like real young but could talk.
he lived with my mom so i could do my school work and everything.
so one day i asked him if he knew who i was and he said no.
so i told him i was his mom. 
then i asked him what he called my mom.
he said mama... and i started to cry.

i got an 87 on my paper about the pullout.
and a 92 on my paper about gay rights.
which included my favorite paragraph:
	
Less than one year after my gay brother died of complications due to pneumonia, my parents got divorced. I was not a nieve child, I knew that my brother was gay. I knew that he had a partner. I also knew that his partner was able to stand by his side until the day he died, even knowing that he had HIV/AIDS, one of the scariest epidemics to first hit the gay community. I learned more from my brother about love. Michael McManus of Marriage Savers writes, ""Divorce is a far more grievous blow to marriage than today's challenge by gays."" My brother and his partner showed me that even through the worst circumstances, you can still love. My parents showed me the opposite; when the going gets tough, get out.

anyway. 
life must go on.
house season one dvd is what i was thankfull for last night.
i trully am in love with it.
rent comes out tomorrow.
im totally seeing it when i get off work.
im excited like whoa."

"event","i like totally just got out of a david broza concert and it was the most amazing thing ever. he is such a beautiful person and uhh, just makes the most beautiful music and is so amazingly talented. i want to have his children so they can hopefully have an ounce of the tallent and passion he has. he talked about rabin and i almost wanted to cry. he wasnt even trying to be that emotional, but his pre encore speach was beautiful. before the db concert there was another concert where beth schafer and craig taubman played a little diddy. also a comedian that was funny. apparently he has twin little girls, but he looks like he is about 15. and even before that marc and i hung out, bonded and window shopped. there was a guy who makes ketubas so we talked to him. he like personalizes them for the couple and its so cool. i may have to remember that one day. there is a microcalagraphist there, but not my guy... the guy across the street. i was a little sad.

i also realised a few things. a few people in my life need closure letters. like im tired of you and other things... just in letter form. i cant decide how short they need to be, becuase some.. or at least one could get quite long. it was interesting seeing some people this weekend. 

i also came up with some ideas for my photo project. and some exibitors are going to be there tomorrow and let me take pictures of their stuff. woot for me!

i also have voted in favor of getting a chamsa necklace. so yay for that as well.

otherwise that is all that is good in the world for right now. i saw my mom and grandfather today and both are well. which makes me happy. untill later......"

"event","point a:
my grandfather is good, everything with the surgery went ok. 
he wants to go home already.
the dr. wont let him though.
but im about to head over there and we are going to go for a walk around the hospital.

point b:
johnny has some surprise for me and i have no idea what it is.
i do have some hints however... here they are:
<em>C & C
apple
can hear the wavelength at 10 feet (according to heath.)
wacky
cant see it</em>
any ideas?

point c:
my mom patronizing me is not cool.
heather here is what i need you to do. go to the store, buy a rubbermaid for liquids, somethting with a lid that you can screw on. then drive over to hampton, in the first kitchen papa has some containers of tea, but they are in pitchers. rinse out the rubbermaid then put the tea into the rubbermaid. screw the lid on very tight so nothing will spill on your way over here.

point d:
my keyboard keeps squeaking.
its freaking annoying.

point e:
kelly l. levy is coming into town tomorrow.
and i may be lucky enough to see her.
i am so excited."

for those of you who do not know my grandfather... sucks to be you becuase he is one of the coolest people in the entire world, and my favorite person ever.
So i'm coming equiped with a bagel, left over mac and cheese, audrey hepurn movies for us to watch and some aqua teen hunger fource to upload to...

so if you are looking for a new video ipod 30gig black.... let me know.
hmm, ripping dvds is fun.

"event","Wow, finally I can actually update this thing! Most of the internet hookups at the hostels I've been at don't let you get to the page necessary for updating livejournal for whatever reason...not to mention the fact that I've been checking email and stuff as quickly as possible since I'm paying for it. 

ANYWAY

Where to begin?

I guess I'll start with now. Right now I am in a hostel in Edinburgh, Scotland called the Castle Rock. It's right in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle and it's very cool. The common rooms look like Hogwarts and there are trippy murals all over the walls. It's 7:14 pm and Meredith and I have just gotten back from a six day backpackers tour of Scotland. Prior to that we did a five day tour of of western England and Wales with the same company, Haggis, which I HIGHLY recommend. Before THAT we were in London for about three days.

We've seen so much and met so many people...just the thought of trying to summarize all of it is very overwhelming, but I'll give you some highlights. 

One of the coolest things we saw in London was a free show outside the National Theater right by the water. It was a really nice summer night and we got a drink and watched these crazy German guys do these fire and pyrotechnic tricks and things. Very cool and slightly terrifying as things were blowing up and we were getting soaked by foam and hoses.

Our first Haggis tour was incredible, mostly because we met some amazing people, most of which were Australian (definitely a theme so far on this trip and I suspect most other people's trips as well). The constant joke on that tour was this older, single American guy who we ultimately named ""The General"" due to his constant need to organize and pontificate. We were going into a supermarket to buy food for a group meal we were going to cook at this farmhouse turned hostel in Wales (definitely the coolest place we've stayed so far) and he actually called roll and assigned us jobs before we went in. Unbelievable. Bath, Snowdonia, a crazy night in the Lake District, karaoke in Edinburgh, a very cute and funny Scottish guide named Rab, a totally bizarre show at the Fringe festival, drinking Crownies with the Aussies...all of it was amazing. We miss our friends from that trip a lot already, especially Kim, one of the Australian girls we got pretty close to.

Anyway, after that tour we ended up in Edinburgh and spent a day before getting on the 6 day Scotland tour. I didn't think it was possible, but our next Scottish tour guide (Davey) was even cuter and cooler. Especially when he wore a kilt- amazing. This time the bus was about 90% Australians, many of whom were very outgoing and fun. The only other American girl is from Weymouth which was kind of weird. Other than the millions of Aussies there were four Indians, one Taiwanese girl, one Kiwi, and this INSANE German couple. Some of you know about my uncle Milan...this one German guy was so much like him, it was terrifying. We so many great beautiful things like the Isle of Skye, Glencoe, Ullapool, a working Whisky distillary, this incredible hike up to a big rock called the Old Man of Storr on Skye where there was this amazing misty view over the Lochs and over the ocean to the mainland. We took a cruise on Lock Ness, got soaked in the horrible weather and rain, saw the bridge from Harry Potter...

One night we stayed in this incredible ""haunted"" castle in the middle of nowhere and walked to this hole in the wall pub about 15 minutes away. On the way back, the lights on the path  actually went out. So it was pitch black, with a full moon on one side and the lit-up haunted castle on the other. Meredith and I were walking with these super cool Indian newlyweds, counting on the husband, Muffi, to protect us. Of course he was scared out of his mind and was no help at all. It was pretty funny. Last night we went to a pretty cool pub in Inverness where there was traditional dancing that Meredith participated in. I took pictures of course. Today on the bus everyone sang their national anthems, mostly because I made the mistake of telling everyone I was a singer and it was their way of roping me into singing. So I sang the Star Spangled banner on a yellow bus full of Australians in the middle of Scotland today. Pretty sure that will never happen again, right?

Ok, I have no idea how much this is going to cost but I'm afraid it's going to be a lot so I'm going to sign off. If I didn't make it obvious enough, we are seriously having the time of our lives. I'll be honest though, we're beat tonight and kind of just want to find a television on which to watch an episode of the Simpsons or something. We'll see."

"event","I think this might be my last entry for awhile. I sort of woke up one morning and felt like I'd out-grown livejournal. I think maybe it was the effort I put into the retrospective. As soon as I finished I thought, I'd be ok with never using livejournal again. Anyway, this will be it for awhile for a variety of reasons about which I won't bother going into great detail- not out of a desire to be cryptic, just because they are boring and hard to explain...not at all juicy or even mildly interesting.

I'm just getting really sick of all things ""online."" Facebook is the new bane of my existence. If you're looking for a really good way to feel completely un-original, cruise around facebook for awhile looking at all the hundreds of people who like exactly the same shit you like. I don't care how original you think you are- throwing in some obscure band or weird movie nobody's heard of- somebody else on facebook will say the same thing and you will both instantly cease to be hip. 

I have this theory that thousands of clones were made of this one girl somewhere, they were each given black Northface fleeces and Ugg boots and some evil mastermind set them loose on college campuses across America. It's CREEPY.

This has been a really difficult week. Despite all my preventative efforts, I got sick last weekend. I'm also trying to deal with a really annoying situation with one of my classes involving all kinds of stupid academia-type red-tape issues. It's mostly bothering me because it's one of those things where it seems like I was the irresponsible party when in reality I was a victim of bad guidance and advice on the part of advisors and the like. ANYWAY it's frustrating. 

Life on 6A has been good since the advent of the futon. Our room has become quite a hub of social activity. Futons have a way of bringing people together, don't they?

As for other big news, I'm no longer going to be a music ed. major. I've been doing a lot of thinking since getting accepted into the music performance program and I ultimately came to the conclusion I've always known I would come to. I wasn't lying when I said I wanted to teach. I do. I just want that part of my life to come later when I can teach at the college level or privately and do choral conducting that isn't high school. Also, if I don't do the double degree thing there's the possibility I will graduate a full year earlier than I would otherwise (meaning I'd graduate in 2007 like I was supposed to all along). Also, I'll be able to study abroad (probably Vienna in fall 2006) which is really important to me. 

Basically, doing the double degree would be a big mistake. I could do it, but I would be completely over-extended. I don't want to make the same mistake I made in high school. It would be stupid not to take advantage of the fact that I'm at the top school for voice in the country and squander all the resources that come with that. My voice and my attitude toward singing have come a really long way in the past two years. I think I have the opportunity to do something big and I refuse to blow that. Plus, just doing the performance degree gives me breathing room since there are fewer requirements. More time to practice, work and save money, etc. etc. 

Anyway, I'm happy with my choice but a little weirded out by how abruptly I made the decision. It's like what happened with livejournal. I just woke up one day and knew what I had to do. If anything, that gives me more confidence in the rightness of the whole thing. 

So in some ways, I'm happier than I've ever been. I'm excited. I don't feel trapped anymore. I don't feel like my life is headed in one direction and one direction only. I thought trying to do everything would give me more options, but really it was cutting them down. So I'm glad I realized that.

In other ways...things are really rough right now. Like they told my parents in pre-school, I have transition issues. I'd be the sweetest, most well-behaved kid ever while we were doing play-dough, but when we made the switch to finger paint I would totally freak out. Then after a while I'd settle into the finger paint thing and everything would be cool until it was pasta-necklace time and then the whole cycle would start again. It always takes me longer to move on. I've always been this way in my life- with little things and with big things. Like at pool parties everybody would get bored with swimming except me. I could have stayed in the pool all night but everyone else wanted to watch a movie or some shit.  

Anyway, I feel like that's what's happening here too. I'm really resisting giving up on the life I knew back in W.N. even though I don't fit in there anymore. I'm a completely different person...I don't see how it could be any other way considering everything that's happened since it all went to hell at the end of senior year. Semester break was...illuminating in that way.  Home isn't really ""safe"" anymore. Nowhere is ""safe"" anymore and I'm having trouble dealing with that. Just because it's ""home"" doesn't mean people are going to be any more careful with your feelings or that you're immune from getting an emotional kick in the gut from time to time. I learned that the hard way, but at least I learned it.  

So yeah, if you're curious about how I've been, I'll sum it up. I'm happy here. Things are great.  Simultaneously, I'm frustrated by the fact that there are always bumps in the road and that there probably always will be bumps in the road. I'm restless. It sucks not having a car. There's so much to do but usually we don't do anything and that bothers me. I hate being tired and bored at the same time. Vicious cycle. I'm frustrated by guys for two reasons 1) I've made the decision that I will never again pursue a guy because let's face it, it may be anti-feminist or something, but guys do the pursuing. Maybe one time in a million it works the other way around, but usually you (me) just end up making a complete fool out of yourself for no reason because you realize by the end that you don't even like this other person. As they say in ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" there's a reason it has worked this way for thousands of years. (Oh God, am becoming Bridget Jones) 2) The problem with this resolution is that there have to be guys out there willing to pursue you. This could be a major flaw in the plan. 

Fuck it, I think I'll go read Harry Potter and have some peanut M&Ms.

Peace out for now LJ and extended LJ community. If you want to know what I'm up to, you might just have to call me."

"event","So this post is going to be about a weird dream but DON'T STOP READING because it will be worth your while. 


This dream I had was quite long, complicated and strange but one part stands out. After seeing it advertised on television, I went to a restaurant called ""Tard."" It was very colorful with a pink carpet and lots of bubbly looking furniture. Everything was sort of padded, presumably because at least one member of every party eating at ""Tard"" was, frankly, retarded. Now, upon examining the food, I came to the conclusion that it was fare from the adjacent T.G.I. Friday's. I thought ""Tard"" would have some kind of special food. The fact that it didn't confused me. Looking around, I could not for the life of me figure out why this establishment was especially for people with special needs, with the possible exception of the slightly modified furniture. Still, I started feeling increasingly uncomfortable being, well, not retarded. So we left.


WHY WOULD MY BRAIN COME UP WITH THAT? With all the other stuff that's been on my mind, (mass death and destruction, the meaning of life, boys) why would it conjure up such a bizarre scenario that is, as far as I can tell, not even remotely based on anything I have experienced or even thought about in real life?


A side note- Meredith will be pleased to know I spilled not once, but twice at Friendly's last night. First it was an entire spoonful of chocolate ice cream right on the crotch. Then when I stood up to put my coat on I knocked over a glass of ice. Why? WHYYYYYYYYYY?"

"event","Is it normal to be stressed out about going to a day at the spa? Probably not. I need like, directions or something. Like instructions on how to go about the whole thing. For example, what do I wear? Also, should I not wear make-up since I'm getting a facial? I don't want to show up without make-up cause I'd like to look nice since it's a nice place but it seems like it would be stupid to wear make-up. I mean, there would probably be an opportunity to like, remove the make-up pre-facial..like wearing make-up to the gym or something...which of coruse, I've done. So really, it boils down to which is more embarrassing, showing up without make-up and looking like shit or showing up with make-up and looking like an idiot. 


What if I do something terrible...like fart during the massage. That would SO be something I would do. But like, what if I really have to and the whole massage will be ruined by me trying really hard not to fart? I can totally see that happening. 

Really though, I'm such a moron for freaking out about this. Well, and for freaking out about everything in general. I need to go to bed. 

DON'T FORGET THE YANKEE SWAP!!

"event","So I will be leaving Bloomington on Tuesday afternoon. It kinda snuck (sneeked? sneaked?) up on me. It's incredible how much I've actually done in the past two weeks. Thanksgiving feels like two months ago. It was a total blur. It will be really nice to go home knowing I have a fair amount of time stretched out ahead of me and no work hanging over my head. 


Let's see...on Wednesday night we had the big Singing Hoosiers Chimes of Christmas concert. Aside from looking absolutely hideous in the dress I had to wear, and getting a huge blister from my character shoes, it was pretty cool. The fake snow at the end was pretty badass. On Thursday at rehearsal we watched the tape of the risers falling at homecoming. I think it was Sally who made the good point that it's too bad America's Funniest Home Videos isn't still on the air...Singing Hoosiers could have won $10,000. I don't think I'll ever feel comfortable on risers ever again. 

We went Christmas shopping on Friday followed by Chili's. Parts of it were sort of a nightmare because we were (read: I was) all cranky and tired and bitchy. Still, it was a worthwhile endeavor. When we came back we watched Empire Strikes Back in the lounge and I officially became the biggest dork ever. That's actually not true. Cody and Sally completely out-dork me when it comes to Star Wars. I wouldn't have pegged either of them as big Star Wars nerds...especially Cody. He's too well-dressed and hygienic (not that Sally isn't, but I know her well enough not to be too surprised when her dorkiness shows). It's probably a good thing though, really, that I'm easily out Star Wars dorked. 

""I love you!""
""I know.""

(What if I didn't type that for the sake of irony? Would anyone still hang out with me?)

I'm losing it. 

Top ten things I'm looking forward to at home:
1) Yankee Swap! (Ya'll better be there.)
2) Tubes of cookie dough. 
3) Shopping in Boston.
4) Wrapping presents. 
5) Baking.
6) Vegetables.
7) It's a Wonderful Life
8) Shit I can't think of anymore.
9) I mean, beside the obvious ones. 
10) Like seeing everybody and driving my car again.

Sally just said my livejournal entries are all depressing. I think that's my cue to stop writing."

...found out I had a negative checking account balance. 

...forgot to zip up my fly. (I should also mention this happened yesterday too. Luckily it was only for a brief period in both cases). 

...couldn't play the National Anthem on piano. 

...had at least 3 awkward encounters. 

...made what was supposed to be a 10 minute presentation a 5 minute presentation.

...accidentally made a racist comment. 

...spent 15 minutes looking for an i.d. that ended up being in my wallet all along.

...forgot my umbrella.

It is official now that I am indeed a complete idiot. I suppose I'm ok with it. I wouldn't be me without the constant spilling, losing, forgetting, and talking too much. 

I have to say though, the whole doing stupid shit all the time thing is getting a little old. 

On the bright side, there was a very attractive guy working today at B.M.S. (Big Mouth Subs for those of you not in the know) and we had a very nice interaction. The best part: I was wearing high-heeled shoes and he was still taller than me...but not like, freakishly so. More like just right so. Anyway, I guess that's what happens when I take the time to shower and put on real pants.   

Or maybe it was all in my head and I'm actually freakishly ugly and nobody's ever had the courtesy to tell me. I hope that's not the case. 

I would like to wish you all a happy Festival of Lights but I don't know how to spell it.

I come home in a week. I'm considering just sleeping from now until then and saying screw it to all the shit in between. I'm so tired. I'm running out of steam. When you can't even remember to zip your pants, you have a problem."

"event","Another interesting week in the never-ending joke that is my life. It's like one of those really long stupid jokes that starts to piss people off so much they don't even give a shit about the punch line but they wait for it anyway and then it ends up being even more stupid than they expected. You know the kind of joke I mean. 

It's a bad idea to do the livejournal things at times like these. It's very late. For me, like drunkenness, excessive lateness and fatigue often leads to oversharing. Hopefully that won't be necessary. 

Current thoughts:

I think I'm having some sort of existential crisis. Like a whole ""But what does it all MEAN??"" situation. 

I'm really excited for the Christmas party. And Christmas in general. 

I want to go home so I can feel cool again. 

It's a really weird feeling to achieve something you once thought was completely impossible. Not entirely a good feeling either. Kind of scary, actually. 

I miss my old self. The optimistic, philosophical, always ready for a deep Dunkin Donuts conversation Julia of two years ago seems to be fading away to make room for a more jaded (and considerably heavier) Julia.

I'm angry with myself for watching so many romantic comedies over the course of my life. 

Despite the fact that ever-increasing weight gain and romantic movies seem to be a big part of my problem, I am counting the days until Meredith and I can eat cookie dough from the tube and watch said movies. 

Why do I get wrapped up in things so easily and so blindly? I mean, I figure it out eventually and go through the whole ""Wait, what was I thinking?"" process, but only after it's too late and I'm already involved whether I want to be or not. 

I think my life is at a deceptive cadence right now. I'm somewhere in the vi chord (assuming life is in a major key, which we all know it's not. Think Travis lyrics). It's like, whoa, thought you were going to I but bam! you've gone to vi. A new phrase is about to start and I have no idea how it's going to end.(This has been part of a new attempt at being more of a music nerd). 

Livejournal has started to make me feel narcissistic and childish. Sort of like, ""Look at me! Look at me!"" Aren't I too old for that kind of thing? I mean, all things considered, I'm a pretty successful human being. I know that. I'm where I want to be. I've worked hard and I'm working hard and I'm pretty happy with myself in the broadest sense...but I constantly need positive feedback and encouragement and reinforcement. Is everyone like that or just me? I really wish I wasn't like that. 

I just need to remember to relax and ya know, carpe diem and shit.

Blah, fuck it all. Sometimes the only thing left to do is go to sleep.

Plans for tomorrow?

Buy things for myself. 
Eat ice-cream. (Unless alcohol presents itself). 
See Garden State.

I just might do these things alone. And I just might be ok with that.

ADDENDUM: I can let a lot of character flaws in other people go, mostly because I have so many of my own and it's only fair, but one that really gets me is saying you're going to do something and not doing it. I can't handle that, especially when it has a direct effect on somebody else's life. I mean, sometimes life happens and you can't follow through and there are reasons (or you're like me and you just forget everything), but if you have no intention of doing something in the first place, don't say you're going to. It really frustrates me. Just thought I'd toss another little rant in here for flavor."

I guess I already mentioned Sarah's on Wednesday.

Thursday was Thanksgiving. It was crazy. Milan was amazing, as always. Highlights of this year include ""Art can be anything. Is very Avant-garde- is, could be- dog poop!"" and ""Julie, you, you generation, you must start...CULTURAL REVOLUTION!"" God I wish I was kidding about this stuff...

Once I was free from the fam. on Thursday night I was pleasantly surprised by the company of DAVE and JENNY which was more than awesome. Jenny and I reminisced about The Great Red Ant Incident of 199_. We went to the beach (!) and it was breathtakingly amazing. We froliced, of course. 

Friday was Andrew and then Sam's house where I got to see some more good people I haven't seen in awhile. I took a forbidden Miller Lite by accident and felt bad about it but Sam forgives me so it's cool. 

On Saturday the mother, the brother, Andrew and I had breakfast at Angie's...the classic choice. Following that we walked around Newburyport for awhile which was quite refreshing and strangely something I've never done with my mother before. 

Later on Saturday we purchased our Christmas tree- the first time in Snowden history a tree has been purchased before December. It's quite nice...not as tall as we usually have but it still looks good. It's also a little crooked, but I'm trying to look on the bright side. 

Saturday night was Sczechuan Taste and Bridget Jones 2 with the girls. I loved the movie, of course, because hello I'm a total girl...we all know this. After that we said some goodbyes at Jon's and so ended my Thanksgiving break. 

I did a lot of other crap with my family that I didn't bother mentioning...like raking leaves and shit. I love my parents...and my brother even though he was kind of a dick all weekend. The house looks really good. The grand piano is back...I have a new bed. All is well. Emma was glad to see me too and Rosie is still alive. 

Today my flight from Cincinnati to Indy was cancelled. I'll spare you the whiney details but it really was a pain in the ass. They bused (or vanned) us to Indianapolis and then I got a ride to Bloomington with some girl from IU which worked out nicely. She had a Lexus. We got Wendy's and had a very nice conversation. 

I'm tired. My head hurts. And this was a completely unnecessary re-cap."

On the other hand, a little overwhelming. My brain was on overload at Sarah's tonight seeing so many people at once. Amazing how easy it is to fall back into old feelings and drama. Gah. I really need to learn how to turn my brain off and stop thinking so damn much.  

Today (well, yesterday I suppose) is Sarah's birthday and therefore the 7 year anniversary of my friendship with Jen. Hard to believe. We've come along way from the infamous chicken coop face-off...or have we? :)

I'm used to coming home and turning on late night TV in the kitchen but it's too late even for that. I hate that college has made 3:00 a.m. a normal time to be awake. 

Not much has changed here in three months. The driveway is paved, the floor in the addition is different, the grand piano is back...that tombstone place next to Wendy's is gone, there's a new building at Port Plaza, a new yellow line in the road on Maple Street, and a new house next to the Episcopal Church...my brother has gained weight, my mother has lost weight...there's a bike path on High Street in Nport (not cool)...and the beach seems to have eroded some. Oh and the Park Lunch burnt down (sort of).

Seeing Andrew and going to Louisville was awesome. I feel really lucky to have constants in my life like that. I mean, when I met Andrew four years ago, I never would have guessed our lives would bring us to his parents kitchen table in Kentucky, finishing off a bottle of wine and talking about our new realities. But that right there is the essence of what I love about life...never having any idea where you're going to end up or who you'll be having one of those conversations with in 5, 10, 30 years. Anyway, it brought me back to myself a little bit. I forgot what an amazing comfort it is just to sit and talk to someone who knows pretty much everything about you.

Of course, the process that gets two people to that point is pretty amazing too.

ANYWAY 


I suppose now is as good a time as ever:

ATTENTION!

Because last year was such a success, it seems only appropriate to announce the...

SECOND ANNUAL YANKEE SWAP/CHRISTMAS PARTY

Where? 

78 Maple W.N.

When? 

Thursday, December 23rd, 7:00. 
(We did the 23rd last year and it seemed to work out pretty well but I'm open to other suggestions at this point).

Why? 

Because you had such an amazing fucking time last year.

Who? 

Something like 25-30 people showed up over the course of the night last year so I will be expecting no less! In other words YOU are invited. Yes, YOU. Word of mouth got people there last year so I'm counting on it working again.

But Julia, what exactly is a ""yankee swap""? 

Don't worry about the exact rules. It would be annoying for me to explain. Just bring a wrapped gift ($10 maximum) and rest assured you will leave with a present of some sort. There were some really awesome gifts last year.

Intriguing, but what should I wear?

You guys didn't do very well with the festive attire rule last year. I think we can do better this time. So really it's whatever ""festive attire"" means to you. To me, it means dressing up a little. To you it might mean a blinking Christmas tie or some of those musical socks that play Jingle Bell Rock...it really doesn't matter. Just be festive. 

...just BE THERE."

I really need to work on this in-class essay shit for theory. It's the only real thing between me and Thanksgiving break. 

Today in Singing Hoosiers I started crying. I mean, it wasn't obvious. I contained myself, but you know. We were just singing the fucking Christmas Festival medley and it made me think of the orchestral version we listen to at least 500 times at my house every Christmas and out of nowhere I got all emotional. It totally came out of the blue. (*cough* PMS *cough*)

I then came home and put on some John Rutter (which immediately took me back to Drelich days) and cried some more. It actually felt really good. I've only cried one other time this semester and it was at the end of Philadelphia. That particular cry was cut short by my roommate coming in and proclaiming ""Ugh, I really need to take a dump."" Hilarious? Yes. Do I wish I could have continued crying? Yes. This kind of living situation is a blessing and a curse for that reason. The upside is, you're never alone. It's hard to stay depressed when you're constantly surrounded by friends. The downside is, you're never alone.

I am currently in a fantastic mood. I had a very successful audition today. Looks like I'll be doing a dual Performance/Education degree. It will be challenging but I'm really pumped. 

I've been feeling all warm and fuzzy towards my parents today. I asked my dad if he would make me breakfast on Wednesday morning when I come home (I'm flying in Tuesday night) and he was really cute about it. The conversation went something like: 

Me: So dad, will you make me breakfast on Wednesday?
Dad: Eggs with cheese and peppers?
Me: Yeah exactly! And some corn muffins?
Dad: With blueberries or without?
Me: Some with, some without?
Dad: You got it. 

It was cute. And then when I told him my audition went well he told me to go out and get myself an ice cream cone. Sometimes my parents are hilarious.

A lot of the stressful stuff I had to do this week is done with (with a couple major exceptions) so I'm considerably more relaxed. Also, I've got a lot to look forward to in the near future so that has put me in a good state of mind. 

I can't fucking wait to go home! It will be so great to see everyone, even if I have gained like, 900 lbs. since coming here. Kinda like the Freshman Fifteen...but more like the...Transfer Ton. 

You know what I'm REALLY excited about? Christmas music. 

How is it already midnight? Oh well. 

It will be nice to not think about school for a little while at home. I feel a little disconnected from myself...like I've been in this little tiny world for so long that I've lost some of myself. Maybe it's just that I'm ""changing."" Ha! Well, we'll see. I need a philosophical talk with Dave, a Ben Folds drive with Seth, a Barnes and Noble trip with Meredith, a Plum Island trip with Sarah, a hands-dance with Chen and Chatelyn...etc., etc.

I would really rather not be awake right now. 

Last night was one of those weird nights where I had dreams similar to things that actually happened so I'm not sure what's real and what's not. I'm pretty sure I was dreaming when I asked my roommate to be quiet and she started yelling at me. I don't think that would happen in actual life. Pretty scary, actually.

I'm glad it's just about weekend time but I sort of just want to fast-forward to the next one. Andrew is coming down which I'm really excited about. We're probably going to go down to Louisville to see the new house and the rest of the Stefka clan. Maybe we'll sit around and play with toy cars like we did that day over the summer. That was weird. Anyway, then a couple days after that I will be flying back to the MA. Gah! I can't wait!  

As Thanksgiving approaches, one man has been constantly on my mind. Who is that man, you ask? Why Uncle Milan of course! I haven't seen him in quite some time. I look forward to barely comprehensible tales of ""hashish,"" bad American road signage, his apparent former life as a Czechoslovakian lounge singer...God, he makes me uncomfortable. But, seeing as he is responsible for the endearing painting of me and my family, (in which I am represented as a cylinder with a leaf on the top), I suppose I will try to be patient and nice and not look for every available opportunity to get the hell away from my him (and my aunt too for that matter). Really though, holidays at my house can be pretty hilarious. Like the time we had Cornish Game Hens at Christmas. They were all piled up together on a plate...I mean, everybody was thinking it. I just didn't think my dad would actually say it.

Thanks to some bonus points, I got a perfect score on my last theory exam (although, Andrew kindly pointed out that 140/140 is not technically a perfect score if there were bonus points involved because technically I didn't get every possible point). Anyway, I bring this up not to gloat, but to mention that my theory teacher wrote the following on top of my test:

""Holy Perfect Score, Batman!""

...Best teacher feedback ever? I think so.

So I mean, all in all, life is good. It could be great if I stopped thinking so damn much but it's not likely that that will happen anytime soon. Thanksgiving will be much needed therapy and a good chance to take a step back from everything going on here. It's easy to get wrapped up in this little college world. I've never spent this much time in one place. I need the plane flight and the beach and my car and my old friends to get things back in perspective. I really might just get on the highway and drive for a really long time when I get home. No destination, just driving for the sake of driving.

This is so corny, but lately whenever I start feeling sorry for myself, I keep thinking about how my life is really just one big embarrassment of riches: A loving (albeit dysfunctional) family, more good friends (new and old) than I deserve, relative financial security, an education, no weird physical deformities or diseases or extreme ugliness (hopefully)...It seems silly to complain about all the petty things I may have to complain about. Seriously, I go to bed every night knowing I have a future. Not everyone can say that. 

Anyway, now that I've been all stupid and serious and shit...

I think the name of the game in my life right now is to try and maintain a sense of humor. Meredith and I had a long talk about this past year and how crazy and weird and just...eventful it has been for me. Keep your eyes peeled for ""2004: A Year in Review"" a couple months from now. It should be entertaining. I promise tales of vomit, one-night stands, run-ins with the cops (well, rent-a-cops), and alcohol-induced slips of the tongue (both literally and figuratively).

School?

Boring. 

I could tell the chocolate pudding story. Yeah, I think you guys will like that. Not that I write in this for anyone other than myself. Ha. Seriously though, the only reason I do this is so that I can get lots of comments and feel good about myself. Just kidding. (Or am I?)  

So I think it was yesterday (could have been Monday, who knows) I came back from class for a midday Snack Pak and a nap. I got up, farted around for awhile, and walked to Italian. An important part of this story is the fact that I passed and greeted many people en route to class. So I went to class. We watched a movie. After class I went to the bathroom, waited in line, did my business and then went to wash my hands. Now, upon looking into the obligatory above-the-sink mirror I discovered a large brown smear on my forehead. What could it be you ask? (Not THAT! Gross!) Well, loyal Julia fans, I think you will have no trouble believing that I had somehow managed to get chocolate pudding on my forehead. Not only that, but I managed to walk all the way to Ballantine and sit through an entire class in such a state. At least we were watching a movie.

Also related to chocolate, some of you may remember an infamous entry from September 2003 regarding a vending machine and a package of peanut M&Ms. I had a very similar (eerily similar) experience tonight. But Sally was with me this time and it all worked out much better.

So basically, my life is just one big battle with chocolate. 

In other news, I don't really know. Life is totally weird and confusing and I've been feeling very disoriented. Much happier and more content than I've felt in a long time but disoriented nonetheless. I guess I'm just settling into feeling settled-in if that makes any sense.

I haven't been counting the days till Thanksgiving the way I was at the beginning of the semester but I have to say, I am really looking forward to getting off the plane in Boston and seeing my family waiting for me. Whoa cheese alert. But seriously, that's going to be awesome. 

Sometimes 6A really feels like a weird alternate universe. Like, sometimes when the elevator doors open and I step onto the floor I really feel like I've disconnected myself from the rest of the world. Even my sense of time gets all messed up. For example, last time I looked at the clock it said 12:00 and then what felt like two minutes later it said 12:30. What the hell? I think it's the non-fluorescent lights in the hallway.

Oh man. The rest of this semester should be interesting. Bring it on!"

"event","Life has been kicking my ass lately. Maybe it's because I didn't give those people in the mall money for the children's hospital.

So I got a replacement phone for the one I lost. Really ghetto but it worked- so fine, great, whatever...

Now that phone is broken. It will not work. It looks like there's water behind the screen or something. How did that happen? I really don't know. 

And remember the story about the risers at rehearsal the other day? Well that happened again...during our homecoming performance this morning. Amazing. 


Anyway, all you can do is laugh I guess. Things like terminal illness or I dunno, venereal diseases or something are real problems. Cell phones and minor collapsing riser injuries don't really add up to much.

AND I got to ride on a firetruck last night in the homecoming parade so how bad can life really be? Considering I thought I was going to have to walk, it was quite a pleasant surprise. I laughed at all the firetruck riding virgins. All those West Newbury Memorial Day parades served me well. 

Of course, I didn't get to see THE parade. Cait talked to Johnny Damon. I'm jealous. My dad and brother went too. They were going to call me but of course MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK.

Anyway, I refuse to let today be anything less than a good day. So here goes."

"event","I keep updating in the morning. I think it has to do with my severe procrastination issues. I have an assignment that needs to be done within the next hour that I completely forgot about until late last night, hence, I got up much earlier than I wanted to in order to do it. It's possible I've never been this tired before. Like, ever. I'm also having a big problem with one of my wisdom teeth. It must be popping up even more cause it hurts like hell and when I bite down I hit gum. My neck and shoulders feel like a solid rock too. Ok, just had to get that stuff out of the way. Enough complaining. 

Wednesday night(/Thursday morning) makes the top three of weirdest nights of my life, largely because of the Sox. It was right up there with the ""...and then my dad stepped in my vomit"" night on the weirdness scale, but 100x better. Hey, I mean, the Red Sox won. I had to celebrate somehow. Staying up all night seemed like the thing to do. And really, I'm not complaining because sometimes it's worth being dead tired and probably on your way to getting sick. ""Bad ideas"" are the stuff of life.

I finally got suckered into joining facebook. I'm one of the losers without a picture right now because I need to find a good one. This is all I need...another fucking online distraction. I don't know how I'm going to get everything done before the end of this semester. I wish I could just stop worrying about it. I mean, if there's one thing I know about myself, it is that I will find a way to do well in school no matter what. It's like an illness. 
  
One last thing that might amuse you: Yesterday at Singing Hoosiers we rehearsed on risers. Being tall and all that, I was on the very last riser in the back (read: had the furthest to fall). Anyway, we're doing our singing hoosiers thing, you know, I'm step-touching my brains out and suddenly BAM the set of risers I was on completely falls apart and everyone comes crashing to the ground. I banged my knee pretty bad but it's fine now. I guess they were just old and rickety or not in a locked position or something. Anyway, it was a pretty hilarious image...and I can say that because luckily nobody was really hurt or anything.

Ok, theory assignment and long-ass terrible day here I come. I had wanted to go out tonight but that's completely not going to happen. I'm really looking forward to just being able to relax with nothing hanging over my head tonight."

I really haven't been sleeping enough lately...but that's kind of ok with me. 

It pretty much sucks not being home for the World Series. It's going to be a pretty historic/dramatic next couple weeks between the Sox and the election. One of those landmark times I'm going to feel obligated to remember twenty years from now. I feel like I need to be paying attention to everything at all times. 

I guess the most important bit of news in my life right now is that I lost my cell phone last week. I don't think I really have to explain how much that sucks. It's been deactivated and I'm working on the replacement process. Mostly I'm upset about losing all the numbers. Yuck. Anyway, if you try to call it will say ""this number is no longer in service"" or some shit like that. Hopefully I'll have a new one soon.

I have at least two of Sarah's shirts that she probably lent me in 1998...and those slippers that Melissa Mchoweverthefuckyouspellit left at my house sophomore year...and Kelsey's New Kids on the Block Christmas cassette tape from second grade.

"event","I wonder why rainy days make me feel so happy. The opposite happens for most people. My parents tell me it was pouring rain and stormy when my mom went into labor with me. Maybe that has something to do with it. I woke up early this morning to study and there was a lot of thunder and lightening and the floor was really quiet cause everyone was still sleeping and I dunno, it was just really nice. The twenty minute walk to my Communications midterm wasn't as nice though. Mostly because there is no drainage on this campus. That sounds weird but it's true. I mean, it's been pretty rainy but not freakishly so and parts of the campus are already quite flooded. I'd hate to see what happens when there's an above average amount of rain. 


I had a really weird weekend. I went shopping on Friday which was fantastic. Old Navy had a lot of stuff on sale. Good times. As hard as I try to be an interesting non-materialistic person who finds fulfillment in things like books and knowledge and shit like that, there's really no substitute for shopping...and I'm not ashamed to say it. Later on Friday night I had an interesting conversation with a decidedly not sober Andrew and friends. This also involved an enlightening chat with Kate Cosgrove. Blast from the past there. 

After the Sox game on Saturday (which I subjected myself to right up to the end) I somehow ended up getting drunk alone in my room. Yes, I drank alone. I should make the clarification that it wasn't really my intention to be alone, but it just sort of ended up that way. I had company at certain points in the evening but the height of my drunkenness definitely occurred while I was in my room by myself. I didn't even know what to do. I tried to read a Time magazine at one point but that didn't work out so well since you know, reading becomes sort of difficult when the words won't stay still. I really have nobody to blame but myself. I mean, I declined two separate invitations to go out which would have been the much more normal thing to do. Oh well. 

Yesterday involved vomiting about 5 times and just generally feeling like crap the whole day. I don't know if it was all alcohol related or not. I haven't been feeling well anyway. Blah. And then the game which pissed me off cause it kept me from studying for my midterm which, incidentally, ended up being incredibly easy and I shouldn't have even worried about it at all.    

This was a really sub-par post. I'm sorry."

Like cheating or something. I mean, when you're this far away from home for this long you start to feel like everything back there is suspended. It's unnatural to imagine it any other way...everything going on like it normally does without you (even though that's exactly what happens). Kids will go to Caffe Di, driveways will be paved, milk will be bought at the food-mart, Dana Marshall will play Bruce Cockburn on her radio show...I know this. But I'd rather pretend everything is just suspended Saved by the Bell style and I'm Zack Morris, able to start and stop it with a snap of my fingers. Deep, I know. 

...That was so annoying though because you could ALWAYS see people moving. I'm only willing to suspend my disbelief so far.  

A small anecdote (Elyse especially will be interested):

So today on my way to Singing Hoosiers I got on the elevator with our director, Dr. Schwartzkopf and three guests of his. Now, Dr. S. is definitely well above 60. I'd been thinking possibly 70+. So naturally, I was surprised when he introduced one of his companions as his mother. She didn't seem as old as she should be. It's very confusing. But that's sort of beside the point. Anyway, the other woman he was with was introduced as a friend from Germany. Now, upon saying this to me, Mamma Dr. S. said with a smile ""Turns out they look pretty much like us!"" Everyone laughs. Clearly this is a joke. But she doesn't stop. ""I was expecting them to look different, you know with those outfits...uh, Lay-tur-hozen?"" Suddenly this is awkward. ""But I guess that was a long time ago when they wore things like that."" Dr. S. mumbles something about it being a VERY long time ago and thankfully the elevator opens just as the German woman is saying ""Well, it's really only a very small part of the country that wears those."" The whole thing was very uncomfortable. I was cringing for all of America.


I'm NOT watching the game right now because we don't get fucking Fox Sports Network and regular Fox is playing the NLCS game. HIGHLY annoying."

This weekend I had many an adventure. On Friday night we went to see La Boheme here at IU. It was fantastic. I cried like a moron during basically all of the last act.

Right now we're listening to Total Eclipse of the Heart (off of Julia and Meredith: The Soundtrack). What a fantastic song. 

Last night we saw Garden State. It was a great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a really scary bus driver who was late and made us miss the first couple minutes of the movie. Stupid bitch. Just kidding. 

Today I did some laundry and realized I have an alarming number of face cloths. 

We had dinner at Applebee's which was delicious. Then we went to Wal-Mart where I bought Chex, instant outmeal, bread, Motrin, and curtain tie-back things which are fantastic. Our room looks classy now. 

I'm reading ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" right now and it is very good. 


Sleepwalker 47: Hurry up with your entry.
Jules6185: dude chill out
Sleepwalker 47: lol
Sleepwalker 47: I'm so ready for it.


The foliage isn't very impressive out here in Indiana. I guess that explains all the old people who drive around aimlessly in New England in the fall. 

I miss driving. Driving around is sort of an important part of my spiritual life...kind of like showering. The first thing I'm going to do when I get home is get in my car, roll down all the windows, put on some music (Perhaps the Super Epics mix?) and drive to Plum Island. Actually that will probably be like, the third or fourth thing I do when I get home, but you know.

I also got my eyebrows waxed with ""Jenny"" at the salon in the student union. She does a good job. Clean eyebrows make me very happy. I'm a simple girl. 

Lots of laughs in Italian today. I love that every foreign language textbook ever made has at least a few hilarious illustrations. ""Prego!"" is no exception. Today there was an extremely out of proportion old woman (think inverted triangle) weeping at a grave site and a balding man (with back hair popping out of his wife beater) waving a dead squirrel angrily at his dog.

In piano class we're learning a piece I played when I was 9 years old. My piano teacher took me to this festival and I had to play it in front of all these people and I got up and stage and literally froze. I couldn't even figure out which note to start on (the music was right in front of me).  Needless to say, there is a sad sad irony in playing it 10 years later 100x undertempo in a group piano class, struggling to hear yourself while four other people bang out E flats where they should be natural. Stupid piano. Whoever invented group piano class is a really dumb shit. Although, friends from Lowell will be pleased to know that my teacher is indeed Russian. Nowhere near as cool as Inge, but Russian nonetheless.

I've been meaning to mention this for a couple weeks now: Indiana played B.U. at soccer a little while ago here in Bloomington and the Singing Hoosiers did the anthem before the game and turns out Ian Maio was here playing. When they announced all the players and their hometowns (""From West Newbury, Massachusetts...Ian Maio!"") I freaked out. Anyway, just thought it was kind of interesting. If anyone talks to Ian tell him I saw him play (sort of...I couldn't tell which one he was) and I'm sorry B.U. lost. (I was secretly rooting for them). 

My mom visited over labor day weekend which was very cool. We ate at the Olive Garden which was fantastic. I feel like kind of a shitty person for going out and partying one of the nights she was here (see Rolling Rock Jeff entry) but what can you do.

I'm a volunteer usher at the IU Auditorium which I'm very excited about. I get to see all kinds of shows for free including Itzhak Perlman, Crazy for You, Jesus Christ Superstar, Nickel Creek, Dave Attel, the Full Monty, Les Mis next semester, etc., etc...so I'm pumped. Plus we get t-shirts. I love t-shirts. 

I also got a t-shirt for joining the Student Alumni Association. I'm wearing it right now. Then there's my Singing Hoosiers shirt...it's crazy! T-shirts are the best part of joining groups in college. 

I'm very excited about my voice lessons. I ended up with a great teacher and a great accompanist. So woo for that. 

So, in summary, I pretty much have everything I need in life...a girl on my floor to watch the all Russian channel with (Slavic Languages major), pleasant surroundings, friends to eat meals with, music, attractive males, and most importantly, many things to look forward to.  

P.S. I started out really on top of things here, but within the past three days I've forgotten 3 homework assignments, had to get a replacement ID, and lost a $400 check. Some things will never change."

I will be brief and general since it would be really easy go on and on and on in a very boring manner. The roommate is cool and we're are getting along famously. So far she has partied a lot more than me (which isn't difficult since I haven't been to an actual party yet) but not in an annoying way. My floor is quiet but really social and we've already gotten pretty close and comfortable which I like. I have classes with a couple girls on the floor and two of us will be singing in the same choral ensemble so it will be good.


I've met people from all over...approximately 2 from Massachusetts and neither of them had heard of West Newbury although one kid from Lexington knows of Pentucket as he is friends with Evan Fleischer (sp?) Evan, if you read this which you probably don't, I met a kid Brian from Lexington who knows you. Last night I met a kid from Maine who knew exactly where West Newbury was and it was music to my ears. He was like, ""Oh yeah, right next to Newburyport near Salisbury Beach."" I was really excited. His name was Tyson. Tyson from Bangor, Maine. Weird.


Everything I was worried about has basically been squared away. I'm studying with a teacher who seems to have a pretty good reputation, I have an accompanist and I did my choral auditions and I met with an adviser who knew what she was doing and led me in the right direction. So the moral of that story is that I'm considerably more relaxed now that I don't have all that crap hanging over my head. 

The only thing bothering me at the moment is the social politics of the School of Music. Basically I've committed social suicide (music school wise) for two reasons: 

a) I'm a music ed. major at the moment. Music ed. majors make up about 15% of the school's population while performance majors make up about 60%. In a nutshell, the performance majors think the ed. majors are a complete joke and they aren't very subtle about it. You wouldn't believe some of the attitudes. Unbelievable. 

b) I was accepted into the Singing Hoosiers ensemble and will probably join. The Singing Hoosiers is open by audition but music and non-music majors alike are allowed to try out (strike one). The repertoire includes (among other things) old popular standards, and showtunes (strike two). Finally, there is a small amount of choreography (strike three). So, to the snobbier sets, Singing Hoosiers is also a joke. As an ed. major I have to be in it at least one semester anyway, but even if that weren't the case, I would probably be interested. I mean, it's the most popular chorus on campus and it's relatively well-known and fun and we get to travel. I mean, they went to Whales and Scotland last year. So forgive me if I think that's kind of cool.

So long story short, I'm a little upset by the snobbery but I think I'll get over it once I find my niche. I've made a lot of very nice non-snobby friends in the school of music so it's by no means everybody. And hey I mean, some of these people are the next Metropolitan Opera singers and Carnegie Hall bound concert pianists so how could they not be snobs. At least they're snobs with the talent to back it up. There's nothing worse than a snob who actually sucks in reality (there are plenty of those here too).


This is one hell of a ranting entry. So even if you didn't read it, leave me a comment so I can still feel connected to my non-Indiana life. It's not even the same time here!

How are you supposed to feel 3 days away from moving halfway across the country? I really don't know. This is all very weird and foreign. I went into the city last night to see my dad in a concert at the Hatch Shell and we were listening to WEEI and there was traffic getting onto Storrow drive and all I could think about was, maybe I'm making a huge mistake. In the back of my mind I've always wanted to go to school in Boston. I probably wouldn't have felt this way if I hadn't gotten that acceptance letter from B.U. AFTER I'd already made up my mind to go to Indiana. I guess it's meant to be. I think just the realization that I'm going to be living in not only a different state but a completely different region ( both geographically and culturally) of the United States has resulted in a new love affair with my home...poor signage, crappy road conditions and ridiculous cost of living aside. I've never been out of Massachusetts for more than three weeks. Now it's going to be three months. There are so many things to miss that I've always taken advantage of. BUT that will make coming home that much more fun. 

I have a million things to do and I've already wasted two hours away with Dawson's Creek. FUCK YOU TBS. Now I need to rush.

"event","Apparently I leave for Indiana in two weeks. This leads me to the inevitable, obligatory seasonal question which is, ""Where the hell did summer go?"" Some of my summer goals were to lose weight (of course), start actually playing my guitar, watch at least 50 of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and keep my room clean. As summer draws to a close I am approximately 5 pounds heavier, my guitar has not been out of its case, I've crossed 3 movies off my list, and my room is a mess. Well, my room is actually pretty nice still but it's gotten messy in the past couple days due to boxes and packing and stuff, so that doesn't really count. The point is, I invest way too much in summer. I do it every year. I expect way too much from it and as a result, it never delivers. I need to give summer a break. So to speak. In other words, will stop making silly summer resolutions in manner of Bridget Jones 


Thirteen days of the season were spent out west with my family. There were some great moments, new states (Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana), and beautiful scenery. The spacious skies, the amber waves of grain- all fantastic. But NOTHING, be it purple mountain's majesty or otherwise, is worth 13 full days with my family. NOTHING. When I got off the plane I half expected to see a parade in my honor and headlines on all the major papers reading ""Courageous local girl spends 13 days with family in middle of nowhere, lives to tell.""


The next couple weeks are so full of things to do...I don't know how I'm going to handle it. Figures that after a whole summer of doing nothing it comes down to two completely packed weeks where I won't even have time to think and then BOOM Indiana. It's probably better this way. Less time to worry and freak out. 

Productivity is fun. Yesterday, for example, was a great day. I practiced piano and voice, registered to vote, purchased a new shower caddy, a bonsai tree, a booklight, and a pair of earrings I've wanted for a long time, made my brother lunch, got a free Frappaccino from Micah Groder at Starbucks, and had a rehearsal with Cathy. AND a really hot guy got the door for me at Barnes and Noble. I love it when guys hold doors. What can I say, I'm easy to please.

Other highlights of the last few days have been hanging out with Chenifer and finding out that boxes are actually quite expensive and driving down to Dartmouth, MA to see Eileen, et al. Good times. Lots of marine life.  


I'm still recovering from all that time with my family. I need a drink. And how."

<lj-cut text=""Adventures In The ER Waiting Room"">
My week in Maine was good barring a big family fight the first day up (It's the Snowden way) and an injury incurred by my father. Things were going smoothly until yesterday when my dad fell down whilst playing catch with my brother and broke his wrist really badly. My brother and I waited in the emergency room for a good three hours. Luckily, we received some entertainment in the form of a young boy named Curtis. Curtis is probably about 11 or 12, short, bespectacled, and pondishly clothed. This is the conversation that ensued when Curtis approached Dan: 

Curtis: What's your name?
Dan: Dan.
Curtis: What kind of music do you like?
Dan: Uh, mostly classical. Classical guitar and stuff. 
Curtis: Do you listen to Korn?
Dan: Uh, not really. I used to. [True Statement]
Curtis: I like Korn. They're my favorite band.

Curtis proceeded to list the Korn CDs he owned and the Korn CDs he hoped to purchase in the future. He also proceeded to play one of the songs for us by blasting his discman. Later, another young man came in with his family. Curtis quickly moved on to speak to him about his musical tastes and piercings. I suppose Dan wasn't displaying the appropriate amount of zest for all things Korn. Around this time, Curtis's younger sister came waltzing over to Curtis and his new friend to tell them she liked Britney Spears and Hillary Duff. She also proclaimed that her pajamas were Mary Kate and Ashley. This girl must be about 6 years old. I imagined Britney Spears writhing around in beads. I imagined Mary Kate Olson's emaciated image on the cover of People. I despaired. 

My reverie was broken when the body of a small boy glided toward me on the floor. Enter youngest brother Ethan who was apparently trying to buff the emergency room floor with his fleece pajamas and some sort of strange backstroke motion. He looked up at me and said: ""What's your name?"" I said: ""I'm Julia, what's your name?"" He said: ""Ethan."" Then he swam away.  Further confusing the situation was the fact that their father was reading some evangelical Christian book. At one point I overheard the little girl say ""Curtis? Who do you believe in?"" ""God."" Curtis quickly replied. The same question was pitched to Ethan who supplied the same answer. It was a little creepy. And that's what I have to say about that.

<lj-cut text=""What Was I Thinking"">

Ever since they asked us to share our most embarrassing moment at Orientation, I've been trying to figure out what mine is. The fact that one particular moment does not surface right away leads me to believe that I do not have one particular ""most embarrassing moment."" I've been scouring the archives of my brain and I've come up with a series of episodes rather than moments. Not included is any embarrassing moment involving menstruation (Everyone- that is, everyone who menstruates- has at least one), anything involving embarrassing behavior on the part of my parents, and some previously embarrassing moments (i.e. the infamous stuck in the bathroom story, the time I lied to my first grade teacher about my mom being pregnant, or the time I picked my nose and got caught trying to wipe it on the Hannoosh's refrigerator. Hey, I was like, 5) that are no longer relevant as I am no longer embarrassed by them. The episodes that follow do not count as ""embarrassing moments"" as many of them are only embarrassing in retrospect and are considerably longer than a single moment. Instead, I have deemed them the top five what-the-fuck-was-I-thinking moments:

5) The baggy, green, wide-wale corduroy/velour pants I wore almost everyday in fifth grade.   
4) The way I was wearing my hair when I got my license picture taken. I look like a dog with long shaggy ears. 
3) Agreeing to ""go out"" with Terry Ashworth, the orange foundation, the carpenter pants, the short-lived obligatory crush on Kyle What's-his-name...i.e. ALL of 7th grade.
2) A story called ""...and then my dad stepped in my puke"" or ""What happens when you drink too much Bacardi Razz"" Nothing good has ever come of Bacardi Razz. You could make the argument that nothing good has ever come of alcohol, but the jury is still out on that one. Hey I mean, if it weren't for alcohol I never would have done karaoke or declared my love for Scot Wilks...oh, right...
1) The youth rally I planned with Lee entitled ""Light the fire of Jesus!"" Oh man. Enough said.

<lj-cut text=""My Phone's On Vibrate For You"">

I hate that feeling of falling into a never-ending routine. Summer makes me feel like doing crazy things and meeting people and doing something different every night but somehow it always ends up being the same pattern of Newburyport, Dunkin Donuts, drive around, Newburyport, Dunkin Donuts, drive around, Newburyport, Dunkin Donuts, drive around ad infinitum. Here's my cell phone number: 978 270 3949. If you're reading this and we've never hung out and you think maybe you'd like to OR we have hung out but we just don't do it enough, call me. I'm dead serious. Do it. Don't even think twice about it, just call. I can be kinda cool, I promise. I have dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and I love long walks on the beach. Just kidding. Well kind of kidding, I mean, technically all those things are true. But seriously, call me. YOU! NOW!

</lj-cut>

Update: 5 hours later. 

My cell phone broke in half. This is not a joke. The screen is disconnected from the body of the phone. It is beyond repair. I thought I should alert the public to this situation as I'm sure so many of you were planning to call me after that inspiring post. This feels like a sign but I don't know what it could mean. Give up on life? Sever all ties? Stop trying to communicate with the outside world and devote my life to Buddhism? Get a new phone? 

I'll go with the latter."

"event","So now that June is over, I am at liberty to return to livejournal. My attempt at no aim/livejournal/television for a month failed miserably. Oh well. At least it was a learning experience. I learned that I am actually MORE pitiful than I thought I was. 


I went out to Indiana for orientation last week. It was fun but also stressful and annoying as orientation generally is. ""Everybody take some M&Ms! Red means you have to tell your most embarrassing story, yellow is why you chose IU, green is your favorite song, blue is what animal you would be and why, blah, blah..."" Good times. Nobody should have to go through that shit twice in a lifetime. One girl's most embarrassing story was overdosing on sleeping pills in Japan...oh man, music majors. 

I met one kid from Massachusetts, three kids from O.C., CA (they swear it's nothing like the show), two kids with real strong accents from Tennessee and a variety of others from all over the place. New England was quite under-represented. It was just me and trombone major Matt from Springfield. Unfortunately I met mostly freshman. I didn't even notice at first because I mean, a year isn't exactly a huge age difference, but when they got WICKED EXCITED about staying up all night in the ""dorm"" and playing ""ultimate frisbee"" on the ""quad"" it became slightly more obvious. I opted for my mom's hotel room. 

I came away from Orientation with a variety of things:
- A disgustingly large array of Indiana University emblazoned products, i.e. shirts, pants, car stickers, key chains, etc.
- Approximately 760,320,000 pamphlets, booklets, and newsletters. 
- The knowledge that people in other parts of the United States really do listen to Country music. I mean, people who are otherwise hip and Gap-clad. 


On Saturday my mom took a plane back home and Andrew came up from Louisville. We hung out in Bloomington for awhile and I showed him around campus and then we drove back to Kentucky for even more adventures like minor league baseball and horse races. The highlight of the baseball game was ""Special guests the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Cheerleaders and their mascot...CAPTAIN FEAR."" Sorry Captain Fear, but you're not that scary. I lost some money at Churchill Downs but it was still fun. I even got a commemorative Kentucky Derby glass. 

I flew back on Monday by myself. I've never flown alone before. Turns out it's not that exciting. Well, that's not entirely true. I had some adventures...like sitting next to the obligatory old fat guy on one of the flights. We had a nice chat about the weather. I also had a good time with one of the security guys who gave me a hard time because he saw a tuning fork on the x-ray machine but then couldn't find it when he searched my bag. Eventually I directed him to the little pocket which held said fork. The icing on the cake was the adventure that awaited me at home in my suitcase (which I had checked, not carried on). When I opened it up there was a little notice saying that they had searched my bag by hand. This didn't bother me until I found a bunch of Domino's sugar packets in one of the inside pockets. I toyed with the idea that somebody had very creatively planted cocaine but upon tasting the substance I determined that it was indeed sugar. Taking a taste was probably a risk but curiosity demanded it. Of course this begs the question, why the fuck were there sugar packets in my suitcase? The world may never know."

Low carb Ben & Jerry's?? It's fucking ice cream. It's SUPPOSED to be bad for you. What's next, low-carb lip gloss? Low-carb toothpaste?</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Curvy Rant"">And what's this about Britney Spears being fat? So now you're fat if you're not fucking wasting away. If Britney spears is fat than I'm screwed. I might as well give the fuck up and eat myself into a 500 lb. oblivion. It's scary really, when you think about it. I mean, if I'm walking down your average street on your average day, I'm pretty sure people aren't looking at me and saying ""Wow, look at the fat girl"" but if you put me in a movie or on T.V. I'd be like, the new fucking ""curvy"" role model and I'd be forced to go on talk shows and discuss how proud I am to be ""curvy"" and Oprah would say some bullshit about the changing face of hollywood and nobody would give a shit about anything I actually did and everyone would clap and cheer and say ""Good for her!"" but they'd all be thinking, she's fucking fat and why doesn't she just lose some weight and they'd go right back to worshiping all the fucking size 0 perfect skin perfect hair millionaires who nobody can compete with. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""Stupid Ass Girls Rant"">What pisses me off most is all the stupid ass girls who buy into all the shit. What's so fucking great about looking perfect all the fucking time. I used to get angry that there were those girls in high school who showed up everyday looking perfect and how the hell do they do it and blah blah blah. Well I know how they do it. It's ALL THEY FUCKING CARE ABOUT. Now why does this bother me, you might ask? The truth is I am afraid. I am afraid that if enough girls spend all their energy trying to look perfect and basically succeed, men will come to expect this and I will be screwed because whether it's excess flab or zits or whatever, I will always be physically flawed in some major or minor way. 

I really hate girls sometimes. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Politics Rant"">Another thing that pisses me off: Politics. I give up on trying to have political opinions. Watching Pat Boone on the 700 Club makes me want to be intensely left-wing. Then morons like Michael Moore make me want to be a radical right-winger. I give up. I hate everyone. I hate them all. I hate Bush, I hate Kerry, I hate the Herald, I hate the Globe and I basically hate anyone with any strong political leanings. I mean give me a break, all politicians are full of shit. Just because someone belongs to a certain party doesn't mean they're going to be a fucking hero and save the fucking country from whatever fucking threat you think is out there, be it internal (like fear of Bible bangers) or external (fear of terrorists). Give up. Everytime I hear someone I know talk about politics it just sounds like they're spewing off shit they've heard from other people be it parents or significant others or George Bush or Dave Matthews... It makes me feel like Holden Caulfield and I just want to call them all phonies and tell them to shut the hell up. I'm the same way, I know that. All I do is spew off things I've heard other people say. I can't deny that. It's the nature of the beast. I'm beginning to think it's impossible to form your own true opinions.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Rant Rant""> And the thing that pisses me off above all else is the fact that I'm so pissed off. I'm tired of being the angry one all the time. Tell me how so many of you just let things roll off? How the hell do you do that? How the hell do you sit there and not get angry when things are so blatantly irritating?</lj-cut>

I went to the doctor yesterday and hopefully whatever asshole germ is in my system will be out soon thanks to the antibiotics she prescribed. Apparently this one bug is responsible for the nausea, vomiting, headache, runny nose, cough, and conjunctivitis- all of which I have experienced over the course of the week. Good times. 


So, as I am confined to my house with my very contagious pink-eye and general goupiness, I have been enjoying such activities as napping, napping, reading, napping, eating, napping, reading, napping, and napping. I have yet to be able to sleep through an entire night...probably because of all the napping. So that kinda sucks. I also finished Book 5 of Harry Potter today so I just don't know what to do with myself. You can only watch Love Actually so many times. The kid in the octopus costume has gotten a little less funny. That has to be a bad sign. 


I very much enjoyed the thunderstorm last night. I've never seen so much lightening. I'm pretty glad the weather had been so crappy. Being stuck in the house would suck a lot more if it was nice outside. 

Cool, my lip is bleeding. 

Anyway, I'll probably be updating a lot this week to make up for the fact that I will be absent from livejournal for the month of June.

On Tuesday night we went to the Page School playground to go on the swings. That is, after we went to Bickford's (where beer and wine is now served by the way). Anyway, swings are really good times, I have to say. I think I even dreamed about swinging last night. I dreamed about a lot of weird things last night. Including professor Dumbledore (of Harry Potter fame), eating chicken quesadillas with Jenny Hills, and hearing Guster perform on some sort of flying carriage thing. I was trying to sing along to homecoming king but I kept getting the words wrong. And when I put my glasses on to see better it looked like I was watching them on TV instead of live. At one point in the dream I was making out with some guy on a bunk bed but I couldn't enjoy it (even though he was really hot) because I kept worrying that he was going to notice my hair was dirty. Who knows.

"event","I'm thinking about subtracting television and Internet from my life for a period just to see what happens. Maybe like a month or something. The only exception would be checking my email occasionally because sometimes it's important...but no livejournal, no TV, and no AIM. Especially no AIM. It pisses me off. I don't like that so much of my social interaction is electronic. 


Yes, instant messaging is convenient and makes keeping in touch very easy. I ask you this though, should it be so easy? It almost seems unnatural. One of my favorite aspects of instant messaging used to be the fact that it took away a certain level of awkwardness that could potentially exist if you were talking in person. I mean, it's easy to talk online to someone you might ordinarily feel kind of uncomfortable starting up a conversation with or also it's easier to approach someone with something online instead of starting a conflict in person. I've now come to the conclusion that this is actually a drawback. I think it's important to experience awkwardness from time to time and it's definitely better to start/resolve any conflicts in person, one reason being the fact that you can never tell what someone really means through instant messaging. 


Plus, it robs us of the experience of catching up on life events and such in person. I mean, when you finally physically hang out with someone you may not have seen in months you have nothing to say because you've said it all ""online"" or ""read it in livejournal."" That's the worst- when someone says, ""Oh, did I tell you _______!"" And you have to say ""No, but I read it in your livejournal."" Talk about a conversation killer. 


Then there's the trap that I often fall into which is taking it personally when someone mysteriously signs off in the middle of a conversation or just stops responding OR when you're online for awhile and nobody ims you. It's so middle school of me to care. If ever there was something stupid to take to heart, it would be that. 


I think my reasons for wanting to go without television need no explanation. Biggest waste of time ever. (Not that I don't enjoy it like everyone else, but you have to agree that it is a waste of time.)

Meredith's birthday surprise extravaganza (as I like to call it) was a lot of fun. The highlight for me was getting the laser show guy to put ""Happy Birthday Meredith"" up on the planetarium thing. When I told my dad about that part he said ""You realize you guys are huge geeks, right?"" He's really not wrong, but I'm ok with it. 

I think it turns out I'm a pretty good liar. This is a strange talent for me to possess because I basically never lie. (Barring the obvious girl things like, ""No, you look really cute!"" I am guilty of my fair share of those.) I'm not saying it righteously or anything. In fact, I'm beginning to think it's not necessarily a good thing. Most of the time I overshare. Like when I felt like shit after throwing up a lot of rum on the back streets of West Newbury and when my mom asked what was wrong I actually told her the whole story. That's not NORMAL. I should lie more.



I can't wait for the semester to be over so I can just focus on getting things together and organized for Indiana.

Anyway, it was too cold to wear nothing else so I made some additions to my outfit. The final result was red-ish/pink velor pants and a seafoam green bleach stained sweatshirt.

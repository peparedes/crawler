As for me, I'm not writing, not producing the amount of tangible work I should be.  I'm frustrated, depressed, angry, irritated.  What else is new?  It's killing my creativity.  Shelly suggested meditation, someone else suggested I go back to get my head examined.  I'm leaning more toward the meditation method.  Yeah, me, the hyper one, meditating.  I can make it work.  I need to make it work.  So you know what?  No more whining.  I probably won't be posting here again for a long, long time, so please don't think I've disappeared or anything.  I'll still read to catch up with everyone I don't talk to or hear from on a regular basis.  Chris, I'll e-mail you more reading material as soon as I have something I'm happy with.  Just be warned...it could take a few years for that to happen.  =)"

"event","It's been a while.  No excuses, no apologies.  It's just been a while.  I haven't been doing a whole helluva lot, just hanging out, hanging in with my buds and trying to do some writing.  I've got writer's block the size of the Great Wall of China and I'm ready to cry or bang my head against the wall or SOMETHING.  Hanging around with Aimee helps.  She is called the Muse and it's a very accurate description.  She does something to my brain that does produce some creativity.  I'm still trying to figure out how to write a cover letter so I can apply for a better job.  Dow Jones is hiring writers and Vassar College is looking for a sports information director.  I'd love for a shot at either position, but they require cover letters and honestly, I think that's what been keeping me from getting interviews, my lack of one.  Aside from my usual complaints, I took a bit of a trip down memory lane tonight.  I was on my way home from hanging out with Rich, Aimee and Rose and I happened to turn on the radio.  I caught the tail end of Stairway to Heaven and it made me sad.  When I was in high school, I had this friend, Christina.  She was the only person who didn't make me feel like shit.  She treated me like I was a person and she was my best friend.  We went to the shore a lot the summer before our senior year and the summer following graduation.  When we first got our licenses, she had this old Cavalier that was definitely falling apart.  But it had a sun roof and a decent radio.  We'd listen to Tool or Nine Inch Nails on the way down to the shore, but at night, when the air was cooler and maybe just a bit damp feeling, we'd listen to Hendrix, Joplin, Floyd and Zeplin.  Stairway to Heaven always sticks in my mind because it was her favorite.  Tonight, driving my own car down 29 in West Trenton, with cool, damp air coming into my windows, I was back in the passenger seat of her car for a few seconds.  I was 17 again, feeling a little sunburnt and smelling like sun block.  I could even smell the air freshner she had then.  We were both full of what we were going to do with our futures.  As for me, we know what my future held.  As for her, she has a few warrants out for her arrest for failure to appear in court for DWI and drug charges.  Last I heard, she had gotten married in Arizona.  Things had turned out very differently than we had hoped, but I guess that's how it goes.  I have made excellent friends.  I have put down building blocks for what could be a good future as long as I don't fuck it up somehow or my writer's block doesn't go away.  There are times, like tonight, when I wonder where she is and what's she's doing, what her life is like.  I wonder if she thinks of me and remembers the same things I do.  It sounds stupid, but I miss her.  We all seem to have one friend (or two) at some point in our lives whom we love to death, but could be the death of us.  She was that friend for me.  She nearly got me arrested for underage drinking.  She nearly killed me in a high speed car crash on more than a few occasions.  But I still remember this grin she'd get and how it'd make my stomach knot in fear because it meant we were heading off on another adventure.  She encouraged me to be more daring, to leave certain hang-ups behind, to losen up and most importantly, to say 'fuck it'.  I am a much different person now at 26 than I was at 17 and I guess in a way she was responsible.  I wish I could show her that I was listening."

"event","Writer's block sucks.  Not only can I not write anything tangible or anything that doesn't come out like a complete piece of shit, but my imagination is running wild.  I have so many characters screaming in my brain and I can't give any of them a voice.  Yes, scary, but no, I'm not losing my mind.  Not yet, anyway.  I've just been flat out aggrivated (thank you, E, for that little episode before I went on vacation.  THANK YOU VERY FUCKING MUCH!)and when I'm like this, I can't write.  This is so fucking crazy.  I used to be able to write in a pressure cooker-like environment.  Now if something upsets me, that's it.  It takes forever to get me writing again.  Getting out of the newsroom was the best thing for me.  I was burning out at 26 and that's just flat out sad.  It's helped my creativity grow by leaps and bounds and I've just been better for it.  So that 'little' issue I had at work a few weekends ago has really eaten at me and now I can't write.  I'm ready to pound my head against the wall.  I once said to my mom that it's weird to know that someday you'll be a success, doing the things you love to do.  It's getting there that's the excruciating part."

"event","Yeah, it's been a while.  I have to say I haven't been all that inspired to write ANYTHING.  Not a whole helluva lot going on in the world of Jen.  I get up, putz around the house, go to work.  Come home, putz around and go to bed.  Repeat, five times a week.  I had my vacation.  I relaxed, got back in touch with my sanity and regained some of my patience.  I came back from vacation and slid back into the groove of things.  I talked to Melissa about my issues from last weekend and I feel so much better now.  I feel bad because I started yelling, but she assured me it was all right because I wasn't yelling at her, just yelling in general.  I didn't realize I was still that pissed off.  I think I should go back to therapy, to work on my anger issues.  I internalize too much of it and it's probably going to eat me alive at some point, which is no good.  Let's see...Gracie, my aunt's dog, had five puppies.  There were six, but one died two days after being born.  Two of them are huge and they're only like two weeks old.  They're about the length of my forearm, wrist to elbow.  My aunt calls one Godzilla and I call the other one Dot because she's got a black dot square in the middle of her white head. They are absolutely adorable and I can't keep any of them because Ceili.  The thought of keeping one never really crossed my mind.  Ceili's 10 now and she's been the queen of the roost for 10 years.  She hates other animals and it's not fair to spring a puppy on her and make her remaining years miserable for her.  Shakes, my aunt's other dog, is an 80-pound Shepard/Lab mix.  He's HUGE and he's scared to death of Ceili because she bit him when he was a puppy.  I've joined my friend Aimee's RPG as two characters from Alias.  That's about all the creativity I've been able to muster.  I looked over pieces of Drive and found some editing I could start doing, but I've been too fucking lazy.  I don't know if it's writer's block that's hurting me or if I'm just being flat out lazy.  I think it's a little of both.  Well, I've been boring enough.  Elvis is leaving the building."

"event","So today wasn't so bad.  Work went by slowly, but then again, business moved at the pace of a snail.  We were done and out by 5:10.  I got to start my vacation 20 minutes early.  I still need to go back to the store and discuss my little issue from yesterday with Melissa.  Not so much as a tattle tale, but to let her know my side because I know she'll hear about it from the other side and if she doesn't hear it directly from that person, she'll hear somehow.  After my shitty ass day yesterday, I checked my e-mail and I found my first freelance writing assignment.  It's for a new lesbian magazine starting up in Atlanta called Judy.  They want me to write a story about how lesbian women have helped sustain women's athletics through the years.  I'm psyched.  It's right up my alley.  Right now, I'm just hot, tired and sticky from sweating.  It feels nice outside, but inside, it's all sticky and stuff.  I have to get up early tomorrow to take my car in for a new oxygen sensor, which I've been putting off for ages.  I also need an oil change, so tomorrow should run me about $200.  I know I need other stuff done, like new fan belts, new brakes, etc., but that's just going to have to wait til I have money.  I still need to call Sallie Mae about not being able to make my payment this month (hmmm...car repairs or student loan payment?) and to see if they can lower my monthly payment.  What I pay them a month is taking more than half my paycheck.  The other paycheck I get each month pays my car insurance, cell phone bill and my smaller student loan that I have through the government.  My plan is this: When I get a better job, pay off the smaller government loan and then really concentrate on taking a huge chunk out of what I owe Sallie Mae.  I need to get this damned monkey off my back so I can buy myself a nice car and get out on my own.  We'll just have to see what the employment fairy will have for me this week."

I have a rotten, shitty day.  I should have known how today would go when my cereal bowl, with my last packet of instant cream of wheat in it, exploded all over my kitchen table.  I was thisclose to calling Melissa and telling her to come get my keys from me at work.  I've had it.  I'm so frustrated with my job it's not even funny.  I think what makes it worse is that aside from the attitude I get from certain people I work with, where I am employmentwise is so far from where I wanted to be.  I do not want to do my job anymore.  I do not want to sell one more table, one more paperweight, one more fake plant.  I do not want to have to listen to Elisa run her mouth to me or about me anymore.  I have more than fucking had it.  If ya'all are into it, pray to the employment gods and put in a good word for me.  I could really use it.  In better news, a mag based in Atlanta wants me to write a story on lesbians and sports.  It's so right up my alley.  And my vacation starts at 5:30 tomorrow night.  No Bombay for six days.  Six whole days of not having to put up with ANYONE'S shit.  I'm more than ready for it."

I hate getting sick because I can't take the time I need to get rested and get better.  So I'm going to keep Kleenex in business (almost single handidly), take some Tylenol cold, keep hand sanitizer in my apron pocket, drink lots of OJ and eat lots of chicken noodle soup.  Cool thing is, I'm on vacation in two weeks.  Bad thing is I can't afford to do shit.  Good thing is that it'll force me to stay home and do things I need to do, like clean my car (inside and out), give the dog a bath, get some writing done and find myself a better paying job so that I can afford to take a proper vacation at some point.  $9 an hour at 36 hours a week isn't really all that lucrative.  My parents are talking about going to Ireland next year and I really want to go.  Well, I need to get some sleep.  My nose is running almost non-stop and I just feel like crap.

I haven't been drinking as much water on the job as I was used to when I worked for the Ledger when we had a water cooler in the corner.  I have to say, we have a water fountain in the stock room and the water that comes out tastes like shit, to be nice, so I don't drink it.

I've still got the sinus pain, but now I've got nausea and I ended up puking on the train ride home.  I looked at myself in the mirror this morning and both eyes are very puffy and I've got these red flecks or dots all over my face.  They're especially centered around my eyes and I think I may have broken blood vessels or something when I was throwing up.  I feel like I have to again, but I don't want to.  I called in to work to go in an hour later than I'm supposed to and I'm praying for a slow night, so I can sit in the back with my head between my knees.

I'm hoping it's the second and that it'll pass relatively soon because I've got some great plans this weekend for my mom's birthday.  We'll just have to see.  I'm so bummed I had to leave Sleater-Kinney, but I felt so bad I was afraid to stay.  I only got to see them for a short while and only got to hear a few songs, so I'm kinda bummed about that.  But what can you do?  Everyone would have thought I was very drunk and puking, but I wasn't.  I did drink, before the show, but not nearly enough to make me as sick as I was and make me feel the way I do right now."

"event","There was this song that came out my freshman year of college or so and it was called Superhero by Garrison Starr.  Nothing really deep about it, but it was a cute song and it recalled being young, when you believed you could do anything.  You believed that you were unstoppable, immortal, that you could vanquish evils by turning on the bed room light and make bad things disappear by wishing them away.  You could pretend (and believe) that just by tying a bed sheet around your neck, you could protect the world from evil doers everywhere.  I believed it.  The park behind my house and the various playground equipment were just springboards for my imagination.  The sky literally was the limit for me, my imagination rife with images I got from the hundreds of books I read as a kid.  For some reason, I thought of Superhero tonight while looking for a vase at work and when I came home, read about Garrison Starr in the Gloss Report.  I once met her at Lilith Fair and did an interview that I had hoped to turn into an article.  However, I lost the notes.  Garrison was quite gracious to give an interview to someone who didn't have media credentials for the event.  She was very polite and very nice to me and my friend as we sat and talked to her for a while.  Some days, I think back on my youth and I kind of wish for that innocence back.  I still have the imagination, but it has been changed by the things I've seen and done in my life. In some ways, it has been almost perverted by the atrocities I witness every time I turn on the damned news.  I don't regret losing the innocence I had because it would be senseless to mourn such a great period of my life.  I'm older, I'm wiser and I'm battle scarred, but I'm here, dammit (to kinda quote the Color Purple, one of my all time fave books and movies).  I'm grateful I had it at one point and that I can still draw from it, that I can still remember what it felt like to lay on my back in a field on a summer day and pick shapes out of clouds.  I can still remember the thrill in my stomach of going on the biggest, baddest roller coaster in the amusement park and the feel of sand beneath my feet as I chased a frisbee on the beach.  I'm really tired and I guess that's why this entry has rambled so long.  Time for bed!  Maybe I'll dream of flying and rescuing Lois Lane."

Actually, I don't think I've ever had a boss before that I truly liked.  She listens when people complain and tries to remedy the issue.  She listens when you tell her about something that's not working out and she'll pull you aside and talk to you if you're doing something wrong.  I don't think I've heard her raise her voice once in anger to an employee.  She's gotten clipped, but never yelled.  She doesn't harass you to get things done or annoy the hell out of you by breathing down your neck.  She does everything she can to be flexible about the schedule and she'll bend over backwards to make sure you get the time off you've requested.  It's great.  In a way, I'm kinda dreading getting a better paying job, but at the same time, I know I need one and I know I'll be much better off in a position closer to my field."

Five pallets and four beds, which is nothing.  Melissa and I were talking about a 500-piece shipment we got one day in preparation for Christmas.  It was all replenishment stock and ornaments and we both pulled a 12-hour day to get it all inside.  I'm glad that's behind me and I'll gladly take a nice, easy day like I had today."

I haven't felt this positive in a long time.  I just hope I don't end up sabotaging myself somehow, like by being lazy or something.  Or falling into the traps I've fallen into before.  If it happens, I will have no one to blame but myself.  I think I'll be okay this time.  I'm gradually taking the steps necessary to getting my ass a real writing career.

The weather's gotten absolutely beautiful, work wasn't too bad today (despite the fact I was stuck inside instead of being able to enjoy the weather).  Tomorrow, I'm probably going to clean out my car.  It needs it- windows, interior, dash, etc.  I'm telling you, the life of Jen doesn't get much more exciting than this.  I'm thinking about doing some writing, since I haven't done much in the last week or so.  But you know what?  I'm not stressing over it.  It'll come, eventually.  If I force it, I'm screwing myself.  I've gotten a little more optimistic as the days get warmer and I feel almost relieved by that fact.  I've gotten myself out of my rut because I've been able to put into perspective what put me in that rut- losing my job with the Ledger.  It wasn't a lack of talent (at least I hope not), it was a production issue.  I wasn't there to produce because I had to seek a full-time job, therefore they've moved on to the next person and forgotten about what I used to produce.  Their fucking loss.  I'm on this huge self-improvement kick and the first part is getting my writing career going in ernest.  That in turn will lead to more financial freedom (I'm praying) and independence, when I can finally move out.  The second part is losing weight and getting back into shape.  I'm not too down on myself about my appearance, though I'd like to look like I did when I was in HS.  I won't get back down to 130 pounds and I'm okay with that.  I'll be happy getting below 200.  I'm working on phasing out the bad so I can continue with the new.  I have to make the changes or I will never be truly happy and dammit, I deserve to be.  I've worked way too damned hard and come too far to get back into that rut I was in a few months ago.  My motivation for all of this is simple: I cannot fail.  I will not fail."

Turns out only three people read and Liz was sandwiched between two great poets.  She did an excellent job with her short story and I can't wait to see the end product.  As far as readings go, I'm booked again for May 20th.  I need to get something published finally.  When I read last month at the re-opening of Girlsalon, I felt like a slouch because all of the other writers who read have been published and were fairly well known in NY.  Only one way to change that: finish Drive.  Get moving on Untouchable and finish up some short stories I've got bumping around in my head.  One is about my misadventures in retail and there is quite a bit of material to fill that one.  We have some real freaks come into the store and buy stuff.  Speaking of work, it's like 12:20 and I have yet to shower or eat anything.  Part of the reason I didn't shower yet is because my bra is in the dryer.  I don't leave the house without my industrial strength boulder holder...I'd kill someone, namely myself, if I did.  My knee is still pretty cranky.  I think I really tweaked something doing shipment on Mon. and going down steps or up and down ladders is a painful experience.  I'm still awaiting word on whether or not I'm going to be writing for a magazine in Ga.  I'm a bit nervous, but then again, I'm high strung when it comes to writing.  We all know that.  There's going to be this writer's thing in NY on June 12th and I'm thinking of signing up for two of the seminars, one on agents and one is a masters' class in fiction writing.  I'm curious to see what, if anything, I'm doing wrong with my work.  So I have to get the registration form printed and mailed out with a check for $100, which I can amazingly afford at this point in time.  I'm thrilled to death about that.  Well, I suppose I should go eat something and check the status of the boulder holder."

We're supposed to have wind chills close to the teens on Mon.  I think someone screwed up here.  Anyways...haven't been up to a whole helluva lot.  Work was relatively quiet tonight, which didn't suprise me much because of the weather.  The Easter Bunny is currently at the mall (and at the other mall up the road) and ours is kinda creepy looking.  He's orange.  Every Easter Bunny I've ever seen is white.  He actually waved at me tonight and I just kinda kept on going.  Hope I didn't know whoever was in the suit, but the costume just gave me an inexplicable case of the creeps.  When I was little, I never had issues with climbing onto Santa's or the Bunny's lap.  Now, I nearly render Mrs. Claus unconscious with one of the store's double doors (you'll just have to ask about that little early morning incident- it SO wasn't my fault) and I run from the Easter Bunny.  Maybe old timer's is setting in, as Melissa stated yesterday.  Oh, well.  Could be worse.  I could be hallucinating.  I've been debating ways I can kinda network my way into freelance writing and I can't really come up with a concrete game plan.  Maybe I should stop being the dork in the corner downing beers like a thirsty person downs water.  Maybe I should actually get off my fat Irish ass and go talk to people.  I definitely need to start attending more readings, but NY is an expensive venture, so I need to be selective.  I'm thinking about submitting part of Drive to a contest that accepts partially completed manuscripts.  I need to do a shitload of clean up work on what I want to send in, so perhaps I should bust out my trust little Writer's Market book and check out the deadline on that puppy so I don't miss it.  I need to get just a little more active in the writing department as far as promoting myself and finding ways to get my book published when the damned thing is finally finished.  Before I end this, here's some words to think about.  It's from a Nelly Furtado song called Powerless(so I've got a guilty pleasure with Top 40 pop music- shoot me).  It goes, ""Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 
So say what you want

"event","Yeesh...car insurance is now an hour late and I'm sweating All State is going to cancel my coverage.  No insurance in NJ is a very, VERY bad thing.  Where the hell is my paycheck????!!!!  Leave it to me to work for a company, get direct deposit with said company and they're in fucking TEXAS which is three hours behind us!  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  Okay...feel better now.  Hopefully, I won't lose my coverage.  Hopefully, they'll just smack me with an annoying surcharge, which I'll deal with.  Some day- you know, when I get that nice lucrative job or something like that- I'll be able to just pay off my insurance in one shot instead of paying monthly.  Same goes for student loans.  That is one gorilla on my back I'd be happy as hell to unload as soon as possible.  Lottery winnings, anyone?  Work is work.  I was talking to Melissa today at work about annoying customers and how to deal with them.  Last night, I had some old dude come into the store and just be a rude ass.  He informed me that we're not on the mall directory (shocker!  I've known that since we opened in July and we're still NOT on the directory) and he rudely informed me he nearly left the mall.  The words, ""then why didn't you do me the favor?"" were right on the tip of my tongue, but I behaved myself.  Remembered that Disney customer service training I had to suffer through.  Melissa told us about a customer (who placed a rather large order, but was a total dick to all staff) who came in on Sun. and asked for the guy he originally dealt with.  When informed that said dude was off for the day, the asshole told the girl, ""then I guess you'll have to suffice.  Come with me right now"".  This came AFTER he called her ""hey you"".  Then we got into a discussion about that particular female's incident involving torn pants while climbing a ladder in the middle of the sales floor.  After she ripped her pants (up near her butt), she came into the stock room and was trying to take a look at the damage.  She looked at me, shook her head and said, ""Damn.  I just showed a store full of people my ashy ass.""  She had to help me up off the floor after I stopped laughing.  See, we really do work well together.  We're a bit goofy, but you have to have a lighter side in order to keep your sanity in retail.  Some days, you want to punch customers square in the nuts (see journal entry detailing a customer request that I call the ENTIRE company for an item) and others you want to give them every discount, coupon, etc. you can get a hold of because they're nice and they made that little part of your day just a little bit better.  I've always been taught that it's the nice and the nasty that you remember most.  You lose what's in between.  That's very true.  Now, if we could only get some customers to take some heavy duty ludes...."

"event","I'm so tired and brain dead right now it's not even funny.  Apparently, I'm not that brain dead if I'm writing.  Hmmm...anyways.  I just wrote a story about breasts for my friend Mick, who runs her own zine.  I occasionally contribute articles.  In it, I mentioned evolution and my mind meandered, as it does when I'm tired (even when I'm not tired, dammit) and I thought about the evolution of my life.  I never had things easy, from making friends to being an athlete.  I was a social pariah in high school and my peers had no problems letting me know that.  They did a lot of damage and those scars are still visible to this day in certain things I do and say, the way I react to things.  But maybe me being an athlete is a perfect example for what I want to say.  For those who know me, love me, hold me dear, you know I'm as graceful as a rabid rhino in a tutu.  I have no natural athleticism or grace.  I had to teach my body, my reflexes, how to be an athlete, how to stop a speeding soccer ball that was barreling straight for my face and how to grind my heel into some girl's foot when she got on my nerves.  I taught myself those things to compete and that competition was cathartic for me in a way.  Maybe that's why I loved journalism so much.  Not only was I doing what I loved as a job, but I was competing for stories, for interviews, for leads, for scoops.  Sometimes, I came out on top and grabbed what I needed.  Sometimes, I came in as an also ran and that just urged me to work harder, fight more.  When I finished college and left the Ledger, my life kinda fell into a rut.  At some point, I lost a lot of faith, in myself and in my work.  I didn't feel the competitiveness anymore and I felt worthless.  But over time, I began to realize things about myself.  I began to find things I thought I had left far behind me and how to use them to my advantage now.  I once said I wrote to silence the voices in my head, the voices of my peers that said I would fail and never become a writer because I wanted it so bad.  As I wrote, those voices fell silent.  I've silenced them for so long now that they're no longer there and it kind of threw me a bit.  What was I going to have as motivation?  I realized the other day through a conversation with my mom that it's time to let the past go and move on.  I can't let those traumas and scars define who I am or mold my future anymore.  I have done it for far too long to let it continue and it stops now.  I have worked hard to let the pain go and I can walk away now without fearing what will follow me.  Melissa, my manager, and I were talking about relationships the other day and she said this, ""How can you find someone to be your mate when you haven't even really found yourself yet?""  What I want more than anything is to be a writer.  It has been my lifelong dream and that is the one thing about me that defines me.  Writing is no easy job and not for the faint of heart.  It is a profession that requires absolute dedication, diligence, patience and that you be a true believer.  I believe I have finally begun to find Jen Gaynor and I'm beginning to like being her.  I don't feel embarassed as much anymore when I tell people I still live at home nor when I tell them that I sell furniture.  In reality, I can't afford to live on my own and I do have a job, even if it doesn't pay all that much.  I earn my own money, pay my bills myself and I'm okay with that.  Am I happy with that?  Hell no.  I want to be on my own, pay my bills with no problem and have some left over to put in the bank.  Some day, I'll get it.  Some day, I'll be doing what I want and selling furniture will be one more item on my resume.  What I have to do is work for that some day.  I will no longer feel guilty for wanting more and I will no longer feel guilt for putting myself first in certain situations.  On that note, I'm going to quote Evanescence, who I've been listening to in abundance lately: ""I know I can stop the pain if I will it all away...I'm frightened by what I see, but somehow I know there's much more to come."""

I went up to Frenchtown yesterday with my mom and she got this great, old blanket chest she's planning on using for a coffee table once our living room is re-furbished.  It's easily 100 years old.  It was found at an estate somewhere in upstate NY.  I had a great time with my mom and thoroughly enjoyed going in and out of the antique shops in Frenchtown and Stockton.  I even encountered a not so nice ghost in one of the shops and I booked for the front door.  My mom even commented on how cold a particular part of the store was.  It's a hike and a half up to Frenchtown from here and we did a lot of talking about different things, in particular things to do with my life (relationships, my writing, employment) and it was a productive conversation.  My mom gives great insight and excellent advice.  It's like I have the pieces of a puzzle and I'm not too sure where they go.  She kind of helps me turn them this way and that until they fit into place.  I feel much better about things- a lot more optimistic- than I have in a long time.  I've come to realize a few things about myself and how things are in my life right now in the past couple of days and I can live with it.  Some of my revelations have made things clearer for me and clarity is something I've been missing.  I'm also feeling better about my abilities as a writer and I think I'm beginning to develop just a bit more confidence in what I can do and how good I can do it.  I need to let certain things go in my life and I'm prepared to do that.  They're things I don't need or things that are complicating my life.

It was a horrible day and in the three years since, the memories have not faded in the least for me.  For a while, I could go without thinking about it or remembering some of the horrific images I saw that day on TV.  Now, in a few recent conversations I've had with various people, the 9/11 panel inqueries on the news and Bush's denials, it has all come back.  I think I may be one of the only writers or musicians from the NY/NJ area that didn't write about its impact on me or those around me.  It's just too damned painful and sickening to me for me to actually write something about it.  I guess I'm doing that now.  I was in Florida when it happened, interning in the Happiest Place on Earth.  One of my roommates got me out of bed, telling me I had to get up and that my mom didn't want me to go to work.  I watched, half awake, as the Twin Towers smoked and as I said, ""I have a friend who works there"", witnessed the collapse of the south tower.  I wanted to go back to bed, to wake up from that nightmare and have everything be fine.  I never made it back to my bedroom.  Prior to Jan. of 2002, I had never lost anyone close to me, really.  Distant relatives, etc. but never a friend or close family member.  Thinking that I lost Rain, a person I had known for six years by that point, was unfathomable.  We had burned the midnight oil together on many occasions, having conversations until the sun literally came up.  A love of music is a common bond and I couldn't even begin to imagine going to live shows without her.  As communication became more accessible, I learned that everyone I knew was okay.  I was grateful.  I was grateful that Shelly procrastinated on her paper, that Rain didn't go to work.  I felt an overwhelming sadness for those who lost loved ones and I felt guilty because I could still talk to those I loved when I needed them.  I'm grateful for every conversation, cup of coffee, live show and literary reading I have with them.  Every single one.  The memories of what I watched on the news will never fade, neither will the fear I felt when I thought of my friends in New York.  I just hope I never have to re-live that fear."

I'm getting my income tax check sometime in the next week or so, so I can take care of car issues that I've been putting off.  Sleater-Kinney is playing NY and I may actually be able to afford a ticket.  I've got the next two weekends off and I didn't request them off.  Maybe a chance meeting at the movies will really change my life.  For as rotten as I feel and as badly as my chest hurts, I can't help but feel more optimistic about how things are going.  Maybe it's because the weather's getting warmer or that I've actually got some great ideas coming to me.  I'm not even stressing about how I'm going to put them into words, which is a good change."

"event","The title of this entry is from an Anthrax song Rain was singing the other night on the way to Starlight.  I had it running through my head most of the day because of most of the customers I had to deal with.  Coupon weekends bring the assholes out of the woodwork and the king of all assholes picked me to harass today, demanding I contact EVERY Bombay Co. store in the nation to get a clearance item he just had to have.  I wanted to knock him silly and I would have if I had a get out of jail free card. The joy of working tomorrow is that I get to deal with him all over again because he's coming back.  Happy, happy...joy fucking joy.   Overall, it was quite a busy day, hustling furniture to and fro and taking people's money.  Driving home, I was listening to Sleater-Kinney and I just felt so lonely.  I've got a great family, great friends, but there's something missing.  I try to ignore it and sometimes, I can't get away with it.  It's been at least two years since I've been involved in a relationship.  Most of the time, I don't even think about it.  But there are some days, especially like one I had today, that I just want to go and curl up with someone.  I just want to cuddle, be held...  I feel like I'm so out of practice that I wouldn't know what to do if I did meet someone.  I already feel like an awkward tool when I talk to people and I'm terrified that I might actually meet someone that I can connect with.  People keep assuring me that I'm going to meet someone, but whether or not I meet them before I turn 90 remains to be seen."

"event","For the first time ever, I'm posting two entries on the same day.  Tonight was Girlsalon and I read a piece of Drive.  I think it went well.  It helped a little with my rapidly depleting confidence in my abilities.  The way things were left with the Ledger damaged more than my income, apparently.  Do I still feel like writing isn't worth it anymore?  A little.  Do I still feel like giving up?  Yes.  Will I?  No.  I'm proud of myself for doing what I did tonight.  That sense of pride feels strange because it's been so long since I've had anything to be proud of. I know it'll pay off in the end, but I wish I had a crystal ball, so that I could assure myself that all of this- the aggravation, anxiety, unhappiness, anger and sadness- will be worth it."

"event","Spring starts on March 20th.  So tell me why we're expecting like six more inches of snow?  It's going to be another slow night at the Bombay Co. and you can only clean glass display shelves so many times before you want to go postal and Windex someone to death.  So in the mean time, maybe I'll just stand in the doorway and chat with the people from Lens Crafters, since they stand in the doorway when they're slow.  Tonight is my reading at Girlsalon.  I'm reading another part of Drive, which some people seem to like.  I'm nervous as hell about it.  I know I shouldn't be.  My work's good enough.  But there's this little annoying, nagging voice in the back of my mind that tells me they're going to laugh at me, they're going to make fun of my work.  It's been almost 10 years since I graduated high school and closed that chapter of my life.  But there are things that linger and I hate my peers for leaving those marks on me.  I've come far since then, but those little lingering things annoy me because try as I might, I can't completely overcome them.  So tonight, I'll have myself a beer (just one or I will puke for sure), take a deep breath and make myself relax before I get up there.  I'll be fine.  I hope."

"event","Warning: The following entry is another ""my life sucks"" rant.  In case you can't tell from the tone of some of my past postings, I'm rather unhappy with my life as of late.  Perhaps it's the bills hanging over my head and the unhappy knowledge that my entire paycheck is going to be split between my car insurance and a student loan I haven't paid in two months, leaving me with just about enough gas money to get me to my next check.  By the way, that check is also already spent, paying off a fine for not getting my car repaired (I had to get busted at some point) and for an oxygen sensor so I can go through inspection and fail again for something else.  I hate NJ DMV.  I feel like I'm treading water and all I'm doing is sinking.  I don't necessarily hate my job, I just have a severe dislike of corporations, especially ones that you work hard for and they don't even care enough to reward you.  Am I a hypocrite because I keep my job?  Maybe, but that distasteful corporation and its lousy $9 an hour is the only thing keeping me from defaulting on my student loans and losing my car insurance.  I'm not proud of where I am right now.  Sometimes, I feel like an embarassment and an also-ran.  I don't want to be the person people talk about when they say, ""whatever happened to so-and-so?  She was a pretty talented writer.""  I worked hard for eight years to learn a trade (sports writing) and earn the respect of my co-workers and my rivals from other papers.  I take a little satisfaction in the knowledge that I did secure a degree of respect and I was able to work as a journalist for as long as I did without a formal classroom education.  I learned nothing from a classroom, all from the newsroom and what do I have to show for it?  Hundreds of clips forgotten in an archive somewhere and a job as a furniture jockey. I feel like I've done everything right, got the degree like I should have, worked with some very good writers whom helped me improve, asked the questions that needed to be asked, etc. and I feel like I've been left empty handed.  I feel like it's a sick joke that someone failed to let me in on and that sick joke is my life.  Sometimes, I'll stare at a project I'm working on and I want to do nothing more than delete it and give up, maybe go get a paralegal certificate and forget about writing.  Who would really care about my characters or their dilemas?  Who would give a shit if I myself, their creator, didn't give a shit?  Then I just realize I'm being an idiot and that I'm throwing myself a pity party.  So instead, I save what I'm doing and walk away.  I didn't expect the road to my dreams to be paved in gold.  I just didn't expect it to be paved with such disappointment and frustration."

"event","I don't hate snow.  Honestly, I don't.  I get to play in it, watch my dog play in it, sometimes I get a day off because of it...I get to watch people bust their asses in it.  I just hate having to drive in it and its aftermath, which I had to deal with today.  It's MARCH and it's snowing, ice, etc.  Spring's supposed to start Sat., but I think Mother Nature's just jerking our chains.  I did get my sick time, thank god, because I've got bills to pay.  The computer was just being dumb.  I'm one of three people left in charge while my manager is out of town and I even said to her today, ""The extent of my control is, 'please don't do whatever you're doing.  You're not supposed to be doing that.'""  I'm a step below management, so basically all I am is an apron wearing, box cutter wielding, key toting babysitter.  I do work with a great bunch, but sometimes they can get a little out of hand and that's kind of bad, especially when there's customers in the store and they're misbehaving.  Aside from that exciting tidbit, I still haven't heard from the interview I had last week, but then again that was on Thurs. and today's Tues.  I guess I'm being a neurotic FREAK.  I just need a job that actually pays above the poverty level.  Keep your fingers crossed.  I'm reading at Girlsalon on Thurs. night and I'm a little nervous, because I think the new place is a bit bigger than the old one and I haven't finished the piece I want to read.  Granted, it's part of a long narrative, but I have to section off a bit and clean it up so I don't sound like a complete moron.  Maybe I should see if there's some kind of writer's block be-gone charm or dance or something and do it before I sit down at the keyboard.  I'm just a TAD frustrated with my fucking writer's block."

"event","Once again, I have resurrected from the writer's block grave.  It's been a while and nothing has happened, except my job is trying to screw me out of sick time because I woke up Tues. morning in so much pain I couldn't move my right arm really.  You'd think I'd have the fucking time because I've been there since July.  I really do need a better job.  I had an interview with a healthcare staffing company, but I'm really torn about it.  I mean, I wanted to make writing my career.  I've known I've wanted to be nothing but a writer since I was in high school.  I even got to play professional writer for eight years and I loved it.  My mom even said it- I'm getting further and further away from what I wanted to do, but the job market isn't leaving me much choice.  My student loans are piling up, my car insurance went up for some reason and a friend reminded me today that I turn 27 in nine months.  27.  And I'm still living with my parents, Drive has stalled AGAIN (motherfuckingwritersblocksucks) and the ATM laughs at me when I go to get money.  Two positives: Girlsalon is this Thurs., the 18th and I'm reading.  I just need to put the finishing touches on what I want to read and I'm good to go.  My friend Mick is back in NJ for a bit before she's off on another adventure.  She has asked me to contribute a piece to her zine and I will be, a story about America's obsession with breasts.  Okay.  Enough bitching.  I'm going to go put my sudden creative streak to work and maybe make some headway on the piece I want to read.  Just one last thought: If I found a genie on a beach, I'd rub the bottle and wish for a) 100 million dollars (I'd settle for enough to settle my debts and get me on my own), b) a permanent end to fucking writer's block, c) the girl of my dreams, whoever that is."

"event","Yeah, so it's been a while.  I've never been very good at keeping journals, but I'm going to try to stay on top of this, dammit.  I'm currently putting off working on Drive.  I'm at a part where former lovers have confronted each other and one has left the other completely heart broken.  Where do I go from there?  See why I'm putting it off?  I want to read this piece at Girlsalon on March 18th.  I've been reading there since Oct. (I nearly puked before I got up on stage the first time) and I've been reading pieces of Drive since Nov.  I'm still waiting word on whether or not a piece I submitted to an anthology made the cut.  I'm driving myself crazy thinking about it.  I just want to know, yes or no.  That was the cool thing about being a reporter- I knew right then and there if it was going to make the paper as it was or if it needed to be re-worked.  At any rate, I'm going to this reading and I'm going to do my damndest to network.  I have to get back to professional writing.  I think I've got the talent or at least something to work with and I hope to god I've got the fortitude to stick out a freelance career.  It's a deep seated itch inside of me that I can't quite get at.  It can make you crazy after a while, especially when you're tying on your apron at your current job and you think, ""this so isn't where I want to be.""  I want to be seated at a desk, with my things around me, my AP style guide, my desk calendar, writing on a deadline.  But I know I'll never go back to daily news.  I've become a better writer since I left daily news because now I work on my terms.  I don't want to endanger that."

"event","Yes, it's Saturday evening and I'm home alone.  I don't mind.  I'm tired, a little low on funds and just not very interested in being social at the moment.  I'm wearing flannel pants with skiing reindeer on them and a ratty old sweatshirt.  I can't get much sexier than this if I tried, dammit.  We had a busy day at work today, which was a nice change from staring at my equally bored co-workers for the duration of my shift.  We changed out our window displays and as I was putting mine together, in full view of all passers by, I got this feeling someone was watching me.  So I turned a little and sure enough, there was this lady, standing close enough to the glass that it was fogging.  So I waved a little at her and she just continued to stare, giving me a thorough case of the creeps.  As my friend Shelly once said, ""It's like the lights are on, but even the ghosts skipped town.""  I guess I shouldn't be too mean, because someone may look at me and say the same thing.  God knows I've been accused of being brain dead at times.  Now I'm debating about whether or not I want to go revise a vampire slayer story I've been struggling with, watch an episode or two of the second season of Alias, play a round of Age of Mythology and try to kill that pesky Titan or just go to bed.  Hmmmmmmm....."

"event","I just took a walk out in the snow.  I used to do that with this olde english sheep dog I had that died when I was 16.  Sometimes, I feel like I've got to go somewhere, do something, but I've got to get away.  From what, I don't know.  I chalk it up to some kind of panic attack.  I've had about three or four of these in my lifetime.  When this happens, I want to crawl out of my skin.  I want to get to somewhere, anywhere, as long as its far from where I already am.  Because of the snow, I couldn't just take off in my car.  So I walked.  Fast.  I had to cut the walk short because I went out in sneakers and my feet froze.  I am so frustrated with my life.  I feel like I've been lied to.  I was always led to believe that if I got a college degree, doors galore would open up for me.  That promise is in a black, white and red folder, collecting dust.  It symbolizes five and a half years of hard work and the hope that it would all mean something.  Yeah, right.  Things started promising enough with the newspaper job, but where am I now?  Selling furniture, underpaid and out of professional writing.  Not that I hate what I do now, but I loved sports writing.  I just hated all the crap that went with it and now I don't even have that.  I have the education, the experience and I have nothing to show for it.  I have a half finished book that I've been working on for three years and I feel like it's going nowhere.  I am so far from where I wanted to be by this point in my life and I don't know where to go from here.  Maybe leaving New Jersey would do me some good, get me some perspective.  But then again, I thought that when I signed on to do an internship for Disney.  After seven months and thousands of hot dogs, the best thing I could come up with was a severe hatred toward people in general.  Maybe if I headed west, checked out things in California and the Pacific Northwest, but that again leads me back to one thing: my current job does not pay well.  I want to leave my life, just for a little while.  Maybe when I eventually do leave and come back this time, I'll have a better view of things.  Maybe.  At least I can put some hope in that."

I met up with my friend Kira tonight and we talked for a few hours over hot tea and french fries.  It's freezing outside.  Is spring coming anytime soon?  Please tell me it is.  I did manage to get booked for a variety show called Girlsalon, which is being held March 18th in New York.  I'm going to be reading during the literary hour.  I have no idea what I'm going to read yet, but probably something from my book.  The book is set in northern Jersey and it's about two girls in love.  I'm trying to tell it from both of their points of view, with one narrative taking place during their senior year of high school and the other picking up at the start of their junior year of college.  It's been a work in progress for almost three years and it's been a difficult process at times.  I've got a substantial amount of material I'm happy with, but there is so much more work to do.  I just hope I can pull this off."

Gotta love Januarys in retail.  Sometimes, I think about my job and I love it because there's no on-the-job stress like I had in my old job.  I can write better when I get home without the stress and it makes me happier.  At the same time, it's not what I want to be doing with my life.  No one seems to hire a former sports writer than works extremely well under pressure.  Oh, well.  I'm going to keep looking because I can't sell furniture for the rest of my life."

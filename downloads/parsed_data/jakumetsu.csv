And big mac, I only see him at weightlifting which balls a big one because we don't get to talk but for like 5 minutes.

Speaking of other 9th grades, McKinnley, Ohh boy. Well we were all suppose to gain weight and whatnot right??  Well I gained 8 pounds pete gained 2 and McKinnley gain 28 pounds!!    I MEAN WTF?!   How is it possible to gain that much weight...       I dunno.. 

Anywho, Moving off the whole weight lifting thingy, My life has been some what off a rutine. Get up, go to school, Go to weight lifting, come home, finish homework and eat, Then talk to Leigh ann and who ever maybe be online. Then sleep. Yeah....     Boring to the max isn't it??   Welp, the weekends aren't this bad, but I just want a change...   To shake things up I guess...       I hate plain, old, dull, stff done over and over...  I dunno...

To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me. 
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring, 
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means. 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She doesn't notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

She likes the godsmack and I like agent orange 
Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad 
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty 
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have 

And when she walks, 
All the wind blows and the angels sing. 
She'll never notice me! 

Cause she is watchin' wrestling 
Creamin' over tough guys 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in her eyes 

She likes 'em with a mustache 
Racetrack season pass 
Drivin' in a Trans-Am 
Does a mullet make a man? 

It's like a bad movie 
She is lookin' through me 
If you were me, then you'd be 
Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!"" 
As I fail miserably, 
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want. 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 
She's the girl all the bad guys want! 

There she goes again 
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair 
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated 
All I wanted was to see her naked! 

Now I am watchin' wrestling 
Tryin' to be a tough guy 
Listenin' to rap metal 
Turntables in my eyes 
I can't grow a mustache 
And I ain't got no season pass 
All I got's a moped...moped....moped..... 

It's like a bad movie

Well I suppose since jourdan is on a quest to get everyone in beckley a livejournal I guess I should write in mine at least weekly. 

Okay were to being??   

I'll start off with christmas. I had got my phone like two days early somewhat because I had found it and because I'm not letting 500 minutes for this month go to waste over so dumb holiday. Anyways, I had all so got alot of dumb crappy presents so it looks like santa was nice to everyone. I did get like 200 dollars cash which was really great and a real suprize. Btw I have a little 7 year old brother who still belives so I'm not going to crush the little guys dreams haha. 

That is about all for christmas.

Now for the social part...  Ohh boy, I'll have to sum this up because I'm lazy and all. 

I'll start with friends, nothing big to say there lol. 

Then relationships...    Ohh I don't care anymore I'll get all my dirty secerts out right now. 
I had liked Erica Alderman ever since...  <b>WAY</b> back when in 7th grade...   I think maybe earlier. Anywho...  Jourdan and Jad were up last week end and we were just messing around with her but then I had got pretty serious and then I had asked her to the movies and she said yea. But I had been there before and it just...  horrible lol. I had my heart broken worst then when I was with cassie.  But she was pretty friendly at the game tonight so well see. 

Okay that was the first one lol. 

Now to leigh ann, she lives about 2 hours about but she is probably one of the if not hottest girl I have ever seen. Yet, I feel comfortable around her and could just talk for hours with her. IWe had been talking and she is willing to give it a try if I was so that was in the air I haven't talked to her in about a week but with the new phone I can call her. =D 

Now the third lol. 

Angela...  Wow...  This one is confusing for me. I had been talking to her all year and me and her have been great friends. Yet I hadn't honestly told her I liked her yet, but she kinda knows. Yet, I think she likes over guys. Plus we had dated and it didn't work but that was back in 8th grade all most a year ago today we had broke up. =/      

Now I think this is the last one...  haha  

Jacqueline...    
Geez...   You can just talk to her about it lol  
It is to late now and I'm tired haha"

Moving on from that http://www.livejournal.com/users/ophelia04/11506.html 
Read that...     God... How can that be the same person as I was talking to 3 days ago. Talking about how she needs to date alot of people and now talking about how she found the one.  
What did I miss?? What don't I have that he does?? ((Other then emtional stablity but that comes with cassie and is lost without her))

Read down people I have the pyhsical part and the pure love that was there better then him...   

But god... I was madly in love with her. Letting her date pj and not saying alot. I mean...   I really wanted her to be happy and then June 1st-ish I think I saw her at the mall missed my chance again. Well I didn't I actually asked her but she never said anything and me loving her so much didn't want her to feel werid about it so I didn't say a word. MAn... Was I dumb. 

I know I shouldn't think about her and I try not to but she was my first true love and with this stuff between me and lea it doesnt help thinking back. 

I mean...  I am not that bad. Thanks to me doing situp and all that junk since football has been over I actually have a real six pack and muscles lolSo I have a body. My face isn't bad. I just know that some girl out there ((That isn't fat)) likes me and I like her just as much back...   Or at least not blow it like I did the last two

Anywho, What do I wanna say??    I dunno...    I have been thinking about life and death.  It doesn't make sence...  You don't have a set reason why your here...  I feel like I have just been wasting my life. I could say I am going to say I'm going to do something but I'm not lol   I like not doing anything but every now and then I get that feeling like I should do something...   

I dunno I also been thing about relationships and how I want one. But I can never find someone that wants the same thing I want. I mean I want a serious relationship but I also want to...  you know have fun with her. Still haven't a girl...  I'm tried of waiting lol     Ohh well, that is a big deal to me I guess

But I think I'll start you out with old stuff.  

Football is over FINALLY. But it starts again next month, this is just a hardcore sport you have to fun to understand and play it ((I know, I sound like cassie going on about XC extreme cross country)) but this is a real sport. My point was that I'm not going to do it alone. Kyle said he is probably going to play. 

Ohh and btw I use to be afraid to say something like that but now I think she is a horrible person so I don't care. =D   It is great, I dunno why I couldn't do that from the being. Actually I do know because I had and probabaly to this moment is still obsessing over her. What I am doing better now though is trying not to think about her. 

Speaking of women, I broke up with lea. I really hated to do it but there wasn't anything there. No spark and sexually activity. I see everyone feeling and touching. I'm afraid to touch her without upsetting her, that is a hint to just let it go. 

Now that I am single again, I'm going to try and find my true friends again that I lost touch with. ((Jourdan, Jad, Kyle, and yes Musa))

"event","I haven't made a real post in my journal in a really long time... 
I think this might be my first one. Mmmkay here it goes.
I slept in til 4 today ((Becuase I could plus I am a bum so I don't care XD)) Anyway, Jad called and woke me up and ask if I was going to the mall. I said yea, because it was friday and I always go. Plus I haven't seen Jad in forever so I thought it be cool to see him again. Go there and Jourdan playing SC2 ((sidenote: Jourdan got owned when we bet-ed lol))then Kyle came and pete was with him so we go walking for a bit. Then pete wanted to go into the music store and that gay dude there wouldn't let Jad or Jourdan play which sucked. So we just left becuase it was so gay lol and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Cassie jumped on my and Kneed me square in my... my manhood haha I'm still sore. But I was so freaking happy to see her. I dunno about her, but I know that I like her again. =D
But most likely we will stay friends but I don't care. I'm glad I can still talk to her"

"event","<i> <Center> Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home

But I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice Inside my head said, ""Don't look back. You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but-

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone <i/> <Center/>"

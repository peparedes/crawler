In reality, not all that long. But long enough to make it <i>seem</i> like it was longer.

We - my <i>su'fali</i>, my <i>rujholla</i> and I - have born witness to some of the more bizarre things this world has to offer. But some things are easier to understand than others.

Weddings are easy to understand. So are births and deaths - those are a frequent thing in my home.

Even the notion of humans taking animal shape is nothing worth getting concerned about.

But <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/divaerestor"">peo</a><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/taurof_gondolin"">ple</a> becoming <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=divaerestor&itemid=18865"">ani</a><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=taurof_gondolin&itemid=32485"">mals</a> - unwillingly - that is another matter.

I'd help <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/divaerestor"">th</a><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/taurof_gondolin"">em</a>, but I have been told by my <i>lir</i> <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/2846815"">Kiri</a> that I have <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=liegeman_ian&itemid=2515"">a bigger matter</a> to think about here. What it is, she will not tell me; only that I need to keep my focus during the next few days or weeks.

This isn't that unusual - <i>lir</i> keeping secrets, but gods, it can be so <b>maddening</b> at times...

*sigh*

I suppose if I'm to do what Kiri asks, I need to go outside and do a few patrols around the grounds.

Preferably <b>without</b> getting lost in these lands...

*blurs to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/2846843"">fox-shape</a> and runs off, Kiri following behind*"

Ian suggests that we save up our reserves and try to use the earth magic on him. I'm just hoping that the magic doesn't have an effect on him. From what I've conjected, he can shift between stallion, half-elf, fox, and elf. With being able to take on that many forms, the magic may cause difficults... *sighs heavily* I suppose since I won't be able to use my <i>lir</i> form for a few days before and after, I'd better take a romp now...Kiri?

"event","<i>Corin walks into his sleep chambers followed by his deep red </i>lir<i>, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/2709213"">Kiri</a>. He settles down for a long rest, with the little vixen cuddling up next to him. The darkness comes, and they both slip into that alternate world where reality is suspended. 

Corin dreams. He dreams of a place filled with forests, elves, humans, halflings, dwarves, and others. They are strange to him. He tries calling out to Kiri for advice, but she can't be reached while he's sleeping. The link is denied to him. He runs. Running from anything. But he cannot escape. He is trapped within the dream. A large shape comes towards him, black, and the face is masked. The creatures goes to show his head, and suddenly...

He's awake. Corin thrashes around, looking for his </i>lir<i>, and sees her laying nearby. Only then does he realize that he's not in his bed, but under a large tree instead. Again, he sees a figure moving towards him, but it's different. Two white foxes come into focus. Corin tenses, not knowing what to expect of them since they are from a different place than he's used to. 

'</i>Lir, shansu<i>, the one is a </i>lir<i> like myself, and the other is a what is described as a Cheysuli-elf. Zy says that Glorfindel will not harm you in anyway. Only that they are waiting for his <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~liegeman_ian"">companion</a> to successfully rescue his <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~daughteroflions"">harana</a>, Keely.'  Kiri says softly.

'Keely?! Here? If she's in trouble, I must help her! She's my twin rujholla.'

'Zy says that he and Glorfie made it able for Ian and Tasha to enter and try to help her. We should know soon to what happens.'

He nods, and turns to the two foxes. Glorfindel blurs back to his human form and stands before Corin. Each of them looks into the other's eyes, and have only to see that each is true to the other. That they will never turn on one another, almost like a </i>tu'alla dei<i> or leige man to the other. Although, not quite the same thing. They sit without words, awaiting the news...."

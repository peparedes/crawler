As of now, my dad's out of job.  That means I can't go to college right now.  My parents have no money in the bank.  I'm working a full time job in order to save to go to community college where ever I end up living and I'm applying to get a weekend job just in case my mom needs  back surgery even worse than she does now.

I had to take care of her all weekend because her back went out and my dad is completely oblivious. lol.  

I just feel alone. . .again.   I haven't really been truly happy in over two years.  I've just been trying to get by, slide to the next step.  

I have no other step.  I feel like it may be falling apart.  


I hope everything turns out okay.  


I kind of want to run away, now.  I want to join the circus for a while."

 Artist: Liz Phair 
 


 
 [high part:] 
Everytime I see your face I get all wet between my legs 
Everytime you pass me by, I heave a sigh of pain 

[low part:] 
Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste 
I want to <b>fuck</b> you like a dog 
I'll take you home and make you like it 
Everything you ever wanted 
Everything you ever thought of 
Is everything I'll do to you 
I'll fuck you and your minions, too 
Your face reminds me of a flower 
Kind of like you're underwater 
Hair's too long and in your eyes 
Your lips a perfect <b>""suck me""</b> size 
You act like you're fourteen years old 
Everything you say is so obnoxious, funny, true and mean 
I want to be your <b>blowjob</b> queen 
You're probably shy and introspective 
That's not part of my objective 
I just want your fresh, young jimmy 
Turning, slamming, ramming in me 
Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste 
I want to fuck you like a dog 
I'll take you home and make you like it 
Everything you ever wanted 
Everything you ever thought of 
Is everything I'll do to you 
I'll fuck you till your <b>dick</b> is blue 

Everytime

<b>Jane Fonda</b>

<i>I had a baby named Jane 
she could shake that thing 
said her daddy used to hang with Johnny Coltrane 
she sang the soul train with a friend named Jen 
her booty was bigger than a Mercedes Benz 
Jen was a hurty burty dirty little girlie 
I heard it from a birdie she could cook a mean turkey 
with gravy 
Baby Baby Baby... 
Baby was Jen's best friend 
and maybe if you were lucky 
licky licky sucky sucky 
Mickey Mickey, fuck me fuck me 
more junk in her trunk than a Honda 
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda 

One, two, three, four 
get your booty on the dance floor 
work it out, shake it little momma 
lemme see you do the Jane Fonda 
five, six, seven, now 
if you don't know, let me show you how 
to work it out, work it little momma 
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda 

I had a princess, queen of incest 
she was inbred but Jean had big breasts 
and big eyes and a big ass to match 
Jean wasn't fast, she was easy to catch 
then came Molly 
a hood from Hollywood High 
so fly she was transatlantic 
she was a manic depressive 
[manic depressive] 
which was impressive 
very impressive 
I had to test it 
tasted like chicken and was lemon scented 
she took me home to her mama 
I taught 'em both how to Jane Fonda 

One, two, three, four 
get your booty on the dance floor 
work it out, shake it little momma 
lemme see you do the Jane Fonda 
five, six, seven, now 
if you don't know, let me show you how 
to work it out, work it little momma 
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda 

I had a doll named Dana from Santa Ana 
she was a waitress at the Copa Cabanna 
she was slammin' and her ass was jammin' 
like Janet Jackson in the Rhythm Nation 
her brother jason had a girl named Grace 
and you could see her ass from outer space 
so I landed on her planet 
and I planted a Mickey Av flag in it, dammit! 

One, two, three, four 
get your booty on the dance floor 
work it out, shake it little momma 
lemme see you do the Jane Fonda 
five, six, seven, now 
if you don't know, let me show you how 
to work it out, work it little momma 
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda 

One, two, three, four 
get your booty on the dance floor 
work it out, shake it little momma 
lemme see you do the Jane Fonda

I bought <font color=green><b>Cursive:<i>The Ugly Organ</font></b></i> last weekend.  It's pretty much the best thing ever. I love the mix of so many instruments in a dark way.  As in, the organ is played in a creepy manner as opposed to a melodic way.  I love it.  &hearts;  It's kind of one of those albums that you listen to when you are pissed or something.

Anyway, some of you know that Joe and I are starting a band. <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/joehotlovin"">Just Another Hero</a>  We haven't recorded anything, but during Christmas, Joe is coming to visit me in Memphis and we are going to record some stuff on my computer.

I liked Jesse a kazillion times more! <3 Anyway...would you like for me to make up for lost time?  Well...This is the best I can do.  Jesse made me feel so good/happy.  He made me feel things that I have never felt before. BUT anyway, I can't go back so I am moving on although in the process, I am missing him.  I need some lovin' right now.

"event","Yesterday, I went to see Relient K...

        We left at about 12.30 to 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  We (my mom and I) picked up Caroline and then headed on our quest to see Relient k in Louisville, KY! When we finally finished our trip at about 4:15, we looked for Jillian's Louisville, sports bar.  We found it and then drove around to find somewhere to eat, but couldn't find anywhere.  I finally said ""why don't we eat at Jillian's?""  When we went in, there were already about 30-40 people lined up waiting to go in and it didn't even start until 7:00.  

        We went in to eat and I was too excited to eat anything, so I made Caroline hurry and finish so we could go wait outside.  By the time we got out there there were another 50-60 people waitng.  IT WAS FREEZY COLD OUTSIDE!!!!  (I had an extra ticket and I scalped it...wooo...i am such a rebel.)

        The doors were supposed to open at 6:00, but didn't open until 7:30.  THat means that we waited outside for about 2-2 1/2 hours!  After we got in, we thought there would be seats.  We were surprised.  It was all festival seating.  People packed into this 30x30 room (not including the stage).  There ended up being 1000-1500 people packed into this room.  We were all body to body.  

        Luckily, Caroline and I got within 10 feet of the stage.  We were waiting another 20 minutes after we actually got in there.  So the concert didn't start until about 8:15.  Caroline and I, being 5'4'' HAD to get behind these guys who were like 6'4''!  We had to find these window of heads during the whole concert.

        House of Heroes started the concert.  They were so good.  THey incorporated ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" by Queen into the beginning and end of their set.  I have to say that was pretty ""schweet!""  

        Maxeen played next.  Out of all of the warm up bands, they were my favorite.  I swear the lead singer was Elijah Wood in cognito, he was really hot, though.  When they came on, everyone started mosh pitting, but the security guards stopped them. That didn't stop anyone from trying it anyway, as in, they tried like 15 times!  People were picking other people up over their heads and pushing them to the front, but yet again the security guards took them away.  

       It was so freakin' hot in there that this girl in front of us fainted.  People were sweating like pigs in there.  Caroline was like ""I smell!"" and so I said ""Do I smell?"" I lifted up my arm and she smelled my armpit, it was awesome.  

       The Rocket Summer came on and all I have to say is....""WHATEVA!""

       Finally, the moment we had been waiting for, Relient K was up.  People were chanting their name.  It was like a movie.  It was called the Matthew Hoopes Birthday tour, so they obviously started out with an odd rendition of ""Happy Birthday"".  It started out all sweet and then became all hip-hoppy, it was hilarious.  They came on and everyone went crazy!  They were singing to all of the songs.  When ""Fallin' in love with the 80s"" began I called Jesse, held for about a minute, then hung up.  He called back. It was funny.  

      AFterwards, We filed out and bought t-shirts.  We thought Relient K would have a signing, but found out they weren't. We were sad!  This is how we found out.  Some people from the other bands were signing autographs and taking pictures.  MY MOM ASKED THE LEAD SINGER OF THE ROCKET SUMMER IF RELIENT K WERE GOING TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS!  How hilarious is that?  He was trying to take picture with someone else and it was just so perfect.  MY mom is totally hardcore. Caroline got her picture with House of Heroes.  I wanted my picture with Maxeen, but the lead singer wasn't out there.  

     We left to go to the hotel and that was that.

     Basically, it was a bunch of sweaty, hormonal, teenagers with loud music.  It was so fun.  I have never done anything like that at all.  I love it!

     We came, we saw, we conquered! 



P.S. I will post pictures later!"

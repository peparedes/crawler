"event","*After getting kicked out of Kai and Saru's lovenest during the mass-move, Nagasumi had been staying in the Nurse's Office. In that time, Priscilla had neglected to get the letter with his new room number in it- she'd only graced him with the coffee-stained, crumpled up envelope today.    

To her credit, she at least gave him a box of chocolates as an apology. 

But, hmm.. Kafuka and Zushio in room 344. The second name really sounded familiar-- 

OH WHATEVER ENOUGH THINKING HE WANTED A SHOWER NOW. Tucking the box of sweets under his arm, he rapped on the door three times!*"

Oh well, these lawns ain't gonna trim themselves. Feel free to bother him as he moves his strong, bare shoulders with the mower, and gently wipes sweat from his <i>manly</i> brow.*"

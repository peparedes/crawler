i really have nothing i want to hide anymore.. 
i'm so wonderfully happy in every way and i really don't mind the world knowing.
it's just another button to push. 

thing is.. if i post non-friends only entries.. i know she'll use them to get to me. 
they'll feed her fantasies.. and she'll comment on them. she'll give me crap.. and i don't want more of her crap.

i knew getting into this job i'd see her. it's inevitable. and i knew jensen was just being silly when he told me she'd come once and then ""run away forever"" because ""everyone she knows knows us and like us better than her"" 
i knew he just really wanted to use that quote from that movie.. cuz he's cute like that. i didn't expect her to never come in just because i'm there.. and i applied for this job assuming i'd be willing to deal with that. and i am. i don't mind seeing her.. but i do mind coming home to her silly livejournal comments.

the only way i see out of this is by making.. yet again.. another livejournal.
i've grown rather attached to this one.. but i really don't see any other options.

besides of course.. taking billy up on his offer to um ""make sure she never bothers me again."" but i don't want to go that far. it'd likely make things worse and violence is just stupid. 

there is also cat's idea of a restraining order.. but that still seems like a little much. 

maybe i should stop being stubborn and keep posting friends only entries.


fuck. why can't i be in sacramento already?
you know that whole ""distance makes the heart grow fonder"" crap?
well. it's true. this time at least. it never has been before.. i usually just end up forgetting everything about the person.. but this time.. this time it's too true. and i miss that boy so much.
he keeps trying cheer me up by telling me that in a few months we'll be together again.. and we'll be that way forever. that we have the rest of our lives to spend together.. but thats still a few months away.. and i really want the rest of our lives to start now. 

we have a ""phone date"" tonight.
it was his idea. i love it. 
haha, hey.. at least now we have something to talk about. the ""alex drama"" yet again.
will that girl ever realize that enough is enough?
as if him hanging up on her when she calls isn't a big enough hint.

okay so. i guess i'll go do <i>more</i> laundry and dream up some excitingly fabulous name for a new lj.
love y'all,
steph.

p.s. i freaking adore this job. it's perfect. i've never been happier."

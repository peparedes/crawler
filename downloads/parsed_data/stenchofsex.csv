"event","so, since my last post, i've already made some improvements.
i lost four pounds... at least five more & i'll be happy.
ten more is my goal, but that's mostly to keep me motivated.
i go tanning about three or four times a week.
i'm not significantly darker, but i'm getting there for sure.
i also dyed my hair a solid really dark brown color.
i just want my size 26 lux skinny jeans to fit without me struggling.
all in all, i'm happy with my accomplishments."

"event","the week before halloween when i saw my mom, she called my chubby.
& then last week she called me pale & said i have no color.
i said ""duh.""
i'm gonna be tan and skinny just so she has nothing to bitch about.
i know she's just saying it in a joking manner,
but when my own mother tells me things like this, i take it to heart.
she's not a bad mom at all & i love her a lot.
i'm just going to better myself physically so looking at me is less of a pain."

i'm sick of walking out of my house feeling self-conscious.
today starts a brand new me.
i woke up at 9 today & went tanning.
i'm going to start excersizing & eating right.
i don't want my rolls hanging off my jeans anymore.
i'm going to take better care of myself
& it's going to show externally.
i'm going to clean out my car today
& start on my room.
seeing as how i'm almost 21, it's time i started acting like it.
as for partying, i'm sure i'll still go out,
but i need to focus more attention on important things.
i want to have a career within the next year.

creepy joe philly was this guy i got with when i first moved to the city.
he asked me to be his girlfriend like the second time we hung out.
i said no, obviously, & he still hasn't fucking gotten over it.
right from the start he was being a dickhead to me.
he kept saying that i was a slut & i was digging myself into a hole.
i told him he was out of his goddamn mind & he was wrong because i like life now.
& he said something about me being college degree-less & having 2 boyfriends.
but then i thought about it, i haven't dug myself into a hole,
i've finally found the right footing to get myself out.
i mean, i went back to school, i'm handling working 2 jobs, i love my family,
i love my friends (even though i may not have a lot of them, the ones i have are awesome.),
i live in a house with my best friend, & i have a boy who really cares about me.
i can honestly say that if i died today, i would die happy.
i realized you can't dwell on the past because it really doesn't even matter anymore.
what's done is done & there is no way to go back & change anything.
even if i could, i wouldn't... from everything i've done, good or bad, i've learned.

"event","i think it's really important to not surround your life around one person.
i'm not saying that boyfriends or girlfriends are bad things,
but when they become your life & you neglect your old friends who have always been there for you,
it will wind up leaving you all alone in the end.
when you need someone to talk to, no one will be there.
& when the relationship ends, no one will be there to pick up the pieces.
i think relationships are important, but all relationships, not just romantic ones.
& maybe i'm guilty of this, i don't really know.
yea, i hang out with wayne a lot, but i still manage to not forget my other friends.
it just so happens that i don't have that many close friends, so it's easier for me.
i don't like the feeling of being a good friend completely ousted by a new girlfriend or boyfriend.

the new house is coming together very nicely.
even though half my shit still isn't here.
i found a cure for my kitten's crazies.
it's a really long piece of elastic with a mouse on the end that hangs at the top of a door.
he absolutely loves that thing.
he hasn't bitten, scratched, etc. me since i've put it up.
i got him a spikey collar too.
he's such a little bad ass.

it's been so slow... it's really weird.

ah the days of leg warmers, neon & feathered bangs.

i love the friends that i have now.
but i really wish i had a girl bestfriend.
i don't exactly see it ever happening.
anyhu, school starts in like a week.
i just want it to be done & over with.
my mom thinks i'm too smart to be a flight attendant.
it's probably true, but it's not gonna stop me from doing it.
there are some very noisy kids outside my house.
i'm about to sick scuz on them.

yesterday i drove down to get him after class.
i got him this really cute stuffed penguin
because he really likes penguins
& his cousin was put in jail this week
& one of his friends from sc shot himself yesterday.
he hadn't had a good week, so i took him out to keep his mind off things.
we went over to phila & walked around south street.
then we took a little adventure that didn't go over so well.
we went back to his house & watched <i>health inspector</i>,
which, if you haven't seen it yet... you should.
i stayed over there & drove him to work this morning.
then i came back here & passed out until like now.
i need to start packing & shit.
we start cleaning the house & everything on saturday.
which is in 3 days... more like 2.
i am so excited to finally have somewhere to settle.
for the past 3 years i've been moving from place to place.
i know i'm going to be in this house for at least a year.
it's just such an awesome feeling.
i don't know when we'll actually be all moved in.
i'm so excited to live with lou again.
i miss that motherfucker... but don't tell him.
erin's going to be over a lot, too... which is ummmm awesome.
i love that i finally have a girl around sometimes.
handling lou's flatulation is a strenuous job.
my kitten is such an asshole.
maybe he'll be better when he has an entire house to run around in.
he fucking better be.
no, i love him though.
i write the most pointless entries ever.
but at least this one is happy.
i just figure i need to surround myself with the people who make me happy.
yea, he's not ready for a relationship, but i'll take what i can get.
i know he cares about me & i know he knows how much i care about him.
maybe things will change eventually.
it's christmas, anything can happen."

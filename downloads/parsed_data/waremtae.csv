"event","A poem for you... Ok so none of the words rhyme and none of the sentences go together but if I want to call it a poem then fuck you people.  Either read the shit or don't.  My life does not hinge on your decision. (It does,I need acceptance,read read).
Any way I have discovered few, very few, sure things in life.  In no random order here they are, in a not so poemey poem, just for you, to ignore, you fucks.
If you go into a crowded elevator and say ""Man, have I got gas""  people WILL run.  They may be enclosed in a 2000lb steel trap moving at about 1 mile per hour, but those people will run.  Now, if you go into the same building that contains said elevator and yell fire those same people who would run into walls, steel walls, to get out of a gas filled nasal death trap...those people will just stand there.  They may look around, they may pick some lunch out of their teeth or their pants out of their ass, but do they run?  No!! And why don't they run?  They actually want to SEE the fire.  Seriously, next time you have the chance, without risking loss of job or life, because you may be pummeled later, just yell fire in a building.  Then look for superman... he's fucking there I swear to god he is.  He's the guy with his hands on his hips in that superman stance, you can almost see the wind blowing his hair, and he stands there and says:  ""Fire, where is this fire you speak of"".  As if he could put it out with his stance.  ""This fire would be crazy to try and pass me when I am standing like this aaahhhhaaahhhaaahhhaaa!!!!""  Yeah, you know the guy I mean.  Every office has one.  Jackass.  The real dilemma comes if there is actually a fire.  Then YOU and YOU ALONE (Thanks Smokey) have the decision of saving him or letting him burn.  Me, I say fuck'em.  Lots of people stand that way and one less may improve the gene pool.  
Number 2 lesson:  Boys are dumb.  Now, I hear some of you bitching (I have really good hearing...yes I heard that too so shut up) but it is true.  Boys are dumb.  They spend YEARS trying to figure out women and NEVER GET IT. WTF??  Did I miss a meeting?  Women are SOOO easy to figure out it's not even funny.  The fucking rules to Candy Land are harder to figure out than most women.  OK guys, here you go... Be nice to them, cuddle, say sweet things, tell your friends, who know their friends how great they are.  Cause NO ONE can keep a secret.  Do all these things and do you know what you will get in return...fucking nothing because WOMEN ARE EVIL BITCHES.  It's what they do.  Men, you run the government, women hold the balls to that government and threaten to squash them whenever the chance arises.  Yes men, you may wear the uniform, but since your cocks make you act like puppets it is women who pull the strings.  That being said, next time you see a woman, punch her in the crotch, because the government sucks right now.

I was gonna give you 3 lessons but after reading back over this I realized it may be a bit too much for some of you to take... 
I do hope you learned something from my poem that was not a fucking poem and that it will somehow serve to brighten your day... really, I couldn't give a shit but it sounded good at the time.

See ya"

"event","Hello again.  Nope, still not dead yet... workin hard at it though.  I am sure Vic will let you all know when it happens...right Vic??  Few things have changed in my life, but those that have are AMAZING!!  I have decided I am gay.  OK OK, back off ladies, I am kidding... for now.  No, I did however meet a guy.  Yep I said it, a guy.  Yes friends, the ""I will never date again"" queen has had her stone heart melted... but alas, he IS gay.  Ha ha...back the fuck off Chris!!  What can I tell you about him???  Hmmmm, I can tell you how amazing his soul is, how huge his heart is, and that his hands are so big he could crush my skull like a twig.  I said back the fuck off Chris *wink* I already know you got your hands full at the moment baby!!  He is teh HAWT. 
Amber graduated from 5th grade last week.  I cried in the first 3 minutes.  The fucking kids weren't even in the room yet.  I laughed at my self... and I cheered for my lovely daughter.  
Hailey is speaking now.  I hate it when they do that shit.  And now, please gather around for Dot's Story Time.  Hailey speak 101...careful what you hear, or think you hear...
I was taking Amber to her last day of school so we could pick up her stuff.  Hailey was in her car seat in the back, mostly because when I strap her to the roof people stare, and we were driving along.  Hailey starts to babble, you know that cute baby babble, when she says the work ""cock"".  As a parent, what do you do in situations like this.  Well you ""Hear and dismiss"".  Those ARE ""The Rules"".  So I did just that.  I heard, and I dismissed.  But apparently Hailey does not know ""The Rules"" and so she just kept repeating it over and over and over.  So I pull up to the school, already shaken by the innocent new word my sweet baby has picked up, and BTW she didn't get that shit from me cause when would I be talking about it???  Anyway, I park and turn to face my two beauties for the first time in the ride.  Amber looks at me with her angel face and her spirit filled eyes and here is whay she said:  ""Ummm Mom, I don't know what it is, but Hailey wants cock.  She wants it a lot, and she wants it now.""  
Yeah, sure fuckers laugh... I on the other hand, had to follow ""The Rules"".  I had to sit straight faced as I ORDERED Amber to get out of the car.  She looked at me as if I were insane, but away she went.  And then... HOLY SHIT... I ROARED!!  I think I scared Hailey.  I also think I may have fractured a rib.  I had not laughed like that in forever.  Have I laughed like that since?  Yes I have.  Last night.  Love will do that to you.
See you all soon!!"

"event","Mom is on her way back here.  D'ya know that feeling/taste you get in the back of your throat when you burp and puke a little at the same time?  I have had that going on ever since she called to say she was on her way.  

I think I am getting sick again.  I just got over a fucking cold and on Thursday, one of the girls in my office came in and she was sick.  Maybe it's the bird flu, come to pay me back for squashing that peach faced love bird all those years ago.  Serves me right!

I have been SOOOOOOO damn tired lately.  I am in bed at like 9:00 and I am still exhausted when I wake up.  I did have a pretty busy week at work though.  I hope that's all it is.  Wouldn't that just be my luck too.  I am exhausted when mom is gone and when she comes back I am back to normal and then I have to put up with her even more.  

I have been doing laundry all day.  I know what you are thinking, It's only 11:30am, all day has only been a few hours.  To this I will reply FUCK OFF, I've been up since 7 and started as soon as I got out of bed.  I am almost done though and Hailey went down for her nap so that made it quite a bit easier.  

The more I see Casey, the more I know why I left him.  Yes, he was a junkie, but emotionally I left him way before I did physically.  He just got evicted from his second apartment.  Yesterday he came over to ""see Hailey"", (I put up the quotes cause it's not like he has anywhere to go so why not come to my house and watch me take care of our daughter) and I mentioned that on Saturday he has to give me his support money and he just rolled his eyes and said he knows and I don't need to keep reminding him.  Right, cause he's been so good about any form of financial support in the past.  What the fuck was I thinking??  Man, I am just such a jerk!  I should just KNOW that on the 15th of every month he's going to come over, willingly, and hand over money.  PAUSE... Sorry, I had to open the door and let the monkey that just flew out of my ass go outside.

Well, the dryer is calling me so I gotta go for now.  I hope everyone has a better day than mine is shaping up to be."

I got an apartment.  I move in on the 15th.  
My car is still REALLY fucked up.  Now there is a leak in my hydraulic clutch fluid because my slave cylinder is brokeded.  I use about 24oz of fluid a day to keep it running.  
My inspection sticker expired yesterday and I am almost positive that it will fail if I take it in.  
My mom fucked up my puter the other day.  I come walking into the room and she says: ""What's this mean?""  I look at the screen and my beloved computer is in DOS mode and it says it is attempting to recover from a ""Major system failure"".  Now, I have a 4 year warranty and tech support on my baby, but it still PISSED ME OFF!!!  She kept saying all she did was try to go to Pogo to play her games and ""All of the sudden"" the DOS screen came up.  Ya know something, Amber can lie better than that.  Speaking of Amber, she has her own log in on my puter and she gets online all the time... She never did anything to create a ""Major system failure"".  
I just got off the phone with my old boss and she asked if she could stop by to say hi... Don't get me wrong, she is awsome, but this is SOOOOOOO not what I need right now.

Casey has made a complete 360 as far as seeing Hailey is concerned.  He calls and asks if he can come by to see her whenever he has time.  I have to say that she really enjoys seeing him too.  With that said, he still hasn't paid his child support this month(or any month for that matter) and there are still times when he says he will come see her and doesn't call or show up.  I am not getting my hopes up that he has changed for good but the change so far is quite refreshing.  
I have some sort of infection in my lower jaw.  My teeth hurt REALLY FUCKING BAD, and I am now out of vicodin.  Does it make me a freak if I say that sometimes the pain feels kinda... nice.  Not all the time(and certainly not right now), but sometimes.  At the very least, it keeps me on my toes. It explains why I have been so damn tired lately.  Apparently, I have been running a mild fever for the past few days.  Yea me!!

"event","So, I was doing my best to try to get along with Casey and I just don't think I have it in me anymore.  I don't trust him.  I never know if he is telling me the truth or lying.  Some days he seems to have it all togeather and others... it's just the same ol' shit.  Can anyone tell me why I bother?  I mean, I know I try as hard as I do for Hailey, but that can only last so long.  Casey's mom came to get Hailey this morning and she and Casey were supposed to bring her home.  Casey wasn't there.  I don't need anyone to tell me that he didn't see her today.  I am not that thick.  I guess I just had so much hope that he would snap out of his me, me, me world and WANT to spend more time with his daughter.  Oh well, you know what they say:  You can lead a horse to water but if he's a fucking dumb ass you would be better off just shooting him in the fucking head and drinking the water yourself.  
On a lighter note, I am about 10 pounds from my goal weight.  The only bad thing about that is that my clothes are hanging off me.  I still have all my pre-Hailey clothes but not to many of them are good for work.  I did find a dress my mom bought me right after I had Hailey.  I guess she was telling me in her own way that I was fat at the time cause it is a small. I am going to wear it to my office Christmas party.  I look pretty damn hot in it if I do say so my self, and I did just say so, so deal with it or fuck off.  
I need more friends.  Dirty nasty friends who I can tell my dirty nasty secrets to and never have to worry about what they will think of me.  I also need some balls.  Some big hairy ones so I can throw them in the faces of people I need to stand up to.  Kind of like ""talk to the hand"", ya know?  Instead it would be:  Talk to my big hairy balls, mutha fuckers!!!  The only problem is that *most* balls come with men attatched.  Lying, cheating, stealing, asshole MEN!!  No offense to the 6 or 7 of you out there that my statement does not apply to.  You know who you are, and so do I, but I am not a kiss and tell kinda girl.  
Well, I feel a bit better after my minor (and it was MINOR) outburst, so I am gonna go for now.  Have a super night everyone.  I know I will ;0)"

"event","Wow, so much has happened since I was last here I don't even know where to begin.  Honestly, I can't even begin anyway.  I have issues, lets just leave it at that shall we?!?  
I hope everyone is doing well.  When I was here last, a few people were having some problems and I hope those problems have been fixed.  If they haven't, quit whining and join the fucking club.;0)  I miss everyone quite a bit... Some more than others.  Heh heh heh  Please forgive me if I have a few spelling errors in here, I took a vicodin cause my back hurts and I haven't eaten much since Thursday (I haven't been hungry for some reason) so I am kinda mushy headed.  It's kind of nice really.  I am sitting here listening to Tool and feeling quite relaxed.  
So I am prepared for today to be a shitty day.  Casey's mom and step dad (this will be a public entry so no name calling)are coming to pick up Hailey at 8:30am. I must say I have been having serial killer fantasy's about those two... If only I could make it look like an accident. I have recently decided to try and tone down my mean spiritedness toward my enemys.  Sort of a ""be the bigger person"" kinda thing.  It's not working out too well though.  Some cuts are just too fucking deep.  
My car broke down on my way home from taking the kids to the zoo today.  I was there cause there was an EMT picnic and since we, at my work, teach EMT and paramedic classes, we were invited.  It was pretty fun.  The kids had a great time.  Then, we got out to the car.  The car I fucking hate with every ounce of passion I fucking have in my fucking body.  I knew as soon as I put it in 1st gear that there was something wrong.  I got to the light at Norview and Hyde Circle (in Norfolk) and it just wouldn't go into any gear.  I turned on my hazzards and called my sister.  She came and got the kids and I called AAA and waited for the tow truck.  My sister called her husband who, by the way, just got fixed on Friday, and asked him to come look at my car.  He had to come from Hampton and he got there before the tow truck and he fixed my car.  He's not too bright about most things, but he knows his way around a tool box.  All in all it was a great, then shitty, then great, then shitty day.  In other words, a normal day in the life of Dottie.   
Well I gotta go for now.  I am gonna go post some comments in a few of your LJ's so be prepared.  I must say it feels good to be back and I will try to be back to my normal funny, rude and sometimes really bitchy self in my next entry. HAGN."

"event","I have never in my life been so moved by a story that I wrote a letter or signed a petition.  That all changed today.  Today, I saw a documentary called <i>Reckless Indifference</i> on Encore Drama. (A Starz channel)  If you have this channel, find out when it comes on again and watch it.  If you don't have the channel, go to the site and buy it.  Injustice is not a strong enough word for what happened, and is still happening to these ""boys"".  I don't want to go on a rant about it I just want as many people as possible to see Brandon Hein's web site.  Brandon Hein and Anthony Miliotti are both serving sentences of life without parole for a crime that they didn't commit, didn't know was happening, and could not stop.  PLEASE go to the site and explore.  Don't just take my word for it, see the case with your own eyes.  Be sure to check out the ""voices"" page.  People from all walks of life are supporting these guys.  Names like:  Alan Dershowitz, Dr. Jeffrey Fagan and Charles Grodin to name a few of the more famous ones.  
If you are as moved by the story as I was, take a moment to sign the petition.  It only takes a few seconds... compare that to the 11+ years these kids have been sitting in jail!!!  If you would rather have the ""short version"" of the story, just click the <i>60 Minutes II - ""Life In Prison: Felony Murder""</i> link on the right side of the home page.  PLEASE take a look and maybe post the link in your journal as well.

""Talking Dog for Sale.""

He rings the bell and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard.

The guy goes into the backyard and sees a Labrador retriever sitting
there.

""You talk?"" he asks.

""Yep,"" the Lab replies.

""So, what's your story?""

The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I
was pretty young, and I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA
about my gift, and in no time at all, they had me jetting from country
to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no
one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most
valuable spies for eight years running. But the jetting around really
tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I wanted to
settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover
security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening
in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of
medals. I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.""

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for
the dog.

""Ten dollars."" The guy says.

""This dog is amazing. Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?""

""Because he's a liar. He didn't do any of that shit."""

I said I stopped, I didn't say I finished.  When I got home from work today I started again. (At 6:30)  I finished at 7:30.  4 fucking hours to mow less than a 1/2 acre of grass.  Why so long you ask?  Well let me tell you...I was using an electric lawn mower and every 5 minutes or so it would clog and trip the circuit breaker.  The very best part is that the mower doesn't have a bag so I had to rake the lawn when I was done.(I only raked 1/2 though)  My arms hurt so bad right now.  The lawn is making me lower my standards too.  Since dumping my ex, I have dreamed of a hot guy who will be good to me and my girls.  Now, I'll settle for a geek with a good gas mower.

I want to take some time to tell you about a kid I know named Grant Austin Taylor.  He's just your typical 9 year old.  He's in 4th grade, (He's in Amber's class) he doesn't like school very much, he's really quite shy, and he's not into chicks yet. (Though they are WAY into him) Oh, one more thing, Grant is an AMAZING singer/songwriter/guitar player.  I have often refered to Grant as having a split personality.  The shy little boy I see when I sometimes pick Amber up from school is a far cry from the rocker I see on stage during a performance.  PLEASE, do yourself a favor and go to his site (A link will follow) and watch a video or two.(Or 15) Feel free to comment, as Grant loves to hear what people/fans have to say about his music.  Just say Amber's mom sent ya. While you are there, check out the calendar.  All his band's upcoming performances are listed.  If you can make it to a show, I swear you will not regret it.  The Grant Austin Taylor Band is opening up for Better Than Ezra at the Chesapeake Jubilee on May 21st.  If you can make it, I will see you there.

EDIT:  If you know more people than me, and most of you do, PLEASE copy the above info and post it in your journal.  This kid is truly an amazing artist and deserves any and all recognition he can get, so please spread the word!!!  Thanks."

I can't say enough good things about this show.  The first time I saw it I was hooked.  If you can catch an episode you should.  Dr. House, played by Hugh Laurie is great.  Just do yourself a favor and watch it."

"event","First off, thanks to all who wished me a happy birthday.  It was, however, one of the worst I've had.  Yes, it was worse than when my mom forgot my 18th birthday.  Yes, it was worse than when, on my 30th birthday, my ex wished me a happy 29th birthday.  Wanna know why it was so bad?  Well screw you I need to vent so I am gonna tell you anyway.
1. It took us 11 hours to get home.  
2. <u>MY</u> total gas bill for the trip was $120.
3. Some fucknut driving down I95 had drywall tied to his roof and it apparently fell off.  I was in one of the center lanes and could not avoid running over it.  It broke the floodlight and the bumper of the car.  MY SISTER'S CAR!!!  
4. I found out my insurance won't cover it.

Before anyone asks, no I didn't get fucknut's plate number.  We didn't think it did any damage to the car and didn't find out it had until about 2 hours later when we stopped. Plus, he was about 1 mile ahead, pulled over fixing the ropes the held the drywall on the truck.  I feel SO fucking bad.  My sister loaned me her car and I mucked it up.  I know it wasn't my fault, but it is my responsibility. Everyone keeps saying there was nothing I could do, but I still feel horrible.  

To top it all off, ""the bitch"" comes back to work tomorrow.  I didn't get a call that her plane crashed or that she was shot during a mugging, so my birthday wish didn't come true either.  All in all it was a VERY shitty birthday.  

Well, I have taken 4 tylenol and my back will not stop screaming at me so I guess I am gonna go lay on the heating pad.  I hope everyone had a better weekend than me."

"event","I am so loving this week at work.  The office is so much happier when ""the bitches"" are gone.  Maybe their plane will crash or the casino they are in will collapse.  Even better, maybe someone will just off them for fun.  

Don't bother commenting on how I am gonna burn in hell cause you will be wasting your time.  If I'm gonna burn, it will prolly be for the ""Jesus does porn movies"" conversation I had with <lj user=""grooviegirl"">, not for wishing two cunts would get what's coming to them.

I just finished watching tonights episode of House M.D.  OMG it was great.  I am a little nervous that House is gonna have a romance though.  Why must they ruin every show with mushy crap??  He is too in love with himself to have a relationship, and that's the way I like it.  Seriously, it is a great show.

I gave Hailey a bath tonight and she didn't crap in the tub. (She has the last 2 times.) I learned my lesson and waited till she made her evening ""deposit"" and then I put her in the tub.  Yea for learning from your mistakes.

I need a car adapter for my laptop so Amber can watch DVD's on the trip up to PA this weekend.  I went to dell.com to get it.  I couldn't find it online so I called the sales dept.and they found it for me. It won't ship for 11 days.  I got it anyway.  The woman on the phone tried to sell me more memory.  I ever so gently told her to fuck off.

I got Amber's school pics today. She looks so grown up in them.  It makes me want to cry.  I can't believe she's going to be 10 in September.  

I think I am developing an unhealthy obsession for Edward Norton.  I had a dream about him last night.  My alarm went off just as he was about to enter the ""love tunnel"". (one for your list, <lj user=""dvnmsm"">) I was pissed.  Even in dreams I can't have good sex.  

Thanks to breast feeding, my boobs look great.  Too bad my ass looks like Texas.  

I gotta go to bed now.  Night all!!"

"event","I took the kids to the zoo today.  As you walk in, there are 4-6 fountains surrounding a huge marble ball made to look like earth.  Kids (adults too) are allowed to play in the fountains.  Just in front of the whole set-up is a sign that reads: Shirt and shoes required.  Upon reading this Amber turns to me and says: ""Mom, can I take off my pants?  The sign says shirt and shoes required, but it doesn't say anything about pants.  So... can I?""
Later, while we were watching the bison, Amber noticed some trash on the inside of the fence.  ""Mom, why do people litter?  Is it because they are stupid or did no one ever tell them it was wrong?""  Just then a woman and her SIX KIDS came up to the fence.  One of them, a boy about 10-12 years old dropped a piece of trash on the ground.  Amber sprung into action.  ""Pick that up.  You can't litter here.  The wind could blow that onto the other side of the fence and the bison could choke on it.  Shesh, there's a trash can right behind you.""  The mother glared at me and I turned to fully face her and said ""She's right.""  The boy picked up the trash and threw it into the trash can.  I was so proud of Amber that I HAD to buy her some Dippin Dots... twice.
This was Hailey's first trip to the zoo and she had a great time.  Her favorite part was seeing the squirrel monkeys.  They came right up to the glass and said hi.  She screamed with delight.  After the zoo, we went to a park and put Hailey on the baby swing.  She LOVED it.  Each time the swing would come toward me she would scream.  I got some great pics and I will post a few soon. 
That was the best Sunday I've had in a long time. I hope everyone sleeps well.  I think I might since ""the bitch"" and ""bitch jr."" are both on vacation next week.  Woo hoo!!  Should be an awsome week.  Peace"

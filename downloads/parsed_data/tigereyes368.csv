"event","i'm not quite sure at what point i would have realized how comfortable, safe and routine my life has become if it weren't for facebook updates. every day we read about people we're friends with.. or ""friends"" with and all that they're doing. something as simple as what theyre doing for the day, what theyre doing in weeks, marriage, and deaths. its crazy how one minute i'll be okay. i log on to facebook. scroll down a couple lines and then feel completely and utterly disgusted with myself and all that i havent accomplished. i keep telling myself that i have one year to work and then its grad school. i find out a friend is now currently enrolled and i havent even picked up a paint brush since may. i feel guilty sure, and there are days i want to paint however i havent. even my own mother said 'i know you and if you wanted to paint you would find a way and you havent yet' 
what is it that we somehow lose that high we used to get from the things we used to love doing?
i know i dont want to work retail for the rest of my life. that much im sure of. i dont know if i can have painting for a income.. or my main source of income is what i should specify. im not sure if i want it as my main source to begin with.
i cant even count how many hours ive spent complaining or venting to my boyfriend about what to do, what i can do and how to do it or where to go. he tells me all the things i know and yet i still do nothing. even now im laying here with my heart pounding out of my chest because i dont know where the time has gone since may and i have nothing to show for myself. a year is going to fly by and all ive done is take it day by day. worrying about what bill to pay what i can save and what can i buy with my next paycheck just for momentary happiness. yes im a consumer whore- im fine with the fact that i like to have nice things. i just wish i had spent all that time online window shopping for grad schools or ideas for projects rather than items to potentially buy.

not quite sure where i was going with this. but i do need to make some ground rules for myself and i figure if i write it down then i cant go back on it or push it to a further due date."

just as i was getting back to my usual state of crazy antics i could feel all that i went through from the last three months come crashing back to me.. i thought i left that passive self behind me. 

i can slowly feel myself dying a bit inside. ..like everything has just slowed down and ive just come to accept to settle with all thats mediocre.. like im stranded out in the ocean from a bad undertoe and the current just weakens me to the point that it feels better to give up and be completely overwhelmed by the water than to fight it. 

 i think i need to get out of this town, out of this state, and out of this country and find myself before i completely drown..

"event","so i spent a the past weekend in montreal, canada with the ballet crew and a couple other cool guys. 


*im warning you now if you dont feel like reading a long ramble of my trip then dont.. this is for my own recording cause i want to remember my first time out of the country and my first trip without the rents.. so go roll ya eyes somewhere else.


it all began friday night right after the first pas de deux class.. which was hell. then packed up two cars of luggage and 8 bodies in two cars. 6 hours later filled with coffee, havana nights soundtrack, deer and fog we finally made it to canada. we crashed that night cause it was def 3 in the am. 

the next day, we scoped out the scenes and went shopping on st. catherine's st. best strawberries and cream crepes ever! then later that day we went to the hard rock cafe for dinnah.. mmm sangria. sooo delicious. before we crashed early that night instead of hittin up the club we went to some crappy strip club.. considering it was my first time going to one.. i still think i could do a better job. def ask me to do my imitation of sexy chanel.. after doing her crap routine and us makin fun a bit for something being stuck up her butt she came over and introduced herself.. ""hi where are you guys from?"" everyone looks at me. . ""im from massachusetts and the rest are from rhode island"" (shes shaking our hands) ""thats cool.. you know i do girls on girls, boys and girls and boys and boys you know.. dont be shy.."" everyone uncomfortably laughs.. ewwww. i almost wanted to throw up my 9 dollar beer. but i figured id keep it down for the sake of spending 9 bucks plus tip. but it was good for a laugh needless to say. so at this point im pretty much sober yet manage to walk right into a trash can.. and continue to trip over it. my excuse is that i was looking behind me talking to john so i didnt see it. so a whole group of gorgeous boys were standing off to the side and saw the whole thing. everyones cracking up including myself and someone yelled out that i had too much to drink which caused everyone i was with to laugh harder cause they knew i didnt drink enough and was sober. it was pretty funny. and it def lost something while typing it.

then that sunday we engorged ourselves with the best breakfast ever. seriously we didnt eat until 6 hours later that day. mmm crepes, omelets, waffles and the best coffee ever. it was better than any sex ive ever had. s e r i o u s l y.

later on sunday after star bucks liz, holly, joe, shane, fusco and fuscos brother went to the casino and old montreal with nothing there apparently while me and amanda went shopping again.. got the coolest shirts from french connection.. one shirt that says ""hot as fcuk"" and ""best fcuk there is"".. then a skull and cross bones shirt that says ""im a pretty poison"" from buffalo. just one more shirt for my growing collection. ooh then went to la senza (apparently canadians dont have a victorias secret.. they have la senza instead) so i got some good deals and bought some pretty bras and a couple tanks.. i sorta felt like i was betraying v.s. but pretty lingerie for cheap is just clutch. im so proud of me and amanda though.. we went the whole day by ourselves without getting lost. yay us!

made a friend with the pool boy called vladamir.. hahaha. i just liked saying his name.. and he just liked my skull and cross bones sweat pant capris. and that i didnt pronounce my r's.. and i didnt want his cookies unlike amanda.

after dinnah at some steak house and several long islands we went out scouting for clubs.. we eventually went to one that was empty. so it was pretty cool we had our own private club for a bit. but that got old so we went down to peel pub and got smashed. the waiter recognized the crew from earlier and gave us free shots.. i stunned john for tellin secrets to josh.. and somehow he stunned me back and we ended up on the floor. for whatever reason in all the pictures taken at the bar im stickin my tongue out .. and walking back i held hands with john.. eh? and amanda blew raspberries to herself cause she couldnt feel her lips and wanted everyone to do it too. or so im told. we got the boys to pose in front of the church to imitate pachel bell (spelling?). . .very cool. and then 6 long islands, two shots of vodka, sangria, wine and a couple breezers in my system i managed to rip my jeans right on the crotch while jeteing with the girls down the hotels hall then we got yelled at by the manager. whoops. 

went to bed round 4ish.. the tv there after hours is nuts.. talk about soft porn.

woke up and drove back home.. we stopped in vermont to get some grub.. and there was def a cockroach. the lady yelled at us cause we ""partied all weekend and dont know what we ordered"" even though they goofed up the orders.. and they got double pissed when shane turned around and yelled out the quote of hte weekend ""its quite fancy here isnt it?"" and then we later told the old bitch manager about the bug on the floor she kicked it and told us it was a bumble bee..amanda ""thats disgusting"" me: ""but the ""bumble"" bee doesnt have yellow stripes."" then the old bat of a manager told amanda to pick it up if she didnt like it. hahahahaha. so we left and grabbed some wendys instead.. at least they dont leave their dead roaches in the doorway. 

but overall i had such a good time and i def want to go again.. maybe not montreal cause its wicked touristy.. but canada is so beautiful im thinking on living there when i get older. all i can think of is a cleaner and more beautiful new york.. and the people are nicer. thats a plus.


mmm thats about it for canada.. pictures will follow cause there were def some good ones.

aight sorry for it being so long. but deal.

- even though i rarely worked because good ol viki secret is effin me over with hours, it let me spend time with some people that i normally dont get to.

got to watch hook thanks to one cool cat which totally topped my tuesday nite besides other things.

mmhmm. 

though i wish i would stop over thinking things.. because i just cant figure things out. and im just nervous of somethings done and said that could or did happen and cant be reversed back to the way it was before. 

i hate humans for being allowed so many emotions. honestly it just fucks everything up.


- i miss school for once. well, not really the b.s. of busy work but i do miss some people that i met this year already. i miss the late nights spent with the suite k girls both weber and thorpe. 


- the wine tasting fund raiser is coming up and im very nervous cause we're dancing outside on a hill.. not to mention i had a hard enough time controllin my turn and jumps in my solo on a flat surface now i get to struggle a downward slant with ruts. but at least i get to wear my ruby red tutu again with that sweet ass tiara.. then a quick change for paco bell cannon. yea im very nervous about it cause its my first time performing it and i only got to learn it in 3 rehearsals.. f u c k m e.


- cant wait for head automatica coming in a couple of weeks! yayayayayayay.. and i thank jenny k and justin for introducing me to that band. (credit was due) then after that theres action action playing.


- thinkin about changing my hair style.. need suggestions ;)

- sorry for the lame post.. i thought my week was more interesting than that.
wait i forgot.. the ""foam party"" woot. woot. nah it was a good time though.. saw a lot of familiar faces good times good times.

so school is really sucking the life out of me.

. drawing 2

. design 1

. intermed. ballet

. writing 100

. core 4 children of the world

on top of that..

. dance mon, wed, fri, and soon sundays

. work thurs, fri, sat and sundays until rehearsals kick in.

it wouldnt be so bad if it werent for all the ""outside assignments"" for both art classes.. i think its one thing to assign a project or homework.. but both is just nuts (and its in both classes). i cant seem to get it all in. its like they want to make you choose their art or other aspects of your life. i cant choose art every time. i dont know how everyones does it. it seems like something always has to suffer.

anywho.. 

i have a stalker in both of my core 4 and writing class (which they are on opposite days so i get to see him everyday.. yippie).. its weird because i know ive had a class with him from a previous semester and i cant remember which class it was but i know for sure that i never talked to him or gave him any inclination that i was into him. in writing we have to sit in a circle and somehow he always manages to sit across from me and hes always doing this creepy smile thing or winks.. or just plain stares.. its really obvious because erin has noticed it and so has the girls next to me. maybe i wouldnt mind if he was remotely cute.. but hes not. he looks like one of those garbage patch kid dolls.. hes so freakish looking. oh and to top it off.. he picked me to be his partner in this cooperation game where we had to throw a ball around the room and say the persons name.. etc. he said my name so creepily. - shivers - yuckies.

umm.. so yea 

valentines day is coming up. whoppedy-fuckin-do.
-sigh- whatever. its a just a pathetic excuse for girls to get stupid junk from their boyfriends and then complain about if it wasnt expensive enough. 

so since my computer crashed a while back.. i lost the ability to watch dvds.. so i thought i would be all smart and download the software etc. yea still no go.. i know i dont have any software at home.. so if anyone has power play or something useful do drop a line ;) much appreciated.

it looks like i wont be going to see chevelle after all.. word is that its sold out. fuck beans. this is just one shit ass day. *correction, i just called lupos and the girl said there were plenty of tix.. booyes.

speaking of shows.. im pretty sure im going to see atmosphere in march with dan.. im pretty excited but anxious as well. dont ask but lately ive been getting nervous over the most stupidest shit. yea im pretty lame like that.

so dance is going exceptionally well to my surprise.. i just need to get toned and work out more.. will i .. probably not but the intention is there. i keep saying once the weather gets better/ no more snow/ice on the sidewalks im going to start running. that should be a pretty site. mmmjust kidding. 

i really need to be doing my art projects/ outside assignments of 48 muscle journal, 2 collages, 3 skeleton portraits, 3 skull portraits, dynamic line design and get art supplies.

so im going to attempt to do something productive..

long time no write.

well a lot of shit has happened. pretty much dont want to relive all of it either by writing it all down but youre more than welcome to ask and i'll share. but roughly..

- working like a bastard. like over 40 hours a week, and dont even ask me how its possible to work 8 days a week but ive managed to do it.

- christmas was extremely good.. i got the coolest gift ever. an ipod. nough said. and my mom proved to me that she actually listens to my babble cause she bought me donnie darko. among other things she bought me a chevelle cd which i already owned. two years in a row shes tried and i had already bought it. haha she punched me in the arm when i told her and we had a fit of laughing. my dad was completely lost in the whole situation. i wonder if third time will be the charm?

- my grandmother from florida came up for a couple weeks and stayed with us.. i got kicked out of my room which wasnt so bad except every morning i got to hear the irish whisper of mimi. drove me effin buts but i gotta love her just for the same loud whisper of dirt during family functions. 

- new years was nothing special worked like usual and stayed in for the big family get-together. it was nice actually.. well better than the year before so i cant complain.

- no new years resolutions for me. thats my resolution. i think i can actually keep this one.

- im back dancing.. and i couldnt feel my ass for a couple days.

- i got the insurance money for the car accident.. and surprise surprise, theyre not giving me enough to cover the cost of a new bumper and paint job to match the car and manual work, because volvo are ass raping me every time i take my car to the dealer. mother 'effers.

- did i mention work has me working like a slave? i mean at least the slaves got housing and meals included into the deal. cripes, i have to drive there, waste gas, bring my own meals which i forget to do every time, and deal with ignorant nail technicians from wal-mart. i swear to god i wish i had a video camera because no one believes my stories. i think the face masks they wear arent doing enough, or the nail chemicals are seeping into their skin or something.. cause they are one effed up group of people. 

- semi annual sale owns me. all i have to say is i have a lot of pretty stuff and no one to show. its usually the way, but i dont care cause i got it cheap.

- i need to see some people and go to some shows and savers extravagansas cause im over due. hint hint jenny k, dave, dan and shan :)

- im very upset with myself.. i havent seen any of the movies that are out in the theaters, no trips to boston or ny like planned, or any other plans that were made and somehow havent happened.

- the good news i got housing at ric for the semester so i dont have to worry about trekking my ass for 8's everyday in the shitty weather.. cause we all know how great r.i. drivers are. i just have to drop off the deposit and from there i will be able to know which dorm im at. lets just say there will be a celebration of freedom all are welcome.

- hot tub = god.. thats my one reason to come home now.. that and to use the washer and dryer.

- i quit smoking. for good. im serious this time. 

- i cant even remember what ive wrote up to this point..

- feb. 26 chevelle and helmet is coming to lupos. very exciting. maybe it will turn into a tradition if theres a couple more shows within the years.. that would be cool. maybe i can spit my water back onto sam like he did to me last year. jerk. haha.

- thats about it. have to be into work in less than 6 hours or so. fuckin a. (and yes i did watch clerks and chasing amy back to back)

- do watch big bad love. its silly.

- club scene on friday night with the girls. should be interesting non the least.

whats up with this - thing. needs to stop. haha.

thats right.. its the consequences of working at the mall. i cant help it, he didnt look 15.. i can just see it now.. ""but he was a very matured looking 15 year old officer."" 
i mean what kid that age has facial hair?! ah-ha, at least i can laugh about it now before im in the back of a cruiser for statutory rape. if only he was a year older, haha gross no.

anyways, other than hitting on all the toddlers things seem okay i guess. 

went shopping and got a few cute things with erin. then went to sallys and bought some fun stuff to play with.. aka, acrylic. yes, i now have fake nails that i did myself.. they came out pretty good. im very proud of myself. now i dont have to ever subject myself to being made fun of by those crappy ass sweat shop nail salons. erin's however came off this morning.. haha they came off with hot water, which sucks cause that was like a good three hours of learning, messing up and finally screwing up royally.

enough sounding valley.. time to get back to my nerdy self..

anyone know how to operate soul seek.. i know its dummy proof, but its a lot different to what im used to and i just need a quick and painless crash course. 
dammit i just want some good music non mainstream for once.

do make a point and rent 'harold and maude' fan-fucking-tastic.

'nuff said. :)</P>
<P>i watched <U>basic instinct</U> for the first time the other night. all i have to say is.. holy shit. haha, and i thought <U>fatal attraction</U> was pretty hot.. no no i was wrong, dead wrong. granted there were some total girl on girl action, yea not so hot and that whole uncrossing of the legs at the station was uncalled for, but the fact that the character was so ballsy was pretty cool. ""you can't smoke in here."" ""what are you going to do, charge me for smoking?"" </P>
<P>while on the topics of movies.. i went to the library and rented <U>harold and maude</U>, one of my top favorites.. and i highly recommend it, and <U>north by northwest</U>, a hitchcock film.. we watched only part of it in film and that was it so i thought it looked pretty cool and why not see the rest. :)</P>
<P>oh and speaking of bitch ass librarians.. they still havent gotten back to me on the whole arthur nersesian book, yet have a gazzillion of <U>bridget jones diary</U>. seriously, how many copies do you really need, but you cant find me one book. lame ass library.</P>
<P>so art seems to be going fairly well.. portfolio is due tues and i have to go back to the green house to finish my drawing and maybe do another one if i have someone there to talk to because if not i get a bit stir crazy in there. so yea, i really like this kid in my art class.. i kinda dont want to admit this but he reminds me so much of an ex, and you guessed it he has the same name. well if not, then im calling him it anyways just because it suits his face/build/character.. whatever you want to call it. he seems like such a sweetheart and hes just starting to come out of his shell a bit around me. and to think all i had to do was compliment his art work.. why didnt i just think of doing that sooner? fricken mastermind right here. ;)<BR>kinda wish i had someone to go to, but other days im glad i dont have anyone to answer to. know what i mean jelly bean? i know the holidays are going to suck, no big surprise there but i just dont want to get into something just because for the sake of not being alone or wanting that comfort. i just need a rental boyfriend.. just when i need someone to go to and get a hug randomly or a long drive thru the back roads (but only during the fall). oh well whatever.</P>
<P>debating on whether or not i should buy a david yurman ring. its pretty pricey, im not going to lie and these next few paychecks are going to be hurting simply because i cut down on my hours.. i figure they cater to everyone else and im the one getting screwed picking up their shitty shifts.. not to mention my homework so i cut back and im still procrastinating with my work.. but just not as bad. go figure. hmm well i figure ive got no one else to spend lots of money on so it might as well be me so i think i just might splurge a paycheck or two, or three on that ring.. depending on the stone they have.</P>
<P>next wed, you can say good bye to the faded black hair of mine.. it will be stripped and dyed back to my natural color.. well as close as it gets anyways. hoo-fucking-hooray. i hate walking around with roots the size of texas and being all faded in just one spot in the back of my head. great, real great looking. so yea hopefully my hair doesnt fall out in the process :) then again with a wig, no fuss no muss. maybe im on to something..</P>

theres still a lot of gaps that need to be cleared a.s.a.p. before it gets dragged out any longer and any ""misconceptions"" and shit like that start happening.

well work sucks.. and i cut down on my hours because im already really behind on my school work.

dance is okay, today was picture day so hopefully when i get the portraits back next saturday maybe i can post one or two just for shits and giggles. :) 

ive noticed ive used the word shit a lot.. im just going to say its the word of the day to excuse the crude language. :)

so dance at ric is really crappy though. the teacher only embarrasses me and these two other people. probably because we're pretty much the only ones with experience? maybe.. i dont know. he stopped class to yell at me for my positioning of my hands. ive never in my life, have been yelled at for something so trivial. i was hoping for better critique but i guess im a bad dancer only due to my hands. 

i havent really talked to anyone or seen anyone since school started. im really feeling the effects of being a commuter. i always feel like im out on the road driving to school, dance, job, or home. seriously its pretty bad. i havent even been to a show in a while.. which im really looking forward to going flogging molly, cant say im a big fan im just glad im getting out and going with some familiar faces and hoping to see a few while im there.
i know its sort of my fault though.. i just need to start calling people. im so bad when it comes to the phone though. honestly i dont think ive had one full conversation with dan on the phone.. we're always playing phone tag with these long elaborate messages. i honestly dont get it.. and hes not the only one thats in the whole phone tag game either.. i just dont get it. 
i need my parents to go away again just so i can invite everyone over just to hang out all at the same time and catch up because this is not acceptable anymore. :(

so many things i want to buy and so little cashola.. 
one thing is for sure im going to buy the chevelle cd before the end of this week. i heard a couple other songs off of the album and it sounds really great. 
there were a couple others that i cant think of besides greenday and re-buying of alkaline trio..hmm. oh well.

movie theater.. ugh one too many movies i want to see to list. its complete and utter craziness.

well im done and feeling pretty lazy so this will do for now.

in a nut shell..

i now know where to pick up some extra change at two in the morning.. even in front of a cop, cause i know he'll just sit in his parked car. so anyone down for a ride to plymouth rock?

saw napolean dynamite.. even though i dont remember most of it, it was so fricken good. i totally plan on seeing it again.

ive acquired a new puppy.. lets just say ive got him on a choke chain and all i did was smile.

quote of wed. night.. ""i dont want to die here.."" while choking on a piece of burger in wendys from laughing so hard because of erin and trying not to pee my pants.. cause no one in that joint probably knew the heimlich. 

bought a hot corset for the all girls night thurs. i think i had a bit too much fun.. but it was way over due. lets just say, theres a reason to why you dance with your back to the guy.. you just dont want to know what they look like. 
highlight of the night was that i got to dance with that hot kid i like though :) and i will be gloating over that for a while. 
but i think i have the top response to the common club question.. guy: ""whats your name?"" me: ""it doesnt matter."" guy: ""haha, yea that it doesnt"" 
..and its true, its true. i mean whats the point, unless you already know me, theres no point in learning more names because its not like theres going to be a number following it. one word. gross.

at dance, i got bumped up from harvest to war. lets just say after five seconds in, i thought i was going to keel down on the floor and die right there because i was so out of breath. the music is so fast and the choreography is so demanding compared to my previous part. im wicked happy about it, but im also really afraid that im going to get hurt because im getting pushed beyond my limits.

got a free orlando bloom poster because my boss went through spencers trash. hahaha. whatever its all good plus it was free-ninety-nine.

at work, i was made the angels bra queen.. haha i sold the most launch bra which was.. 62 angels uplift bras in one week.. more like in four days but oh well. pretty cool. i beat everyone, including my managers. i hope i get a set of those massive angels wings or something other than a pat on the head.

and count down till big american fun night with mg, eg and company and anyone else that wants to go see flogging molly the 30th. :)

there are a ton of movies that look wicked good.. shaun of the dead.. saw.. hero.. and that sky captain one.. if youre down for seeing any of these and got some cashola i'll be your movie whore for the night. :)

and im out..

now i can now see why most of the people had these awful mean looking faces.. its because of the parking lots, well lack of i should say. and to think a cop walks in the middle of the road while im turning and looks at me like im the asshole. i think not. hmm, lets think about this.. big heavy machinery (aka volvo) and human being. im sorry but i think the car just might win.. so needless to say dont fuck with me while im driving and i havent had a cup of coffee. :)

well already skipped one of my classes.. oops. haha i missed art so that means no class for a full week. sweetness. so me and erin went to the mall and got b-day gifts for matt. 

hmm i took a statistic in my english class in between staring at this one kid.. haha, yea anyways.. my teacher said the word 'uhh/umm' 194 times.. i kid you not. and then he said ""saddling the ass"" from the bible.. and im sure you know how mature i can be so of course i chuckled.. how can you not? good ol' bible, always good for a laugh.

b o r e d

parents are away starting this very moment.. matter of fact they should be entering new hampshire right now. thank god.. and they wont be back until sunday night i believe. so party hardy? i think so. might be going to a club tonight.. woah! yup you read right. haha yea me at clubs dont happen too often but im in the mood for some dancing and needless groping. ;)
so that should be fun? after work.. which sucks cause im going home right after class, then work till close and then out. and go back to work tomorrow to open. yuck.

"event","so how about me being non existent in the lj world. crazy.

over all.. schools back in session and i already see some bumps in the road. as far as my classes go.. i only see philosophy/aesthetics going to be my only real problem.. other than that i can bullshit everything else fairly well. so heres the low down.

aesthetics - i have a trent reznor in my class.. majorly hot, until his chest hair was growing out of his half buttoned shirt. all i wanted to do was reach over and button that baby up. not that i have anything against body hair but it was just a distracting jungle over there. to make matters worse, hes moved closer to me, and his shirts have gotten more revealing. (makes a gagging face)

art - my teacher is a complete and utter blow-ass. he doesnt teach, he just draws it and expects me to understand how he got it to look the way it did. and if i ask him a question he just talks in circles and leaves me without an answer. 

film - i am completely and utterly in love with this class.. minus the fact that my professor is so nerdy hot. honestly i didnt think there were this many people that were in love with movies like myself. and the hot kid next to me completely agreed with me on the whole requiem for a dream ruling. and i totally recomended secretary to my teacher without thinking. hes like.. oh ive never heard of it.. i'll have to rent it over the weekend. wont he be in a nice surprise.

ballet - okay i dont like the teacher simply because he's worked with my company before and he totally thinks hes some hot shit. his techniques of teaching are a lot better than his dancing so thats a plus and the only real downfall of the class is that he publicly embarrasses you. i hate that more than anything. plus side.. i made a friend :) its his first dance class.. he was so cute and awful. i mean even i screwed up a lot, but he did really good for his first time. i was joking around with him afterwords and we got to talking. he lives with his parents too so i dont feel like such a dork. unfortunately he doesnt go to our school somehow.. i dont know the real details.. something about how hes not really in college but is taking classes for the time being.. eh. go figure.

english - heres the doosey of the five. my professor feels the need to put the word ""uhhhhhhhh"" in between everything. and he has a wicked funny name.. grund. hehe. but honestly he would talk and then these long pauses of uhh and then talk again and then uhhh. me and shan were cracking up.. and to make matters worse we were sitting in a circle so everyone could see that we were laughing everytime. and not to mention we're reading the holy bible. umm last i knew i was attending a public college.. mmmyea. im so lost right now cause ive been to church all of three times in my life. its sad to say i only know what i know because of the movie 'ten commandments' with hesston.. and i refuse to buy a bible just for class and we dont own one. whoops. and i totally made an ass out of myself with the cute kid before class today but what else is new. 

.. so im noticing a trend with myself or so its been pointed out to me .. whats up hot guys and glasses? 

yea so schools great other than running into people that i said i would call over the summer and hang out. i feel like such a jackass with some people and get over it pretty quickly with others. i miss summer already.. and i knew it was quickly comming to an end when the king arthurs fair ads are up. one word when i see those... f u c k.

just a few more weeks till chevelles cd comes out.. i cant wait. ive been waiting for it for so long.. and they just released their single on air. i really like it.. i mean it sounds like something off of their last album but heavier.. along with their other stuff.. but i still cant wait. theyve already posted their tour and the closest theyre coming is pa and ny. all i have to say is road trip cause theyre worth the gas money live.

i got to see some familiar faces tonight on unfortunate terms. my deepest sympathies go out to j.t and a.t.. i love you guys both.

tired.
sore.

school starts monday.. and guess what.. ive got zip. looks like i'll be scrounging up some pens and napkins from my car for class. :)

cirque du soleil was completely amazing. thats one circus i want to runaway with. from the costumes to the makeup.. its so breathtaking. i wish i was that talented so i could at least try out. maybe i could just get a desk job? but that means moving to canada.. which doesnt sound like a bad idea after all.

so sunday me and erin went to the cheapo depo movie theater and saw 'raising hellen'.. well, im getting ahead of myself.. we get there and there are these three kids sitting there and we're trying to decide what to see.. so its raising hellen and we get in line. one of the kids gets up and buys a ticket right after us. so we're sitting in the theater, enjoying our free finds of candy, and yes it was delicious. any who.. you guessed it the three guys sat right behind us. one of them scared me when he asked me a question. i cant believe them.. ask ugly as they were (totally hickdacious) i give them credit for sitting through a chic flick.. i mean i was getting antsy trying to watch it. so they talked to us after the movie and we blew them off as nicely as we could. i mean it was past their bed time.. i wouldnt want to be responsible for keeping them out late. hahaha no.
so we went back to her house.. tried to come up for some plans on friday but failing miserably.. and made chicken quesadeas. it was scrumscious.

this cold is still kicking my ass.. well sorta. work is always freezing so it isnt helping. tea and tissues are always welcomed :)

so no word on housing. one word. fuck. 
this cant be good. but hopefully i'll get it sometime later this quarter.

so i watched an amazing film from the seventies.. its called soylent green. i highly recomend it.

thursday.. i dont care, im going to the living room after work. hopefully i can leave work a tad early just so i can change and what not.

alright im out.. the movie 'tape' is going to be on again.. :) 

night.

""anyway, you cant scare her.. shes sleeping with prince valium""

p.s. i just found out joseph mazzell, the kid from 'radio flyer' was the prom date in 'raising hellen'.. aww he grew up and got cute. i had the biggest crush on that kid. mmm hmm. i was wondering who that kid was. ;)"

<P>and to top off being in the house.. im sick. i wonder why? and i have no gas.. so i dont know how im going to get to work tomorrow because i really really dont have any gas in the tank and i had to miss two very good opportunities because of it too. boo to that.</P>
<P>shans back from canada.. and got me a sweet ass nosferatu poster. i think i just might boycott putting up a picture just to lure unsuspecting boys into my room. ;) nahh, who am i kidding.. i just have to find a picture cause im too lazy to find the cord to connect the computer to the camera.</P>
<P><BR><IMG height=425 src=""http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/MG/144231.jpg"" width=275 border=0></P>

<P>so i ended up not working after all on friday.. boo. but i ended up going to ric with erin to apply for some jobs n' stuff. i must say im really looking forward to going back even though im still on the waiting list for house. <BR>all i have to say about that is.. s h i t .. i really dont think im going to survive living with my parents. its bad enough they still have a hold on me.. its only going to get worse. i can just imagine it all ready.. ""where do you think you're going.. you have school in the morning.."" just like high school all over again. <BR>fucking sweet. <BR>no, not so much.</P>
<P>but i did run into my favorite person in the library.. dan the man. ah-ha. no it was totally weird seeing how i havent talked to him since the begining of break.. and i wonder why. -sigh- oh god..memories.<BR>haha, erin turned to me and said ""i thought you hated him.. i mean didnt he yelled at you at freshman orientation?"" we just laughed just thinking about how much destructive stuff i wanted to do to him for embarrassing me.. go figure, now we're friends. so i was supposed to call him over the weekend.. but you know what.. the phone works both ways.. and i hate calling boys. call me old fashioned. or the fact that i hate talking on the phone. it could go either way. </P>
<P>so yea. being sick sucks. and i have to get my wisdom teeth out before school. dont ask me how this is supposed to work seeing how we're going back in 15 days and counting.. yea, sucks.</P>
<P>gonna go pass out.</P>
<P>""you know... every week i come in here and i tell you stuff... and its embarrassing. i tell you stuff that i dont tell anyone else... and you know what? its your turn, dr. thurman. im not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.""<BR>""..i once had an extended sexual fantasy involving mr. rogers."" <BR>-&gt; thats for justin</P>
<P>p.s. the days.. is so good.<BR></P>"

"event","so today was pretty unusual..


bad news one:
i woke up to find a note in the kitchen.. 
""peggy, i've gone to the hospital.. aunty took me. im o.k. i got into an accident at the barn. give aunty a call if you want. love mom.""

i was like what the fuck.. i had to re-read it a couple times just because i thought it was some sick joke.. then i saw my moms car in the driveway and i didnt hear her laughing to herself after i called her name out frantically. so i called my aunt and shes like.. ""yea we're at roger williams, your mom was riding the horse and it spooked.. she fell off and it stepped on her leg and crushed her hand.. she needs stitches.. but i have to go right now.""

so i call my dad frantically.. then i get off the phone cause there was someone ringing the doorbell. so i ran to my room to cover up cause i was in a tank top and boy shorts.. not the greatest way to meet and greet. so come to find out it was my moms friend from work.. and i told her and she just cringed with grossedoutness. apparently my mom called out sick this morning.. and ironically now shes ""sick"" then later i found out amandas nephew fell down the stairs while she went to pick him up for a day out and she called out sick today too. coincidence?

so my aunt called again and told me the deal and they came home like 2 hours later. so i went and got the prescriptions filled and my mom told me that she ran into my doctor.. after they got to talking my doctor said something about going to college.. and my mom replied.. im the mother.. holy shit. i mean i know me and my mom look alike but even my own doctor couldnt tell us apart. fecking weid. 

bad news number two/a: i found out my neighbor died and today was the wake. 
bad news number two/b: she died of cancer.

this will be death number 3 cancer related for the past couple of months.. not years mind you.

im fucking sick of this cancer shit. i really wish i was smarter so i could go to med. school and find a way to beat it.

talked to erin on the phone for a while.. then called up maegan.. shes not doing so good. i feel bad because i kind of fell off the face of the earth to most of my friends.. but oh well the phone works both ways. i wished she was feeling better so she could of came with me but theres always other concerts.. i miss hanging out with her and seeing how shes not dancing im lacking in a partner in crime there. no more mischief backstage at roberts aud. anymore.. and my favorite backstage hand crew dude graduated. boo. now how am i supposed to get distracted while warming up? :(

then got ready fredy to go to the concert! met up with jenn, beth, mike and justin. :) good times. good music. good food. good friends. bad rent-a-cops. missed montys fan club and caught most of midtown. i didnt think they were that bad but oh well. lots of goth kids.. pig pile. lots of random fliers now take up space on my car floor. 
it was great seeing a lot of kids that would never have been there at the concert until they were told the music is good and the thing to do now. i hate people that try too hard from my home town. :) i was so excited to hear ""last ride home"" haha. sorry mike i had to. but even better they played my favorite song ""shinobi vs. dragon ninja"" :) 
then headed into the mall and got something to eat. so jenn and i pushed the tables together so we could all sit together.. then a rent-a-cop came over and made us put the tables back. so whatever.. we're all sitting around and the cop came back around and knocked on the table mike and i were sitting at.. okay weird. so mike gets up to get some ice cream and the cop came back and told me ""you know you look just like the girl from evanescence"" so i said thank you, ""damn you really do."" so i said thank you again.. granted im trying to smile and just take the compliment without looking creeped out.. so he said ""it was a compliment"" all i have to say is what the fuck i said thank you twice.. do you want an autograph or something?! haha.. justin, jenn and beth looked wicked confused to what they just witnessed.. so mike came back and i just got done telling him what happened.. and the cop came back and walked in-between the tables and touched my shoulder. fucking gross. im sorry but there was plenty of room that he didnt need to touch my shoulder. then i went to get my parking ticket validated.. and he came around and crossed paths so he could wave good bye. ugh.

still trying to find the name of that anime show. stupid n.c. didnt have it and now im stuck. i just might have to call the kid i babysit for because he was the one that got me into in the first place.. hmm.

then sat in tons o' traffic trying to get out of the mall.. so i found my old school tape of minor threat while waiting and rocked out by my self.. and got totally caught by a car full of guys while i was rocking out. yea. :) go me.

alright im done..
and degrassi is on. 
*shakes head. i cant believe im into this show. fricken jail bait like woah.

piece out.

""and as for the whole gang-bang scenario... it just couldnt happen. smurfs are asexual. they probably dont even have reproductive organs down there under those little white pants."" 


-> e d i t :
* mike, after re-reading a many posts, i finally found it.. ""m.d. guiest"" = the coolest and supposedly goriest anime movie ever. (at least for its time anyways)"

"event","ive seen two of the best movies in a while..

moonlight mile with my two favorite actors.. dustin hoffman and jake gyllenhaal. jake plays a young man who lingers in the family home of his fiancee, after her accidental death. while grieving along with her parents and drawn into legal issues presented by a district attorney seeking justice for the family, he finds himself falling in love with another woman, against his own best intentions.

and dead ringers with jeremy irons. its basically about the mantle brothers are both doctors - both gynecologists - and identical twins. mentally however, one of them is more confident than the other, and always manages to seduce the women he meets. when he's tired of his current partner, she is passed on to the other brother - without her knowing. it gets a lot creepier than the description ;)


question.. 
since when did alkaline trio start getting played on mtv?
all of a sudden im like what the hell, that sounds like a.t.. but its tv.. surer than shit it was them. weird, i never thought id see them get air time.

and i have to laugh at papa roach. i was really into infest back in the day, lost interest after love, hate, tragedy. and now after watching their newest video.. i have to laugh. colby is wearing eye makeup (not that its a bad thing, because oddly enough there are some guys that look exceptionally hot with it on.. but not him) and hes wearing distressed jeans with paint splatters and already ripped holes. ive lost some respect for him. *shakes head from side to side. poor musicians, theyre so lost.

going to see cirque du solei next week! im so excited.. i watched the series of the making of variki and now im going to see it in person. total sweetness.

so that kid i met at the gas station.. mmyea. hes called me like 6 times since i met him.. and im not kidding. the first time was oh so wonderful. he was hanging out with his friend and felt the need to repeatedly say jokingly to his friend ""why you keep showing me pictures of my ex dude."" just like that too. i almost wish i was kidding. i really wanted to say okay, i get it, youre not taken so end of story. everytime hes called i just let him go. ugh. just hope i dont run into him tomorrow. and speaking of which..

mmmyea. cant wait for tomorrow. and its gonna be rain free or im going to hurt that certain someone who jinxed it.. and believe me, i will do something about it if im not listening to some good free music. enough said. 

i think i was given the best compliment.. i lust for you attitude as much as your body. thats pretty hot. too bad nothing will ever come of it. one from my own.. the best things in life are those that you cant have.. and you know why, because once you have it, it loses all that mystery that captivated you. then disappointment settles in because its not what you thought it would be. unless someone would like to prove me wrong?

oh well. missed the meteor shower tonight because i watched phone booth and forgot all about it. that movie was so lousy and the only reason i watched it was to see if he got shot at the end. actually i was just hoping he would and it would just end. but whatever.

later taters.

"event","havent written in a while.. weird for me but oh well im sure you survived.

hmm well ive basically been working or sleeping or dance. work sucks the big one like usual. this whole bi weekly sucks.

last weeks concert.. head automatica.. was fricken sweet. im in love.. and still have this desire to dance. haha. it was great. im so glad jenn knew id be in love with them. although that crazy drunk girl was making me nervous that was next to me.. i kept expecting to get hit in the head by her dance moves. hehe. it was funny. and towards the end of the night, next thing i knew.. i got my boob grabbed. haha it was like slow mo.. i saw it happen to jenn, then beth.. and i looked over to some kid walking in cause it looked like someone i knew and then it happened. ahahahahahaha. good times. and scary sandwiches at 7/11.

not last night but the night before erin and erinn came over and we hung out while watching nip/tuck. god i miss that show, its been a while since ive seen it. and we all decided to have nip/tuck parties.. basically get together every tuesday.. eat, gossip, and eat some more junk food.

went to the beach yesterday with erin.. it was cloudy and windy yet i still managed to get burned. but today hooray its a tan. im really thinking on keeping it up.. maybe i will go tanning like once a week if i can scrounge up six bucks.. figure thats like three or four medium ice coffees. i think i can do it.
i really had a good time.. plus she told me about one of the beaches being for free.. so you know me, if its free its for me. so we went.. and i must say its been a while since ive laughed that hard. one realization.. guys boobs are funny.. end of story.

yea i made a friend yesterday.. ive come to realize that i need to be more social and meet more people. but at the gas station.. i think not. no but it was cool.. he asked me if i got good gas mileage on the volvo.. i was like uhh.. i dont know. he just laughed and asked me if it was my moms.. so i told him no its mine.. and im just oblivious to cars so he told me he was thinking on getting a s70.. which is a pretty sweet make or model i forget which word to use. so we got to talking about music n' stuff. he told me he just moved from narragansette to e.p. ghetto ville. so he was looking to meet some nice people. mental note.. joes the name. im so bad with them. so maybe i'll see him at the summer concert series. oh and to top it off.. he drove away with out his gas cap on.. so i hurried up and beeped the horn.. haha he looked so embarrassed. haha. then he told me to tune the radio to bru.. it was old school korn. im guessing hes alright. that and he wore the old old incubus shirt. so okay first impression.. and he liked my camouflage skirt n' lace camisole.. thats right ladies and gentle man.. he said camisole.. not tank top. and he mouth kinda dropped when i said i worked at v.s. hehe. i like this new weapon. so he said i sported the outfit well. one point for him. so we'll see.

alrighty i think thats about it.. gonna hit up thayer tomorrow with shan so that will give me something to look forward to seeing how im closing tonight. ugh.

later taters.

p.s.

*to jenn..

the twitchy kid from sleepover is now on a new show called 'the days'.. and oh yes, hes still wicked hot in a pedophile way too. its on sunday i think it was? unsure though.. but i totally was flipping through the channels and saw him.. and then cracked up cause i thought of you agreeing with me that he was cute in the movie even though he was tweaking out and gettin made fun of by justin. its okay though, hes normal on the show. ;)

oh and the other ""hot"" kid that was popular has his own show too on the same network.. weird."

"event","its been an interesting week i must admit.

worked non-stop and got screwed over, and over and over. i love it when im taken advantage of. but i got a paycheck so its not so bad. this whole two weeks thing sucks.. i want it back to money every week. not to mention, every other week i get 1 day of work. what the fuck is up with that?!? and its the minimum, sat. 12-4. its such shit working there. i need a new job.. i need to get back into babysitting.. no taxes. thats what im talking about and i could get paid for watching movies. that was the life.

so i took my revenge, and made up some lame ass story to get my hours changed for yesterday just to go to a concert. (stretches, yea it felt good to lie just to have some fun) so i got out of work at 4 and jenn picked me up at 4:30 and we headed down to norton to meet up with mike and his friends. then from there we went to a wicked concert. kinda kicking myself for not getting the slow coming day cd, but oh well. there was also a star siting.. ashton was there selling merch.. hehe, watch him he plays with his hair, left to right.. that and he was so pretty it hurt. and the girls hair was funny cause it looked like it got electrocuted. hehe. 

dont worry, it was only 4 and a half hours of keys in the ignition. classic. and who would of thought, 7/11's do exist in mass?!? i know i didnt.

vive la ska.
'nough said.

in other news, my computer lives! it just needs a new fan or something. so thats do-able.

getting nervous cause ric still doesnt have any good news for me. and totally weirded out, i got a brochure from risd on classes n' stuff cause i took a couple fashion classes there during high school, and my mom asked me if she could throw it out, then said something that i should get my transcripts together so i could go there next year and blah blah blah. granted i still dont know what i want, but last i knew everyone wanted me to be a history professor.. everyone  told me what a waste becoming a fashion designer including my mom and all of a sudden shes encouraging it. i dont know what to make of this. 

sigh. i hate the unpredictable.. 
sometimes.

im spent.. gonna finish watching the good girl.. again.

later taters.

p.s.

jake gyllenhaal broke up with kirsten dunst. allll right.

"event","end quote.. thanks to matt and his wonderful quote of the night.

well it feels like forever since ive last updated.. reason being, my laptop shit the bed still ever after the dell technician ""fixed it"" cough cough my ass. so i reinstalled windows and blah blah blah well knowing it wasnt going to fix the problem as well but i had to to prove to my parents so ive got to find someone to crack it open and remove all my computers std's. fucking great. and to top it off ive got random strangers IM'ing me saying you sent me an email and now theres something wrong.. well you people are dumbasses. dont ask me how i got your screen name if you dont know who i am. obviously its either a scam, virus or bullshit marketing. honestly people are dumb.

well not a whole lot has been going on.. working, hanging out and concerts.. not that im complaining. 

weird stuffs been going on.. i mean like thurs and friday ive had wicked eagle eyes going on.. like me and shan went to the used book store and the first books i see are anne rice.. weird. ive never really been in that store before too and i just picked a random isle to walk down and boom i look to my right and i see vampire lestat.. my favorite book. coincidense.. i think not. then as a joke i was looking at astronomy books, and i went to reach for one and i knocked a couple of them down and the book still standing was one of the books from donnie darko. how bizarre is that? 
then before that, we went to best buy, and we're looking at movies cause shan wanted girl, interrupted.. and we're walking into a isle, and the first movie i see and strictly pick up was the graduate.. and to top it off, i picked up the only one marked 9.99, how weird is that?!?!?!?! totally fucking awesome. so it was a sign that i was meant to have it. so i bought it. god i love it. mrs. robinson is my hero.
then on friday me and shan went to self checkout at stop n' shop and i totally saw money in the change part.. thirty smackers. so we got chinese food fo free. thanks to that poor sucker short thirty bucks. and all i wanted the night before was chinese and no one wanted any so it was a sign. :) but really my luck has been weird. now if only it could be applied to the non existing love life then i'd be in business. hehe.

the last concert on wed. was wicked good, at the call.. which by the way, jenn you popped my call cherry. good to know shes gentle. hehe. i loved the one and only band we saw that night.. it was ska. i dont care, ska isnt dead. 

then there was tonight over at the living room where i dragged erin well knowing she isnt into the music at all, but she was a trooper for me. met up with jenn n' justin and the crew. i had a good time.. interesting. got whipped by matt just because a ""hello"" would be too easy. :) thanks justin for another cool ass compliment for smelling too good for him.. kick ass cool.

god i can be such a chicken shit when i want to be. honestly i have to stop being so shy and being my own worst enemy by over thinking and worrying what other people are going to think of me. oh well.

then split there and drove around town with erin and had girl talk then went back to her house and hung out with her and matt while he shared his stories on fishing and good food. then we totally got nostaglic and talked about the best bands. good times good times.
hoping i can go with him to see my chemical romance and senses fail. that would be sweet.. if not with him then maybe i could find someone to drag. :)

gonna finish 24 hour people.. 

tomorrow.. day off one: shopping extravaganza with erin and shan.. woot woot.

hoping to hit the beach sometime this week. hmm. maybe tuesday. or go by myself on friday.. my other day off seeing how no one else has that day off. we'll see. 

g'night fuckos.

ah-hahahahahaha. so yea, my weekend ended on a really great note by hanging out with the lovely jenn and comical justin. jenn picked me up and we headed over to his house without getting lost. woot woot for his good directions. 
it was good to catch up with her on the drive there.. instead of l.j. hehe. girl talk rules.
anyways..
so anchorman was sold out :( but instead we saw sleepover. my life has completely changed because of that movie. (rolls eyes and snickers) okay now thats a lie if i ever did say so. all in all though it was a lot better with justin and jenns commentary.. i do have one confession.. i like brownies over celery.. i guess that doesnt say much for me according to the movie. 

then afterwards we watched 'joey' pilot. it seems like its going to be a fairly good show. pretty funny.. weird how they chose the music they did. oh well.

i learned one thing.. chinchillas are a lot cuter alive.. and they smell really clean amazingly. haha.

yea, my cheeks still hurt from last night. you two are too too much for me and i heart you for that. i was in need of some comical relief. time for serious face.. (laughs) ouch. 

so last nights greatness extended into today.. woke up, watched both indiana jones raider of the lost arch and temple of doom. fan-fuckin-tastic. god i love those movies. then cleaned the house a bit, made dinner n' stuff. went to dance.. usual. except class went amazingly well considering my shoes are complete mush. yay me for double turns repeatedly on both sides.

came back here and watched the new episode of american chopper.. the bike so far looks incredible.. its for the premiere of 'i, robot.' seriously ive never seen a bike look so cool before and its practical.

now im probably fall asleep watching 'edward scissorhands'..

then tomorrow consists of the dell technician comming over to fix my lap top.. then possibly slik willy concert with the lovely jenn. we'll see.

oh the other day.. at work i totally met one of the producers from 'napoleon dynamite' she was wicked funny. she gave me like her whole life story while i was looking up her credit and account n' stuff. shes pretty interesting. i wicked want to see that movie.. i cant wait.

alright i know i had more to say but im sure you'll live without it.

g'night fuckers.

whatever.



work sucked.. had to be there at 8 and the shippment didnt come in until 9.. so we ended up doing busy work to keep us awake. made some big bucks for overtime past two sundays. so thats good i guess.


why is it everything seems to be okay, until someone else puts their prospective into things, then it just turns out to be complete and utter shit afterwards.


going to dance tonight cause its the free summer sessions. so it should be interesting.. i havent had this woman for a teacher since my beginner days.. like when i was six. so hopefully i get something out of it.


i need to get out of here. not to sound all mellow dramatic, but i need to clear my head.

later fuckos.

"event","so how about today..

so much for being good.

hmm.

yea.

(smiles)

so, came home around 4ish, made dinner, then i was stuck on the phone with 3 dell representatives.. 
finally after being disconnected the second time.. 
ugh, i resorted to flirting with the third guy just to keep him on the phone. it was weird.. i had him laughing his ass off. yea, im slick like that.. and not to mention i got a free modem plus a technician to come to my house and fix my computer. (yea i fucked it up.. apparently im supposed to unplug the phone jack during a thunder storm.. but shhh, they dont have to know about that). i told him i didnt need the technician and that im computer savvy enough but its procedure. whatever.

then went for a ride with shan.. 
then watched 'secretary'

hehe. god i love that movie.

so umm. where in the world can i find a boss like that?!? fucking incredibly hot. so umm, anyone want me to type anything.. im a great typist.. (wink)

(bites lip) mmyea.  im gonna stop.

yea. i need to re-arrange things that are going on with my life. theres some dead weight that needs to be dropped simply because i know by only giving him more chances, its only going to make matters worse. i know what he can and cant give me and that should be unacceptable. so i think this is the last time im going to say this. no more shithead. im done. no more mental bullshit. 
no more guys with girlfriends, i mean i know we're friends and thats cool, but dont act like youre single when youre around me. 
no more misleading guys on.. even if its subconscious. hmm. i going to try to be normal and have normal friendships. not to sound like a skank, because im far from it.. i just ended up with more guys for friends than girls simply because between every friendship there was some sort of sexual tension.. like something unresolved so the only reason to which why we still hang out is just to see how far we can push each other. it ends up going no where, but its weird.

so im gonna try and not give them so many chances. i mean its not like they're given back.

oh well. enough deep thinking. its making my head hurt.

oh i heard the funniest thing on the radio today as i was stuck in traffic.. some guy called up thinking john edwards thats with kerry now was the psychic. ah-hahaha.. he was disappointed after seeing the pictures in the paper. he was like, well we could of just send him over to all the places we want to fix and find out all their secrets.

that and americans spent an estimate of 3 billion dollars last year on ring tones alone. sometimes i am not proud to be an american. are we that fucked up? i mean there is plenty we could of done with that money other than to buy ring tones so that we look cooler in front of other people.. and most times they're lame ass tunes which only make you look more like a fool anyways. stupid fucks.

night.

"event","so anyone down for some drunken sex?


eh it was worth a shot.


so anyways, today sucked. i literally rolled out of bed and went to work.. 2-6. its such a waste of a day. got a few shirts at express for work and i definitely got the two tanks from vic's for 4.99 each. it feels so good. but yea works been going okay i guess.. still got the new girl stigma but everyones really nice at being nice to me. i mean theyre good at covering up that they hate fixing my mistakes and stuff. :)

so my backs been hurtin more so than usual, and come to find out my boss was a massage therapist before working here so she gave me a quick rub and said that i have a very strong and muscular back (which is a good thing.. also from dancing for so long) and that im also the first person shes met with the amount of tension as well. apparently i have more tension then most people and its not good. i wasnt lieing when i said it hurts. oh it felt so good.. i cant remember the last time i ever got one.. and not 5-10 mins later i could feel my muscles tightening up again and then they started spazing. now im worse than i started off. :) so much for that.

so anyone want to give me a back rub? i promise i'll give a mean one right back.. i am known for them, not to brag or nothing. :)


-sigh- it seems like im never going to get to hang out with him again. what the fuck. sometimes i think its just going to be all talk between me and any other guy. figures. well at least he doesnt have a girlfriend.. that i know of.. well at least im moving up in the world.

go me for being a scum bag. god i love having class.

alright im spent and im going to go bask in my new AIR CONDITIONED room. thats right mother fuckers ive got a.c.. if you thought i never got out of bed before.. oh man just you wait. not only do i have the best bed, but ive got the comforters and a.c. to prove it. 

so um.. wanna test it out? wink wink. (thats only to guys.. and i know shans already in love with my bed.. but dude, no.)

alright later muther fuckers.

"event","well happy fucking fourth of july..

honest i would like to thank each and everyone one of you for making this day so fucking special so far as treating me like shit. you know who you are and if you dont, then im sure youll get the hint when youre sober.

in all truth, let me introduce to you the phrase ""kicking the dog"".. if you dont understand or just dont give a shit to what im trying to get across, let me spell it out for you.. it means dont take your bad night out on someone innocent who wasnt there and didnt do anything wrong to you to deserve the shit treatment.

thanks for reminding me why i dont need a boyfriend.

run with that.


in other news, i'd like to thank the communist state of china's sweatshops for allowing us to view such beautiful fireworks.. truly you are masters of pyrotechnics. 

good night mo'fo's.

""silently screaming..""

p.s. just so you know.. it physically hurt me to say that was the song for my mood, but i gotta hand it to him for that one song.. who knew the words ""fuck that"" could be used so wisely by kid rock.. yea i'll leave it at that, and kick my own ass later."

"event","no really, they fucking rocked tonight.

it was definitely a better show than expected. 
almost cried during ""wish you were here"".. dont know what that was all about besides being all nostaglic. okay i do, but whatever moving on. kinda wished i had someones hand to hold during that song.. it was cute to see shan and ben.. and then there was me, myself and i. yeah im good company.. getting over it. 
i was so happy they played my favorite songs off of make yourself.. ""make yourself"" and ""the warmth"".. you bet your ass i belted out the lyrics. god, brandon boyd = fucking god.. so far as vocals live. he sounded great. 
and the drummer.. (wipes the drool) he had to of played a 3 minute drum solo easy, if not longer.. it was fucking amazing.. if thats how he is on drums.. id like to test his other forms of stamina. but it was really cool, the guitarist (forgot his name), brandon and the drummer ended up jamming out.. the guitarist had his own miniature set of drums and brandon played on a tonga drum (something like that) .. in short it was so fucking cool to watch and hear them have a face off-jam out. 
shan - ""jamaican-mon"" 
me - ""yea..he's ja'makin me horny""

i heart bassists.. and who can forget the drummers. thank god for them.

and to top off the night, they covered sound garden ""black hole sun"".. he was like 'i know youre not supposed to cover the bands you grew up with and liked, but fuck it..' they sounded so great covering that song. i was so excited cause it was one of my favorite songs when i was younger. yum.

i was surprised how short spartas set was.. four songs. four fucking songs.. they were wicked good and thats all they got. kinda mad.

all in all i had a very good night.


watching 'red shoes'.. soon gonna put donnie darko on.. again. i cant help it.. im in love with the movie.

g'night girls and toys.

""i wish you where (t)here.."""

i heart donnie darko.

i dont know what it is.. i mean besides the obvious of jake gyllenhall. mmm. my favorite scene of him was definitely him with walking with the axe. hehe. yea that was incredibly hot.. that and when he got all nerdy with the sanitation shpeal. who knew an ax would turn me on.

yea this was one of the best movies ive seen in a while. right up there with virgin suicides, and crimes and punishments in suburbia. but then again i like the ""unhappy movies."" 

..cant wait till tomorrow night. incubus and sparta. woot woot for that. i heart brandon boyd.

so work was rough. speaking of rough.. guys with girlfriends need to stop talking to me.. its gettin annoying. im starting to think there isnt a decent guy out there.

mmm new episodes of nip/tuck. its the best show on earth.. well almost as good as family guy.

gettin sleepy..

no one cool to talk to now. boo.

g'night.

""theres gonna be some changes around here.. starting with your underware.""


bored.

"event","well its been a shitty two days so far.

i found out my friends mom died. so i will be attending the wake tonight and maybe the funeral tomorrow.. i dont know though. i cant handle funerals too well. then there was some more bad news so far as my other friend and his mom with the brain tumor thats back. i just dont understand it. these two moms are the most beautiful and caring people that i know and they had and have to suffer for it. and go figure theyre very religious with strong faith. what fucking good is it in believing in something that doesnt help save those that are strong followers that are in dire need? no one can replace someone that easily.. and not to mention she'll never get to see her kids grow up and accomplish wonderful things. what kind of just god is that.

fucked shit thats all i have to say.


i tried to find something i could wear for pants or a skirt today but failed so im borrowing shans skirt.

jenn couldnt make it today.. boo. so me and shan ended up taking a trip to 
mattiapoisett (something like that spelling). the salvation army there is incredible. got two pocket books, a shirt and skirt for 4 smackers. booya!

now im just veggin out dreading tonight.

im gonna need a hug after this i know it.

times like this i kinda wish i had someone, well a boyfriend that i could just go to and be comforted.. like a safe haven. i miss that the most i must say.

oh well. someday maybe someone will want me and put up with me.


sigh. gonna go watch donnie darko by myself. :) i love me.


sincerely 
""the vampire herself.."" (thanks a lot dave)

""dont say youre happy out there without me, i know you cant be.. because its no good."""

"event","i havent felt this good in a while thanks to the people that kept me company last night. :) my parents have got to go away more often.. next time i say do it up right and have a bounce house. 

but really though, its weird to think that you dont miss people until you meet up with them again and realize why you used to hang out with them in the first place. it makes me feel all warm and tingly inside.. either that or its my love button on highly aroused. (aaaaahhaha.) sorry that was inappropriate.

but again i have learned a couple lessons last night.

1 - dont drink before making anything edible. honestly i was cracking up with myself for drinking while making breakfast foods for the morning. i kept making stupid mistakes but it tasted good so no one will ever have to know.

2 - no more packs of ciggs around while drinking. i dont know how i managed to smoke that much in one night and not make myself sick. the sad part is i dont even know i did it until sean said woah chain smoker. eh its only when im roasty toasty.

3 - the toilet can be your enemy.. something happend and now it just runs.. dave tried to fix it cause its all we heard but it was no use.

4 - ive come to realize my true feelings towards coheed. yea.. the lyrics are phenomenal but when it comes to the vocals not so much.. at least ive got shan and mike to back me up on that. but then again i dont know shit about music so whateve.

5 - after brainstorming with erin and matt i think i have the best way to shock the family at the next ""get to gether"" im going to stroll in with my ghetto boy kenny doin the cript walk and have a wife beater sayin white trash princess and name plated gold hoops that say margaret. but i think matt might just tie with me if he gets anything pierced. but its a challenge im willing to take.

6 - ive come to terms that i cant give directions.. hehe i had to meet jenn up and have her follow me from a midway point. im so pround of myself. but i think i might of jinxed myself trying to give her directions back to the highway. oops. hopefully she made it okay.. which im assuming so seeing how i didnt get any emergency phone calls. :)

the ultimate..

7 - i can cook and have it be edible while fucked up. thats a task all in its self when im straight but apparently i can make good french toast and homefries. that made my morning watching the guys eat.


went to work which sucked because it was immigrant day. i ""helped"" 4 people that didnt speak a word of english.. try and explain to people that we dont carry a bra with padding in the size 38 and up. its useless.. and of course im trying to use my hands and stuff but i just got blank looks back. i seriously wanted to shove bras down anyones throat today that gave me a hard time. not to sound like a complete shithead, but get a english/whatever language you speak to help the language boundary next time. seriously its not my fault we dont speak the same language so dont take it out on me.

then came here cooked again.. well dinner for aaron. and once again ive out done myself. he ate like a pig and said it was wicked good and that hes never seen so much food/ he couldnt remember the last sitdown home cooked meal.

ive found my new way to get momentary happiness.. make their tummies full and content.


going to the beach tomorrow.. yahoo. although it sucks cause im only working like two days this week and no babysitting. oh well.

then hittin up savers with jenn and shan on tuesday! woot woot. we're going to go about our ""evil ways"" and be savers sluts. i still say donation-shmonation. booya.

going to bed due to lack of sleep.

that is all.

""wait that wasnt the wall.. (slam) there we go. hehe, so you really enjoyed that huh? now where is my.."""

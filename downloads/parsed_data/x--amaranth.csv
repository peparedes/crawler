<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> Your power is that you can<br>look into the future and see what is coming.<br>How far and long you can look is all depending<br>on your skill level. This can, as all powers,<br>be used in both evil and good. Even if it may<br>seem like a boring ability it is a huge<br>responsibility for the carrier, becase they are<br>constantly tempted with doing the wrongs deeds<br>(e.g. cheat on a test). It takes high morals to<br>not be brought down with it.
<br>Therefor you fit with this power quite well.<br>You take responsibility and do what is the<br>right thing to do. This does not make you a<br>saint, since you're only human after all. But<br>it makes a trustworthy person and you are loyal<br>to camrades and/or team mates. In school you<br>were probably a good student. If you were<br>social varies from person to person, but most<br>clairvoyant people tend to prefer their own<br>company or that of close friends and family.<br>That is because you are wise and knows how to<br>treasure the reliable in your life, since you<br>know popularity can be a false element. You are<br>also not that big on taking risks and prefer<br>what is already explored. That is because you<br>don't like suprises, they can turn out bad and<br>then you won't be in control.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> Since you're always<br>doing the right thing and being trustworthy all<br>the time you can become frustrated. Also, all<br>that you carry on your shoulders may stress you<br>out. You need to relax to be in good mental<br>shape. </p>

"event","There. Now hopefully, I'll be able to keep up with people a little better. Yumerou said he's met a lot of interesting people around here, too. I don't know why everyone decided to come here, but I guess I'll find out, won't I?

"event","After an amazing vacation in Germany with my BF it's soon back to reality and the fact that I still hate my job!
How can I stay there, when with all my heart I loath that place more than anything? Or not the place as such, just the people and especially the boss. who has no leadership skills what so ever!!! (How did she even get that job????? It's beyond me to figure it out...)
I wish I were better at writing job applications and that I dealt better with rejection, coz really that is what applying for jobs is for me - rejection upon rejection, upon rejection! I feel so crushed every time I get turned down and I have the hardest time pulling myself up from the hole I fall into when it happens. Usually whenever I would feel really bad about something I'd go buy myself something pretty (more often than not it would be shoes;-) ) But now with only a part time job and my economy suffering for it, I can't even do that! I always feel super bad and ashamed when I spend money!
So what do I do? How do you write a great and brilliant, self-promoting and glorifying job application, when all you feel is worthless and completely without talent?
God, I wish I knew - if I did, I might have a full time job by now!

But on the upside I found a place on-line where I can watch TV-shows not airing where I live and best of all - I get to sing along and show that I can do it ""Once More, With Feeling!""

Will be back with more and I'm still thinking about the props, y'know:-)"

Talk back: What are the most awesome movie props?

Pop reader Scott, aka sfconcierge, came up with a good discussion topic the other night during a baseball game: What's your personal ""Holy Grail of movie props""?

""For me, I said the original Yoda puppet from Empire Strikes Back,"" Scott writes. ""(My friend) said the captain's chair from Wrath of Khan, because, apparently, they used the same set for both Kirk and Khan, so that chair was sat in by both Shatner and Ricardo Montalban.""

"event","So - there I went and did it! I FINALLY did it... After not one, not two but THREE failed attempts at installing Mozilla Foxfire onto my PC! (I know - you're wondering HOW I failed at that THREE times!!!) But I have done it now - I have successfully installed it and I love all it's features:-) Not that I didn't get explore to do most of the same things but still - the important thing is - I DID it!!! And I did it all by myself;-D
So super was it that I decided to celebrate this feat by watching my favorite BtVS episode (or at least one of the top ten episodes) ""Once More With Feeling"" on JooX! And then - as almost always, when I install new shit - My computer got sick and DIED! It contracted a Trojan virus as well as a Bloodhound virus... Thank god for Norton AV or it would have died and never come back. This time, as opposed to last time this happened when the computer did NOT come back to life and had to be resurrected with all the loss to follow, the computer only crashed for a short while and self-healed!!! 
Non-the-less - it is fucking annoying that every time I install something new on my computer it has to freak out and semi-die/freeze and be non-functional for so very very long! Fucking shitty piece of crap - and if I had the money and the air in my budget I'd SOOOOOOO buy a new one! But there are so many other things to spend money on that a computer doesn't seem to be anywhere near my immediate future. In fact it's so far from my future that it might as well be wishful thinking - so let's make it just that.

I'll make myself a list of items entitled ""wishful thinking!""

1. A new computer/laptop

2. A home that I own

3. TBA

...etc..."

"event","If you could travel back in time to spend a day with someone, who would it be and why?

I think I'd travel back in time and spend time with - wauw this is hard - Michael Kamen, if it can be an impulse choice?

I like his works and I'd like to spend the time with him during the making of the Metallica S/M album and concert. Just to follow the creative process experience such a great composer and conductor at work...

On a bigger scale, I think it would be men like Lennon, MLK, JFK and Jesus. Nietzsche or Freud just to feed a perverse interest or Orson Wells and Hitchcock. Hitchcock mainly to find out if he really was as horrid as all that? 
I think - to be honest Lennon! Lennon because he was a man on the right track, trying to do something which, as JFK and MLK also did, would benefit the world and the future on a much larger scale, than just something which would benefit himself and his celebrity.

Or if I have to super shallow - Marilyn Monroe - because she needed help! I'm good with the helping...."

As black as this is - is my disbelief at how ridiculously expensive concert tickets are allowed to be!!!

I'm dying to go to one of the George Michael ""25 Live"" concerts taking place in Aarhus, two months from now - and for once I made a valid attempt at getting hold of tickets (I just couldn't be bothered when Madonna came to DK. - I mean, I dislike people as it is - and having to share a (to a degree) confined space with no less that approx. 80,000 of them for over three hours was just not that appealing to me, no matter the size of the Queen of Pop!) But George I'd like to go see and (probably mostly) hear! But (there's always a butt!!!) ticket prices are insane! The cheapest (and this I'd actually pay) start at a whopping 675,- dkkr. With the most expensive (music only) tickets clock in at a staggering 1495,- dkkr.!!! What is that????

That's crazy is what that is - and to be honest with you - I'm not that big a George M. fan!

So tough luck Mr. GM but my money you'll have to do without!!!

So, just caught two episodes of Jackass - love that lame-ass show! One episode had my all time favourite skit - Night Monkeys - Silly and horrible Gorilla suits and out and about Jackassin' it up! with Brad Pitt in toe (Episode #3.8) The other was the next episode - episode #3.9 - and it is now my fave episode ever! It was hilarious! Brad Pitt again is center-attention man! Brad walking down the street, people see him. Brad Pitt gets in line for...something... and then - a van drives up! Guy ridin' shot-gun leans out the window, shouts: Hey Brad Pitt - can I have your autograph? Brad and others go - ""oh leave me/him alone"" plaguing Brad Pitt for his autograph ensues! Then Five guys jump out of the van - Grab Brad Pitt and pull him (Brad Pitt struggling the best of his acting abilities allow him) Brad Pitt screams frantically for help! NO ONE helps! Brad Pitt is loaded into the back of the van and it speeds of! Everyone in line is baffled at what they've just witnessed - Brad Pitt getting kidnapped! One guy hurriedly call the police - and tells the police: Brad Pitt's just been kidnapped! He was just standing in line and a van pulled up and kidnapped him... No, I'm not kidding - this call is for real - Brad Pitt's just been kidnapped!

It was hillarious - I couldn't breath and I almost had a Pirates from Penzance moment (see:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100405/)

That's right I start school - not in two months but in two weeks! It's scary I think! I'm looking so forward to it but what if I'm either too good or worse yet, not good enough?

I'm undecided as of right now. I've made up my mind to give it the chances it deserves but most importantly I'll stick it through and get all the things I need done and taken care of, done and taken care of, ie. finding out which is the easiest way to get to school and what it costs and how I deduct the expenses from my taxes?

My computer works again!!! yeai!

It grabbed hold of no less than three nasty vira last Sunday and it's taken me the better part of a week to get up the nerve to turn it on again.
I haven't a clue how to work with computers and I've always hated this one (Acer Aspire 1350) I has brought me nothing but worry and triff, so I've decided to save up some money and by me a new lab-top as soon as I can and this time - it wont be this pc crap! No, I'll invest in a macBook next! Both my parents and my sister have iMacs so why not me? It takes about 48 hours to learn how to operate a mac if you've never had one but seeing as I do all the teching in my family I'm guessing it'll only take me about 4,8 hours to feel comfortable.

Also, we are coming up on October 1st which is the day that marks the start of my apartment hunt! I cannot live with my sister any longer! I think we've both known that since the beginning but now - now it's serious and October 1st means that I most likely wont be moving till after new years. Last year we moved in during November and December and that was just beyond chaos so I wont be doing that again any time soon!

Oh well, the bitch-sister-from-hell wants me to clean so I should better elsewhy there'll be no living with her!!!

The hoot-e-nany! was thrown by my great friend M. T'does at her place always end up in one of two ways, someone passes out and the rest party on till dawn or everybody clampers into bed and just have a gay ol' time of cozying it up! (M probably has the softest skin in the world, so cuddling up with her is just lovely:-)) 

The t'do last night/this morning ended on the bed!

So today is only and completely for me and for relaxing!

Sidetrack: HOW is it that pro-ana bulimic look fashionable? Nicole Richie, Hilary Duff, Lindsey Lohan, that Olsen twin! What the fuck is up with that? When did healthy become outdated? Bony bulimic sucks - sex with that has got to feel like fucking a bike! All hail Kate Winslet, Liv Taylor and every other full-figured girl out there!


But today I enjoy just being relaxed, make-up free and wild-haired (Sunday = troll hair!)

Sunday for me must contain as little brain activity as possible, which is why when drama occures I always try to stear clear of it. Have had too much of it so far...
Sis and her boyfriend started the day by having a row, thankfully she'd now left to talk to him in person, letting me be very by my lonesome - and I love being by my lonesome. In fact I adore weekends spent with no people other than me!

"event","How come the things you least want to have happen always happen when you aren't expecting them to happen at all! It's sorta like turning you back just as that really horrible/amazing thing takes place!
In my case it's that horrible ting!

It's that horrible _guy_ thing! 

There's always _that_ guy! Isn't there always that guy! The one who still is under your skin. The one who's still pulling on your heartstrings even though you tried to cut every last one with every means of shearers you could possibly dream up?!?

I seriously thought I was 99.8% over this guy! I knew it wasn't finalized but I just really really thought I knew myself better! He got so far under my skin and he's the only guy to ever really get behind the inner wall! Man!

I knew it was gonna be difficult seeing him but for fuck sake - it's been what two-and-a-half years - and I truly believed that once I saw him again I'd be able to deal with it. Not deal well but at least not have the surge of racing adrenalin and horrid nerves standing on end! 

I really thought it wouldn't happen! I really really believed it...

But it did!!!

Adrenalin, nerves, the awful feeling of having to straighten my back, suck in my stomach and worst of all look like I didn't see him or even give a fuck!
I mean it's been so long - I shouldn't give a fuck! We didn't even have a relationship - we were ""friends with benefits!"" There were not supposed to be feelings involved! It was just lust!

I thought I'd prepared myself for seeing him in the street (or perhaps thinking you see him (knowing you didn't) isn't preparing?) mentally prepared myself to not give a damn! 
Today I saw him - or more correctly I saw the back of him and I tensed up, all the things I didn't wanna feel, all the responses I so direly wished to not have happen - well they happened! I'm still shaken and it's been 4 hours! 
My shoulders tense up - they physically tighten - and I can't relax! 

I wanna get over this guy SO bad yet somehow I CANNOT let him go! I'm desperate and will try anything! I don't know what to do anymore!

And still I can't help but wonder - are the things I'm feeling in actuality anguish and hurt and anger towards the fact that it ended the way it did?
Because it ended rather awkwardly! It just sorta abruptly stopped! No new relationships, no ""I don't feel like doing this anymore!"" no ""this is getting too intense/going in a different direction than I'd like it to!"" conversations. I did confess to thinking our ""liaisons"" would be less complicated if we made it a relationship but I never said it was definitively what I wanted!
I'm pretty sure that's what made him freak and run for cover. That and the fact that he was very good friends with my ex, who also found out about our little ""tryst!"" 
It was just so ""blah!"" No ending, no final - it just... stopped! And I think that's what has me not capable of letting it go! I don't think it's the feelings anymore, my feelings for him that is, I think it's that feeling of lack of closure that has me still not able to let it go completely! This, me not getting an explanation, not being Told WHY! I'd rather hear that I'm too intense or that we wanted different things or that he really really really thought I was ugly! Just something - something to explain to me why it had to stop!? Is that too much to ask - something that would award me a feeling to return to - a feeling, an explanation, a reason for me to finally be able to work towards closure! Is it?

Still, at least I didn't look awful!!"

Well, I had a nice day. Not having to got to work before 11:45 a.m. is really nice. Makes you able to sleep longer!

Nothing interesting happened really - just the same ol' humdrum, did a bunch of face charts, sold some stuff and had a great time with my co-workers.

I love my job and I love my co-workers, sans one. She is a right disgrace. She's a trainee - we'll call her T! She has less than a year left of her training-period before she'll be a sales assistant. However she managed to hold on to this position or even make it through is beyond me! But I'm getting ahead of myself.
T is the kind of person who initially, upon meeting her, you think - Nice girl! And at first you have fun with her and you find her mode of work nice, as it fits the ""I don't wanna be here really feeling."" But then slowly you realise that the things she tells you and the things which have happened to her are too extraordinary and even more shockingly too similar to the things which have happened to other people. And that's when you start losing your patience! You start testing her to catch her in a lie, and at first you just laugh when you do but slowly you just wanna confront her and tell her to shut the fuck up! Also you realise that her ""chilled out"" work-ethics is her lack of work ethics! Breaks that run three times the set break-time, disappearing acts, dating/sleeping with the in-house staff though not allowed and outright lying to bosses! She slowly begins to piss you off! The mere sound of her voice and the sight of her just makes you wanna commit violent crimes, all directed at her! And it begins eating away at your oven joy of your job! You start pondering if you should tell someone! You start seriously thinking about changing your job. And finally you crack - you start complaining to your closest colleagues only to discover that they fell EXACTLY the same as you! But still... Nothing happens! Bosses are contacted, complaints are directed at the right responsible people and still - nothing!

You want to have something happen and that's when you realise - actions have been taken - and she's been reprimanded but still she ignores the word of the bosses! Disregards the laws of the store and generally doesn't seem to realise that no one likes her anymore!

She's right awful! But in spite of her I still love my job and best of all my colleagues!

Right now am wondering though: Whence done with school - should I stay with Smashbox or should I move back to MAC or try something completely different? Like introduce Kevyn Aucoin Cosmetics to danes? I wonder..."

"event","I don't even remember the last time I was _invited_ to go anywhere on a Saturday night! Except on New Years Eve which doesn't really count coz - guess what - I helped plan that event (and then sadly ended up feeling excluded from said event and left very early!)

No, I mean invited to a real party! Where people come to have fun and be silly and get drunk and make out or have wicked weird conversations about why Jack Black, Kevin Smith and The Red Hot Chili Peppers are positively the most brilliant people ever fostered on this God's Green Earth! The kind of parties I USED to go to but now so long for to be held!

I don't believe that we are all so old and mature and BORING that we can no longer muster the strength or indeed the people! to throw such parties! I mean - I'm only 23! I'm in my partying prime and so are the people I supposedly so call my friends. Are we so set in our ways that we consider parties of this nature adolescent and stupid - dare I even suggest unnecessary?!?

I refuse to accept it so - I hereby call out to all people of all faces and ages to join me in refusal of boredom and the set ways of twenty-somethings! The time is now! We shall get our groove on and our drink on - and we shall be silly and young and we shall do things adults and the people so set in their ways will consider stupid - but which we will find absolutely necessary and ever so delightful!

What I want to do is dance! I want to get down and funky and drink drinks and sip cocktails... 

... but alas I'm home alone on a Saturday night..."

"event","My first ever post and it only took a mere three and a half hours to get my computer to do it. 
All I had to do was by-pass and trick my web-browser into not believing I was here! But I am - and I intend to stay for a very long time (even if this will have to be something I need to do every time I need access!)

I should better introduce myself - I consider myself an enigma most likely just as you all consider yourselves enigmas. I'm a person of many facets and as life would have it many and complicated problems.

But then aren't we all?

I have an idea about what I'm doing here or even why I'm here but all shall be revealed in time - right now I really just want to acquaint myself with it all.

Yet - just to get you started - and properly introduced - which do you think would be less painful? 

Drowning or hanging?"

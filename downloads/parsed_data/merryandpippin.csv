the triumphant return of season 2! *buuurpboopdooo!* 

wow. that was unimpressive.
now well all of you hippies and treehuggers have been off smoking pipeweed and partying on tables, i've been... doing absolutely nothing. 


this new kid wade wants into our superhotandfoxyelectricbutnotreallycuzweliveinmiddleearth club. not so sure, he seems kinda shaddy and wants to play these minor characters. they dont even matter man. as a matter of fact, now that i think about it, why DID they even SHOOT movie scenes that didnt have me and pip in them? god, what a waste of film. 

i rocked it hard with samwise yesterday. but then this wench tried to step all up in our shit and we were like ""hells no you mordor whore"" . and then samwise did a break dance. it was phat.

why are we so badass? i dont know.

i've been missing the elegance that is pippin as of late. do return darling, for how shall i ever be complete with out you?

that's it. i need a pint. 

**merry***
no, no, NO. I DONT have a bloody garden!


but i could go for a carrot. a big one."

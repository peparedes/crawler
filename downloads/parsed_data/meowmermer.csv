"event","Anyone an expert at knitting with double sided needles? I've attempted it 2 times with minimal success. If you can help me out with any tips (i.e. correct way to hold the needles and keeping stitches between needles tight and without holes.) I can give you my simple crochet design for whipping out hats in under an hour. 


Projects in the making (using Stitch N Bitch Guide with my own ideas and a few others as well)
Rock Star wrist bands
   I've already made ones that say Rock * and Death Metal in camouflage, olive drab and blue.
   Got some in the making for ATP and Mastodon.
Some Hair rags made and in the makings.
Devil hats and kitty hats I'm stuck on (due double needle trouble)
Simple Crochet blanket of my own design almost complete plus a bear claw beauty in tha makes (I'll post pics when it's finished.)
And finally I plan to finish my well deserved ""I love Viking Metal"" Sweater design (modelled after the Peppermint twist sweater for the SNB book.)

Well post away if you want. I'd love to hear from anyone with great ideas or help anyone else who wants any help with their projects."

"event","Basically I like to knit and I like metal (among other music, but a lot of Viking metal). I play in B*tch Velour and i play back up 9with Hillary Deutsch) for Sarah Thomas (neither are metal but someday soon I'll have an all girl grind band :) ). I'll get back with more info on both bands and Argyle Records.  
On to knitting, love it, love it, love it!! Hillary and I both knit and Sara will soon so we'd like to get in touch with as many cool knitters as possible and help out the knitting community so do get in touch. 
sorry this is so quick but i'm not very into writing long entries,
later"

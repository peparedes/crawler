He had a very cheeky look about him and a really cute grin!
He told me his name was Pedro, and I couldnt help but laugh!
He told me he really liked man u, thought david beckham was a pillock and we got on really well!
I told him me name was Jenna, and he asked me if i wanted a drink, so he went out of the bar n down the shop n bought me a vanilla coke-what a melon! But hey he made me laugh!
He came back in with his bird, she was a right laugh too, we all swapped numbers, and if I can or he can find me a fella, we're gonna all go out!!

Hes a right laugh n him n za make a cutie couple!!"

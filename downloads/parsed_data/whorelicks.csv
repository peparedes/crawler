"event","Right ! Hello hello ! what's all this shouting we'll have no trouble here and so on .. 
as i'm sure you're all aware i don't usually update this thing very often but i think seen as i've got some time on my hands and thursday was the best night of my life ( that's right it doesn't get much better ) it calls for a special update ;) 
Not sure if many of you know this but i love my comedies ( bet ya couldn't have guessed that ! ) and The League of Gentlemen is one of my all-time faves ( if not my fave ) and written and acted by 4 hilariously funny guys whoose show i've been enjoying for a few years now and this month they started another fab tour around the UK with their stage show "" The League of Gentlemen are Behind You! "" i booked tickets for two of their shows 1 at Scarborough and the next will be in Newcastle on the 9th of november . 
Now i went o the Scarborough show last Thursday with 2 old school friends who are also mad about the show , when we got there we quickly bought a programme ( a tenner but definetly worth it ) and found our seats which were surprisingly close to the front and got settled christmas music was played before the show started which i thought was creepy in itself considering the time of year and we also noticed that there was a bag in front of two empty seats which were in front of us , at first we thought that it must have been part of the show but by the time it had reached the interval it was still there and someone ended up taking it to security which was a little worrying . 
Anyway back to the show , it started with a bit of a sing song from The Dentons who sung ""The House Rules Song "" from the second series and finished off by whipping off their clothes to reveal naked bodysuits , one with tits and a lil rug and 1 with a big swinging  cock which was hilarious ! The next sketch was herr lipp with his favourite schoolboy justin ( this time played by reece ) who went through plenty of innuendos like how herr lipp liked football and didn't mind riding a hard tackle etc lol . Legz Akimbo theatre company were brill as usual ,ollie plimsole made another reference to his ex wifes new girlfriend harold and informed us that he would be holding auditions for the locals for his nativity play called ""communativity "" and told us about how we might remember him from his last show where he wrote a play about child abuse called finger bobs , which got two thumbs up . hehe . mike , geoff and brian were great in the first half too ! but Anne Hand the weird Bible Basher was the highlight in the first half she was supposed to be playing mary and came wandering aimlessly onstage , ollie plimsoles had to tell her where to stand when to come in with her only line "" i shall name him jeeesus "" which she couldnt get the hang of - this was also the part where reece and steve corpsed, reeces character was narrating the play and mentioned that the holy ghost came to mary , this was the cue for a man with a white sheet over him to come running up to mary and anne screamed and had a fit on the floor until reece found a wooden spoon and shoved it in annes mouth to calm her down , anne just got straight back up with the spoon still sticking out of her mouth and reece couldnt stop laughing ( has to be seen i guess ) the darkest part of the show was the fate of les mcqueen who had a bit of a monologue on his own b4 being led off to kill himself , there were also quick appearances by iris and judee , the charity shop workers and pop .The Caves guy was pretty funny too talking to us about how another child had died while he was on duty , i don't think Marks shorts could've been any shorter! 
Though the first half was great the second half was even better ( especially for me ) ;) in this half we saw the likes of Papa Lazarou who played the baddie and did a sketch from the second series where he asks if someones had any berievement and steves character comes up on stage and he ends up leading her off saying "" shes my wife now "" , Papa also keeps Hilary Briss in a mirror as a kind of snow white and the seven dwaves thing arguing with each other in rhymes , it was great to see hilary live as he was great in the film and seems to be as camp as ever .Pauline also started the show with ""it's raining pens "" chucking a few into the audience while she was at it , she also did a song with cathy carter smith who played her ugly sister which was great to watch . There was plenty of audience partiticpation too , especially with pauline she's simply made for panto there was plenty of ""he's behind you "" ""no he fucking isnt"" "" yes he fucking is "" . oh yeah and she made us help her look for mickey by telling us all to shout ""mickey love "" at which point Mark ran through the audience and my aisle with a load of sweets chucking them at everyone , Mickey then had to go visit doctor Chinnery to get help for his sick cow called Daisy . Doctor Chinnery's sketch was i think the best part of the show he did a quick examine with Daisy and said about how he'd need a volunteer to help him with Daisy and said "" this is a queer predicament "" and got off the stage and started walking through the audience going up to people and saying "" no you won't do "" and started coming down my aisle , next thing i know he turns round to me and says ""what's your name love? "" so i told him and he took my hand and said "" a big round of applause for holly please "" and i was being led onstage by Chinnery , we got up onstage and he asked me where i came from so i told him York and he said ""sorry "" so i said it again and he said "" no i heard what you said i just feel sorry for you "" i was so embarrassed but surprisingly calm , tried to make out my mates who were in hysterics but couldnt see anything because the lights were so blinding , he asked me grab hold of a bit of rope that was coming out of daisys arse and help him pull it out so i did a lil bit of acting and stood like i was going to put loads of effort in to it and Mark just pulled it out with ease , pulling out all these different flags and bodyparts till there was nothing left he asked me to put an overall on which he helped me with and put a mask over my head i was so scared lol , he then asked me to put my hand up the panto cows arse which i did , he kept telling me to put it a little further until i could feel all this liquid on my hand , i didnt realise what had happened till i saw Mark looking down and noticed a load of brown stuff allover my overall and on my hands to which he pointed out "" the shit has truly hit the fan "" and told me i could leave the stage . The next sketch was particularly funny for me again because the next two characters to come on were Charlie and Stella who were supposed to be the two halves of the cow , they started having a big argument and Charlie came out with "" well at least i didnt just shit on holly "" lol . can't really remember much more at the moment but Edward and Tubbs were great to watch too , as was Dean tavalouris the shit magician . 
Was so cool afterwards getting recognised by people in the audience and having people coming up to me saying "" you're my wife now "" lol we were going to go straight to the station afterwards but noticed the stage door on our way and decided to wait there for a bit the gents came out after a few mins of waiting and we were allowed to go down some steps and see them inside , i saw Mark Gatiss first and i still hadn't washed my hands so went straight up to him and said "" can i shake your hand "" it was great his face lit up and he said "" oh it's holly "" and grabbed my hand and showed it to steve who said "" oh this is holly is it "" which led me to think Mark might have said something about me during the show , i got to speak to all three of them as i passed my programme along to get signed , mark also added that he thought i was very good and reece said that the shit takes forever to wash off , so i thought i'd better ask what it was to which Mark replied "" it's theatrical  mud "" so just as well i didn't lick it ;) . It was fantastic ! because of the cow incident Mark also wrote a little personalised message saying "" to holly , it's a shit business "" which i'll try and get up on here asap . 
It's so good to know that they're not only hilariously funny but don't mind taking time out to speak to their fans at dvd signings or after the shows which is great and makes a refreshing change after the last couple of shows i've been to . 
So i definetly can't wait for the newcastle show now even though the Scarborough show can't be topped ( can't really think of anything better than standing on stage with 1 of your idols and then meeting them and being recognised afterwards ) 
So a big WHOO HOO ! to that and roll on the DVD  ;)"

"event","Hey there ! 

Well , this is my first post , spammy set it up for me so i thought i'd better give it a go ! not promising i'll keep up with it tho, i know what i'm like when it comes to diaries ! 
sooo anyway anyway anyway ... not sure what to talk about . had a bit of a boring day really , got up watched some not the 9 o clock new and big train 2 extremely funny sketch shows :) , my speakers for my i pod came 2day as well so i've been testing those out .using them right now actually bout time i started listening 2 some Stone Roses . off to the pub 2moro afterall and a very nice pub it is too , everyone should come visit it next time they come to sunny York . What else has happened ... oh yeah my sister got her GCSE results , the lil swot she is ;) got 6 B's , 3 C's and 2 D's i think that's right anyway . oh and had a phone call from a friend informing me that she's taken up a job as a lapdancer in Blackpool on the weekends so that was rather amusing , ah well each 2 their own lol . 
Just about recovered from a weekend of great music , will have to put some pics up on my webspace when i get time though the video footage is better quality , great footage of franz ferdinand and the zutons , they totally rocked i could just watch those two all day ! First band i saw was idlewild been really getting into their music lately since my ex boyfriend liam put a couple of their albums on my i-pod , saw them supporting R.E.M July too so they were pretty good , shame they were on so early . next bands i saw were Athlete and Embrace they were pretty good , nothing to get too excited about though . after that me and my brothers  ex  Carrie went to watch Turin Brakes only know a couple of their songs so went to watch Painkiller -such a cool song , oh yeh and we watched Ian "" king of Monkeys "" Brown arrive at the signings tent in a pink tracksuit , Carrie was planning to get his autograph with my brother and whisper in his ear ""Ian you're a legend "" but sadly it wasn't to be ! While trying to get hold of my drunken brother me and Carrie then went to watch Franz ferdinand who were of course great live , you could just tell how much more confident they'd become over the past year or two and were absolutely loving it . Carrie disappeared just before the end of their set to get ready to watch Ian Brown , while i made my way to the Channel 4 stage to watch The Prodigy and caught the end of The Hives , they were really entertaining , the lead singer guy talked like a preacher -very strange lol also met a nice lad there called Ed but he left me to see the Scissor Sisters * sniff sniff * ah well never mind lol , when he left i got talking to a couple during The Prodigy's set , they pretty crazy - will never forget holding hands in a circle jumping up and down to The Firestarter . 
The next day i'd got my bearings a bit more , could actually find my tent and knew where everything was by this point , surprisingly nothing was stolen however when me and Carrie were trying to sleep she heard some guy shout "" you keep running! "" so we're guessing that could've been my brother doing laps round the campsite ! he eventually turned up at 4am saying he'd been looking for the tent for 2hours , claiming he had hyperthermia and that he was a broken man , hehe . Found out the Zutons were going to be at the signings tent at 12.30 on sunday so made my way down there , the queue was already massive by the time i'd got there and by the time i'd got near the front of the queue they had to leave ,probs to get ready for their set on the main stage so i thought fuck it i'm gonna leave here with someones autograph and met The Bravery instead . had a wander around after that , bought  radiohead , papa lazarou and muse posters -wheheey! saw Jet after that , they were good but didnt know many songs so couldn't really appreciate it , saw The Magic Numbers perform video killed the radio star too which was pretty good . The Zutons were fab of course ! been searching for a t-shirt with them on in York but no luck . Thought i'd give The Bravery and The Kaiser Chiefs a miss after this and went to see Sonic Youth in the JJB tent , where i learned about Steve Coogan getting Courtney Love pregnant ( one of the guitarists decided to shout congratulations ) though still not sure if it's true or not , they were really good . went off to see The Doves after that , Peter Kay had been on stage shouting at people and accusing them of stinking of piss minutes before i'd got there so i was a bit gutted at missing that . The Doves were great live -will have to get their new album ! Made our way back to The Main Stage after those for Oasis , who were great to watch , my brother Mathew is such a big fan , he's seen them 10 times and was soo excitable , they sung all their hits and the Gallaghers started arguing in between one of the songs with liam turning to noel and saying "" i can't hear a fucking word you're saying "" before turning on the crowd to say ""what are you fucking ooh-ing at "" , enjoyed every minute of their set the lighting and everything was perfect right till the end when they did a cove of My Generation , only thing that pissed me off was that i wouldve probs appreciated it more if i was closer * damm my smallness!* . 
Any anyway anyway , needless to say it was a great memorable weekend and as Carrie would say "" God was truly smiling upon us "" . 
I shall leave you now ... partly to go for my tea... partly because i've run out of things to say but mainly because i just can't be arsed to write anymore !
 PS. Keep your eyes peeled for my website , called either ""Humourme"" or ""laughatfirstsite"" with the help of Matt Meadowcroft it's hopefully going to be a site for comedy ( you wouldn't have guessed it by the title would ya ! ) so that i can post my own sketches on it and others can post theirs etc"

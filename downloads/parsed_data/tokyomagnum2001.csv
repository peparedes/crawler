You are always angered easily and prone to
<br />moodswings. Your perspective on Life is in
<br />Black and White, you see the edges of truth
<br />and deceit. You loathe being misjudged by
<br />others. The reason for your violent behavior
<br />could be because you were once a depressed
<br />person, and kept most of your hurt inside.
<br />The hurt that you've locked inside your soul
<br />has come bursting out of you, resulting in
<br />this outcome. You long to end your misery(by
<br />suicide), but you are either too afraid of
<br />death or you are still seeking the reason for
<br />your Existence.

Your traits:
*Hurtful
*Angry
*Suicidal
*Lost
*Kind
*Violent
*Rectopathic

Your color: Black/ Crimson
Your Quote: ""Life is just one damned thing
<br />after another.""

"event","A guy went into a bar and met a nice girl. They have a few drinks and
soon wound up at his place, in bed. They're having a great time. She
was on top when suddenly she had an epileptic seizure; she was
shaking and foaming at the mouth.
Our uninformed male thought this was incredible - best sex he'd ever
had. He finished, but she is still shaking and thrashing about with
her seizure.
He began to get nervous and took her to the emergency room. A nurse
asked what the problem was and he replied, ""I think her orgasm's
stuck!"""

"event","finally all the tile and lamanent flooring is down and i can rest without having to bust my ass inbetween work and on days off.
i finally have 2 days off in a row after 4 and 5 day stretches with only 1 day off. :). thursday and friday off and debating what the hell to do. 
wash my car, fix up my room, cut my hair. go to the credit union, hunt for a computer desk, spot out the ladies, cut the grass and most importantly.... finally sleep in for once in 3 weeks.





brennen seems to be doing pretty awesome with the band providence. www.providenceband.com

hes doing 5 shows a week and i checked the schedule, so it looks like if i can squeeze out early enough, i can see him sunday night. kind of dull not hearing from, or seeing him day to day, but i understand hes pretty busy and its all gravy baby. glad to hear hes doing great and best of luck in makin it big.

"event","everyone piles into Brennen's SUV to head off to YBOR to see MSI at the Masquerade. We missed the I-4 exit, why i don't really know, and ended up on Fl Ave. took that to martin luther to nebraska to 7th..got there at about 5:45 (doors at 7). there's already a long line of people, and tickets have been sold out for quite a while. we see LynZ, msi's bassist, walking down the street. 

so, there's the six of us..ticketless. we get ""x'ed"" and as ian proclaimed, equaled half getting in. knowing that it was basically impossible to find people selling six tickets, seeing people couldn't even find one *and also no one even wanted to give up 1 ticket for great oral sex* we decide to go to starbucks.

While we were at starbucks we saw a little girl drag some old guy into Victoria's Secret *shudders*. Disturbing sight as she looked maybe... 17 and he looked at LEAST 40. We went to some clothing store, went up and down the escalators. talked to some guy in some cd store. Tickets were sold out there as well. took awesome photos in the photo booth courtesy of Ian. went up another downward escalator.

Then we stood on a bridge for a while. I had a nice view of some hotties walkin by *looks around innocently* Then we all decided to check out what was goin on at the masquerade. 

I spotted brock and heather so we headed over and i made conversation with them. We informed them tickets were sold out and they decided to leave. But us, hell no, we are rebels and were going to figure out a way out of the situation. So we go out back (by the back door of the masquerade) and this guy looks out and sees us, then joey tries to get in. then we all sit on the stump looking sad. 

then, this guy with long dreads, a huge septum piercing, and other piercings all over walks out Brennen knows him, he used to be in some local band named Calm. So he was asking about getting us in and stuff but he said he couldn't but that MSI's tour bus was, ""right over there"" and that ""we should go knock on the door or something and see what we can do.""

so we cross over to the parking place which is by the bus and Kristie takes out her sharpie and writes on jimmy's stomach, ""we need six tickets *heart*"" and he stands by the bus dancing around acting like a monkey or something. And then he sings to people about giving great oral for tickets.

the guitarist (tub ring's guitarist filling in for steve, righ? cause he broke a hip or something) comes out and we ask him if he can get us in cause we're all SO FUCKING COOL, he says he'll see what he can do. so he calls MSI's manager manager and BAM BEOTCH!! we were guest listed. we were on msi's guest list VIP hoes! we heard jimmy urine talking to the manager and we met tub ring/msi's guitarist. it was wonderful.

so we go up to the door and i play lead and say, ""ya we're on the guest list"" for who? then everyone joins in ""msi"" names? ""name off everyone in our group"" okay, go in. craziest thing in the whole fucking world.

so we get in and SMB is okay. then crossbreed comes on and even though ive never heard that band i thought their live performance was very good. I begin moshing around with everyone and acting crazy enjoying myself. we then discover that the guy from Calm, is Crossbreed's bassist. So that was cool that we unkowingly met crossbreed's bassist.

msi was awesome. they opened with 'seven eleven' and ended with 'bitches'..they did tornado, golden eye, faggot, except 'i hate jimmy page' which i heard plenty of rant about. 

jimmy urine ran around in his underwear. we all know we wanted him to whip out his dick whether we'll admit it or not. they are a great band and i had an awesome time getting my ass kicked in a mosh pit in the middle of the pit *fell down a count of 6 times* i now am the proud owner of a multiple bruised left leg, lump on my head, stiff neck and sore back.

afterwards we went to get gas and drinks, then mcdonalds, and decided to go around in a big circle to south tampa on dale mabry because were cool like that and wanted to get lost for a couple of hours :).


this has been the greatest comeback in concert history.
from being ticketless and having no hope of getting 6 tickets, to meeting a bassist, guitarist and tour director for 2 major bands and getting guest listed and not having to wait in line to get in :)."

"event","i was originally going to buy 2 sticks of 512mb DDR ram either pci 2100 or pci 2700 which danny informed was compatible with my system......

i think i want a new system altogether..... i am willing to spend up to 800-900$ on one. i have 600 something in stock i can take out any time seeming i wont be working at wal-mart much longer anyways.... and 300 some dollars in my bonus check, on top of my regular pay check which i should have 300 something....... thats how i figure this price range...


i want at LEAST 512mb DDR SD ram..... but i may squeeze 1gig. also processor... p4 3.2 or higher preferably 3.4ghz...... dont really care how many gb's the hard drive is. i want a video card along with it.. im used to the nividia geforce cards so a card is a must..... i dont need a monitor, keyboard, mouse or speakers as i already have some attached to my monitor and a 5.1 surround sound headset on top of that.....

so p4 3.2 or higher
any amount of hard drive space.
video card- preferably one of the newer makes from nvidia geforce
and possibly sound blaster or some sort of sound boost 
price range up to 800-900 just depends how good the system appears to me.....

any and all suggestions welcome.
i also know its cheapest to order each component seperately online, or scouting stores then put it together myself.... im sure danny and john could be a big help to me."

"event","well, I have finally been raped in the ass by a trooper. metaphorically with a 155.50$ ticket for doing 69 in a 55. *lucky me, because normally i do around 80-85* but thats besides the point...

after getting away with nothing but dozens of eyeballs and evil glances from the police force, my day has come =\.

i admit 100% fault because well... iwas speeding... but theres always another side to a story so i will let you all know.


i left my house at 1:20 because usually takes me 20-25 minutes to reach the campus for a 2pm class. well, i was informed that i had to deposit a check into my dad's bank account, so scratch the extra 10 minute gap.

so, im still in good time to be at class on time for my ethics exam. im driving along powell road doin my usual 75-80 in the 55. then the light turns red just after nature coast... and then...... 18 fucking buses pull out right in front of me... im the ring leader behind these 18 yellow pieces of shit on wheels, and, me and just about everyone else behind me are getting edgy because there are 18 buses in front of us and were goin about 45 in a 55. 
we approach broad street for the left turn and ALL 18 of the buses are also turning left onto broad street..... about 5 cars behind me decide they don't want to wait any longer and off road it past the line of buses and take a right. so i think about it for a 5seconds and decide to do the same because there is a u-turn just up ahead about a 1/8 of a mile. 
this is the part where i get it rammed right up the ass. i speed up to 69 to get into the U-turn lane, take the U-turn and continue on my way for a good couple minutes...

the trooper pulled off the grass and got behind me...and nothing at first, so i thought i was clear... then about 2 1/2 minutes later the lights go on and im thinking to myself what, the hell???? why is he just NOW deciding to pull me over.....meh...



pull off to the side of the road hand over my license and registration then the trooper asks me the obvious question everybody gets, ""do you know what ya did wrong?""
the first thought in my mind was, ""ya, i forgot to stop off at dunkin donuts and get a cream filled one to go with those glazed eyes bud.""
then i told the trooper, yes sir. i was speeding and you caught me, you saw me zip past that army of buses along with everyone else and i was the unfortunate one this time.
after he writes up the ticket in his vehicle for 10 minutes he comes back to my car and sees me looking at some computer programming work and says to me, ""ahh good student still studying even before class. i like that.""

then i think to myself, ""ahh good trooper want another donut to go along with your 300 lb. fat ass?""

but i say, ""thank you sir, i know i will be cautious from now on. it wasn't worth rushing to class because im already 3 times late than i would normally be. and the trooper says, ""good, you take care then and be safe bud.""

then as i creep back onto the road i think in my about flicking him off 15 times and giving him 'oinking' gestures.


well, thats my rant. now i get to pay 155.50 ticket and spend another 30 some dollars to take a course so i don't lose any points and my insurance rate doesn't go higher."

I actually went to all my classes this week to find that the classes haven't gotten very far in their subjects... went to psychology with paskins. i love that class, we had a great discussion today on positive/negative reinforcement. she convinced me today that no matter what happens you never ever physically punish your child. And I mean punish along the lines of slapping their ass and sending them to their room, whippin out the belt, stuff like that. Prior to the class discussion I felt that if a problem such as a 5 year old child threatening their mother and slapping or kicking her or throwing a toy at her that sometimes it is absolutely unavoidable and the mother or *usually the father* needs to take action by slapping their arm or spanking them and letting them know what they is absolutely wrong and sending them to their room. Mrs. Paskins convinced by use of her own experience with her sons. Her sons are very successful, great individuals and she never once hit them. She said the most she ever did was a quick jerk when one of her sons was only 18months old and walked into the street. She gave a forceful tug to pull her kid off the road, but not in an overly aggressive manner and let her child know. I don't feel like typing the grocery store example which I thought was a brilliant idea both as a parenting idea and the way the human mind works and the psychology aspect of it.

Then, came home and i did more computer work and fried my brain. I drove Brennen to work and I feel bad, because I know i made him a few minutes late. Talked to Sandy, of the assistant managers, to see if I was given either Friday's or Saturdays off and it was already in the system. She kept giving me bullshit, like, well im not Marvin your assistant manager for your shift so I cannot change anything. Sooo.....*stupid bitch*... I kept asking her to just look and that there is no need to change anything... Just look in the system to see if anything is in... She was about to, but then she threw the stupid shit about her not being by asst. manager so she can't change anything.. and then.... there is no time... and then... go check with Marvin whenever he's in again. So, wtf?, im going to have to show up tomorrow just to find out if I am actually working tomorrow or if i'm off saturday.. That defeated the whole purpose of me going up there. oh well. 
After that little endeavour, I decided i needed some nourishment and chinese food would DEFINETELY hit the spot..mmMmmmMmmmmmmmMMm soooo gggooooo.. shit!... I dont have my wallet... 
I do a quick drive home to search for my wallet... YES I FOUND MY WALLET, now for some... FUCK!!!!!! no house keys and everybodys gone!!!! DAMN IT!!!

So, I had no money and no food to buy :(. I went ghetto-ness and used the change in my cars ash tray and bought a couple snacks from the snack machine.

After my nourishment troubles I walked right into my computer apps. class and took the 2nd exam right off the back and got a 98%, after having not shown up for 2 classes.I also had 2points extra credit from a project I did 3 weeks ago so 100% is really what i got.
Ya, who rocks... ya... definetely the asian! bizzitches A's in muh classes,  and I decided not to show for a 2 week stretch.

2 storied up above the noise of crowds.
I am oblivious to this endless frivolous drought.
Hanging for your comfort; put aside for your reasons.
Looking down on this situation I wish I was leaving.
Nothing gone right except night to day, cut me loose to lose your spite parade.
Cover your eyes to see it your way.
Open your ears and ignore what I say.
It will all come out to play and run to another side.
That's when time has come to expose your true side.
I'm bound by your dilusion
Drowning in your solution
Taken back by your actions
10 miles from where it all started one verse ago.
All my expenses payed with good entensions on a reverb I owe.
I wount sit down with you cause I cant stand anymore of this.
3 times ago, 2 more to go, 1 foot in the grass of endlessness.
Take my hand and I'll show you where I am coming from.
If you don't show me now forever hold your tounge.
Hide yourself in a state of dispise.
When you see yourself in someonelse's eye's
I wount be so quick to release tid bits as I see them.
I wount be here to see them; I am going away from here.

Leaving the yard 
no where to go
no where to turn
seeing no one i know
bag in my hand
creep thorugh the dark
hope the damn dog don't bark
*running away
try to escape my past 
running away
stopping the pain at last
no one i know
will let me let go
running away
wake up see the day.*
feel the rain pouring down my back
my hair sticks to my neck
needles stab my heart
as i see my bro. and i
parted on our way to freedom.
we're spotted
400 miles from home
no one i know
is anywhere around
where's my boy
why can't i see him
where'd he go
i don't wanna know 
who turned me in
sitting in the car
watch the trees go by
wonder where i am
and when the pain will start again
why couldn't i go
why did i fail
why am i being put
back in a place of pain and hate
i miss the days when i was...walk in the door 
everyone is there
tears are streaming
down cheeks as i hear my name
all i can ask is where's my brother
they tell me he's gone
he's in jail trying to make bail
lemme go see my bro.
i wanna know that he's okay
after all those long hard days
home again 
everyones safe now
no more runnin' 
just talkin' and cryin'
livin' and dyin',tryin' to be myself"

~*Dreams*~Touch your skin
Hold you tight 
Feel your heart race as we fall
Feel the pain 
Close your eyes
Open your mind as we crawl.


Its nothing that you havent seen its more or less a dream within a dream.
Is something wrong I cant complain its just an image written out in vein.
I feel the blood its dripping through another day I hate to deal with you.
I put the knife against the skin and I squeeze as the blade slides right in

Somethings wrong
Hide your thoughts
I wont bother anything
So confused
What is this
It feels so good burn or sting

Its something that I love to feel, sometime I wish that it could be for real.
Nothings wrong my scars will wear, as my heart will slowly start to tear. 
I wonder now if this is right,
I look around but never see your light.
I feel the blade its sinking down, I feel the blood and i begin to drown.

Shut my mind
Hide my pain
Cover up what keeps me sound
Hate is not
Taking me
I look for you all around 

Well yeah i got bord last night and wrote that after i got back from the Y with my dad and had that on my mind when i was bench pressing! lol ahaha funny stuff i tell yah! but alright comment you whores! oh yeah IM UNGROUNDED TODAY! LOL ROCK ON! im going tanning after skool and then to get more minutes! yes! call the cell! 6702332! I LOVE YOU GUYS!

Now or Never
 
We have no use 
For the truth 
Now's the time for us to lose 
Who we are and how we've tried 
Taking every step in stride 
It's now or never to decide 
In this time are we loving 
Or do we sit here wondering 
Why this world isn't turning around 
It's now or never 
In this way are we learning 
Or do we sit here yearning 
For this world to stop turning around 
It's now or never 
Where's the truth 
For us to use 
Cause all we seem to do is lose 
Who we are and how we've tried 
Are we all the same inside 
It's now or never to decide"

Erupt again ignore the pill
I won't let it show
Sacrifice the tortures
Orchestral tear cash-flow
Increase delete escape defeat
It's all that matters to you
Cotton case for an iron pill
Distorted eyes when everything is clearly dying
Burn my knees and...
Burn my knees and pray

E-motion sickness
Distorted eyes when everything is clearly dying
Burn my knees and...
Burn my knees and pray
All my friends say
""Get up get up get up....""
E-motion sickness
Addict with no heroine
To idle with an idol
Good things will pass
It helps with excess access

~Miss You Love
Millionaire say
Got a big shot deal
And thrown it all away but
But I'm not too sure how I'm supposed to feel
Or what I'm supposed to say but
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
And I miss you love
Make room for the prey
Cause I'm coming in
With what I wanna say but
It's gonna hurt
And I love the pain
A breeding ground for hate but
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
Remember today
I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
I love the way you love
But I hate the way
I'm supposed to love you back
It's just a fad
Part of the... teen... teenage angst brigade and
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
Remember today
I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
I love the way you love
But I hate the way
I'm supposed to love you back"

~*Alone in my darkness~*
By: me (wrote it last night)

Im fighitng all this stress
Tired in my soul
Nothing can fill this hole

This pain is deeply engraved
I only wish that i could end this
Im missing out dont you agree?
Its to late to be saved
By the time you've heard this
It'll all be over in me

Im dying because I cant breathe
Or maybe its because i dont want to
There is no time to think so why should i bother
Dont feed me your words
Dont tell me it hurts
Cause you dont know how i feel
Cause right now i am not real

Tight fit straightjacket
Around you i cant move
Bowed down and tied up
Soon i can remove
Myself from me
And ill be what i wanna be

For what reason is there to continue
All but she, nothing is left to see
By the time you've heard this
It'll all be over in me

Im dying because I cant breathe
Or maybe its because i dont want to
There is no time to think so why should i bother
Dont feed me your words
Dont tell me it hurts
Cause you dont know how i feel
Cause right now i am not real

Im pushing and screaming
Hitting and flailing Im
Torn and ripped open
Mourning and Encrypted
This you should know by now
I dont feel out loud

Please help me because I cant breathe
All the pain rises and the pressure steams
Im alone forever and lifes getting harder
I cant handle this 
Not ready for this sorta thing
This something cant be answered by anyone
This is me and i am the only one"

I mean, of course many have warned me and many have told me their views of it, but for some reason it never actually occurred to me. Seeing that I do feel the same as they do now, it makes me feel a little dumb and especially ignorant towards such a matter. Instead of dwelling on how I was too blind to see it, the next step needs to be thought of and action must be taken.  For such an imminent situation, it seems very necessary. I guess the question of what to do is visible, but, as always, I don't know.

I just, don't know."

Josh got another tattoo .. it's fucking ugly.. everyone else likes it but frankly .. whispers... it's UGLY


Christmas is in EXACTLY <b>ONE</b> week!! I shall be going over to Josh's families for the holidays.. which would be rock on .. I suppose. Josh is getting more done on his new tattoo on Thursday.. cause ya know .. he has the money for [slash NOT] ... and I'm going to be MIA that day because I want nothing to do with it... can't fucking wait .. > - <

On another note.. isn't Wentworth Miller gorgeous? :p

So yeah.. definitely haven't even began Christmas shopping at all.  Nick and Jen are leaving for Kentucky for Christmas.. but not before getting WAAAAAA-sted. ^-^

My dear OZZIFER is in Cali .. I wish I could talk to her. And Vic, I dunno.. right around now, I kinda feel that I can't talk to him.. it's like I'm afraid that whatever I say to him.. he'll tell Cliff or something.. :-/ and that really sucks because Vic's definitely one of my best friends.

Well I think that's a pretty good update... I feel bad for my counselors and psychologists.. it must suck to listen to the trivial problems of hypochondriac's all day.


Hrm... yeah so if I don't update before Christmas..

I thought I should update.. perhaps my example will wield others *cough* VIC *cough* into updating theirs... and letting me meet his girlfriend!! Strange people are talking to me again... and my spit tastes like meds. weeeeeeirrrrd.

Things have been going a little rocky at times. Scattered fights .. they seem to be increasing in volume but maybe that's just my view of it. Things are bothering me more than they should. Example: last night I gagged and almost puked because of something very vulgar and I think I'm gonna stay away from it for a while.. so it can get clean or something.

There are just some times when I wish I could have someone different. Someone who wasn't so promiscuous, it's that sort of stuff that makes me want to barf all over and break it up. It's really depressing. I don't even wanna be touched nor close.

I've been starting to take my pills again since it feels like I'm going back into that downward spiral.. it's been helping a little. But I think I'm starting to develop a tolerance, which is why I stopped in the first place.

"event","So yeah it's my senior year, and I've already missed about half the days .. that's bad since I'm in jeopardy of not graduating on time. And everyone tells me I'm so smart, I just wish I had the intellect to motivate myself. Josh asked me today, what my dream job and place would be. I was kind of stunned at the question, I thought for a while and all I came up with was Market Research, which was not in my mind for the past 17 and a half years of my life. It shocked me that I even said that. But it's weird because I can nail it on the head where I'd want to be. But I don't know what I want to do. Geez, the future.

So I think I know what I AM good at, being a housewife. All I've been doing is cleaning, cooking and watching my little brother. A lot of people have asked if he was my son, whatever.

I'm happy I got cable and internet back, but then I really don't care at all either. I'm kind of glad cause I can keep in touch with people, I guess. I'm not really much for the phone lately. Although, I have to give Vic a call up soon. Remember, as soon as I get a car, AJA Noodle, you and me. I can't wait. I love hanging out with Vic, I think he's one of the few people who actually appreciates what I have to say.

So I was reading a magazine at the local Saturn dealership and I found out the latest in what scientists, biologists, are researching in doing. They're trying out growing actually muscle tissue by taking a thin piece of silicon or some sort of biofilm and stretching it to emulate a tear and having the cells from tissues rebuilding themselves and reconnecting the piece of tissue, creating more tissue.

strange. well I think that's it bubye."

And I think we're planning on kidnapping Vic on Friday and taking him to Charlotte Beach. Maybe leaving him there haha. On Saturday we're planning on kidnapping him again and making him go to Austin's going away party with my little brother. Of course we'll be there too. I think we're kidnapping him out to Kendall as well. I'm sure he'll have a lot of fun there. Hopefully Cliff can come too.

I think I might be getting my car after we move which is super sweet. It's weird because no matter how much I hated living in Penfield and all or most of the people in Penfield, I'm really going to miss it here err there. I've had a lot of great times in Penfield. Wow. Well it's change.

It seems like everyone's moving and change is just happening all around me. It's kind of cool but depressing. Josh said something sort of enlightening to me though, it was quick but it really stuck in my mind. Change, it's the only definite thing. It's true. The only thing that's constant <i>is</i> change.

Well I'm moving in three days. Big news to me since I only found out today and the first person I told was my Ozzifer .. woke her up too. hehe. I also don't have the internet as of now too. I'm updating at Ozzie's right now. She's going to be helping me start packing today. So weird. I'm gonna be a Fairport dweller. But I'll still be going to Penfield which is all right.

I got some applications at the mall too also talked to the guy at Fruit and Salad. Hopefully Zeb remembers to put in a good word.

That's all. I must be off to pack now.

I smoked for the first time in like 5 or 6 months. My tolerance has definitely gone down to nothing. But it was pretty sweet anyway. I had a good time.

Today, Josh and I had to wake up waaayyy early like around 7 am to run some errands for his work. Then we got back to my house at around 2 and passed out. I made him some waffles and they were awesome .. I'm so great at garnishing. ^-^

Things seem to be going pretty well. I haven't taken my meds since Thursday and with the exception of a few depressing and anxious times, it went pretty well.

I can't wait until tomorrow is over so I can be school free for about two weeks. Of course then it's back to summer school for Cosmetology.. which I'm actually looking forward to.

I want to get some tanning time in so I don't look pasty for summer either. I can't believe how great I feel. Well time for bed now. Then tomorrow, my US History exam, babysitting and hearing from Josh about work.

He's sort of talked to Josh on the phone and he wasn't being an ass, coming from Josh that is, I was asleep.

Josh and I are probably going over Cliff's tonight, just to visit. Afterwards, I think we're going to his mom's, maybe, and on Saturday to some YMCA kids thing. I'm not really looking forward to hanging out with his grandpa but it'll definitely be better than sitting around at home. Of course, I have to babysit again, and the next day.

It was definitely a parenting experience. We took the two to Blockbuster's and rented out VanHelsing, House of Flying Daggers and Fight Club, the videogame. Josh and I put our ""kid"" in two shopping carts and raced around Tops, getting popsicles and Cheetos. It was a lot of fun and the two were wearing bandanas the entire time. They had a lot of fun in the car too, I think we all did. So we played videogames and watched movies until they fell asleep, which was late.

Saturday, Josh and I played around with them and then we took them to the playground. That was very tiring. We dropped Austin off at his mom's boyfriend's house and my brother back at my house. We left when I got the okay to and went to Nick's for some drinking. We both got wasted and went back to his dad's house and passed out on the floor.

The next day, I was awakened by my mom calling Josh's to yell at me about not being home or something and her wanting to ask me a question and we agreed I'd be home by 5. Well we watched House of Flying Daggers and time passed by a lot quicker than we thought and it was 4:30. So I was fucked. We left immediately and after stopping to get gas and cigarettes at a bunch of places, we arrived at my house around 6:45. I found my sister in the shower and my brother missing. Well my dad took him to work with him and he was really pissed about it. Josh and I picked my brother up from my dad's work and took care of him until about 10. Josh left and my dad came home, oddly not pissed at all.

I made a CD today of really good songs to listen to when you're stoned, but they're good songs anyhow. I'm kind of thinking of getting back into the greenery, mostly because I miss the feeling these songs give me. But I think I should stay dope-free.. eh.. maybe I'll have days with exceptions. Hopefully I'll see Adam this weekend, which I think I will, it was a lot of fun hanging out with Adam, Nick, Eric and Erin.

I miss hanging out with Vic, Cliff and Molly but it's just too awkward for me now. Also, Josh and I have been busy or he doesn't have that much gas so it's hard for us to drive out there. I feel really bad because all of this awkwardness is my fault. It just sucks because it feels like our friendships will never be the same. It's a big bummer.

I found my wallet today, it was in my dresser. Finding it made me pretty happy because I thought I lost it or my dad found it and he would rub it in my face that I was disorganized and irresponsible. I also saw some pictures of some people who had already graduated. I saw Carly and Kathryn. They had really good senior pictures. I also saw Steve's senior pictures, that was weird. It was like an array of emotions, pretty odd. It was like that sinking feeling you get when you really like someone and of dread yet there was also happiness from our time together.

I kind of want a Civic or something small and zoomy. Zoomy.. yeah. But I'll be happy even if they get me a car like Josh's.. I need a car and badly. I think the medication isn't working or I'm starting to grow a tolerance for it because it doesn't seem to be working. Wow I can't concentrate for the life of me. I'm tired.

Josh and I made a plan for this weekend. First he's coming over and we're doing my Physical Education project which is geocaching in Harris Whalen. Then we're bringing Steven, my little brother, to his dad's and we're watching them until Saturday. Which in that time we'll be winging it on activities.

So Memorial Day weekend.. Josh picked me up around 7-ish on Friday. We went over to his dad's house. From there we went to Nick's house and chilled with him, Eric and Adam. Eric and Erin are now dating which is odd. And Adam was fucking awesome because he just is. I think Kaylea and her friend came over too with 'I <3 Dick' shirts on. It was pretty disturbing. We played some beer pong and Adam threw it like a maniac which no 3-dimensional sight and Nick sucked so Josh and I won twice I think.

On Saturday, we slept over at Josh's dad's and I don't think we did much during the day. Josh was sick so I felt really bad because I think I got him sick. We rented out Team America and never finished watching it so that sucked a lot too. That night we hung out at Nick's again, this time Erin was there and Kaylea and friend wasn't. So I was content, we played beer pong and Josh got really wasted. Josh, Nick and Eric went to do some illegal actions. Adam went home. So it was Erin and myself at Nick's, and Erin was all pissed off about what they were doing while I didn't care because I wanted to go too, but I didn't want to leave her alone. So after they came back, Josh and I stayed there for a little bit and then left Nick's, did some funny shit which I enjoyed thoroughly, and went back to his dad's house.

Sunday was a lot of fun. I love Josh's nephew, Austin. He's the absolute cutest kid I've ever seen and his speech impediment makes him even cuter. Josh and I ended up watching Austin for the day and it was a lot of fun. First we played video games. We then brought Austin to the park, where he got mad at Josh for falling and got rocks stuck in his pants and proclaimed he would steal me from Josh. We then went back to his dad's house and gave him ice cream, and dinner and boy can he eat. I think he ate more than Josh did. We visited Cliff and Vic too but didn't stay because they had to work.

On Memorial Day, which was Monday, Josh got his weight set out of his trunk and it made such a difference in gas efficiency. We went over to his mom's for Randy's picnic / ""get together"" and missed it because we were late. Afterwards, we went over to Josh's dad's girlfriend, Jeanie's, for dinner. His dad made porkchops and they were awesome. Jeanie lost her emerald in her ring and freaked but I found it on the kitchen floor which was cool. Then Josh, his dad, Jeanie and I played Sorry and Jeanie won and called me a bitch, it was pretty funny.

All in all it was a pretty fun weekend. I was taking my medication and I think it helped a lot. I didn't lose my temper like I usually do or jump to conclusions or was sad. It was like I was coked up minus the nasty taste and the sniffing."

I had a really good day today, well so far at least. I didn't have English because of an assembly and I really only went to 2 classes. I borrowed a GPS unit from the Athletic Department so I could go geocaching and get my final project done and over with. It seems like no matter how much I clean my computer screen, it will ALWAYS get dirty within the next day.

We had a little tea party today in art with the tea cups and saucer we made in Ceramics. I made one that looks like a pail and the handle of the tea cup is a shovel and a snail shell. The saucer is part of the beach with a little water/tide and a starfish. I got an A+ on it but I think half the reason was because my teacher favors me. That was really cocky but whatever. hehe.

It's so nice out today and all I feel is tired but the sunshine is just gorgeous. I just want to go outside and bask in the sunlight like a cat or something. I hope it doesn't rain too much this weekend. I need to do my geocaching project.

Boy do I love that sun.

I haven't had much of an appetite lately either and I've lost a lot of weight and for me, losing even a little weight is kind of bad. I had this dream that my leg was broken and it didn't really hurt that much, I just couldn't put a lot of weight on it. It was gross though, the bone was sticking out and my shin was all twisted. Apparently it means that I can't stand up for myself, which is reasonable.

I'm sort of dreading today, Josh is coming with me to get my stuff back from my exboyfriend and who knows what's going to happen with that. I get to see Josh though, and usually I'm really all excited and happy and cheery and what not about it but today, it's like blaaaahhhhhhhhh. Well maybe I can cheer myself up. Heh.

"event","Today seemed to just drag on and on. It wasn't terrible but way too long. So I took my first dose of Lexapro last night because it might cause drowsiness and then I went to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night at around 3:30 in the morning and I was wide awake, there was no yawning or anything. I just opened my eyes and thought ""Did I even sleep?"" But then I couldn't get back to sleep so I'm really tired. I went to school and gave attendance my note of absence for Wednesday and told them I wasn't there because I was sick on Tuesday. Well we have to get this pink slip so our teachers believe us that we have an excuse and we didn't skip and we get it from attendance and that's what I needed. Well the lady wouldn't give it to me because some dumbass marked me present for Tuesday and Wednesday. So fucked up. Now I'm gonna get 3 or 4 referrals .. for ""skipping"" when I wasn't at school.

My history teacher's wife went into labor today, we think he's having two girls. After school, Josh called and we talked for a little bit. My ex-boyfriend, Jesse, IMed me on AIM today because I said I wanted my stuff back that I had left at his house. And he said he'd get everything to me, except for the cell phone. He's such a fucking fucktard. I hate him so much. I bought that fucking cellphone for him and he won't give it back to me. I don't even wanna fucking think about it because I get so pissed. Fucking pussy ass, scummy mother fucker. Ugh, thinking about it just makes me want to stab him in the face.

Anyhum, my mom had to work again today so I'm watching my siblings. It's so weird having my mom work because it feels like she should be there but she's not. Today, I cleaned up the whole house, kind of tidied up a bit. I made dinner for my brother, then I drew a bath for him and watched the OC while he was bathing and ""scuba diving"". I made him brush his teeth and read him a bedtime story before bed. It's weird because I feel like a mom now. Kinda messed up.. almost ironic.

I think I'm going to cut my hair or at least the part that's around my face. I really need to do my homework, I haven't had time because I've been busy watching kids all day, now I'm dead tired. I'm glad it's Friday tomorrow, I get to see Josh and I've really missed him. I got him sick so I think I'll make him soup or something. I think we're hanging out with Nick and watching a movie or something. I just want some alone time with him, it seems like we never get that anymore.

Ogs has left me for the cheese and beer state, also known as Wisconsin. I miss her already. She says she'll be back Tuesday, so she won't be gone for too long. Right now I'm contemplating whether or not I should stay up and do my essay or simply go to bed. I should do the essay because it was due on Wednesday and it might hold the key to my grade. But, my doctor told me I should keep a regular sleeping schedule as to not mess up the medication and I'm tired. I think I'll work on it for a little bit and then I'll go to bed, I'll be in bed by midnight hopefully.

"event","Today wasn't terrible. My mom let me use her car today, which was rock-on. She only let me do it because she was too tired to drive me to my psychiatrist appointment, but I didn't argue. I went to Cos this morning though so I shouldn't get getting kicked out anytime soon. I still need enough hours to pass though. I've missed so many days of school though, it's ridiculous and I still have a final draft of my research paper to do. That sucks in so many ways because I don't even have the rough draft on me or my notecards done.

After Cosmetology, I had some time to kill before my noon appointment so I went to Barnes and Nobles. I wasn't there for too long, but I got an application. Then I realized the time and left for my appointment. I got to the office and I had to fill out a bunch of forms because it was my first time seeing Dr. Chaudhri, then I gave them to the secretary and waited for my psychiatrist to come get me. So I waited, and I waited, and I waited some more.. and so it seemed that his idiot secretary didn't page him until I walked up to the desk to ask why it was taking so long. She told me she got ""side-tracked"" .. if by side-tracked she meant she was talking about recipes and how ""good-looking"" some guy at the grocery store was.

So he sees me and we have talks about stuff. He showed me a diagram of a brain and explained what was going on in my brain and in the ""average/normal"" brain.. they never use to word ""normal"" in fear that'll induce some sort of shock that you really aren't normal. Well now I'm on Lexapro for probably the next six to nine months. He recommended that I record my doings during the day, everyday, so as to see my progress.. so I'm just gonna do it in my LJ. He said he was going to wean me into the medication.. Huh.. Lexapro .. escitalopram oxalate.

So afterwards, I decided I had lots of time to kill before my mom had to have her car returned and I went back to Barnes and Nobles and read this book about the brain and mind stuff. Then I decided to visit Josh and I only saw him for a little bit.. probably less than half an hour. But it was really nice and I informed him that I was on anti-depressants. My mom called his house, yelling at me to come home so I did. Then Oggies called and we talked for a little bit and I told her that I was on Lexapro. She said she supported it and hopes that it will help. I love her.

So here I am now, babysitting my little brother. I have to give him a bath soon. And Josh is supposed to call. But that's really my agenda. I wish I had the motivation to go to school tomorrow. But I really need to, so I will.

That's it.

Hiang

"event","I'm so bored that I'm updating again. Today was pretty chill, nothing really important happened. I stayed home from school today but I can't do that anymore because I'll get kicked out of Cosmetology. Ogs and I went to Wegmans today for a little bit and had a talk about what was going on in my life. After I came home I thought about what we conversed about and about Darcie. I hope she is doing well, I haven't heard from her or seen her in a long while, probably since February. I feel like such an idiot and that I should've been around for her, it makes me want to kick myself in the face. I read some of her past entries in her journal and all I could hear was her voice in my head. Maybe I am just a dumb snobby bitch.

I think I should learn to voice my opinions in a nicer way, but it just seems like I can't or I don't know how to do it. It's not like I try to be mean to everyone or that I'm truly unappreciative, I'm just and idiot. I feel so dumb doing this, beating myself up and whenever something good happens to me, I always fuck it up somehow. Always, just like the fucking idiot I am. Everyone seems to be changing and going onto better things or taking care of themselves somehow and I feel like I'm just stuck in this hole. And all I'm doing is digging myself deeper. I wish I could change myself so badly, so I could please everyone and be perfect. I wish someone would be there to tell me that I'm doing something right in my life, but it just doesn't seem to be happening. Everything I do is always the wrong thing.

I always fuck something up. I won't admit that I'm wrong when I should. I didn't think before I spoke or acted. I should've done so much and been there for them but I wasn't. I should've cherished everything I ever had and I didn't, I wish I did so much. It wasn't that I didn't appreciate anything anyone did for me, it was just that I never showed it. I wish I wasn't so quiet about some things sometimes and I wish I was more confident about some of my opinions sometimes and learn to voice them but I can't. I'm so fucking stupid, like a little kid and I'm 17. I feel like I need to relearn everything and no one is giving me a chance and that every time I do something it's the wrong thing to do.

I'm so sorry for all the anger and pain I caused throughout my life. I'm sorry I pushed everyone away from me when I should've accepted your help or accepted that I was wrong. No one is wrong, everyone seems to be right about everything and I'm the one whose messed up. I'm the one who should've realized I was an idiot. I just wish I could start everything over and I wish I didn't dwell in the past. But I'm trying to learn from it and it seems I'm too fucking retarded to learn anything anymore.

I think I'm gonna go to bed now, it seems pointless to be awake anymore even though it's early. I'll probably wake up in the middle of the night anyway.


I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow. I think I'll be starting my medication tomorrow too, hopefully they'll help.

And my mom has work tomorrow but I'll be watching them alone tomorrow.. I just hope she gets enough sleep.

So I think I'm gonna look up the symbols of that dream.. courtesy of <a href=""http://www.dreammoods.com"">DreamMoods.com</a>


fight ~ inner turmoil
frustration ~ difficulty coping with a situation in your daily life
friend ~ aspect of your personality you've rejected but are ready to integrate them into yourself
depression ~ coming of bad news
despair ~ cruelties and hardships in the working world
fear ~ achievements will not be as successful as anticipated
panic ~ lack of control and power in life
rejection ~ lack of self-worth and alienation from others
black ~ unknown, darkness, mourning
white ~ purity, reawakening, new beginnings .. but in Eastern cultures means death and mourning
gray ~ depression
living room ~ the image that you portray to others and the way which you go about your life. It is representative of your basic beliefs about yourself and who you are
driveway ~ end of journey
car ~ need to turn efforts and energies elsewhere, your lifestyle is colliding with others, even in pleasant situations, you'll feel restless and uneasy
telephone conversation ~ need to confront an issue with that person
crying ~ release of negative energy
tortue ~ feeling victimized in a relationship
keys ~ opportunies


so it seems that in my waking life that I have a low self-esteem, lack of self-worth, and I'm depressed and I feel alienated from my friends and the people around me. And even in the best situations I'm in, I feel uncomfortable but soon I'll find what I'm looking for in myself and they may bring about a lot of change in my life and the making of new relationships and the end of current ones.


oh boy."

I'm sitting at the library right now. Next to band geeks and math geeks, and well I'm not feeling too cool myself, but well, what are you gonna do about it?

I went to the Lilac Festival on Saturday. It was decent, until it began to rain but even so it wasn't bad. We had a picnic in the woods and started a little food fight. It was fun until a dirty grape went down my shirt, not so fun anymore.

I had this INSANELY messed up dream Saturday night/early Sunday morning. Well, it was in the middle of the night, that's all I know. So Vic, Cliff, Molly, Josh, Ben and maybe even Zeb and I were all chillin at Cliff's house, in his living room. Josh and I got into a fight and then he said to me that he was sleeping with my friend Christina. And I said, ""What the fuck, you haven't changed at all!"" Then some time passes as we're both cooling off and I asked him who he really loved and could spend the rest of his life with. He replied saying ""You."" So I told him that he had to choose between Christina for me. Josh dumps me and I begin to cry hysterically. Everyone was making fun of me and calling me a stupid bitch because Josh dumped me, so I ran out of Cliff's apartment crying and I yelled at them that I was gonna go home. Then Cliff said ""How the hell are you getting home? You stupid bitch!"" And I started crying harder. Josh then threw me his keys and told me to drive myself home with his car because he didn't want me around anymore. So I get home and I'm lying in bed, still crying and all depressed, wish it wasn't happening to me. I go to call Josh and I pressed the talk button on my white phone and he was already on the line. He and Cliff then come over my house and we go to the National Guard. Weird.

That was where I woke up in the middle of the night. So messed up. Well I've gotta catch the bus to Cosmetology now.. I think I'll analyze it when I get home. Bubye."

Vic and Cliff are still really sick witch mono.. I hope I don't get it. I'm not really sure if I ever got mono in the past. I know I've been really sick for about a month or so. I think I'm gonna look it up and see..

OH WOW.. *SUMMARY* from WebMD:

Mono or Mononucleosis:

Young children usually get mono and it's ""as mild as a cold"".
When teens and adults get it, it's more severe.
Starts with flu-like symptoms then glands swell up and a fever develops, lasting up to 3 weeks.
Spleen swells up
The liver is affected in 95% of cases
In extremely rare cases, the liver fails
Most people feel better within 2 or 3 weeks but still suffer from fatigue for 2 or more months
Sometimes mono lasts for a year or so and cause recurrent attacks that become milder
Comes from the Epstein-Barr virus, which is a member of the herpes family of viri
AKA ""The kissing disease"" because it's spread primarily through saliva
Symptoms are severe fatigue, headache, sore throat, chills followed by fever, muscle aches.
After a couple of days, you get swollen lymph nodes, rash, jaundice, red spots in the mouth

Home Treatment:

don't push your body, if you're tired, take a rest

Rest in bed

Avoid contact sports and heavy lifting for 3 to 4 weeks / until doctor says it's okay

Take Tylenol or Advil.. no aspirin under 20

Drink plenty of fluids


I think I might have had mono like last year.. my doctor doesn't really tell me what I have. I remember I passed out in her office though and all I did was sleep and my lymph nodes were SO swollen. It sucked really bad.


But yeah that's all I have to say.. put another wrinkle in my brain.

I hope they get better."

And then I don't want to live through the week. It kind of feels like I'm just living for the weekend. Kinda depressing.

Let's have a brief recap of my weekend.. WITHOUT VIC .. ONCE AGAIN!! - . -

On Friday.. I went out to lunch/dinner/late-afternoon-to-early-evening snack at Perkins with Oggiez. Josh arrived to pick me up about 15 minutes after I got back. Then, Josh and I went over to Cliff's and Molly was there too. We decided to drink like we always do, and since I wasn't feeling great I only had about one beer for most of the time I was there. Then Josh decided to go snort some magic fairy dust aka YOU KNOW.. and LEAVE ME FOR LIKE AN HOUR. So I decided to drown my sorrows in cigarettes, Super Mario Kart, and more beer. Finally he comes back, apologizes, we leave for his mom's house and have a long fight in the car and basically passed out at his mom's.

Now let's remember that I can't sleep over at his mom's for reasons that I don't feel like going into.. So Saturday morning.. and I wake up at their house well, his mom's not too thrilled and his stepdad is even more pissed. Well things are a little touchy but ya know whatever.. then Josh had to mow a lawn and I helped. And that was the day really.

That night [and I'm gonna make this as OC like and lovey dovey as I can because it was AWESOME], after Josh finished mowing that lawn and the sun had just set with the pink and purple swirls amid the sky, he drives us back to his mom's. Then he gets out of the car and tells me 'Hurry! Hurry! We've gotta hurry!' and I'm thinking ""What???"" so he makes me run all the down the street to the beach. We both climb a fence and he catches me in his arms and carries me to the beach. We walk down the beach, as I was admiring the absolutely gorgeous setting, and continue to these huge asteroid-like rocks that were in the water. He leads the way through the rocks and we sit on a tree, watching the remains of the sunset and the horizon light up and seem to be moving farther and farther away as it grew darker. The calm waves were crashing into the rocks and we watched as the water sent in a pair of swans. It seemed like the perfect, romantic moment as we both watched the swans caress the horizon. Then, my love murmurred to me, ""I wonder, do you think they will come to us? HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!"" 

and totally killed it.

After that we went back to his mom's and we stayed in his room until probably 5 in the morning and ended up leaving to go in his car and drive to a parking lot by the beach and watch the sunrise and sleep there.

So Sunday morning, I wake up to people fishing and opening and closing car doors. It was damn weird. Then Josh and I had to be at his mom's by 9 am and we go.. basically half asleep. Then we go out to eat and shopping with Justin, his little brother. And we get back, play outside with his little brother for a little bit and go back inside, blah blah blah.. all in all I ended up entering the house at 1 am.

But Josh and I saw a meteor or something falling last night.. it was CRAZY. And pretty. I also saw a shooting star.

I think I'm gonna write a different entry about today."

You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on


I've turned into such an emo poptart.. ::slaps self and starts head banging to .. Matchbook Romance?::


Riiiiight well hum diddly dum..  Last night was terrible.  I couldn't get any sleep and there's just so much shit to be taken care of and done.  Apparently my dad might be moving out or something or leaving us.  And the topic of a divorce is back in the quarreling. I just want to get the fuck out of here. Soo fucking badly.

And the perfect timing that Josh decides to not be home or call me, is the time when I wish I had someone to talk to. Well thanks a lot buddy.

I don't think I could ever share how much shit I have to deal with anyhow.


But besides that whole thing, my day was pretty boring and I need a job. That's it."

Okay wow, I really needed to get that off my chest. So I feel a lot better.. by the way I'm pmsing still like a mother fucker. But now I'm fine .. well sorta.

So today I gave a facial to this girl and really that was it. It was a pretty boring day.. nothing really happened and the day kind of just dragged on. I watched National Lampoon's Van Wilder today with the EVER SOOOO HOT Ryan Reynolds.. so gorgeous. And basically slept all day like I have been doing so that's it really.

I'm going back to bed."

"event","So here's the recap on what's been happening since Friday:

<i>Friday</i>

I've been pmsing for about a week so I'm very moody and all I do is sleep. So Josh calls up and goes make plans with Cliff and Molly to see the movie.. well it ended up being that we didn't go see the movie and Josh was pissed cause he said I was a bitch for falling asleep.. or something along those lines. Once we arrive at Cliff's, all four of us are sitting around doing nothing having coke and rums and taking a couple of shots. When Zeb tells us to go to this party and so we go, it's a kegger.. not really a big party though. Josh and I played a game of beer pong and some fooseball with Molly and Cliff. And by the end of the night, I puked and Josh and I passed out. Oh yeah.. Chronos has grown *SO* much.. he's such a cutie!!

<i>Saturday</i>

Saturday.. for some INSANE reason, Josh had me wake up with him at 8:30 in the MORNING. We watched Blade Trinity. The action scenes were great but the plot was definitely dull. Afterwards, Josh and I were just sitting around and I tucked Chronos in because he was getting tired from playing. He looked SO incredibly cute because I made a little bed for him and put a corner of the blanket over him. Chronos looke liked he was a little kid or something. It was definitely cute. Josh resented it and called me weird and crazy. But it put a smile on Cliff's face when I showed him. And soon put a smile on Josh's when he actually looked at him asleep on the mini-bed, which was on the chair.. like a crib almost. But after that Josh and I had to go to Wegmans, by my house, to pick up my prescription. We stopped by my house to see Q and go to McDonald's and then back to Cliff's.

At around 4 or so, Josh and I said our good-byes and went to his mom's. Randy, Josh's step-dad, made us dinner and it was awesome. Probably around 8 or 9, Josh brought me to his cousin, Bill's house because he was having a little get-together/party thing. And let me tell you, there is no guy is more hip and happening than Bill.. with his Magic cards and Ouija board. But, Bill is just the nicest guy, so I really can't talk. I'm sorry to say that his party sucked because we sat watching Family Guy and then UFC, which I don't find interesting. Soon, I fell asleep or was trying to because Josh left his seat next to me to get closer to the tv. Yeah, I was pretty pissed. But soon we left and went back to his mom's, where Josh preceded to fall asleep. And I left at about 1 AM, after tucking him in of course. ^-^

<i>Sunday</i>

I drove over to Josh's house at about noon. After I arrived, I was quickly told that Jasmine, their cat, died. And it took a while, but Josh and I finally got up the energy to clean his room, which now looks great. We left to drop me off at home around 10:30 and visited Cliff for a little bit, then dropped me off at my house.


And today, I got a facial and a nap in during Cosmetology. It was an all right day all in all.

That's it.. I'm about to go hop in the shower.. and hoping that Josh calls me."

"event","I came home from school and took a nap.. and I woke up around 6:50 but I thought it was in the morning and I started flipping out about how I missed the bus to school but then I realized that King of the Hill was on and that it was actually evening time.

Ya know Cosmetology will never cease to amaze me on how it's actually a program and class where they TEACH you to be pretty.. and gives you more credit than English, Math, Science and History. Today, for homework, I had to find two hairstyles [a day and evening one] for Nicole's face shape. After, I had to find celebrities with the same face shape and write down what color her evening gown should be to best match her season.

It's insane how girly that paragraph sounded.

I get to see Josh tomorrow, which I'm pretty excited about. Hopefully we'll chill with Vic, Cliff, Molly and perhaps Emma this weekend too. I don't know how we'd keep in touch after Cliff and Josh moves, but we'd better. You guys are great people and even greater friends. I'll definitely miss some good times with you guys.

That's it for this entry really..

Oh and Vic .. please IM me and tell me what your plans are for this weekend."

"event","Today was pretty good, everyone said I looked really cute at school and they liked my outfit. Cosmetology was okay .. I have to work with Nicole though for a project but might as well grin and bare it. I had a pretty good day at the high school too.. all I really did was color. Then I got to see my baby, Josh, which was the highlight of my day, basically. Even though we only chilled for about 4 hours, I loved every bit of it because I love him ever so much. And we got to watch the sunset and it was just amazing.. that's really the only word I can find to describe it, it was amazing.

I'm all happy now. :D

So now back to Vic's previous inquiries : my hair is a slightly lighter shade of brown

I've been taking care of Q, Josh's cat, for a couple of days now and for some reason this cat will only eat wet food if it's fresh.. so now I'm having to only give her enough then put the rest in the fridge.. and do this about every 3 hours.

I have no plans for today nor the rest of the week really.. which kind of sucks .. a lot. Well that's it for now .. I think I'm gonna take some quizzes or surveys and what not.

Oh and for some reason my shoulders hurt / are really sore. I think it's from Saturday night from the glowstick-ing. But it's kinda fucked up that it still hurts. Okay.. anyhow... quizzes here I come!

"event","Well this weekend was a trip.. it began at about Friday and went like so..

Josh calls me up at about noon [I'm very good with remembering times and certain things.. as long as I pay attention or sometimes even when I don't :)] and tells me he's gonna come pick me up at about 3 to 4 ish. Comes to pick me up.. and we go back to Josh's apartment and actually go to Cliff's [his neighbors] to see Cliff and Molly [his girlfriend] and a whole bunch of other people. So basically the plan for the night was that Cliff, Josh, Roman [Josh's roommate], Vic [one of my great friends] and Zeb [acquaintance] were supposed to go to the bar and leave Molly and I at the apartments.. Now obviously Molly and I weren't too happy about that and in our own vindictive minds decided to concoct a terrible plan.

Molly and I were gonna to get some stuff and recreationally use it while the boys were gone and ""surprise"" them with our fucked-up ness. Well it seemed that the boys were leaving and we didn't have our stuff so Molly asked to borrow Cliff's car and certain misunderstandings happened and it ended up that Josh got pissed at me and Cliff was super stressed about it too. So I guess the boys didn't have a fun time at the bar at all because of us. So Cliff comes back and since we felt bad we just let him go back and gave him back his keys.. not using the car. At first we thought everything was better but they come back and Josh is still really pissed and won't even go back to his apartment to talk to me about it. I begin crying about it, being the baby I am. So Molly gets me to go downstairs and everything's all awkward so I leave crying.. by the way I'm also drunk so I'm much more emotional than necessary.. and Vic [whom I love to death] helps me out and gets Josh. Josh and I exchanged words .. this and that and things got better.. a lot better. :)

He just means so much to me and has taught me so much and just everything... it's too much to begin to describe.

Basically the night went great.. we were all drunk.. and Josh and I passed out at 1.

Well the next day was great, Josh and I couldn't wake up until 11:30, we went to take care of some business.. which we were late for.. and went out to dinner with his mom, stepdad and sister. It was great we went to Red Lobster. We come back and everyone is basically gone to the Rez so we're dead bored. Then Josh took Roman to some place.. I dunno where and these girls come over [super dee duper].. they're fucking gorgeous. Well one of them was.. the other wasn't so much lol. Josh comes back, does some things that I'm not too thrilled about it sucked really.. For a while. Well whatever.. time passed.. unnecessary shit happened... Vic, Josh and I ended up going to Melissa's [friend] and there we're drinking .. blah, blah blah.. and I got to learn how to do glowsticks. It was THE SHIT. :D

We got back to Josh's at about 5:00 am and pass out, basically. Well then next day, Josh and I get up at noon and bring Q [Josh's cat] to my house.. So then we go back to Josh's so I can help him move his stuff out and clean his room up. I did most of the work.. as usual.. he was watching 'The Contender'. So whatever I was kinda pissed about that. Then he took me home.

Got home at about 11:00pm, I think. Josh called me about 15 minutes later to check up on Q. I went online to talk to Oz and Vic a little. Played with Q.. write in this journal.

And now.. I'm going to bed.

Buenas Noches."

"event","Hello..

I just got out of the shower.. and, due to my lack of tired.. I wanted to post I guess.

I haven't in a while so here goes..

My vacation pretty much blew.. but I got to spend part of it with my baby.. without electricity.. lol. I'm thinking of getting back into attempting to make websites again.. mostly to help Victorrrr out..

I don't know.. this week was a little awkward I guess. Mostly with the lack of electricity and the excess of unnecessary drama. The only person I didn't get any drama or shit or dumb schemes [well few dumb schemes] from was my Joshua. Which I thank God for hooking me up with :D .. I'm hoping to stay with him for a looooong time. It's been 20 days since we've been going out and ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" and just about or nearly six months since we've been seeing each other. [maybe this one will make it past the six and a half month point] lmao.

I remember how he asked me out too.. ::wavy dreamy action with some trippy music::


It was on the Tuesday before Valentine's Day..

             I went over his house because I was sick.. like REALLY sick with the flu.. so I wouldn't've gone to school anyway.. so why not spend it at someone else's house? lol. Back to my flashback...... because of the events of the weekend before, we were going to roll on X.. again..

Instead of crushing it up and using it as a chaser to a line.. we just took two pills each instead lol and waiting for it to affect us as we watched Blade [ I think ] .. I kinda missed the blow.. but whatever.. anyhow.. so around 9:30 - 10:00ish.. Josh and I just decided to go into his room and into our own little ecstasy-driven world. With the jungle music.. black light and the ice cube massages going on.. it was heaven. And then we were just cuddling.. and he says to me.. ""So do you want to be my girlfriend?"" [what a romantic :)] and ya know this and that here we are lol...


.. you see.. ecstasy has NOT eaten holes in my brain YET!


all right.. well I forgot what I was getting to with this story but.. I'm gonna do something else now.. maybe change these outdated colors on my livejournal.. see YA."

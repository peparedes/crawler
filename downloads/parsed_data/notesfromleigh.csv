"event","School is almost over, next wednesday. Though i believe thatmind thinks that it already is on vacation. Senior year is a much needed thing in my life. I'm pretty sure im not got to take it to incredably seriously considering...ive taken too much at this school seriously. 

Was going to work but a lovely person took my shift so that i could study...so definitly going to take advantage of that and go to Helios. It's a little more peaceful than Cup-a-Joe. Culbreth and Christan are going to join. 

Tomorrow is filled with more studying...drama dinner..then who knows. Staying at Tricia's and don't have school on Friday. 

Exciting.

Anti-climatic.

to sit and watch something swing in and out of control. was there ever control? 
did you ever know the mind of me? have you looked twice at the picture? i doubt. if you did i know you would have done something. the hardest to accept is pain that almost is self inflicting...by not making a move. not moving my pon to get out of the way of you queen. you are the queen. i am the beginner. you are an intermidete. my level of skill in these games is too low to make a difference. a lucky move once in a while doesn't cut it. making the team was something of a hobby. nothing more. until you pushed me to be the best i could be. and i am still in your shadow. 

i am sick of the shadow, sick of the invisable lines i put up for myself, sick of your careless mistakes that keep you safe and in company.

"event","<P>Well hello everyone. Today has been alright. I woke up and definitely wished that i had the privledge of not going to classes but that will come next year i suppose. Went to them all (an improvment i thought). Then after school i watched the oc with tess followed by a nice walk to CVillage with Mallory. We didn't have a working lighter so we had to search out money. I only had $1.47 on me and she didn't have any money so we called Tess and Kris and they let us a couple of bucks. Lighters are expensive these days. There is drama in the dorms and my response (because i dont' know anything about it! not really i do but i am going to pretend i don't) is that <EM>narcs fucking suck</EM>. The End.</P>
<P>eekkk! exams are in less than 24 hours...&lt;3 you all, and good luck! :)</P>

I also gotta finish chapter 8 and 9 ids for my little study group for history. Tess is watching The O.C. at the moment and i wish to join her, but it is very difficult because i must restrain myself. I haven't done anything. I need nutella right now. it would save me. I sorta fixed a feeling today with a friend at home. Also FFHS graduation is June 3rd, i must go. Also SMS graduation is May 28th and i will of course be going. I think i will probably cry...i seem to cry alot at the end of the school year...whether it was good or bad...doesn't matter. I cry.

<P>Today is going to be okay i assume, i have alot of work i want to do before i go to sleep to start getting ready for these exams and i should pack some more of my room up. I think i am sadly taking down my Irish Flag today, sniff sniff. I can hear all of the seniors preparing for there parties of the end of high school. I absolutly can not wait until i can finally say good bye to high school. Hopefully these next 2 years will fly by quicker than the last two. I should go to chemistry now...that is definitaly an exam i am worried about. eek! </P>

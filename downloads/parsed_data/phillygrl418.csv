"event","ok time to get serious i know u guys are just itching to know waht china is like... umm well its different like everyone uses the bud or taxis. i swear ive already been in like 10 different taxis.  i dont know if u could say it means everyones poor its just i think they spend their money in different ways.  for instance everyone here (i hate to admit) dresses cooler.  theyre more formal sometimes but in a cool way.  like they have awesome dressy style im jealous of. the best part are the skirts and shoes. everyone is dressed nice all the time.  another thing is the  hair. its liek dye madness here.  some for worse but mostly for the better. there are stores lining the streets like literally sometimes u can go for a mile down a street and see only stores and restaurants. 

i guess when im home ill reflect some more btu these are the biggest differences."

There are still some cars parked around the area that will be painted for the solar shade. Please move them ASAP if you DO NOT want overspray on your car. Please read the below message that was sent yesterday

Parking caution for Friday and Saturday December 4rdand 5th 

The steel structure for the solar project will get painted on Friday Dec 4th with primer and Saturday Dec 5th color coat. All painting will be conducted early in the day and should be completed by 11 am. Please use the sketch below to guide your parking choice. Anyone parking vehicles in close proximity to the painting should be aware of the possibility of overspray.

I am not a painter nor am a weather person so I do not know if overspray will hit your car. Please use your judgment and if you are worried please move your car.

So here it is all in one fell swoop.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">The hubby is doing much better; we go in next week to schedule the surgery to remove the rods in his bones. Then he is off to physical therapy. &nbsp;He isn&rsquo;t able to do much to help out around the house but I am so glad he isn&rsquo;t in as much pain as he had been in for the last month. Seriously there is nothing worse than seeing your loved one hurting and there is nothing you can do to help. I just don&rsquo;t know how a parent goes through that with a child.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I have an unexpected break from the kids this week. Long story short we were exposed to swine flu and just don&rsquo;t want to risk getting his daughter sick so we are waiting a few day to see if either of us gets sick. The break comes at a great time because this week I have 3 chapters to read and 3 assignments and 3 tests all while my midterm is due also! In fact I should be working on my midterm right now but I am sneaking a blog post instead.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">The husband&rsquo;s son who is 18 will officially be out of our house next week; I have mixed feelings about it. I hate to be that hard ass parent but he knew a year ago if he decided to not go to college his free ride ends. He is moving in with his grandma. I just hope he gets a job. I just don&rsquo;t understand this generation. When&nbsp;I was 16 I was chomping at the bit to get a job and car. Then moved out the week I graduated from highschool. Of course I also went to school full time for the first 3 years out of highschool.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I made a couple amazing things recently. I made a chili verde from Kates blog.(<a href=""http://superdaintykate.livejournal.com/"">http://superdaintykate.livejournal.com/</a>) &nbsp;It was SOOOOO EFFN yummy!!! I changed it a tiny bit because, well you know me I like to make it lighter, so I used chicken instead of pork. Next time I think I am going to make it in the crock pot because I don&rsquo;t think cooking it for a long time will hurt it at all. &nbsp;The husband put corn chips in his and I tore up a corn tortilla and put in it. I topped it with a bit of sour cream and some chopped green onion. <br />&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">The other thing I made was watermelon martinis!!! Sooooo freaking good. Unfortunately this was not a light recipe! I blended some watermelon in the food processor. Then strained it, added some simple syrup and vodka. Shook it with ice and put it in a sugar rimmed glass. It was soo pretty and gosh darn good. Unfortunately they go down very easy. Hehe</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I will not dwell on my whole weight watchers issues but I have to admit I haven&rsquo;t been very good about working out. So I am hoping to remedy that this week.</p>"

This all stemmed from the fact I didn&rsquo;t want to go in front of the whole company at our meeting a few months ago. The real reason is not that I can&rsquo;t do it but I feel a bit like I just don&rsquo;t get paid enough to do it. I know, I know that is very selfish of me to say however let&rsquo;s just put this in perspective. The VP and Directors are the only people that speak at the company meetings. I am not either, in fact I am sure all of the people that speak make at least 2 times my pay most 3 to 4. I am not saying it has only to do with pay but these are responsibilities that fall on senior management and I am not even management in this company. That is the core reason I asked not to be the substitute. I can do it with preparation but I will be nervous and I probably won&rsquo;t like it. You see my reasoning?</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I speak weekly to my new hires and at various meetings; I have done this for the last 15 years of my career. I can speak about things I am knowledgeable on and have not problem with groups of people. With this being stated, Toastmasters is a little piece of hell.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">My club is relatively new and I am lucky that it is with in my company so I do know all of the members.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">Here is how it works:</p><ul type=""disc"" style=""margin-top: 0in""><li style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">We have 3 presenters that have a speech those run about 5 minutes.</li><li style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">We have 3 evaluations of those speakers those run about 2 minutes.</li><li style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">Then we are off to table topics and that is where a speaker discusses a subject and asks questions of other members and they need to get up and speak about a minute on that topic.</li><li style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">All the while we have a Toastmaster who runs the meeting,</li><li style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">We&nbsp;have&nbsp;grammarian that tracks what everyone is saying and reports at the end any problems.</li><li style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">We have the AH counter this person must ring a bell each time anybody says Ah or um.</li><li style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">We have a few other duties that I won&rsquo;t go into.</li></ul><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">Personally I feel like this club is a bit out dated&hellip; the goal is to get people ok with speaking in public and to help them speak clearly with out cluttering their sentences with unnecessary words. Before you speak you must address the crowd and the toastmaster &ldquo;madam toastmaster, Fellow toastmasters&hellip;.&rdquo; You must shake the hand of the toast master before and after you speak. They hit a gavel to call the meeting to order and then again to adjourn the meeting.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I wonder if I will get a secret handshake to use when we aren&rsquo;t in the meeting to recognize a fellow toastmaster. I think we definitely need a hat we can wear in the meetings and we need a secret word to call out if we believe the meeting has been infiltrated by a non toastmaster. Maybe a passage to escape&hellip;.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">If you never hear from me again I may have been &ldquo;taken care of&rdquo; because I am not even sure I can talk about the club this openly&hellip;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">In all seriousness I feel dread before the meetings typically about 24 to 48 hours, I had a nightmare last week before the meeting. I had to speak and do my speech this week and I did great! The feed back I had was good and there were only a few things I needed to work on. Where I have problems is during that table topics part, I have a hard time talking to a group about something right off the top of my head. Weather or not is a subject I am knowledgeable about or not. I am unsure if this is a skill I am in need of having.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I believe I could reach the same goals by talking a class in college or something that requires me to speak or have me speak more to the company. I think I just can&rsquo;t get over the weird rules this club follows. &nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">I am a member for another 6 months&hellip;</p><br />* by asked i mean she put it in my&nbsp;Developement plan. She says I&nbsp;can't be a manager with out speaking to groups. The sad truth is I am aware there is no oppotunity for me to become a manager here due to the fact&nbsp;I can't relocate.&nbsp; It all seems to be a moot point."

I hope he decides to do this a couple days a week with me it was nice to be doing something with him that didn&rsquo;t involve his kids or fixing something on the house.

It really did make sense since I go to the admin meetings and book travel and stuff for the departments that don't have an admin. And it did make me realize my place in this company I am an admin and a hr coordinator. This year I didn't get anything.... no flowers not card nothing. I am not too upset about it but a tiny part of me is a little sad. Maybe there was no budget.<br /><br /><br />It reminds me of when I was about 8, I used to have a full size bed and my sister and brother both had twins in their rooms. I also typically had the most picked up room only because my brother is messy (still is) and my sister was younger than me. So any time my grand parents came to visit I was the one that gave up their room and I would sleep on my sister&rsquo;s trundle bed. &nbsp;That year when I go to go back to my room my grandparents had left a five dollar bill and a note saying thank you for letting us have your room.&nbsp;Well that amount of money is crazy to an 8 year old not to mention it was when my pop was laid off so I wasn&rsquo;t used to getting that much money just for myself for nothing!&nbsp;Needless to say it never happened again and each time I got my room back I half expected it, but felt awful that I wished it were there. i didn't want to be greedy. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt""><span style=""font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;gift horse&hellip;.mouth?&rdquo;</span></p>"

"event","She is a new dog!!!! she is happy and waggly and loves everyone. she is happier and more energetic than i have seen her since we got her last may. 
i am so happy the rough stuff is finally over. last thursday she had the tubes removed and the catheter taken out. she was almost immediately happier and seemed less uncomfortable. today we took her back and she had the 30 staples removed and the vet gave her a clean bill of health! she said she was very impressed at her healing and we were doing a great job. she also said the biopsy came back and the tumors were not cancer so we don't need to worry about more surgery!!
&nbsp;as we speak she is sleeping next to me and her feet are twitching because she must be dreaming about chasing the feral cat that lives in the back yard. hehehe

"event","so its official my hubby and i are a part of the PTA. my hubby is the VP i told him i wanted to print buttons up that said &quot;i am in the PTA&quot; and he could have one that said he was an officer or something like that!!!
i am really glad we are involved though because you see how little the school has to work with and what parents really need to do. i found out that the PTA funds the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that the kids with no money and no lunch get to have. sigh... it may take and hour every couple of weeks but what you can do for the school is a good thing. 
my stepdaughter goes to a great school but it is in the middle of town and the district it is in is by far the lowest funded. 
i have always know that teachers and schools need things but my mom and brother worked in a different district that had an area of much higher income.&nbsp; very interesting... i'll keep you posted"

"event","Well, we went back to the vet and they extended her meds and gave her a seditive for the evenings. last night was pretty bad. i am guessing that she was in so much pain she didn't know what to do so she paced the house for close to 12 hours. tonight i came home from work and laid on the floor and rubbed her ears and head till she fell asleep standing. then i coaxed her legs to go down. it took about an hour to calm her down.&nbsp; she is still sleeping in the same spot. i think i am going to be the couch sleeping person tonight, poor brian slept on the couch the last two nights. neither of us have slept very well. 
i did find time to color my hair, now i just need to get in for a hair cut. sigh."

"event","Trixie has surgery finally ! so now is all about recovery. 

here is what they did to my puppy.
She had to be spayed and according to the vet her ovaries were covered in cysts and that may have been causing her pain. then they took out 4 of her 8 mamorys because they had tumors. there is a small one on one of the 4 left but they couldn't remove that one because she had too much of her body open. we will decided in treatment after we find out if the tumors were cancer or not.
&nbsp;then they had to staple her closed and she has 2 drainage tubes in her abdomen.
&nbsp;after that they took out most of her teeth. she lost all on one side and a few on the other, they took both upper canines but left the lower. we are hoping those don't need to be taken. the vet said she probably needs them removed but she couldn't do it then because her jaw was so small and all of that trauma would probably have broken her jaw. there is a chance that now that all the bad tissue is gone and the healing will start that those two teeth will get stronger and she won't have to have them removed. i certainly hope so because i would like her to be able to keep her tongue in her mouth. 
so she has a catheter and we had to give her morphine yesterday every 4 hours, today she is on a different med that we give her two times. and she started her oral meds.
she hasn't gained any interest in water but she did eat food!! we gave her burger and white rice and she refused to eat the rice. So we blended the rice and burger and some water and she ate ALL of it!!!!

they put a pain med patch on her back... they stapled it on her!! the poor thing looks kinda bionic with so much tubes and metal in her skin. 

i'll try to get pics. 

so i am hoping that in a few weeks she'll be much better and in a few months she'll be a new dog! 

so the adoption won't be official until she is recovered."

WTF ???? i had already looked at my phone cuz i pre dialed 911 when i saw the guy and it was 5:27am...&nbsp; who in the hell smokes at 5am????

so i say ""i am up walking at 5am, i don't smoke asshole."" then i plugged in my earphone and kept walking. i heard some stuff but lucky for me he didn't follow.&nbsp;

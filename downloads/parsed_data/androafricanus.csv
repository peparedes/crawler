"event","There is such a thing as too much caffeine. I hit my limit today and ended up with a pounding headache in the afternoon. It's seemed to taper off now, and I'm relaxing to Miles/Evans while my Chinese mabo tofu warms on the front burner. I will try to moderate my caffeine intake in future to avoid the hangover.

I haven't been updating frequently because, to be honest, not much has changed in the past few weeks. I've been searching high and low for secondary part-time job opportunities that might further a potential academic career, and just when I find something promising the situation somehow goes awry. Ditto for my musical ambitions. Craigslist can only match you up with Blink 182 wannabes, death/shred metal weirdos, and other eccentrics. Le sigh . . .

On the plus side, Helena and I have been exploring Bay Area hiking trails, which usually lead to gorgeous views of the ocean or stately redwoods. A great diversion from the bustling (and occasionally stifling) atmosphere of the city. The few people we see hiking are generally outgoing and friendly. We Bay Area denizens should arrange a weekend camping trip this year. It would be so much fun, building a fire and enjoying the crisp forest aroma. I was surprised to learn that Helena has neither fished, rode a horse, or fired a gun. I'll have to make sure she accomplishes the first two."

He's been living in the US three years after marrying a Peace Corps volunteer who served in his country. We bonded over a crazy bum who yelled out at us, calling him a ""n****"" and myself a ""queer."" I mentioned to Matthews that she definitely chose the wrong city in which to, uhmm, dwell. We then chatted for the remainder of our respective breaks about US perceptions of Africa, SF, Sunset/Richmond districts, and travelling the US (he's visited more states than I have). Next time we get a chance to chat, I'm going to see if he has any leads on African specialty foods stores. 

In other news, I think I bombed my timed Google employment test. I was acing it up to the written section in which I spent too much time on the first two questions and then hit a mind block on the third one. In the end, I timed out with two questions to go. Here's hoping that the reviewer admires the quality of my completed responses and overlooks the fact that I didn't get to everything in the time allotted."

It seems like another world, so far from what's going on now. Didn't take long for me to readjust to the pace of American life. How frightening is that!

Last night, I made it to the Orange County Peace Corps Association happy hour at Alcapulco in Orange. I haven't spoken so much about my experience since I got back last month. People who weren't Peace Corps volunteers are interested in what I have to share only to some extent. That's understandable. I usually have to ask myself whether it's worth going through an extended spiel or just better to limit my comments to a general ""Yeah, Africa's nice."" My scrapbook should hopefully make Namibia and my travels a bit more vivid.

The car is backed into the driveway, and I'm slowly moving boxes from the garage to the trunk. I will be off to San Francisco for good on Monday. I don't yet have a job and only the vaguest notion of what I want to do next. The Peace Corps has taught me to be patient. I have some idea  of the way forward and I'm eager to get on with my career.

"event","In Maputo for one last night of Mozambique. The capital has a Latin-European vibe and is somewhat well-planned. Mozambique is absolutely gorgeous! I spent two years in desert nothingness (still love ya, Nam!), while volunteers here are within striking distance of fabulous beaches and can get cheap bananas, mangos, cashews, avocados (!), and other green-like things on the side of the road for nearly nothing. The people are incredibly nice and welcoming like pretty much everywhere in southern Africa (except, you know, Johannesburg). They also don't speak a lick of English outside Maputo which means that I've picked up some Portuguese (enough to bargain for y'all's Christmas gifts).

I leave this side of the world on Thursday and am already apprehensive about the transition back to American life. It would help if I had a clue about what I want to do next. I'll have to do some serious deep-thinking, which I perhaps will make public here. Look forward to being back in California soon and sharing my experiences firsthand. Tomorrow morning early, I catch a bus for Joburg, where I'll hunker down for a day before my long flight home on Thursday.

Things are just so damn expensive here! I'm staying at about the cheapest place I can find (I can tell it's suitably down-market by the prostitution business that I suspect is being carried on down the hall). None of the banks recognize MasterCard. Thank God that after years of being VISA my new Washington Mutual debit is now MasterCard!!! So, I can't get pula and will have to exchange the few rand notes I brought to tide me over until I leave tomorrow. 

Fortunately, I just booked the last Intercape seat to Johannesburg with my VISA credit card (which doesn't have a PIN, alas). From there, I'll arrange local transport to Maputo and hopefully get enough meticais (MZM) to cover the cross-border VISA. Can't wait to get to Mozambique!!!"

I'm already letting go of all the frustrating times and embracing only the happy memories.

Tomorrow morning early, I'll be on my way to Windhoek. I'll spend a week there taking care of PC administrative junk and figuring out where I'm going next and how I plan to get there.

Yeah, I'm pretty bored. I just took a Ministry of Labour survey. It was hard to fill out. Questions like ""profession"" are much easier to answer when you've majored in something like aerospace engineering. The examiner didn't quite grasp the concept of having a degree in something that won't lead you directly into a given profession. I eventually just put down ""teacher."""

"event","For some reason, my school is in some sort of blackhole whereby we receive information later than everybody else. Hence, we are in limbo between the end of substantive teaching and the exams that may or may not begin this week. We have to wait until the principals' meeting tomorrow to find out what the exam schedule actually looks like. Personally, I have no interest whatsoever in trying to teach during the next few days, and the kids have no interest in listening to me. They're in exam mode: cram and regurgitate. And I fear that exams won't start until next week which will mean that I'll have to mark an ungodly amount of work in an insanely short amount of time. The Namibian education system counters, ""Hey, you should mark on your own free time, Mr. or Mrs. Teacher who's being paid jack and who can look forward to reading semi-comprehensible nonsense all night!""

I have found a much more important use of my time than marking: writing rap lyrics in Oshiwambo! I wowed the learners this morning with some of my mad rhymes:

<i>Eeno, hangame kamatyona
Ihe omulumentu gwoshiponga.
Kesh'uumati wa pumbwa okwiilonga
Kombinga yOutapi kOndonga.<br>

"event","It's hard to maintain this journal. I usually have the most need to post after the school day's over or on the weekends. Things are too hectic and stressful during school for me to give a considered account of what's going on. I had a long-winded narrative worked up in my head last night, but only bits and pieces are left over. Here's the gist of it:

Pouring myself a second helping of traditional sorghum beer, I reflect on the likelihood that I would ever get the opportunity to do something like this again. It's had its ups and downs, but Sundays on the homestead I cherish. I generally join the family for a dinner of pearl millet porridge and whatever's available to constitute the soup: fish, goat, beef, chicken (on special occasions), mopane worms or perhaps <i>omboga</i> (wild spinach). Last night, I felt particularly content. I had finished my marking for the day, my lessons were in some semblance of order for the coming week, and regardless of whatever frustrations and complications arise during the week I'll be off to Windhoek on Sunday for my end-of-service medical exam. This is to be my last week of active teaching in Namibia. I should enjoy it. 

After supper on Sundays, we come together as a family to sing a hymn in Oshiwambo. There are two or three songs that Mr. Bradley is quite familiar with. So, we sing ""<i>Kundwa Kundwa Santa Maria</i>,"" a particularly Catholic selection that underscores our shared heritage. Often, I bring my mandolin to these sessions and play along with the children. Just another one of those Peace Corps moments, the ones advertised in the brochures and in magazine features that happen . . . well, fairly often actually. We conclude our song and end the night in a prayer. ""<i>Kalale po nawa, teekulu</i>,"" I say as I leave for bed. ""<i>Kalale po nawa, kuku</i>."" ""<i>Eewa, Mister Andrew</i>,"" Tatekulu answers. ""<i>Kalale po nawa, kuume</i>."" 

Retiring for the night, I consider my time spent in Namibia. Was it worth it? On balance, yes. As an agent of development, I have been a failure. I have not contributed anything of substance to the school's or to the community's development. I taught, rather haphazardly, and spent more time adapting to Namibia's ad-hoc way of doing things than importing my own American know-how. Perhaps, I lack the personality or work ethic required to see through real sustainable development. Whatever. I'm over that. 

But, that's not what has kept me here, living without the amenities and the support I had come to take for granted before. The other night, I was grilling ham, cheese and onion toasties (that's Britspeak for grilled cheese) for the <i>aanona</i> and giving the girls an impromptu grammar lesson when Sylvia remarked, ""But, this year . . . I don't want you to go."" My Bush bravado intact, I had to exhibit my American resolute strength bullshit. Well, in truth, I just pretended not to hear her. But, I was having the same thoughts. There are many things I won't miss, like those damn thorns that find their way into my bedroom and have me cursing in the mornings or the constant begging from Owambo children for sweets and dollars and whatnot (They're now asking for N$5 these days. Must be inflation!). I'm not going to miss teaching. The learners? Perhaps . . . some of them. It will be most difficult to leave my host family and close friends and colleagues behind. I hope they somehow find the wherewithal to come visit me, but that's pretty unlikely for most of them. I'll never forget them as I hope they never forget me."

Well, the educational tour was an unqualified success. I managed to arrange private transport the day before we left. We were negotiating up until late afternoon Thursday, and I prayed fervently that the drivers would show up early the next day to take us to Etosha. Fortunately, they did. From that point on, everything went fairly smoothly, save for our drivers' tendency to drink too much and get friendly with the girls. Good thing I had my colleagues Mr. Iipumbu and Mr. Pokolo there to run interference and keep the guys in line.

We saw such a variety of wildlife: a pride of lions guarding a waterhole, scores of giraffes, several elephants, zebras, <a href = ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springbok_Antelope"">springbok</a>, blue wildebeasts, <a href = ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemsbok"">gemsbok</a>, <a href = ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Kudu"">kudu</a> and much more. We also had the opportunity to visit a snake ranch, which freaked the hell out of the kids (Owambos are afraid of most insects, owls and anything reptilian . . . snakes most of all). They had some nature videos back at the Environmental Education Centre to watch during the evenings, and the cooking went pretty well (though Owambo children can be pretty damn picky in their own way). There was also a brief tour of Namutoni Fort, which was used as a German outpost in the north during the colonial period. I'm going to have the pictures developed today.

This month has been hectic, and October promises to be even more crazy. Grade 10 exams begin either next week or the week after (I forget). And time's running out for writing assignments, math projects and any other homework I need to give out. In addition, I have some paperwork to complete for the Peace Corps so that I can leave Namibia in December. One shipment of books has arrived from the Tustin Rotary, and we've been busy the past few days stamping, categorizing and shelving them. Many more are on the way. I'll try to be diligent about thank-you letters and pictures.

I guess I should pack up my stuff and get out of here. I hate being the last one to leave and then having to be responsible for locking up and keeping the keys all weekend. Plus, I need a ride to town. Ciao!"

"event","Just when I had given way to the worst pessimism, to the blackest void of human sentiment, my educational tour to Etosha managed to get approved by the regional director with transport and all. True, it will be by the skin of our teeth, and I will have to scramble around this weekend to secure super-expensive private transport in the almost certain event that the Ministry vehicle does not avail itself. We have only a week to get our shite together and collect funds from the learners. Fortunately, the three-day tour costs a paltry N$100 per learner . . . which is roughly one-third of what one of my fellow teachers spent on booze and meat on one of the Saturdays on which he got paid.

In other news, last night I killed a mouse in my house. There's a lot of junk hanging around to scrounge in, and he (or she?) no doubt found himself (herself?) in paradise. But, the mouse got too haughty. It proceeded to delve into a trash bag about ten feet from my bed, where I was lying with my school preparation materials. I dispatched the poor bastard with a well-aimed toss of a textbook. Immediately, the sadness ensued. I wasn't sad when we slaughtered my goat Miles (named posthumously). [By the way, did you know that I owned a goat? For a good hour and a half, I was the proud owner of a male goat. I could've spared his life and took him home as a pet. But, man, he tasted good! How many of you city slickers out there have ever owned a goat?]

Discipline is getting better in my classes, and I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of the teaching aspect of my job. I have the classes competing against each other on a points system. I can reward points when the kids are on task and take them away whenever they get a bit too rowdy. The graded results will be underwhelming, sure, but at least I've got my house in order."

Actually, Aaron's picking up a friend from the airport on Monday and skipping out on the bureaucratic funfest that is a Peace Corps conference. I'll be spending the next few days working on my plans for the last term of my teaching stint. Many ideas that have accumulated that need to be fleshed out. Basically, since I'm a lame duck, I plan on having as much fun as possible with my classes while appearing to cover the material.

Windhoek's an interesting place. People from throughout the country flock to its (relatively) bustling capital. You can hear every language from Namibia and a handfull of European tongues as well. Most strangers assume I speak Afrikaans until I respond, ""<i>Ek praat nie Afrikaans. Ek is Amerikaner</i>."" Yesterday, I went shopping for the first time in . . . years. Bought a couple of shirts, as I have been camping out for the last two weeks and have absolutely nothing to wear. Coming from the bush, it's hard to deal with all the fashionable denizens of the city. Everyone's all put together, clean and whatnot. Back in the village, I mostly dress like a bum . . . or an Afrikaner.

Crap, the time's running out. OK, I'll try to post later on."

"event","For the last few weeks, I've been marking ream after ream of exams in preparation for this day. The end of every term becomes an administrative nightmare. Namibian schools are decidedly paper-based, and there's no avoiding the tedium of repetitive tasks. Word in the staffroom is that the school failed pathetically, immeasurably...the whole school. At some point yesterday, I almost began to cry and call for my mother and an ice cream cone. I'm still trying to cope with the fact that I will have spent two years in Namibia only to watch a school decline farther and farther, results-wise that is. A huge dent in my ever-fragile ego.

Ahh, but I won't dwell on that too much. In a matter of hours, I'll be on holiday. I'll leave Owamboland pretending that it's children can actually deal with instruction in a language they don't understand. I'm off to do what I came here to do: to experience different cultures, speak a local language and spread some American-style goodwill. It would've helped if I had a job I didn't detest. Hopefully, I'll return with some strategy for making my last term as a Namibian teacher worthwhile.

My buddy Aaron and I are headed southwest to Opuwo, which means ""the end"" or ""enough"" in Otjiherero. Typically the last stop on the way to the Atlantic, this desultory town will instead be the starting point of our adventure tour of the Namibian west. We'll hopefully catch a ride on the dirt road to Epupa Falls, where we'll camp out for a few days before returning to Opuwo. From there, we'll head south through Damaraland with no definitive plans. Our only requirement is that we rendezvous with the rest of our group in Windhoek for our COS (completion of service) conference at the beginning of September. So, as from now, I will be out-of-touch. Ciao!"

We've now got a system in place that allows the learners to use rather than lose the books. This will be the last opportunity to help develop Ntuli Junior Secondary School for you folks stateside. If you can get together a collection of books, you can send them here via the Postal Service's M-Bag service ($1 per lb. or something in that range). It doesn't matter what level the books are at. Our reading skills range from super-basic to Harry Potter. 

So, if you or any organisation you're involved with would like to get together some books to help my school out, you can ship them to:
<center>P.O. Box 6862<br>Windhoek, Namibia 9000</center>

You should get these materials together soon, as the time I COS (complete my service, in PC jargon) is drawing nigh and the books take a while to get here on the slow boat. We have an especial need for reference materials such as dictionaries, thesauruses and atlases. Anything else you can manage (including games!) would be awesome.

<i>Tangi! Onda pandula unene!!!</i>

UPDATE: Please make sure to attach my name and school, Ntuli Junior Secondary School, to your shipment so that Peace Corps knows where the books should go. According to my mother, the Postal Service M-Bag is $1.05 per lb. for up to 66 lbs. Once again, thanks!"

Today was one of those rare good days of teaching. In maths, I had the kids review multiplying big numbers. They had worksheets to complete in ten minutes, and I used my flashcards from home to get them started. Discipline is getting better since I introduced Mr. Bradley's Behaviour Book and brought back the stickers, though I still have trouble getting them to do and submit homework. For English, we continued a debate on town vs. village life. The learners really took to the topic and actually prepared some interesting points. At the end of 9B's period, I had extra time. So, I jumped into the debate and let the class try to win points off me. They really got energized and came up with some really good arguments. If only they were this motivated the rest of the year . . . 

<u>Best thing in the world</u>: taking a run in the late afternoon and following it up with a bucket bath as the sun sets over the wide savannahs. The cool water relaxes my muscles, and I feel as though I've actually accomplished something.

The past few days have been unusually stress-free. I've learned to take things in stride and not get too worked up re: the school situation. I've been holding a computer class for a few learners who will be computer prefects next year. It feels good to focus my attention on a few who are generally interested in the subject and are willing to follow my instructions rather than try to impose my rule on the aimless masses. The classes are also for the teachers, but staff attendence has been rather spotty. Oh well . . ."

I think I'm gonna sign off early here at school to get a head start on some housekeeping I need to do back at the homestead.

Last week, I found myself wearing a variety of different hats in addition to the one of a teacher. Parent's Day was on Thursday afternoon. The school invites the parents to come and inspect the books of the learners to make sure they're doing something at these piss-poor government institutions. Since most parents don't know English, they merely look for red marks indicative of positive teacher feedback. As fans of my blog will know, I hate marking. My books are in utter disarray, while the other teachers have spotless manuals full of assignments ready to present. That doesn't mean that they actually teach anything, just that they give the learners ample stuff to copy.

Actually, Parent's Day turned out pretty well. I didn't have to teach for a few periods and I was able to talk to the parents about their children's progress. I was amazed at how competent I was in Oshiwambo. Some assured me that they would thoroughly beat their kids. <I>Eewa</I>. Rather, I was hoping that they would provide some words of encouragement and maybe make their learners listen to English-only radio stations. I had to sign Sylvia's books. I already know that she's a fairly good student but I was curious to see what subjects she was struggling with (History and Geography) and how the other teachers get the material across (mostly inane summaries). Unlike the majority of the other parents, I can read and understand what's going on in my ""child's"" classes. It's good to feel useful on the homestead every once in a while.

Yesterday, I was approached to draft a letter on behalf of the village to the governor of the Oshana Region requesting assistance in negotiations with Nored, a private electrical supplier here in Namibia. According to some of the village functionaries, the company is not meeting its contractual obligations after payment has been made. I felt like a VIP what with my knowledge of English and my excellent writing/reasoning skills. Yet, I absolutely refuse to go to law school. Absolutely."

The unfortunate thing is that I fully expected it. Due to whatever circumstances (I'm sick of fleshing them out), I can't make the test easy enough. You can constantly drill in the learners the need to study and take good notes, but those just aren't skill sets they've acquired yet. The sub-standard level of education in the north has made the learners idiots basically, capable only of memorizing and regurgitating.

But, as the subject line says, it <i>is</i> Friday. That means that no matter how horrible the second half of the day goes I can look forward to a coke at the village cuca shop after school to ease the pain. I've actually planned a pretty fun English lesson for the learners, complete with candy rewards for the group that scores highest on my informal vocabulary quiz. This week was HIV/AIDS week in the Namibian education sector, so I planned my lessons according to that theme. It worked well the first few days, but then discipline started to erode yesterday as it tends to do towards the end of the week. Some male learners in 9C are outside engaging in hard labor as punishment for their transgressions in my class yesterday.

Tomorrow, I'm off to Aaron's homestead for some down time. Our mutual friend, Kauluma, is visiting Onamutai from Cape Town, where he's studying for an advanced degree or something. I need to buy some comfy sweats in town to wear when I get home from school. It's friggin' cold in the evenings! Next week, we get a four-day weekend for no particular reason other than the Ministry wants to keep a regular number of school days each year. The elation hasn't hit me quite yet. Too many things left to mark (currently, the bane of my existence)."

I'm just sick of using Namibian examples for everything. Namibia's lovely and all, but I couldn't come up with 8 different cities or towns here that would merit six-page brochures. As always, the results have been subpar (what's par, though?). I'm just glad that the kids seem to enjoy using the computers to do their own research to supplement the handouts I printed up for them. That's an accomplishment...I think. There are eight groups in each class to which I assigned the following 8 cities: Anaheim, LA, Long Beach, SF, San Diego, Oakland, San Jose and Sacramento. Better to have 24 (8 x the 3 classes of English I have) crappy projects to mark than 96-odd individual POS efforts. The only problem is that the whole thing is making me homesick.

The preparations for my educational tour are rolling along at a constant, albeit slow, rate. We've booked September 22-24 at the Namutoni Environmental Education Centre in Etosha. The Committee has made quotations for food and promulgated the dates and other information to the parents and learners. Just waiting to hear back from the Ministry on our request for transportation and permission to take Friday, the 22nd, off from school.

"event","Everything about Fish River Canyon seemed to work itself out. Getting to the start of the hike was half of the adventure. We ended up hiring a really nice taxi driver from Keetmans named Otto to drive us all the way out into the middle of nowhere (Hobas). The problem with Namibia's nascent tourism industry is that you really have to be rolling in dough to experience certain parts of this beautiful country. That's why most tourists are getting around in massive rented Land Rovers or Jeeps. For us of the more frugal persuasion, you have to rely on your own resourcefulness (*snicker*) or be willing to put in some extra time.

But, as usual, everything seems to work out...which is, not to make too fine a point of it, somewhat the ""African way."" The hike itself was rather strenuous, much more than I expected. On the last day, we had to float a thermarest to get our packs across a nearly unnavigable river while swimming alongside. We shared the trail with a group of British military personnel on ""adventure training."" I suspect that they were trying to beat us on the last day. Whatever. The first two days were the hardest, culminating with a night at a spot with natural hot springs to rejuvenate our aching bodies. After that, it was necessary to cross the river about twenty times. We got pretty good at picking nice walking sticks to steady ourselves as we waded waist-deep through the smaller rapids. My stick was named Miles.

Wednesday, we arrived at Ai-Ais after the 4.5-day, 85 km trek to camp at a really fancy resort with unnatural hot springs. The victory beers went down like water, and we soaked for a good hour or so. One of the best aspects of our excursion were the campfires. You can camp anywhere along the trail and build fires with any wood you find. We slept out under the stars around the fire like cowboys. Real male bonding.

Anyways, people are itching to use the Internet, so I'll end the thread here and pick it up with a second post. Cheers!"

Aaron and I arrived from Cape Town yesterday morning (3 AM) and, later, saw pretty much everything there is to see (a free museum) in an hour or so. We've been busy trying to arrange a ride to Hobas at the start of the Fish River Canyon hike with some success. We've received conflicting information regarding the conditions along the trail but are satisfied that it'll be perfectly awesome. The heavy rains of the past few months mean that water will be plentiful and the vegetation will be in as fullest splendor as can be for a canyon. I'm stoked. Brian and Jon are coming down slowly in a big rig from Windhoek. 

Last night was one for the record books. Aaron and I decided to venture out for a beer or two. We emptied our wallets of all valuables, save for a little cash to pay for the drinks, and headed a block down. We ended up going to this bomb shelter-looking joint with odd music emanating from it that turned out to be the most Afrikaner Afrikaner bar I've ever experienced. We were so totally out-of-place amid the jubilant and somewhat rotound denizens that we must have stood out like a sore thumb. Amid the strains of Afrikaner muzak (kind of country and polka with hint of Top 40s), we nursed our Hansas and tried hard not to smile or laugh.

Two blokes got behind the bar and started to bust out some tunes on their guitars. After their one-song set, the more loquacious of the two sidled up to Aaron and struck up a conversation. The next thing I knew it, Aaron had volunteered me to play. I made him join in, and after some minutes we struggled to get something going. We were jeered and almost ordered to buy a round for our transgressions. Then, Aaron yanked himself from the lineup and was replaced by the better guitarist of the Afrikaner duo. We managed our way through a rather creditable blues romp and everyone was duly impressed, particularly since we set the bar so low on our first try.

So, we had to stay for a couple more sets in which I was roped in to playing versions of ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" and ""Hey Joe."" Aaron and I were minor celebrities for the evening and were treated to quite a few drinks. We were so rockstar that, when a Brian Seltzer song popped up, we swept up two butch-looking Afrikaner ladies and taught them how to swing dance...poorly. I'm hoping last night's good fortune carries over to the hike. I bought a disposable camera just for the 5-day journey."

"event","School is rather hectic at the moment. According to the Ministry, we are expected to continue teaching through the exams. This seems fine in theory, but an exercise in futility in practice. The learners couldn't care less. They know I have no intention of giving more work. Both of my exams have already been given, so the learners have no other incentive to listen, behave or participate besides their natural love of learning*. Moreover, someone forgot to pay the water bill, and thus the learners are even more bored and tired than usual. 

Nevertheless, I press on. It kind of disturbs me that after a whole term the kids still multiply the exponent and the base when raising numbers to a power. If I can't even get that concept across, how can I even have any hope of getting them through the rest of the syllabus in the next two terms? Namibian learners have a remarkable talent for making the same mathematical mistakes over and over again. I've been having trouble motivating myself to teach this term because it often seems like my students have little or no foundation upon which to build. Considering the prodigious piles of bitchwork teaching in Namibia entails, I have become rather apathetic. The other day, I asked (apparently rhetorically) for the learners to give me some adjectives to use in a Mad Libs-type exercise that I thought would be fun. They, of course, began blurting out whatever words came into their obviously-confused little heads.

In the north, the problem (as near as I can tell) is that people just can't cope with English as the medium of instruction. Teachers struggle to explain, give up and then rely on summaries to get the info out there (though not necessarily understood). Learners sit through weeks of what must be a phantasmagoric acid trip of incomprehensible symbols and phrases before having to regurgitate ""their best understanding"" under test conditions. And for those not used to consistent failure like myself, it is a system that breeds cynicism.

One thing's for sure: I won't spend one more second more than I have to teaching here.

[Answer: His horse is named Friday. - <i>Not a great one, since I'm going off the top of my head.</i>] I'm trying to compile a list of such puzzles for the learners. They're fun to throw out during a Friday math class for some critical thinking practice. And they definitely need help with word problems. If you remember any or find a website with them, please let me know in my comments section."

"event","<i>Omagongo</i> is a juice made from the fruit of the <a href = ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marula"">Marula</a> tree. Rather bitter, it packs a punch when allowed to ferment for a short period of time. While <i>otombo</i>, made from brown sugar and ginger, is a locally-brewed alcoholic beverage looked down upon in my area, <i>omagongo</i> is perfectly acceptable because it's ""traditional."" If you ask me, <i>omagongo</i> juice is more powerful. Yet, I suppose, it's natural, whereas <i>otombo</i> is often illegally spiked with old shoes and battery acid to give it extra kick.

Every day, I find folks enjoying <i>omagongo</i> when I come home from school. They are always happy to greet me since they are, well, wasted. I partake in a cup or two but am wary of the magic number four. At four, you find yourself somewhat inebriated with a lingering bitch of a headache, a real downer if you have to teach the following morning. Unfortunately, my bathing area is the one closest to the big tree they drink under. And since the Owambos like to urinate down the drain they also use for bathing, I find myself hit by a big-ass ammonia bomb when I go to bucket bathe in the afternoon."

"event","It has been raining torrentially, nay apocalyptically, throughout the country. Over the past few weeks, I've had to take off my pants to get to school several times. The first week, I was pissed off. Now, I'm getting used to taking my shoes off to ford the little rivers that come between my school and the homestead. Just have to make sure to keep my feet clean and pop a multivitamin daily.

Teaching English to almost one hundred learners a day is proving to be a logistical nightmare. As soon as I'm finished marking on assignment, another one has to be collected and marked forthwith. Getting the kids to understand that there even <i>is</i> an assigment to be written (let alone what I expect them to do) is a chore. I teach four hours each day and then do my best during Study to answer learners' questions, supervise clubs and keep the library open. Nevertheless, it all just amounts to almost constant feelings of guilt. In maths, at least, the learners can mark their own homework. English, though, is just bitchwork that makes me a hateful person to be around. Nobody (including myself) is qualified to teach English, as it is set out in the national syllabus. I wish I could pass it off altogether.

<b>Important!</b> Don't send mail or packages to the P.O. Box 922 address anymore. The family forgot to renew the box, so I will rely on the school's address for the time being [P.O. Box 3453, Ongwediva]. I may try to share a mailbox with another volunteer. We'll see. For now, I'm trying to get ahold of the mail that I've missed since the beginning of the year. Please <i>do</i> send me foodstuffs and books and nice things like that (to the Ongwediva address). I definitely need the cheering up."

"event","We had an announcement today that there would be some activities on ""Volunteer's Day."" Oh, that's <i>Valentine's Day</i>. What's most amazing is that I had nothing whatsoever to do with planning this event. So, of course, I plan to take full credit for it. Apparently, there's a group of ambitious young ladies from town who thought that a ""disco"" and other festivities would be a fun way to raise money for our school's development. Learners will have the option of wearing free dress next Tuesday, provided that they pay a fee of fifty cents. After school, we will then have a Valentine's Day ""disco,"" which will include a DJ (!) and refreshments. Admission for that is N$5. Just when I had written off secondary projects at Ntuli...

I'm all for these fun extracurricular activities because, let's face it, school in Namibia is boring as all hell. With all the pressure of national exams that determine your economic fate FOREVER (cue echo), classes take on a weight that actually inhibits learners from, well, learning. By the end of each term, the school is basically in cramming mode, foregoing learner participation for vigorous test prep. And, as always, rote memorization is the norm in content-based subjects. That's why I'm sponsoring an ""educational tour"" in August to Etosha: to get the kids out of those damn stuffy classrooms."

"event","Well, glad to know all the pledges the teachers of Ntuli made this year to bring about change at the school were just words. Currently, there are only two of us here to supervise Study Time (Namibian study hall). That's two teachers to 270+ learners. Oh, and club activities are being minimized this year for more concentrated Study Time because the reason the kids failed is because they didn't spend enough time staring at a few textbooks scattered around the class couched in a language they barely understand. Study Time is my favorite. Because northern Namibians are too rural, uneducated and poor to study at home (as the thinking apparently goes), we the teachers must force the kids to study on behalf of their illiterate or absent parents. But, with two against 270+, not much studying is going on. They should rechristen it Loud Noise, Fighting and Theft Time because that's really what it's all about.

My school failed miserably, pathetically. Rather than work the numbers and decide what really is driving our underperformance (I have some theories, obviously), the Region has told us teachers to monitor each other's work more. I'm supposed to turn in lesson plans daily. Let's see them enforce that! It just seems to me that Namibians, or at least Ministry officials, have a different approach to management than I do. Whenever something doesn't go right, I try to reduce, to get a handle on the situation by removing extraneous stuff and fixing my core problems before going on to bigger projects. Here, though, it seems that the favorite response to failure is to heap new burdens on everyone and make everyone read some new public-service charter in the hope that we all magically get our shit together. Alright, gotta get back to answer homework-related questions and bust some heads."

"event","I'm back in the saddle again...except it's not a saddle, it's at the helm of my <i>very own</i> classroom full of wide-eyed Namibian kids. Note the emphasis on ""very own."" This classroom is MINE. All the desks are already grouped, neat, with plenty of space for me to perform and swoop down on unsuspecting deviants. I can decorate my room however I please. The grammar and basic math charts I brought from the States, HIV/AIDS posters, bits of motivational blather. Most importantly, it will remain clean and orderly. I will no longer walk into what looks like a bombing, with books, papers, desks and chairs scattered every which way. I have my own teacher's desk and a homework box. Power, I tell you. I possess nothing less than absolute power. Nothing can escape my power! Muahahahaha *maniacal laugh*!!! Uhmmm, yeah, so there.


We'll see how long this lasts. My domestic life is turning out nicely as well. I think I've finally got my living quarters sorted out in such a way that I wouldn't be embarrassed to invite strangers over for dinner. Provided that they like variations on a one-pot meal. Since <a href = ""http://www.livejournal.com/~ceruleanpoet"">certain</a> <a href = ""http://www.livejournal.com/~mattyhsu"">people</a> living in Japan like to write often about food, I will do likewise: Bread...I like bread but I can't seem to get enough of it. You see, if the contents of your cupboard are limited by how much you can carry for a kilometer in the heat, you find yourself living pretty meagerly. Two loaves of bread are just too much with the other bulk I must heave, but one loaf for a week results in severe rationing. I want that cheese sandwich (yeah, meat doesn't make the cut, either) but I only have enough bread for breakfasts. What a dilemma! I suppose I could bake my own bread like other volunteers do. However, baking is for wusses. Next post: recipes for the extremely cheap, I mean frugal, volunteer."

"event","Back in Namibia. Too bad my luggage didn't make it as well. My flight from Atlanta arrived in Johannesburg less than an hour before my next flight, and I instantly realized there was about an 80% chance my two pieces would be left behind. Nevertheless, I had a pretty good trip back. I've never slept so long on a plane before. Although my stomach acted up a bit, I was able to keep it under control for the duration. Hopefully, Air Namibia or British Airways delivers my bags tomorrow so that I can get up north forthwith. I want to get settled back in ASAP.

I had a wonderful time back home. It was interesting to take a look at home from a different perspective. So many people, so many cars, so much stuff. Before I left, I read an article in the California section of The LA Times about dumping of LA waste in Kern County. I'm reading Professor Diamond's <a href = ""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670033375/qid=1136384125/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-4923384-0904110?n=507846&s=books&v=glance"">latest book</a>, so I'm turning a lot of those issues over in my mind as I contemplate my circumstances. 

For those I got to see in my brief visit, I want to thank you for showing me a great time! For those I didn't, uhmm, have a nice life...I mean, I'll see you at the end of this year. My mind has been drained by the flight, so stay tuned for more pithy comments at a later date."

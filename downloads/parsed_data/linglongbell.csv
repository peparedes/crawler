Since I've been given a fair chance, I should fight for it. (With Zoo's help, thanks, and I'm guessing Scott probably would have found out from my failed mails to him. OH, fuck.)

Anyways, worked with Fidah last sat and then, we kinda talked about how not everyone is meant to be together with someone. Maybe missed opportunity, maybe. Its true, some people die alone man. How scary is that. I mean, I don't see myself married and I cannot see a guy kneeling on one knee proposing (maybe he'll be kneeling on both. HAHA, ok, sorry, bad joke, bad timing.). OMG. I am going to be one pissy old woman who will be deprived of sex but according to Michelle, HEY! D.I.Y.! :D HAHA. Fidah just fear turning lesbian. (Y) hahahaha. 

Better stop. Later Wendy say I emo. Hahah, GET WELL SOON LA WENLI!

Customer: I recently survived an accident and it was quite bad. I was under a truck and I had to crawl out of it.
Boss: Oh, but you are not scratched at all.
Customer: Because I am a Terminator.

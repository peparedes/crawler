"event","Stacey and I arrive at our apartment some time around 1am in our normal slightly drunk, lazy fashion. As soon as we walk in the front door, we notice that every single article that belongs in the bathroom has been dumped into the middle of the living room (down to the toilet plunger and shower caddy). 
 
 &quot;Oh God, Dessa is home.&quot;
 
 Stacey and I shrug it off, deciding to sit down and watch some TV in the living room, floor completely littered with haphazard bathroom items. Around 2 minutes later, the lovely Dessa emerges from her room. Attempting to avoid any chance of conflict, I pretend that I don't notice her presence. She's done some pretty insane shit in the past, and I am not particularly looking for another night of crazy.
 
 Unfortunately, THIS NIGHT IS SPECIAL: 
 
 Dessa immediately begins screaming (out of fucking nowhere) telling Stacey and I that &quot;we must leave the apartment immediately&quot;. She justifies this by telling us that we are &quot;the children of Satan&quot; and are tainted and evil beings. Fucked up. Stacey and I react with a resounding &quot;W H A T THE FUUUCCK????&quot; Dessa then informs us that our apartment is &quot;a house of god, and we must LEAVE IMMEDIATELY or we will be rebuked in the name of the lord Jesus.&quot; Stacey and I are shocked and appalled, and a bit of awkward laughter crops up. I mean, we knew Dessa was crazy, but COME THE FUCK ON. Dessa begins trailing me around the apartment, gesticulating and ranting about how I am the spawn of Satan.
 
 I do my best to avoid her, which is somewhat difficult seeing as she's inches from my face screaming about the power of Jesus, and how I will be smitten by our lord and savior. I say something along the lines of ''That's great, Dessa&quot; (somewhat worried by now) and begin to tentatively place the bathroom items back in the bathroom. As soon as I begin to walk past Dessa with the toilet plunger, she makes a sudden and wild grab for it, declaring: ''THIS FILTH MAY NOT PASS THE THRESHOLD&quot;.
 .....WHAT???? threshold??????iWhat the fuck is going on? Dessa gets a wild look in her eye and accosts me for the plunger. She then begins waving it wildly, slinging toilet water around the living room and yelling some crazy shit about Jesus and filth and who the fuck else knows what else. Stacey has some bed sheets in the living room, which Dessa attacks with the plunger, chanting some more wild shit about Jesus. Dessa then scampers outside with the plunger whilst yelling about its evil qualities. By this time, I'm laughing my ass off because THIS shit is FUCKED UP. I make an attempt to place a trash can back in the bathroom. As soon as I touch the bathroom door knob I notice that there is some WEIRD FUCKING SUBSTANCE on it.
 
 Dessa (who has apparently returned from her wild outdoor adventure) exclaims: ''what did you just touch?&quot;
 
 I dont say anything.
 
 I have no idea what I just put my hand in; it feels cold, and I'm getting somewhat weirded out and annoyed (the funny had begun to wear off by this point). Dessa then informs me that I am &quot;going to be gone soon&quot;, which (needless to say) is a really fucking weird thing to tell someone. I'm thinking to myself &quot;I hope she didn't fucking Ricin the door handle&quot;. I keep my cool and kind of laugh it off, washing my tainted hand thoroughly. At this point, I start up on an energy drink whilst Dessa follows Stacey and I around the apartment, repeating her &quot;evil spawn of satan'' schtick.
 
 I'm fed up and decide to turn the TV on, thinking Dessa will get bored, go away, shut up, all of the above. As soon as the thing goes on, she turns it off and screeches at me. I shrug and turn it back on, as I'm the one with the remote. She rips the cord out of the wall. I grab my kodak and begin filming her insanity. This shit has gone WAYY TOO FAR. As soon as she notices that I am recording her, her fucked up personality suddenly 180s and she begins making a strange attempt to act normal. This is possibly even weirder than her regular psychotic nature. Everything that she had said earlier she refutes, and at some point she begins asking why Stacey and I had thrown stuff around the apartment. I decide to reattach the TV cord. I move the TV away from the wall, which prompts Dessa to stand creepishly close to me. She begins telling me that ''I shouldn't mess around behind the TV, that's the landlord's property etc&quot;. I laugh nervously and ask her if she remembers pulling the cord out of the wall. She rants some more. I finally manage to fix the TV. Dessa disappears into the back of the apartment, rustling around in her room for about 5 minutes. When she re-emerges.........SHE'S HOLDING A FUCKING TAMBOURINE WITH A FUCKING JESUS CROSS ON THE FRONT OF IT. At this point, I'm like ''oh my god, someone call the fucking loony bin.&quot; She stands in front of the TV in a position that makes her look like some kind of a fucked up holocaust victim. I begin photographing the moment, laughing nervously and asking Dessa why we aren't allowed to watch TV. She doesn't respond in any logical way. Stacey is now on the phone with her cousin (who's a cop) asking what the fuck to do. Dessa begins rebuking us again, and I turn the TV back on. I stop recording for a bit. Dessa rips the cord out of the wall for the second time, and runs off to her room with both the cord and the remote control. I figure she's done being a psycho for the night, so I cut my losses and begin surfing the web and listening to music on my headphones.
 
 
 I'm sitting on the couch listening to a good Hernan Cattaneo set since I can't even fucking watch TV in my own apartment. I notice a disturbance at the back of the apartment, and Dessa enters the living room YET AGAIN, standing directly in front of the TV. She begins to sing a hymn loudly and dance theatrically with her fucking god-forsaken Jesus tambourine, which she is STILL HOLDING. I ignore her and keep my headphones on. As it seems she is not getting enough attention, PSYCHO walks over and STANDS DIRECTLY ABOVE ME, pretty much leaning against my left leg, and BANGING THAT FUCKING TAMBOURINE IN MY FACE. I calmly tell her to quit standing over me, and she rebukes me in the name of Jesus, YET AGAIN.
 
 At this point, I'm waiting for Ashton Kutcher to jump out and yell ''YOU GOT PUNK'D!!!!!!&quot;. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen. My willpower resources that help me hold back my &quot;kill switch&quot; are running dangerously low. I want to rip her fucking head off with every thread of my being. This goes on for like 2 hours longer. 2 more fucking hours.
 
 2 HOURS LATER:
 
 Dessa finally stops chanting and retires to her room for a third or fourth or I dont even know how many fucking times she's come out to make me want to MURDER HER. Stacey and I figure it's safe to finally watch some TV. Before we even turn the thing on, Dessa bursts out of her room in some type of an insane rage. At this point, I'm sitting on the arm of the sofa closest to the front door discussing the &quot;little problem'' with Stacey. We do our best to ignore her presence. Dessa storms towards the couch, opens the front door and smashes it into my shoulder. She begins screeching: ''GET OUT, GET OUT, IN THE NAME OF THE LORD BLAHBLAHBLAH GET OUT&quot;. Finally pissed off enough to take some physical action, I say something along the lines of ''I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU IF YOU DONT STEP AWAY. YOU DONT WANT TO DIE TONIGHT, DO YOU?&quot; She smashes the door into me again, and I push it back into her. She loses her balance, and begins screaming about how she now has ''bruises on her arms&quot; and that she will file assault charges.....and you know what? IT GETS WORSE.
 
 This is around the time when Dessa decides to dial 911.....
 
 Stacey and I are in blatant shock and disbelief. Did she really dial just 911? Was she actually talking to cops? WHY did she dial 911? Are the cops actually coming...? and you know what? 
 
 
 10 minutes later....
 
 6 HEAVILY ARMED MEN (what looks to me like a god damn SWAT team) show up at our apartment at 4 IN THE FUCKING MORNING. Stacey and I are in a hazy disbelief, completely mystified by the sheer stupidity of the night's events. Dessa is screaming wildly while the brigade of police men watch in concern, fascination, and disgust. One of the cops escorts Stacey and I to a quiet area of the apartment, asking us if Dessa is on (or should be on) any meds that we are aware of. Neither of us know, as it's virtually impossible to have a normal conversation with this THING that we live with. The cop tells us that he's very sorry for us, and ceases questioning. Dessa is still upstairs with the 4 or 5 other guys who look bored and annoyed. The cops eventually leave. Seemingly exhausted by her crazy ass antics, Dessa wordlessly retires to her room (for good this time) after that fucked up grand finale.
 
 THE NEXT DAY
 
 After much debate, Stacey and I decide to make a report at the local police precinct, since Dessa has done damage to property owned by the landlord (throwing out random shit that didn't belong to her).
 
 Stacey and I come home and decide to watch some TV.
 
 OH MY FUCK, BAD IDEA. Dessa immediately scampers out of her room (as if she's fucking wired to the TV) accosting me for the remote control. She clutches it in her ugly talons, running outside with it and doing god knows what with it (it's still missing). In a swift and impulsive motion, I slam the front door and lock it. Take that, stupid bitch. After like 2 minutes, someone opens the door. I don't know where Dessa is.
 
 DESSA CALLS THE POLICE.
 
 More cops show up, and for some reason an ambulance is included in the mix...WHAT   THE   FUCK.
 Dessa begins raving again, and the police ask her if she would like to ''come with them&quot;. I'm fucking begging Yahweh that they'll haul her bitch ass to an asylum where she belongs. Unfortunately, they aren't legally allowed to take her away unless she lashes out at THEM directly. The cops leave, exasperated and annoyed. Dessa leaves the apartment. Good riddance.
 
 After a few hours, Dessa returns to the apartment flanked by two fat old women. What the fuck? She enters the apartment and informs us that we will be undergoing a religious intervention. By this time, I've gathered that the two women are church workers, here to help us undergo a spiritual transformation. Fucked up. Every tenant in the apartment (Stacey, Owen, Dessa, Me) are sat down by these women to have some sort of a discussion about the situation. Surprisingly, these church people seem almost half-reasonable (at least in comparison to Dessa, the horrendously crazy counterpart). We discuss the events of the previous night, and attempt to make some compromise. At one point, I notice that the conversation is going ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOWHERE, due to the obvious fact that mental patients are virtually impossible to reason with. I straight up leave the room in the middle of it all to go take a much-needed nap.

"event","Today I was dragged to see ''Paprika"", that new Satoshi KON film. I guess I'll say (without spoiling the film for whoever reads this) that I wanted all the characters to wake up in the end at....say..... an office-party-gone-awry, thinking: ""What the fuck was IN THAT CANDY BOWL???? LSD-25??!?!??!"" And yeah, it was. Trippy ass movie.<br /><br />Anyways. I suppose I haven't updated in quite some time....<br /><br />I worked for awhile this summer. <div class=""ljcut"" text=""SLICE"">My fantastic employment took place at an art shipping and storage company in the warehouse/asian prostitute district of Dallas. It was a boring, albeit decent job. I spent most of my time creating spreadsheets in microsoft excel, which was fairly suicide-inducing. My boss was a cool guy, although I'm pretty sure he thought I was a complete moron. He was actually dead-on in assuming this, seeing as I'm non-functional as a human being between 5AM and 3PM (this was an 8 to 5 job). The girl who did the front-desk job before me (and kind of trained me, I suppose) was nice, funny, nice. She'd type, I'd type, I'd give her faxes and shit. Fantastic relationship. Also, there was a whole group of people who did the actual art-handler work (mostly guys). Whenever they weren't working, they'd sit in the office and smoke, and I'd sit at the desk and feel awkward. They were all A-OK, and just kind of did whatever.&nbsp; OH, yes....and then...<br /><br />There was that guy.....yeah that GUYYYYY......<br /><br />I started stalking him.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />It started out as obsessive annoyance. I think his first words to me were.....something condescending? I was a very<i>....reluctant </i>employee. Reluctant to be social, that is. Because I had to work at the front desk, I was a fairly easy target for silly bullshit. I'd always know when that guy was coming into the office, because he was one of those people who slams around, and is always making some kind of racket. I'd sit at the desk and cringe.....""Oh god, please, no stupid questions/comments/remarks...Just...don't....look......up....""<br /><br />At some point he started making fun of my eyebrows. He said something really strange to me, along the lines of: ''Your eyebrows are distracting. Black and distracting."" Who the FUCK says that? I'd glance at him out of the corner of my eye and continue typing, and he'd apologize for being a dick. Of course, I had no response for him. Who would? Although I realized that he was just the good old jerk-at-work type, I was still fucking annoyed sometimes.<br /><br />Being really really really hideously bored does strange things to me. Because work was pretty mundane, I'd spend way too much time fantasizing about ruining this guy's life. Out of the aforementioned boredom, I started finding stuff out about him: standard things, like where he lives, email, age, blah blah. Just stuff.&nbsp; After a while, I realized ""Hey! This is pretty sick!"" and quit digging. <br /><br />LOWDOWN TIME:<br /><br />SO, he was in his 30's. I won't provide a name. Chronic sunglasses-wearer, which was actually a huge source of annoyance. I could never tell if he was actually talking in my direction because all I could see were his God-forsaken black shiny shades. Otherwise, he was a regular-looking guy. Brown hair, about, ohhh.....I'd say 5'10''? Tannish skin, probably from working outside all the time, and the smile of a real jerk-ass. For the most part, a regular voice, although he talked with this chronicly-hungover drunken slur. A lot of times when he'd call the office, I'd pick up the phone and I wouldn't understand what the fuck he was trying to tell me. I guess I could also add that he was one of those people who you would automatically assume has brown eyes, just by looking at the rest of him, and by taking into account that he never took off his damn sunglasses. He seemed really arrogant, almost fascinatingly so. I also wondered on a regular basis how many times he got fucked up beyond comprehension in his lifetime. On any occasion that he actually got me to talk, anything I'd say about myself was complete and total bullshit.<br /><br />I quit working at said art shipping-and-handling place when my employers found out I was going to college out of state in the fall. I actually lied about that in the first place. The job was too far away anyways.<br /><br />Moral of the story: DON'T FUCKING HIRE ME.<br /><br />Near the end of the short span of time I worked there, that annoying guy came up to my desk to ask me when my last day was. Without looking up from my computer work, I shrugged and replied: ''Tuesday"". He then asked me (in his typical jerky tone) ""but what DAY is that?"" I was reluctant to respond. This time, however, he had taken the damn sunglasses off and I could tell he was actually talking to me. I glanced up from my work, and all I could muster was a weak ''I don't know''.<br /><br />His eyes were so God damn clear gorgeous blue.</div>"

"event","Once long ago, there was an older woman who lived in a very small house on a hill. Everyone knew her simply as &quot;Grandma Fishstick&quot;. Grandma Fishstick was the grandmother of four children, appropriately named 1, 2, 3 and X. Every night, the four children would gather at Grandma Fishstick's house to eat dinner, and every night the children were served the same dish: Fishsticks. Like all foods, fishsticks are OK at first. However, after awhile the same exact food will become so tiresome that it cannot continue to be eaten (as a matter of fact, one would probably rather eat fried vomit once in a while). Because of this same unavoidable inclination to dislike a food that one has been forcefed for an extended period of time, the children began to contemplate a rebellion against Grandma Fishstick's cooking endeavors. One Day, the eldest child, Child 1, gathered up the courage to ask Grandma Fishstick why she never served anything for dinner except for fishsticks.

Grandma Fishstick looked at Child 1 and inquired:&quot;Child 1, do you mean to tell me that you no longer love my fishsticks, which I have worked hard to create for you so dearly and so tenderly?&quot;

There was a long silence, as Child 1 pondered this. He finally replied: &quot;Dearest Grandma Fishstick, it is just that we have been eating fishsticks for the past 3 years now, and I would really enjoy something else to eat for dinner...perhaps a stuffed quail? I am very very tired of eating fishsticks. I actually have developed quite a distaste for them!&quot;

Grandma Fishstick's expression became blank. Her face then contorted, and she said: &quot;Come here Child, I have something else for you to eat after all.&quot;

With that, Grandma Fishstick took Child 1 out to her quaint back yard and beat him with a pair of pliers until his siblings had finished eating dinner. Grandma Fishstick then said to Child 1: &quot;I am regretfully aware of the contempt that you hold for my fishsticks, which I have lovingly crafted for your eating delights. From this moment and hereafter, instead of feeding you fishticks for dinner, I will bring you to this very spot and beat you with this same pair of pliers.&quot;


Bewildered and distressed by Grandma Fishstick's sudden anger, Child 1 confided in his siblings, and revealed to them the frightening encounter with Grandma Fishstick. Of course, all of 3 of his siblings were clearly aghast and astonished as Child 1 revealed to them the cuts and bruises he had received during the backyard episode.

As time passed, Child 1 became used to his daily beatings, and his siblings continued to eat fishsticks every day for dinner. After almost a year had passed since the first pliers incident, Child 2 began to contemplate which was the worst of two evils: eating fishsticks every day, or being beaten with a pair of pliers during dinner. On a brisk Thursday night, Child 2 bravely decided to ask the same question his older sibling had asked a year ago. Very predictably, Grandma Fishstick brought Child 2 into the backyard and had him stand in a patch of dry grass next to a dilapidated tool shed. Child 2 fully expected Grandma fishstick come from the shed with a pair of pliers, and trembled in fear when she emerged with a hammer."

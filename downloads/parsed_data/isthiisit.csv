"event","Today I met Bud the drummer of sublime
he talked about drugs
He said exactly how Brad Nowell looked when he died

Brad said he would to heroin one more time so he did
in the morning he looked over at Brad naked and feet hanging 
off the bed and said "" looks like you had a rough night huh""?
and Brad didnt respond
Lou dog was hovered over him whimpering
So Bud looked at Brad and he was pale blue and Dead Cold
He had Bile and mucus all over his face..
that was to be the last day Bud would do heroin


Sublime was a talented band even though they give me bad memories
i respect Bud alot
because unlike alot of people
He had succeeded in bettering himself and admitted to being wrong

But Nothing By Pedro The Lion
Has The Best Lyrics I Have Ever Heard

if only the rules were built upon philosophy that i embraced
i'd hug your neck and kiss your face
but its very obvious that your ideals are not for me
you'll tell me what to do
but you will see that i do as i please 
cause i want to do it my wayx2
i want to flyx2



the problem with rules is they alienate the criminals
when whose to say if what they did was wrong that day
if you'd open your mind up
you'd see that there is nothing that's always wrong
no matter what you say
it's just not true that there's only one way
cuz i want to do it my wayx2
cuz i want to flyx2


i hope we have ourselves an understanding"

You see the waters nothing against your face
the Ice replaces leaves
And truth wakes me from dreams
I watched as clean earth you gave me
Convert to bleeding sea
ive made a Pile On The Floor
Of All The Letters ive written for her
and the glass thats broken is becoming whole
linked together frozen by snow
Brings back memories we thought forgotten
drowning silently in waves of autumn
She will be waiting
to the sea

I Wrote for you my way
On a dollar bill
i am yours for crying when you are away
I pray for how you feel
Ill will be holding your things
until you come home
Pretty darling when the birds begin to sing
i will see you again
when you return from within
the teeth of a metal sea

Wherever you are i hope that you will be safe
i held you when you were crying
and i felt your pain in me
Sleep pretty darling Theres nothing we can do now

let us think of this
as nothing more than it is
lets never come back here again
because it wouldn't be as fun
let us walk and never look back
to see the other left behind
and let us think of this 
as nothing, because it is

we have to part
to be apart
two hands hold, two hands let go
Come Close
let me whisper in your ear
all the things I don't want to say
That you don't want to hear
you have something (some new friend) when you leave here
I'll only find myself lost
Lost again
Lost in our langauge and lost in translation

i kissed you goodbye
but i didn't mean it
I can never let you go
Even if I have to be alone
I walked, I didn't look back
Because I didn't want you to see me cry

* You might wanna skip the picture detail and read the poem first*

This Story is of an old Ant
Sitting at a bar 
Singing the story of his life
hes half drunk
and no one is really listening
But he Still sings..

...
When First I Saw The Sun
I Thought That I Was Dreaming
(An Ant with a Mining hat on squinting up at a crack in the dirt)

Of a Heaven comming through the walls
They Told Me I was crazy
(Other ants laughing at him and the queen ant looking displeased)

i escaped and it took a while to get my legs
So i ran off to the sea
(Ant Running to a puddle)

I Built a boat and sailed away
to were she'd never find me
(Ant sailing on a leaf)

What i say ive seen and what ive seen is true
and if i am lieing let lightning strike me down
(goes back to showing the drunk ant and hes standing on a table yelling this to everyone)

But...if you only knew..
That even death the worst of words..is the prettiest of sounds
(drunk ant sitting there restrained by bigger ants)

The seasons came and the seasons went
and happy were my seasons spent
(showing the ant as his young self holding the hand of a girl ant)

Though with happiness comes deep regret
and saddness has its turn
(shows the girl and getting carried away by a bird)

But i have chased a shooting star
and have tamed a killer
(other ants laughing at him in disbelief)
(picture of him standing on a cats nose while the cat is sleeping)

Nothing compares
To When Your Aware
That Simple Things Are For living

(shows ant sailing away across the water)

Above The Grass And Through The Trees
Past The Sand Unto To Sea
Does Beauty Still Remain
In An Ocean Made Of Fallen Leaves
Elegance In Simplicity
We Always Stay The Same
And When We Feel There Is Nothing Left
Like The Dark Is Rising From The West
The Niave Find True Happiness
Nothing We Do Comes Easy...

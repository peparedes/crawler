"event","I have, for the seventh time, just quit smoking.  I am an asshole with NO will power, and this time, two months before my 30th birthday, I am done and will be done.  I have tried to figure out many solutions to make this an easy break.  I have considered hypnosis.  I have considered going to a resort in Napa Valley for people coming off nicotine.  It's very beautiful and spiritual... Yoga every day, support groups, your own villa located in the flush green of beautiful Napa Valley.  Right, like that's worth $3,064 dollars.  I could go to Europe with that money.  I am fucking done.  I am fucking done.  I am sick of stinking.  I am sick of my house smelling like an ashtray.  I am sick of what it does to my skin.  I am sick of killing myself slowly.  I am done. I am done.  People please help me, I am so done."

"event","My life is a good one... I have gotten the chance to try everything, things both good and bad, but I have always come back.  I experimented with drugs, I am and have been extremely promiscuous, but I am here now, I am with it, I know where to draw the line, I know when to pull in the reins.  And I hope that if friends saw that maybe my reins were giving me trouble, that maybe they'd lend a helping hand. Isn't that what friends are for?  But what if someone used to be a friend?  What if this someone that used to be a friend was lost, unwilling to accept help, and all anyone could do was watch from the sidelines as he throws what could be an overly productive life out the window?  Wake the fuck up, people... Look around, and don't let life get the best of you.  Now you will go home and re-think your life."

"event","Rehearsals and call backs are over, I have come out victorious with the part of Queen Elizabeth, and I am afraid I may have bitten off more than I can chew.  Oh well, I can do it, pretty sure I can, anyway.  I learned to speak English and a little bit of Spanish, so surely I can catch on to Elizabethan English, right?  
I have been playing X-Box, Star wars: Knights of the Old Republic.  I am a total geek, I know, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's the best game ever.  (*nerd, nerd, nerd)  
Can anyone tell me how to link journal entries so that the entire thing is via link only?
Alright, I am about to expose something a tad embarrassing, don't laugh at me, please.  Last night I was about to go to bed and watch a movie called 'Live Flesh'.  I knew it was a foreign film, but that is all I knew about it (Netflix rocks)... Anyway, two days ago Dave and I went on an adult movie shopping spree, as we attempt to do monthly, and we picked up a Rocco film, and then two others that we bought for friends as gag gifts.  One of them involved a midget and a woman that was purchased for my friend because she thought it would be humorous to give Dave a midget in a box for his birthday, and then she got stuck on midget's, so now she gets to watch them having sex, yummy.  Well, I am still learning how to use the entertainment system in our bedroom, I get thoroughly confused with the input select buttons, the tv/vcr buttons, and so when I get the DVD player to work, it's a miracle.  I did it, and the words 'Live Flesh' came up on my television screen, so I grabbed what I thought to be the DVD remote and pushed play.  Suddenly there are two girl's walking in a park in total slut wear, little skirts, their asses hanging out, and I am instantly amazed that Netflix is carrying something so dirty, but the girl's (one of them, anyway) were talking Spanish, and I had just seen the title of my movie I wished to view, so I figured it must be right.  I continued watching in amazement as the girl's get their nipples sucked in this park, they then load into a car and go back to some house, and they start to get it on.  Suddenly, the girl's take off their pants, and they have peckers, baby!  Instead of pushing play on the DVD player, I pushed play on the VCR, and watched twenty minutes of a she-male video we got for another friend.  Who's the sucker now? Ha-ha."

"event","Had auditions for Richard the III tonight, and just so happened to stumble upon the last of the Rocky Horror Picture Show auditions.  In Boulder the Show, if you will, was fun, but here... Ugggh, here it brings out the people that don't leave their houses but twice a year when Rocky goes up.  Seriously, though, it was very scary, and when asked if I was going to audition, I smiled nicely and said NO.  I am all for the slut wear of the show, but the people are a bit insane and spending a huge amount of time with them might force me to begin talking in tongues.  I'll know by Saturday if I get the part, Lady Anne, and I am simply doing this one to get over my fear of Shakespeare.  The challenge will be good for me, and being in a play is really just an excuse to drag my friends down to our shitty little town.  My audition was pretty good.  It was about a woman, full with kids and family, who just got diagnosed with breast cancer.  Not to harp on a very serious subject, but I at one point felt myself up and declared, ""I know there's not much here, but they're my tits, and they are mine.""
We leave for Vegas next week, more debauchery in Sin City to be had.  We're going to see Zumanity, the new Cirque show, and staying at the Venetian, oh la la.  Planning on shooting a few pictures with one of my girlfriends, and planning to forget about Art History, if only for four days.  My teacher is actually good this time; I may not end up bailing on this class as I have done in the past.  Off to bed, I have school in five hours..."

Most people might think it's quite lame, but it's got a spunky groove that either A: Makes one want to jump up and down to the booming of the music, or B: Fuck like crazy.  I am hoping for selection B, sounds like it may feel better and be ultimately more enjoyable.  The song has now switched, and it is another booming version of ""Because the Night Belongs to Others.""  One can't help but love this version.  Great music to clean the house to, it's a cup of Espresso, it's meth.  We are, for the third time in a week in a half, locking ourselves in our house and having a party.  No one is invited to said party, well, not yet, anyway.  We plan to eat, fuck, consume mass quantities of Viagra (not me, him), watch more porn, yada yada yada.  We leave on Friday morning for the folks house for the weekend, so expelling built up energy, sexual or otherwise, is vital to our well being as healthy functioning adults.

We had dinner, and sat around on the computer.  We had good sex somewhere in there, as well.  So Dave was on yahoo!  Messenger talking to guys here, who would maybe want to get crazy and play.  Boom, here is the evidence that this town is way too small.  Benway sent my picture out to two, count them two people that ended up knowing who I was, both from school.  The first guy knew my real name and told Dave he sat next to me in Logic's class.  Then he started babbling about love, and the freeness of meaning, or something neither of us understood.  Then, he was flirting with this other guy, sent out my picture, and the response was, ""Oh, I have kissed her before.""  This made me a bit nervous, only because I could behave pretty badly at the strip club (not responsible like some stripper's I know, hehe).  Turns out this guy was in a play with me, and played my boyfriend.  Made me nervous, because now even more of the school knows I am a dirty whore.  Shit, it sucks to be me.

"event","I fell down a hill in the desert today.... I was attempting to pull Dave's truck up said hill, set with a collar and a leash, in front of the truck.  The hill was quite steep, and I lost my footing, and boom!  I slid down the hill and around the truck, my collar AND leash broke, and I landed at the foot of the hill, bleeding and stupid.  I heard Dave calling me, and he jolted down the hill, running around the truck, and picked me up off the ground, all the while supressing his hysterics and trying not to break the camera.... It was fucking funny, and I see that.  See, I CAN be funny.  Then, we decided to change locations, so both of us jumped into the truck and left.  An hour later Dave looked down at himeself, and with confusion, says, ""did you grab my pants?""  Huh?  The ones I happened to be SITTING on an hour ago after I fell down the hill?  The pants that have a couple hundred dollars in the pocket?  Those pants? No.  We had, by that time, driven over hills that seemed like mountains, changed directions 20 times, and were thouroughly confused.... We really had no clue where to find said pants, other than a half of car as a marker, and boy, it would have been hilarious if he had to drive home in his underwear (why was he in his underwear in the desert anyway? hmmmm).  There is shit like this all over the desert, you know.  Cars cut in half with rust holes in them, man made bridges that could easily and almost did cause severe injury, bicycle wheels, etc.  So we finally found his pants, laying there all alone as if the owner laid down, and vanished.  Peculair, hmmmm.
The lesson, boys and girls, is please don't try to pull a 6,000 lb. vehicle up as steep hill, that's just a little silly, and pretty stupid."

"event","It's difficult to sit down to write without cigarettes, my mind wanders frequently, attention span is short.  Here is a funny story, I will do my best to pay it tribute correctly, and I hope my words do not fail me.  A few nights ago I went to Mexico with Steph and her brother, Tim.  We went down, sat ourselves at an eating establishment, ordered food and drinks, and began talking and dancing with the hundreds of winter visitors who frequent Mexico during the winter.  Steph started out with a strawberry Margarita, and unbeknownst to me, this was how the rest of the night went.  Her slamming down drinks, me offering her some of my Coca-Cola, her refusing.  We got hit up by vendor after vendor; selling jewelry of all colors and shapes, fake tattoos, ponchos, sunglasses, backpacks.  People would just come up to us, especially the fake tattoo vendor when he spotted all of my 'stickers,' as he called them, and they began bartering a price with such desperation that I would feel as if they were trying to escape a tornado.  We said no to everything, until a man walked up with a large, shiny, ceramic cock that doubles as a pencil holder.  I bought one, several of the winter visitors laughed so loudly that for a split second I almost felt embarrassed, and boom, the trend started.  I took a pen out of my purse, stuck it in the tip of the cock, and the guy sold another five cocks within ten minutes.  We danced to some American oldies with a Spanish twist, ate chips, guacamole, and enchiladas.  We then decided a change of environment would be splendid, so we headed towards the strip club, which is actually a brothel where the girls will do anything for money (this is the only time they dance, too, is if you shove a five in their face and promise more, but then they will do ANYTHING, no holds barred).  Steph seemed okay to me at this point, or I would have jumped on her chest and poured some water down her gullet, and then she fell in love.  Steph is a crazy girl, but she is young and does not do well with female competition in the least, and I have never known her to become smitten with another female, EVER.  However, sitting at the bar is a girl, maybe about 19 years old, wearing a tiny pair of cut up shorts, a little tube top, and she is sitting with a man at least fifty years her senior, allowing him to rub her legs and her belly.  The man looks Caucasian, with a large mop of snow white hair, a big belly, a nice smile, yet he has that look I know so well buried deep within his eyes, the look of an overly horny male. Steph fell in love, dragged me up to the bar in order to get close to this girl, so we bought her a drink and asked her, well, no, it didn't happen that way.  She spoke not one word of English, but her friend was bilingual, so he began the negotiations.  She would dance, but more importantly she would go back to our room and do anything for a mere $100.00US.  Steph began rummaging through her purse, telling her brother (she was a bit weird since her brother was there) all she wanted to do was make the girl bark like a dog.  I knew this was a lie, Steph in her drunk state wanted this girl, and I had to explain that we couldn't spend $100.00 on this girl, we didn't even have a room, and we were in Mexico.  I have NO idea what is legal and what is not, and it would not please Dave in the slightest if I were to get locked up in prison for buying a prostitute.  We all know communicating with the amazingly drunk is impossible, it is like trying to break down a wall made of pure iron with a feather.  The girl danced, buried an old ladies head in her pussy, kissed Steph's feet and crawled on my lap.  It was time to go, and when this time came, Steph ran outside angry and resentful because she couldn't have what she wanted.

By this time she can barely walk, and she runs into her brother's cigarette, and a blood curdling scream exits her mouth into the cold black night in the streets of a foreign place.  We have yet to pass through customs, she is hysterical, screaming about how her brother tried to kill her as she falls to the dirty ground.  We get her hoisted onto Tim's back, I pull out her ID, and she is still crying, big alligator tears streaming down her face, as she holds her hand out to any stranger that passes, showing them her burn.  The Customs guy has obviously seen this scene before, he looks at us and simply waves us through as Tim makes some excuse that Steph doesn't do well with dentists.  We are almost home when Steph begins crying again, we stop the car, she dives out onto the highway and crawls through the sandbox of desert dirt, and begins heaving.  I am thanking Cran that I have remained sober, that I can talk to her without killing her, and she rolls around and over and practically mummifies herself in the dirt.  The scene lasted another two hours once I delivered her to her husband, I started an IV on her, I got in the bathtub with her, I drugged her up and put her to sleep, all of which I could have done by myself, but she would let me do nothing until she spoke with Dave on the phone first. Her husband is about to ship out to Iraq, she refuses to show him she is afraid of his six month absence, and all those pent up feelings came tumbling into his face, none of which she remembers at all.  I talked to her tonight, and he is supposed to leave tomorrow.  I asked her if she was alright, and she answers that of course she is.  Well, I didn't have the heart to tell her of her explosion, she would only carry that anger against herself for another week, and shit, we all fuck up.  She has promised to jump on my non-alcoholic bandwagon with me, but she has never done this before.  I simply learned how difficult a drug alcohol really is.  If one is happy with no secrets, it can loosen you up and make you have a jolly good time.  If one has secrets, it sends the world spinning violently out of control with no breaks in sight.  Just like life, huh?"

We leave for Phoenix tomorrow to see Dave's folks, where the food is always mouth watering and the company pleasent.  We are then staying a couple of nights by ourselves in the city, and you all can see where this is leading, right?  Perversion, lurking, and a few macabre scenarios are ensured.  I am staying with DNA, respectively, while in New York, so I shall send loads of love from all parties involved and bring back any messages or smoke signals that are packed into my luggage upon the arrival home.  I, however, will not be snowboarding, as I have broken way too many fingers on the Colorado slopes (and I have no cute bunny outfit).  Now, before I depart, can someone use their words and describe the color magenta?"

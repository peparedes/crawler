Join me in the night  

tonight we leave 
our woes behind
out of sight
forget your roots and climb

so catch me if you can
all night and well never land

come on lady, burning and fading
come on lovely, get up and hug me

the moon in paper
airplane flight
soon well see
the morning light
Its me you want
with burning eyes
to be your only
midnight ride

come on lady, burning and fading
love me lovely, get up and hug me

join me in the night my baby
we'll fly out till morning light
I got nothin left my baby
you can come into my life

join me in the night"

Then we walked around and met these two girls from homewood, they were pretty cool. A lot cooler than most of the other people there.  Then we spent the night at battitos, and that was awesome.

After them we ran into the all of the foys minus the parents. Then i saw some local band, and North Mississippi all stars, which was ok, not great, but they did do the coolest thing i saw all night. The drummer got up from the drumset, picked up a washboard and used like wah, chorus and flange effects on it and then the bassisst and the singer(who was on drums now) played like techno beats behind him. that was pretty sweet. And then i saw Govt mule, which was a bit dissapointing, it just didnt work somehow and there was so much bass it felt like some weak dude was throwin steaks at your chest and the bass washed out everything else, it was pretty bad. And then we saw the black crowes, and they were pretty good, i was surprised. Then after them we went to the arbys in the middle of the ghetto with the foys. good times man."

"event","Ooooookaaaaaaaaay!&nbsp; so me n laura went too white rose yesterday n did some shopping while leah pants was at work :). i bought&nbsp;a new outfit, and gree hair extentions BUT i lost the buggers :@ which im well pissed off about cos they were really nice and i bought my outfit too coordinate around the greenness!&nbsp; So i ended up buying green jeany 3/4's, a black n green skull top, n other stuff.

Then me n laura went too morrisons too get some chicken and too see mo, but he wasnt there so we just got the chicken (y).&nbsp; then we went back to our own houses n ate the chicken n i talked too her on msn as well as dan which i made a comlete dick of myself, like ya know when something bad happens n u never know what too do or say ""/&nbsp; it was like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

ANYWAYS, then i got dressed n leah n laura came for me.&nbsp; we went too leahs uni house n put our makeup on n tidied ourselves up a bit n then went too buy some booze [and in my case, lucozade] then we went too Ben's house too play on the Wii - which i fucking LOVE and rock at btw \m/ ahahahaha.
then the taxi came n took us too bondi, i wasnt gonna drink BUT the cocktail guy gave me one for free [i mean he didnt take my ticket] and OH MY GOD how many fittttt guys??&nbsp; :].&nbsp; damn them and theyre super fitnesss ahhh well my time will come soon i hope :)!
we all boogied on the rotating dancefloor [which is a bastard to get on and off when youre sober so fuck knows how leah n that managed it when they were drunk!&nbsp; for agessssssss BUT it was really warm after a while, so i usually went too the bar or toilets even if I didnt need it, just too cool down =p

me n laura left at like 1ish cos we both had too be up early n that, leah rolled into bed at like 4:45 ahahahm, the dirty little stop-out!&nbsp; LOL!.
so we all set off this morning like at 7 too get too work n that n i got home at like half past, the traffic wasnt even that bad!!&nbsp; so i had breakfast with my mummy n that, got changed n that n then abi picked me up and here i am at work!

I think lack of sleep is startin too catch up with me n that now, cos i havent been able too stop yawning, n i can feel myself getting tired BUT now im all awake n alert n stuff.&nbsp; :).

Just got a text off Kate sayin one of the house people who viewed the house is wanting too move in n i had too ring her too explain n stuff, i do kinda miss her at times n that but i know ive proper fucked up my chances of bein mates with her, with all that happened n that.&nbsp; shes apologised about bein a bitch but then again she had total reason too be... i left them in the shit, so its only fair that i fixed it... i didnt want too leave all them a person down on the house next year so i thought rather than just find my replacement find one for the spare room too.&nbsp; which luckily all has worked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
god my behaviour is fucked.&nbsp; sometimes i wish i could openly speak about my feelins n stuff but i find it easier too write stuff down n that cos thats always been what ive been able too do.&nbsp; but when its on paper you cant read what i was feelin at the time n its hard too write emotions i suppose, especially as i was feeling a few months ago!!&nbsp;

ive sorted out my doc appointment, its on the 25th may at 3:30 not the 28th as i originally thought!!&nbsp; so we'll know then what is actually up with me n that.&nbsp; im gonna stop researchin shit cos its just like totally confusin me.
Me n laura were havin 'pillow talk' [LMAO!.] last night n she said through our friendship shes noticed my mood swings n that BUT some of them have been linked too things happenin in my life; like when my grandad got cancer i was depressed then for agesss too, although not too the extent i was last time BUT i still the 'bad thoughts' i mean how fucked is that havin them thoughts at like 14/15 years old????&nbsp;
Then again ive been totally hyper for weeks months on end and 'normal' again its like ahhhhhhhhhhhh!&nbsp; i wish there was like an easy fix on the internet too give me like a rough diagnosis so i can take it too the docs n say 'my friends were worried about my behaviour... blah blah, so i went on too the internet n i found this... is it right'&nbsp; ya know what i mean?

ive just shouted bananahammock really loud n made leia jump hahahah [richards gone walk abouts so leias my next victim muahaaaaaaaaa]!

think im gonna have a few nights in n that, i want too go out but my mummys taken my main bank card away from me so i cant so much - boooooooooooo!&nbsp; ALTHOUGH i am gonna get that tattoo.&nbsp; i wanna save n go too leeds n on holiday but i just cant theres so much i want n stuff!&nbsp; my bank balance is gonna be really low n i proper want too go too peterborough too see dan...&nbsp; gahhhhhh im fucked!&nbsp; i want too be in a relationship, but i dont have time n if i do end up bein diagnosed with it then im gonna need time too adjust n rebuild my life cos its a life long illness n ill need too rebuild as a person, cos its like devastatin init?&nbsp;:/

i need a drink *toddles off*....................................................................................................................... ive put my dinner in too :)! mmmm lasagne!
i want leah too get back too me cos i proper want too get this tattoo!!&nbsp; grrrr i bet shes still asleeping!&nbsp; bless!

ANYWAYS ill leave it at that cos im rambling n that :)!!

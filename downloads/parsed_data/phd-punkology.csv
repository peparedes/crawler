(i had a craving 2 watch it) then i went upstairs and attempted 2 fall asleep. then it started 2 thunderstorm, and i wuz listening 2 it, and watching the lightning light up my room. then finally i fell asleep. 2day we're going 2 go 2 the mall, then probably go see a movie. but anywayz, im out</FONT></EM>"

"event","How do you get over someone who's been the biggest part of your life for more than <b>four years</b>?<br />How do you comprehend the fact that the thing you held most dear was ceased for no concrete reason?<br />How do you heal from being run through, twisted for half a year, and subsequently ripped out?<br />How do you trust anybody ever again when someone so immaculately-natured can cause so much pain?<br />How do you try to feel better when every day is a reminder of how substandard you seem to be?<br />How do you stop feeling self-critical, even when says it really is not your fault?<br />How do you start over again with anybody when you tried the best you can to no avail?<br />How do you go from feeling that you're one of the few lucky ones in the world to getting, so to speak, sniped?<br />How do you still love her so you can't be angry, just like you never were, but still escape the pain?<br />How do you fathom the lack of feeling guilt on her side, like nothing ever happened?<br />How do you ever feel loved again?<br /><br />How do you deal with all the questions that still remain?<br /><br /><br />Life has too many questions, but not enough damn answers. Just when you think all of them are answered, like a slow, hanging curve, life decides to throw a 100 mph fastball at your head."

Wario's side-B is the Wario Chopper, in which he hops on and starts racing. However, if you choose to get off the bike, it will stay on screen, so hop on to ride again! His down-B is the infamous Wario Waft. This move charges over time, so if you don't use it for a while, the results are tremendous, but if you keep using it...it's pretty lame.<br /><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/images/wario/wario_070629a.jpg"" alt="""" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/images/wario/wario_070629e.jpg"" alt="""" />"

"event","so i got an idea this evening and i figured i'm going to try it out, since i don't really have time to lay down a big entry saying what i've been up to every so often - i'm wondering what kind of response it'll get, if any of you want to try it out as well, be my guest! you don't even have to say you mooched it off of me.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>QUESTION of the DAY:</b><br /><br />Every day, I am going to post a question to this livejournal. It may be rhetorical, it may be random nonsense, or it may be very meaningful to me. Regardless, it will involve some part of my day - so it will be an indirect update, more or less.<br /><br /><u>If you think you have an answer to the question</u>, I would LOVE a response to the post. A couple to a few days after I have posted the entry, I'll look over all the comments, if they exist, and pick out my favorite answer, replying to it as such. However, I will not elaborate on the question itself - if you really want to know more, then drop me an AIM message (same SN as LJ).<br /><br />And for good measure, I'll fire up iTunes and press play to get a random song from my library to put in the ""music"" slot. Because I love music that much. Comment on that if you want too, I guess.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />...*random embed, cuz this is amazing*<br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""3"" />"

"event","<b>""MY ADVENTURE-AND-A-HALF""</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So I just had a WONDERFUL weekend at Michigan State!<br /><br /><br /><br />Did I have the most crap-tastic ""adventure-and-a-half"" of my life? Ohhhhhhhhhhh yes.<br /><br /><br />It seemed wonderful at first; a bus route that was usually four hours to State had been clipped to a direct route lasting two hours!! Get there at 3 PM Friday, leave at 6:40 PM Sunday! Wowww!!!<br /><br />So I call a taxi Friday afternoon to get to the bus station. Along the way (after this guy was rather late), listening to a movie review of ""Reign Over Me"" on NPR (do cabbies ALWAYS listen to NPR???), I noticed the engine warning light was switched on. Typically not good, I figure I'm only in here for ten minutes, and thought nothing more of it. Did it help that he was taking backwoods to get to the station? Not really, thought my stressed mind.<br /><br />Get to the station safe and sound. All right. Good.<br /><br />The bus makes a stop in Jackson, MI along the way. Wait twenty-minutes for half the people on the bus to take a smoke break (plus the Samuel L. Jackson-esque driver to incessantly smoke his pipe - YES A PIPE). Bus smells nasty with all the different smoky smells, gross. 15 minutes into the second part of the trip, about a third of the way to East Lansing...POP.<br /><br />Ohhhhhh shit.<br /><br />The bus refuses to go faster than like 30 mph. At first I thought it was gas issues (if you were smoking your god-damn pipe for 20 minutes, why not check the gas meter???).<br /><br />But ohhhhhhhhh no.<br /><br />Turns out the ""turbo"" (dunno if that's the real term) blew out. We trudged back to the Jackson bus station, where ""phone calls had to be made,"" and all that shit.<br /><br />We get back to Jackson. It is now 3:10, when I was SUPPOSED to be at State.<br /><br />...<br /><br />It is now 5:30. We are STILL FUCKING IN JACKSON without a damn clue what's going on. I go ask Sam L. what's goin on. He says he's clueless as the rest of us and we just gotta wait for another bus. Lo' and behold, one shows! FINALLY we get the hell outta there.<br /><br />Get to State at 6:00 ish, around three hours after I should have been there.<br /><br />...<br />(insert relaxing weekend with my darling here)<br />...<br /><br />6:30 PM, Sunday night. We made it to the East Lansing bus station. I'm optimistic, things can't go wrong, can they? Mine's supposed to leave at 6:40 anyhow.<br /><br />One bus is there. It's going to Grand Rapids.<br /><br />Another bus pulls up. It's going to Detroit.<br /><br />The five or so people just waiting there plus me are wondering...where the hell is an Ann Arbor bus?<br /><br />Bus driver of the GR bus tells us. IT BROKE DOWN and was at the Lansing station having a mechanic looking at it. So we could either:<br /><br />1) Take the GR bus to Lansing, and wait who-knows-how-long for the bus we need to be fixed.<br /><br />2) Take the Detroit bus to Detroit, but we have to have our own ride take us back from Detroit to The Deuce.<br /><br />The A^2-bound group decides ""well, let's think about what we should do..."" Except that no sooner than a minute after we convene, the bus drivers just pick up and LEAVE. GONE.<br /><br />One lady who's overheard the situation decides she can take some of us in her SUV to Lansing. Only three people fit in. I'm definitely not one of them (they would have still had to wait a while...).<br /><br />I'm stranded. Kelly feels bad. Can't do anything about it. Call my parents...and the only real option is they had to drive out from Troy to pick me up, and then drive me to Ann Arbor. They didn't mind doing it...but they definitely would have preferred staying home.<br /><br />Long story short, the Greyhound buses sucked this weekend. What were supposed to be direct-routes were anything but. I had an engineering meeting that I felt terrible to miss, but I had no choice but to. Got back an hour-ish after I would have normally though, and I guess that's better than the indeterminate amount if I had stayed in Lansing...<br /><br /><br />Moral: Take your transportation for granted, college kids. And bad omens are typically not good. But I don't know if you wanna say Samuel L. Jackson cloned smoking a pipe is a good omen or not."

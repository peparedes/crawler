"event","I am starting to get myself together to sort my house, with a small inheritance from my mum.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Having got the roof fixed, clearing the cellar is next. I can't believe what I've kept, over the years, mostly broken things that I thought for some mad reason I would be able to mend. Or something. What an optimistic loony I used to be!<br /><br />I got a skip. A colleague wisely suggested that you should always get a bigger skip than you think you need, so I got a &quot;builders skip&quot; on a seven-day hire, which turned out not to be big enough. I am <em>appalled </em>by how much total <em>junk&nbsp;</em>I had. It's been so excellent, though. I overfilled it, and worried what to do: but hey! no probs! Obviously, half the contents vanished, so I could put more in, and the level dropped, and I&nbsp; put more in...and the level dropped... Like magic, only mouldier, and without the sparkle.<br /><br />There were great doyng-ings and clunkings most nights, and when I looked out of the window, there was a bloke in the skip ferreting away industriously through the grossest, damp old stuff. He made regular trips to see what I had added. I felt pressured to keep coming up with more! No evenings off for me!<br /><br />I also kept having to trot to the front door to see how things were getting along. What had gone, what had arrived: a bag of rusty golf clubs showed up one evening, and vanished again within a couple of hours. It was pleasantly interactive,&nbsp;like an exchange point for the neighbourhood.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it. My skip.<br /><br />At Home Daughter says I was getting obsessed, and indeed, now it's gone I miss it...But wait! The cellar isn't finished, and I have realised that there are lots of things around the house that are just crying out to be skipped, so I am getting another one.<br /><br />Hooray!<br /><br />"

"event","It's all go here.&nbsp;<br /><br />The council have changed the recycling people, and we can now, finally, put out cardboard and plastic / polythene bottles, which the old lot wouldn't take. The first effect was that they missed our street out, and took nothing at all. I dragged it all back in, because you can't leave it out for a fortnight, and put it back out the next time. Hey Presto! They didn't take it again! So I dragged a months worth back in. Some people left their stuff out, and it got taken away the next day. Bugga them! The leaflet said the collection day wouldn't change. But it has. So that left me with 6 weeks worth of old cans and bottles and heavy newspaper etc. to put out the next fortnight. &nbsp;How glad am I that I always&nbsp;wash the empty&nbsp;cat food tins!<br /><br />Last week I got the lot out, all 6 weeks worth, and it was collected! Woot! I left the empty recycle&nbsp;bin and bag by the back gate, cos I was FED UP with having a kitchen full of old cans. <strong><em>So </em></strong>I took some stuff out&nbsp;yesterday, and the students next door have stuffed their bag AND MINE <strong><em>full</em> </strong>of giant size polythene milk bottles! Aaargh! It's not collected till Friday, and everything is full!&nbsp; And what a lot of giant milks! I know there are quite a few of them (students, not milk bottles)&nbsp;crammed in next door, but even so... &nbsp;Are they copying the ancient Romans, and bathing in it? If so they are WRONG. It's supposed to be asses milk. The fools.<br /><br />And poor Siam has had a bad few days, too. She's been to the vets with a poorly eye, which turned out to be a nasty scratch right across her eyeball, caused almost certainly by Bad Spider, who jumps out on her and attacks her at every possible opportunity. She now has anti-biotic eye drops, which seem to be doing the trick, but&nbsp; are increasingly hard to administer. The first ones were easy: Sy did not object, because she could not believe I was really dropping stuff in her eye - when it was already sore as well! She was pretty wriggly the second time, and then we settled down to serious fight back. At Home Daughter&nbsp;is no help, retreating at the first scratch, leaving me to immobilise the cat in general, hold the front paws, hold her head still, hold her eye open, and still have a hand left over to squeeze the very rigid eyedrop bottle. And yet I am succeeding, and her eye is looking much better! Poor Sy. She has just turned 15, and she does not need this kind of thing.<br /><br />I like the sunny weather, though."

"event","I'm still mulling over MaEternal, so I suppose it's doing it's job. There is a review of it <a href=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/maeternalL-rev.htm>Here</a> Eight professional dancers plus eleven pregnant women is a lot of pregnant women! It must have been a very remarkable experience for the women: my friends daughter was thrilled to be part of it, so good on them for that!. <br /><br />It was all dimly lit, and they all wore the same washed out colours, no doubt to make it dream-like, since the two male dancers were the Sandmen. It also drained the individuality out of them all, too, which I was not happy about. It is too easy to loose your ""self"" when you are pregnant, and this seemed to enhance the whole turning-into-a-cypher-syndrome, leaving them hard to tell appart. <br /><br />It was slow and deliberately paced, almost zombie-like (without the outstretched arms and dangly wrists, of course) and lots of the pictures it created were striking: a big heap of pregnant women sprawled across the stage was like an Escher drawing in the way they fitted together, all draped over each other. And a heap of pregnant women is a disturbing image in itself, frankly. <br /><br />But - there is always a ""but"" - the professional dancers doing headstands in toilets, while certainly a clear indicator of morning sickness, seemed too close to accidental parody. As was the dancer getting up from sitting on the loo and shuffling across the stage with her pants round her ankles. What was that about? One of the reviews seemed to think it was deliberate humour, but to me it just looked like ""contemporary dance"", in the bad meaning of the words. <br /><br />Pregnant women can be cheerfully raucous, or tantrumy, or <i>all</i> sorts. This seemed to have taken all the colour and liveliness away. <br /><br />On balance, I didn't like it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Got up 20 minutes earlier than usual this morning and <em>still</em>&nbsp; only got to work at&nbsp;roughly the&nbsp;normal time. Doh! I did nothing more than I always do: fed cats, cleaned cat trays, tripped over cats, yelled at Spider for biting Siam, drank half my coffee and ran out. So how come it took 20 minutes longer than usual?<br /><br />I wanted to get in early so I could get <em>out </em>early, to go with a friend to see her very pregnant daughter in a contemporary dance performance at the Northern Stage...Called ""MaEternal"" it&nbsp;is about&nbsp; ""...exploring the life within, as a group of expectant mothers take the stage alongside the balletLORENT dancers..."" I keep telling myself it will be fascinating, but it just sounds too bizarre for words.<br /><br />It is my bellydance night, too, and I'm feeling really grudging and small-minded about the pregnant dancers, which is mean of me, but dancing has been good the last couple of weeks. The teacher has finally stopped doing the vile ""Stick Dance"", and it looks like we can all move on.<br /><br />I HATE the Stick Dance. It involves dancing, with a stick. You take your stick by the two ends and hold it horizontally in front of you, and dance. Ha! I can't do a proper sinuous camel because all my mind is on my stick, and I look like a drowning woman clutching genteelly at a straw. ""The stick will move naturally with your body"" says the teacher. ""<em>No</em>! It <em>Won't!""&nbsp;<br /><br /></em>Anyway, prancing round a stick reminds me of Charlie Chaplin, ""loveable clown"" with extra helpings of pathos. Eeuch! He may be sad at heart, but that is NOT my idea of funny. I prefer proper humour, like the classic Glasgow shipyard joke, where the bloke on the ship waits for the next man to climed the ladder to the work point, and as his fingers appear, gripping the side to pull himself up, the first man thwacks him on the knuckles with a hammer, and then everyone waits to see if he falls off! Hilarious!. May (or may not) be apocryphal, but it's bloody funny. You can see why Scotland invented the Beano.<br /><br />Anyway, pregnant dancers here I come!"

"event","Well, five weeks into re-training. Yukk. It's every bit as boring yet complicatedly fiddly as I'd feared. I am going home every night shattered and cross. And the state the work comes in in! The last time I did this job, fifteen years ago, solicitors lodged stuff fairly tidily and nicely typed. Now lots of it comes in hand written, apparently by spiders who are unfamiliar with the whole ""writing"" concept. My theory is that with the arrival of the computer all the solicitors joyously&nbsp;threw away their type writers, but - eeek! - never actually learnt to use the scary computer. So they have had to go backwards in time, to the biro. Thank the lord they fought off the allure of the dip-pen!

Cheered up by seeing&nbsp;Magnum last week, though. They are so consistently good on stage. I love them.&nbsp; This time they did ""Don't Wake the Lion"", which I've not heard them do live before -&nbsp;it's so immensly long. It was fantastic. And Bob is so cute!

"event","&nbsp;Bloody mattresses, and bloody Argos.<br /><br />On Thursday the collecting man came for the mattress. It was the same man as delivered it. He was still very jolly, and pointed out that he had been the delivery man, and had a good laugh. I signed the collection paperwork. It did not look like a credit note, so I queried this: he assured me it worked as a credit note also. He said I needed to give it 24 hours for it to be recorded at the depot that it had been returned, still wrapped, and in good nick, and then I could go down to the shop, they'd check everything was ok, I could order the right mattress, pay the difference, and Bob's your uncle. Hooray! Easy!<br /><br />So I went down today, and was told that Argos did not give credit notes. At all. Ever. My paperwork was <em>not </em>a credit note, and the girl on the phone who had originally told me that was what she would arrange could not have said that. I was getting a refund, which would take about 7 days to process - by which I guessed she meant 7 <em>working </em>days. I could buy the right mattress, but I would have to pay the full price, and wait for the refund to appear. Or I could wait for the refund and <em>then </em>buy the mattress. I got the impression she did not much care either way.<br /><br />I'm thrown. The credit note was the girl on the phones own&nbsp;suggestion. She said since I still wanted a mattress, but it was a bit more money, the easiest and quickest&nbsp;way was a credit note rather than a refund, and pay the difference when I ordered it. It had seemed so reasonable. I had been impressed.<br /><br />I'm obviously not buying another one right&nbsp;now, not without knowing if the refund is going to arrive. And I can't believe TWO people independently acted like credit notes were normal, and then the shop denied their existence totally. What gives? It's not hard to know if your company does credit notes or not. Come to that, most companies would <em>rather </em>give a credit note than a refund.&nbsp;Who is right? Will a refund actually show up, or does some part of Argos still think I have a credit note?<br /><br />I am thoroughly fed up.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />"

"event","&nbsp;After Gogol Bordello, Nightwish. As with Gogol, I'd never seen them before. They were hugely popular if the size of the crowd was anything to go by, although lots of people may just have been curious about their new singer. 

The Gogol crowd was pleasantly mixed, both in style and age. The core was grungey students, all baggy jumpers in the kinds of depressing colours that you see in toddlers paintings once they've done a lot of mixing (ie: sludge brown), but there was a good sprinkling of goths and punks, and a lovely blue Mohican, and lots of much older people. Nightwish, on the other hand, was pretty full-on goth, as you would expect, though again with a fair few much older people. It was quite dressy. I'm glad I made an extra effort, though my skirt got covered in spilt&nbsp;beer over the course of the evening. Thank God lace is machine washable these days!

The new Nightwish singer, on the other hand, had made no such effort. Grey trousers and a black tshirt. Not what you want from a band like that with a strong gothy personality. It would not have mattered so much if her singing had been up to it, but sadly it was not. She had a small voice that could not hold it's own against the huge driving sound of the band. She did not catch and hold your attention. She was just not big enough in voice or looks or personality to avoid being overwhelmed by the rest of the band. Sad. 

Their lighting was fabulous, lots of purple, and moody blues, and the music was great. But on the whole, a disappointment. 

We had a problem getting home. The late train turned out to have been abolished since we last needed it. We thought it would be OK because we could get the late bus (as we'd done often enough before). It turns out that has just been abolished too. O bad! So we were stuck till the 4.20 train, and spent the hours hunched in embarrassment in the all-night cafe, surrounded by foreign-speaking taxi drivers,&nbsp;trying to make cheesey chips and coffee last for an eternity - or so it felt. 

Hah."

"event","Began the week with a shock. I was woken up by a noise - not loud, but so full of wrongness that ancient reactions sat me upright with my eyes open and pointing before I was actually awake, ready to spot the sabre-toothed tiger and run for my life. What I saw was the falling curtain pole and curtains as they bounced off the top of the dressing table mirror, and something small and black and hairy with madly flailing limbs just being catapulted off into the air. She thumped onto the ground and was away on her toes out of the room as the curtain pole settled and before I had completed my traditional cry of&nbsp; ""<em>Bloody </em>Spider!!!""&nbsp;<br /><br />I suspect that she is not, by nature, a house cat, though she has never been anything else. She should&nbsp;really be on a farm, and living an exciting and full (but probably quite <em>short</em>) life. Instead she is stuck with me,&nbsp;living a life curtailed by Health and Safety and considerations of Civilized Society. Bad luck her!<br /><br />Finished the week with Siam being sick in my slippers. Ho Hum.<br /><br />I bought a mattress, and it was delivered at the end of the week. At Home Daughter had indicated that&nbsp;some of my aches and tiredness might be down to sleeping on a 25 year old mattress, with lumpy bits where the springs were going, and a couple of spikey bits where they had actually <em>gone.</em> It had never crossed my mind that the mattress was very old and pointless, but once it was suggested&nbsp;it seemed a sensible theory. I bought a new one, and arranged delivery for the mid day slot, 10.00 - 2.00, and a day off work.<br /><br />The door bell rang and rang at 7.00am. I staggered downstairs with my Russell Brand hair and peered out, and it was the mattress, with an unfeasibly jolly delivery man. Maybe he had not been jolly before he saw my hair and loud pink-and-red check pyjamas and bleary little face, but he was offensivly cheerful as he thrust the delivery note into my hand, said ""Sign there"" and bounced off to the van. I signed there, and he reappeared with the mattress. It took me a monent to get to grips - it looked awfully small, but&nbsp;I was still nearly asleep. It was small. It was a single, and I had bought a double. Mr. Cheerfull would not take it away. He only <em>delivered, </em>he&nbsp;was not programmed to <em>remove</em>.<br /><br />So I had to phone the order people, and in the meantime I looked at my receipt from the shop. I had indeed ordered a single. I remember wondering why the price was not what I had expected&nbsp; while I was paying ... So I had to phone the order people and explain that while they were totally correct, I was a complete pratt. I managed to conclusively prove this to the girl on the phone by carefully reading out her own phone number when she asked me for the order number. She was very kind about it.<br /><br />They will send a taking-away man next week. (so that's another days leave) and give me a credit note, so I can go back to the shop and try again. In the meantime&nbsp; we have to sidle down the hall sideways, because it is full of mattress.<br /><br />I had been really looking forward to a nice mattress now the idea has been presented to me. I am depressed about this.<br /><br />On the up side of the same day, we went to see GOGOL BORDELLO. Wow! They are fabulous! I had seen them on the telly, at Glastonbury, but that gave <em>no</em> idea of&nbsp;their immense&nbsp;energy and enthusiasm. Any man who can go through half a song while hopping on one leg, or indeed go quite a ways hopping on one leg <em>while squatting down </em>is my hero! He has the knees of a frog! And a harsh aggressive voice that you would not want to&nbsp;meet down a dark alley. And the charisma of something very charismatic indeed.<br /><br />They had strange dancing girls, who were fully clothed!&nbsp;Maybe Eugene Hutz felt he didn't want his audience to be distracted from looking at him. A sensible decision, though he need not have worried&nbsp;I think.<br /><br />They did&nbsp; ""Start Wearing Purple"", obviously,&nbsp;which sent the venue mad, but they did not do my favourite, ""Immigrant Punk"".&nbsp; Otherwise, a perfect gig.<br />&nbsp;"

At work I have lunch at my desk, and eat, and play on the internet. I fairly frequently get disturbed by colleagues who have got a caller with a question where they are unsure of the answer, and want another opinion... If I have remembered the mp3 player, and am sitting over my Pot Noodles with the earphones in, people approach, and as I look up, they say ""O!"", make a sort of flappy gesture towards their ears, pantomome an apology, and go away. 

Why is it so unacceptable to disturb an earphone-listener? Nobody minds disturbing me&nbsp;if I am in the middle of reading something, after all. &nbsp;I'm quite pleased, but I really don't understand. 

It'll all be in the past soon anyway. Off to training next month. And we have had a formal meeting with the training organiser, and we are now NOT to be taught computer mapping at all. We are going to&nbsp;get a refresher on the job I did years ago, which makes watching paint dry seem a happy and productuve occupation by comparison, and then go off to do it.. The ONLY positive thing had been the interest of learning computer mapping. I am so fed up."

"event","Well, that's Xmas over.&nbsp; Now nothing for it but to trudge through weeks of dark and cold and wet and dreary, with&nbsp;zilch to cheer things along.<br /><br />I took the tree down this evening. I know it came out of it's box, because it was me that took it out, but it certainly didn't fit back in happily. I've got it crammed back by brute force, but the box is bulging and won't shut properly. Also the fairy&nbsp;lights won't coil down sensibly.&nbsp;<br /><br />It looks bleak with the tree gone. It was so pretty, with the dark branches and the green (or blue, according to other members of the family) lights. Maybe they are what my Dad used to describe as&nbsp;bleeny-grue coloured.<br /><br />Lights are not the same these days. When the kids were small, we would decorate the tree and turn the lights on, and not turn them off again until Twelfth Night, and the turning off marked the end of Xmas. It used to be so magical, getting up early and coming downstairs (to get ready for work, or whatever) and the tree would be glowing softly&nbsp;in the dark sitting room, all shivering with tiny glittery movement as little shifting air currents disturbed the tinsel and the&nbsp;baubles so they reflected the fairy lights. Everything in the room looked different in the fairy light. I used to&nbsp;drink my morning coffee in the sitting room without turning the proper lights on so as not to&nbsp;break the spell.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then, of course, Health and Safety started cautioning against such dangerous behaviour, and it turned out that people who left the fairy lights on overnight got burnt to death, because they were tremendously dangerous, and set fire to&nbsp;peoples houses <em>all&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<em>the time. </em>My families survival was plainly an aberration. One of my (now adult) children is a bit paranoid about safety, and I confess the Public Safety films of the crackling sockets and smoking lights got to me also, so&nbsp;these days&nbsp;we only turn the tree lights on in the evening when there are people home, and turn them off at bedtime, and fairyland is dead.<br /><br />Of course, Spider The Naughty Girl would have made me turn the lights off overnight anyway. This is her second Xmas, and she really enjoyed it. She sort of&nbsp;tried eating the lights, or at least putting them in her mouth. The green (blue) gave her little face a strangely eldritch glow. I thought I was going to have to dispense with lights altogether, which is where I finished up last year, but she only hunted them half heartedly, and got bored quickly. It still seemed a bad idea to leave them on when there was no one to watch her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;"

It started well, at the make-up stage, when I got my eyebrows to match. None of the lop-eyed look that I had for Magnum! I felt pretty smug about that.

It was a small venue with a tiny stage, and the six really quite big blokes were pretty crowded, but they were <em>so</em> good, though I'm sad to say there were wearing more clothes than when I saw them in Glasgow. That time they looked more cave-man than Viking: this time they looked more Viking-y. I bore up well under the disappointment, I think.

It was such a good night. They are a fantastic sing-along band, with the best drinking-and-fighting songs <em>ever</em> (a review of one of their cds on Amazon described them as ""fun metal"" which is pretty accurate) and there is nothing better than singing at the top of your voice with a big bunch of other enthusiasts. They even did the whole dividing the audience in two thing, to do part-singing! For Ra Ra Rasputin, their huge live hit, Warlord Nygaard had one half of us led with the accordian, and the other half led with the electric violin, while he conducted, and roared at whichever side wasn't singing loudly enough. We got on a fair way before the whole audience-full were laughing too hard to carry on, and the band picked it up and took it away. 

Some of the audience had plastic horned Viking helmets, and plastic battle-axes to brandish, which was excellent. I had to make do with the old devils horns. I felt thoroughly deprived.

As we were shuffling out, a bloke asked me if I'd enjoyed it: he said he thought they had  really been working the crowd. He said it a bit sneeringly, like it was a bad thing. Indeed they had been working the crowd, and what a happy, willing crowd we were! They are entertainers: they entertained.

Being a fairly traumatised rescue cat (albeit from eight years ago) she has a real thing about being brushed and tidied, and she would NOT let me near it.

Big Bills solution means that MY solution&nbsp;is to haul her up to the vets to be knocked out and cleaned up. She peed all over the carrier, and arrived wet and smelly, but last time she had nervous diahorrea, and arrived ankle deep in runny poo, so I think the pee is an improvement. 

I arranged for a complete MOT while we were at it, and so she had a tooth scale and polish, as well as a short bum and sides. 

The&nbsp;cost made a trip to Tony &amp; Guys for a hairdo seem cheap, though it still makes the dentist look expensive. 

The bottom of her plume-y tail, her bum, her inner thighs and back legs now all look like she has been attacked by a mad skinhead barber. ""Skinbum!"" we can call her. If we want. 

She came home with two tins of special high protein easy-to-digest food to aid recovery, so this morning I had to give Siam her special food laced with laxative granules, Baldy Bill her special food for recovering from an anaesthetic, and Spider The Bad Girl had to put up with normal breakfast.

"event","I am still feeling pissed-off by some of&nbsp;the reviews of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". So many reviewers compared it unfavourably to the Philip Pullman ""Northern Lights"" trilogy. They like to say that by comparison Rowling is not a ""<em>Good</em>"" writer. Her sentence structure, apparently, is poor. Her descriptions are ""mechanical"".&nbsp;<br /><br />We only know that we are progressing through the year, I read,&nbsp;because she says clunky things like, it was hot and sunny, or, it was cold and snowy. Well pardon me, but isn't that <em>usually </em>how writers demonstrate this? They don't, (as Terry Pratchett has pointed out) have the benefit of a picture of a calendar with the pages fluttering off at high speed ...<br /><br />Rowling&nbsp;has not the minimalist elegance of Jane Austen, but nor is she a Rafael Sabatini (of ""Captain Blood"" fame). Now <em>there</em> is a storyteller of true&nbsp;clunkiness! But still&nbsp;with a good story to tell, nonetheless.<br /><br />I think it's a snob thing, although why the&nbsp;Pullman trilogy&nbsp;gets the vote of the lefty-intellectuals escapes me. All I can think of is that he is very heavy handedly anti-Christian, which is still quite a fashionable soft-left stance. But he is very&nbsp;<em>very</em> heavy handed about it. There is no shading or subtlety&nbsp;at all.&nbsp; I could live with that, but he also seems to have absolutely no warmth, and no&nbsp;affection for his characters.&nbsp;There is just a void at its heart.&nbsp;The characters are there purely to further his ideological points.&nbsp; I'm not saying they are not well drawn: they are, but Pullman has no feelings for them, and it's hard to care for someone regarded by their own author as nothing more than a disposable&nbsp;tool.<br /><br />Rowling is a great storyteller,&nbsp;plus she&nbsp;<em>likes </em>her people. No one can doubt her affection for Arthur Weasley, for example. She has humanity. Pullman has ideology. Ideology without humanity leads to the horrors of&nbsp;ends justifying means, which Rowling is very explicitly against.<br /><br />All through Rowling runs the belief that the good side taking up the methods and weaponry of the evil side - only in order to defeat the evil, of course&nbsp;- diminishes the good. Those who do that are flawed, and become the perpetrators of ongoing&nbsp;injustice. Stan Shunpike, the not-too-bright conductor of the Knight Bus, a harmless individual, threads through the books:&nbsp;Stan is wrongfully arrested and imprisoned, and is not released because that would make&nbsp; the Good side look weak - Guantanamo echoes all&nbsp;through this - and Stan is at the heart of a defining moment in the last book, where Harry refuses to perform any spell that would harm him, even though Stan is trying to kill him, because Stan does not know what he is doing.<br /><br />Rowling is not simplistic: Dolores Umbrage, the most unspeakably vile person, is on the Good side. Sirius is not a""good"" person, either. He treats his house-elf with conscious dislike and&nbsp;unthinking cruelty, although ironically (yes, Rowling can do irony,as well!) it is Sirius who comments on Barty Crouches appalling treatment of the house-elf Winky by saying that to really understand a man, you need to&nbsp;watch how he treats his inferiors. Yes indeed, Sirius.<br /><br />Then we have Snape, a staggering&nbsp;creation of true genius and complexity and tragedy.<br /><br />This whole series is a kind of ongoing detective story, with Snape as it's centre. Is he, or is he not, a double agent / triple agent / goody /&nbsp;baddy: as often as you think you've got him sussed, Rowling tips you the other way.&nbsp;The denouement&nbsp; is truly&nbsp;shocking, and a total surprise.&nbsp;<br /><br />She is popular because she is a fantastic, many-layered&nbsp;story teller, so sucks-boo to the snobs who want to prove they are above ""popular culture"" by slating her.<br /><br />And stuff cold-old Philip Pullman, too."

It's like the Star Trek Prime Directive, that Captain Kirk was constantly violating. Good old Kirk! <br /><br />On the other hand, what are they feeding to the owls?

"event","Birds: Spring: speed bumps. 

I go to work via a very pleasant area of 1930's semis with big gardens and mature trees and shrubs, which at this time of year is all birds and nesting. Until a couple of years ago, spring was carnage. The street I walk down was a rat-run for fast cars, and the number of birds (and hedgehogs) killed every spring was horrible. Blackbirds especially, diving low across the road from one hedge to the other, were squashed.

But Lo! Speed bumps were put in a couple of years ago, and there are fewer cars, and they are slower, and I have not seen one dead bird or hedgehog so far this year. This is not what speed bumps are for, but it is what they <i>do</i>, and they are wonderful.    

A rest from Springwatch over the weekend, though, thank God. Too much birds! You can <i>really</i> see how birds are descended from dinosaurs. There is no possibility of empathy with them. I had a snake when I was a kid: beautiful to the eye and silky to the touch, but no mutual connection of any sort. Same with crocodiles (apologies to the shade of Steve Irwin, but they are just not like us). And birds! Yukk!

I knew intellectually about owls etc and their very horribly practical approach to feeding their children, and I continued to like them, but I was just as happy NOT having ever actually watched the bigger ones eating their little brothers and sisters. Now I have seen it, and I don't feel better for it. Bloody Springwatch.

See; cats, dogs, rats, we can look in the eye and understand. But birds, no. Even though the seagull is the most achingly beautiful thing on Gods earth, and their cry reaches right into the back of the heart, past the layers of civilization, down to the fundamental level where you <i> believe</i> that they are the souls of drowned sailors, crying out from over the edge of the world ... and then, of course, you see the mad psychotic little eyes, and they try to take your thumb off on the off-chance that it might be a chip ... The tension between their absolute beauty and their absolute aggressive lunacy is partly what makes them so attractive, but the bottom line is, they are different from us mammals."

"event","Magnum last week (with the t-shirt ownership still unresolved - though it is EXTREEEMLY small, in spite of being labeled ""L"", so we may both finally have to repudiate it): This week, PIRATES!

Went to see the new film on Friday.

Gosh.

Gosh.

WHAT a complicated storyline. Everybody had their own hidden agenda, everybody seemed to be double or triple crossing everyone else, I kept getting lost - ""Did he <i>know</i> that was going to happen?"" ""What just happened?"" In fact the film rather acknowledged that when someone said (roughly) ""Was that planned? Or does he just make it up as he goes along?"" Exactly.

The solution, obviously, is to go and see it again, which is my plan. It may make more sense. That worked well with the second Pirates.

It was good. I enjoyed it. It had shocks and surprises and laughs and a moment of pure yuk when Davey Jones killed someone. But they TOTALLY wasted the Jack Davenport character. He was <i>so</i> good in Pirates 2, I was looking forward to where they would take him. Nowhere, as it turns out. Bug. On the other hand, they did manage to make Orlando Bloom look surprisingly sexy for a minute, with longer hair and a black shirt - but they quickly sorted <i>that</i> out, and he was back in unsexy white by the next scene.

Happily, Voodoo Woman had lots more to do: I <i>love</i> her accent (Jamaican?) plus she had a very fantastic dress, which annoyingly, the camera never lingered on in full length shots.

Jack Sparrow was wonderful, as is correct, but I think that, given the freedom to make him as weird as they wanted, they veered a tiny bit too far off course? Maybe? Mmmm?

Good, though.

Appart from the ending, which was total unsatisfactory rubbish, and also implausable even for fantasy. Really. 

One of the audience on Friday was wearing a skull and crossbones head scarf tied round her head, and a pair of gauzy fairy wings - Ideal. Top thinking. Well done her."

"event","Been to see Magnum. Oh Wow. 

It's months since I've been out, and I've been looking forward to this. At Home Daughter was in a foul mood while we were getting ready - she's put on a bit of weight and her preferred going-out-tops wouldn't fit right, and her lipstick went on wrong. I trotted about trying to be chirpy yet nonchalant, and annoyed the hell out of her, though she was cheered when she realised I had messed up my eyebrows. They are naturally pale and sparse so I penciled them in a bit at the last minute and got them uneven. At Home pronounced, accurately, that I looked ""lop eyed"", and seemed to feel better. 

We were still a bit tense on the train: whenever I try not to annoy her, it annoys her. I was wearing all my really big fancy-twiddly silver and pewter rings and carelessly managed to fasten my hands together. It seemed best not to draw her attention to this, and I had a bit of a struggle to unhook them discretely. 

We got to the venue just before Magnum started (missed the support band), and from then on everything was great. 

Magnum were SO GOOD! I love them: and little Bob Catley (cutest man in rock! Awww...!) was so obviously so delighted to be there and to be adored. He loves performing, and the audience (a big one) loved him. It was all very satisfactory. 

It was very striking how little they had by way of a stage set. (Compare with, for example, equally old rockers Motley Crue, on their tour: lots of dancers, and pyro, but they were <em>not as good! </em>) Magnum just had an off-white backdrop, and had put all their budget into the lighting, which was pretty damn good, and unlike Lordi's lighting and pyro effects, was sharply synchronised with the music. Magnum really didn't need any help from their stage set. They were just fantastic. Bob is such a good, charismatic frontman, and their songs are huge and great. 

""How far Jerusalem"", Kingdom of Madness"", ""Vigilantae""... all the old belters...I LOVE ""Vigilantae"". Singing that at the top of my voice with a couple of thousand other people was the best. SO much better than singing it on my own in the kitchen!!

I had to use my ""gesture clapping"" technique. I have, in the past, clapped my rings out of shape, flattened the backs completely, and needed to get them reshaped, by applauding too enthusistically. Now I cunningly slightly cup my hands so only the heel and finger tips touch. It makes no noise, but if I do really big clapping gestures high above my head, in a big audience it works a treat. 

There is a review of the night here: http://www.themayfairmallzine.com/gigrev/magnum07.html 

The BEST night. Topped off by a merchandising argument. I had not really brought t-shirt money, because on their last tour (the reunion one) the t-shirt design had been crap. This time, though, they had a rather nice girly tee, and I wanted one, and At Home, who normally looks with rather patronising kindness on my love of tasteless, offensive rock'n'metal  t-shirts, also wanted one. I had just enough money on me for one, so we now face a big ""whose tee is it"" issue.

You know when you stir up the ashes of yesterdays bonfire with a stick, and accidentally breathe in through your mouth? Like that. Yukk.

(We <em>were </em>kids!) Certainly, I wore glasses, but responding mainly to the sentiment, and also to the fact that she was bigger than me and quite heavily built (I was a skinny piece) and had lank hair, and was therefore aesthetically annoying, I used to attack her, and hit her and hit her and hit her every time she came with the ""specky four eyes"" chant. She hit me too. She didn't like me, either.<br /><br />She and I (aged 10 or 11) were thrown out of the local cinema once, for fighting, and we carried on in the street, rolling on the pavement and tearing at each others hair, with the rest of the gang in a circle round us cheering indiscriminately, until one of them spotted a policeman coming and we all upped and scarpered ...

(Why does everything always happen on a dancing night?)<br /><br />There were supposed to be four speakers, a Buddhist, a Christian, a Jew and a Sufi. The Sufi couldn't make it. &nbsp;Apparently he'd been to the dentist and couldn't talk, poor man. So they got a second, emergency Buddhist. (<em>That's </em>not something you can say every day, ""We had to get in an emergency Buddhist."") So we had a Mahayana <em>and </em>a Zen, which was interesting as a comparison. Both Buddhists talked about meditation techniques: too much so, at the expense of the mystic / spiritual stuff, I thought. The Zen trotted out the old ""sound of one hand clapping"", which unfortunately took me instantly to Terry Pratchett and Death - ""The sound of one hand clapping is 'CLA' "".&nbsp;<br /><br />I <em>Know</em> the point of the clapping thing, but I think I am irredeemably frivolous.<br /><br />They only had 20 minutes each, which was not ideal. The Jewish woman, who started a bit boringly, was just hitting her stride and getting lively when her time was up, which was a shame. I'd mainly been looking forward to the Sufi as being the one I knew least about, (and because I believe they have a tradition of teaching through humour. Yay!) &nbsp;but I turned out to be pretty ignorant on the Jewish front, too. She mostly talked about mysticism, and a thing called the Sefirotic Tree, but barely had time to scratch the surface.<br /><br />So much to read up on! So little time!

A pane at the top has been cracked for a while, and I had been carefully ignoring it. Then it shifted, and a big triangular shard of glass, still attached at the bottom, leaned out into the room. I was concerned: Spider is still spending far too much time at the top of the curtains, prodding stuff,and swinging and dangling, and using the glass to push herself off, so it needed fixing fast. 

Here we have it: I needed the ladder to reach this top pane. All the panes looked the same to me, so instead of lugging the ladder all the way upstairs, measuring, and struggling it back down again, I rather cunningly measured one of the accessible lower panes. 

There is no glass-buying place near. At Home Daughter suggested that perspex would do the job. Well done her! That's the kind of thinking I like! 

A colleague at work gave me a lift to the DIY shop at lunchtime. I thought they'd cut the perspex for me. He thought they would not. He was right. I had to buy a big sheet. He also helpfully told me that perspex is prone to splitting, and last time he tried cutting any, it all split and broke... 

I'm glad he warned me. I transferred my measurements to the perspex sheet, and cut&nbsp; VERY CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY. It was a pig of a job. It took ages. It did split at one point, but away from the part I wanted, fortunately, and I got the pane cut ok. I tried it against the window, and by God it fitted beautifully! Measurements and cutting were spot on!! Hooray! 

So I trotted downstairs, heaved the ladder upstairs, sorted the removal of the broken glass, put in some wood battening to hold the new pane, put the pane in place and ... 

TOO SMALL!&nbsp; AARGH! 

The battening was enough to deal with the shortfall in height, but with the perspex fixed&nbsp;on the battening on the left hand side, it&nbsp;was shy of the right hand battening by a centimeter or so.

It was so late in the evening by then, I just fixed it like that, with the gap.

That was Tuesday. The need to start again, and try and cut a new pane hangs over me."

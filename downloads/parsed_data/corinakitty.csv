"event","Today is one of those days when I feel like I'm disappearing...like just another few days and I'll be like Patrick Swayze in Ghost, where only a few people can see me, and I can't do anything on my own to make an impact of any sort.
I know it's ridiculous, and it's probably just an over-complicated form of depression, but I keep having to remind myself that not everyone hates me, I do matter to a few people, someone would be sad if I died...yeah...I just keep reminding myself that I actually kind of matter a little bit. Not hugely, but enough that people would probably notice if I disappeared and few of them would actually care. I haven't totally convinced myself of this. I DO convince myself, but then a few minutes later I feel that way again, then I tell myself again that I'm okay, then five minutes later I'm miserable and lonely again. It's ridiculous. Seriously. I need to just plain get over it, but for some reason that's not going too well. Can it just be 5pm so I can at least be miserable someplace other than work?"

In other news, I have gone to the gym, and otherwise been getting a bit of exercise.  I got my hair cut and colored.  I got new glasses (I need to pick them up later this week.)  I actually went grocery shopping for the next several weeks.  (Can't even remember the last time I did that.  Ususally we eat out or order pizza or I pick up a few things at the store on the way home to cook.)  Oh, and we got rid of the cat.  =(  I guess cats just don't like Ken, because I never had a problem with them until now, but this was the second one we had that decided after a month of being well-behaved and litter-trained that it would just go whereever it wanted in the house.  I tried all the suggestions on the internet for re-training her, but it just wasn't working.  Oh well.  I didn't let myself get too attached, just in case this happened.  Good call on my part, I guess."

"event","Things that rock today:
- Today is my birthday. 
- My mom is out of ICU and in a regular room.  She can sit up, talk and walk a little bit.  She doesn't really seem depressed, and she's not mad at me.  They are talking about letting her go home TOMORROW.  Everyone at the hospital is stunned at the speedy recovery she's making.  YAY!!!
- I'm having a pretty good hair day.
- Blair is back to visit for a week from his little Army stint in the desert.
- Going to a crab feed with Ken's parents tomorrow night.  I love events ending in the word ""feed""!
- Timesheets software at work is being updated, so I don't have to use it for a little while.  That shit unnerves me.  It's nice to not have it running for a bit. 
- I got a nice little honey-almond bath junk set from one of my coworkers. I like Birthday Plunder!
- I'm working on reviewing quizzes at work.  In addition to some of those being hilarious, the page takes forever to load, so I have time to do dumb stuff like update my Livejournal!
- Live365 internet radio is playing the fun remix of Boulevard of Broken Dreams that mixes in Wonderwall by Oasis, which amuses me.

Things that suck today:
- My mom is still in the hospital.  She has an antibiotic-resistant infection in her lungs.  She also has some kind of staph infectiony thingy in her lungs that's contagious.  It doesn't really do anything to healthy people, but they don't want anyone who visits her getting her germs and spreading them to other people in the hospital who's immune systems might already be compromised.  Sooo, to visit Mom, we have to put on gowns, gloves and masks.  This gets pretty toasty, which sucks because with my allergies I cough, and when I have a cough, it's always worse when I get overheated.  
- The new Invader Zim shirt I've been planning on wearing -all week- is too big.  Really too big.  I got it big on purpose, because our dryer shrinks stuff, but I didn't get around to washing it, so it's not shrunk.  So, I'm wearing one of my other Invader Zim shirts, but I was a little diappointed.
- Ken woke me up late.  His intentions were good.  He was trying to be nice and let me sleep in.  This just kinda threw off my morning schedule, and I was just slow to get moving anyway.  I also had a nightmare, which waking up on time might have spared me from.  I dunno.  I was trying to kill my uncle in the dream.  That doesn't bother me, cause he's a dick.  It just sucks because it was really hard.  I kept trying to bash his head in with a hammer, and that wasn't doing anything.  Then I was going to stab him with a broken beer bottle, but it took, like, five tries to get the damn bottle to break.  I won.  Stabbed him in the back with the bottle.  It was a pain in the ass, though.
- Pollen count is over 500 again.  I'm feeling pretty crappy.  I'd really like my allergies to go away now.  I've been a coughing, dripping, stuffy, headachey mess all week.
- Stupid Albertsons didn't have the cigarettes I wanted.  Somehow, while running late, I ended up leaving there with soft-pack 100's, instead of hard-pack regulars.  Little annoyance there.  I'm going to try to quit smoking again at the end of the month, so I won't let cigarette malfunctions get to me.  

So, there are a few little stupid annoyances in my day, but it's basically been the best day I've had in weeks.  I'm a happy kid."

"event","Okay, so for anyone who's interested and hasn't been keeping track, here's how my springtime is going:

March 7th: My 14-year-old brother Juan died of pancreatitis.  Corina gets to hang out with the corpse, waiting for the coroner.  Mom is a wreck, so Ken and Corina have to take care of every-fucking-thing with the funeral arrangements and such.  Corina feels guilty for being a shitty sister.  But life must go on...
March 23: My brother's birthday--Mom takes an overdose of pills, we call paramedics.  Northern Nevada Medical Center declares she is fine and sends her home.  She is adamant that the 16 sedatives she took were not so she could die, but so that she could ""visit Purgatory"" and ""People die and come back all the time and I just wanted to check on Juan"".  Corina gets to deal with cops, paramedics, a loopy-drugged mom who doesn't want to go to the hospital, and then a doctor who is way too flippant considering the circumstances.
First week of April:  Mom goes into West Hills - psychiatric hospital.  Corina gets a week off from worrying every second about whether Mom is dead, but has to run errands for the family, who live on the other side of town, take the 12-year-old brother to his band concert and repeatedly deliver contraband such as Pepsi and cigarettes to the funny farm to keep Mom happy.  Mom is released after a week, and is still totally miserable.  
2nd and 3rd week of April:  At some point, Ken's best friend, Al ends up in ICU in piss-poor shape with a mystery lung-tastrophe.  Much time is spent cleaning Al's apartment, doing Al's laundry and trying not to burden Ken in any way.  Via a message from Reuel on MySpace, Corina finds out that Seth, of the infamous Corina's Livejournal ""Seth-isms"" died of a heart-attack.  Icing on the cake.  But wait, there's more...  Mom is still morbidly depressed.  Corina gets a really nasty case of bronchitis, complete with 101-degree fever.  Tobias, Corina's stepdad, goes into the hospital the day that Al gets out of the hospital, with some mystery heart condition.  At first we are told that something is wrong with his left ventricle, but 2 days later it is written off as ""stress"" and he is sent home.  While Corina is not too horribly fond of Tobias, his presence and income are more or less necessary to the family, and anything happening to him would be...problematic.  But he's fine and Al pulled through.  
April 25th: Mom is still moderately suicidal and pretty loopy.  She has had six fender-benders in the last 8 weeks or so.  She still talks about wanting to die.  Social Security tells her that they overpaid Juan 3 years ago, so now they're taking 1/4 of Mom's check every month.  Mom has a melt-down.  Corina leaves work to take Mom out to breakfast, which seems to help.  Corina has also repeatedly taken Mom out to eat, gamble, shop, etc. and bought Mom new clothes, books, DVDs and ...just a ton of crap.  If it looks like it'll make Mom feel better, Corina does/buys it, despite the fact that -nothing- really makes Mom happy. 

April 29th: After receiving about a half-dozen phone calls from Jose (the 12-year-old brother) that Mom will not wake up, Corina goes over to investigate.  Mom is breathing, but, in fact, will not wake up.  After much poking and prodding, a very drowsy and confused Mom is dragged out to the couch.  The assumption is that she has accidentally taken too much of one of her pills, but since there are not a noticeable number of pills missing, overdose is not suspected.  Presumably if 16 sedatives didn't do a thing to her, she can sleep off whatever is currently wrong.  Corina is frustrated, but not especially worried when she leaves a sleepy, dopey Mom at 7pm Saturday.
April 30th: Mom won't wake up again.  Paramedics are called.  Mom's oxygen level is at 30, which is ridiculously low.  The ER nurse says she is surprised Mom even made it to the hospital.  The best guess anyone has is that Mom got some kind of lung infection and she was loopy and tired from having too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen.  Of course, Mom wants to be with Juan, so she told Tobias she didn't need to go to the hospital and that she wasn't sick, and no one figured out until she was basically unconscious for two days.  (She'd been sleeping so much from depression that suspicion was not aroused as promptly as it otherwise might have been.)  Since Mom won't regain consciousness, Corina gets to decide that since Mom is only 47 and has two kids still in grade school, that a ventilator is an okay idea.  No extra heroic measures.  She wouldn't want to be a veggie, but if it appears that she will be okay when all is said and done, then please don't kill Mom, thanks. There is mention of ""CAT scan"" and ""Brain Damage"" since Mom had such a ridiculously low oxygen level for God-only-knows-how-long.  Mom is in ICU on a ventilator, possibly brain-damaged.  No one will know if/to what extent Mom has brain damage until she is awake and off the ventilator.  Every time she's awake, she coughs and chokes on the ventilator and her oxygen level dips. Corina would like Mom to get better, but is dreading Mom being able to talk again, as there is a strong possibility (basing this on knowing Mom for 26 years) that even though Corina has been miserable and worried sick and just wants her little brothers to have a Mom for awhile, that Mom will be resentful and pop off with something to the effect of ""God wanted me to be with Juan and you fucked it all up!  You shoulda just let me die!""   This grim prospect is also based on a brief back-and-forth with semi-conscious Mom.  Mom has almost totally been out of it and sedated.  Rarely does she even respond to anything with so much as a hand-squeeze.  Today Mom did the ""come-hither"" gesture.  Corina goes over and tries to take her hand.  Mom gestures to the tube.  Mom has been on a ventilator before and knows damn well what the tube is and what its purpose is. Corina says ""Yeah Mom, they've got ya on the tube.""  Mom nods.  Corina says ""I know you don't like it and it's not very comfortable, but they have to keep it in for awhile.""  Mom emphatically shakes her head No.  Maybe Corina is reading into this too much, but this was the most lucid Mom had been in days, and it seemed pretty clear. Corina is using this as an object lesson on Why Mom Should Have Listened When Corina and Ken Talked To Her About A Living Will Of Some Sort.  If mom wanted to die that much, Mom should have put it on paper.  Corina is not a total bitch, and would let Mom go if she were certain to be a veggie or if she was in truly terrible shape.  Corina might even be willing to let mom die at age 47 if not for the kids.  Corina wants her little brothers to have a mom.   Assuming Mom doesn't somehow die or become broccoli, (They don't keep healthy people in ICU, afterall.), Corina will likely never hear the end of this, and will be made to feel guilty for keeping Mom from being with Juan.  
Corina is truly incredulous that so much bad crap can happen to one family in such a short period of time.  Corina would like a vacation.  ...possibly one with Thorazine.  Corina will not get that vacation.  Corina will keep visiting the hospital, calling the hospital, giving Tobias and the boys rides all over the goddamn place, getting calls from social workers at the hospital asking about ""advance directives"", arguing with REALLY intrusive/nosy bitches at the loan company about why Mom's car payment will be late, and working at her job, which is it's own little puddle of heaven.  Yeah, Corina has pretty fucking well earned a vacation that just ain't comin.  Corina is also not on her anti-depressants, and considering this, is quite proud of how well she's held together.  
Corina is tired and has slated for tomorrow a full day of work and another awesome evening of hanging out in the ICU.  Corina is gonna go shower, eat a cookie and take a valium.

Corina would really like a vacation."

"event","Because we do.  Diva is a terrible bitch and lives with my mom because she hates us and peed on, like, everything I own.  The new kitty is named Penny.  The name is meant to be funny, since Diva cost hundreds of dollars with no shots, spay or anything, and she needed fancy food and litter and was just...well, a diva.  Penny is cheap.  She pretty much refuses to play with normal cat toys, and only plays with garbage.  Whatever she finds on the floor is fair game and will keep her entertained for hours, but she basically ignores anything that appears to be an actual, intentional, cat toy.  She eats Meow Mix and has a regular litter box full of regular litter (no more damn woodchips).  We've had her for almost 3 weeks, and she's just lovely.  She's affectionate, playful, well-behaved and hasn't destroyed a single thing in the house.  I'll post a pic eventually.  She's tortoise-shell (meaning black with little brown flecks) and calico (splotchy...her little feet are white, she has some white and kinda copper-color spots on her chest and face and one copper colored ear and a little white ring around the tip of her tail.   BIG green eyes.) 
My mom is still pretty pitiful.  She spent the last week of March in the funny farm, and I don't really know how much good it did.  She's still pretty continually miserable, which isn't too much different from before my brother died, just worse now because she has more negative things to dwell on.  My stepdad was in the hospital for a couple of days because his heart was doing something funky.  At first they said his left ventricle had stopped working.  Then they changed their minds and decided that it was just stress and he was fine.  Whatever.   I don't really like my stepdad, but my mom kinda needs him financially, and my youngest brother, Daniel, is REALLY attached to him.  Thus, it would be problematic if he were to die, so I'm basically pleased that he didn't.
We're having Don and Nancy (Nancy is one of Ken's coworkers-nice older lady who threw our wedding shower) over for hot oil fondue tomorrow.  Still need to make plans to do that with Jon and his wife.  I've just been busy, lazy, sick or depressed (which equals lazy) lately.  I'm kinda getting over it all now.  I've been spending a few hours a week working from home to kinda get myself ahead on some big (boring) projects I'm working on.  It's nice to go into work and realize that 1/5 of the work you were going to have to try to cram into your day, you already did the night before.  Also might help make me look dedicated or something.  Raise/bonus is in June/Julyish.  I'd like them to feel good about giving me more money.  
I also got a gym membership today.  Haven't been to the gym since October...and it shows...and it ain't pretty.  So, I'm sorta having one of those ""Today is the First Day of the Rest of Your Life"" kinda things.  Spring-cleaning my life.  On the current short-term agenda: Bed."

"event","If anyone would like to contribute money, my mom won't be getting a social security check for Juan anymore and they will be lowering her food stamps and stuff, so things will be a bit tighter for her financially now.  Checks can be made out to Otha Reyes
PO Box 310
Sparks, NV
89432

I know it seems impersonal to just send money, but she's running out of room in the fridge for food, cause everyone keeps sending cassaroles and stuff, and I hate for her to be worrying about finances when she already has all this to worry about.  I guess people at my job are taking up a collection, which is awesome, because Ken and I are paying for all the deathy stuff.  His parents gave us the money for the service (Can you believe preists fucking charge for that?!  What about their vow of poverty?)  But Ken and I are covering the $600 for the cremation.  I'm REALLY hoping that my brother's Medicaid covers the hospital costs.  I can't imagine what it would be like for my mom to open up a several-thousand dollar bill for the cost of letting her fourteen year old son die.  I know they did all they could, but she's still having a really hard time with that, and keeps asking what else they could have done, and why they stopped CPR after <i> only twenty minutes </i>.  I've told her about fifty times now that 20 minutes is an obscenely long time to do CPR, but it's her kid, so she feels like they just should have done it until it worked.  
Since Juan had an IQ of about 70, he still acted more like an 8-year-old than a teenager, and my mom really babied him.  She had to make sure he took showers and brushed his teeth, and she had to lay out his clothes for him and just basically take care of him as if he were much younger, so I think that makes it harder, too.  
I'm trying not to get ahead of myself here, but my mom is bipolar and prone to pretty severe depression, and she always said that she was going to kill herself, but didn't because there was no one to take care of Juan, but now that he's gone, and she feels so terrible and guilty, I'm really worried that she'll do something dumb.  I hate that.  It's frustrating and I'm going to feel more than a little personally slighted if she does kill herself.  Just because you kids are self-sufficient doesn't mean that they don't need a mom.  The other two boys are only 10 and 12.  How would it feel for them to know that their mom didn't think they were worth staying around for?  That she didn't want to stick it out so she could see them graduate high school or get married?  She's going to see a shrink tomorrow.  Hopefully that will help.  I'm out of things to say to her.  She just rolls her eyes and says ""yeah, whatever"" to me. So stubborn."

"event","My little brother Juan went into the hospital yesterday afternoon.  We didn't know he was diabetic, but he had a blood sugar level of 2900 when he went in.(300 is considered dangerously high)  While I was there, they got his blood sugar down to 1900, which is still ridiculously high, and found that his pancreas wasn't looking too great.  When they moved him to the ICU at 7pm his color was better, but he was still in and out of consciousness.  I got a call from my stepdad at 1am that Juan had passed away (from the pancreatitis), just two weeks short of his 15th birthday.

I was hoping to find a clever list of what not to say when someone dies, so I don't have to slap anyone for commenting, but I can't seem to find such a list.  Usually when someone I know has a death in the family I say ""that sucks"".  I know that seems flippant, and I don't mean to be insensitive, but it just comes out.  I think I've mostly trained myself to say ""I'm sorry"" instead, but I always feel weird saying it, like it's cliche and it just seems a little insincere, even when I know it's not.  I dunno.  Post what you want, if you want, and if it's truly terrible, I'll just call your ass up at two in the morning and give you a detailed description of what it's like sitting and waiting for the coroner.  It's my livejournal and I'll plague my friends with my misery if I damn well please.<lj-cut text=""Cut here for morbidity and pitifulness--Read at your own risk.""> 

You get to watch your mom cry and beg the corpse on the table's heart to start again.  Dead bodies are very still.  You don't realize how much someone moves, even just when they're sleeping, until they don't move at all.  When they intubate someone while they're trying to resuscitate them, they put a tube in the throat, and they don't remove it.  The body is getting cold and you're trying to say your goodbyes, and it's hard not to stare at the four inches of bloody tubing sticking out of his mouth. The longer you sit there, the more you can see the blood settling, and the back of the neck, then the ears, then around the eyes all slowly turning purple and bruised-looking.  The eyes don't shut all the way, and the pupils are all big.  When they say ""fixed and dilated"" on medical shows, it doesn't sound too bad, but it's not how someone normally looks, so it's weird.  The body is stiff, even if you just touch the arm or something.  I knew he'd be cold, but I thought maybe it wouldn't be too bad, since he was cold earlier, because his temperature was only 97 degrees when he was still laying there talking to me.  He still felt cold like that, but the flesh was hard.  It feels kind of like really solid muscle feels.  I never thought too much about rigor mortis, so I figured that it was more something you notice when you try to move the body, but even just stroking an arm or cheek that was soft just hours before feels hard.  When the mortician shows up to wheel out the body, you realize you'll never see this person again, ever, and that's weird too.  We're getting him cremated, so maybe it's different if  you have a funeral with the casket and everything. I changed Juan's diapers, fed him, took him to the park, and sat and watched cartoons with him, and now he's just this cold, hard, dead kid on a blood-smeared sheet in the ICU, and he's never again going to play the King Kong game I got him for Christmas, or put my cat in a plastic shopping bag and carry her around the house to show me how much she hates it.  Anyway, that's what I've been up to since I left work at about 3pm yesterday.  I'm mostly holding together pretty well, since Ken and I have been handling all the business with the funeral home and calling Juan's school and stuff.  Ken has been amazing and deserves to be canonized as a saint for all he's done for my family in the past day.  Basically, he makes all the crappy phone calls, and I just sit there and spout names, birthdays, addresses and stuff when he doesn't know.</lj-cut> 
Another fun tidbit:  My grandmother went into a diabetic coma and died, my uncle has come close a few times, and they keep talking about amputating his feet because of the diabetes, my mom has fairly severe diabetes (not on insulin just yet, but that's not necessary as often with type2 diabetes), and now my brother died from it. I'm really not in the damn mood to add that to my list of medical issues that Pacificare won't goddamn pay for, so hopefully I don't have it, and won't get it.  Yet another reason that it's about time to hit the gym and lose the 50 pounds I've packed on since the wedding.  Cold and tired.  Gonna go watch tv.  I need to sleep soon.  I've had a total of about 4 hours of sleep since yesterday.  Also, just to mention it again: Ken is a saint."

No Fair!  Roughly 5 years of smoking, and no major fire+hair catastrophes...only damaged a few pieces of clothing back when I smoked cloves, cuz they spark and little embers ended up on my cleavage area and burnt little tiny holes in my shirts, but that's not really an issue with normal cigarettes.  I'm clumsy, but I do okay with fire, I guess, is my point.  

I have a cold.  I am full of Robitussin.  It makes my stomach hurt.  Having a cold sucks.  
In other news: Jenny had a baby girl last week. I talked to Blair and he's stationed just outside Tikrit and is safe and bored.  Randi got remarried last week.  The members of Astrobat (Bill, Sara and myself) are working on pieces to enter a local gallery show in March.  I still miss my cat and am very bitter about the whole thing, but can't bring myself to go out to my mom's house and visit the cat, because I know I'll just miss her more, and she really is happier with my mom.  I want a new, different, non-leaking cat that doesn't hate me.  Ken refuses to believe such an animal exists.  I should be making about $150 in the next few weeks on commissioned drawings for co-workers.  The Clown wants a Goofy-Tigger thing, The Terrier wants a caricature of George W. Bush, and the office manager (aka The Prego #1) wants a dolphin playing baseball for her nursery.  Also, I believe we will be using our tax return money (a whopping $300-ish) to print up Astrobat tshirts.  Then you will all buy some, 'cause you love me."

"event","Today kinda sucked.  I've been off my pills for about a month now.  I can tell there's a difference.  I get moody and depressed quite a bit easier.  I try not to get too bad, since people have to deal with me, and I really do like being married and don't want to scare Ken away.  He does dishes. 
Today I finally got around to writing a letter to Blair.  He's in the army in Iraq, and I haven't talked to him since around this time in 2004.  I'd called his parents in November and got an address for him.  After I spent over an hour writing a four-page letter, I discovered that I've lost the fucking address.  I really don't want to keep bugging his family if I can avoid it.  I spent almost 2 hours tearing the house apart (here's the thing about not being on my pills), cussing and throwing stuff...albeit, I didn't break anything, and it was more emptying-drawers-by-dumping-or-hurling-contents-to-the-floor, but it was still not exactly the way a person should go about such things.  I don't think it was much more drastic than your average foul-tempered person.  I mean, I basically just acted kinda like Ken does when he's on the phone with Customer Service.  Seriously, he cusses and everything.  Working in a call center for years should have taught him that cussing usually makes people hang up on you and tell everyone around them that if you call they should expect that you are a douchebag with your own little spot reserved in hell.  Not that he doesn't get things accomplished, but it's about the only time he gets really pissed, and that's unfortunate, since it's one of those times when that does the least good.   Ken is actually good-tempered enough that I have to yell and cuss at traffic for him.  I do a good job and it makes me happy.  ""Hey, Asshat!  That's not a fucking turnlane cumbucket!  Seriously, did monkeys teach you to drive?  Did they?!  ...they did.  You know they did.  You were taught to drive by monkeys.  You should be ashamed.""     
So, yeah, I spent the afternoon all pissed, still can't find the address, and was too agitated to finish my To-Do List for the day.  I took a nap, which helped me get into a better mood--kind of a fresh start.  While I was napping I had a dream that I groped a boy and danced topless in church.  It wasn't entirely my idea (the dancing anyway), and seemed like a good idea at the time.  ...as did the hats made from chinese food boxes.  Weird church.  I have weird dreams. 
I guess that's it for now.  I need to check MySpace...that's also on my To-Do List, which I actually have a shot at completing, which pleases me.  I hate feeling like I wasted my weekend."

Up: Got a rather decent price quote for AstroBat tshirts
Down: Al and my mom are both demanding one, which means the extra time and money of finding someplace that will do a single 2x and 3x, as the mountain 'o shirts we're getting only go up to XL.
Down: Dropped the motherfucking shower shampoo-holder rack thing on my damn foot yesterday.  Sore as hell.  
Up:  Was told by my boss that she will try giving a call to our company's Creative Director to see what I'd need to do to switch departments and actually have a job doing what I do best.
Down: Boss is a bit busy/flakey, so I don't expect that to actually happen, and contacting the Creative Dept. recruiter directly was a waste of time and she's a useless toadface who can't read a simple email.  (The recruiter, not my boss.  My boss is pretty keen, usually.)
Up: Three Day Weekend
Down: Overwhelming desire to spend the whole time sleeping. 
Up: Found out that one of the two destination weddings I was supposed to go to this year has been postponed. (This is nice, as I can't really afford two trips to Hawaii in one year.)
Down: My damn nailpolish keeps chipping. 
Down: I miss my cat.  
Down: It snowed, and I hate that. 
Down: I need a scanner...and printer ink.  
Up: Just about everything I've cooked this week has turned out wonderfully, including fish!  I made fish that was neither dry nor puddingy.  I am proud. 
Down: I'm having a hard time concentrating at work.  
Down: I'm worn-out and end up getting nothing done beyond cooking dinner when I get home.  (Despite intending every night to work on art.)
Down: I weaned myself off my antidepressants because I missed an appointment, which means they'll close and need to re-open my file and will need tax info that will show that I am now married and make a lot more than I did before.  Since PacifiCare are fuckers, and I don't actually have the money to pay out-of-pocket for my HappyPills, I've stopped them.  I can feel that I've stopped them.  Part of it is probably PMS, but I've been more moody all week.  I know I'm overreacting to Ken getting rid of the cat.  As mentioned, it's harder to stay focused at work.  I don't wanna do anything when I get home.  I'm more mopey.  My tolerance for people has dropped dramatically and my temper is worse.  
Anyway, I need to go help Ken find lightbulbs, then I need to draw more AstroBats and maybe see what's going on with the MySpace account that I've looked at, like, twice ever."

(Another for-instance: I'm not using red and yellow because in addition to being ugly, it reminds me of McDonald's.)

I have made new and spiffy art in the form of a skateboard deck design.  Go look!  
Also, if anyone would be interested in a Tribal AstroBat tshirt, it looks like enough people like them that I'll actually be getting some printed, so lemme know if you'd be willing to shell out a few bucks for one.  (Probably the standard $15 to $20-ish that any interesting-looking tshirt seems to cost these days.)  I'm not positive on the color scheme, but it'll probably be white on black or maybe white on olive-drab. NOT the black-on-white shown in the picture.  No one wears white tshirts.  I just used white because I'd made the design black, and the purpose was to show off the design.  I didn't even originally necessarily plan on tshirts, but who am I to deny my adoring fans?  =)

I still need to change the damn colors on that page...and apparently the font as well."

AstroBat is currently comprised of <lj user=""king_kaboom"">, <lj user=""hallowmas"">, me, and whatever spills out of our brains and manages to actually get uploaded. As I am told I can tweak the color scheme on that page, I think I will be doing so soon.  It's too...mustard-colored.

So, yeah, I'm actually working on art again.  Thanks to good Christmas presents and a recurring dream that I've already had twice this week where I quit my job to pursue my art career.  Not that I plan on quitting my job, but I figure my subconscious is trying to tell me something, so who am I to ignore it?  Today I went out and got a few trade mags.

In other Corina News: 
(To be honest, this is largely copied out of a long-ass email I sent Jenny.  I'm lazy.)
Pacificare is trying to say my ulcers are a ""pre-existing condition"".  They keep sending me all kinds of bills for stuff that's supposed to be covered and it's costing me hours on the phone and standing around by the fax machine at work.  I'm so pissed.  I haven't gone back to the doctor, haven't gone for any follow-up bloodtests they ordered, and have not refilled my perscription.  I really didn't feel too much different, and as far as I'm concerned, unless it looks like I really might be seriously ill, it's just not worth the trouble to go to the doctor.  
Also on the bad news front:  Diva (the kitten we got) now lives with my mom, who swears to god she won't let the cat out this time.  Ken and I agreed (though I was reluctant) that the couch is the only thing in the apartment that costs more than the cat, and we don't really have $800 to get a new one, so the deal was that if she peed on that, she was out.  She was in the habit of peeing on stuff, not because she wasn't box-trained, but because she had an attitude problem.  She was very strategic about it.  ...she peed inside my fucking leather jacket, for instance.  Anyway, despite my best efforts to tallk him into giving her another chance, Ken declared that he loves our nice furniture a bit more than the kitty (though he was fond of the kitty).  He felt bad getting rid of her.  I bawled my eyes out for two hours.  That sucked, because, as I discovered the next morning, I was coming down with a head cold at the time.  Head Cold + 2-Hour Crying Jag = Bleh.  So, I missed two days of work this week with the head cold.  I've been calling my mom at least once a day to check on the cat and the LoveSac, which the cat peed on, so it also lives at my mom's, since she doesn't mind a little cat pee the way Ken does.  Heh.  Damn LoveSac took up too much room and didn't get used enough lately anyway.  
I got myself a new jacket.  It's not leather, but it's PVC, and looks like leather.  It's not a biker jacket...I guess I've finally outgrown that.  I loved that damn jacket, but it's sooo hard to get the smell of cat whiz out, and it was cheaper to get a new coat than to get the old one dry-cleaned.  
The holidays were good.  Had Christmas Eve dinner with Ken's family, Christmas morning breakfast with Ken's family, and Christmas dinner with my mom.  I spent a retarded amount of money on everyone.  Ken's car stereo was total crap: Somehow all the speakers got blown when his dad took the car to replace the battery when the battery died this past summer, and the cd player skips when it's cold outside.  So, I got Ken a stereo.  I was quite proud.  I talked the guy at Audio Express down from $380 to $250.  Ken is stupidhappy with the stereo.  I got my mom a SpotBot, since she's got her poopy dog and my leaky cat.  I also got her a very nice diamond ring and gold earrings.  Tobias never got her a wedding ring and she's been eyeballing rings and whimpering for several years now.  She's really excited.  I keep expecting her to rear-end someone when she's driving 'cause she's so busy looking at her new Bling.  Heh.  Yeah.  So, since Jose was so totally a good kid this year, I got him a portable DVD player and 4 DVDs (all 3 American Pie movies and Ladder 49, cuz he wants to be a firefighter), as well as some clothes and stuff.  Juan was pretty well-behaved, all things considered, so I got him some clothes and the King Kong game for his GameCube.  Daniel has been a little shithead.  He mouths off, doesn't help with the cooking or cleaning, screws off and gets in fights at school and is just generally a little fucking punk lately, so I got him two pair of jeans and three shirts, and that's it. (Which he was totally okay with until Jose opened the DVD player.)  He cried, so I explained to him why he got shitty presents and that if he was better next year, he'd get better presents.  He accepted the explanation pretty well.  I intend to remind him throughout the year.  Since nothing my mom does keeps him in line, (grounding, spanking, etc.), I'm hoping that bribery in the form of Christmas presents will help reign him in a bit.  
 As for my holiday plunder, the notable things:  I got speakers for my i-pod.  Unfortunately my i-pod ceased to function the week before Christmas, and everyone is still sold out of them.  (Did you notice I'm having a little run of bad luck with the ulcers, the cat, the i-pod and the headcold and all?)  I got a stylus and tablet to make my Photoshop and Illustrator work easier.  This puts a bit more pressure on me to actually produce some damn art (ASTROBAT!), which is technically a good thing, as I've been a major slacker.  I got super-awesome headphones--They're huge and block out sound wonderfully.  I might actually get some work done instead of letting all of my coworkers distract me with talk of balloon animals and peeing on Nick's shoe.  I got a fondue pot and an espresso maker.  I'm hoping the caffeine from the espresso will boost my metabolism so I can burn off some of the fondue calories.  There are probably a few flaws to that plan.  I really need to lose some weight.  I'm back up to 185.  That about 40 pounds more than I weighed for the wedding.  Ugh. But I now I have a really awesome rum cake recipe!"

We got her a big, purple igloo to poop in.  Thus, we are looking at possibly giving her an eskimo name. Although they don't do her justice, because her coloring is nifty and not too apparent in the yellowish lighting, here are pics of her and her igloo:  http://pics.livejournal.com/kenelf/
When she's not under icky yellowish light, her underside is kinda pink and her top is sorta slate blue.  I'm biased, but she really looks neat.  I would sure as hell hope she would--She was expensive and we have to drive up to Truckee to meet the breeder and get her.
Also, if you desire to see our wedding or honeymoon pics, they're in Ken's little livejournal pics thingy too.  More kitty updates to come. I'm blathering on like a new mother.  I'm not having kids, so this is my big thrill in life.  Yesterday she came out of her carrier, ate in front of me and played with her feather.  This is the first time she'd really come out of hiding.  I texted Ken to tell him.  Yeah, I'm lame.
At work, they've been utilizing/abusing my artistic ability.  It's kinda nice.

On the 16th, I get to go in for fun procedures.  On the upside: At least for now they aren't going to cut me open.  The downside: They aren't cutting me open because they intend to take full advantage of my built-in orifices (Yes, <i> orifices </i> -- Plural.) before they decide to give me any new ones.

"event","1.  A sales rep at the Foster City office named Mohammed, who called my boss several times a day all week wanting to know when the project he wanted done would be finished.  He also gave this nice shot-in-the-dark guess as to the size of the site I had to review.  He said 40-60 pages.  It was over 200.  I averaged about 5 hours of sleep per night this week, and my average workday was a bit over 10 hours.  Plus school and homework.  Do the math--it ain't pretty.
2.  Hugh Frazer, the professor for my online English 101 class.  Somehow the man expects a coherent paper with a beginning, middle, and end INCLUDING quotes that directly reference the text.  He's ridiculously into the quotes.  The issue here:  He wants all that to fit into 3 pages - <i> double spaced </i>.  That's including the space taken up by putting my name, his name, the course and the date.  WTF?!  I have to sacrifice a line of text so you can see your own name in print?!  Are you so fucking old and senile that you don't know who you are anymore?  Furthermore, why do you need my name on a separate line when I have to put my last name as the header on the top right of each page anyway?  Just let me add my first name to the header.  The man also assigns about the most boring writing assignments on earth.  Seriously, the last one was:
8-12 sentences - Somehow fitting in examples and details referencing the text...
Topic:  What factors are involved in the sequence of writing a specified process analysis and an informative process analysis?
Feh.
3.  Silvia Rodriguez, my former Spanish teacher.  I dropped the class.  She started off the second class with ""If anyone has work conflicts, this may not be the class for you.""  No shit.  If you miss 3 days, she drops you.  I missed one day due to feeling like ass.  I would have to miss another day for a business trip I'm taking in October.  That leaves 12 weeks where I can't miss a single class.  She's really abrupt, and she teaches the class in spanish, which is kinda okay, except that she always used words we hadn't learned yet, without bothering to tell us what they mean.  Then, she wouldn't spell them and if someone pronounced the word wrong (easy to do when you haven't seen it spelled and just had some crazy woman pack it into a two-minute blabberfest chock full of words you've never heard in your life), she'd basically make them repeat it several times, just to hear how they were fucking it up.  If you have to ask, maybe it would be better to just correct the person, rather than humiliate them.  People really squirmed.  It was horrible to watch.  Anyway, I decided that rather than making myself miserable dealing with that woman and risking losing the full $200 I paid for the class due to her bullshit attendance policy, I'd just drop it now when I could still get half my money back.  I'm soooo happy I did.  Still wanna punch her.  
4.  Marc S., who is one of the publishers we deal with at work.  It's my job to send him lists of things that must be changed on his site.  This is just how it is.  If you are going to place ads for a company, and get paid for doing so, you have to make sure your ads are the way that company wants them.  If McDonald's suddenly decided The Arches should be purple, anyone promoting them would have to change the ""golden"" arches to purple.  If McDonald's was our client, I'd be sending out announcements to anyone we deal with promoting them, saying ""Hey, change this!"".  If the next week, McDonald's decided to take fries off the menu, I'd have to contact everyone again ""Hey, if you're listing McDonald's menu items on your site, take down the fries!"".  If the next week, they decide to change their name to McBloodyDiarrah's, I'm sending out an email.  Now, if you make all the changes right when you're supposed to, we check, see it's done and leave you alone.  We only pester if you consistently mark things ""done"" when they aren't.  Having these sites make the publisher money.  They get paid when people fill out a form to be contacted by one of our client's.  All the publisher has to do is make up a site, and do the edits as needed.  You can make a lot of money sitting on your ass doing virtually no work at all.  Switching out a logo or changing a few words on a few pages isn't that hard.  <b>AND YET</b> I have this fucking message waiting for me in my inbox that does not say that Marc S. has made his edits.  It's a bit whiny bitchfit about how difficult it is to keep up with all the changes, and wanting to know when the client will be done making changes.  Never.  The clients he's promoting are schools.  They are always changing program listings, campus locations and such.  If you don't want to handle your end of things, you must not want your paycheck.  Asshole.  Do your job.  Don't fucking argue with me.  I'm not sending you edits just to piss in your Wheaties.
5.  Elena in payroll.  Spent two days arguing with the office manager and me about my paychecks.  We explained that I'd been switched to salary and given a raise, and yet my checks were for less than my old rate of pay.  Finally, after a lot of email and a conference call, she admitted she'd fucked up, pouted, told her boss we picked on her, and FedExed my motherfucking paycheck.  She also screwed up our office manager's check, and Sean's benefits stuff, if I remember correctly.  She's real good at her job.  

That's it for now.  There are others I'd like to punch, but I've gotta go do laundry and pick up The Husband from the airport, so maybe I'll continue this list another day."

School is okay.  My spanish teacher was a pesky bitch with a ridiculous attendance policy considering I'm the one paying to be there.  Ultimately, I dropped that class.  After my business trip in October, I'd have 12 weeks where I wouldn't be able to miss a single class without the bitch dropping me.  I figured I was better off to just drop the class now and get half my money back than stress myself out and likely end up not getting the credit but losing all the money I paid.  Does that make sense?  Sure it does.  Otherwise, school is tolerable.  So far I'm basically indifferent/slightly annoyed with my online english class.  It's not hard...just annoying.  My design class would be okay if the instructor can just get in the habit of telling us things instead of expecting us to magically read his mind or know where his brain went when it detoured.  He gave us a handout that says thumbnails are small drawings in pencil or marker.  He doesn't specify until two classes later (when half of the class has started pencil thumbnails) that he wants them in marker only.  We have to design a logo involving a star inside a pentagon.  During our first critique, he's incredulous that no one thought to remove the lines that form the outer pentagon.  As long as the entire design in within the pentagon, apparently it doesn't matter if the pentagon itself doesn't have a border...it can basically be invisible.  We didn't know were were allowed to get rid of the lines that actually formed the star and pentagon.  There have been other things, but I think you get the idea.  The class is okay, even if the teacher is insane and incredibly picky about what products we use, so that I had to go drop about a hundred bucks on supplies.  (He wants Art Tape, not masking tape.  He refuses to allow us to use ANY adhesive but Studio Tac.  Feh.)
Work is fine.  I'm now full-time permanent.  All the benefits and a little raise.  Presently I'm working on the most tedious pain in my ass site review ever.  The sales rep keeps calling my boss wanting to know when it'll be done.  It's three times larger than he thought it was.  She said it'll be done tomorrow.  I'm going in early.  I have about 40-60 pages left, and I've suddenly run into pages that are just retardedly long, so doing a single page is taking an hour.  Fucking lame.  
Not much else going on.  Just work and school and decorating the house.  Whoopee."

"event","Not much else going on right now.  Haven't been feeling all that well lately.  We're guessing what's wrong. (I'm not about to shell out a few hundred dollars to go to the doctor unless I truly have to.)  So far, the symptoms I have most closely match those of Shingles.  I'm cool with that being what I have, as there is nothing to be done about it, except wait it out (so I feel justified in not going to the doctor) and it's not really contagious.    
<lj-cut text=""More fun details here"">  The general consensus, however, is that I would be in more pain if it were that.  But as Bill pointed out, my idea of pain is a bit different from everyone else's:  I whine a lot, but I also walked around (working two jobs, no less) for several weeks with my guts in balloon-animal form and a burst ovarian cyst.  So, maybe that's something to consider.  I dunno.  Anyway, I presently have a bit of a blotchy rash sorta thing on my lower back. The blotch is about 1-2 inches across, and comprised of a bunch of little raised bumps that remind me of your average small bug bite.   It looks like another similar spot-o-rash is forming on my right hip. My whole right hip itches like crazy, even though there's just a tiny spot that looks rashy.  Also, both my hips hurt to the touch.  It's not up where the bone is, but more just below there, where you're starting to hit Saddlebag Country.  There's an area about 5""x5"" that feels basically like a bad bruise.  It looks fine, but feels sore.  Finally, I have swelling an tenderness along my groin, kinda where thigh meets torso.  It's too low to be ovaries, and the only thing I can think of that's there is lymph nodes, though it seems odd to me that only the one set would be swollen, and not all of them.</lj-cut> If anyone has a suggestion as to what the hell might be wrong with me, lemme know. 
Work is the same.
On tap for next week:
-School starts
-Appointment at the funnyfarm.  (By the way, what I have is not The Death Rash from the HappyPills.  I already checked.)
-Should become ""full-time"" (permanent) employee
-Ken's vasectomy
-Preparing for the move into the new apartment 
We are moving on the 10th--Krispy Kreme and coffee will be served for all who carry shit.  Our furniture consists of the Lovesac, two bookcases (One tall and one only about chest-height), an office chair, and the TV.  I think that's really it.  All the rest is boxes of our precious junk.  Shouldn't take long to move at all.  Ken is getting a U-Haul.  I have no idea why.  I think things can be moved easily enough just taking advantage of the few people we know with trucks.  Yeah, it would take a couple of trips, but it's less than five minutes away (Literally).  There's only one streetlight between here and there, and you make a right turn at it, so you don't even really have to wait if it's clear.  All of the new furniture is being delivered and assembled by the fabulous folks at Dania.  Since my last post about this, we've purchased the end table to go with the coffee table (which isn't actually as small as I was thinking), the loveseat that matches the couch, an entertainment center (Nothing huge and flashy, really.) and the dresser that goes with the bed.  We're still hunting for a desk.  We found one at Office Depot that was pretty keen, but they made the delivery and set up such a nightmare to plan, that we just opted out.  We might still try to work out the bugs on that plan, and go back to get it.  It was pretty damn nice and BIG, for only about $400.  
So, there's your furniture update.  Try not to get too overexcited.  Oh, we also bought a mattress for the bed.  I need to start looking for purple jersey-knit deep-pocket sheets.  Wish me luck."

It's really red.  It just looks pinkish in this picture.  It's microfiber, which means it's easy to clean, but it feels and looks basically like suede.

We also got this bed, headboard (though not the headboard extensions) and the nightstands--We'll probably get the rest later.

and stuff.  You can kinda see the shower curtain in the background of this pic.  Es bueno.
Not sure what we're doing with the second bathroom.  Something more fun.  Less grown-up.  I liked this bathroom set enough to sacrifice my Spongebob shower curtain, but it's definitely one that Ken chose.  He has good taste.  I am inherently tacky.  I can't help myself.  Anyway, there's your virtual tour of our apartment-to-be.  I'm getting a kitten.  WHOOOOO!"

Meanwhile, back at the ranch...

Ken and I went apartment hunting about 8 months ago.  We found a place we really liked and we asked that if they got any 2 bedroom corner units that they contact us.  Ironic that the same week we start looking at buying a house is the week they call.  I think it's a sign.  
http://www.apartmentguide.com/Property/property.asp?wsv_qsGeoKey=1,34,112&wsv_psPropertyID=4136
We really love the apartment, and it would beat the hell out of anything we can afford to buy, so I think we'll do well to just move into the new apartment, and put off house shopping another year or two until we have some money saved and our credit is a bit more spiffed up.  This is all assuming we can get through the application/credit check for these apartments, though I'm not too worried, really.  If we get in, we'll be moving around the middle of September.  I'm a little excited.  If we don't get it, it's back to looking at condos on Neil Rd.

Oh, and I bowled like shit today.  102, 122, and a 103."

"event","I really haven't bothered in a few weeks.  Not intentional, I've just been either busy or tired.  Job is okay.  I'm told that I may not be made ""permanent"" due to the fact that I'm going back to school.  That sucks.  It basically means that while I may still have the job and the 40 hour weeks and whatnot, I won't get any benefits/paid holidays/vacation time ect.  So excuse the fuck out of me for trying to better myself.  I guess it has to do with my ""flexibility"".  I kinda wish someone would have mentioned this when I started, though I can't say it would've made a difference.  I mean, it's more money than I've ever made, and I never had any of those benefits and perks before, so I guess I'm not really missing out.  Just a bummer.  I was looking forward to paid vacation--I'm going to need it after a year or two of working and going to school.  Bleh.  Whatever.  I'm just not very lucky.  At least it's not phone work, right?
In other news, this evening Ken and I talked to a friend of his who's a realtor.  Apparently we can just about afford a trailer (albeit a decent one) in Sun Valley.  I think we'll be putting off the house-buying for a bit longer.  Again, I'm just not lucky.  Kind of a loser, really.  I shouldn't get too bothered.  I mean, I'm doing just about everything I intended to do.  I'm going back to school. I have a car.  I don't work at Telco.  I'm building a portfolio.  I bagged Ken.  (Yeah, for awhile that was an actual life goal.)  None of the good stuff has happened on the time line I'd planned.  I wanted to be out of Telco months before I was.  I wanted to drive years before I did.  I wanted Ken from the time I was 17.  It's taken me over four years to get back to school.  I guess the whole buying a house thing is just another thing that will happen eventually--Far after when I'd planned it.  Some people never buy a house and I know plenty of people well over a decade older than me that are no closer to buying a house than I am.  I'm too competitive.  A lot of people I know are buying houses right now, and I have to admit, I'm a bit envious.  (Though I think this is evened out by the fact that literally half of my female friends  are pregnant or have just given birth and I don't envy that a damn bit.)  I tend to forget, until Bill or Ken remind me, that I started out with a bit of a disadvantage compared to most people.  I grew up poor.  I was abused.  I ended up dropping out of school.  (Not entirely by choice.)  I'm mentally ill.  (Not a cop-out.  It really did set me back a bit.  Hard to plan ahead when offing yourself is on your Short List.)  There have just been a lot of things have have held me up.  It didn't help that I never really thought most of this stuff was possible.  Things like getting a college degree, buying a house, investing, and having a job that you don't hate that actually pays the bills were foreign to me.  I really didn't think those were feasible things.  I mean, my mom was a waitress until she lost her marbles and had to start collecting SSD because she was too nuts to work.  My dad had a job he hated and barely managed to pay his bills.  Unless one of my cousins has gone, I don't think anyone in my entire family has a college degree.  Neither of my parents even have a savings account.  The other day my little brother asked me if I was rich.  Compared to my mom, I pretty much am.  I don't think I know too many other people who are so much more well-off and successful than their parents.  Doesn't really matter, I suppose.  Moving on...
Here's some good news:
<H1>KEN'S VASECTOMY IS SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 1ST.     WHOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!</H1>

"event","I have now been employed with Quinstreet Media, Inc. for 4 days.  I am a ""temporary"" employee for the first few weeks while they decide if they want to keep me.  My job duties thus far have been fairly simple ones.  Basically, someone has already looked over some websites for mistakes and let the people at the site know what they need to fix. (Typos, logos that are the wrong color, general incorrect information...)  A couple of weeks later, someone has to go back, with a list of all of the things that needed fixing, and check to see if it was actually done.  Sounds easy, huh?  Problem is, you run in to weird shit and new problems that the first person didn't catch, or that have come up since the site was checked previously.  Also, you end up having to look up what is correct to match to the sites.  If there is a long list of programs or services offered at a particular location, and several of them have to be removed, you have to look back and forth between the list of what should be removed, and what's on the site to see if it was done.  When a lot of the things on the list are very similar, it's hard.  
Here, I'll illustrate:

The SquishyHappy Ice Cream Shop - Atlanta, GA no longer carries the following flavors.  Please remove them from your site.
Chocoberry Sugar Cone, Berry-Yummy Crunch,  Banana Waffle Cone, Yellow Yogurt, Chocolate Banana Crunch, Yellow Yogurt Lite, Berrychip Delight, Yellowberry Choco-cone.

You check the site, and have to make sure none of the above appear on this list:
Waffle Choco-cone
Berryyellow Crunch
Banana Chocolate Delight
Yellow Lite Yogurt
Berry-Yummy Sugar Cone
Yellow Banana Waffle Cone
Chocolate Banana Toffee Crunch
Berrychip Delight Lite
Choco-sugar Berry Cone
Yellow Yogurt Delight
Berrywhip Delight
Yellowberry Sugar Choco-cone

Yeah, it doesn't help that when people put their notes in the system, they run everything together on a line, instead of making it a list with each item on it's own line.  Meanwhile, as you're looking this over, you realize that in SquishyHappy Ice Creams guidelines, it says something about the use of the term ""lite"", you have to go look it up, and make sure that the site is allowed to list ""Lite"" items as being available at the Atlanta store, and you can't remember if this is one of the companies that allows the use of the word ""Light"", but not ""Lite"" on their site.  Furthermore, just to find SquishyHappy, you had to search through a list of damn near every ice cream shop in Georgia.  
Fun?  Yeah.  Now sit and do that for eight hours.  
Don't get me wrong, I really do like my job, it just really sounds easier at first than it is.  ""Oh, I proofread web-sites.""  That's not even all we do there.  I just haven't been trained on other things yet.
On the upside, if they keep me, I get full benefits, paid sick days, paid holidays, 401k.  The money is decent.  They spoil their employees rotten.  Today we had a ""meeting"" at The Brew House.  It was an hour and a half.  I only had to write my usual one hour lunch on my time sheet.  I had beer and a cheeseburger at lunch.  The company paid.  Yes, beer.  At lunch.  At work.
On the 19th--21st, we are taking Excel classes (also paid for by Quinstreet), and on the afternoon of the 21st, when we get done with class (early afternoon), we're going horseback riding.  Again, the company is paying.  It's a ""team-building activity"" or some such.  Also, they have the most fully-stocked kitchen ever.  Pop-Tarts, cheese, lunch meat, bread, mustard, coffee, soda, tea, Cup O' Noodle, oatmeal, cereal, cherries, grapes, apples, granola bars, nuts, bagels, cream cheese... You get the idea.  Coworkers are also fun.  Yesterday they caught a beetle, and it was decided this morning that it would be the new Compliance Team Mascot.  I think they finally let it go outside.  One of the girls in the office uses one of those big exercise balls as a chair.  Exclusively.  Didn't see her use a real chair all week.  
Soooo, that's my job.  Feel free to covet.  Then go get ice cream."

whos your best bud? Ken.  (Lame answer, since we're married, but we were best buds first, and it kinda stuck.)
whos your worst enemy? It <i>was</i> Susan at Telco.  I don't know if I have a worst enemy now.  Maybe our kitchen knives.  They hate me and want me dead.
who's your SECRET crush? I'm not allowed to have those anymore.
Whats your biggest secret? Obviously I can't say that here or it wouldn't be a secret.  Eventually I'm sure it will come up, but not for at least a few months.  Not until it's been long enough to no longer matter.
Have you had your first kiss, who was it? This little mexican kid named Tony in my kindergarten class.

Who was the last person you..
(try not to wretch/get bored)
held hands with? Ken

cried about? Probably Justin
sang with? Ken's family--""Happy Birthday"" to his nephew yesterday

Michael Jackson or Madonna? Madonna would win in a fight, and she looks better naked.  Yup, I'm goin' with Madonna.

Lizards or snakes? Lizards.  Green ones.  Like they have all over in Florida.
Birds or fish? Yuck.  No.


For boys:
I'm answering anyway!  *is a rebel*

Perfect Bra size? Anything perky is good.  Somewhere in the 32B-36D area, depending on the girl's build and the perkiness.  I guess the average there would be a 34C.
Blonde or Brunette or Ginger? Trousers?  Jumper?  Ginger?  We're Brittish!!!  Ginger.
Curvy or Stick thin? Curvy, but not like when chunky girls refer to themselves as ""curvy"" when they're just fat.    
Pleasured or Pleasuring? Yes, please.
Your Perfect Girl?: Cross Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mary-Kate Olsen and Drew Barrymore together.  Now, give her red hair, and wax her from the neck down. And make her Bi.  Doesn't do me any good if she doesn't dig chicks.

For girls:

Perfect Dick (In Inches)? Any dick within about 60 inches of me is fine.  Closer is better.

"event","This post will  make me very unpopular with some of you.  You'll get the gist pretty quick and it's your own fault if you continue reading beyond the first line or two.  Most of you know where I stand on this, but I felt the desire to re-affirm things.  I may also print this out and keep it on my person for times like these:  

Pitiful Breeding Simpleton: ""What do you mean, you aren't having kids?!  Why don't you want a baby?  Don't you think you're being selfish?  Children are such a JOY to have around!!!  You'll want one eventually--It's different when it's your own.""
My Stock Answer:  ""Ya know, that sounds awesome, and I'd really love to squirt out a few puppies, but I'm just so busy with all this free time and money I have!""

Alright, kiddies, let's do some math:

Average cost to raise a child from birth to age 18:  $190,000 (The range is about $160,000 to $320,000--I went conservative.)
This is not including the cost of the pregnancy.  (Sonograms and ridiculous maternity dresses with Loony Tunes characters on 'em ain't free, honey.)   
This is also assuming you are not paying for your demon seed to go to college.
Furthermore, this is assuming you only have ONE.  Yes, it <i>is</i> possible to stop at ONE.
Finally, this being an average, if you end up with a child with exceptional needs, you are infinitely more screwed.  Go hang out at the pediatric oncology ward of your local hospital, and while you are observing how much misery goes in to being responsible for another little human's life, try to get a glance at the insurance forms.  Sorry, Little Billy--Daddy won't be here when you get out of surgery.  He's delivering pizzas.  

Okay, so you have a single, healthy child, with no plans beyond high school graduation.  Good job.  Way to spawn a real go-getter.

You will be spending close to a quarter of a million dollars on that kid.  If we go with our original conservative figure of $190,000, you're looking at about $10,555/year.  $879/month.  Think of what you could buy if I gave you a check for $879 each month.  Nicer car, maybe?  Bigger apartment?  How 'bout a vacation, or some new furniture?  

So if you have a kid, you screw yourself out of almost nine-hundred dollars per month for eightteen years.

Let's say you take that same $190,000 and invest it in stocks/mutual funds or some such--rather than investing it in the future of a child who may very well just end up living under the bridge downtown, trading blowjobs for crack.
 
Our friendly Digital Federal Credit Union tells us the following:
If we deposit <i>absolutely nothing additional</i> each month after we put in our $190,000
After 18 years, at a steady not-all-that-fabulous-interest-rate of 6%, compounded annually:   $542,324 	 

Okay--Once more:

<b>Without a child:</b>  <h2> Positive $542,324</h2>
If you make $50,000/year, you get to retire ten years early!  Congratulations on not destroying your future or trying to live vicariously through your offspring!  You can have a motorhome and all of the Denny's breakfasts you want!

<b>With a child:</b>  <h2>Negative $190,000</h2>
If you make $50,000/year, you need to put off retiring an extra 4 years <i>just</i> to work off the <i>debt</i> caused soley by your darling little angel.  Oh, and you DID get a chance to go to college, right?  Did everything you wanted to do with your life?  Traveled?  ...Is that a Lego block you have stuck up your nose?  Great job there.


Lastly:

I hear a lot of pro-lifers going on about how you can't vacuum out something with a heartbeat.  The muscles that make the heart are one of the first things to form.  They start convulsing before there is even a brain formed enough to tell the muscles how often they should be moving.  
It's not a baby.  It's a throbbing, parasitic tumor. 
It takes a few more weeks after this point before you can even tell by looking at it if the fetus is from a chimpanzee, a human or a pig.  Yeah, a pig.  I could stick a fetal pig in your uterus and you wouldn't know from looking at it until you'd been a walking piggy-condo for well over a month.

Ah, the miracle of life!"

"event","As much as I like to know one way or another the outcome of job interviews, I am getting kind of tired of the rejection.  I hate the waiting and wondering for weeks on end, and having no idea if there is still hope that I've been hired, or if some other cocksucker already has the job that is rightfully mine.  Yes, I said COCKSUCKER!  AND I MEANT IT!!!!!  
As you may have guessed, I just got yet another ""We are sorry to inform you that we have chosen another candidate."" phone call.  I'm waiting patiently for a similar letter from Intuit.  I keep applying for jobs, but that's mostly so Ken doesn't kick me out of the house.  I'm frankly so discouraged/hopeless that I don't want to get out of bed most mornings.  I get random pangs of severe misery that are just about enough to send me straight for the kitchen knives.  (Generally, slitting one's wrists is not the most effective manner of doing things, but I do a good amount of injury to myself just trying to wash the fucking things.  I should buy stock in Band-Aid.)  Anyway, yeah.
I cook.  I clean.  I job hunt.  I nap.  I surf the net.  I work on Illustrator art.  I wish I could disappear.  
I regret leaving Telco, as much as I hated it.  At least I didn't feel so damn useless.  Not that it matters, since they laid everyone off weeks ago anyway.  
I consider taking phone jobs, knowing full well that I will end up just like I was when I got burnt out on the phones at Telco, before my promotion.  I <i>bawled</i> before work.  I would be ready to leave on time, and then make myself late by sitting on the stairs sobbing.  I threw things and cussed in my cubicle between calls.  I got reprimanded for spending an average of 20 minutes of every hour in the bathroom.  (Again, crying.)  I got home from work, and almost immediately began dreading the next morning.  The only reason I didn't walk out was because I had a wedding to help pay for.
I am sick to death of getting my anti-depressants adjusted every few months just so I can deal with life like a normal human being.  
I am a fat, useless, miserable, whiny, self-depriccating, unemployed, <i>unemployable</i> lump of expendable worthlessness."

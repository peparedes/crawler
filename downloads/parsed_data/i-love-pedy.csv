"event","summer is sooo close. i can feel it. there is something about it that keeps bringing a smile to my face. for one, summer just happens. despite the months of being away, not seeing everyone, summer has some sort of way of continuing. think about it. no matter what has happened in the past months, its of no relevance when the final school bell rings. summer has a funny way of picking up exactly where it left off before. for 2 and a half months we pretend that nothing has changed. but it has.
[[things will never be the same]]

yesterday np girls and boys won the league championship!!! i have never had such a good time with these girls. i even got a medal for our amazing 4x1 =]. we are soooo close to states.. only .06s off!! eeeeeee!!! disticts on friday and saturday i think?! and then states {hopefully) and then its all over..

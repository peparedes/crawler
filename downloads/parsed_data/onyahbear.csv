"event","For the record, when on Monday at around noon I noticed that my car had disappeared from my parking spot, I:

a) Checked the other spots, the street, and the side-streets to make sure it hadn't been moved.
b) Called my landlord to make sure it hadn't been towed, but couldn't get him because it was a holiday weekend.
c) Called the towing company used by my landlord, and then all of the other towing companies in town. 
d) Called the police.
e) Called GEICO. 
f) Talked over the theft with C, A, and R (...in that order!  funny coincidence) who convinced me that I shouldn't have been <i>quite</i> so insistent, in statements to the police and insurance agent, that my car door had been unlocked.  
g) Called the police and insurer back to explain that I didn't know what had come over me when I'd said the door had been unlocked, I must have been casting around in my mind for something that would explain the shocking randomness of the theft.   
i) Called my parents to explain what had happened to my car (actually my mother's car). My mother said, ""Other than the car being stolen, how was your weekend?""
j) Was consoled by R and C (lol), who said I'd save a lot of money on gas and insurance and reminded me that New Brunswick is on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Corridor"">Northeast Corridor</a>. 

Then, and ONLY then, did I post a quick note to <a href=""http://twitter.com/subdee"">twitter</a>.  I know the web is full of twitter addicts but come on, give me a little credit!  

So that's this week's bad news.  The good news is that Pearson HR took my side in a hearing this morning.  (Long story.)  

Hope you all have been doing well.  I've been working as an office manager for my dad in New York by day, taking graduate-level statistics courses by night. And falling asleep over my coffee every morning, XD."

"event","1. Back from Europe! As of last Monday, but ran around for a week between New Jersey, New York, and Upstate New York.  Moved out of my parents' place and into an apartment last Wednesday - so easy, all the furniture was there already and I was able to transfer my suitcase from Europe without unpacking it - Chrissie is the best roommate ever. :D Funny, good listener, supposedly too lazy to cook or clean but keeps food under wraps with the dedication of someone who has lived in a tropical country where the cockroaches are the size of small cats.  We have lots of sauces and fresh vegetables, and two of every sized skillet, but there were no duplicates when we combined our video game collections - which is what REALLY matters, am I right?  

Going to be carless starting in August (long story) so I went shopping today and was able to buy lots of July 4th things, like corn, watermelon, mustard and cherries, etc at discount.  European/Central Asian spices were expensive but I tell myself it's for a good cause, ie now that I've bought them I'll have to actually cook with them.  I also went ""shopping"" at home - took a plastic bag, my parents didn't really need that much seltzer water anyway.  

As for the Forth, I did the traditional thing and picniced.  Twice!  *g* At the picnic on Saturday, we got our British host to explain cricket to us. Turns out he was at Glastonbury* in the late 60s/early 70s: not just there, but there as a performer!  In some band called Big Dick and the Scandals, with a ""sister"" band called Beryl and the Perils. XD; This thing about all-male acts with associated all-female acts, it's kind of like fraternities and sororities?

At the picnic on Sunday, there was another guy who had been to Glastonbury this year - not for the music festival, but to see the magic stone circle.  Glastonbury has a reputation as a Hippy gathering, like Woodstock, but when you can actually dance around a magic stone circle it takes the New Age vibe to a whole new level I think.  

<small>*As you might have gathered, this is a major British music festival.  There was scandal when Jay-Z headlined last year, ostensibly because he's not ""rock"" enough.  In acknowledgment, he wore a guitar as a necklace. </small>

***

2. Although the first few paragraphs of this entry were about the apartment, tonight will be only my second night here since coming back to the US.  Spent July 4 with my parents and the rest of the nights with... did I mention that I've been seeing someone?  A girl?  Since May. She's amazing. ^^ Thinking about it, the reason it's easy to be out with R** is that when I'm with her I genuinely don't care what other people think. 

(Do I sound happy?  I'm really, really happy.  And why not? No job, new apartment, enough money for rent and to buy train tickets to/dinner in NYC, a girl with principles...)

<small>**Though as I remember I was out to some of you guys back in college, but not acting on it. So I guess this makes it official: I'm out! </small>

3. Pictures from Europe are up on my brother's facebook - same last name, and his first name is Alex. All of them are public, I'm just trying to maintain some semblance of web propriety by not linking this journal to my real name too obviously. Here's a decent one of me:

And one of him that I like because it reminds me of when we were kids and I was still taller than him: 

<lj-cut text=""Alex!""><img src=""http://sd.magatsu.net/journal/4938_693323781557_13616892_40891899_7343342_n.jpg""></lj-cut>

I had to stand on a 4-foot wall to take that picture."

"event","Sitting in the office with no work - and I mean <i>legitimately</i> no work, not that there could be work if only I would apply myself more - so I am going to catch up this LJ with recent events. Quickly, before the headache from squinting at the screen with just one contact lens on sets in!  (Will be picking up a new pair of glasses on my way home from work today.  Thick black plastic-framed hipster glasses, very exciting!)  

First thing is that I was out of town last weekend - Portland/Portsmouth/Boston/NYC.  In Portland (the one in Maine) on Friday my mother and I did the arts district in the morning, port district in the afternoon.   We had lunch at a pub where we were the only women - sort of funny, the ""commercial street pub"" sign outside was right next to one that said ""no drinking at any time"" - getting into the spirit of the place we drank beer, and my mother told me about the summer she'd worked as a waitress at a Maine resort in the seventies.  (What am I going to be able to tell <i>my</i> hypothetical children?!) 

Art district: really decent work at the Maine College of Art - acronym MECA - plastic flamingos dressed up in regional costumes. Also a nice antique fabric gallery across the street whose minder, who was about 25 and very friendly, said he'd gone to NYU and hadn't liked it because everyone was off doing their own thing, ""like in high school"" (which made me wonder what kind of high school he'd gone to).  Port district: lots of lobster-flavored souvenirs and some old houses with plaques on 'em, including one called ""Victoria House"" that had Greek doric columns, Victorian woodwork around the doors and windows, Moorish geometric patterns along one roof, Chinese-style eaves along the other, and even a tower with one of those round nautical windows.  All executed in brownstone.  It was Special. *g*

...that paragraph could have been accomplished much more easily with pictures!  Oh well.  

Dinner in Portsmouth, which turns out to be a really trendy, upscale place.  (Who knew?) We went to three breweries in a row that each had a 45 minute wait, then finally scored at an older, smaller one where the staff said the wait was only 15 minutes...though this turned out to also be 45 minutes.  XD; Proof that you shouldn't always settle for the first decent, easy thing?  

Did Boston Saturday.  Met up with my cousin and her boyfriend, who have an apartment in Cambridge halfway between Harvard and MIT.  Was nice to ditch the parents!  We walked around Harvard Square, had lunch in a cafe where the waitress snootily informed us that they didn't serve <i>those</i> kinds of sodas (ie, Diet Coke - I suppose they had Italian sodas).  Very good food though.  Walked down to the Charles river, the weather was gorgeous, the people were wearing a variety of things - unlike New Yorkers, Bostonians don't tend to follow a style code. Boyfriend pointed out the building where he has a day job creating spreadsheets calculating the economic advantages of green technologies, on those rare days when his advisor is actually around to advise him.  Discussed, with cousin, the way that office work trains you to approach every problem with ""I can put that in a spreadsheet for you"". 

Then tea in a coffee house where my cousin had work up (she paints), then MIT where we saw the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center"">building that might collapse</a>.  A bit dizzying, actually, to behold.  According to cousin's bf the more architecturally complicated, the higher the costs of repairs.  And the roof leaks, also. *g* Proceeded to browse at the MIT bookstore where every book is a ground-breaking study with good cover design - just skimming the titles made me feel smarter.  

Caught a train at 4:30 to NYC so I'd be back in time for Glasvegas, who were...not very good, actually.  XD; Sort of boring?  When your aesthetic ideal is a Phil Spectre-esque Wall of Sound, you'd better have the sound production to back it up, and they just didn't.  Closed with what felt like the the entire audience singing along to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uSdQxKaBfU"">this song</a>, though, so that was a highlight.  <i>If</i> I ever go to see this band again, I am definitely standing front and center - I'm not letting myself be taken aside after two drinks by a 40 year-old Morrissey fan who offers to buy me a third.  (Seriously, what was I thinking?  Though this did answer the question, who likes Glasvegas?  As dude was <i>way</i> up on his British indie rock canon as determined by weekly British music magazines.)  (Another nice thing about the show is that the audience was actually pretty mixed - old folk, young folk, black folk, white folk, Asian folk.  Even some South Asian folk, who I have never before seen at an indie show.)"

"event","Eugune and his cousin are visiting this week.  On Saturday we drove down to the Shore with some friends and watched Oliver gamble away his money one quarter at a time; yesterday we went into the city and saw Chinatown, Little Italy, the inside of the H&M in Soho (only I bought anything), and the inside of the Virgin Superstore on Union Square (ditto).  We also met some friends (a different set from Saturday's) for karaoke and dinner in K-town -- I worry that Eugene and cousin were bored, but too polite to say anything.  Eugene did his ""psych major"" thing where he said next to nothing, but assured us that our conversation was interesting to him.  Um, okay.

Before the new high school was built, the only thing potential homeowners ever seemed to say about Franklin was that it was cheap and the location was good but the school system sucked so don't move there.  It's nice to see people (or at least quantitative rubrics) expressing a different opinion.  

(Is Franklin a ""city"", though?  We're a township consisting of New Brunswick overflow to the north, historic villages to the south, industrial parks to the east, and forest, farmland, and new development to the west.  There's no ""downtown"" and no ""town center"", unless you count the Municipal Center, which no one does...oh well, not going argue with the ranking: Franklin <i>is</i> a great place to live.)

Should I apply for a job fact-checking doctoral theses at Princeton?  It's closer, it's full time, it comes with full medical benefits, and the work is probably much more interesting than the work I am currently doing (spreadsheets of textbook strengths and weaknesses based on reviews).  On the other hand, I'm in a pretty good position at [major textbook company] and I'll be giving up my place on the corporate ladder if I leave.  Interesting work, or secure work?  Which is more important?  

But then again, it would be nice to cut the 3-hour daily commute down to just one hour...augh, so conflicted!"

"event","Aaah, it's been so long since I've posted anything here!  I'd almost forgotten about this journal, but then I got a message from John (<lj user=""johnnyboy101"">) asking how I was doing, which reminded me that the whole reason LJ exists was so the founder would have a way to up keep in contact with his <s>college</s> high school friends.  And so...

Speaking of high school friends, I went bowling last night with a few of mine, and I am proud to say that we ALL beat Barack Obama. <lj-cut>XD I finished second, with an 86 (which is decent for me). Oliver's current girlfriend won, with a 98.  I have to say that Oliver was looking much better, even compared to the way he looked a few weeks ago (when he and I met up with Mike and John for billiards and diner-trawling.  Speaking of the twins, Mike is more confident than ever, while John acts more than ever like he's trying to fade into the background.  Sometimes you wonder whether it was a good thing for them to attend the same college and major in the same thing and join the same clubs and work together on the same final project, especially since Mike is better than John at nearly everything. But I'll quit the amateur psychoanalysis.)   ...What was I talking about?  Right, Oliver.  He's discovered a way of talking about his accident that's casual, but still acknowledges the reality of what happened to him. In other words, conversations with him are no longer horrendously awkward, not that they have been recently, but the possibility always seemed to be lurking around the edges of every conversation, and now it no longer seems to be.  So I think he's going to be okay.  

So, news!  The biggest piece of news is that I have a new job.  ^_^v I'm working at <a href=""http://www.phschool.com/"">Pearson Prentice Hall</a> as the assistant to the senior editor in charge of humanities (History, English, Psychology, Art History, etc) textbook  development.  Although in fact, Rochelle is frequently not in the office, and I am more like the department's assistant.  Everyone at Pearson has been very nice to me (especially Susanna, who told me I was ""born to be a development editor,"" whatever that means) and I really enjoy my job there. <lj-cut text=""The only awkward thing has been..."">The only awkward thing has been having my own office -- which is AWESOME, don't get me wrong, I love my  office, but the other editorial assistants all have cubicals right next to each other, which has made it a little bit hard for me to casually make friends with them. If I want to be friends, I have to go out of my way.  At any rate, after putting in some effort I'm now friendly enough with the other assistants to eat with them at the  cafeteria -- that is if they ever ate lunch at the cafeteria, WHICH THEY DON'T. They either eat at their desks or go out to eat.  ;_; The road to office friendship is a long one, full of difficulties.  At the moment, I'm eating lunch with a group of 20-something accountants.  They're very friendly, and very easy to talk to.  </lj-cut>

I'm working at Pearson three days a week, and no longer working at the library or the bookstore.  (I'm still working as a Math tutor.)  At first I thought I'd take it easy and enjoy my time off, but now I'm starting to feel restless. And so, following the same tactics I succeeded with six months ago, I've been applying to local independent and chain bookstores. (""Local"" judged by whether or not the college radio station still comes in at the parking lot.)  So far, I haven't gotten a single call back -- apparently it's harder to find retail work in March in the middle of a recession. (Who knew?)  If I can't find bookstore work, I'll probably go back to doing transcript summaries for District One, but I'll probably walk to the Rutgers student center to do them, first because the exercise will be good for me, second because the weather is really nice and it would be a shame not to take advantage of it, third because sitting at home is lonely, and fourth because I can NEVER get anything done at the house.  How does anyone manage to work from home?  How does Rochelle manage it?  

While I was still working at the bookstore and the library, I made some posts about it (under filter) at the other journal.  Now that I am no longer working there, I might transfer the content over here.  ...Well? Would anyone be interested?  

The last bit of news is that I went to Philadelphia to see Julie on Thursday.  She seemed to be bearing up well, but told the nurse that her head was a 7 (out of 10, in terms of pain)!  I never would have guessed.  I guess she's had a rough semester and hasn't done as well as she would have liked, plus she has The Misogynist Instructor From Hell for a subjectively-graded, required-to-graduate course, which sucks.  >_> Good luck, Julie!

I hope you're all doing well!"

Spent the morning at Raritan Valley getting my transcript out.  Lots of running back and forth between offices -- the only advantage RVCC has over Michigan is that the offices are all in the same building.  I crossed the main lobby so many times that after a while the guys stuck on line at the enrollment office started waving back.  

Spent the afternoon shopping for new clothes.  There wasn't much I could afford that looked good, even on sale.  After some hours (2.5) of deliberation, I bought a coat. IT WAS EXPENSIVE.  I'm still in shock over the price tag. This is the single most expensive piece of clothing I've ever owned, <i>and it was 75% off!</i> (It's an olive green peacoat. I might need a new wardrobe before I can wear it. XD)

I also bought a grey-and-red-and-pink stripped shirt and a pair of straight-cut grey jeans, together for under thirty dollars. This outfit is sooooo cute, and it matches my sneakers!

If I don't get a job in NYC in the next month I'm returning the coat. XD;

Speaking of fashion: last week I ate FOUR holiday dinners and lost FIVE pounds. How does that even work?!  The only explanation is that I've been sick since Christmas.  I can't taste well, so I haven't been eating as much. Except for last night when I went out with some friends to an Indian restaurant and ordered my food extra spicy. Sooooooo good. 

New Year's Resolutions:

2. Get a real job
3. Start fewer sentences with ""I""

"event","For Christmas, my parents and younger brother and I drove out to Ohio (although I didn't do any of the driving). We reached the father's father house on the 22nd and vegged, drove out to Columbus to see an aunt (father's older sister) on the 23rd, shopped last minuted with an uncle (father's younger half-brother) on Christmas Eve, and split Christmas Day between the aforementioned uncle and another uncle (father's older step-brother). By the way, this is all according to tradition.

I had a very good time and ate a ton of food, which I am now regretting. -_-; But I can't regret it too much because the food was very good. Both aunts (father's older sister and father's sister-in-law) outdo themselves every year, which in the case of father's sister-in-law opened the door to a nasty stomach virus. -_-; This is the fifth year in a row she's been sick on Christmas.

Partially because of this, we've been talking about skipping Christmas next year and doing Orthodox Christmas instead. Less fuss, better bargains, less stress for both aunts, and the entire family might show up for the same meal! Hey, a girl can dream.

I received gifts. XD Clothes, books, and cash: very practical. The clothes were a red scarf with white snowflakes on the ends, a pair of ""fur""-lined boots that almost fit but didn't quite (I'm going to exchange them tomorrow), and earrings.  I also got Pokemon Diamond for the DS from Alex and have actually (horror, horror) been playing it.  Almost nonstop.  For the last few days. (Well, I ask you, what else was I supposed to do during all those lonnnnng car rides?  Reading would have caused motion sickness,  the van's CD player is busted, and my parents (all of us, really) aren't very talkative.  I offered to sing Christmas carols the whole way, but for some reason, I was turned down.)"

The absolute best part is that the book is divided between ""street"" (city) slang and ""suburbs"" (what those crazy kids are saying) slang.  The street section is full of things like what to say to the woman you just had a one-night stand with and the suburbs section is full of things like high schoolers double dating in Mom's car.  There's a short quiz after each chapter and a glossary at the end of the book.  I believe it also originally came with an audio tape.

"event","Didn't get home from work on Friday until nearly nine (er, because I stayed late at the office checking email and later walked home from the station in high heels), but I was feeling pretty good anyway because I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET UP TOMORROW!  Such a nice feeling, like I had my whole life (alternately: evening) ahead of me. XD But I ended up falling asleep at 1:00am anyway, after some websurfing and light reading. DAMN.  

Then on Saturday, after taking two or three hours to get up (which was GLORIOUS), I spent the morning sorting through some of mom's old clothes ejected from my closet last weekend (hilariously, the stuff she wore after college is all back in style now), then dropped by V's yardsale looking for <lj user=""falxumbra"">.  She wasn't there but her mom was and I got all the books, movies and CDs I could carry away for free, heh heh heh.  (The way I see it, all that time and effort spent throwing things away last weekend just means more space for <i>new</i> stuff. *g*)  

Saturday afternoon I got this crazy urge to make music, so I dug out an old songbook and spent the rest of the day playing and singing old-time spirituals.  XDXDXD.  (Before anyone asks: I'm not Christian and I can't play piano.  ^^; But I can read music and pick out a melody, and sort of manage a simple accompaniment, as long as it is VERY simple. (Leave me alone, I never took lessons!  ...Though actually, since we have quite a few songbooks, and some exercise books, and (most importantly) a piano, I was thinking about teaching myself to play this semester.  But before that, the piano needs to be tuned. (GOOD GOD, does the piano need to be tuned.)))  

Later, Mom and I went out, to Sahara (reasonably-priced Mediterranean restaurant in New Brunswick), where, shockingly, no alcohol was served, but patrons were allowed to bring their own.  There was a convenience store just across the street so I thought I'd pop in for some wine and...yeah, I forgot that it's much harder to get a liquor license in New Jersey.  ^^; Liquor stores are pretty much the only places that sell alcohol here. There was one three blocks away, but that was TOO FAR, so Mom and I went without.  

Sunday, I had a shift in the bookstore, and then since I was already in the neighborhood of the Bridgewater Mall I went shopping, and got some stuff I needed, like good black shoes that won't kill my feet, and a white shirt to wear under a white blouse, as well as some stuff I didn't necessarily need, like a plaid vest to wear <i>over</i> the white blouse, and some jewelry.  Also a semi-dressy shirt, since I'm trying to even out my closet imbalance of nice shirts to nice pants/skirts.  

Aaaaaand then I had dinner, and started this livejournal post, and later I guess I'll study a little, and finally finish that McKillip book (so short, and yet it's taken <i>forever</I> to read), and then I'll maybe write a little bit about it on the other journal.  

Sooooo, that was my weekend.  How was yours?"

<a href=""http://sub-divided.livejournal.com/117232.html"">Choices</a>
<a href=""http://sub-divided.livejournal.com/117328.html"">Decision</a> 

(To summarize: I'm working at a library, a used bookstore, and a lawfirm, adding up to about 35 hours per week. I start at the bookstore and the library next week.)  

This week I'm covering for Debra, the receptionist at the firm, who is on vacation until next Thursday.  It's ridiculously easy money.  Their phone barely rings!  Half the calls were for Debra!  Only C.N. was in the office today.  But I did do some transcript summarizing, which -- yeah, it actually <i>is</i> pretty interesting.  

<lj-cut text=""details"">The firm is on contract for the <a href=""http://www.aflcio.org/"">AFL</a> and was just given the task of organizing the administrative and clerical workers of New York's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  (...the Department of Health <i>and Mental Hygiene</i>! Okay, I'm done.)  But according to New York law, managers and those with confidential access to managerial information (personal assistants, eg) aren't allowed to participate in any collective bargaining agreements.  So the firm and the city sent out a survey: what's your job title, what is your place within the department, how much money do you make, are you involved in policy creation or decision-making, how many people do you supervise, etc.  And then everyone whose survey results came back borderline was called in for further questioning.  I got the transcript of the resulting hearings, and my job is to summarize the results in each case, highlighting the factors that would or would not qualify a given person for the legal classification of ""manager"".  

...Okay, so it's mildly interesting.  XD Mostly because some of these job descriptions are <i>wild</i>, I didn't know the City was persuing half of these initiatives.</lj-cut>

Soooo, that's what's been going on over here.  (I'm also taking that class at RVCC, but uh. Yesterday we spent <i>two and a half hours</i> learning how to use a microscope.  A microscope!  And the time before that, we learned that matter is composed of elements.  I'm not saying that I don't have mad respect for the nursing students who are 100% serious about passing, I'm just saying, I don't think it's going to be a problem.)"

"event","When the good-looking guy at the tire place offers to replace your air caps at no charge, it's <i>because he wants your phone number</i>.  -_-; I have GOT to get myself a better set of reflexes for these things.  By the by, I thought I'd feel accomplished when I finally managed to turn one of these guys down, but instead I just felt terrible.  At least this way I feel terrible <i>now</i>, I guess, and not in two weeks when I ultimately stop returning phone calls.  

Update on job hunt: After a week of soul-searching I decided that what I <i>really</i> wanted to do this semester was work in a bookstore, but unfortunately this ambition has been tempered by the sad fact that <b>THERE ARE NO BOOKSTORES IN MIDDLESEX COUNTY</b>.

...Okay, I lie.  There are the big-box bookstores, Borders and Barnes & Noble, which of course are all off some highway or other. Somerville actually has two used bookstores -- one regular, and one ""vintage."" (Which is <i>awesome</i>, by the way.  Old adventure pulps!  Out-of-print science fiction and fantasy!  Books-made-into-movies arranged alphabetically by title!  Very cool, too bad they're not hiring.)  Meanwhile, New Brunswick and Princeton (both University towns) have NJ Books and Rutgers Bookstore, and Princeton Books and the Cloak and Dagger, respectively -- but except for the Cloak and Dagger, a mystery bookstore, these are all textbook/apparel outfits with maaaaaaybe a small general fiction section.    Every other independent bookstore in the phonebook went out of business over the summer.

<lj-cut text=""Ignorant Babble"">When I was in Michigan, I was shocked -- shocked!  -- that there was only one highway you could take to head south from Ann Arbor, east from Lansing, etc, because the highway system in New Jersey is triple redundant, but I what I was forgetting was that in most parts of the country, highways are for getting from one place to another, rather than for maximizing shopping space.    ^^; Seriously, property values in the ""town proper"" parts of central New Jersey are so insanely high, they put a real limit on the types of businesses that can afford to do business there.  If you're not selling food, clothing, or high-end products, forget it!  Everything else is off some highway.   (So it's a good thing gas prices are low: $2.65/gallon for regular, compared to $3.15/gallon in Michigan.  That's full-service, by the way.   I personally think it's somewhat despicable that an an entire culture revolves around driving in circles all night long, supported by low low state gas taxes, but what can you do?  It is the Way of Jersey.)  </lj-cut>

Maybe I should stop talking about things I know nothing about.  ^^;

In any case, I now have applications at Borders, Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble, Rutgers Bookstore, and Alexander Library.  Step two: revisit Book One and the Cloak and Dagger during store hours, apply at knick-knack stores in Highland Park. 

In other news, it's way too hot this week.  -_-; Should've gone to the beach last weekend.  Next weekend is going to be all about cleaning out the house.  (Next Saturday, anyway -- maybe someone is free next Sunday?  Katie, how do you feel about Jones Beach?)

<b>EDIT:</b> Got an interview at the closest B&N next Wednesday. o_O THAT WAS FAST."

"event","My parents are out of town for the weekend, but I stayed behind to get my stuff in order (finish unpacking, pick up bookstore/library applications, work on my resume, etc) and see to some household chores (caulk the bathtub, mow the lawn, clear out the basement, etc).  Work proceeded according to plan, sort of of, but I was feeling kind of lonely all alone at home -- Labor day weekend <i>is</i> supposed to be a family holiday -- so I was going down the contacts list in my cell phone yesterday, you know, figuring out which ones were NJ contacts I could meet up with.  I ended up making plans to go shopping with Lauren on Monday, but that wasn't enough -- I needed to see someone <i>now</i>.  But I wasn't quite prepared to call any of my high school friends who I knew had graduated from college.  

Instead, after several rounds of emails, I managed to get a hold of the numbers of some friends-of-the-other-livejournal people who had just moved into the area, and made plans to meet <lj user=""sesame_seed""> for dinner.  Chrissy's adorable and very tall, and I have more to say about her, but I'll probably say it at the other journal.  One good thing was that she very kindly offered to let me use her shower, after I made sad noises about feeling dirty and sweaty (because I'd been mowing the lawn) but not being able to take a shower at home (because the caulk on the bathtub wasn't dry yet).  

Two hours of babbling later, she expressed concern over whether I'd be okay walking home alone -- it was 9:00pm at this point, still perfectly safe, and for an instant I wondered whether this was some kind of subtle cue that I'd overstayed my welcome, but on reflection I think that she probably was really just worried, which was sweet of her, if totally unnecessary.  (Trouble?  Walking home?  From New Brunswick?  Hahahaha.  I wouldn't do it at 2:00am, but I live in a safe neighborhood, and I have never been to NB without seeing at least one police officer -- they're on almost every block.) 

So!  I was walking home, and <i>still</i> feeling lonely, when I decided I'd call a high school friend after all.  So I called Oliver, who was meeting Mohamed in 20 minutes to see <i>Balls of Fury</i>, so of course I said Pick Me Up Too, and then it turned out that the Hoffmans were also going, and when we got to the theater Kurt and David were also there, and also two friends of Mohammed's from college -- in short, it was an FHS alum party!  Whoo.  I don't think I've seen this many people from high school at one time since that homecoming thing freshman year.  
 
So here's the part of this entry that's for Vera's benefit:
<lj-cut text=""Mohamed, Oliver, the Hoffmans, Kurk, David G., others"">
<b>Mohamed</b>: He spent the summer in Morocco and he's starting his Masters in Chemical Engineering at Rutgers next year (actually, next week). He was sick all summer but he seems ine now.  You know he's assimilated to the States because he kept laughing at his friend Hali's immigrant cluelessness. XD Mohammed is a cool guy, I don't know why he hangs out with us losers.  

<b>Hali</b>: Funny guy, cool accent, from Indonesia, moved here last year, <i>skipped high school</i> -- he's a nineteen-year-old grad student. :o!  That's really all I know about him.  He made a joke about being a PoliSci major and when I said, Liberal Arts Represent!, he turned consoling and probably spent the whole night thinking I was some poor English major or something.  :p Didn't correct him, but I got to surprise him by calculating tip faster than a whole table of engineering students, and (gasp!) knowing the meaning of ""object-oriented-programming"", so that was fun. 

<b>Tim</b>: Came with Hali, barely said a word. 

<b>Oliver</b>: <i>Still trying to major in physics at Rutgers</i> despite the fact that he hasn't been able to do any mental math since the accident.  I worry about him, seriously.  But he's come a long long way from where he was three years ago, so there's that, at least.  Anyway, even with the weird thing where he gets stuck on one topic for ten minutes (tonight: Tang), he can still hold down the room -- he's still the funniest guy <i>in</i> the room, most of the time.  In conclusion, Oliver is awesome. 

<b>The Hoffmans</b>: Experienced vertigo when I realized that the one I'd thought was John was Mike and the one I'd thought was Mike was John.  orz I spent the next half hour off-balance, thinking: am I talking to Mike?  Am I talking to John?  WILL I EVER BE ABLE TO TELL THEM APART AGAIN?!  But luckily after a couple false starts I managed to re-calibrate the Personality Detection Meter, and then I could tell them apart again.  (Mike is the leader.  XD It's so funny, we were at Somerset Diner talking about Final Projects, and Mike was talking about how it's important to show, as an engineer, that you can lead a project from design to completion, and I was like, but surely not everyone can be Team Leader?  Aren't there conflicts?  And Mike looked at me seriously and said: Good question. From my perspective, everyone should always want to lead, but for reasons I don't understand, that doesn't always seem to be the case.)

<b>Kurt</b>: Kurt takes himself so seriously!  He's working part-time as an assistant physical therapist right now.  I think it suits him.  Definitely the best-dressed person at the party, our Kurt. 

<b>David G.</b>: Hasn't changed since high school.  I gave him my cell phone number.  We'll probably end up hanging out a few times, though I don't really want to -- David's fine in a group, but one-on-one, the conversation can get kind of awkward.  Between David and Kurk, the topic of conversation kept circling back to my love-life -_-;. </lj-cut>

NOTE TO SELF: DO NOT LINK THIS JOURNAL FROM FACEBOOK PROFILE, EVER. (Er, when I get a facebook profile.  (And you guys are wondering why I don't have one?!  New Jersey is <i>small</i>, hanging out in large groups for no reason is a <i>way of life</i> here, maybe I don't want to be constantly available >_<.))  

*deep breath* I MISSED NEW JERSEY!!!

p.s. Balls of Fury had awesome-looking previews but the movie was <i>awful</i>.  Too much plot, not enough Ping Pong."

"event","Back in New Jersey again. My brother just left for college with all the silverware, plates, cups, pots and pans, etc I brought back from Michigan, which of course he was welcome to though I kind of wanted to keep them as a symbol of my resolve to some day move out of my parents' house. -_- Oh well.  I also kind of wanted to go with him and my dad to Montreal to see his new apartment, but I couldn't find my passport. If it really is lost I might be in trouble, since I also lost one two years ago and that's not the kind of record the U.S. government likes to see in its databases.

Otherwise...not much.  I'm signed up at RVCC for the class I'll need to graduate from Michigan -- Human Anatomy and Physiology, Tuesday and Thursday nights 6:00 to 8:30pm -- and it doesn't look like there will be any problems on either end.  Priority number two is, find a job.  ^^; There are some places I'm looking into.  Overall I'm hopeful -- there's no shortage in entry level positions here, (unlike in Michigan), and other than not-having-a-college-degree-or-any-work-experience I'm surprisingly qualified for a lot of them.  But I will have to actually follow through on letters, emails, interviews, etc if I want to find employment anywhere. -_-; We'll see how it goes.  

Speaking of employment, I've been getting emails from an investment firm that specializes in swooping in to purchase undervalued...<i>anythings</i> (my mother has dealt with them in the context of recently repossessed/re-zoned state land), but I'm not sure I want to go down that road just yet.  Possibly this is a naive or ignorant opinion, but I can't shake the feeling that money-making operations like this one are, well, evil. ^^; Not any more evil than most of the private sector, I mean, but on a problem--->solution continuum, closer to the ""problem"" end than the ""solution"" end.  I don't have lofty goals or anything, but given the choice I'd really rather do something socially beneficial. And I don't need the money, so I <i>do</i> have the choice, unlike a lot of people. Why I should jump on the first opportunity that comes along when it's something I don't want to do?  

Of course this is all totally theoretical, as there's no guarantee I would even be hired if I submitted my resume.  -_-; I'm pretty sure the group has seen the resume I keep online already, but that document is two years out of date (and purposefully so).  Ahhhh, I don't know.  My mother wants me to at least interview.  (Speaking of interviews, WHAT DO I WEAR.  *panics* I need to go shopping, so badly.)"

"event","Geeze, it's been forever since I've updated here.  

Took my Stats 350 final yesterday.  I don't think I've ever been as attention-deficit as I was while I was attempting to study for that thing.  It was an absolutely lethal combination: boring subject, EASY subject, overly-wordy textbook, overly-wordy lecture slides, surfeit of review material -- but lurking underneath the smooth, spoon-fed surface, the genuinely terrifying awareness that yes, the graders <i>do</i> take points off for correct answers that aren't in the form the professor had in mind.  -_-; I can handle boredom, I can (sort-of-but-not-really) handle anxiety, but when you put them together, oh man, I struggle just to keep my eyes on the page. 

That said, the test was cool.  :p There was only one problem where I was really at a loss: what's sigma of a uniform distribution?  Not the formula, the explanation in words.  (Sigma is the square root of the variance.  But it's a uniform distribution so I was like, what variance?!  -_-; I just put down some jargon. ""The amount by which a random sample can be expected to deviate from the expected distribution on average.""  Here, let me translate:

""The amount by which"" <-- tricky stats talk that avoids any mention of <i>how</i> the numerical amount impacts the distribution, exactly. 

""a random sample"" <-- in hindsight, this was a mistake.  Sigma is a <i>parameter</i> variable, that is, it describes the entire population of measurements, rather than a sample drawn from that population (even a random one).  

""can be expected to deviate from the expected distribution"" <-- convoluted way of saying that I know it's a variance, but that the standard definition of variance (average distance from the mean) has no meaning in a case where <i>every</i> distance from the mean is <i>equally</i> probable. 

""on average"" <-- standard-issue stats-speak.)  

But enough about that!  Melinda and Anthony are back in town; I talked them while they loaded  Melinda's car.  They have an 1100-square-foot apartment in Ypsi for $100/month. *so jealous*  It's in the ""not in Ann Arbor but has an Ann Arbor postal address"" part of town too.  I think the lower rent is due mostly to Ypsi's bad reputation and possibly also the fact that they're now in the Ypsilanti school district.  (But who cares when you don't have kids in school?) Melinda still doesn't know what she wants to do.  I told her she should be a secret government agent. (10 out of 10 friends agree, M would be an <i>awesome</i> secret agent.)  

Then later, George came over and we got totally wasted. ^^; Him more than me.  He's a fun drunk because he reads a ton of philosophy and even when he's gone, it just keeps poring out, automatic-like.  He also gets surprisingly confessional, though I have the nagging feeling that this is only because I'm someone he holds in low regard. I MEAN.  I don't doubt that he values our friendship/myself as a person, but I don't think I'm on his ""must act normal or else her opinion of me will decrease"" list.  (And he's right: my opinion of him <i>won't</i> decrease.  -_-; This isn't open-mindedness so much as the fact that I'm not in a position where I can afford to judge other people.)  It's okay though, 'cause I dump on him too.  (Actually I feel like I've been dumping on everyone recently.  Sorry, guys!)

"event","I've been on a diet ever since I got back and while I haven't been <i>great</i> with it, I haven't been consistently terrible either.  There was a stretch (before the Progresso soup ran out) when all I'd eat was oatmeal in the morning, 100-calorie soup for lunch, and a half-portion of Mom's super-super-low-fat-cooking (we are talking beans and tofu, here) for dinner. And my own weight in carrots.  ^^; Well, not exactly, but I was so <i>hungry</i> and carrots were the best food I could think of to take the edge off.  All that indigestible protein. 

On top of the diet, I was doing calisthenics in the morning and at night, walking for about an hour and half a day, and sometimes doing intense aerobic exercise (read: playing DDR for an hour.  Hey, that game is intense!).   This week I got roped into helping paint the deck and mowing the lawn, though that plan died a quick death along with our lawnmower -- pictures later, but you would not <i>believe</i> the amount of smoke one piece of ordinary household machinery can generate.  

And yet I wasn't losing any weight.  Not a pound.  I <i>thought</i> I might be losing inches, but it's so hard for me to judge my own appearance, because I see myself in the mirror every day and what I see depends more on my mood than anything else, really.  Then the soup ran out and all that was left in the house, lunch-wise, was ramen -- which was of course completely off limits -- and I found myself eating things like mustard sandwiches (no meat or vegetables, just mustard) or chicken broth (not soup, just broth, although it did have an onion in it) or hummus (no bread, just...you get the idea) for lunch.   

So I thought, fuck it!  If I have to put in this much effort just to keep my current weight so be it, but it's not worth trying to lose anything.  Then, yesterday, I went to see Pirates with D, F, and O, but there was a mix-up about theaters and somehow F, O and I found ourselves at Omega Diner reminiscing instead, and <i>I ordered the coconut custard pie</i>.  Ha!  So there!  It tasted <i>terrible</i>, but man it felt so good. 

Today I find that I have mysteriously overnight lost five pounds.  

THE REAL SECRET TO LOSING WEIGHT: Being in a good mood!  ^_^v

Meeting <lj user=""apintrix""> to see the Jones Beach Air Show tomorrow.  Meeting O this afternoon to see Pirates FOR REAL THIS TIME. F is tied up with friends who are leaving for Japan on Monday, but I promised to give him a call early next week so we could meet up again before I leave for Michigan (next weekend).  <lj user=""falxumbra""> gets back on Tuesday, so there's an opportunity for another impromtu reunion in there.

N is <i>in Minnesota</i>.  Apparently he's been there for three weeks.  He's living with his brother (not either of the ones in the army, the other one) looking for work, but all he can find are part-time jobs.  He said he was thinking about enrolling part-time at the University of Minnesota, I said that would be a good excuse for only working part-time, he said Yes, and there was one of those uncomfortable pauses that happen so often in phone calls with N while I struggled to find another topic of conversation . 

Anyway.  <i>Minnesota</i>.  I asked him if he'd told anyone about the move and he said that he hadn't, so I swore I'd tell <i>everyone</i>.  So that's what I've been doing.

"event","Who the hell was I talking about when I said I came to Michigan with no work ethic, because I certainly wasn't talking about myself. -_-; Sorry to keep harping on this. I found out yesterday dropping History as my primary major messes up my area distribution requirements, so my options are either go back to Michigan and finish the distribution, or go back and finish the History major, or don't graduate at all (which really isn't even an option).

Long story short: I haven't graduated, and I'll be back in Michigan in the fall. 

Of course this isn't the end of the world. My parents are still paying; I still won't graduate in debt. And it's only three more courses. C and I were talking about this and there are actually a lot of bright sides.

What's frustrating is that I've been looking over my academic record and it really is the story of that bright young undergrad who totally lost it Junior year and began a long, slow decline into total academic insolvency. And <i>not</i> because the classes got harder. What's frustrating is that my schedule was <i>lighter</i> this year, and my grades were <i>lower</i>. And if I am completely honest with myself, I know why.

To be totally honest, I came to school very, very, very tightly wound. And somewhere around the summer of sophmore year, I snapped. Or to put it more nicely: I loosened up. I learned to relax. And that was fine, probably normal, definitely inevitable, maybe even kind of healthy. But I'd been used to pulling on a basically endless supply of nervous anxiety whenever I needed to do anything, and now that I knew it was okay to relax sometimes, that the world wouldn't end if I turned something in one day late...I just couldn't call the anxiety back into place. I didn't want to.

In other words, I needed to work our some other way of working. And between switching departments, internet addiction, senior-itis, and just plain laziness, I never did.

But I had better work something out between now and next fall, or I'm not going to graduate.

...

Summer plans: 

I'll be back in Ann Arbor at the beginning of June to have that talk with the Board of Regents (they'll probably assign me a counselor or something) and with an academic adviser.  I'll probably sign up for summer courses (at least one, maybe two) and I'll also be enrolled in the fall.  I thought I'd look for a part-time job, give myself something to do besides school.   And, and, yeah.  

See you guys early June?"

My academic affairs are settled (I hope) and other affairs, like switching banks and the books I had to leave in Ann Arbor because there wasn't space in the car, can wait until next month.  Same Last Name Legal Services is still holding a receptionist's spot open for me starting late July -- the question is, do I feel badly enough re:  shameless nepotism to look for something else, I do I concede this round and focus my efforts on next year?  I probably won't find anything <i>better</i> in the next few months... actually, the proper order of events should be, take job, put paycheck to use against criminal NYC rent, conduct future employment search from position of geographical advantage.  Or that might just be my conscience taking the past of least resistance again. 

<s>So who's looking for a roommate in Brooklyn?</s> 

<lj-cut text=""purchases, mostly"">
Of course no sooner have I imagined the paycheck than I have started imagining ways to spend it. ^^ I kind of put in an advance on it yesterday. Not that I <i>didn't</i> need those things (bras and facial cleanser), but they probably did not need to be as expensive as they were.  Castlevania (used for $30) was an impulse buy -- I thought about getting Hotel Dusk or Brain Age, but with the DS Lite my only window into the world of handheld gaming, I figured I should have at least one game that actually plays like a handheld game. And the Castlevania series is legendary. (So much so that Potrait of Ruin assumes you are familiar with the storyline of every other Castlevania game -- not that it matters if you aren't, because <i>story</i> is not exactly this game's strong suit if you take my meaning.  End tangent!)

The main thing I have been fantasizing about is laptops.  My current one is fine, but the four-year warranty is up, and knowing my record with expired-warranty electronics things are bound to come to a head sooner or later so why not take pre-emptive action? (See: path of least resistance reasoning -- and also, Dad's been making vague noises re: graduation gift. I  should say no on the basis of being a miserable failure who doesn't deserve any gifts, but I will probably say yes because...new laptop!  We wants it, precious.) My basic requires are that it be light; have fairly long battery life, a touchpad (no nubs!), and external volume control; lack media-fuction keys; handle graphics manipulation and basic video editing with no problems; and not be an iBook.  

I am serious about not wanting an iBook.  Too many people have iBooks.  By next year the number of people who own iBooks will have reached critical mass, it'll be like having a Dell all over again.  (My brother and father sometimes make fun of me for being too trend-conscious, which is so hilariously <I>Wrong</i> I don't even know where to begin.  Sometimes I wonder what they'd have done if I had truly been trendy.  Probably this would have been impossible.  I swear they're like <i>sharks</i>, first scent of interest in clothes or music or <i>anything</i> remotely smacking of a ""scene"" and they're on you like a great white on a wounded seal.) Right now I'm looking at 'tops from hp, Toshiba, and IBM. I think in order for it to feel truly new, not like an updated version of my current hardware, I'll have to spring for something exotic.  Like...an integrated tablet.  Perfect for taking notes in class!  (Wait.)  

This isn't an asking-for-help post, I just figured I'd use this journal for once."

"event","The more American history courses I take the more protective I feel towards my country and the less patience I have with the aging baby boomers I pass on my way back from class every day holding signs that say things like ""Bush: #1 Terrorist""  and the more I want to, I don't know, screw political correctness and use ""American"" in front of people who are also from the Americas (Central, South) without clarifying that what I really mean is US.  And these classes are all about United States <i>injustices</i>, at home and abroad, but the more I learn about what there is to excuse, the stronger my urge to excuse it becomes. 

IT IS BIZARRE 

If you think about it.  Or maybe not so bizarre; maybe it's like Grace Lee Boggs said, Love America Enough to Change it. Or a natural defense mechanism. All I know is I need a break from this colonial nonsense, it's messing with my head.  Perspective, perspective, perspective, perspective. *repeats like a mantra*

In other news I am living with a bunch of frickin <i>geniuses</i>. Congratulations are in order!

Congratulations Katie for getting into Yale and Amherst!
Congratulations Marie for getting into U Chicago!
Congratulations Julie for getting into...every damn school she applied to!  (Well, not yet, but you <i>know</i> she's going to.)
Congratulations Yin for landing a job with an awesome starting salary!

Why are all my friends overachievers?  How do I <i>know</i> these people?!  Oh, right.  I used to be one of them.  XD; 

Speaking of Yin, a true story.<lj-cut text=""Okay, only MOSTLY true."">
 
Y: I'm trying to figure out what kind of car I should buy.  
Y: A porshe? Or an audi?  
M: ...did you ever find your permit?
Y: *defensive* It's in my apartment somewhere. 
M: Before buying a car, maybe you should get a license?

And!

Y: Actually Eston and I were talking about this.  It's not that I have an insane desire to make money.  I just want to be comfortable.  I figure that after the first five or ten million, I'll be set. 
M: ...
Y: Eston didn't know where his limit was, but he figures somewhere around 8 million.
M: ...
S: Is it me, or is this conversation sort of unreal?
M: YES. 
Y: We have a bet over who'll be the first to buy an Aston Martin.  The loser has to buy the winner a tank of gas and a bottle of wine.

"event","Verrrrraahhhh where are youuuuuu.  *gnaws limbs* <-- classic V-type maneuver, heh. This is a shot in the dark but considering you haven't been answering calls or comments, if you (V) see this entry and want to get together tomorrow (Friday), I'm free.  Otherwise I'm off to Upstate New York (perjury) and I'll see you later, possibly not until after graduation (in April).  

Or maybe I can visit over spring break (early March)?  I was just home for the holidays when my father told me, and this is nearly a direct quote, that as we have an aunt who is in Amsterdam through the end of February, he thought my brother and I could go to Europe over break, and stay with her.  I thought this was the best news I'd heard all year but he went on to say that since my brother's break and mine are a week apart, it was impossible.  I wanted to tell him -- and I did! -- that if  it wasn't going to happen, <I>he shouldn't have mentioned it</i>.  

(Amsterdam!  Okay, I'm done.) 
 
<lj-cut>
In more disgustingly self-entitled news, I've been told that if I still don't know what I want to do after I graduate -- now that Grad School is fleeing fast into the unreachable distance, sob -- I can work for the firm for a year or two.  It's a good job, 9 to 5 and no more, not too intense, in Manhattan, for $20 an hour.  Yes, I know, life is unfair.  Anyway I've said I'd be glad to have it so unless things change drastically in the next year you can all look forward to calling me yuppie (Young Urban Professional) come August.  

Report on Break Thus Far:  My aunt and uncle's house is still a spread in a magazine on interior decorating. We're not sure how they do it and it's useless to ask, because the answer invariably involves Jesus.  Although probably this is being unfair?  Things at Chez Born-Again seem to have mellowed a bit since my uncle's operation; the gift my mother was worried about -- a puppet set that turned out to include a dragon <i>and</i> a wizard -- caused hardly a stir.  Well, I suppose even the Veggie Tales are doing Lord of the Rings spoofs this year.  Also I'm STILL BEING UNFAIR and I don't mean it, really. They're good people.  

My aunt's brother bought a house!  It's a smallish mansion from the thirties, with servant's quarters and everything.  It's not huge but it has good flow and doesn't waste space.  There's a kitchen that opens into a dining room opening into an enclosed outdoor patio, and triangular walk-in closets tucked away under the eaves, and other well-designed touches like that.  The brother got a good price for it since downtown Canton is ""a wasteland"", but there's development coming in, or at least money is going there.  I wish I'd had my camera for the attic, which was all dark but for a brightly lit square at my feet, the exit to the second floor, where the whole family stood looking up. Well, maybe you had to be there.  

Had a strange conversation with my uncle.   He called my parents the most generous people he'd ever known and in the same breath complained that my mother never checks prices at the supermarket.  Well, fair enough.  He also started in, obliquely, on overpriced Greek restaurants.  Since he wouldn't come out and say what he meant, I ventured that maybe they charge as much as they can get away with?  To which he answered, immediately and passionately, that absolutely all Greeks are con artists.  There'd be nothing remarkable about this statement except that we <i>have the same last name</i>. It is the Greekest last name in existence. 

We went to Cleveland! Mostly just to walk around public square and the downtown department stores, but I had a lot of fun. The weather was the warmest it will ever be in that city on Christmas Eve.  Plus, all those huge old stone buildings, and if you go even a little way from the main stores you find malls with the kind of stores that would never make it in my township, nonprofits, artist collectives, ITT consulting.  I can recognize this as a sign of undesirability but it was fun anyway.  We also saw the house where A Christmas Story was filmed -- less than a mile from downtown, and you can see the skyline from the upstairs windows -- but this felt sort of hollow.  For one thing the house had hardly any furniture.    

Sign on the Huntington Building downtown:

""Space for Rent!  Traditional Virtues, Progressive Values.""

What does that <i>mean</i>?"

"event","Flew home Wednesday night.  Thanksgiving dinner was with my parents and mother's brother and his wife, and their hyperactive eight-year old and Greek-Australian friends from the neighborhood. The friends were really cool.  <lj-cut text=""I learned"">I learned:

1. In Australia engineering is divided into four categories: chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical. 
2. In Greece, taxes are collected by the power company when you're connected to the grid.  So if you produce all of your own electricity (windmills and solar panels), you don't pay any taxes.  
3. It's possible to produce an unbreakable code using prime numbers.  In order for the message to be decoded, the numbers need to line up, like a series of nested wheels whose spokes will only match up when all of the wheels are aligned a certain way. Except that since it's numbers and not wheels, larger numbers can be placed inside smaller numbers, and all of the numbers are changed around constantly.  To decode this by force (without a key), you find a common factor by multiplying all of the numbers together.  However, if you use sufficient computer power on the original encryption, this kind of solution-by-force becomes <i>actually impossible</i> because it requires more computing power than exists in the world.  
4. In the 1980s, a computer company selling encryption software to private security interests (banks, mostly) was instructed by the British government to put some flaws into the design in case it ever fell into enemy hands.
5. Efficient video encoding is accomplished by paying attention to how people view motion, and only bothering to display the parts of the picture they will actually see, allowing the brain to fill in the rest.  
6. Television is not efficient because it redraws every pixel or every line, starting from one side of the screen.  For the picture to make sense, the ""pulses"" that cause the lines to redraw themselves much be correctly timed.  It's possible to encrypt a television signal by encrypting the pulses in a way such that those with sufficient interest will be able to decode the picture, while those without interest will only see static.

In short this guy was like something out of <a href=""http://www.cryptonomicon.com/"">Cryptonomicon</a></lj-cut>

On Friday I read for class, on Saturday I read for class and played Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and saw Casino Royale.  On Sunday I read for class and flew back to Ann Arbor and didn't write any of the essays I'd planned to finish over break (ahhhhhhh!)."

(Also, what's this crap about ""confidentiality""?  Please describe the problem to me in more detail than ""it is regarding civil and criminal issues""! I promise I won't tell anyone who doesn't need to know -- which, really, is more than can be said of my father.

So for the Detroit class, we need to actually go to Detroit three or four times this semester.  While I am not exactly thrilled about this, I don't really mind, either.  The class has a <i>chat room</i> (what the heck), so what I'll probably do is post there sometime next week asking other slackers who are also behind on their quota if they'd like to come with me.  I have a car, this should help.  

In other news I have so, so, so much work to do today.  All that catch-up work for the Detroit class, plus first assignments for all my other classes. *dies*  Some advice, don't change your schedule four times in the first two weeks of the semester!  

I also have an interview Tuesday for a position with the College of Women in Engineering.  It's oral history research work, conducting and transcribing interviews with U of M alumnae who are scientists and women.  THIS IS REALLY EXCITING though on the other hand, AUGH WHAT SHOULD I WEAR.  (I spent most of Thursday working on my <a href=""http://www-personal.umich.edu/~onyabear/index.html"">resume</a> for this.  If I get the job -- knock on wood -- I'll need clothing for it.  HELP, I LACK BASIC PROFESSIONAL FASHION AWARENESS.  (M has promised to come with me to the mall to look for things! BLESS HER.)  

Not sure when being spacy became an <i>attractive</i> personality trait, but hey.  I'm not going to complain. *g*"

"event","I lied, this is mainly a school post.  Skip if you'd like.  

I'm still shopping for a class to replace Gravitational Physics.  It needs to be either a HISTORY or a SLAVIC class -- or actually it doesn't need to be either, but this will make my life easier next semester -- and U.S. History is also a plus. (Because naturally, living in the United States, the one area of study I have NOT addressed is pure U.S. History.)  

Anyway who cares about my requirements.  What I wanted to post is that I am once again torn, TORN over which class to take.  

<lj-cut text=""Choices"">
1. Modern Southeast Asian History

Pros:
Haven't taken anything in this area of the world yet.  Outside interest.  There's this guy I really like and he...anyway, it fits my schedule really well. No textbook, coursepack is only $10[1], easily caught up, small class.  

Cons: Taught by this weird Russian professor with tusks.[2]  Broad topic.  The coursepack's heavy on interesting primary documents but light on historical context; meanwhile the professor's lectures are admitedly disorganized.  Also he seems to really, <i>really</i> like discussing psychology, particularly national psychologies. [3]

2. Detroit Politics and Community Organizing

Pros: 
Taught by a native.   Haven't been to class yet, but the syllabus is interesting and organized.[4]  Detroit defines Michigan, shouldn't I learn something about it while I'm here?  Also, field trips!  

Cons: 
Heavy focus on current civic issues.  (Maybe this is a plus.)  Extremely interactive, this may also be a plus -- IF I can make up the first two weeks.  (Big if.)  Assigned reading (textbooks) don't look so good.  -_- though I do already have one, <i>Please Don't Come Back From the Moon</i>.   Most of what we learn, we'll learn from newspaper clippings and field trips -- is this even a history course?!  (It's cross-listed with AMCULT -- American Culture.)  Class seems to have been designed for in-state students, especially in-state students who want to Save Michigan[5].  (I, on the other hand, am <i>out</i> of this state as soon as I graduate.)  


Basically the Detroit course is much, much better but also much, much harder.  (I don't mean harder.  I mean more involved.  I don't normally take these kinds of classes -- to my detriment, maybe.   Really, it all depends on whether Prof. Scott will even let me in.  If yes -- and if this is a History course despite appearances -- I'll probably take it.  It'll be good for me.)  

One final plus: Prof. Scott Kurashige also teaches Asian American history AND IS AWESOME.[7]

Notes: 

[1] The reason 300-page coursepack is only $10 is that our Russiam professor does not believe in copyright. OF COURSE.  Anyway here is the priate content of this post: today, on International Talk Like a Pirate Day, I went to pick up the coursepack from this extremely sketchy copy shop (basically three copy-machines and a cash register, with crates stacked as high as the ceiling acting as walls).  First, I signed I release saying I would not to use the  use the course materials for evil.  Second, I copied everything myself, because were the employees to do this it would be illegal.  Finally, everyone working at this place is a pirate.  

(These days everyone downloads an mp3 or two.  But these guys were totally the the kind of people who serve on IRC, YOU COULD JUST TELL.  Anyway I was wearing my ""Pirates For Hire"" shirt in honor of I.T.L.A.P. Day and they went <i>nuts</i>, it was awesome.)

[3] No, really, you have to see his teeth. 

[4] It's weird, I'm not sure I can explain. Okay, so today the discussion was on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Stamford_Raffles"">Raffles</a>; the reading (which I hadn't done) was selections from his memoirs and The Story of Abdullah.  What the professor thought was really interesting was that there was this class of people, almost like Nazi collaborators (his words), who acted as assistants to colonial administrators. What interests him is the psychology of these people.  They still exist today, he says: paid better than professors to show visiting academics like me around.  There's a filter between  Western scholarship and the reality.  So far so good, right?  It's really flattering, this treatment, he goes on to say.  I can sit in Raffles Hotel and feel like another colonial administrator, it's not a bad feeling at all.  

Also.  There was a Singaporean in the class, who talked about the way Abdullah's views of Malays as lazy good-for-nothings sort of matches current views in Singapore (though he was careful to couch this in all sorts of disclaimers).  The reason you feel this way, Professor says, is that the British created this artificial enclave, Singapore, for the propagation of British cultural values.  It's not that Malays are lazy, it's that Singaporeans are too industrious.  There's something scary about this, something off-putting about the way the Singaporeans all fall into their designated places <i>just</i> so.  

The professor is probably harmless.  But I'm not sure I want to take the class, because I'm not sure what the he's adding to it besides his own undisciplined observations -- and if undisciplined observations are what I want, I am more than caable of generating them myself -_-;;.  

[5] Prof. Scott is fond of bulleted lists.  

[6] There are nearly 60 people in this class.  Three of them are not from Michigan.

Notes on current classes: 

U.S. Interventions - the Bizarro version of the Detroit class.  90% are out-of-state students, most are fairly wealthy (the insanely high cost of books for this class probably had something to do with this).  Without exception students in this clas are well-spoken, motivated, organized, and more knowledgeable than me.  It's a good class, but a little bit like a Future Political Leaders of America / Future Founders of NYC-Based Nonprofits meeting. 

Islam in South Asia - professor speaks slowly, and over-enunciates everything, and uses lots of large words, and doesn't say much.  Today's lecture was an hour-and-a-half recap of (one section of one of) today's readings. The course is gearer toward students who don't know anything about either India or Islam; but although the lectures reflect this, the readings don't, hence the need to restate everything.  The other thing  that drives me <i>crazy</i> is that she is always taking credit for other people's observations.  ""It's been my experience that [obvious majority opinion stated multiple times in the reading],"" that kind of thing.  OTOH I like the readings for this class, and love discussion section.  The GSI for this course knows <i>way more</i> than the professor - it's I'm like getting two professors for the price of one.

Miscellaneous:

My brother called for physics help today, naturally I spent time I didn't have to help him -- not because I felt I owed it to him but because I can't resist these kinds of challenges.  To my everlasting shame and despair I had to look up the formula for centripetal acceleration.  THIS IS SO BASIC.  Truly, I am a failure as a physics student.  (Of course I could help him, he's in first-year mechanics and even if I can't solve problems anymore I can still describe <i>how</i> to solve them. BUT STILL)  

[Insert Freaking Out About Graduation Here] <-- this will be a recurring theme for the next, I don't know, YEAR.  (Today I realized that no matter how you slice it, my transript indicates that I am fairly smart, unfairly privilaged, and highly unmotivated.  ALL OF WHICH IS TRUE <-- also I have no skills, no area of expertise, no work experience, no extracurriculars...fandom <i>is</i> my extracirricular, too bad I can't put this on my resume haha.)  

In conclusion, this is the first time I've ever had OUR BABIES WILL BE SO BEAUTIFUL thoughts that weren't completely one-sided.  I AM SOOOOO LUCKY OMGGGGGGG.   (And dorky, but mostly lucky. :D :D :DDDDDDD)"

"event","Was a blast, though I noticed that even with a large&diverse group of people invited many of us still chose to socialize among ourselves. But ahaha, I have no room to talk, I spent the the whole night with N.  

Facts about N!

1. Met him Friday at <a href=""http://sub-divided.livejournal.com/87826.html"">this movie</a> (also, met his roomates).  
2. He uses ""ano"" and ""eto"" in lieu of ""um"" and ""er"".  I'd attribute this to
3. Picks up other people's accents liek woah  -- when I met him he had a normal Michigan accent, but last night under the influence he had an Australian accent, because one of his roomates is from Australia -- if I didn't know that 
4. He is only in first-year Japanese like me, and his friends are mainly <i>Chi</i>nese, not Japanese. But most importantly: 
5. He has nipple rings.***  

M got very drunk last night, hopefully this morning's orchestra auditions went well anyway (go go M!). As an aside, I'm pretty sure D appreciated what she was doing -- M made a very cute drunk, stumbling and helpless (and she is never helpless). D seemed to enjoy playing Manly Protector (for once).    

I turned Z down.  I don't turn anyone down, this is the source of my charm (SUCH AS IT IS), but even I draw the line at two guys in one night.  Even if when there are no promises being broken  it feels like a betrayal, and it's beneath me, anyway, I'm not <i>that</i> easy.   The terrible thing is that I like Z a lot, way more than I like N. (When it comes right down to it, I also like B more than N.) But really, who is at fault here?  Me for bringing a date, or him for only hitting on me after I'd seen the date to the door?  I feel there is a certain lack of class operative here -- though in Z's defense, he was really fucking drunk. (This was yet another reason to turn him down.  Especially when I doubt he likes me anyway.  I WAS JUST THERE OKAY.))

People I was glad to see at the party:
1. B.  Just met her, but already I like her a lot. 
2. T.  She's going to be a high school Biology teacher!  I think that's awesome. 
3. D (different D, the pyromaniac).  Our new neighbers are just not the same.  
4. A.  He's graduated to <i>$14,000</i> business deals, why is he even still trying to graduate?!

I thought I would finish this on the actual day, before hitting the bars -- and even better, that it would all danceable music, so we'd have something ready for the inevitable drunken house party afterwards -- but alas no.  Instead you get it one day late, with both danceable and undanceable songs.  

Marcie listens to the radio. She likes current music and accessible techno.  She doesn't like country; otherwise she's pretty open to different genres.  When I started this mix I wanted to use mostly ""smart"" songs I'd heard on the radio this summer, but I am not l33t in the ways of mp3s so I quickly ran out of these, and the mix ended up half that and half whatever was lying around my harddrive as per usual.

Dance Madness is out unless you have a PS2, I forgot my brother would be taking his to McGill with him.

Alex is a college student now. Geeze.

We were in Montreal three days before move-in, plenty of time to set everything up plus do touristy things. Highlights were unpacking the dorm room (...what? I enjoy stuff like this) and Alex's panic attack (""too many choices"" on the Tim Hortons menu, AND PEOPLE WONDER WHY I WORRY ABOUT HIM). We spent way more time than we should have driving around residential neighborhoods; this is Dad's preferred method of sightseeing, I think because he likes to feel he's in control. Every time we have ever been to Montreal he's had some kind of public loss of composure; this is strange because he works in Manhattan, he should be <i>used</i> to big cities.  Maybe it was the French, specifically the fact that he's the only one of us who doesn't know any (though mine is only good for reading street signs, really).

Short version:
Asianlan 125 = First Year Japanese.  SHUT UP. 
History 302 = U.S. Interventions in Latin America.  An honors seminar. 
History 325 = Islam in Southeast Asia.  To complement the Islam in Africa course. 
Physics 435 = Gravitational Physics/General Relativity.    

Long version:  
I could have taken either Gravitational Physics or Thermal this semester.  Thermal is taught by one of by favorite people (he wrote me a letter of recommendation!) but I thought Gravitational would be easier.  That probably sounds backwards, but consider: Thermal assumes you still remember 340 (heat and light), chemistry, and calculus.  Gravitational assumes that you still remember 390 (modern physics) and calculus.  More importantly, it's an introductory course composed primarily of new material.  I don't have any problem learning new things, it's doing so systematically that eludes me.  (I'm  worried that after so much time off, I'll have lost the ability to do physics.  I don't think like a physicist anymore.)

U.S. Interventions fills two gaps at once -- I hadn't taken any U.S. history courses, and I hadn't taken any Latin American history courses.  So I'm pretty happy about that.  Islam in Southeast Asia also fills two gaps at one -- I hadn't taken any Southeast Asia history courses, and Islam is all over the news.  So I'm pretty happy about that too.

First Year Japanese is what I probably should have taken instead of French, though if I hadn't taken French I wouldn't have met Steve, so I can't feel too bad about it.  The reason I chose French was, of course, an unwillingness to take what felt like an irrevocable step toward hopeless geekdom. After three years of college it's clear that I'm an irrevocable geek no matter what I do, so I might as well go all the way.  I'm nervous, though.  Even overhearing a conversation in Japanese embarasses me.  If I have to speak in public I'll probably die.  I'm also not very good at languages -- it's that inability to systemize again.  

***

I helped my brother register for classes yesterday.  ENGINEERS ARE CRAZY.  Especially at McGill.  It's an eight-semester program with <i>not one</i> class from outside the department.  My brother's going in with 48 advanced placement credits -- 18 more than I had -- but because so many classes have pre or co-requisits, it's impossible to take anything important early.  My 30 credits allowed me to take a semester off with no ill effects, his are only good for two semesters of French and a lazy senior year.  

I worry about him.  Alex is like the high-school me -- gets good grades, but doesn't go out of his way for them. (We even graduated with the same class rank.)  GPA-oriented thinking is beneath him.  But to be sucessful as an engineer you have to stoop to it, more or less, unless you are in complete command of the material at all times.  He'll do fine on the computer stuff; it's the rest of it I'm worried about. 

My parents must be wondering how they turned out two science majors. XD when the rest of the family are writers (mother's side) or politically-minded farmers (father's side)."

Thing is, I HATE text-messaging (just like I hate instant-messaging) and I'd much rather just talk to him.  Should I call?  What should I say?!  I hardly know him and I can't think of anything we could do together. (WELL, we could meet in Somerville and trawl the antique shops, then go out to dinner. Come to think of it, that could be pretty fun.) 

Basically I would like to be called first, but trying to communicate this via telepathy does not seem to be working. (...What the hell! I'm only home for another two weeks; if he hasn't called by Friday I'll call him.  Note how I am cleverly using livejournal to keep myself from entertaining any cowardly second thoughts.)

No?  Maybe you had to be there.  So dramatic!  What's this ""I thought she was happy, but I was wrong"" stuff?  I met him a week ago and never gave any indication I liked him uhhh sexually, in fact the opposite -- unless you count the fact that when he said things like ""Most guys don't know how to read body language, but I can tell you're attracted to me"" and ""The way you tear up that cup is a sign of sexual frustration, you must really want me"" and ""All women are attracted to the confident guy, the alpha male (like me)"" I didn't bother correcting him after the first few times.

"event","Before I forget:

1. Being home is really different from being in Michigan.  At home, the news is on all the time, and there are newspapers and magazines that aren't <i>Cosmo</I> lying around.  My brother and father argue with my mother about Israel.  On weekdays I walk back from Rutgers along Easton Avenue at rush hour, and the drivers that honk aren't drunk frat boys, they're lonely immigrants.  

2. New Jersey's budget crisis. I'm with the governor on this one, raising sales tax is much better than raising the bar on retirement tax and continuing to cut spending.  On the surface it seems more regressive (sales tax always hits poor people the hardest), but in New Jersey necessities -- food and clothing -- aren't taxed, and there are tax-free zones.  Plus if you tax income up to the first 30,000 instead of just the first 20,000 you're hurting bordeline poor people anyway, since average per capita income in New Jersey is over 30K and anything below that is pushing lower-middle class.  Mostly, though, I don't believe spending should be cut because my mother, on unofficial vacation during the budget crisis (she's a ""non-essential"" state employee), looked more relaxed than she has for years.  Mom's a workaholic, so if being forced to take time off relaxed her it means she was <I>really</i> overworked, and <i>really</i> needed a break.  (Tactic of NJ democrats: spending is cut, borrowing does not go up, but services do, at the cost of overworked government employees.)  

3. I think I need more substantial human interaction.  ^^; I met up with V and some high school friends on Sunday, but it wasn't that great.  Maybe next time we should meet with purpose.  Pool?  Bowling?  There's a sculpture garden in Trenton and some really good amateur theatrical productions in New Bruswick.  I also want to see <i>The Lady in the Water</i>.  

4. I met this exhibitionsist Bengali engineering major at the Red Lion. Interesting guy.  He likes Tenacious D, Stephen Lynch, and Bowling for Soup; he asked whether I was attention-deficit; he's in Glee Club and all his friends are all into S&M.  We talked for a few hours.  He's a jerk, but I like him because he's an unclassifiable jerk.  He told me that while Muslims, Jews, and Christians are getting all worked up over religious differences, Hindus like to smoke pot and relax.  He also tried to do that sarcastic thing, you know the one I'm talking about?  Someone says something you disagree with and you stare back from a position of unshakeable superiority.  The thing is, it didn't work very well, because he's too open about everything else. 

In the end we exchanged phone numbers and he said he'd call if his friends threw a party or anything.  I think...I think I might go.  Possibly I'll come to my senses about this tommorrow.  (It's not that I'm into S&M. It's that the number one thing I can't stand is feeling like I'm being judged, and in a crowd like that it's guaranteed not to happen. (Then again, maybe it will happen in horrifying new ways! In any case it'd be interesting.))  

5. I went to Dad's floor party Wednesday and had a great time. I like lawyers because they like to talk, and (depending on the kind of law) they usually have pretty good stories to tell.  It was a mixed group, little kids and college interns and guys in their seventies.  I talked to this Wesleyan grad about mutual aquaintances and this tennant-law friend of Evonne's about <i>The Elegant Universe</i>, and to Gaye about working the film industry/taking film studies courses. And I found out that Atul's father and <a href=""http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Seth.html"">Vikram Seth</a>'s father were judges in Delhi together, which was pretty cool.  The food was great too.

I went to my brother's high school graduation!  Although he'll probably never see this, a big congrats to Alex, class of '06 (and to Glen, class of '06, who <i>will</i> see this).  During the ceremony, I tried to keep the critical remarks to myself, as you never know who might be sitting next to you. 

<lj-cut text=""What I Remember"">
I've thought this before, but isn't Alex's class more impressive than ours?  V, what do you think?  Maybe the top GPAs weren't higher (except Veronica's -- damn, does she even sleep?) but the overall level of participation, in school and extra-cirriculars, and the number of things <i>accomplished</i>... maybe it's the effect of four years of Orvyl Wilson as Princial, zero years of that hack principal Bundy who ought never to have condescended to leave Harvard to take up a post at a public highschool.  Or maybe I'm hallucinating.  After all, I'm totally way better than Steve, who graduated with my rank this year.  

The speeches were excellent, especially the salutorian speech -- very inspiring.  Veronica's speech was inoffensive, but charming in its own way.  The class president and vice president also spoke well.  About the only person who didn't was Orvyl, who is a great principal but a <i>terrible</i> speaker, poor man.  

Dad wondered about the home life of the kid who had perfect attendence for all four years (""I don't remember missing any days either, but that was because going to school was better than staying at home."")  So much for not saying anything when you don't know who you might be sitting next to.  

Alex looked good, totally not like his usual self (my brother was voted ""Always a Mess"" this year, for his poor personal hygenine).  After the ceremony, we and Otto's family played resturant tag, looking for somewhere that wasn't closed and wouldn't take more than an hour (because the Project Graduation buses were leaving in an hour).  We finally went to this Chinese joint near the cleaners, THE FOOD WAS GREAT, and so cheap!  Simon Tang's family resturant has nothing on this place.  There's a new Sierra Lionese resturant down the street I've heard is really good too (V, did you know?  There are <i>five thousand</i> people from Sierra Lione in Franklin now.  That's like 8% of the population! Wow.)  

Glen, your father is a total crank.  No offense.  But everything he had to say was negative!  This was a happy day!  A hallmark moment!  Go Oh-Six!  Only graduating seniors should be a allowed to complain that the Board of Ed members took up half the stage (you'd think they were the ones graduating or something), geeze. </lj-cut> 

We went upstate (to New York) for the fourth of July.  This has apparently been happening a lot. I'm pretty sure that by this point my parents look on our Upstate neighbors with a more neighborly eye than our actual neighbors.  Before driving back on Sunday, Alex and I had the following conversation:

Alex: Are you packing yet?  Hurry up!
Sonya: As soon as I finish reading this article (on China's car boom)
LATER
Alex: Geeze, are you still not packing?
Sonya: I will!  I want to finish this article (on New Jersey's budget crisis) first.  
LATER
Alex: WHY AREN'T YOU PACKING YET.  
Sonya: Yeah yeah, just let me get to the end of this article on High Fructose Corn Syrup.  
LATER
Sonya: Okay, done. 
Alex (to Dad): Finally!  I told her to start packing before the game started!  
Alex: (Indicates the France vs Portugal game, now forty minutes into the first half)  
Dad: And?  Your point is?  
Dad (to me): What's his point? 
Sonya: That I should do what he tells me the minute he tells me to, apparently.  
Alex: It was not!  

Yeah, so that's what we're like in a nutshell.  (But <i>he</i> hadn't started packing yet either!  I finished first and had to wait for him!  Seriously, man, that's just not cool.)

"event","Oh, this is rich.   Today was going to be my first day of ""Summer Session III"" classes at Rutgers, but at the last moment I decided I needed a break from school, and to catch up on physics self-study, more than I needed more classes, especially since the professor appears to know my father <s>conspiracy!</s>.  The first class is scheduled for later today, at 6:00pm, so I didn't think de-registering would be a problem if I showed up in person to explain the situation: out of state student, taking classes to pass the time, doesn't need the credits, hasn't paid any money, hasn't been to class because there hasn't <i>been</i> a class, so could you please take my name off the registration list and we'll pretend none of this ever happened?  Also, I was drunk when I signed up and didn't know what I was doing (I wasn't, but if it will help my case...)

Rutgers drop/add deadlines were screwy enough in the winter, when the last day to withdraw without an incomplete fell somewhere between the first and second class of the term.   <i>This</i> time, the last day for withdrawal was <i>last Friday</i>.  Pull out today, I'm told, and the best I can hope for is a 50% refund (WHAT REFUND, I HAVEN'T PAID YET) and a ""W"" grade, for both classes.  

Let me get this straight.  AT RUTGERS, STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR AND ATTEND CLASSES THEY HAVE SIGNED UP FOR SIGHT-UNSEEN.  THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DROP ANY CLASSES AFTER EXPERIENCING THEM FIRST-HAND, BUT ONCE COMMITTED (IE, STILL REGISTERED THREE DAYS BEFORE THE START OF THE TERM)  MUST SEE ALL CLASSES THROUGH TO THE END, OR FACE DIRE CONSEQUENCES.  

Yeah, <i>that</i> makes sense.  -_-; now I have to figure out whether to go to the stupid class in two hours.  Arg, I don't need this kind of nonsense!  (If I don't report it to Michigan, the ""W"" won't make any difference, but man, that's $600!  Also I am really feeling for Rutgers' regular students right now, they have to put up with this crap regularly >_< .)

<b>EDIT EDIT EDIT</b> It gets better!  I went to the student account office.  It seems that although I am not allowed to deregister, I can chose to not pay for anything.  If I haven't paid by July 30th, I'll be automatically dropped from the class, with no permanent marks anywhere.  Most students do this, it seems, rather than bother with an official dereg.  

Is this normally how things are done?  Gah, I don't know, maybe it is.  Now that I know I can attend classes without paying for them until the 30th (just won't receive credit), I am oddly tempted to do so.  FIGHT IT, SONYA, FIGHT THE URGE - REMEMBER WHY YOU TRIED TO DEREGISTER IN THE FIRST PLACE :O."

"event","My father said he'd heard of it, but he must have been thinking of the <i>antiquarian</i> book festival.  The Ann Arbor book festival was low-key: twenty-five participating local bookstores and libraries put their names on a checklist, and prizes were given out to anyone who visited at least 15 of them between May 10th and May 14th.   

<lj-cut text=""Some notables"">
<b>First stop: district library.</b>
I had three reasons for stopping at the library first
1) legal (three books due that week)
2) geographic (the library is less than two blocks from home)
3) economic (the more books I could check off my list, the fewer I'd be tempted to buy later on) 

The library is down the street from the bus station and across the street from the old YMCA, so there are always a lot of non-readers just hanging around to get out of the cold.  There's also lots of non-readers who come in to take out DVDs -- the library has more than Liberty Video (just down the street) and if you return them within the week, rental is free.  The selection is really random though.  

<b>Aunt Agatha's</b>
A mystery bookstore.  I told the shopkeeper I was looking for books where the detective is a student (not just in name) and the mystery takes place at school.  The only books he could name off-hand were the <a href=""http://www.minichino.com/in_print/in_print.html"">periodic table mysteries</a> and some Dorothy L. Sayer books that're coincidentally set at college. I picked up one of each to be polite -- if nothing else, they were cheap, and anyway the first's about chemists and the second is period fiction XD.  

Then he pulled out this <i>gigantic</i> novel directory.  Did you know?  Mystery series are classified by:
1. setting (place)
2. setting (time)
2. subgenre (romance-mystery, heist-mystery, historical-mystery...)
3. OCCUPATION OF THE DETECTIVE.  

I totally didn't know this.  So if you were looking for a story about a retired librarian/mystery bookstore owner in modern-day Seatle-- well, maybe you wouldn't find it, but you'd at least know whether or not it existed.  The most common occuapation was police officer, but there was a really <i>large</i> subcategory for animal detectives.  But, alas!  Very few students.       

But I did find out that Victoria Silver wrote a sequel to <i>Death of a Harvard Freshman</i> called...<i>Death of a Radcliff Roomate</i>.  ^____^  It's sad to admit this, but when I read the first book in high school, I really thought college was like that.  Maybe not the grisly murder part, but the signing up for quirky seminars, buying speed to cram for tests, and never having to go to class parts.  

<b>Vault of Midnight</b> 
The only comic-book store on the list.  Nothing exciting about this one, just that it was amusing to imagine the crowd of mostly middle-aged women who'd descended on Ann Arbor for the book fair forced into this store.  It's in the basement of a shopping complex, you have to walk down a looooong hallway lined with comic book posters and plastic models to get there.  

I got <i>Kill Me Kiss Me</i> volume 3 (whhhyyyyyyy) and <i>Here is Greenwood</i> volume 6.

<b>West End Bookstore</b>
A used/rare bookstore minded by an elderly man with glasses held in place by a thin silver chain; there was a notice posted to the shelves titled ""How to Properly Open a Book.""  This store was so intimidating.  All of the other customers were at least forty and very well dressed.   I tried asking the man-in-glasses if he knew of any uhhh entertainingly written personal narratives from around 1900 edited to showcase ""scientific"" value, except I said ""scientifical"" like an idiot.  He just looked down at me over his glasses and said I should ask the owner who wasn't in at the moment.  Bah.  I'm a pretty sloppy-looking person, and ignorant, but that's no reason for... haughtiness, I guess is what it felt like. 

But wow, <i>great</i> travel section.  There is apparently an entire subgenre made up of people who re-trace the journeys of their Victorian ancestors.  I bought two books, one on Sicily and one on Ionia.   I <i>didn't</i> buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1421985209/qid=1147890689/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-3443902-5913542?s=books&v=glance&n=283155"">A Tramp's Sketches</a>, but I can tell you it was <i>exactly</i> like what you'd find in a New Age bookstore next to the manuals on Zen and alternative medicine.  New Age before there was New Age!  

<b>Harolds</b>
A paper, pattern, and craft book store.  I learned that that style, you know, that one that uses ornate gothic fonts and along with half a million curlicues and swirls, bright colors and foil paper with clip art laid over other clip art?     <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2880467942/sr=8-1/qid=1147892831/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-3443902-5913542?%5Fencoding=UTF8"">Maximalism</a>. Although as far as I can tell that author is the only one using that term in that way.

What I didn't do: call my mother back, after I hung up saying I would later (after the bookstores closed).  And Sunday was Mother's Day, too.  I'm horrible."

As if having seasonal allergies in New Jersey a month ago wasn't bad enough, now I am in Michigan where the flowers bloom later and, oh joy!  I get to have them <i>all over again</i>. *sneeze* *cough* *sneeze* hack* *hyperventilates* *is miserable*  -- actually it's worse here than in New Jersey, because there are more plants blooming more vigorously in a single week due to the shorter growing season.   For instance I sneezed five times while typing up the paragraph.  (Ah-choo!)

The colorscheme for campus tulips this year is purple, lavender and white. They're very pretty next to the pink and white flowering apple, cherry, and magnolia trees, and in the shade of the ivy-brick buildings at the edges of the Diag.  Er, and I have a digital camera now, so if there are any requests for photographs?  House/room/campus scene, that kind of thing.  The house is pretty nice, like most of the neighborhood it was built in the twenties.   (My bedroom, on the other hand, is a closet.)  

I've been spending a lot of time outside lately since the weather has been so nice, invisible airbourne agents of misery aside. (Ah-choo!!!)  There's also been the usual settling in/social scene/lack of computer thing going on -- but the REAL reason I have not been around much recently is that I started playing Suikoden V.  

Omg soooooo good!  I consider myself part of the RPG new-wave, where it all about production values!  Production values!  And innovation!  But Suikoden V is very traditional.  The dungeons are linear.  The scenery is mostly cut-paste block elements.  You play from a 3/4 perspective pulled waaaay away from the characters -- in short, it's ugly!  But OMG it's great.  I mean, <i>it's olde China AU</i>.  You play as a useless Imperial Prince with a snarky/angsty female bodyguard, in an inland nation with a strong river culture.  Various things happen, and your family is disposed from the throne.  Then it's YOU plus ALLIES vs BAD NOBLE HOUSE ONE (nazis? it's complicated) vs BAD NOBLE HOUSE TWO (sneaky merchant fops).  

Suikoden V would be perfcet if only:
1) [main character] ran with his sleeves trailing behind him. 
2) the text-scrolling was faster or there was a way to skip through it  
2) the names were not THE MOST RIDICULOUS FANTASY CLICHES EVER.  You know that thing, where you name a character something really weird with lots of Ys and Zs because that's exotic, and try for something that <i>sounds</i> like it would fit the personality of the character without paying attention to whether it sounds anything like the names of your other characters?  Arshat for an arhat-looking compassionate queen, Boz Wildes for a big man in a mohawk, names like Sialeeds and Lymsleia for women?  <i>Don't do that</i>.  Every time a new character is introduced, I laugh and laugh and laugh, because the names are soooooo ridiculous.  

I have also started on what I am optimistically calling my RPG exercise regimine, meaning that I do all my playing on a bicycle machine I dragged into the living room.  You really gain an appreciate for just how much downtime is in these games when you are forced to pedal through all of the load screens, cut-scenes, town exploration, easy random battles...I find it's much easier to resist the urge to talk to everyone in town a second time when every wasted minute is the equivilant of another quarter-mile of uphill cycling."

I'll be in Michigan taking classes.  

<lj-cut text=""schedule"">
9:00am-11:00am Monday, Tuesday, Thursday
English Literature 1600-1830, taught by craaaazy professor Ralph Williams

OR
10:00am-12:00pm Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
British History 1901-1939

The first is taught by an insane man, and I've been meaning to take a literature class anyway (it would count as my correlate!  I'm back to being a dual history/physics major).  BUT I'm on the waitlist.  Also 1901-1939 is the fall of the British Empire so it has all sorts of delicious parallels with today's political situation, the fall of the American Empire.  

2:00pm-6:00pm Tuesday, Thursday
Central European Cinema

This class fills me with such glee.  First of all, don't be fooled by the title: it's <i>communist</i> cinema.  And secondly, it's three papers of five pages each about <i>communist films</i> that fulfills my upper-level writing requirement.  *loves*</lj-cut>

My semester at Rutgers ends Monday May 1; I'll be heading directly from class to the train station with suitcases in tow. My plane'll get into Ann Arbo  at 8pm (can anyone pick me up?), giving me about three hours to enjoy my freedom before starting all over again with a new semester Tuesday.
  
<b>This Weekend</b>
Dinner in New York, Spamalot, then off to the Catskills (and incommunicado) until Sunday.  I have two essays to write this weekend.  

<b>Yesterday</b>
<a href=""http://sub-divided.livejournal.com/70891.html#cutid1"">Me vs. Mouse</a>

<b>Last Weekend</b>
I spent Easter with Dad's family in Ohio. My cousin Meredith has decided she's going to be a graphic designer even though she's not that great at art and staring at a computer screen for more than three hours gives her a headache. My younger cousins, four girls, are still being dressed in identical cute dresses with matching hairpins. There's something wrong about that too. Finally, it's extremely wrong and unfair that after twenty years of never getting carsick, this year I am spending more time in cars than ever, completely miserable. ;_;

Thursday was my father's real birthday, not the one on his birth certificate. It was also Hitler's birthday and Earth Day.

<b>The Weekend Before That</b>
Drove to Massachusettes to see <lj user=""falxumbra"">.  She brought me to her roleplaying club's annual convention, where I learned how to make character sheets and roll dice and also that I... really like pen-and-paper roleplaying. (SHOCK! You're all surprised, I can tell. -_-; the real question is why I <i>hadn't</i> played before, I mean I have a total D&D -type personality.)

Wsssszzzzzggggggttttt <-- this is the sound of my non-geek, non-gamer socialization skills atrophying, not that I ever had too many of those in the first place ahaha."

To all <u>Wizard of Earthsea</u> fans, the trailer for Studio Ghibli's animated movie version has just come out:
http://jeansnow.net/2006/02/25/tales-from-earthsea/

Translations:
The Japanese title is ""Ged Senki,"" the Deed of Ged. 
Therru is saying """"I hate people who don't value their own lives!""
The tagline is ""This summer, dragons and people will become one!"" 

Uh, okay.  Dragons and humans and oneness, gotcha.  I should finish Le Guin's series, if only so I can complain about the parts they got wrong from a position of greater authority.  (So far all I can come up with is, ""But they're all white!"") 

And although I realize that Wombat, to whom this news will be of greatest interest, will probably be too busy hiking the mountains of New Zeland to catch this post, here's what the director, Miyazaki's son, has to say about the project:  

<i>""My father, Mr. Miyazaki, was opposed to my directing Ged Senki. This may sound abrupt, but I want to make it clear from the beginning. ... I am not in a hurry to give the reason my father initially gave for his opposition. Rather, I hope to bring it to light in the course of sharing the details and day-to-day state of the film as I serve as director.""</i>

"event","<lj-cut text=""Cincinnati <-- note correct spelling"">
What do you do for three days in <i>Cincinnati</i>?  We killed Friday morning touring the University of Cincinnati which has, like, the most feng shui campus ever.  There aren't any quads but there are a million clever little concrete pathways, hidden staircases, and terraced hills.  The stadium is sunk into the ground and all the academic buildings are arranged around it, perfectly integrated into the landscape except for this one tower.  

Mount Adams is the bar/antiques district, and not very exciting on a Friday afternoon.  Downtown is Bank Central -- next to our hotel, PNC, GreatAmerican, USBank, and National City.  Beyond USBank is Fifth Third bank, the largest (by acreage) in the country.  There's almost no riverfront development, so the major downtown attraction is Skywalk, ten department stores and banks (and one hotel) linked by second-floor archways.    This is fun in the same way Meijer Madness is fun, ie it is very lame fun.  Not that there's anything wrong with lame fun!  (I once read an epic quest fantasy that took place entirely indoors.  The Hero had to retrieve the Master Keys from the furthest reaches of the House, surmounting various Rooms along the way, each more dangerous than the last!!!  For instance, there was one room with jungle-patterned wallpaper where he had to kill a tiger XD.)  

Saturday we converted the campus-exploratory spirit and my father's nostalgia into an extended Midwest college tour.  Miami University in Oxford: brick buildings on quads, student housing with hand-painted ode-to-binge-drinking flags, students are all FBLA-types.  Antioch College in Clinton: import knick knacks, new-age coffee shops closed for three hours in the afternoon, students have dyed hair and eyebrow piercings.   Along the way we saw the birthplaces of America's Americans John Mellencamp and Sherwin (Sheerwood?) Anderson and were properly respectful of the tomb of President James Henry Harrison, who died of pneumonia three weeks after being sworn into office.  

Sunday morning was the very excellent Underground Railroad Freedom Center.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in dynamic museum design (or, of course, in the history of American slavery).   The third floor is slightly schizophrenic, though, with half the floor an information-rich chronology with diverse interests, from emancipation laws to personal narratives to women's rights to Native American rights to the slave-owning histories of the founding fathers, and the other half one of those art gallery SHOCK exhibits, which tries to convince you of current injustices by repeating a montage of five-second news clips ala the aliens in The Abyss.  (I'm not saying that there is no ""unfreedom"" in the world today, I'm saying that this kind of presentation isn't my thing.)  

Then we were stuck in the airport for hours on end THE END.</lj-cut>

Completely inadequate description, I know.  We were only there for one weekend!  And the only person who knew where to go was Dad, and his knowledge was 30 years out of date.  Cincinnati did seem like a pretty cool place to live -- just not, you know, like your typical tourist destination."

"event","<a href=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/664628"">There'll be no death sentences in California tonight!</a>  I've been following this story with increasing amounts of glee.  The defense lawyer of the rapist involved is a friend of the family.  Basically he got a California district court judge to declare the state's method of execution, lethal injection by non-certified personel, cruel and unusual punishment.  The judge's solution was to require a trained anesthesiologist on-hand to assist which, DUH, no respectable medical practitioner will agree to do.  

In case this sounds like a squirrelly way to avoid Right and Proper justice, you should know that the California death row system is screwed up.  The state got so sick of the infinite rounds of appeals -- ala my homestate New jersey, where we have had the death penalty since 1986 and in all that time have managed to execute zero people -- that they went too far in the other direction.  New evidence is not grounds to re-try the case of someone on death row unless it is submitted within 60 days of the original trial, sometimes not even then. Verdicts can only be reliably contested on procedural grounds.  

So basically if you are sentenced to die, all you can do is hire lawyers to stay the date of your execution. (That is until harassment suits like this one succeed in THE ABOLISHMENT OF THE DEATH PENALTY.  *waves banner*)  

<lj-cut text=""Thoughts on the winter olympics"">Thoughts on the winter olympics:
1. Stowboarding is an unexciting sport (because it's harder than it looks instead of the other way around), but at least the snowboarders have the right attitude.  Go all the way, even if it means messing up sometimes.  Refreshing.  

2. Like I told Marcie, Peter Weir's men's long program outfit looked like he got into a fight with a fishing net and lost.  

3.  Ice dancing.  *shakes head*

4. This is only marginally related to the winter olympics, but did you know the committee voted to baseball off the summer Oympic platform?  So there will be no baseball in Beijing, or possibly ever again.  The sport was deemed ""not international enough,"" which I assume means ""too American"" because honestly, how many countries have bobslead tracks?  Or curling rinks?  I know it's Canada's national sport, but...</lj-cut>

A belated shout-out to <lj user=""falxumbra"">, who made last Friday in New York the best Friday in New York all year!  We went shopping.  I spent $75 on comics and $65 on books, and I don't regret any of it except maybe one of the books.  A thousand-page book written from the perspective of a cat, WHAT WAS I THINKING.  

We also bought expensive chocolate, but I gave one of mine away to my father after he asked if I'd managaed to save any.  It was gone in two seconds.  WEEP.    

Speaking of books, I took a well-deserved break from reading after finishing <u>A Suitable Boy</u> -- which Michiganders will remember as that two-thansand page monstrosity that could have doubled as a door stop -- <lj-cut text=""but lately I've been reading"">but lately I've been reading:

&bull; Tripoint (I thought I'd feel better about a C.J. Cherrarah book <i>without</i> the sentient alien lizards, but this book is anti-readable)
&bull; Please Don't Come Back From the Moon (I only bought this 'cause it's set in Detroit)
&bull; How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents (memoirs, told backwards like Momento!  Grrrreat stuff, the writing is hodgepodge but briiliant)
&bull; Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (completely bizare and totally great)
&bull; Norweigian Wood (same author as above, surprisingly normal)
&bull; The Eyrie Affair (I don't think I like the Thursday next series, too many clever parts that, if you stop to think about them, don't make sense)
</lj-cut>

I'm apparently spending this weekend in Cinicinnatti.  Go figure.  In-car reading is any of the above that I haven't finished yet, The Collected Letters of Rimbauld, The Complete Works of Jules Verne, and I Am a Cat.  Because DAMNIT I'M GETTING MY MONEY'S WORTH.   

Classes here continue to be awesome, full stop.  Right now I am reading about the trans-Saharan slave trade for one class and really, really dirty poetry for the other."

"event","V, the plan is we pick up Drew at Busch around eight, make Felix's between eight and nine, meet Nathan at the theater around ten thirty.  Or something.  You should call me, you have my cell phone number.  

Class schedule:
Mondays and Thursdays, 9:00am-1:30 pm: Islam in Africa, Classical Arabic Literature in Translation. 
The first is taught by the head of the African Studies Department, a woman with a strong midwestern accent who is much more interested in Islamic gender relations than she lets on in the syllabus.  I'm expecting some men to drop the course.  The Classical Arabic instructor has a cult following.  I think I know why -- he does a great deadpan, I-am-a-man-of-dignity-and-taste, while saying the most outrageous stuff.  It's better than street theater.

Mondays and Wednesdays, 5:30pm-7:00pm: Writing for the Sciences.  
The idea is to turn scientific research into accessible, engaging articles like what <i>Popular Science</i> might publish.  It's exactly the thing I most enjoyed about my summer research project; I am going to love this course or I will want to know the reason why.  

Felix King and his ilk have commandeered an entire section of the Red Lion cafe in the Rutgers Student Center.  Every day preliminary scouts stake out and mark the territory; second and third waves secure the perimeter; a steady flow of reinforcements arrives throughout the afternoon and into the evening.  All fair and good.  But what's up with the fancy lounge area being connected to a cafe that only sells peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and mini boxes of cereal?  

While I'm at it:  Why are classes at Rutgers <i>smaller</i> than classes at Michigan?  Why are our social security numbers used for everything? Too hard to assign ID numbers?  Why is the drop/add deadline next Monday, after some classes have only met one time?  I suppose <i>we</i> are supposed to choose based solely on the quality of the syllabi, and on how well our professors read from them on the first day of class."

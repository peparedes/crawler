"event","Well,

CPU fan is close to stopping completely, so I have to keep my computer turned off until I get a new one, which could be a couple weeks from now. Only access to a computer is my Mum's, and hers isn't all that great when it comes to doing stuff.

So, no pics on DA for a time, and no games to be played either, unless on the PS2. :P
All in all, I'll be checking my emails as much as I can, so don't hesitate to buzz me there! Or if you catch me on GoogleTalk, that'd work too."

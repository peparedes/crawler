I'm back to living with my father.
On the 28th of march I will be getting an apartment, if everything goes as planned, with my (ex)room mate and (current)significant other.
I'm starting my job soon (Whenever I can get ahold of John), which automatically starts my GED educational stuff.
Things are, for the most part, going well.


I went to pig-stock, felt a bit childish, got sick from the heat, had an all in all good time.
Not sure why but every time I spotted Josh and Zara my mind went blank and I just sort of started then walked in the opposite direction.
I'd like to apologize if you read this, Josh.
I knew you'd be there, I asked specifically so I wouldn't feel awkward if you went.
I'm not really sure why it was a shock to see you there. :/


Ash has gotten BIGGER. He's growing into his head, and he's got my nose.
Even <i>I</i> can tell by looking at him that we're related. Geeky baby. :)
I feel good about getting back into his life, and I hope I'm not resented for it.
Because I'm not getting out of it again.
I look forward to seeing his first steps, or at least his second (Josh'll probably be there for the first).  He has the ODDEST shoulder blades I've ever seen. By that, I mean disturbing. When you put his arms straight up, they stick out what seems like a good four feet.
He smiles constantly, and he's got SO many teeth. Let's hope he takes after Josh, for those of you who have seen my bottom teeth. Crowding's a bitch. That and some other nerve complication things that seem to run in my family.  My initial fears of him screaming when I picked him up were put to rest. he seems to be doing okay with me so far. Good, because the first time I saw him he screamed and reached for Sue. I deserved that, he never got to know me, but damn that hurt more than I thought...
He even cried when I put him down, saturday. After trying to chew on various parts of my face.

I need sleep. I went tubing for the first time and got my ass kicked by rock solid (At least, that's how it felt when I was flipped out of the tube) river water, and I need to call tomorrow to set  up a time to see the baby. Sleep."

I still can't log into my account at home, and things have gone from bad to worse. Now I can't even read my non-friends only...friends..posts..I'm not even going to bother spellchecking this or correcting grammar, so eat my stench.
The car got impounded because Chris took off to get more beer when we were at the cabin in muscatine, so we had to walk home. Suckass. Mmk.
SO, we had to pawn the computer at Beau's to get the cash to bail the car out. Shortly after, Beau goes to court because I ended up calling the cops on him for trying to slit his wrists and he had warrants in Iowa. By the way, Beau is my live-in boyfriend. Or rather, I'm his live-in girlfriend. We've been dating for a while. He's a 200 pound musclebound perpetually angry guy with a shaved head and a red goatee. *Heart*. And he's got huge hands. That's a big thing for me. That and noses..Hmmm. Where was I? We're fixing Beau's old computer room up for the baby, my baby. Yes, I'm a teenage statistic. But he's adorable. And you know most babies are butt-fugly. Admit it. Last night I got plastered at a party with a couple friends and ended up ditched somewhere in davenport, peeing on cars as we stumbled our way home. All in good fun. I don't really feel like writing anymore, but I'll try and keep..whoever bothers reading this...updated on my life.


Peace owwwwt."

I wake up, come downstairs, and who's on the couch?
If you're going to just show up, at least have the courtesy to do it a little later.</div>"

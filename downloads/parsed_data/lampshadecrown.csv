armed with a some great new albums from my brother, an inspiring book from my pappa,and hot eyeliner from my momma i am all set to rock out for the next three weeks in this city. after that, i don't even want to think about howlonely and isolated i anticipate feeling  in ithaca (or buffalo) being the friendless and  stranded fuck that i really am.

needless to say 20 mins later a got a good number  of adults and staff memebers in on. and i know i am evil but i hope they lay awake tonight imagining what happened to that fateful 7 year old.

"event","Last night, we all piled into a beat up but brute of stationwagon and drove to the next town over to go contra dancing. What is contra dancing you ask ? Well,  according to Les Francey and Farrell Boyce, Contra Dancing is a form of American folk dance in which the dancers form a set of two parallel lines which run the length of the hall. Each dance consists of a sequence of moves that ends with couples having progressed one position up or down the set. As the sequence is repeated, a couple will eventually dance with every other couple in the set. Contra Dancing was all the rage in 1800.

Let me tell you there are some serious hardcore contra dancers out there that you don't want to mess. We all got some sneers and cold stares from the over over eighty crowd.I also meet a man who donned an Phantom of the Operasque  outfit with three gold rings as his daily attire. He went by Forton Willard.

 this one is for you my darling c-bear.

everyone one of my friends in brno heard me talk about taking this picture  for the entire time went spent in the czech. each time we went to the tesco or the interspar (the supermarkets of the city) i would say something how i really needed to get around to taking that picture. not only did it take me 4 months to finnally get someone with a working digital camera ( thanks to sir per from norway ) but also it took me just as long  to figure out what the little shop was. despite frequent stops in and looking up in my dictionary some of words on the signs, i didn't have a clue what this place sold or the service it provided.when it was wedged between jewelery shop and gift wrapping place in the middle of 3 store supermarkert. it could be any number of things. i would sneak in and investigae what kind of opearatation they were running in there every so often. but, i swear the czech kept their bussiness' under tight wraps. my theory was it was a travel agency. but of of course that was its cover !like most post commy bussiness' it had that cold and  nothing but the facts type feel to it. coustumer service  doesn;t exist. you want something we've got so you start talking and maybe wil give it to you. i always felt liek a waiting for my month's ration of toliet paper and eggs at some of these place. long q's and no one talking. strictly busssiness. i could wander into the room for a few mintutes and usually there was no one behind the counter and if some would turn up i would just say the traditional good day greeting and continue  to look around. they just  went back to  talking to themselves  and looking out into space coldy as usual as i went about figuring out what the place was.  i did this for so many stores/ or supposed bussiness establishments during my time there. i still believe most  bussiness  places are just fronts for some fishy activity. 

.. turns out it was a dry cleaning service. i saw a van with the same name while riding  on the tram one morning.because no obligations as per usual, i  jumped off followed it to the old german officer district and watched a guy unload hangers full of dresses and tuxs. bugger. maybe they hid coke or crystall meth in  the front pockets of the suit coats for thier clients. i can dream can't i ?

this was our day trip to the best town in all of moravia.( the area of the czech republic i lived  in - the other one is one you all have heard of,  bohemia and its capital is prague , naturally. not too much difference besides folk tradtions.. okay ya thats huge difference and beer, very different beer )  olomouc. we snuck into some university classrooms that were built in 4th century. or close  enough. we pratically wrote out our names in our sweat on that blackboards in was so hot. the bottle pavel aka tim is holding was the first of about 10 peach and pear cappy drins we each consumed on that day. i spent nearly 10 dollars in drinks just that day. and thats a lot of money just fro drinks.
 im making fun of tim's delightful spanish roomate  daniel with my strange pose. daniel was dressed up all snazzy and his hair was all shiny and greasy the night before as we were making dinner so we asked him if he had a date, and because daniel speaks no english we played sharade games with him for about 10 mins only figure out in fact he was going to church and not taking a shower despite the confusing action he kept repeating to resemeble a church steple and not a shower head.

oh good times...

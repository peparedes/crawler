[PART ONE]

1. What is the first film you remember seeing at the cinema? <b>Beauty and the Beast</b>
2. Was it any good? <b>Damn right it's good. I loved it then and I love it even more now.</b>
3. What is the one video cassette that you have exhausted most through repeat viewings? <b>My old Star Wars Trilogy tapes.</b>
4. What do you tend to buy in the way of snacks when you go to the cinema (having forgotten to have tea)? <b>I don't eat theater food. Ew.</b>
5. What is the best cinema you've ever been to? Why? <b>I haven't been to many theaters, so I'll just say the Puente Hills AMC because it gouges my pocketbook the least of all theaters.</b>
6. Do you prefer mainstream film or independent/arthouse/foreign pictures? <b>When mainstream films knock 'em out of the park they really knock 'em out, but I prefer indie/arthouse/foreign films because you know that you'll probably getting something different from the experience.</b>
7. Have you ever walked out of any films? If so, which one[s]? <b>I've never walked out on a film, though I have been tempted.</b>
8. Have you ever cried at any films? If so, which one[s]? <b>I've never really cried when watching a film, but I have teared up during a number of films. Don't expect me to list them all! :P</b>
9. Have you ever thrown up whilst watching any films? If so, which one[s]? <b>No film has ever made me want to throw up; however, I have been like, ""Ew, WTF? O_o;"" a lot, haha. The most recent example of that is probably all of that crazy shit at the end of Audition.</b>
10. When you see a good horror film, do you ever hesitate to turn the lights out that night? <b>Not now lol. All the time when I was younger though.</b>
11. What film would you say you have a severely uncharacteristic attachment to? (That is to say, what film do you enjoy that people would never expect you to like?) <b>My Fair Lady. I'm not normally one for musicals, but My Fair Lady > you.</b>
12. What is your least favourite part of your favourite film? <b>Not enough James Earl Jones (Dr. Strangelove btw).</b>
13. Are you ever concerned by the rash of sequels, prequels and literary adaptations - proofs of unoriginality that they are - that we seem to be experiencing? <b>Yes. I'd be less concerned if more of them were any good, of course. (The recent Pride & Prejudice adaptation, for example, is awesome.)</b>
14. What is the best film Pixar have ever made? <b>Toy Story 2 (see, sequels CAN be good!)</b>
15. Have you ever skived off to go to the cinema? <b>Yes. Many times lol.</b>
16. Have you ever made fanfiction or fanart for any film (if so, which movie)? <b>Haven't done it.</b>
17. What is your favourite film of the year so far? <b>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is technically the ""best"" I've seen so far this year, but Snakes on a Plane is my favorite.</b>
18. What actor/actress do you think deserves more work? <b>Kelly Macdonald. I can't get enough of her in, like, everything lately.</b>
19. Are there any actors/actresses who can turn you off a film the moment you see their name attached to it (with respect to a sizeable part)? <b>Rob Schneider. How does he get work? How? He was never funny. At all. Ever.</b>
20. What 'secret shame' DVDs exist in your collection? <b>In MY collection? Hell, I'm not ashamed of ANY of the DVDs in my collection.</b>
21. What actor/actress would you most like to release a record? <b>I have no idea. lol</b>
22. What is the best literary adaptation ever? <b>I'll go with Psycho - turned a decent pulp horror novel into one of the greatest films of all time.</b>
23. How do you feel about subtitled films? <b>Got no problem with them. Reading subtitles doesn't distract me too much.</b>
24. What band would you most like to provide a soundtrack for a film? <b>Pixies. I'm not that big a fan of Fight Club, but ""Where Is My Mind?"" is used to great effect in that, and they've got plenty of other songs that would fit well in a film. And it could potentially mean new Pixies material. :O!</b>
25. Are there any films out there that you think people could go away, watch and therby comprehend some part of your character (e.g. your sense of humour, your worldview)? <b>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Minus the drawing, Joel Barrish = me.</b>
26. What do you believe is the best comic book adaptation made so far? <b>Batman Begins</b>.

[PART TWO]

27. Dub or sub(title)? <b>For live action: Sub. For animation, if the dub is decent then I'll watch that; otherwise, I'll stick with subtitles.</b>
28. Brokeback Mountain or Crash? <b>I haven't seen either.</b>
29. BAFTAs or Oscars? <b>I have no preference.</b>
30. Simultaneous cinema and DVD release or preservation of a 'window' between cinema release and DVD release? <b>Simultaneous release would enable me to see a lot of movies a hell of a lot faster, so I'd like that lol.</b>
31. Vanilla DVD or DVD with extras? <b>DVD with extras by far.</b>
32. Vanilla Sky - alright or a load of pap? <b>It's okay.</b>
33. Boy who plays Ron in the Harry Potter films - a young actor with potential or just someone who's perfected a single facial expression (i.e. scared)? <b>Maybe if I saw him in something other than Harry Potter I could judge that lol.</b>
34. Hugh Grant movie marathon or lengthy hangover? <b>Hugh Grant movie marathon.</b>
35. British actors assuming American accents - annoying or unimportant? <b>Doesn't matter to me - some of them are pretty damn good (Kate Winslet in ESotSM, Hugh Laurie in House, etc.).</b>
36. Dogs can't look up - true or false? <b>False, I'm pretty sure I've seen 'em look up from time to time.</b>
37. Tom Cruise getting kicked out by Paramount - wrong or about damn time? <b>Am I the only one who doesn't think that Tom Cruise is that bad? He's a whacko, for sure, but he's generally appeared in solid, entertaining films for the past fifteen years or so.</b>
38. 3D or 2D animation? <b>2D.</b>
39. Robin Williams - better as comedian or creepy/serious actor? <b>I think he's funny, but he's never failed to impress me in his serious roles.</b>
40. Adam Sandler or a punch in the face? <b>A punch in the face.</b>
41. Adam Sandler or a punch in the groin? <b>Adam Sandler, though the end result is about the same.</b>

44. Jennifer Aniston or Angelina Jolie? <b>Jennifer Aniston. I do not understand the fascination with Angelina Jolie at all.</b>
45. Adam Sandler or the removal of your spleen? <b>Adam Sandler. I like my spleen.</b>

47. Name one unattractive woman in Sin City (go on, try). <b>The judge who sentenced Marv isn't too attractive. (Yes, I really had to reach lol.)</b>
48. Summarise the Lord of the Rings trilogy in three words. <b>Too fucking long.</b>
49. What can you see Jet Li doing now that he's finished with martial arts movies? <b>He'll team up with Owen Wilson and Chris Tucker in a series of amusing buddy films.</b>
50. Armageddon - convince me it's not crap in no more than thirty words. <b>I refuse.</b>
51. What film[s] have you struggled to understand/follow? <b>I struggled to understand why people like The Boondock Saints. Does that count?</b>
52. What film do you believe to be highly overrated? <b>The aforementioned Boondock Saints and Oldboy.</b>
53. What film do you believe to be highly underrated? <b>Zelig. That movie is hilarious, and yet I never see it mentioned alongside Woody Allen's other great comedies.</b>
54. Have you ever entertained any interest in seeing Snakes on a Plane? <b>I already HAVE seen it lol.</b>
55. Name four actors who have featured in music videos, along with the band/artist name: <b>Christopher Walken - ""Weapon of Choice"" by Fatboy Slim, Jason Lee - ""100%"" by Sonic Youth, Samuel L. Jackson - ""Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)"" by Cobra Starship (that is an annoying song lol), and Mike Myers - ""Beautiful Stranger"" by Madonna.

"event","Registration went smoothly for the most part. I tried to get into a Photography class (been trying to do so for almost two years now; it's ridiculous lol), but by the time I was able to register, the only class available conflicted with a class that I absolutely have to take this quarter. So, that was a no go, unfortunately. Otherwise, this registration session was much less stressful than the norm. I had to make a couple of changes to my preferred schedule, but I was expecting that, so it was no big deal. Now it's time to wait a month and a half for school to begin again!!

<em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie</em> was hyped up massively by fans of <em>MST3K</em> before its release, though reaction to it these days is decidedly mixed, for various reasons. When I watch the film, however, I try to keep in mind everything that Best Brains (<em>MST3K</em>'s production company) had to work against, which included several restrictions placed on the film and the departure of Frank Conniff (aka TV's Frank, Dr. Forrester's henchman), who had been around since the early days of <em>MST3K</em>; remembering that, I'm able to appreciate that the <em>MST3K</em> movie actually ended up being as good as it is.

The story of the <em>MST3K</em> movie, such as it is, remains virtually unchanged from the premise of the show: A mad scientist named Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieu) forces a former temp worker, Mike Nelson (Michael J. Nelson), to watch terrible movies as an experiment to see which awful film will finally drive Mike to madness (in this case, it's <em>This Island Earth</em>), whereupon Dr. Forrester will use the film to take over the world. In order to keep his tenuous grip on his sanity, Mike mocks the films with his robot friends, Tom Servo (voiced and puppeteered by Kevin Murphy) and Crow T. Robot (Trace Beaulieu). During the occasional breaks, the three perform skits that may or may not be related to the film, sometimes with the help of Gypsy (puppeteered by Patrick Brantseg, voiced by Jim Mallon), who takes care of the ""higher functions"" on the Satellite of Love (the ship Dr. Forrester keeps them on).

Probably the most common complaint about the <em>MST3K</em> movie is that the riffing is generally not up to the high <em>MST3K</em> standard, which I both agree and disagree with to a certain extent. It's certainly a fact that the references made during the film are ""dumbed down"" a bit: In an attempt to appeal to a more general audience, Gramercy Pictures, the distributor of the film, insisted that much of the film's material be made more accessible. Many of the references made during the course of the movie are easily recognizable if you have a decent pop culture mind. In addition to that, some riffs were made more vulgar than is the norm on the show so that the film would be rated PG-13 (Tom Servo says 'shit' probably two or three times, with only one of those lines being at all funny*, and there are a few direct drug references).

However, I don't think that more recognizable references automatically = less humor. It's a lot of fun to deduce just where the hell some of the obscure references on <em>MST3K</em> originate, or even to be one of the few whom recognize an especially bizarre one without looking it up, but it's not as if that alone makes them good jokes. <em>MST3K: The Movie</em>'s references are still pretty sharp and funny, and, in my opinion, sometimes rank with some of the best runs on the show (the string of breakfast food-related references when Dr. Meecham is doing his experiment, silly as they are, make me laugh as much as anything I've seen on <em>MST3K</em>). And as was the norm during the Mike-era on <em>MST3K</em>, the non-reference jokes really shined. Mike was always a much more overtly sarcastic host than Joel, and the 'bots during his time were more likely to rip on the poor quality of the films shown and the less than stellar intelligence of the film's characters; <em>This Island Earth</em> is no exception. Their treatment is not as brutal an affair as they sometimes were in the Sci-Fi era, but the movie really does get what's coming to it (especially regarding the film's blatantly terrible science).

Another general criticism about the movie is that <em>This Island Earth</em> really isn't <em>that</em> bad of a film (another request Gramercy made), at least by <em>MST3K</em>'s infamous standards. Admittedly, with its innovative (for the time) special effects, high production values, and some name stars, <em>This Island Earth</em> is one of the best movies shown during <em>MST3K</em>'s run (if not <em>the</em> best). Really, though, that's like saying <em>Resident Evil: Apocalypse</em> is the best film among a group that includes <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</em>, and <em>Street Fighter: The Movie</em>. <em>This Island Earth</em> has a story that has to beg to be called average, hilariously dated dialogue and overacting, and incredibly dopey characters who apparently have to work to conclude that Exeter and the rest of his giant-foreheaded crew are aliens (and just so that the audience can keep up with the labyrinthine plot, several audience-insulting ""clues"" are neatly laid in concerning Exeter's ""hidden identity,"" such as his not knowing who Mozart is). <em>This Island Earth</em> may not be that bad, but it certainly isn't <em>good</em> either and rightfully deserves its mocking.

Perhaps the only gripe about <em>MST3K: The Movie</em> that I agree with 100% is that the film is disappointingly short. The film's modest length is due to the worries of Gramercy officials who noted that their test audiences apparently became bored with the movie's concept about 75 minutes in, and Gramercy thus wanted Best Brains to cut the movie down. At around 73 minutes, the film is twenty minutes shorter than an average episode of <em>MST3K</em> (without commercials, mind), and less than an hour of that is dedicated to film commentary, so <em>This Island Earth</em> is chopped to hell. Besides there being much less commentary, though, the theater stuff doesn't suffer too badly; however, the host segments aren't so lucky. There isn't much time in the film to dedicate to them, so the result is that, other than a few amusing moments, the host segments are just sort of there. 

Really, many of the demands Gramercy made were pretty big errors in audience judgment... while the film was being groomed for general audiences, the restrictions placed on the film and confusion over the film's release date (though that's more on Universal than Gramercy) worked to alienate its core audience (nerds, basically). When it came time for the movie to be released, it had a limited release in certain ""college towns""; the film would stay in one place for about a week or two before moving on to the next city. This resulted in many fans not even knowing that the movie had been released, and by the time they found out, it would likely be long gone. Pretty unfortunate.

Anyway, although <em>MST3K: The Movie</em> has its fair share of flaws and overall is not as good as the better episodes of <em>MST3K</em>, it's still a good, funny movie all on its own, and I think that it would be a solid introduction to <em>MST3K</em> for anyone who never watched the series (especially given how expensive the DVDs are). And if you're an MSTie who has evaded the film due to some bad reviews, then it's time to take the plunge and watch it. At the very least, you know that you'll get gold in the theater segments and the riffing of <em>MST3K: The Movie</em>'s credits is a lot of fun too (and it makes me wish that The Amazing Rando were an actual <em>MST3K</em> character).

*For the record, that line is Servo's ""Whoop-de-shit"" response to two of the scientists in Exeter's hangout extolling the qualifications of the other scientists whom Exeter invited to help with his ""plan to end war."" The pure malice in Servo's voice totally sells that line for me."

Anyway, uh, no big intro because this heatwave is quickly removing any motivation I have to write anything at all. Also I'll just be doing random comments on most of the pictures because 1) This was the point in the day where we were mostly just taking pictures and 2) It's still hot, damn it.

These two were the only pair cosplaying as Mario and Luigi who weren't in a big hurry when I saw them. The suspendresses are a nice touch (I can make up words :O!), and the inclusion of the Yoshi plushie is always welcome (the poor guy must be dead tired after Mario is done with him though). These two ladies don't have the trademark Mario Bros. mustaches, but there's some mustachioed goodness coming up later if you're a big fan of the 'stache.

Weird looking figure: To me, it looks like a combination Darth Vader/Terminator. Come to think of it, though, a Terminator with Darth Vader's voice and mannerisms would be pretty cool. ""*breath* Come with me if you want to live, my son. *breath*"" Also, that is one long ass finger - does he really <em>need</em> them to be that long? I don't think so. Those legs are looking pretty bizarre too... like pipe cleaners coated in metal. And his cape looks like a cheese grater. 

Okay, enough ragging on Darth Terminator. >_>

Vincent saw this cosplayer and immediately shouted out, ""CAT!!!!!"" The poor boy is obsessed with them. He then kept nudging my sister along so that he could take a picture of her with the cat lol. We had to wait a while, though, because, as often happens, a small crowd had formed and people were rotating in and out so that they could get pictures of each other. But we got our picture eventually, as you can see.

I always wonder how people can walk around in these giant costumes all day; I hope that he/she had a way of cooling off in there lol. And a couple of people traveling around in case he/she fell over.

As my sister pointed out to me, the best part of this picture is that it looks like the Pikachu head is eating the cosplayer. It's like a boa constrictor eating a warthog. The guy is hilarious in this picture: ""Help me, please! Can you not see that I am being eaten alive??"" His arms stretch out for help, yet nobody offers. 

I'm sure that the Pikachu finished its meal long ago by this point; the circle of life is complete.

This is perhaps the closest I've dared to approach ADV's Super Cult of Doom. Lots of freebies were thrown out, and everyone was going nuts in a horrible moshpit orgy of fanboy insanity, elbowing and shoving each other in order to have a decent opportunity to snag some free crap. You see, free shit = more valuable than gold at conventions. And when it's not just OFFICIAL free shit but OFFICIAL free shit thrown from the heavens, well, it's fight or die. It's law. Ape Law.

While all this was going on, I took the opportunity to heckle the people throwing down all of those glorious free goodies, much like I do every year. Lots of ""Throw it over here, you wuss!!"" and ""You've got at least <em>one</em> muscle in your arm, right??"" Nothing too harsh because I'm trying to be a decent role model for my siblings. They won't lace their insults with any of my gutter language. Anyway, to my surprise, one of the guys throwing shirts actually threw one as far as he could, and it landed a few feet behind me. I turned around, ran to the shirt, and picked it up; I saw the people in the group turn around immediately, and I also heard their disappointed groans as they saw me picking up the shirt. To be honest, there were more than a few laughs at their expense afterwards. Better luck next year, losers. In the meantime, me > you.

The shirt sucks, by the way. It's a gray and blue Anime Network shirt that announces the channel's imminent launch as ""6/2004."" Boy can I not wait for two years ago to finally arrive!!

Here's Vincent posing with two girls. But what's this?? Could he be possibly looking at the girl on the left rather than the girl in the middle?? Which pair of ears enchant him more?? I do not know!

This is me being sprayed by Mew and Beat of <em>Jet Grind Radio</em> fame. The sheer force of their graffito tagging is pushing me away from them. Yet I cannot help but look at the camera and make a face as if everything is in control.

Uh, yeah. These two were among my favorite cosplayers at the convention: Their costumes are pretty accurate, and, really, they just look cool. I didn't get to see them skate around and tag up any walls, though, unfortunately.

The main subject of this picture is supposed to be the guy dressed as Midvalley the Hornfreak from <em>Trigun</em>. He, along with a couple of other people, played a few kickass tunes on his saxophone, including the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> theme song, the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> theme, and ""Tank!"" (<em>Cowboy Bebop</em>'s theme), which garnered a standing ovation from the crowd. Those anime fans really love their theme music.

HEY LOOK EVERYONE IT'S DESBREKO!!!!!

Ha, not quite, but there is sort of a resemblance, isn't there?

You know, I actually find this costume a bit endearing, because it's so obviously homemade (and also because it's still better than any costume I could make... except the pirate costume, of course). The guy's shield is cracking in half, his ""boots"" look nothing like actual boots, and those ears... lol. His dedication must be admired. However, I will say that that's a pretty decent design on the shield; much better than I could ever manage, anyway. I'd probably find some way to turn the Triforce into stick figures.

I chased around someone cosplaying as Alucard from <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em> last year, but I was unable to procure a photo (I had to settle for Alucard from <em>Hellsing</em>, blah). But, as you can see, I was successful in my effort this year! I like this Alucard more, anyway; this costume is far more ornate and the cape is badass as hell (not to mention the boots - ooh la la). George Costanza would love it. Those eyes are pretty freaky though. Mostly you saw those eyes being worn by <em>Naruto</em> cosplayers, but other people found use for them as well. None, however, were not frightening.

Yes, no screwing around with a cryptic intro - I'm jumping right into the Man Faye without any warning at all (but not literally, though, because that would just be gross). For whatever reason, Vincent is a ginormous Man Faye devotee, and we went hunting for him in and out of the convention center until we caught up with him outside. He was only too happy to take a picture with two lovely ladies right before this, but, as you can see, he is somewhat less enthusiastic to be posing with Vincent. I don't know why... perhaps all of that walking finally caught up to him in a very unpleasant way. If you know what I mean.

Hahaha, you thought that you were finished, eh? You fools. You are never finished!! Well, actually, I thought that I was finished with Man Faye, but Man Faye + Katamaris proved to be too intriguing a mix to pass up. I'm sorry, everyone. Anyway, Man Faye attempted to sit on the ball at first, but it threatened to give completely under his weight, so he and the Katamaris had a compromise which led to the photo you see here. Isn't compromise wonderful?

Tangent: If I had one of those Katamari balls I'd stick the most random stuff onto it. You'd probably see me walking around with praying mantises, Furbies, Spock ears, and pictures of Henry Higgins stuck to mine. And that'd just be on one side (or as close to a ""side"" as you could get with a spherical object)! With some tape, a little elbow grease, and a lot of hard work, I bet that you could stick <em>anything</em> onto those little things!

Okay, <em>now</em> I'm really done with Man Faye.

I don't know why it still surprises me that <em>Pokemon</em> cosplaying is still popular even though the popularity of the anime ran its course long ago. There were plenty of Ash cosplayers, and quite a few people dressing up as Misty, but the guy on the left was the only Brock that I remember seeing. The best part of this photo, of course, is that Brock up there has his eyes closed. If you squint real hard, he looks <em>just</em> sort of like Brock for a few seconds.

This is the Sign Guild. Its origins are simple: A few people with signs decided to band together, and then more people began joining in and their numbers kept on growing. I don't think that this was even the height of their membership; they were loud, proud, and hardcore about recruiting people with signs.

You can see Vincent there on the bottom right - they pulled him in for the one picture, but he kept hiding from them whenever they would come around again because they were a very frightening, coercive people. He especially hid from Big Kaidoh since he would have been the only person who could recognize Vincent (he's the one who pulled him in there in the first place).

I <em>told</em> you that you'd see more mustache, didn't I?? That right there is a 'stache to not only rival William Howard Taft's, but to annihilate the damn thing. It makes my dinky little mustache shrivel up and cry in shame and then stuffs it into a locker. Also, clearly I am not the only person who is fascinated by the holy mustache - the girl sitting beside The 'Stache cannot pry her eyes from its bushy glory.

This guy is a highly annoying host of some sort who ran around interviewing various people. In this picture, however, he's not doing any interviewing; instead, he's jumping up and down and dancing like an idiot while the saxophonists play a few songs. Thankfully, he was not carrying around his microphone while he was doing this, because I don't think that I could've stood both his dance and his horrible, squealing voice at the same time.

Yep, a bodyguard who accepts hugs for payment; he's a very sensitive bodyguard, apparently. What will they think of next? He must have been giving out some pretty violent hugs-for-hire, though, because his sign is looking a little worse for wear. Or perhaps it's simply due to his propensity for hugging his enemies just before he aces them with a bullet through the head. That arrogant son of a bitch.

The last picture! This fine young gentleman is of course Dr. Salvador from <em>Resident Evil 4</em>. He'd already beheaded one or two attendees prior to this photo (note the bloody chainsaw), and he charged quite fiercely at me, swinging said chainsaw madly through the air, but I was able to snap this photo and escape with only minor damage. After this, Doc Salvador was interviewed by the annoying interviewer, whom he then beheaded. Everyone wins! (In my dreams.)

And there you have it. My siblings and I went home and jabbered endlessly about the good, the bad, and the ugly at AX while also savoring our purchases. Good times were had by all (especially J.J. Evans) and more of the same is sure to be ahead next year at Long Beach. Until then, <strike>keep circulating the tapes</strike> <strike>good night, and good luck</strike> keep staring at the mustache, because it will see you through your troubles.

As you can tell from the two prior posts, I was a busy little bastard during my first day at AX, but the second day was also fraught with excitement, danger, and tragedy!! Or not. Or YES!! What I can say is that there was plenty of walking around, taking pictures, and purchasing, and, really, aren't those the kinds of heart-pounding activities that conventions are all about?

Of course they are.

Anyway, this was the day my brother and sister came along with me since they wanted to go on the day of the masquerade, when there would surely be more costumed crazies about than on any other day. We also brought along <em>another</em> special guest: Our good friend Vincent, who needed a ride to AX that day. And being the generous souls that we are, we agreed to take him along. Charity is wonderful, isn't it?

So we picked up Vincent at around 9:00 AM and arrived at the convention center at around 9:30. Since my siblings needed to pick up their passes, our first stop was the registration hall. The line was, unsuprisingly, shorter than the day before, and we were in and out of there fairly quickly. In stark contrast to the day before, the Bag-Yeller near the entrance of the hall was no longer yelling, and he seemed a bit listless when he handed the AX freebie bags to my brother and sister. All of that yelling must have tuckered him out, the poor boy.

The exhibit hall was of course not open at that moment, so went upstairs to the arcade to waste an hour. There were lots of games around (mostly racing games, fighting games, music games, and different versions of DDR), but none that we especially wanted to play; none, that is, until we spotted the air hockey tables. We all agreed that slapping things around at high speed is fun, and we thus sat down and secured spots for the next game with the old ""put a quarter into the slot"" trick while watching the slot like a hawk to make sure that some little bastard didn't steal our quarter.

Luckily that didn't happen and we played a few rounds of air hockey. For the first match I played against my brother.

Clearly, I was insane at the exact moment that this picture was taken. I'm not sure whether it's air hockey that makes me crazy, or if I just become temporarily insane for brief moments every day, but there's no denying that I am literally the picture of insanity in this photo. Perhaps it's really just the power of the mallet that corrupted my young mind - those things can be pretty dangerous.

Here's a picture of my brother, Robert, and me in the midst of our game. Neither of us had played air hockey in a long time, and so we were both a bit rusty, but nevertheless we were determined to not let the other claim victory. I think that this is just after my brother hit the puck.

A closer shot of Robert, most likely after he scored a goal. I'd like to wipe that smug look off of his face, the little... er, I mean, yeah, I love him like a brother. He's been growing his hair out for a while now, and he's looking a lot different than he did in <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v388/Shinmaru/DSCN0039.jpg""> pictures such as this one from last year's Anime Expo.</a> We give him crap about it all of the time, but he likes it, so whatever.

I beat my brother 6-5 and then noticed that Vincent had wandered off somewhere; I thought that he would be playing DDR, but I didn't see him at any of the machines. Then I hunted around a bit and noticed him playing the above arcade game. My sister suggested that I sneak up on him and take a picture of him to see what he would do. Vincent's game-playing concentration must be at a high level, though, because he hardly seemed to notice the picture even with the flash. 

For the convention, Vincent whipped up a quick cosplay... he's dressed as Kaidoh from <em>The Prince of Tennis</em>, which is an appropriate series since he's absolutely obsessed with tennis lol. I like playing it but Vincent is a madman about it, haha. He's probably the biggest contributor to the tennis mini-cult that's been going at my high school for the past few years. :P

She was one of the people who played after my brother and I finished our game. Like last year there were a few women about cosplaying as Gogo Yubari... I mostly took this because the idea of Gogo playing air hockey amused me. I wouldn't want to play against her - what would happen if you won? She'd probably kill you; and you know that she could use the mallet and puck to torture you in some insidious way before you went out. The only other option is losing. It wouldn't really be worth it to play a game against her.

After our friend(s) from the picture before finished their game, Vincent and I had a contest of our own.

And there's Vincent looking quite intense. Normally he is a happy-go-lucky sort of guy, but when competition is afoot, he's all business. Unfortunately, all the intensity in the world could not stop him from also falling to me, 6-5. The poor fool.

The puck is once again in danger of falling into the goal, but this time I can assure that I was quite on top of things. I may or may not have been muttering something at the time, which may or may not have been, ""Stay out of that goal if you know what's good for you, you little bastard!!"" Despite any difficulties I may appear to have had, I once again emerged victorious, this time by a score of 7-5. Take that, younger, less physically able siblings!!

Lastly, here's a shot of Cynthia and Robert playing a game. I don't see the puck in the photo, so it was either hidden behind the mallet at the time, or this was the point in the game where Cynthia hit the puck incredibly hard and it flew off of the table. I assume that it is the latter, because they're both laughing a lot. I'm not certain who won this game but I'm pretty sure that it was Robert.

Also, I'm just now noticing that the air hockey table is a ""Hotflash"" table... so is it the table brand that goes through menopause? *rimshot* 

Sorry, I couldn't help it. *shifty eyes*

Anyway, the exhibit hall had long since been open by the time we got down to the first floor (it opened at 10:00 AM rather than 11:00 AM like I assumed), so there was no wait to get inside. We walked in and almost immediately after we began considering which booths we should see first, we were confronted by this guy...

Yep, the end-of-the-line stabbee from the day before. He saw that he and Vincent were dressed up as the same character, so of course he couldn't pass up the opportunity to get a picture with him. We would end up seeing him <em>a lot</em> over the course of the day; I'd say that we ran into him maybe three or four times after this. It was almost as if he were stalking us...

Speaking of stalkers, the Yatti (I refuse to put up pictures of them here, but if you're at all curious then go to <a href=""http://www.myotaku.com/mamma_vash""> Mamma Vash's myOtaku</a>), whom I saw only once the prior day, thankfully, also seemed to be following our little group around. I swear, almost everywhere we went we could see the Yatti only a few feet away from us. We couldn't escape them at all; it was terrible and traumatizing - terribly traumatizing, even.

Most of our time in the exhibit hall was just spent looking through the booths... more specifically, the booths with lots of plushies and assorted figurines. It occupied lots of time but didn't exactly provide much material for pictures. There were some more amusing sights, however, including this banner. I'm not sure what makes the Tofu Robot superior to normal robots, but there must be something, especially is his shirts sell for $20 a pop. There must be more to his soy power than meets the eye...

While Vincent was searching for a couple of plushies at this booth, the poor guy in the photo made the mistake of grabbing that sword and posing like that. People kept swinging by and taking pictures of him, and he must have stayed in that exact position for about ten minutes before the rush of people slowly trickled down to a stop and he was finally able to remove that hat and see again. You've got to be careful when opening yourself up for photo opportunities because people will keep coming and coming until you can't take it anymore.

We buzzed around the exhibit hall a couple of times before getting a bit tired and settling down for some lunch. A bit earlier Vincent had called his friend Tommy and asked him if he wanted to enter the ramen-eating contest, which he agreed to do. So since Vincent would be entering the contest in about an hour or so, he had to forego the cheeseburger from Carl's Jr. he had brought for lunch. He looked so sad staring down at that burger lol.

After lunch we went back into the exhibit hall and saw this guy; I saw him whenever we passed by this spot, so maybe he just sat there most of the day playing guitar and singing. He played a decent guitar but man could he not sing lol. It was just... wow. Not as bad as the ""I Will Always Love You"" karaoke singers from the day before, but still in the same ballpark.

Following some more hunting about (and still finding nothing that we wanted to buy), Tommy called Vincent and told him that he was around some other booths, and we trekked over there to see him. He brought along another friend of ours, Juan, who also wanted to partake in the ramen-eating contest. Oh, those brave souls.

And, yes, what you're seeing above are apparently the world's first manga guides to Sudoku. Basically the manga is chock full of Sudoku games with mini-scenarios where the characters explain how to play the game while also interacting with each other in amusing ways - it's about love, life, and number games. I was tempted to buy it, just because I thought it was funny, but they were selling for $10 each, so that was a no go. There are already plenty of Sudoku books laying about my home and there are a bunch of them waiting to be played on <em>Brain Age</em>.

We did some more uneventful booth-browsing and then Vincent, Tommy, and Juan had to leave in order to register for the ramen-eating contest. My siblings and I stayed in the exhibit hall a bit longer to scope out some of the places we wanted to see in the hopes of finding something to buy... I picked up the <em>RahXephon</em> boxset for the best price available (thanks for the links, Mimmi, by the way; I'm sure that those sites will be <em>very</em> useful should I decide to buy other anime boxsets :)) and I also bought Vol. 1 of <u>Death Note</u>. I ended up buying three more volumes on impulse, and now that I've finished them I have to say that the series is as fantastic as advertised - I've got to thank <a href=""http://www.orangelazarus.net/print/death_note.php""> Dagger</a> for pushing the series so enthusiastically. Her positive reaction to the series convinced me to check it out, and I'm glad that I did.

Anyway, it was getting close to the contest time, but before we left the exhibit hall, we caught a glimpse of these guys. They're ninja, obviously, and they sort of jumped out of nowhere, switched on their stereo, and started dancing. Prime photo opportunity right there. Their antics drew a sizable crowd, which made it difficult to get a decent picture. By the way, is it just me, or is that ninja in the foreground looking sort of Nazi-ish? You be the judge.

So we left right after that, but before we went upstairs to cheer our friends on in the contest, another great photo opportunity presented itself...

Hahaha, my favorite cosplayers from last year, and they brought <strike>hos</strike> friends!! <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v388/Shinmaru/DSCN0116.jpg""> Compared to last year</a>, The Mario Pimp is about the same, but the Gangsta Lackey Toad added quite a few improvements to his costume, including that awesome Mushroom chain and the NES ZAPPER~! The Daisy and Peach Prostitutes are funny, too, especially with those Burger King crowns and the fake money sticking out of their tops. Haha. These four are the greatest cosplayers ever.

My siblings and I ventured upstairs but instead of finding our friends on the 2nd floor balcony, we found them resting near one of the viewing rooms (which might have been showing the <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> movie at the time, I'm not sure). It turned out that more people wanted to enter the contest than were actually needed (shock), and so tickets were given out for spots in the contest to be raffled off. 

So when it came time for the raffle we followed our buddies out to the large balcony, where it was pretty damn hot and brighter than the beach scene in <u>The Stranger</u>. I think it took like a couple of minutes for my eyes to adjust completely lol. We huddled around the stage and listened to the announcer, er, announce who would be participating in the contest, and of course, Vincent, Tommy nor Juan got in. Tommy decided to head back to the exhibit hall while Juan and Vincent elected to stay and watch the contest. It was still very hot outside, so Cynthia, Robert, and I took Tommy's lead and went back downstairs. 

I was pretty content with what I had bought, but my brother had not gotten anything yet, mostly because he wasn't sure what he actually wanted to buy. He looked at all of the booths in detail; however, he did not find anything that he wanted to buy that wasn't overpriced. He was a bit disappointed, though I have to commend him for not buying something just for the sake of buying it.

And who cares about buying things when there are people with funny signs about? Most of the ""donation"" signs you see around AX are basically the same: Money for hugs/glomps, yaoi/yuri, etc., but this one was the only funny one I've seen. I was briefly tempted to relieve his debt, as the logic of a poor Jew is simply illogical, but the place is crowded and we'd been in the exhibit hall a while so we felt like getting out of there (by this point it had been about an hour since we left Vincent and Juan). 

When we got outside I called Vincent to ask where he was; it was noisy in the halls and it was noisy where Vincent was, so I had a hard time hearing him, but I did hear ""2nd floor."" Upstairs we went to catch up with our friends. We started near the balcony, and of course they weren't there. We then went all the way to the other side of the 2nd floor, and on the way we snapped this photo...

I think that I mentioned before that Pyramidhead costumes were fairly popular this year, and this was one of the better ones that I saw. It captures the bloodsoaked horror of Pyramidhead pretty well, I think. Those guys wearing traffic cones on their heads acted as roadblocks and attempted to seal Pyramidhead away from moving to his destination, but with one mighty swipe of his weapon, the obstruction was destroyed.

Naturally, the last place we looked for our friends, the arcade, was where they were at. Looking back on it, I don't know why we saved the arcade for last... it seems obvious now that that's where we should've looked first. Oh well. Since the last time we saw him, Vincent had made a sign for himself and Juan so that they could partake in all of the action that the other people who were carrying signs were getting (that's Juan on the left, by the way). Just in case it's hard to see, Juan's sign says ""Hugs and Kisses from Hottie"" and Vincent's sign says ""Offering Kaidoh Hugs, Petting & Pokes"" (I'll leave you to decide what type of petting to which he's referring). I find this picture particularly funny because Vincent looks like he's going to belt out a couple of tunes. Karaoke time!!

And so ends this post. The next one will probably be shorter but will also have more cosplaying pictures and a special rendezvous with Anime Expo's biggest celebrity... who is it? You'll find out later. (Not that it's especially hard to guess...)

<a href=""http://www.orangelazarus.net/features/the_wide_world_of_shoegazing_1.php""> Once again I plug the article I wrote for OL.</a> It's an article of considerable length, but I think that it's worth reading (and commenting on!). As I mentioned before, I worked very hard on it and I honestly think that it's the best piece of writing I've done in a long time. I guarantee that all of you will find something to enjoy in there. :)

<a href=""http://www.orangelazarus.net/features/bayou_billy.php""> Also be sure to read Josh and Tony's latest article.</a> It's a good initial entry in what should be a pretty damn fun series of articles.

Anyway, enough plugging; it's time to get to the real reason everyone is here: <strike>Pictures</strike> To read about the fun times at AX. Yes, the fun, fun times. And what fun times they were!

After Josh and Aaron left, Solo and I got in line to play <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>. Well, it wasn't so much a line as a giant blob of people moving in and out, switching spots in the chairs whenever someone lost. It was pretty funny to see the people who were standing in line as the next person to play look more intense than those who were actually playing the game, haha. Because Solo and I were probably a bit too passive, people kept going in ahead of us (including a little kid - we're so lame) and we actually didn't get to play a game with each other. A sad occurence, I know. 

However, Solo did get to join in on a game, and he held his own quite well despite his insistence that he had not played regularly for a long time. There was this one guy who was just dominating everybody and who, I guess, earned the right to keep playing due to his winning ways; however, Solo went toe-to-toe with him and put up a damn good fight until the other players were killed off and he was ultimately defeated. He did <em>much</em> better than I would have done, that's for damn sure lol. My <em>Smash Bros. Melee</em> skill is incredibly rusty. I bet that anyone here who is at least a halfway decent player could beat me no problem. :P

Following the intense <em>Smash Bros. Melee</em> match, we sat down again and I took out the Nintendo DSes I had brought along with me for the occasion. Solo and had a couple of close races in <em>Mario Kart DS</em>, after which we were joined by a couple of other people who had also brought along the game. One of them stands out clearly in my head... He was a very, er, excitable kid and he was pretty animated while he was playing, to say the least lol. He sort of reminded me of how I used to play games: Lots of talking and shouting to nobody in particular, moving my hands around everywhere as if that exaggerated movement would allow me even a degree more control over the game, and so on and so forth. We raced a few times (I mostly came in 3rd or last much of the time - witness my vast skill at <em>Mario Kart</em>), had a few Balloon Battles, and played one game of Shine Runners, which is a very annoying game lol. 

I'm not sure how long we played (it was at least more than a half-hour), but we were there a while; my DS battery was just about dead by the time we parted ways. It was a lot of fun, though, and, if I may go on a slight tangent, that's one of the things I really like about the DS. Having the ability to walk around almost anywhere, spot a person who has a DS, and set up a multiplayer game with minimal effort is so great (setting up multiplayer games with the Game Boy/Advance was always incredibly annoying lol). It's even better that there are a good amount of games where you only need one Game Card in order to engage in multiplayer play; makes things so much easier, haha.

Anyway, after we left the Hilton, Solo and I went back to the exhibit hall to look over the booths and see what they were peddling, since I had not really done so the first time I'd been in there. While we were looking around, we saw the guy in the above photo. He was one of a couple of musicians I saw playing at that particular spot during the course of the convention. As you can see, he's playing a tiny, pink piano thing, but as he blew into that tube in his mouth the instrument emitted a weird saxophone-like noise rather than anything you'd expect to hear coming from a piano. I felt like hanging around a few seconds like, just because it was so bizarre, but I resisted the temptation and caught up with Solo in order to continue trekking through the hall.

For the most part we visited the booths that specialized in DVDs to see if there were any decent deals about; specifically, deals involving the <em>RahXephon</em> boxset, which I should have bought last year, but instead foolishly bought single DVDs after overlooking a great deal at the ADV booth. The very thought of that mistake still brings a bitter tear to my eye. Solo leafed through some of the DVDs and also peered through some drawings and posters and whatnot to see if something nice was available to buy for a friend or two. Unfortunately, neither of us found anything at that time available for a price we were willing to pay (bargain hunting is a bitch sometimes), so when we left the exhibit hall later on in the day, we emerged empty handed. Except for all of the photos we took, of course.

She, like most cosplayers, sort of appeared out of nowhere and I took a passing notice of her at first, until Solo remarked that every time he sees a Link cosplayer, he expects ""Des to pop out of nowhere and kick them in the nads"" (that was before we could tell that she is a girl, by the way). That visual amused me for a few seconds before I snapped back into reality and realized, ""Wait a minute - photo opportunity!!"" Yes, taking photos becomes an obsession of sorts for people like me who venture into AX. After I snapped the picture, she noticed my Mario shirt and began humming the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> theme and Solo and I joined in after a second or two (complete with goofy dance). This is the stuff dreams are made of, people.

Speaking of the stuff that dreams are made of, I've come to realize that there just aren't many things in the world that are funnier than the covers of hentai DVDs (my favorite is probably <em>Battle Can Can</em> - the mental image cracks me up). Really, nothing that I could write here could possibly add to what you see before you. Also, this picture represents a very tiny proportion of what was available here; there were two large rows of DVDs available for consumption (so to speak). Anyway, gawk at the DVDs a few seconds longer, then move on.

There was a random, funny thing that happened after we left the hentai booth and began walking down that side of the exhibit hall: I'd been wearing the beads that I received from the Viz Booth all day, and a girl ran by Solo and I, recognized the beads, said, ""Nice job wearing the beads"" (or something to that effect), and then tossed me a Toonami Jetstream hat. The whole thing happened really fast and caught me totally by surprise. One moment I was looking at some DVDs at a booth, and the next moment I was holding a hat in my hand lol. It is a nice hat, though.

I'm not certain whether or not this Hamburglar is the same guy as <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v388/Shinmaru/DSCN0033.jpg""> my Hamburglar buddy from last year</a>, but when there's a chance to snap a photo of the Hamburglar, I won't hesitate to take advantage of it. It'd be cool if people cosplayed as other McDonalds characters as well... Ronald McDonald, Birdie, Grimace, and, of course, the greatest mayor of all time, Mayor McCheese (that costume might be a bit cumbersome though). Anyway, one thing that weirds me out about this Hamburglar is that hamburger balloon - it really doesn't look like a hamburger at all lol. It looks more like a warped hamburger monster from a 50s Sci-Fi B-Movie that's foaming peas from its mouth. Weird.

This is the ADV booth during one of their calm periods; the crowds are forming to buy stuff, but no freebies were being thrown at the time (nor were there preparations being made for said freebie-tossing), so the bloodlust that can normally be traced to ADV's little area was not present, thankfully. There were, however, lots of expensive boxsets, including the aforementioned <em>RahXephon</em> boxset which was selling for about $20 more than I could have bought it for last year. Oh joy of joys!! I'm glad I only get into very few anime series.

When Solo and I left the exhibit hall for the first time, we went up to the 2nd floor of the convention center to see what was going on with AX Idol (AX Idol is basically Anime Expo's version of <em>American Idol</em>, only with just anime/video game/J-pop/J-whatever music being sung, of course). Almost immediately after we stepped off of the escalator, this girl popped out of nowhere and asked if she could take a picture with Solo. This is the result. Would you be able to resist his dashing good looks and obvious charm? I don't think so. Also, the ears might've had something to do with the lady's enthusiasm to take this picture.

I don't remember whether I took this picture when we first came up to the 2nd floor or on our way back down, but I guess that doesn't matter very much. Anyway, these two are cosplaying GIR and Gaz from <em>Invader Zim</em>. The Gaz getup is pretty good; however, the GIR costume honestly weirds me out a bit. It looks like a giant GIR plush toy came to life and became the underling of the Devil. And that isn't something that any of us really need in our lives.

I'm not exactly sure why Solo and I ended up not attending AX Idol (though I think that it's probably because Solo had a concert to get to in a while and he wanted to be sure that he'd get there on time), but we went back downstairs and into the exhibit hall. Appropriately, at one of the booths, perhaps in an attempt to upstage AX Idol, a karaoke contest was being held, and when we passed by two girls were doing a delightfully off-key version of ""I Will Always Love You,"" which I countered (not onstage of course) with my impersonation of Leavelle singing the same song in <em>The Simpsons</em>, if only because Leavelle's version is forever stuck in my head. I wish it weren't, because that is one scratchy singing voice, but it can't be helped.

Kind of a random picture that I honestly could not resist taking. Subtlety is a wonderful thing, isn't it? I have to say, though, that it at least seems as if these figures are making some small step towards realism: The two ladies in the foreground appear to be weighed down by their, er, ample assets, and if <em>you</em> had to carry those around all day, I'm sure that you'd enjoy a rest every so often. I know that I would. Also, it must be pretty toasty in that glass case, because boy can they not wait to get those shirts off!!

Unfortunately, after some more aimless wandering and random conversation (once again the best type of wandering and conversation), Solo had to leave so that he'd get to the concert at a decent time. I had a great time hanging out with him; he's a very friendly guy and even got me to not clam up, which is a miracle and a half, really lol. I bid a sad farewell to him and promised to greet him the next day if I saw him (unfortunately, I didn't see him, for those optimists among you). 

Afterwards, I took the opportunity to lay down in a relatively secluded area and rest a bit, because I'd been walking constantly for hours lol. It was sort of surreal staring at the roof of the convention center with all of the noise in the background and the random people in costume going to and fro. I felt like a new man following my rest, so I decided to go outside and snap a few more photos before venturing back into the exhibit hall.

The evening is when groups of cosplayers from different anime decide to join together and confuse me... or perhaps this group of people are all from the same anime, which would mean that they have successfully confused me. Bastards. I find that somewhat unlikely, though I have been wrong before (lots of times, as a matter of fact).

These people are all from <em>Ouran High School Host Club</em>, which I am only aware of because it was mentioned on the Anime Expo forums with some frequency. Nothing too special about this, except that our two friends near the bottom just might be sharing a special moment. Aww. And also the two hooded characters appear to be in the midst of a conflict in which the one on the left is backing down. Tsk tsk.

Every time I tried to get a decent picture of this guy people kept getting in the way, so this is the best I could do, unfortunately. This guy is obviously cosplaying Barret from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. I hope that the photo accurately conveys just how massive his gun is, because that thing was huge; he must've been pretty damn tired after dragging that around all day lol. Gigantic weapons were also among the things that were en vogue at AX 2006... earlier I had also seen a sword that was about 10-15 feet in length. Seriously, it was that large lol. If the guy carrying it had stretched out completely, the damn thing would have practically reached the second floor of the building. How one lugs something like that around with him all day is beyond me.

I ventured back into the Artists' Alley after hanging around outside, and I saw this pair upon my entry. The Anime Expo experience just isn't complete without lots of people with signs espousing their willingness to exchange glomps for certain favors (usually of the not-so-naughty variety). These two apparently had to knock down their asking price a bit, though I'm not exactly sure what they're asking for... do they want food? Or money? Or perhaps money with which to <em>buy</em> food? It's a total mystery; I'm stumped.

As I wandered through the Artists' Alley, the woman in the picture above called out to me, ""Hey, Mario!!"" either because of my shirt or because I might slightly resemble an Italian man. Probably more the former than the latter. She then showed me some of the buttons she was selling, including a mushroom button, which I agreed to buy because it looked kind of cool and didn't cost very much anyway. Because she had mistakenly run out of the buttons, however, she had to make another one, which I suppose makes my button special since I witnessed its creation. Ah, the joy of life. ;_;

DDR Man was situated near the entrance/exit of the Artists' Alley and he was there to maintain order, I think. I don't know how we would do that, however, since the sight of a giant walking DDR pad would likely further drive the attendees into a frenzy. The kids love their DDR, after all: In the words of my brother, ""He was probably danced on all day."" This picture took forever to get because people kept walking by whenever I would line up the shot. :(

I went once again back into the exhibit hall to check out some of the bigger booths that Solo and I had skipped over. Bandai's booth looks more or less the same as last year's, except with maybe a few more TVs and an area off to the side where people could play card games.

Geneon's booth also looks about the same as last year (complete with overpriced DVDs!!); however, they had a small area near the back of their booth where several musicians played some sets throughout the convention. I saw parts of one on Monday, but the place was far too crowded to be able to take a decent picture. 

As I was scouring Geneon's wares, a magic voice sounded off through the loudspeakers, informing everyone that it was almost 6:00 PM and thus time to leave the exhibit hall. Yes, I spent all of ten minutes in there before I was kicked out. Damn you, Anime Expo!! *shakes fist*

So it was with a heavy heart that I traveled back outside and spent the remainder of my time taking photos. I saw these two chaps at various points throughout the day, though this was the only decent opportunity that I had to immortalize them in photo form. It appears that these two creatures are going to be vanquished in battle, which is a shame, because they don't look like they can defend themselves too well, especially if they have to use their arms to hold up their tentacles.

I have no idea what the hell happened with this picture; the guy wasn't moving around and I don't think that I was moving around very much either. It just came out blurry, I guess.

I'm pretty sure that this costume is connected to <em>Hellsing</em>, but I'm not positive about that. Oh well. At any rate, it's still a neat costume, though it must have been a bitch to actually <em>go</em> anywhere in that thing. Just entering and exiting through doors must have been a complex task of the highest order. I'm sure that it's not exactly an air conditioned paradise in there, either.

She had an interesting way of making some money: As she explained, her offer was to kick her friend in the ass for twenty-five cents, teach me how to kick her friend's ass for fifty cents (as if I've never kicked anybody in the ass before; kicking people in the ass is practically a rite of passage here), and a glomp for fifty cents (which is a ripoff considering how many people were offering them for free, not that I ever took anyone up on that offer). I wasn't interested in what she was offering, but, just to see what she'd do, I asked what it would take for her to kick <em>my</em> ass, which she did not hesitate for even one second to do. She then asked for a quarter, which I obliged her to, even though it was really a sub-par kick.

But the more important thing is that I now know that I can charge people for the opportunity to kick me; I'll be able to retire to Palm Springs on Desbreko's tab alone. Huzzah for easy revenue!!

I'd say that this guy was my favorite cosplayer from the first day, partly because I wasn't expecting anyone to dress up as Willy Wonka. Regardless of that, this is still a pretty damn good costume, especially that kickass coat. I saw another Willy Wonka a few minutes later, but this Wonka is a much more accurate representation of Johnny Depp's rendition of Wonka, I think. For some reason, he creeped my sister out when I showed her this picture though lol.

Here's another favorite cosplayer of mine: iPod Man!! Amusingly enough, iPod Man's low battery appears to have made him exceptionally tired. However, that did not stop him from blaring out music at a loud volume while walking through the halls of the convention center. Personally, I think that iPod Man has a death wish and that this is his way of slowly, masochistically committing suicide. The poor devil.

More cosplayers attesting to the popularity of <em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</em> (these three ladies are costuming as Reno, Rufus, and Elena, respectively). Honestly, almost <em>every</em> <em>Final Fantasy</em> cosplayer I saw dressed up as a character from <em>FFVII</em> with the exception of a few <em>FFX</em> characters here and there and maybe a Squall or two. It's amazing how beloved <em>FFVII</em> remains even nearly ten years after its initial release. Maybe it's the crossdressing that appeals to everyone.

I managed to snap this photo <em>just</em> before Sephiroth ripped his sword from the guts of these poor <strike>dorks</strike> guys. The <em>Prince of Tennis</em> cosplayer at the far left ended up playing a somewhat prominent part in our day when I went to AX with my siblings and our friend Vincent on Monday.

Here's Aeris turning the tables on good ol' Sephiroth. It's quite obvious from this picture, however, why it's Aeris who ends up being killed and not Sephiroth; she can barely even hold on to the sword! Luckily for her, she seems to have caught Sephiroth during his nightly pray to Jesus when he is only aware of the Lord and registers nothing else happening around him.

These two are probably the only <em>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</em> cosplayers I've seen at Anime Expo (probably even the only non-anime [adult swim] characters I've seen cosplayed at AX). This picture took approximately eighty-seven days to take because of the sudden rush of people jumping in front of my camera before I could snap the photo. The Mooninites were not pleased, to say the least, and combined to unleash a rare Quad Glacier soon afterwards.

Last picture of the day. This guy wasn't an attendee; instead, he set up camp near the parking lot and treated everyone to a kickass show of drumming involving buckets and other assorted items. He really pulled out all of the stops with the drumming and was also doing some fancy flipping tricks with his drumsticks. According to him, the song he played was called ""Put Some Money In the Bucket,"" and I felt obligated to take the song's advice. Seriously, though, the show was fun as hell and very entertaining. A nice end to the day.

So that's about it for the first day. Like iPod Man, my batteries were in the red, and after a quick shower upon my arrival home, I flopped into bed to rest for a while before relating the wondrous stories, freebies, and pictures to my brother and sister. And then I fell asleep with dreams of the next day floating through my mind. How gloriously mundane!

Once again, I'll see you all in a few days. :)"

<lj-cut>

Anime Expo has come and gone, and I had a great two days. I tried to be a bit more discriminating when it came to taking pictures, so I have less than I did last year, but with a much higher ratio of awesome pictures-to-needless filler pictures. Also, unlike last year, there are in fact plenty of pictures from the big OB meeting on Sunday, so all of you guys and gals prepare to swoon madly (or not)! Anyway, there's plenty of stuff to post about, though I don't know where exactly I'll be cutting off this post; I'll just wing it, I guess.

Now without further adieu... <b>one nerd's recollection of the 15th Anime Expo</b>!! *cue epic drums*

AX officially started for everybody else on July 1st, as usual, but once again I elected not to attend the first day of the convention. I knew that picking up my pass and trying to get anywhere in general would be a nightmare, especially due to the fervor raised by CLAMP's arrival stateside for the convention, and later conversations proved me right. I attempted to view some of the festivities via AX's new experiment, <a href=""http://www.axbackstage.org/""> AX Backstage</a>, but the video was choppy as hell and wreaked havoc on my computer, which put a nice stop to my plans for the next half hour or so. Instead I just wasted time until I felt tired, whereupon I fell asleep and woke up the next day. Exciting!

When I woke up the next morning, I sort of lazed around a bit until I gathered my bearings enough to be able to eat breakfast without messing up my clothes. After I ate, I packed all of the things I needed to pack, made some food to eat later on in the day, and finished listing all of the mundane things I needed to do before I left. Oh, mundanity, how I love thee. Anyway, we actually took the freeway this year, so the car ride was shorter; my dad dropped me off in front of the convention center, but not before seeing a few cosplayers cross the street in front of us, which he basically reacted to like, ""Oh brother *rolls eyes*"" Haha.

Technically this is from last year, but the convention center looked much the same this year, so whatever. It's worth seeing again anyway - the Anaheim Convention Center is such a cool looking building; every year I'm impressed by how sharp it looks. Thankfully, it's also quite cool on the inside as well, haha. I'm sure that you'd read a ton of reports about cosplayers collapsing after walking around in the heat so much if the air conditioning weren't so miraculously awesome. Let us all take a moment to bow our collective heads in thanks for that wonderful piece of machinery.

Okay. Now for the real pictures!

There were a few people wandering around while I was on my way to the registration hall, and not many of them were cosplayers, oddly enough. As usual there were plenty of people dressing up as <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> characters, even moreso now due to the popularity of <em>Advent Children</em>. With the Aeris cosplayers, I don't know if I just have a horrible attention span and never noticed it before or they just started doing it this year, but most of them were actually carrying around flower baskets. As you can see in the above picture, this particular flower basket is sort of dinky lol. I saw a better one later, but I decided not to take a picture to spare you all from redundancy. Oh well! I'm sure all of you know what a good flower basket looks like, anyway.

These two were already posing for somebody else, so I decided to snap a quick picture of them for the hell of it... one of the few times during the convention that I took a picture without severe calculation beforehand (maybe). The costumes look pretty neat, though; I like the wings on the girl on the left. Well made wings were in vogue this year. I think. As were whips, as you can tell. Lots and lots of whips.

I braced myself for another long line ala last year, the registration process was actually quick and painless. I was impressed, actually. I don't know if it is because there were many less people registering on the second day (a strong possibility considering that CLAMP showed up the first day only and a shitload of people were expected to show up to try to get into their panel and autograph session) or if the SPJA were simply better organized than last year, or a combination of both, but it was nice to not have to wait in a long line to pick up my pass. Later on I heard from Panda, Solo, and <a href=""http://www.myotaku.com/Mamma_Vash""> Mamma Vash</a> that the lines for registration on Friday and Saturday were incredibly long (about a two-and-a-half hour wait), so maybe it's more the first option than the second one. Either way I spent a total of about two minutes waiting to get my pass. :P

After I picked up my pass I was also handed a big white bag full of freebies/goodies... guides, buttons, etc. Down the hall there was a guy sitting behind a desk waving his arms through the air and shouting for everyone passing by to pick up a bag from him on their way out; unfortunately for him, two other people were passing out bags a few yards ahead of him, so nobody was taking him up on his offer. He was pretty hyperactive, but I think that he was also very sad on the inside as well; he brightened up noticeably when someone actually <em>did</em> take a bag from him.

Upon receiving my bag of stuff, I went to the 2nd floor to attend the ""How Anime Comes to America"" panel, which was the only panel I ended up going to, despite my declaration that I would try to go more of them. I guess that one is technically more than none, eh? One the way there, I ran into this fellow, who cosplayed as the Japanese comedian <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Gay""> Hard Gay</a> (read about him yourself lol). I've not seen much of Hard Gay in action (nor do I plan to do so lol), but I had to take a picture of this guy. He made the effort to dress up like this, so why not?

This is your everyday, garden variety panel room with lots of uncomfortable chairs to sit on. I'm not exactly sure why the podium was in there, since the speaker did not even use it. I guess that it was for later on in the day when there would be more panelists in the room and an almighty moderator would be needed to unleash strict order into the room. And, as you can see, there are also plenty of flowers present: They're there so that the room will smell nice and fresh instead of like a room full of sweaty geeks (even though the panel took place at 10:00 AM).

The video screen was not used at all during the panel... it mostly existed in order to show off a few ads before the panel began and to run a series of amusing shorts. In these shorts, a scenario would be presented in which the person would need to use a particular phrase in Japanese; they're fun <em>and</em> educational! The first short was about accidentally dropping a cell phone in one's toilet (""I dropped the cell phone in the toilet""), the second was about a world class, train-dodging track who is about to die due to misjudging the speed of an oncoming train (""The bullet train is fast""), and the last short followed a man who fell into a vat of beer (""This beer is delicious""). Pretty amusing, though they repeated about three times each, so they got a bit annoying eventually.

(Substitute picture, since the picture I took was awful.) This is Lance Heiskell, the Senior Brand Manager at FUNimation, and he hosted the panel. He was actually pretty upbeat and funny, if a trifle condescending (I think that was completely unintentional, though, so it didn't annoy me too much), which made the panel a bit more enjoyable. Essentially, the journey for anime from Japan to the States is mostly made up of negotiation and translation - common sense, really. For some reason the translation process interested me because it is such a tedious process; the writers have to go through each line multiple times, making sure to keep track of time codes for every word, and when rewriting the script into English, they have to do it in such a way that the English lines match up with the original Japanese ""lip flapping."" It sounds like a long, hard, thankless nightmare lol.

After the panel finished I went back downstairs to the spot where I was supposed to meet up with everyone, and it did not take me long to find Panda and her husband, John. Post hugs and hearty handshakes, Panda was about to head into the exhibit hall, where Mamma Vash and Solo were waiting for us, but then I quickly told her that one Josh had messaged me the night before to inform me that he planned to meet up with us as well. A truly shocking development! 

As if on cue, almost literally right after I told Panda the news, Josh appeared with his friend Aaron, though I was hesitant to approach them at first. Seeing someone in person is obviously different from seeing the same person only in photos, so I didn't want to make an ass of myself by saying, ""Hey, Josh!"" only to find out that I had harrassed the wrong person. So, I was sort of inching back and forth, glancing over at him every few seconds, which he pretty obviously noticed lol. Then I decided that what I was doing was incredibly dumb and just went over to him, and he recognized me after a second or two, asked if I was Shinmaru, to which I of course answered, <strike>""Hell no!""</strike> ""Yes!"" and we were off to the races when Panda and John came over and introduced themselves to Josh and Aaron.

We went inside the exhibit hall and endured some awkward silences laced with bursts of conversation. Finding Solo and Mamma Vash right away amongst the hordes of people within proved to be a difficult task, so we instead spent some time marveling at the sheer size of the place and all of the crazy things one could buy at the booths (including the yaoi booth, which, as per usual, had a sizable crowd around it - and a banner colored with crayon!).

We thought that we might have the opportunity to meet Vic Mignogna (the voice actor who plays Edward Elric from <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>, among other roles), but, as you can see, we were just a bit too late getting to the line. Though our group was discouraged slightly, we pressed on bravely, adroitly evading the denizens of Anime Expo's exhibit hall who swarmed this way and that, cutting across paths every which way. We didn't exactly stop at any one booth in particular, though we did almost have an opportunity to go to the top of ADV's booth while they were doing their thing, which would have been hilarious considering how averse I am to them riling up the crowds of people, but alas, it was not meant to be, as only John was able to go up (he's a photographer).

After some more aimless wandering (the best kind of wandering, by the way), we ran into the young lady on the right, who Panda knew from the Cosplay.com forums. They both decided to dress up as this ultra-obscure character in order for it to be easier for them to find each other, which worked pretty well considering how often they ran into each other just while we were with Panda lol. They were the only two I saw who dressed up as this character, so they stood out a lot, haha.

This stand was on the outskirts of the exhibit hall. It's a display for <em>Azumi</em>, a 2003 adaptation of a manga of the same name that is coming to American theaters about three weeks from now. Apparently it's a pretty solid action flick, but I don't know if I'd see it in theaters (or even <em>could</em> see it, since I doubt it would appear anywhere near me).

Eventually we arrived at the Viz booth, where free bags were being given out, and Panda jumped in line while Josh went to get some food and drink. Panda then called up Mamma Vash and Solo and told them where we were, since we'd actually be in one place for a while and it'd be easy to find us. The wait was long and harsh, mostly because the freebies had yet to begin being handed out. We were fifteen minutes early. I wasn't really standing in line, so while we were waiting for our other friends to arrive, I hung around and took a couple of pictures.

These three ladies were posing at the nearby Geneon booth. I don't remember what they were supposed to be advertising; it may have been <em>Ergo Proxy</em>, but that is a sketchy guess at best. The woman on the left seems to have contracted a severe case of the giggles, which she may have received after accidentally peering over in the direction of the photographer.

This is the only V I saw, which surprised me a bit. The film adaptation is fairly popular, and even if people didn't like it, the release at least led to some renewed interest in the graphic novel (as evidenced by my reading it after the release of the film, haha). Anyway, this is a pretty cool costume, even if he's missing the Guy Fawkes hat and is instead wearing a watch. I guess that V would be unable to remember, remember the fifth of November were he to not have his trusty timepiece on hand (or on wrist).

Soon after this Mamma Vash and our dear, dear Solo arrived at the scene (Solo kind of snuck up on me). After I interrogated Solo for a few minutes about how his time in California had been up to that point (he was having a great time and was in awe at the American fascination with large stuff lol), Josh came back and he and Solo began talking. Then the line began moving, and, er, we all jumped in behind Panda. Yes, we're cutters; I'm so ashamed! Well, not really, since everyone in line got bags anyway. I'd maybe feel a bit guilty if a few people at the end were unable to snag the freebies.

The <em>Robotech</em> booth was our next stop and it became our hangout for the next half hour/hour or so. Panda introduced us to Dan Woren (who voiced Roy Fokker in <em>Robotech</em>, along with a ton of other voice acting roles), who ended up having a lengthy conversation with Solo, which is just as well because I can't imagine what I would have talked about with him lol. Then I started talking with Mamma Vash, who noticed that I'm from La Puente. My first thought was, ""Someone's heard of La Puente??"" and I asked if she had family there lol. However, she just has a solid knowledge of Californian cities and she knew from my area code after I had sent her my cell phone number that I lived somewhere close by Anaheim. So, yeah, La Puente is still not famous in any way, unless you make it a point to know where <em>Halloween: H20</em> was filmed. Anyway, she also showed me a great video she had captured on her camera showcasing Box Man - a cosplayer who hid under a box, waited for just the right moment, and then sprang out from under his boxy tomb. Haha. The strangest cosplayers are the best cosplayers.

I don't remember whether I took this picture before or after Solo began speaking to Dan Woren, but, uh, here he is! As you can see, the left ear on his head is drooping slightly, which became a running joke of sorts during the convention. Concerned citizens that they are, the fair folk of AX kept pointing out to Solo that his ear was down, and he eventually began explaining it away by saying that it was supposed to be like that. Also, you can see Josh and Aaron off to the left, and the bags that everyone is holding are the bags that we waited so patiently in line for earlier in the day. 

Panda was uber-busy at the <em>Robotech</em> booth, so I just took in the sights and sounds of the convention with Josh and Aaron. After a bit of talking, our eyes set upon the horror of the Vatti (I think that's what they were called anyway). I did not take a picture of them, so your eyes will be spared the horror. Just know that they were a group of guys who traveled around in briefs, shoes, and socks with leaves hanging over their crotches. Hopefully that didn't conjure up any traumatizing images for you guys and gals. After averting our vision and chatting a bit about my cosplay (I was dressed as a geek, which was a surprisingly popular costume choice at the convention; geek is chic at AX, who knew?), we heard loud rumblings over at ADV's booth. They were definitely tossing many a freebie to the restless crowd; it was the roar of free stuff for certain.

There was also a funny moment where Josh asked Aaron, ""So, is this all you expected it to be and more?"" to which Aaron simply answered, ""Yes."" The way he said it had Josh and I laughing, and he decided not to inquire any further lol. You never know what you're getting into when you dig through those ambiguous ""yes"" answers.

After Solo finished his conversation with Mr. Woren, we decided to head over to the Artists' Alley, and bid adieu to Panda, John, and Mamma Vash (who was especially nice even though I'd had zero contact with her up to that day). My one regret is that I did not get a picture with them. I wish I'd run into them later on in the day. Sadness. Anyway, I snapped the above picture on the way to the Artists' Alley. There were a <em>lot</em> of Pyramidhead cosplayers around this year, no doubt due to the popularity of the <em>Silent Hill</em> movie. These two were sort of tame compared to the Pyramidheads I ended up seeing later on.

The Artists' Alley thankfully had its own room this year; in 2005, the Alley was down on the bottom floor of the ACC and it was so unbelievably cramped and crowded down there lol. It was still pretty crowded this year but at least there was some maneuvering room. That picture is just a sample of some of the great artwork on display in there; I'm always impressed with people who can draw well, because I have no drawing talent of my own. Even my stick figures are horrendous. My favorite on display there is either the Harley Quinn drawing (because Harley Quinn rocks) or the <em>Nightmare Before Christmas</em> drawing on the bottom right. They're all pretty kickass though.

Following our excursion to the Artists' Alley, Solo wanted to go to the Gaming Room to see if we would be able to play a round or two of <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>. It sounded like a fair idea to the rest of us, so off we went! Since we'd spent the majority of the day indoors, it was bright as hell (and quite warm) when we went outside, and our attempts to protect ourselves from the dangers of natural light were mostly futile. But what does that matter when...

...there are pictures of Josh to be seen? :O! I've got one thing to say about this picture: If life were a film noir, then I'd be insanely suspicious of Josh. The shadows covering him from head to toe... the clearly sinister look on his face... and his arm is reaching for something, quite possibly a gun! However, life is <em>not</em> a film noir (fortunately or unfortunately, I don't know), so no harm at all came from this innocent picture. But it could have happened in an alternate reality... maybe.

When we arrived at the third floor of the Hilton, where the Gaming Room was, there were already a bunch of people huddled around <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, though by far the largest crowd was watching people play the latest version of <em>Guilty Gear</em>. With our hopes of playing <em>Smash Bros.</em> dashed for the moment, we sat down to take a rest.

This cooler provided some funny moments before Josh and Aaron had to leave. We were all pretty damn thirsty by the time we got up to the Gaming Room, but, of course, the cooler was empty. I suppose that provided the Gods of Cruelty with a few snickers. So instead we drank some tap water from the sink; perhaps that isn't the wisest choice to make in southern California, but we were thirsty, damn it. As we sat down to drink, more people began approaching the cooler and they became frustrated when no water came out. This one guy was shaking the cooler around and cursing up a storm, and it was very silly. An empty water cooler is annoying, but is it really enough to warrant a, ""Fucking fuck, where's the god damn water?? *shakes* Fuck!!!!!"" I don't think so.

Unfortunately, Josh and Aaron had to leave before an adequate number of openings for <em>Smash Bros.</em> appeared. However, I did not make the mistake of forgetting to take a group photo, so get ready to be dazzled, everyone:

From left to right: Aaron, Josh, me, and Solo. I don't know what happened, but I ended up balancing myself on the countertop, and it makes me look like Igor from <em>Young Frankenstein</em>. Luckily my hump is capable of switching places too. Anyway, I had a great time hanging out with Josh and Aaron. It was definitely a bit awkward at first, but it was also easier to become more comfortable with the situation because of similar experiences I've had before. So, yeah, Josh is pretty damn funny, which made breaking the ice a hell of a lot easier, <em>and</em> the world did not explode with boredom during our meeting, which is a big plus. Aaron was understandably quiet much of the time (I would be too in the same situation), but he was very nice when I talked with him. Like Solo, he was also in awe at how massive Anime Expo is. :P

Sorry everyone but the post ends here. Next time I promise a lot more pictures and tales of my travels around AX with Solo. Also, be sure visit everyone's myOtakus to get some more of the AX experience, because mine is but one limited perspective (plus there are bound to be lots more pictures and that is only a good thing).

See you all in a few days."

It doesn't have to be in any order, and you can choose characters from any medium, though I seem to have stuck with films for my list...

Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) - Amelie
Rita (Laura Harring) - Mulholland Dr.
Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) - Laura
Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) - Notorious
Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani) - Mallrats
Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelly) - Dark City
Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) - Lost in Translation
Clementine (Kate Winslet) - Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) - King Kong
Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) - Bonnie and Clyde

That was completely off the top of my head when I commented on Pyro's LJ... given more time to think, I'd probably have a different list, haha. For example, I should've had Sydney Bristow from Alias (Jennifer Garner) on there somewhere - she'd probably make this prestigious list over Charlotte, who seems to have fun only with older men. Hm.

Maybe I'll do another list or two later. I thought about doing a list of guys for the hell of it (my George Costanza, ""Now <i>that</i> is one handsome man!"" list), or even a list of the most disturbing characters with whom to have a roll in the hay.

Anyway, have at it everyone! :P"

Amongst the things that writer/director David Cronenberg is known for are his entries into the ""body horror"" genre of film. Body horror is just that - the horror comes from something that goes terribly wrong with the human body (mutation, degeneration, invasion by a foreign organism, etc.) or simply the fear that something is happening to one's body. Cronenberg's films are definitely at the head of the genre; it's easy to tell that he's just at home in body horror, and he <em>really</em> goes all out with these things. <em>Videodrome</em> is a great example of this.

<em>Videodrome</em> begins with Max Renn, the incredibly sleazy president of a local cable TV station who is eternally on the hunt for the one show that will shock and repulse enough people to secure him a decently sized audience. Max steals shows he picks up from signals originating all across the world, and he chooses only the seediest, most violent and sexually charged programming to fill his time slots. Obviously, he is a very controversial figure and even shows up on a talk show or two in order to defend the shows he chooses to put onto his network.

One day, one of Max's technical staff members picks up transmissions of an insanely violent show called ""Videodrome"" that is nothing but people being tortured and mutilated from start to finish, with no plot to speak of. Max is, of course, completely fascinated right away, realizing that ""Videodrome"" could be the show that helps his fledgling network hit the big time. Despite warnings from a friend that what ""Videodrome"" shows is actual torture and murder (""snuff TV"" as the film calls it), and that he could get in <em>huge</em> trouble if he airs the program, Max decides to go ahead and get in contact with the creators of the show.

Once he starts watching it more, however, Max starts to get second thoughts. His girlfriend, a masochistic woman who is bizarrely intrigued by the show, goes to audition and disappears. Before she left, Max began to have hallucinations, and these only intensify when she is gone; he imagines that the Betamax tape with ""Videodrome"" on it is pulsating, as is his television. Max gets a gun for protection, but a hole opens up in his stomach and then swallows the gun whole. Max is understandably freaked out by this and he desperately tries to find the makers of ""Videodrome,"" but he is subsequently sucked deeper and deeper into things beyond his command as he struggles to maintain control of his body and his slipping hold on reality.

First of all, you can't talk about this film (or many of Cronenberg's other films for that matter lol) without mentioning the special effects - they're fucking nuts. Not quite as wild as what you'll find in <em>The Fly</em>, but not that far off either. Besides the aforementioned holes in stomachs and pulsing televisions and Betamax tapes, there's also exploding body parts aplenty, mutations, and a very violent, grisly fate met by one of the characters that I couldn't help but watch a few times in a row. Unlike a lot of other movies where the effects are there just for the sake of being there, the special effects in this film really do add a lot to the whole experience. Unless you're <em>really</em> disturbed by effects of that nature, you'll never find yourself without something interesting to watch in <em>Videodrome</em>.

One thing that I think is explored effectively is our obsession with violence - hell, the fact that I watched that horrible death scene more than once is at least somewhat indictive of that obsession. Max is always on the hunt for the most violent show possible, because he believes that is the future of television. And, guess what, it gets him noticed. He's brought on to talk shows so that the hosts can condemn what he is doing, but he's still getting attention. Instead of turning people from Max's network, it more than likely draws more viewers to him. Then, when Max finally gets his hands on ""Videodrome,"" he becomes a complete slave to it, literally and figuratively. The thing drives him nuts but he can't stop watching it and listening to its suggestions, and it drives him to do things that even he would not have done without its influence. It's too much for him to ignore.

Another thing that I really like is the creepy, surreal mood of the whole thing. Obviously the visual effects go a long way towards establishing that. All of the nutty things that happen to Max and everybody else keep escalating, so there's always a feeling of, ""What the hell is going on here??"" The music also contributes well to the mood, though honestly it sometimes smacks way too much of the 80s lol (too much synth, etc.). I think that Max's reactions to everything also make <em>Videodrome</em> a bit more unnerving. At first the guy is like, ""WTF?"" just like anybody else would be... but eventually he grows so serious about and accepting of all of the crazy crap going on everywhere, and it's kind of unsettling. That's how it made me feel, anyway lol.

There are some points where the plot becomes really ambiguous, though probably deliberately so. After a certain point it's almost impossible to tell what is actually happening in reality and what is just a part of Max's hallucinations. It makes the story a bit confusing, but it works to show deep ""Videodrome"" has gotten into Max. It's pretty clear that the guy ceases to be himself the moment he enters the world of ""Videodrome."" The more into its world he becomes, the less he's able to actually control his own mind and the more prone he is to manipulation from others, especially those who are pulling ""Videodrome""'s strings. I'm sure that during the latter half of the film the guy barely knows where he is or what he's even doing, and the story sort of follows that line as well, not really stopping to answer questions to a certain degree. It works for me, but if you don't like ambiguity, then it probably won't work for you lol.

If you're into horror, then you should definitely give <em>Videodrome</em> a watch. It's a smart, creepy, violent film with fantastic special effects: What more could you ask for, really?"

Maybe the most frustrating thing about this film is that it actually does a lot of things right: It's visually stylish and sets a cool mood, the actors do a reasonably good job, and there are some good scenes here and there. But where Oldboy starts going wrong is after the first fifteen or so minutes when the story starts to really get going. After that, the movie's plot becomes almost too absurd for words and climaxes with what is possibly one of the flimsiest explanations for any evil scheme in the world ever. That's not hyperbole, by the way, as you shall soon see. Normally I try to avoid giving away spoilers, because I hate it when I have things spoiled for me beforehand, but I hope that you all will forgive me for deeming the spoilers necessary for mocking this pile of crap as much as possible.

The story begins with a Korean businessman, Oh Dae-su, who has been picked up by the police for being drunk and is hanging around the police station, bothering people. A friend comes to bail him out, and Dae-su leaves with him after first insulting the police. (Ladies and gentlemen: Your hero!!) Then, Dae-su's friend calls Dae-su's wife and tells her that he's bringing her husband home as soon as possible and that Dae-su has a present for his daugther's birthday (a pair of wings). While Dae-su's friend turns his back, however, Dae-su suddenly disappears. I hope for a minute that he's disappeared from the film, but alas, it is not meant to be.

In the next scene, we see Dae-su peeking out from under an opening for food; for the past couple of months, Dae-su has been held captive in some sort of cheap hotel room, his only contact with the outside world coming from the television. Whenever his captors need to come into the room to do something, or when Dae-su is being unruly, gas is released into the room to knock him out. If only we could be so lucky. Anyway, it is by watching the news that Dae-su learns that his wife has been murdered, his daughter placed under foster care, and that he has been charged with the crime. Naturally, this just about causes the poor guy to go mad and he spends the next fifteen years filling notebooks with details on all of the shitty things he's done in his life in order to figure out who would hate him enough to imprison him, using a metal chopstick he yoinked to dig a hole through the wall after his captors accidentally gave him an extra chopstick, and he also trains by shadow boxing and punching the wall of the room he's in until thick calluses form on his knuckles. It's like I always say: The best training in the world can only be found by being locked up in a shithole for fifteen years.

After fifteen years (the same fifteen years, not an extra fifteen years), Dae-su finally makes a decent sized hole in the wall but then finds that he is on the roof of a building, and that escape would be impossible. However, Dae-su then wakes up abruptly on the roof of a different building dressed in a suit with a wallet full of money, a cellphone, and his prison journals. While he's adjusting to the light (I imagine the effect is just like walking out of the theater after watching The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King), Dae-su sees a man standing on the roof of the building with his dog. Dae-su tries to speak to him, but because it's been so long since he last talked to a person, Dae-su has no idea how to react. Neither do I, really, but hey! We then learn that the guy is suicidal, and he says to Dae-su, ""Even though I'm no more than a beast, don't I have the right to live?"" He then follows this up by attempting to kill himself. Thanks for answering the question for us! Dae-su decides to save the man, however, because he wants to tell the man his story, while the guy is basically like ""WTF? Hello, don't you see me killing myself here??""

Following his story, Dae-su leaves the building, whereupon the guy finally jumps off the roof and dies after crashing down on top of a car. In retrospect, the guy was pretty lucky because he got out of the movie before anybody did. Smart guy. Dae-su wanders the streets, not knowing what the hell to do. He's attacked by a group of thugs and he beats the crap out of them rather easily, because fifteen years of shadow boxing is THE ULTIMATE TRAINING. Afterwards, Dae-su hits a sushi bar where he meets a girl named Mi-do, who serves Dae-su ""something alive,"" as per his request, which he then wolfs down. That scene must not have been any fun for the octopus, though, because I heard that they had to do it five times! You know, because we all want to see Dae-su eat a live octopus.

Just then Dae-su gets a call on his cellphone from a man named Lee Woo-jin, who claims to the omgbastardsonofabitch who locked Dae-su up for fifteen years. When Dae-su finishes the call, he faints FOR SOME PARTICULAR REASON WHICH HAS TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE FILM, and then Mi-do takes him home because she always takes home creepy looking guys who faint in her sushi bar. Apparently they grow a bit close (especially after Dae-su runs in on her when she's in the bathroom - no better ice breaker than that), and Mi-do offers to help Dae-su in his journey to determine just what the fuck has been happening to him for the past fifteen years.

The only clue that he has to go on is the taste of the dumplings he ate for fifteen years, and also that he saw the name ""Blue Dragon"" on a receipt fragment once, so Dae-su scours Chinese restaurants with ""Blue Dragon"" in their name to find out where these wtfassholeshitheads got their food. He is unsuccessful for a while and retreats to Mi-do's apartment, where Mi-do takes the opportunity to chat online for some reason. The person Mi-do is chatting with asks about Dae-su, which freaks Dae-su the hell out until he realizes that Mi-do has been (unknowingly) chatting with Woo-jiin. Dae-su then gets all grumpy, claiming that he can't trust Mi-do, and leaves. Afterwards, he <em>finally</em> locates the correct restaurant, ""Violet Blue Dragon,"" and follows the delivery boy on a call to the prison. Once there, Dae-su finds the prison manager, ties him up, and tortures him by ripping his teeth out with a claw hammer. Oh, that Dae-su, what a card. Eventually the manager spills the beans about some tape recordings that Woo-jin made, and after listening to one with his name on it, Dae-su learns that it <em>was</em> Woo-jin who had him locked up, though the only reason he gives is that, ""Oh Dae-su talks too much."" 

Dae-su is then jumped by yet another gang of thugs, who he beats off with his hammer (NOT LIKE THAT YOU SICKOS). The fight leaves him bloody, and Dae-su faints once again, this time in the middle of a street. A random guy off of the street helps Dae-su before he gets run over and transports him to a taxi. He tells the cabbie to take Dae-su to an apartment building and ""take care of him."" Dae-su then realizes that it is none other than Woo-jin who shoved him into the taxi. Wow, shock, surprise, scandal!! Dae-su wakes up in Mi-do's apartment and fumbles around a bit. In the meantime, somebody across the street is taking pictures of Dae-su AND I WONDER WHO IT IS - NOT. After shaking off the cobwebs, Dae-su visits an old friend of his who runs an Internet cafe, and the two of them hunt for more information. When the info hunting turns up jack shit, Dae-su gets another call from Woo-jin and is told to meet him in an apartment building.

Dae-su somehow restrains himself when he sees Woo-jin, and Woo-jin offers to play a game with Dae-su: Within the next five days, Dae-su must find out why all of this has happened to him, or else Mi-do will die. If Dae-su is successful, then Woo-jin will kill himself. Dae-su is then like ""Hellz yeah"" and he goes out to beat some more info out of some motherfuckers. Back in Mi-do's apartment, Dae-su is attacked by <em>yet another</em> gang (gangs must be really desperate for work in South Korea), who have already tied up Mi-do. The gang beats the crap out of Dae-su and threaten to remove his teeth with a pair of pliers. Ouch. Dae-su gets a creepy smile on his face when they try to do this, though, so they decide to just beat the crap out of him some more. That'll teach him to smile. Woo-jin's bodyguard then shows up to deliver some money to the gang. They take it, the gang leader kicks Dae-su a few times for good measure, and they all leave.

Dae-su drives around with Mi-do a bit and they reconcile. They then go to a random hotel and have a nice fuck. Um, yay? After this there is a creepy scene where the room is filled with gas and Woo-jin is in there for some reason with a gas mask on. He likes to watch, apparently, though he's a bit too late for that. When Dae-su wakes up, he finds a present on the table left by Woo-jin, which contains a rotting hand. Nice housewarming gift, Woo-jin. You're a hell of a guy. In the next scene, Dae-su figures out that he's been bugged by Woo-jin and has the bug removed from his shoe. He and Mi-do go back to the Internet cafe and trace Woo-jin's screen name, ""Evergreen,"" to Dae-su's old high school (this is where the plot <em>really</em> starts to make my brain hurt). 

Mi-do and Dae-su search through some old yearbooks and discovers that Woo-jin went to school with Dae-su. What a revelation!! Dae-su also notices that there are pictures missing of a girl in the yearbook and makes the connection that she died that year. He calls up his friend and asks about her, and his friend notes that her name is Soo-ah and that she was a complete whore in high school and died after drowning herself one day. While Dae-su's friend is busy besmirching the memory of Soo-ah, the camera pans to the left and reveals that none other than OMGWOO-JIN is sitting across from him. Woo-jin takes exception to what the guy is saying, kills him, reveals that Soo-ah is his (as in Woo-jin) sister, and rants that she was not a slut. Dae-su goes nuts, raging that he'll kill Woo-jin, and Woo-jin is like, ""Whatever"" and leaves.

For reasons I've yet to figure out, Dae-su and Mi-do go to a dentist, tie her up, and make a phone call. Apparently the head of the last gang who beat the shit out of Dae-su goes to this dentist or something. I have no idea. They go to an apartment similar to the one Dae-su was trapped in for fifteen years, and meet the gang leader there, a Mr. Park. He's been double-crossed by Woo-jin and left without a hand, so he's itching to get back at him. Park agrees to help Dae-su by keeping Mi-do safe in his apartment against her will while Dae-su goes out and does his thing. ""Doing his thing"" essentially equates to asking his old group of high school friends about crazy rumors relating to Soo-ah; Dae-su figures that she is the key to the whole thing, considering how pissed off Woo-jin seemed to get about her. 

After some poking, prodding, and general remembering, Dae-su has a long flashback to his last day at his old high school before he transferred to a different school. He talked with Soo-ah for a bit, trying to impress her by acting like a fucking idiot, but she basically blew him off and was like, ""Fuck this, I'm out of here."" The scene shifts to the inside of a classrom where Dae-su is busy writing a filthy message on the chalkboard; after standing around for a few moments, impressed with his oh so incredibly witty work, Dae-su notices Woo-jin running around outside and decides to follow him. Eventually Dae-su sees Woo-jin in the library with Soo-ah. They mess around a bit, Woo-jin takes a few pictures of Soo-ah, and then he slides off her panties... then she removes her bra... and then THEY HAVE REPEATED INCESTUAL RELATIONS ON THE TABLE WHILE DAE-SU WATCHES THEM.

...

Oh how I wish I were making that up. I really do. Soo-ah grabs a mirror to admire herself while her geeky little shit of a brother is giving her the time of her life, and then she notices somebody watching from outside the window. Dae-su is like, ""OH FUCK :O"" and runs the hell away. Before he leaves, though, Dae-su talks to his buddy from the Internet cafe and tells him about what he saw, warning him afterwards that, ""I'll kill you if you blab to anyone."" And, of course, the whole school ends up knowing about it, and the rumor grows out of proportion until it includes Soo-ah being pregnant with Woo-jin's son/nephew. It's not really clear whether this was actually true (not that I really gave a shit by this point), but Soo-ah ended up believing it, and, fearing public humiliation, she killed herself. OH THE DRAMA. Jesus Christ.

Dae-su talks to Mi-do some more and tells her the whole thing. She suggests ending everything then and there, but Dae-su says that he cannot do that - he must get revenge upon Woo-jin. You know and I know that this isn't going to end well, but Dae-su is all, ""Gonna kill me some Woo-jin!!"" and nobody is going to talk him out of it. Dae-su goes to the building where Woo-jin works and tries to go to Woo-jin's floor, but he's too stupid to figure out how (it involves some code or whatever that Dae-su got earlier in the film). Clearly amused by how dumb Dae-su is, Woo-jin walks into the elevator, pushes the buttons himself, and gives Dae-su a free ride to the top of the building. Dae-su mentions that Woo-jin screwed his sister, and, hilariously, Woo-jin looks around like, ""Who, me?"" He then suggests to Dae-su that they go upstairs and talk, which of course means that Dae-su is attacked by a couple of thugs as soon as he exits the elevator. After he dispatches them with relative ease, Woo-jin's bodyguard is finally like, ""Okay, we'll talk. Damn.""

In the next scene, Woo-jin is walking around naked for some reason, and Dae-su reiterates all that he has learned, and further insinuates that Woo-jin killed his sister and made it seem like a suicide. His evidence?? A picture of Soo-ah just before her death with the date of her death marked on it OMG!!!!! Woo-jin smirks and brushes off the charge. Dae-su also whines a bit because he believes that Woo-jin hypnotized him in order to make him forget what happened. Woo-jin also brushes that wack shit off, too, and tells Dae-su that he forgot only because it wasn't important to him. But then Woo-jin does admit to having someone hypnotize Dae-su and goes on a rambling speech about post-hypnotic suggestion. And then he reveals his grand scheme to the eventual horror of Dae-su (get good and ready for this contrived, bizarre nonsense):

Woo-jin had both Dae-su and Mi-do hypnotized, and planted suggestions in Dae-su's head that would lead him to the sushi bar where Mi-do worked. His next reaction was to be after the cellphone rang, where he would pick it up and immediately ask, ""Who are you?"" Mi-do was instructed to react to the man who said this and then to grab his hand. Dae-su's reaction to this would be to faint, whereupon Mi-do would take him home. Woo-jin's hope was that Dae-su and Mi-do would fall in love, which is exactly what happened. Woo-jin then says that Dae-su had been asking the wrong questions the entire time: He should've been asking ""Why did Woo-jin release me after fifteen years?"" rather than ""Why did Woo-jin imprison me?"" Dae-su obviously still hasn't figured things out, and though Woo-jin is of course enjoying this, he leads Dae-su's gaze to another purple present that is lying on his desk. Dae-su opens the present. He finds a photo album inside. As he flips through the photo album, it slowly dawns on him what Woo-jin's horrible, evil, disgusting, and just-plain-wrong plan was the entire time...

Yep, Mi-do is Dae-su's God damn DAUGHTER and good ol' Woo-jin got <em>them</em> to have incest as well. Dae-su is understandably horrified (as was I by this point, though more by the fact that somebody thought that this made for a good movie), and Woo-jin is standing around with a big shit-eaing grin on his face that just screams, ""HAHA @ U I MADE U FUCK UR DAUGHTER SCORE!!"" Woo-jin then informs Dae-su that there is a present over where Mi-do is, too (of course Park had been working for Woo-jin the whole time - he traded his hand for a house), and Dae-su begs Woo-jin not to tell Mi-do, even going so far as to cut off his tongue so that he'll never talk too much again. Since he has already gotten his revenge on Dae-su, and he really has no more reason to live (I could've told him that a long time ago), Woo-jin takes pity on Dae-su and decides not to tell. He then leaves Dae-su to listen to a tape that he made of Dae-su and Mi-do's vigorous lovemaking session. (I hope that's all Woo-jin used it for, by the way.)

(EDIT: Something else I forgot to mention here - according to Woo-jin, after he had Dae-su's wife killed, he then secretly raised Dae-su's daughter. How does Mi-do not recognize him?? More hypnosis, I guess. How terribly convenient.)

While riding down the elevator, Woo-jin has a flashback to the day Soo-ah died, shit happens, she's at peace, he's crying like a baby, she dies, and I don't even care anymore. GOD JUST END ALREADY. Woo-jin then obliges me by blowing his brains out after the elevator stops at the bottom of the building. The film then inexplicably shifts to a snowy landscape where we see Dae-su crawling around, miserable. He eventually finds the hypnotist who originally hypnotized he and Mi-do, and he begs her to help him forget all that had happened to him. She says that she originally was not going to help him, until she read the last sentence of a letter he had sent her: ""Even though I'm no more than a beast, don't I have the right to live?"" She says that she was touched by this (and not in the Woo-jin/Soo-ah sense of the phrase), and she agrees to relieve Dae-su of his horrible memory.

To do this, she uses hypnosis to split Dae-su into two personalities: A beast who remembers all this incestual nonsense, and regular old Dae-su who does not. The hypnotist says that the beast will age one year for every step that he takes; after seventy years, he will die. Dae-su then awaks in the snow, and of all people, Mi-do is there. Mi-do hugs him, telling him that she loves him, while Dae-su at first has a smile which slowly turns into a scowl. Did he really get hypnotized?? Does he still remember his night of glorious fucking with his daughter?? Are we really supposed to give two shits about any of this?? And that's the end of Oldboy.

Jesus, what a freaking awful movie. Ed Wood would have given his left testicle to come up with a story like that. Obviously Dae-su is supposed to be some sort of Oedipus-like tragic figure, but the whole plot is so random, far-fetched and rigoddamndiculous that the only tragic thing about the film is that it's tragically hilarious. I mean, when <em>I</em> start thinking that a plot is ridiculous to the point of insanity, then something must be seriously wrong, because I'll readily admit to have enjoyed some incredibly bizarre plots in my time. This is just way beyond that, though. In closing, I think that this is appropriate: Oh Dae-su? More like Oh Dae-SUCK HAHA DO YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE

Thank you and good night."

<b>Take 10 of your favorite movies and pick a quote from each one. See if your friends can guess the movie and when they do UNDERLINE(!) them.</b>

Should be fun, eh? Movie quotes in general are less obscure than music lyrics, so hopefully more than two will be guessed lol. I'll try to mix well known and more obscure movies here. :P

1. <u>""I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.""</u> - Guessed first by Quirky Chrysa (Dr. Strangelove)

"event","Lyrics game!

Step 1: Put your MP3 player or whatever on random.
Step 2: Post the first line from the first 15 songs that play, no matter how embarrassing.
Step 3: Post and let everyone you know guess what song and artist the lines come from.
Step 4: Strike out the songs when someone guesses correctly.
Step 5: Looking them up on Google or any other search engine is CHEATING!

So there we go. Fifteen songs, and I have no idea whether they will all be guessed or not... have fun all the same. :P

<lj-cut>

<strike>1. Got me a movie/I want you to know/Slicing up eyeballs/I want you to know/Girlie so groovy/I want you to know/Don't know about you/But I am un chien andalusia</strike>

2. High water risin' - risin' night and day/All the gold and silver are being stolen away/Big Joe Turner lookin' east and west/From the dark room of his mind

<strike>3. Can't get the stink off/He's been hanging around for days/Comes like a comet/Suckered you but not your friends/One day he'll get to you/And teach you how to be a holy cow</strike>

4. Spring has come/Worms are showing their faces/Little birds are eating them

5. What's there to live for?/Who needs the peace corps?

6. Is it asking too much to be given time/To know these songs and to sing them/Is it asking too much of my vacant smile/And my laugh and my lies that bring them

7. The world is my expense/The cost of my desire/Jesus blessed me with its future/And I protect it with fire

8. Well now don't you tell me to smile/You stick around I'll make it worth your while/Got numbers beyond what you can dial/Maybe it's because I'm so versatile

"event","Slow goings here lately (as evidenced by the lack of updates), but here's a movie post for you guys! I think that every movie post I've done so far has been about a comedy... lol.

Clue is living proof that not <em>all</em> films based upon board games are bad, though this is the only film adaptation of a board game that I know of (I'm still holding out hope for Hi Ho! Cherry-O, however). You wouldn't think that anything having to do with a board game would make for a good movie, but seeing as Clue is a board game about solving murders, it can be assumed that there is no way that anybody could screw that up. And it just so happens that it <em>wasn't</em> screwed up! There would have been murders-a-plenty had that not been the case...

The film begins with the butler, Wadsworth, making the final preparations before receiving guests for the evening. The guests are of course the characters from the board game, and Col. Mustard is the first to arrive, followed by Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, and Prof. Plum and Miss Scarlet, who arrive together after happening upon each other on the road. Each guest is immediately suspicious of the circumstances, as not only did they all get the same anonymous invitation, but it's also quite obvious that some of the guests know not only each other but some of the workers in the mansion as well.

Before things can get <em>too</em> interesting, however, Wadsworth scoots everyone off to dinner. After some initial hesitation, the guests begin chatting with each other and even divulge some personal information, even though the whole purpose of using pseudonyms is to keep their identities secret. Eventually the guests figure out that they are all connected to the government in some way, and Col. Mustard gets pissed off and demands that Wadsworth tell them just why the hell they're doing at the mansion. Just then, though, the doorbell rings, Wadsworth answers it, and in saunters Mr. Boddy, the owner of the mansion; the letters that each guest received all concerned their ""long-standing and painful financial [liabilities]"" with Mr. Boddy, and now that he is there, they can get down to business.

Everyone adjourns to the Study, though Mr. Boddy wusses out and tries to escape the mansion, only to find that there are vicious dogs guarding the exits. After he walks sullenly back into the room, Wadsworth finally reveals why they are all at the mansion: The guests have all been blackmailed for a long period of time, and Wadsworth reveals what they are all being blackmailed for so that there won't be any secrets amongst the group. One by one, in a funny sequence, Wadsworth airs their dirty laundry for all to know and see, until he at last gets to Mr. Boddy. What is Boddy's secret? He's the one who's been blackmailing them the entire time, of course! 

The guests are understandably pissed off at this revelation, and they all try to get a piece of Mr. Boddy. However, after he's had enough of being roughed up by everyone, Boddy tries to cut a deal with everyone: If one of them kills Wadsworth, then he won't tell the police about their illegal shenanigans; since Wadsworth has the key to the front door, they can just pack up and leave when they're done with him. If nobody kills Wadsworth, however, then Mr. Boddy swears that he will inform a shitload of newspapers about what they've all been up to, and he guarantees that they'll be all over the front pages. Boddy then opens up his case and passes out weapons to everyone to use on Wadsworth (rope, candlestick, revolver, knife, wrench, and lead pipe). He turns the lights off, someone gasps, a shot rings out, and when the lights come back on, Boddy is dead. So begins a string of murder and mayhem that'll end up very badly for a lot of people.

One thing I really like about the movie is that it has a lot of energy. I imagine that most the actors (especially Tim Curry lol) were dead tired a lot of the time while the filming was going on; there's just so much going on in many of the scenes, especially after the murders get started and everybody is frantic and on edge. People are often running around from room to room, tripping and falling down, being hit on the head by falling objects, attacking each other, flailing around in fright, and more. This is a fantastic movie to watch if you're a fan of great physical comedy.

The high energy of the actors also translates to the jokes, as well: Most of the puns are done in a rapid-fire style, which I think is the best way to tell the types of jokes you'll hear in Clue. They sneak up on you better if they're told quickly, and they're much funnier when you only have a split-second to think about them. I guess that there's always the danger that people will find the jokes corny, but I think that they stand up well (then again, I <em>love</em> puns to death, even lousy ones). Here's a particularly amusing example from the movie:

<b>Mrs. White: [My husband] didn't actually seem to like me very much; he had threatened to kill me in public.

Miss Scarlet: Why would he want to kill you in public?

Wadsworth: I think she meant he threatened, in public, to kill her.

Miss Scarlet: Oh.</b>

Come on, grammar jokes are funny! I think that taking a grammar class has helped me appreciate that joke (and similar jokes) all the more. XD

Perhaps the most interesting part of the movie is that it has multiple endings (three, in fact, though a fourth was supposedly filmed and then cut because it was thought to be too much of a downer). Upon the film's initial release, different theaters would play different versions of the movie, and you would have to go to three different theaters to see every version of the film. It's a cool concept, I think, but ultimately it was way too cumbersome and Clue didn't end up making much money in the theater. However, the movie became a cult hit when it was released on VHS, and all three endings are included on the VHS and DVDs of the film, thankfully (it would have been such bullshit if you would have had to buy three different versions of it on tape/DVD to get all of the endings lol). The endings are all pretty good (with the second one being my least favorite), though they probably create more plot holes than they resolve, haha.

As for the mystery itself, well, it's okay. Not exactly Sherlock Holmes-level stuff here, but it's entertaining enough and it's not as if the mystery has to carry the movie, anyway; the comedy does a great job of that on its own, and the mystery is mostly there to provide a scenario for the jokes. The mystery is basically constructed to remain open enough to allow for the three endings, so it's kind of difficult to sort through everything and actually solve the mystery for yourself. For me, the fun in the movie is much more in the jokes and characters than solving the mystery, anyway.

If you haven't seen Clue, then you should definitely give it a watch. It's on TV a lot, so there are plenty of opportunities to see it."

<lj-cut><center><a href=""http://www.sweethypocrisies.com/hosted/shinmaruzone/Marx/Duck_Soup.php"" onclick=""window.open('http://www.sweethypocrisies.com/hosted/shinmaruzone/Marx/Duck_Soup.php','popup','width=341,height=475,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false""><img src=""http://www.sweethypocrisies.com/hosted/shinmaruzone/Marx/Duck_Soup-thumb.jpg"" width=""255"" height=""356"" alt="""" /></a></center>

The Marx Brothers were one of the best (if not <em>the</em> best) comedy teams in history, and Duck Soup is arguably their greatest film. I've not seen every Marx Brothers film, unfortunately, but I <em>have</em> seen all of those that people generally count among the best of their work, and I would say that Duck Soup is definitely my favorite Marx Brothers movie (with Animal Crackers in a close second). 

Duck Soup begins with the nation of Freedonia on the verge of economic collapse; its people are becoming restless, and a revolution is almost assured. However, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), a wealthy dowager, offers $20 million to support Freedonia's government on the condition that a new leader is appointed to Freedonia. Enter Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx), the newly appointed dictator of Freedonia, who flirts like mad with Mrs. Teasdale when he learns that she is a widow with piles of money (mind, he does this right after insulting her for about five minutes straight). Trentino, the ambassador of the neighboring Sylvania, doesn't take too kindly to this; he had been planning to woo Mrs. Teasdale and marry her in order to get his hands on her inherited fortune.

In response to this, Trentino hires a seductive Latin dancer, Vera Marcal, to distract Firefly enough to allow Trentino to make the moves on Mrs. Teasdale. Trentino also hires two spies, Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinkie (Harpo Marx), to disgrace Firefly's administration and to discredit him with the people. Predictably, Chicolini and Pinkie bungle the job, switch back and forth between alliances with Trentino and Firefly, and somehow have enough time left over to harass a lemonade salesman. In the meantime, the already fragile relationship between Trentino and Firefly deteriorates to the point where the two declare war over Mrs. Teasdale. And, so, the battle between Freedonia and Sylvania rages on, and to the victor goes the spoils. 

Merely describing the plot of Duck Soup does not do it justice at all - the plot is relatively bare, yet there's so much going on in the movie. Duck Soup is <em>packed</em> with great one-liners, classic comedy sequences, hilarious songs, and sharp satire; so sharp, in fact, that Mussolini banned the film in Italy because of it. Duck Soup was the last film that the Marx Brothers did with Paramount, so they went as far as they possibly could with the unique style of humor that personified their Paramount films (as opposed to the movies they did with MGM, which mixed humor with romantic plots, non-comedic musical numbers, and clearer villains; personally, I prefer their Paramount movies by far, because they're much funnier). Everything that made the Marx Brothers great is played to the hilt in Duck Soup.

For example, there are lot more songs in the Marx Brothers' films post-Duck Soup, but none of them ever got anywhere near as funny as ""Just Wait 'Til I Get Through With It,"" where Firefly basically lays out his plans to be a repressive dictator, to abuse his power at every opportunity, and to send Freedonia into complete ruin. The song is absolutely hilarious, especially since it's sung in such an upbeat, happy tone. Evidently, Firefly could not be more pleased to have the opportunity to screw with Freedonia. Here are the lyrics to the song, for your enjoyment:

<b>These are the laws of my administration
No one's allowed to smoke
Or tell a dirty joke
And whistling is forbidden...
If chewing gum is chewed
The chewer is pursued.
And in the hoosegow hidden...
If any form of pleasure is exhibited
Report to me and it will be prohibited.
I'll put my foot down, so shall it be. 
This is the land of the free. 
The last man nearly ruined this place
He didn't know what to do with it
If you think this country's bad off now
Just wait 'til I get through with it
The country's taxes must be fixed
And I know what to do with it
If you think you're paying too much now
Just wait 'til I get through with it... 

I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair
I'm strictly on the up and up
So everyone beware
If anyone's caught taking graft
And I don't get my share
We stand 'em up against the wall
And pop goes the weasel. 

If any man should come between her husband and his bride
We find out which one she prefers
By letting her decide
If she prefers the other man
The husband steps outside
We stand 'em up against the wall
And pop goes the weasel.</b>

What a guy, eh?

Another classic (and completely nonsensical in the grand scheme of things) sequence involves Chico and Harpo pissing off a lemonade salesman for no real reason than the fact that they can. Chico and Harpo fight each other, then demonstrate the fight for the lemonade salesman by kicking him and cutting his pockets, and then Chico and Harpo keep switching hats with the salesman for a while. Reading it makes it sound only slightly amusing, but trust me, it's very, very funny when you actually see it in the movie. Seeing people become completely exasperated always cracks me up... that's probably why I love Kif so much in Futurama. It's just fun to make certain people become very angry. :)

Way later (and here's where I start going out of order lol) there's another short bit that always cracks me up: Firefly and Trentino are at each others' throats and ready to declare war, but Mrs. Teasdale has been working steadily to negotiate peace between the two. She finally convinces Trentino to speak with Firfely, and then she informs Firefly of this. He seems to be open to the possibility of peace, and thinks out loud to himself about it while Mrs. Teasdale goes to greet Trentino:

Firefly: I'd be unworthy of the high trust that's been placed in me if I didn't do everything in my power to keep our beloved Freedonia in peace with the world. I'd be only too happy to meet with Ambassador Trentino, and offer him on behalf of my country the right hand of good fellowship. And I feel sure he will accept this gesture in the spirit of which it is offered. But suppose he doesn't. A fine thing that'll be. I hold out my hand and he refuses to accept! That'll add a lot to my prestige, won't it? Me, the head of a country, snubbed by a forgein ambassador! Who does he think he is, that he can come here, and make a sap of me in front of all my people? Think of it - I hold out my hand and that hyena refuses to accept! Why, the cheap ball-pushing swine, he'll never get away with it I tell you, he'll never get away with it!
*Trentino enters and approaches Firefly*
Firefly: So, you refuse to shake hands with me, eh? 
*slaps Trentino with glove* 

So begins the war between Freedonia and Sylvania - that scene always gets me, haha.

And of course it's not possible to discuss Duck Soup without mentioning the greatness that is the mirror sequence. The set-up is simple: Pinkie and Chicolini have invaded Firefly's quarters in order to steal his war plans. While there the pair trap Firefly in his bathroom, dress up like Firefly (greaseprint mustache and all), and Pinkie procures the safe combination after a scene involving a few cases of mistaken identity. Pinkie sets off a rather loud alarm and panics; he ends up running into a mirror, breaking it into pieces. Firefly approaches the area where the mirror used to be and sees his ""reflection"" - Firefly then pulls out every stop to out Pinkie, but Pinkie is able to (mostly) follow Firefly's every movie. The jig is up eventually as Chicolini enters behind Pinkie after Pinkie and Firefly have finished circling each other and Firefly has given back the top hat that Pinkie had dropped onto the ground. The mirror scene is probably the most famous scene from Duck Soup.

There are more great scenes (including a hilarious courtroom scene and the actual war between Freedonia and Sylvania, in which Firefly utters a line that pissed off a ton of people at the time: ""You're a brave man. Go and break through the lines. And remember while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are.""), but I don't want to give away <em>everything</em> for people who haven't seen the film yet lol. Rest assured that Duck Soup (along with the rest of the Marx Brothers films!) is well worth watching. It's definitely one of the funniest movies of all time, for me.

Just one more thing before I end this post: I've written a lot about how great the Marx Brothers were (and they were very great), but I have to dole out some love for Mrs. Teasdale herself, Margaret Dumont. She was an amazing straight woman, the absolute <em>perfect</em> comic foil for Groucho Marx. Her reactions were always golden, whether she was glowing with pleasure at Groucho's shameless flirting or in a huff at one of the many insults Groucho threw her way. I'm delighted (yes, <em>delighted</em>) every time she shows up in a Marx Brothers film, because it means that there's going to be more hilarious interaction between her and Groucho; frankly, I could watch the two of them play off of each other all day and I wouldn't be bored at all. They were an awesome team.

Anyway, once again, watch Duck Soup: You'll be better off for it. And if you've already seen it, well, watch it again, damn it!! I've got an article to work on, so I'll catch all of you crazy kids later..."

"event","I'll be posting these random movie entries here for the benefit of Pyrophobic. I figure that you might be interested in reading them. :P

Anyway, on to the post. :D

I like to browse around <a href=""http://www.imdb.com""> IMDb</a> every so often. I rate movies, too, mostly for the hell of it and because it's the most convenient way to keep track of what I've watched. Usually I don't take much stock in IMDb ratings; simply being on the Internet basically skews the ratings to a certain demographic. Even so, however, sometimes I can't help but see a certain rating and think to myself, ""Man, why is [insert movie title here]'s rating so low? That's a good movie."" Then I run away from the computer and cry myself to sleep.

...okay, not really.

Anyway, I was randomly hopping about, and I happened to stop by the page for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928/""> Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</a>. I like the movie, and IMDb's users apparently do as well... a 6.6 is a pretty solid score for IMDb. Then I went over to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101452/""> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey</a>, and was saddened to see the less than stellar score. In the words of Ted: ""That was non-non-heinous."" Sure, sequels aren't as good as the originals much of the time, but Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the rare exceptions to that rule in my opinion. I'd say it's about the same quality as the original... maybe a bit lower (or even higher) depending on who you talk to.

So, I'll be going to bat for Bill and Ted right now. Enjoy, all fans of Bill and Ted (including <a href=""http://www.myotaku.com/john""> John!!</a>).

The film starts out innocuously enough: Rufus, the time traveler who helped out Bill and Ted oh so much in the first movie, is teaching a class in the utopian society that was the end result of the success of Bill and Ted's heavy metal band, Wyld Stallyns. However, there is one man who is not happy (there's always one guy who isn't happy)... namely, Chuck De Nomolos, who despises the utopian society. He takes the opportunity to seize the time-traveling phonebooth stationed in the middle of the room, and sends evil robot versions of Bill and Ted to kill the <em>real</em> Bill and Ted and sabotage their appearance at The Battle of the Bands.

Meanwhile, in the present, Bill and Ted are busy rehearsing with (and proposing to) the two princesses they ended up with at the end of their excellent adventure. Life couldn't be better for the two, but they soon come crashing down from their high. Bill and Ted get a visit from their evil alter-egos, who trick them into thinking that the two princesses want to quit the band (Bill and Ted believe the robots, because they think that the robots are actually their future selves coming to give them advice). Then, Evil Bill and Evil Ted drive Bill and Ted out to the desert, where they reveal their nefarious plan, march Bill and Ted up to a cliff, and shove them off. Bill and Ted die and are greeted by the Grim Reaper, who tells them that if they want to stop ""the evil usses,"" then they must defeat Death in a game for their lives.

Bill and Ted give Death a melvin and run away, so that they can think up another way to bring themselves back to life.

How could you <em>not</em> love a setup like that??

It's an incredibly silly premise, no doubt, but damned if it doesn't make for a fun, hilarious movie. Really, both Bill and Ted movies are actually well-written comedies. Yes, behind all of the 'dudes' and the 'usses' there are some very funny ideas and great lines and scenes (Death contemplating whether to exchange his traditional scythe for a gardening hoe is always good for a laugh). 

Speaking of Death... he's pretty damn funny in this movie. The scene where Bill and Ted finally challenge Death to a game is hilarious. It starts out ultra-serious, and then... Battleship lol. ""I totally knew he would put it in the J's, dude!"" Then there's Clue, electric football, and, finally, Twister. Such an awesome sequence. Besides that, a lot of the best Grim Reaper moments come from how exasperated Death is with Bill and Ted. (Like when Bill and Ted are trying to sneak into Heaven, and they make Death wear a dress after they mug a few other spirits.) They really give him a hard time... lol. For those of you who watch Futurama, Death is like the Kif to Bill and Ted's Zapp Brannigan (except that Bill and Ted aren't constantly horny like good ol' Zapp). 

And even though they're incredibly silly, I love the musician puns and general music-related humor in the Bill and Ted movies. It's not hard to predict that a reference to ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" is going to pop up somewhere, but it's still funny because Bill and Ted are so enthusiastic about it lol. (Like the great Iron Maiden joke from the first Bill and Ted film, haha.) I also enjoyed how disappointed Bill and Ted were when they first came to Hell and they found that it was not at all how album covers had depicted it. That's just the sort of weird observation you'd expect guys like Bill and Ted to make lol. 

The only thing that I would say brings down the movie is how dated it feels... the slang, the clothing, and the music all just scream 80s lol. The humor has aged fairly well, though. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey isn't exactly the funniest movie in history, but I think that it would surprise some people with how genuinely sharp and funny it is. Give it a shot if you haven't seen it - the movie's lowbrow for sure, but it's the funny kind of lowbrow. :)"

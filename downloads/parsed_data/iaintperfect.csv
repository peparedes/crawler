"event","<P>wow-camp could not get any worse-i'm to the point where i dont want to go back. 2 main things have pushed me over the edge:</P>
<P>1) the kids <STRONG>DONT</STRONG> listen to anyone! they never get quit talkin to hear the instructions which makes all the directors mad at us for not gettin them quiet-but we cant get them quiet b/c they wont listen! they never want to go where we're suppposed too-they run off if they dont want to do it &amp; i have to chase them down &amp; literally drag them back!! they fight w/ each other, cuss, yell at each other &amp; just completely disrespect everyone. today was the worst day&nbsp;we could possably have &amp; its only the 3rd day. yesterday the kids had so many fist fights i cant even begin to name them all. i'm just really frustrated w/ so many different things-ugh!</P>
<P>2) the workers-<STRONG>AHHHH</STRONG>!!! i love the girls, all of them are wonderful &amp; so fun! most of the guys are too-they are so nice &amp; really friendly ( i just met them last wed). the guys from gate city are so touchy &amp; so horny all the time. all they want to do is hook up w/ us. i cant tell u how many times this 1 worker, who i have NEVER met, has grabbed my butt today. i would&nbsp;see him do it &amp; turn around &amp; be like ""STOP"" &amp; he would get mad bc he said he didnt do it! they kept trying to hook me up w/ there friends &amp; ppl i have never met before would ask me to ""hook up"" w/ them.&nbsp;some of them say the nastiest things too.&nbsp;1 little boy james said to me, ""i know u, u gunna sleep w/ drew! u aint goin be watchin the movie, u &amp; drew goin be doin the dirty under the chairs!"" then he stared at my boobs &amp; goes ""oooo he goin like those!!"" he kept smakin me in the butt saying he wanted to be in my group, &amp; today he pulled the collar of my shirt like all the way down!&nbsp;this one guy really likes me &amp; he kept getting all the blk guys to ask me if i would ""hook up"" w/ him, which of course my answer was no, but he wouldnt give up. he picked me up again (like he did on monday), but this time wouldnt let me down-it really pissed me off b/c i had jsut had an entire convo w/ him tellin him that i didnt want to be picked up &amp; that i dont like that-&amp; he totally ignored me, told me my eyes were beautiful &amp; then picked me up &amp; carried me around the room! after that he was shocked that i was upset. i told his friends that i wasnt going to hook up w/ him bc he doesnt listen to me, he just does what he wants to do &amp; then he got all upset bc he was ""just playin."" in the car on the way home he asked if he made me upset &amp; i said yes &amp; then he got all upset &amp; looked all pathetic the whole way home. ugh-i'm just sick of them thinking about no other thing but getting in my pants-all of them! its just really discouraging when i'm trying to be there to minister to the kids but i have to worry about protectin myself from them. theyre jsut like the little kids, all they want to do is hang on me-i actually thought drew was james once b/c he got on my back when i was sitting down &amp; i was bout to flip him over &amp; start ticklin him &amp; i go ""James!!"" &amp; grabbed him &amp; drew was like, ""woah woah its me!!"" ugh-hopefully once they realize that we dont want to hook up w/ any of them they will leave us alone!</P>"

"event","<P>there is only 1 word to describe today=<STRONG>FRUSTRATING</STRONG>!!! actually i can think of alot of other words but id rather not sit &amp; list them all. it was the 1st day of Gate City Day Camp in the projects &amp; <STRONG>wow</STRONG>...these kids r wild! i'm working w/ the 6-7 yr olds in the morn &amp; 6-13 yr olds in the afternoons-its just really tiring &amp; aggrevating. these kids come from bad homes so they get <STRONG>no</STRONG> attention, thus they have <STRONG>no</STRONG> repsect! they dont listen to anyone, they do what they want to do. all they want to do is get on my back, sit in my lap, rub me (<FONT size=2>CONSTANTLY</FONT>!) &amp; play w/ my hair! for the 1st like 2 hrs it wasnt bad-it was fun-but then that just got old. i was getting so frustrated bc no one would pay attention or do what i asked them. it was really hot &amp; just drained all of my energy-not to mention everyone was complaining &amp; when i would try to be peppy &amp; get everyone excited the little tween girls&nbsp;would just make fun of me bc i was white! i've <STRONG>never</STRONG> been made fun of bc i was white! they mocked me&nbsp; &amp; the other girsls &amp; laughed at&nbsp;us when&nbsp;we tried to tell them to do something-it was jsut really discouraging-me &amp; the other girls were getting upset at alot of things.</P>
<P>not only was i getting frustrated w/ the lack of respect being shown-i felt like a piece of meat on display the <STRONG>whole</STRONG> day! i've never had more guys point at me &amp; blantantly talk about me right in front of me! they would ""accidentally"" bump into my boobs or ""accidentally"" grab my butt. 1 guy actually chased me down, picked me up, &amp; my legs were rapped around his waist &amp; his hands were grabbing my butt to hold me up-it was very awkward!! not to mention it was in the lunch room infront of everyone-adults &amp; all-&amp; all the kids were cheering him on! 1 guy told my little sis that she should break up w/ her boyfriends bc he&nbsp;wanted to ""do her."" </P>
<P>i have to go back again tom &amp; i'm excited but i'm i kinda nervous that its going to be just as bad as today. we're going on a fieldtrip to the movies so hopefully it wont be that bad! <STRONG>PLEASE</STRONG> pray for me-i really need these prayers!</P>"

"event","<P>so i went to see<U> Raising Hellen</U> tonight w/ cam &amp; katy &amp; tweens were everywhere!! this is what&nbsp;i discovered:</P>
<P><STRONG><U>Top 5 Things Tweens can do to Make Themselves a Little Less Annoying the in Movies:<BR></U></STRONG>1) if you insist on falling down the steps on purpose at the end of the movie, make sure your pants are up!!<BR>2) if you are going to announce something in the middle of the movies from the floor to your friend in the back row, make sure it is something a little more interesting than the fact that you got the popcorn!<BR>3) if you are going to try &amp; look cool by talking on ""your"" cellphone after the movie, make sure you dont say ""hey mom"" loud enough for the older people to hear you!<BR>4) if you are going to&nbsp;walk up on&nbsp;3 high school girls' asses&nbsp;halfway to thier cars, make sure they aren't talking about how annoying you were during the movie!<BR>5) &amp; last, if you must condon in ""tweenish"" behavior during the movie, <STRONG>PLEASE</STRONG> make sure your older sisters friends arent&nbsp;the recepiants of&nbsp;this obnoxious behavior!&nbsp;</P>
<P>so that is just a few of the aweful tween behavior that occured tonight that i had to advise other tweens against! ugh-i just keep telling myself they will grow up soon!!</P>"

<P>i dont understand how u can not like someone but then lead them on by meeting them everytime they call u-i just dont think its right. i'm sick of tagging along-for this past week i haven't gotten a chance to really just hang out w/ her-its mostly based around his calls or other ppl. ugh-&amp; i dont want her to like him-for certain reasons &amp; i wish this would just end! my parents make me come home so early that its just like, ""well lets hurry &amp; take kendall home &amp; then well go meet them..."" hopefully this will end soon.</P>"

<P>see i <STRONG>HATE</STRONG> shopping more than anything-i really do believe that if we each had our own personal hells that mine would be having to go shoppin &amp; then when i finally found something i liked i would have to take the ACT to determine if i got it or not..&amp; this process would continue forever!! so anyways-i was about to break down into tears b/c i couldnt find a solid black shirt to go w/ my skirts! i dont think anyone understands how fucking hard it is to find clothes that fit me right! let me jsut tell you about my awkward body type-i have a small frame (like small shoulders), huge boobs, large hips, no butt, &amp; short muscular&nbsp;legs (thank u dance team!) so basically low cut shirts look really skanky, knee length skirts make me look like i have kankles, shirts that i have to wear a strapless bra are uncomfy, pants w/ pockets too far apart make my butt look way too flat...&amp; the list continues! i have the most unusual figure &amp; shopping makes me want to cry everytime i go. &amp; once i was about to have a mental breakdown my mom made me go into yet another store. why do i have to have such horrible experiences-why cant i be one of those girls w/ the tiny little bodies that eat all they want &amp; nothing happens to them-everyone talks about how they wish they had big boobs but if they spent one day in my body i swear they would change their minds! so&nbsp;my whole experience was horrible but i did get 3 new skirts &amp; shirts so i guess its ok. </P>
<P>erin &amp; cam came &amp; picked me up &amp; we went to books-a-million &amp; walmart. walmart was so fun b/c we were just wandering around-they have the neatest stuff!!<BR>we went back to cams house &amp; we were sitting in the driveway w/ the music down (u know, cause we were blarin our black music all way home!) &amp; a HUGE mosquito flew in cams window &amp; she freaked out &amp; jumped out of the car-so me &amp; erin followed-screaming &amp; running &amp; such-then we look back &amp; the car is rolling down the driveway b/c cam forgot to put it in park!! so we went running after it &amp; i grabbed onto the back thinking that would stop it or something &amp; cam jumped in &amp; turned it off. we all collapsed on the driveway cracking up--i swear that was the funniest thing that has happened in a <STRONG>long</STRONG> time!</P>"

"event","<P>so today was good-but tonight sucked. i studied for APUSH 6 hrs today-i want to die, i think my head will explode. i realized how little i actually know for this test. study session during field day was fun-stringfellow is awesome-i dont want her to move next year!<BR>show choir drama cracks me up. not the drama itself, jsut that there's always so much of it. i'm sick of 1 certain person &amp; they just need to stop.</P>
<P>i'm also sick of the way i'm treated w/ one group of friends &amp; i think its just b/c i'm soo stressed out that things are really starting to bug me taht never really did, but tonight made me realize alot.&nbsp;i'm sick of being the 1 in the group that's constantly being made fun of &amp; the 1 that no one listens too. i feel like sometimes i'm only there to give them a laugh &amp; then they jsut dont care what i have to say. tonight they lied to me, &amp; i'm not mad at them, i'm mad about what&nbsp;they did &amp; i'm mad that they lied to me b/c it was jsut really really stupid, but it just adds to everything thats been going on. i'm so stressed that i jsut really didn't need to deal w/ something like that tonight but it happened anyway &amp; it makes me upset. it was really stupid &amp; they shouldn't have done it, but its not a big deal, its just the fact that i really didn't need more crap--ugh--i'm just sick of it all.</P>
<P>i need sleep-but i need to do my homework and study-ahhh i hate school!!</P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#000000>so i got to thinking last night after watching the oc....why cant we have amazingly hot guys here in the boro? seriously, i would be happy with seth, zach, or ryan. that just doesnt happen although that spiderman kiss would be nice. i thought it was super cool that seth had a ben folds five poster in his room. but im not a poser or anything that show is just addicting.</FONT></P>
<P>i am soo sick of school. 1) im sick of waking up every morning super early and trying to decide what to wear. only opening my drawers and closet to find nothing! i have no clothes. 2) i hate all of the wanna be preps at our school, actually our city basically. it seems to be that you need to buy 100 dollar pairs of jeans to be considered cool. i must see people wear every new pair of sevens, james, joes, hudsons, citizens. you name them they got them. but hey, i guess if you got the money feel free.. i myslef and broke along with my whole family who is thinking about another mortgage on the house JUST so we can go on a ski trip for spring break. I mean yea colorado would be awesome but why make our family more stressed out? 3) I HATE homework. why must we waste our life doing it? 7hrs of school AND then 3 hours of homework or more....hello what are our teachers smoking? well we know what mr koster and mr moore are..but geez everyone else. take a chill pill.</P>
<P>&nbsp; anyways. everything else is going pretty well. ballet is finally fun but that is probably because im not making a fool of myself anymore. lacrosse is going well too except half of our team quit. thats probably just because our coach knows nothing about the goddamn sport and she makes us run until we cough up a few lungs. but i think i will start which is always nice. our coach told me she thinks i could eventually play at another level...but yea im not so sure about the signing my four years of college away.

last weekend was really fun except for seeing million dollar baby again for the second weekend in the row and then being left at the movie theatre at 11. cool! i then saw romeo and juliet on saturday which made me throw up a little it was sooooo pathetic. afterwards we went to cheap seats though which was fun. jen and alli and I had fun trying to pick up some hot and not so hot college guys who were busy playing pool and drinking and smoking. the usual greensboro college guys. 

amy came to school the other day..i miss her soo much! she better come back to the day school.we need someone crazy like her. she got a super nice jeep too. 

on wednesday I had youth leadership greensboro. thankfully it was the best day yet, however, elizabeth and ashley decided to leave me at lunch so i got to hang out with sarah nudelman. she is sooo sweet! but michael was sick so i was partying it up all alone and our news 2 guide was a bitch...but check out this picture http://www.wfmynews2.com/insidewfmy/tour/leadership2_23.jpg

ok well class is about to be over...homecoming this weekend...im trying to lay off the whorishness...we will see how it works out...ahhhh."

<P>so- i was watching garden state the other day, wow. it is quite powerful and deep...very deep. i wonder if i am like the main character in it, on drugs all my life and being paralyzed from the real world. well that is probably not the case, but hey, concerta rocks i think. natalie portman is officially my hero...not only do i want to look like elisha cuthbert but also like natalie portman.</P>
<P>i also saw coach carter last night (with my family ashley!). it is amazing!! i highly recommend it. it enforces graduating high school and going on to college, not having children until you are ready, and doing something you love.....well i guess i suck at explaining movies and im probably ruining everything for yall. but go!</P>
<P>drumroll please.........I GOT MY LICENSE TODAY!!!!!! stay off the roads!</P>
<P>ok well time to pay attention to the funny dutch guy!</P>"

I found myself walking quite a bit though. anyways im in super pain right now and i cant feel my legs, arms, and especially feet (basically i am an abdominable snowman). i ran with ari who is visiting for the weekend, and the whole time he was just telling me ""pain is weakness leaving the body....you can do it!!!"" hmmm...never the less i was still crying and moaning and whining about my out of shape body. really i couldnt be in worser shape. i need to run everyday now to get in shape for lax...fun fun.

on a happier note::: it was an absolutly gorgeus run and today could not be any warmer and whats the date again? o yea..dec 31! wowsers. it is 65 degrees in the middle of winter. i couldnt be happier about that.

"event","yummy. actually i feel like a pregnant zebra again minus the black and white stripes. not only have i eaten 2 things of cookout cajun freedom fries and 2 glasses of pinkish lemonade, but i also have not worked out in forever. leigh and ashley choose to not inform me when they work out for lacrosse so i will be that tortoise chasing after the hare up and down the large field of never pulled weeds. gross image huh?

so last night my besties spent the night (sahar and leigh), we watched the stepford wives which couldnt be any weirder and we watched the girl next door which couldnt be any better. The stepford wives puzzled leigh and me and we couldnt help but think that all the people on earth are actually robots and are being controlled like in the sims. The acting was superb though and i enjoyed the celebs. The girl next door had many problems but it all turned out ok which made me happy. if i ever met a genie, my first wish would be to look like elisha cuthbert. one word to say: gorgeus. if only i wasnt a pregnant zebra then maybe i could at least have her body...haha joke.

sahar and i went to the mall tonight, however, it was dark outside and there were stalker cars blasting rap music surrounding us on 4 sides so we chose to just waste the gas and go back home to avoid actually being raped and becoming a truly pregnant zebra. which brings me to my next point. we also went to fleet plummer where i saw a girl working there who used to be in my ballet class, meaning that she is only a year older than me. she was pregnant and had an engagement ring on...sketch huh? i was completely weirded out. 

im bummed out. no plans for new years eve yet. all of my guy friends are at the beach. my girl friends are annoying (just kidding). yay! alrighty well my brother just walked in the door coming to visit all the way from the big apple."

"event","yay for that amazing song from sesame street was it? btw- i defintly just downloaded the sesame street theme song for my new ringer! woo hoo!

so im very depressed from today through new years..all of my friends are leaving me! well not girlfriends thankfully, but all of my guy friends are going to the beach, are in florida, or in delaware--coolio.

ok well my biff sahaaarr is coming over! im super pumped considering she was turning into rapunzel all locked up in her own little room. actually her room is the size of my upstairs, but that is another story. man, little sisters can get really annoying-entertaining though. especially when they are sitting on your lap and decide to name their butts after superheros (carmi named hers cat woman and gena named hers wonder woman...what should mine be called?)

isnt it sad that 2004 is almost over? this has been an amazing year and i am so not ready to grow up. maybe i will just become a lost boy in neverland, wouldnt that be fun? i have always wanted to fly. weeee... oooo some ugly girl just ringed the doorbell--oh wait that is the fairytale character i was thinking about!!!!!!! ciao!"

yay for my awkward poems. only at 2:30 in the morning. i mean honestly. brant hung out with ben folds today and listened to his new and unreleased album: WOWSERS. ben said that back seat driver knew what they were doing:: SCORE.

i was just watching a commercial for a workout machine..and honestly: i think those women are really men but their faces have been replaced with the women ones...you know like masculine bodies but yet women..ok i dont know if you are understanding me or not see as it is now 3..but really if i ever start to look like a he-she due to my excess workout routine (hahahaha thats a joke)....then please please please save me and make me wear prettty little bows! ok wow...my parents think i am going insane and need to stay on my medicine 24/7...cool beans."

first of all:: i have to go to my 3rd funeral in two weeks tomorrow! what the hell is up with that? the last one i went too, all i could think about was jessica. not looking forward to the one tomorrow. i then have to go see phil sil, who is the coolest bar/bat mitzvah tutor in the world. wait this doesnt sound right? i already had my bat mitzvah and yet i have to learn an entire torah portion..in HEBREW? i forgot how to read...i mean pocket pool (wow never again).

so anyways, besides the fact that i think i am a schizo, leigh and i went to the little four tonight. it wasnt little at all acually but considering that we are ugly teenage girls who have no friends, it seemed little cause noone talked to us...but yea we take NO pity.

leigh and i have been sitting here...at what time? oo yea thats right 3:13...oo cute..i love the double 3's there. but yea anyways, i have discovered tonight that leigh likes to talk to herself. ALOT. maybe she can join the schizo club with me and i. eww that was a stinker. ryan reynolds...what is there to say about ryan reynolds? oo yea well besides the fact that he is STUNNNING. no not just stunning. like every man on earth (with the exception of brad pitt, ben affleck, and tom cruise) should want to look just like him. ok yea..so im off to go explore what other neat tricks this live journal thingy mabobber can do. i hear it works wonders. toodle-oo!"

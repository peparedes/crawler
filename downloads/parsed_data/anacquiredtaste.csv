"event","Yea so today was not so good.  I got a really f'n bad progress report...but I am going to check with my teachers to see whats wrong.  So recently I've been very lonely, could explain why I am writing in a live journal that has no friends yet.  I just wrote a few poems and ate some dinner and now I'm in my dark cold room feeling sorry for myself.  Bleh.  So emo.  Oh well SOme Zep  should cure my illness.  Well I guess this is it.  Best to not go over board for no audience."

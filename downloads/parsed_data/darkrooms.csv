"event","Way the hell back in January, there was a meme going around challenging people to read 50 books during 2004 and blog about them. Well, I didn't blog about them, but as of today I've made it to 50. Woohoo! And one of them was <U>War and Peace</U>, which makes up for the fact that two of them were less than 50 pages long and a good chunk were children's lit. One thing I did notice is that I could've surpassed 50 easily, if not for a weird four-month period in the spring/summer where I could barely bring myself to read anything. School burnout, perhaps.

Since I didn't blog about them as I went, I'm doing it now, mostly because it'll be amusing to see how much I've forgotten about the earlier books already. 

<lj-cut text=""she was a january girl""><B>JANUARY</B>

1) Mil Millington - <i>Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About</i>

Internet sensation Mil Millington transforms his popular website into a popular novel. Mil's protagonist, Pel, is amusing and tragic and his relationship with his girlfriend is painfully antagonistic. The plot is ludicrous at times, and the witty banter between Pel and his lunchmates is sometimes strained in that ""it's always funnier to the people doing the talking"" way, but the rest of it is good. I read part of it while waiting at the DMV and it managed to make me forget I was waiting at the DMV, which can't be said for a lot of books (I'm looking at you, <i>Sound and the Fury</i>).

2) Dave Eggers - <i>You Shall Know Our Velocity!</i>

The first casualty of time's relentless march: I've mostly forgotten why I disliked this book. The protagonist (Jack? or was that his dead friend?)'s relationship with his friend Hand never went anywhere emotionally, and then the whole interlude in the middle where Hand says that the protagonist made up a bunch of shit and there never was a dead friend just annoyed the hell out of me. But other than that, I can only remember the premise, which still sounds like a good idea to me now. I do remember liking the title and then being annoyed when Eggers changed it to <i>Sacrament</i> or whatever.

3) Kristie Helms - <i>Dish It Up, Baby!</i>

Online diarist Kristie Helms publishes her first book, much of which was familiar to me because it was in her diary. Good writing style but a lack of well-defined secondary characters. I'm a whore for emotionally vibrant character interactions, apparently.

4) James Baldwin - <i>Go Tell It On The Mountain</i>

The first of many books that I read due to class requirements. My American Lit professor had a weird thing going on where he wouldn't bring up the author's biography in relation to the book (and not because he was analyzing them according to some strict anti-author literary theory, he just never brought it up), so I spent most of the book drawing private parallels between the book and the brief biography on Baldwin on the last few pages. My teacher also claimed that the book ends with the protagonist definitively choosing the religious way of life, and didn't seem to put much stock in the fact that the he was also in love with another boy within the church. That's a line between worlds that's very hard to walk.

5) Boethius - <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i>

Heh. My Chaucer professor made us read this, and all I remember is that Boethius enjoyed using an argument style called ""Only A Moron Would Disagree With The Conclusions I've Made."" 

6) J.D. Salinger - <i>Franny & Zooey</i>

Oh, Zooey, you delightful ass. You and Boethius would've gotten along great. I both love and hate the Glass family stories, because on the one hand they're well-written and enjoyable, but on the other hand the characters all tend toward smug assholishness.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""you're not beating me, february fourteen""><b>FEBRUARY</b>

7) L.M. Montgomery - <i>The Blue Castle</i>

This book has a surprisingly strong Internet following (it gets mentioned all the time at Fametracker and ChickLit), and I had already read a bunch by Montgomery, so I was disappointed when I didn't like this as much as everyone else seemed to. The beginning of the book is great - watching poor, mousy Valancy turn the tables on her stuffy, obnoxious family - but after she and her rebellious woodsman go off to their island, it's like fifty pages of nature description. I know Montgomery loves that kind of stuff, but I found it tedious. The ending of the book is like eight million soap opera endings combined into one, which is awesome. I don't know. I enjoyed it, but it will never knock the Emily series out of my steel fortress of regard.

8) Alice Walker - <i>The Color Purple</i>

I don't know what I expected this book to be like, but what the book actually <i>was</i> was surprisingly enjoyable, stylistically interesting, and (of course) painful. I've never seen the movie and now I'm not sure I want to - I don't know how they could capture the same story without the letters-to-God framework. 

9) Leonard Stern & Diane Robison - <i>A Martian Wouldn't Say That!</i>

One of the 50-pagers. Someone told my father that this was an amusing book on the inanity of television executives, so he bought it for 50 cents off of Half.com. Upon reading it, he handed it to me and said it wasn't worth the money. He was right.

And then months later, following on the heels of terrible trainwrecks of crushes - things that could've worked, things that didn't pan out, things that swelled and exploded - after all that, when your heart is like a deflated balloon, and you're pretty sure you don't <i>want</i> to love anyone anymore, no one's worth the hassle - then you see that person again, and you think

I have a paper that must be finished by 10 o'clock this morning. Ten page paper. I have a page and a half completed and seven and a half hours to go. Plus I have to edit. Ha! Editing! Laughter!

I was supposed to reply to a bunch of thesis proposals but I didn't. Oops. I can still do them tomorrow but it'll hardly be helpful as they're due Friday. Unless of course everyone is waiting until Thursday night to finish them, like I am. Oops.

My hair is unwashed, stringy, and unruly, as though at any moment it might gain muscular power and throttle the passerby. All my attempts to stick it under a hat have failed, as small tentaclelike strands keep emerging to caress my forehead and neck.

I potentially bombed a paper that was worth probably half my grade, because I took a soliloquy from <i>Paradise Lost</i> and compared it to all sorts of outlandish things, while completely ignoring the <i>almost exactly parallel soliloquy</i> seven books later. I did feel rather clever when I was writing it and I think most of the comparisons are still viable, but I have a feeling she's the sort of professor who would prefer hearing the big honking obvious as opposed to the weaker and more esoteric.

So by all accounts I should be hanging myself with my own hair at this point, screaming ""GOOD-BYE CRUEL WORLD etc!"" but instead I'm giddy. This is because I was stupid for the past six weeks, in an absolute terror over my thesis proposal and having to go convince an advisor that I was interesting and smart, and I didn't approach ANYONE to be my advisor until [mumble]yesterday[/mumble]. What with tomorrow being the last day of school, I was pretty sure I had just fucked myself upside down.

Instead I've found a professor who is by everyone's account the greatest guy in the world, AND he's in the middle of writing a paper on Thomas Wolfe, AND his subject dovetails with mine, AND he responded to my rather formal, uptight e-mail by making Bernard De Voto jokes. He sent along a copy of his current paper draft and offered up his services.

Dancing on the ceiling here. I had no idea that there was such a crushing void in my heart waiting to be filled by clever De Voto puns, but there you have it. Now all I want to do is go slam out the final draft of my proposal, only this pesky Romantic lit paper is worth some huge percentage of my grade, and while I like parallelism I don't think bombing two papers in three days is worth the pleasure that comes from symmetry.

Reading F. Scott Fitzgerald's <U>The Beautiful and Damned</U>, which is very engaging while simultaneously misogynistic as hell. Damn those women - those ugly, stupid, working-class, broken-down women! Fortunately the title seems to indicate the beautiful ones get their due as well, so at least he manages to condemn us all rather than let the odd one slip out unscathed.

Presumably Dr. Wilde is going to have a memorial ceremony sometime this month. There's going to be a bench. A Dr. Wilde Memorial Bench, where everyone can go and sit and think Dr. Wildean thoughts. He'd probably like it if we all sat around and talked about how insightful Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick was. Unfortunately all I remember about her is that she used far too many semi-colons within a single sentence. Several of her sentences were half a page long. She also made me feel guilty for acting so blase when people came out of the closet to me, except there's only been one incident in my life where someone actually ""came out of the closet"" to me, and everyone involved responded by crying and hugging and generally acting like a Lifetime movie. But secretly we all knew it anyway, so I guess we did Eve proud, in retrospect.

My odd fixation with and fondness for Disneyland will be the death of me. It occurred to me awhile back that Tate's hostility toward Disneyland meant that we could never share a true synergy of souls. It later occurred to me that I'm terribly maladjusted and pathetic. But still. There's something to be said for suspending your typical cynicism and letting your mind froth through a gaudy simulated reality. I mean, fuck, he watches Survivor, he has no excuse.

My TA tried to push us toward ""Sal is an unreliable narrator in that Kerouac doesn't really think all women are these idiotic breaded fucktoys.""

"event","I have a four-year-old cousin. He's towheaded and he doesn't mind very well -- when his mother says ""No!"" he hears ""Do whatever you want, you adorable little angel!"" He's been indoctrinated by his father to refer to drinks as ""beverages"" and he loves Star Wars more than life itself. Whenever we come to visit him, we stay at a hotel with a pool and a hot tub, and he'll totter in and out of both of them, composing blank verse about Yoda and Mace Windu. During our last trip, he spent a lot of time in the hot tub, splashing around with his Finding Nemo toys and chatting up the 40-year-old men on business trips. On one evening, I sat in the hot tub with him, retrieving the toys he'd drop and trying to prevent him from drowning. We were sharing the water with a 30-ish man attempting to read a book, one of those ""Learn MySQL in 24 hours!"" things.

For most of the night things went well. His fish would dive-bomb the bottom of the pool, and he'd shriek ""No! No! Don't pick them up!"" He would stare thoughtfully at the swirling vortex of water for a minute or two, and then he'd shriek ""Get them out! Get them out! They're drowning!""

By 9:30 I was well-prepared to just let them drown, so I told him it was time to get out and go home. The man was on hour 2 of his MySQL training and he smiled pleasantly at us as we felt along the bottom of the tub for stray fish. We piled them up on the edge of tub, and I stood up in the water to haul my cousin out.

He stood up in the water next to me, and cast me a friendly, pleasant look. ""Wait a minute,"" he said. He looked down and gave my right boob a poke. ""Now how did this get so fat?"" he demanded.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw the man bury his face in hour 2 of MySQL, and I grabbed my cousin under one arm and hauled him out of the tub. He didn't seem to mind that I didn't give him an answer, and when I put him down he toddled off happily toward his mother. I wrapped a towel securely around my shoulders and slunk back into the hotel.

In retrospect, I probably should've been happy that he didn't start poking at my thighs."

This is pretty obnoxious, when you consider that community colleges tend to serve a greater percentage of the economically disadvantaged, but, you know, the money's gotta come from somewhere.

Then, at the individual community college level, they're attempting to cut the programs and services for disabled students by about 53% in the next year. This is also pretty obnoxious, since disabled students have a harder time getting through college and have a much harder time finding employment later in life, but, you know, the money's gotta come from somewhere.

Got caught with my hand in the cookie jar, but I'm not feeling ashamed, I'm cool with it. You always get caught eventually. Gotta pay the piper. Otherwise he'll storm off, piping all the while, and presumably something terrible will happen. This analogy hearkens back to the days of yore, when piping wasn't music but terrible devil-candy, tempting children over cliff edges. These days it takes a little more effort to get kids over cliffs. Frankly at this point the analogy falls apart, there aren't any kids and there isn't any piper, there's just me and my hand in the cookie jar. Also there's no cookie jar. Really, there's just me.

<lj-cut text=""This is how it went:"">This is how it went:

I went inside the classroom and sat down. This was fine, this was good, if I had done anything else it would've looked weird. If I had gone into the classroom and thrown myself into the nearest semicircle of desks, I would have been escorted off the premises. I went inside and sat down, and I sat in my seat, my regular seat. This probably wasn't smart, but it didn't occur to me to sit anywhere else. I had my seat, it had always been my seat, for a whole fucking three months it had been my seat. I settled down and stared straight ahead.

There was a silky silence in my head, purposeful and smooth, all-encompassing. In front of me was the chalkboard, and the empty teacher's podium, and it was hardly a hook for the imagination. My eyes were itching to the left, my mind was thinking up rationalizations quicker than lightning - <i>who cares who cares it's not going to kill you to look it's just a desk for chrissakes</I> - and I needed to distract myself. The chamber of my conscious mind was muted and calm and I wanted it to stay that way, forever if possible. I looked down at the top of my own desk.

It was hardly a hook for the imagination, either, but I could feel my left eye getting twitchy and I hardly wanted to run through the implications of <i>that,</I> so my eyes wandered over the desktop. It was faux-wood, with a tacky-looking faux-grain, and someone had gouged a halfhearted JER into the upper right hand corner. I ran my fingers over it immediately, daring it to snag on my mind. How long ago had it been carved? Had I ever noticed it before? I closed my eyes and thought back, to sitting down in this seat, to sweeping books and paper and pencils across its surface, and in an instant the clear unsullied chamber of my mind filled with smoke. Sweeping books across its surface, over to the next desk, one desk to the left, one desk to left and straight on 'til morning. My head tilted automatically to the side and I snapped back to silence, letting the flesh of my fingers press and fill those carved lines. Who had carved it? A Jerry? Hell, it was California, a Jerri? Maybe a Jeremy. Maybe I was putting too much faith in the students of the past, running my fingers over an unfinished JERK OFF. I let each possibility soak through my ears and permeate through my brain, slowly and deliberately. My head was full of blankness, rapid-fire bursts of white noise, individual shafts of silence rubbing up against a million others, until it seemed to form a net across my mind, an enormous wall of not-sound. My eyes fell back to the desktop, faux-wood, faux-grain, even a goddamn fucking faux-knothole around the area where my elbow was supposed to rest. The door was opening in the corner of the room, students were streaming through the doorway, as well they should, it would've been weird any other way. My mind was smooth and featureless and empty.

The muscles twitched in my neck and I was looking at his desk, I was staring at it quite purposefully, as if I had been meaning to do it all along. It was empty and unremarkable. What was I expecting? It was a desk. Recently there had been a boy who sat in that desk, but the school had been around since the early seventies and there had probably been a million asses in that chair in the interim. For a moment I was staring and the silence held, it was the living embodiment of waterproof, soundproof, airtight.

And then it seemed to emerge from the depths of nowhere, the Obvious Fairy twirling her little wand, <i>heyo heyo girl you realize he's never going to be back?</i> And in an instant, an entirely inappropriate instant, what with the class and the students and the clock ticking insistently towards seven, grief supernovaed in my stomach, pinning me back in my chair. For a moment there was no air and in the next I could hear myself sucking it in, whispering between my teeth, and the sensation in my stomach was unreasonable, strong and wrong like a world briefly without gravity, indignation spiraling through my limbs to tease my fingertips, <i>how can he not come back? how is it possible that he will simply never be here again?</i> The world was a wide curve and he was gone from the whole sprawling lot of it, left to linger in untrustworthy memory, and I was breathing, I could hear it, as loud as a truck, wheezing, <I>how the hell does this world work, anyway?</i> How could there be millions of years of painstaking construction, calculated mutation, and three months of him breathing and then not-breathing and somehow the whole world is ending, it's all brilliant shards in the heavy pocket of my stomach? I closed my eyes and fought for white-noise, fought for the edges of the desk, wrapping my fingers around faux-wood and the cold metal tubing that connected seat to floor. The door was opening and closing dimly on the other side of my eyelids, and it seemed like I was going to fuck it up royally, I was going to lose it entirely, I was going to spend the rest of the class fighting for breath and clinging to the desk like a refugee on a piece of driftwood.

This is how it went:

I opened my eyes. He was dead, did you know that? He wasn't going to be toddling back for more. The classroom was getting full. It was a class that everyone liked to take - they'd glance over the description in the catalog and think <i>oh yeah, easy A</i> and pile into the room. I pulled breath in through dry lips, through my nose, and a group of girls squeezed past the growing crowd and congregated in the empty desks in the front left of the room. A girl with impeccable hair and porcelain foundation slid into the seat to my left, letting her purse and cellphone and keychain tumble onto the desk. She continued talking to her friends, laughing, her back to me, and as quietly and efficiently as a switch being flipped, the sensation in my stomach disappeared.

For another moment there was no air, or rather there was far too much, my empty stomach and mouth filled with it for lack of anything else. Then a reassuring flush of white-noise, several thick coats of silence, the empty chamber of my mind, and I was fine. My breathing slowed. I found my hands resting quietly on the desk in front of me, knuckles still faintly red. I rubbed them gently as the door opened and closed, as students crawled through the crowds to fill up the room with noise.

I was fine. He was dead, did you know? Occasionally I forget that it happens every goddamn day."

So, after deriving much enjoyment from <lj user=""dayone"">'s zine <lj user=""heart_vs_brain"">, I've decided that I want to create a zine, too. I've been prepping a story in my head for the past month and a half, a little yarn of Tate-closure, but I just realized that I want something tangible. I want something I can print, staple, and then shove in a closet to forget until I'm thirty.

So that's my plan for this weekend. Lynd is in New York, J is in Northern California, and for the first time in a long time, I'm really alone. The fragile support system sprawled across the country like a deck of cards. Now my life is sleeping through Sociology, dancing through Philosophy, trying not to humiliate myself at work and experiencing some truly odd flirtation in Spanish class. Dammit, last week I was all ""No love! Philosophy!"" and now I'm showing up twice a week to suavity of astronomical proportions. ""You have a beautiful name,"" he said. ""I love saying it aloud."" My Flirt-to-English dictionary might be a little out of date, but I think that translates to ""Hey, we're roughly the same age, how about some sexual intercourse?""

It seems I desire sincerity when faced with suaveness, and suaveness when faced with sincerity. Perhaps I'll go read that biography on Camus and gouge my eyes out with a metal spike.

"event","4.6 earthquake in Yorba Linda! I took it as a sign from God not to go to bed tonight.

Back when we lived in Yorba Linda, we got an official letter from some government somebody telling us that we had an earthquake fault-line going smack dab through our backyard. I'd like to think that tonight's earthquake took place on that very fault. Perhaps my childhood home was swallowed whole by the wrathful earth! Probably not, though, since my house was only four miles away from the epicenter and all that happened here involved flimsy glass trinkets falling off of bookshelves.

Stupid non-wrathful earth. It's gonna be a long day."

"event","She spends most of her time dripping down various bays, keeping close to the sand banks and away from the high-tide line. Somewhere along the way she had developed a fear of the tides and the moon, a justified wariness of the riptide. It is the water that compels her, but it is the water she avoids at all costs. Once bitten, a million times shy, when you're dealing with a power that can break your spine, squeeze your lungs shut.

<lj-cut text=""i don't have tuberculosis, i have a job! w00t!"">My life has just been swallowed up by school. Here at 8 in the morning, gone at 3 in the afternoon, back again for more at 7 at night. All my computer time is spent here in the lab. But, on the bright side, I'm now officially a school employee, which means I get a staff parking pass and my own official notebook and an earnest-sounding title and some money. I think that last one is my favorite.</lj-cut>"

"event","It would be silly of me to say that Tate's ghost lingers all over the campus, right? I keep expecting to see him among the crowds of students, all trim and blond and twitching eyebrows. I have half an hour between my Sociology class and my tutoring job, so I sat outside with the smokers and wrote pointless nothings in my notebook. Dr. Wilde was hurrying from building to building, too busy to slow down, so he swung down the pathway, called <I>""Brooke!""</I> and disappeared around the bend. I yelled a hello back and grinned at my paper for five minutes, because honestly, the man makes me happy.

My Sociology teacher remembered me from the honors' conference last spring.  Tate had taken his class last semester, and one afternoon the class discussion moved to the conference. ""He was talking about the presentation you gave,"" Tate said. ""He said 'That's a girl who no longer needs to be taught.'""

Naturally I'm taking one of his classes now. Just to prove him wrong.

And meanwhile I've talked so much that my throat hurts. I've seen and smiled and laughed and nodded. I've exhausted myself, and this is only day one.

I miss him. I wish I didn't, but I do."

All I want is a boy who will rescue me if I'm kidnapped by an ancient sect of time-traveling Druids. You'd think I was demanding he perform neurosurgery or something."

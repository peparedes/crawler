"event","mmmkay ! I had a fun weekend XD 
 First on Saturday night I went and hung out at Sparkles with Kelly,Lindsay, and Ashton. Soo fun.xD Kelly called me at like 6:30 and was like ""Get your ass down here,we're surrounded by annoying preppy people and they're playing crappy music!"" So down there I went. I didn't actually go skating,but still had fun.  We played a bunch of arcade games and then played Laser Tag. Unfortunately our team lost cuz we had a bunch of lil kids on our team.And the other side had one of the guys working there playing with them ! (RECOUNT !) We got them to play Shakira's Hips Dont Lie and we all danced for a bit.We generally had a good time.. *nods*wanna do it again but with a bigger group of ppl.

Then on Sunday My mom and I picked Kelly up at Martins where she workds now,and she dropped us off at Regal 22 on the EW Connecter and we saw You Me And Dupree.xD She made me try a drink from Smoothie King..Not too bad. We also hung out at CJ Games for a bit. Saw Tripodie(Shawn, and no not Tiffy's shawn) we also saw Randal and Boberts Brother..who I cant remember his name for the life of me right now..>< I know he used to be Millies BF ( Who I found out moved to South Dakota recently) I found out that they're still hiring up there so sometime this week after 5 I have to go up there and fill out an application. w00tage for the job hunting again.

And then today I went to Acworth Beach with my mom,sis and her two kids.My aunt kathy was already up there with my cousins timmy and brandon and my nephews Marcus and Skyler. We had lots of fun playing,although I didn't plan on getting in the water..which I did.XD but the downside of that..*whines and points to her shoulders* I Gots Sunburn !!! It huuuurts and that crappy Aloe gel stuff doesnt work >< But still.I had fun ! I wanna do it again,this time with sunscreen..*nod nod*"

As much as I hate needles..The thought of having diabetes or PCOS makes it seem even worse... I know I should get this done for my health, to make sure if there is anything wrong with me that it gets fixed sooner rather than later.  But just thinking of my grandmother and her diabetes... She had to give herself insulin shots every day. She had to check her blood sugar every day,which meant she had to stick her fingertips for blood samples... I dont want that to be me...

I mean, its bad enough being 17 and overweight in this day's society. Im depressed enough as it is..Now for some doctor to say theres a chance i could have diabetes...God i hope I dont have it..I hope I get lucky and Don't have it.."

God i fucking hate when ppl do that..

Okay, the person that was originally going with my sister and her friend to the concert apparently couldnt go, so I got to go in his place. 

Then, they call back AFTER I was ready to go and everything and said that He could go after all. That REALLY Pisses me off..If you promise someone that they can go with you somewhere because someone else cancelled,Then they should be able to go with you !!It doesn't matter if the first person calls back and says they can make it,because then its basically blowing off someone else who wanted to go but never had the chance.

I've never been to a concert before, and even though Aerosmith isn't one of my all time favorite bands,I really wanted to go because the seats were really good and I didnt think I'd ever get another chance for a concert again because I am never lucky enough to win tickets over the radio and I never have the money to buy them(besides,they sell out so quickly anyhow.)

This really pisses me off.They knew i wanted to go really badly."

I really don't know if I'm going to make it through this semester..I really don't.
I've got Two Lit classes, british lit and world lit. Do you know how heavy those books are ??? And I have them on the same Friggen DAY !!!

Not joking...

Seriously. 

I don't think I'm kidding when I say that I might have a serious mental breakdown sometime this semester. All this work is going to kill me..I can already tell.
 Drama was the only thing that kept me going at school, It was the only part of my day (aside from German class) that kept me interested in school. I really don't know what to do..

Friday Night I saw Hp4 all by myself cuz I was boreded and I hate being at home on Fridays..lol..It was great, except that the theater was PACKED and i had to sit next to some guy i didn't even know..but it was ok cause I'll talk to just about neone..^_^ 

Then Round about 11ish on Saturday Ally and Piper called meh and asked if i wanted to go see it with them and i was like ""Hell ya..i'll go "" ^_^ So i saw it a second time with Bobby and Ally and Piper. It was much better cause we got seats in the back like normal, cuz friday i had to get a seat like, in the third row from the front..ugh..>.< 
But it was sooo much funness ^_^  Then we couldnt stay at the mall for long cause Piper had to take Bobby to work and he works at Captain D's..er,he used to. i think he quit sunday..^_^  

But anyways.. We were trying to drive through Villa Rica or something and we got lost..^_^ We went down this loooooong road and i convinced Piper to swerve through a set of them like you see on the tv commercials for cars.Then when we finally turned around There was this truck and guy was picking up the cones,ruining our fun.So we went around him cuz he was slower than Christmas..^_^ 

Piper was going like 50 and she opened the door and knocked down a few of them.Then me and Ally wanted to steal one.. ^_^ I really wanted one too..But by the time we had gotten turned around the guy had picked them all up...>.<

Then sunday I watched Cold Mountain for the first time...wow it was long but really good...And no i will not spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it (coughAllycough)but it is sad..but really really good..Not to mention you get to see Jude laws butt..^_^ there is nudity,so no little kiddies need to watch it.. lol 

But still..It was a pretty Good weekend for me..although im pretty sure im gettin sick..-_-...anywho..

<img
src=""http://live.quizilla.com/user_images/P/PainfulBliss/1117238538_Power_Fly.JPG""><br><b>Your power is:</b> The ability to fly
<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> This powers speaks pretty<br>much for itself. Though you don't need wings<br>for this power,you can fly anyway. Some people<br>may consider it as telekinesis since they can<br>also fly, but you can't make material things<br>move like they can. This ability could be a<br>relaxing activity when you want to get away<br>from everyday troubles. Also it is good when<br>sneaking upon an enemy since it makes no sound.<br>When going over to the ""dark side""<br>the power could be used to harrass and break<br>into building through windows etc.<br>You are quite similar to this power since you<br>like to have your head in the clouds.<br>Supernatural things amuse while ordinary life<br>does not. If your daydreaming has gotten a<br>little too far you might be zooned out all the<br>time, even when you are having a conversation.<br>Your desires and/or goals tend to be<br>unrealistic even if you know those would<br>probably never happen. Travelling is something<br>you would be interested in doing since seeing<br>exotic scenery fits with your fantasies of<br>escaping your plain life. You can also have<br>some creative ability (writer, playing an<br>instrumen etc) that interests you.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> The whole reason you<br>may be escaping life could be fear of being let<br>down by it. So if that would come to happen,<br>and an important dream had been crushed you<br>could get depressed.</p>

That last bit is definately me...I really do fear being let down by life...god..now its making me cry.Cuz thats so true about me...I really wish I could fly, if only to get away from everything, even if its only for a little while"

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Three men trying to steal fuel from a New Zealand farm Monday ended up setting fire to their own car.
Police said the trio had siphoned diesel into a petrol-driven vehicle. When their car would not start, they examined the fuel pipe using a cigarette lighter.

One click, a boom and the car burst into flames.

""It wasn't a major whodunnit,"" senior sergeant Ross Gilbert told Reuters, from the small North Island town of Waipukurau, about 140 miles northeast of Wellington.

""Fortunately for them, there is no criminal charge for stupidity.""

The men, aged 18 to 19, escaped injury but were charged with theft.


I just love that one quote though,,""fortunately for them there is no criminal charge for stupidity.""..im gonna use that one now. *does little copyright thing* Mine biotches !!!

"event","Not many of my friends have been over at my house..But those of you who have will probably remember my bird Bo...Hes a grey and white cockatiel...Or was.....He's gone..He died this afternoon around 3:30.I knew he wasnt going to make it through today So i just sat and held him until he went...I put him in one of my grandfathers old hankercheifs and wrapped that up with some orange lace that i got from my grandmothers craft box.Orange was her favorite color,so i thought it was appropriate...I buried him out in the back yard...



Ive known that bird since i was born.......Its just never going to be the same without him around... I mean i knew he was old but I just didnt think he would go so soon..But one day he just stopped whistling and squaking.Then a few days ago he would just lay in the bottom of the cage..And when  i took him out of his cage this morning, he didn't even try to bite me like he used to do..Normally he would have tried to bite at my fingers and make a racket..but today he just sat there staring...



But hes not hurting anymore..And thats what matters..."

IWANT THE OLD TORRID BACK DAMNIT ...and then i had to wait in line to try them on..i was waiting for i know over 30 minutes. >.<....and then i bought this cute jean jacket from Fashion Bug.I also got some shirts from HotTopic..the one i really love says 'sarcasm, it beats killing people' I also got this really cute reddish skirt at walmart,and i want to go back and find a nice top to go with it..preferably something light colored with short sleeves (damn them and no tank tops at school) that way i can have a nice outfit for the first day


Oh and I also dyed my hair black again today..And I want to get it trimmed a few inches before next wednesday..I'm thinking of keeping it at shoulders length for a while,I get annoyed sometimes when I let my hair grow out.Its already so thick..i don't need to add lots of length to it.-_-    Anywho....Thats all... Someone please give me a call later this week..im terribly bored and need interaction with someone other than family..."

"event","I hate living with Christians....>.<  They are so fucking hypocritical and just...annoying...This morning I was helping a bit with making breakfast and my sister started talking to her son about all this shit about suicide and how you automatically go to hell and crap...HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW THAT ??? HAVE YOU EVER COMMITED SUICIDE AND GONE TO HELL ?!! HAVE YOU EVER MET SATAN ???!?!?!.....thats right...i thought so.stupid bitch... she just kept going on and on about how hell is like a never ending Fireplace with permant burning wood. How the fuck do you know that ? Ever been to hell ?Hmm?...why is it when someone takes their own life that people that knew them automatically think 'that poor person,they have to spend eternity in hell,burning like a christmas log..'Have any of you ever known what its like to die ? No because if you died you wouldnt be living on earth to regale the tell..YOU DUMBASSES !!!! Just to let you in on a little secret..THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY A MAN.... and as we all know Men can make up just about anything we want,just go check the fiction section of your local library...Just because the bible says what Jesus did,doesnt make it true ? Were any of you there to witness any of these miracles ? Dont think so !And no one will ever know because if it all were true we would never find out anyways because those people died a LONG ASS TIME AGO !! And dont dare give me any crap about how they've found proof with some cave and crap like that..Dont believe everthing you hear...because most of the time..it isnt true...

"event","Woot ! I had soo much fun at Pipers house yesterday..although she lives out in boonieville..lol When me and ally got there we saw chrissy and i kinda attacked her since we hadn't hung out in forever.^_^ Emily and Heather were already there too and it was all fun babeh..oooh ya..Except for the part when Chrissy accused me of humping/molesting  Fido, Pipers dog.But heres what didnt happen. Piper had gone outside to smoke and Ally,Heather and Emily went with just to talk.Fido kept walking between me and chrissy,wanting to be petted.I noticed that everyone was right outside the window behind chrissy and I started to do these weird ghetto dance moves,making chrissy laugh.But alas no one noticed..Well Ally did once but that was it.Me and chrissy were still laughing when they all came back and they wanted to know what was so funny and Chrissy told them that I had raped the dog. EWWWWWW...Anyways we just kept goofing off,everyone making fun of me for molesting poor Fido.But then we got kinda bored and Ally made Piper drink some nasty crap..like pickle juice and coffe creamer or something...ugh..Then we got out a deck of cards and played bullshit and Egyptian Rapture ( I call it Rat screw though.It was fun,although they made me take of my rings for E.R...something about breaking bones..i dunno (Ruin my fun..heh ) 
 Then we went down to the basment and piper,ally, and pipers cousin Aj..Which i knew i had known her from somewhere before.. all played twister..it was fun when we put them in uncomfortable positions then left them that way for a bit.Then Booby got home ^_^ His hair is longer ! it looks soooo cute now. heh..After we ate and had cake everyone hung out in pipers room,having fun messing with stuff on the internet.Bobby showed us all what i like to call 'the images that will make you go blind'..it was very very very very nasty.Nekkid-ness of which i never hope to see ever again.Then Kat arrived all lateness but we all still had fun. Then me and ally had to leave cuz her mommy arrived at like 9..

But i had fun.... and just to let everyone know  I DID NOT MOLEST FIDO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD !!!!!!"

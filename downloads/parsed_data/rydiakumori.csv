"event","Merry Xmas to you all. I am writing this now because I will not have a chance to do so any time sooner. Due to work. But I like being able to feed my lil Prince.. it makes him happy. Speaking of... 

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rydiakumori/pic/00003ey5"" width=""432"" height=""551"">

yay =D

I dont know if I ever meantioned this but (to those of you who dont know) That is Prince's show name (or in human terms, ""Real name"") Prince is just his barn name (again, human terms it means nick name)

I think I'll put down his Info... I am board and have nothing else to do... hehe

Name: Nobella Prize ""Prince""
     Sire: Fair American
        Dam: No Bella
Height: 16.2 HH (Hands High... a hand is about four inches. Do the math.) 
Weight: about 1,100 lbs. He is still alittle skinny. But he looks good! 
Date Foaled (birthday): May 4th 1995
Color: He is a chestnut/sorrel. He is the color of bronze... the color of the sun at sunset... he is REALLY shiney. 
Markings: Only the one on his head. Thats a half of a star. 
Tattoo: On the inside of his lip. 
Background info: Nobella Prize started his life out as a race horse. He raced 71 times during his 7 year career, although he only won about 9 times. (But won almost $80,000 by the time he was eight years old, which is better then most) By the time he was retired, he was adopted  before by people who really didnt have time for him due to their other 3 horses who were younger... (which is how he lost all his weight--- they didnt feed him!) Adopted by me when he was 9, almost 10, he now lives at RoseTown stables with his buddy Diamond the Palomino. (Thus the old title ""Bronze to Gold""-- its going to be the name of my stables when I get one) His Favorite treats are Peppermints (send all unwanted Candy canes!) and carrots... but has been known to eat Dohnuts, Cheeze-its, Granolia bars, and Moutain dew.He is currently 11 years old.

Btw-- Diamond is Keith's horse. Palomino is the color of a blonde--or, gold,--- horse. 

I really need to get new pics up of him. Both of them. lol."

"event","Its been a while... Only because my computer is more prone to crashing on a daily basis then ever before... actually, before it got updated, it never crashed at all... Now, somedays the blue screen of death is all I see of it. 

So, My birthday came and went without much... well, of anything. I did go see Flicka the day before with Amber and Keith, but that was about it. My brother came to see me the weekend after... only determined to attempt to get me drunk. Didnt happen. He only succeeded in intoxicating himself. Other than that, he was only there to see my sister's play this year... She was in Alice in Wonderland. She was the mouse.

What is sad though, is this thanksgiving turned out to be one of the best ever... simply because we didnt go to some old people's house (My grandmother's when I lived in NH, and it always has been Norm's Parents house here) and be forced to watch some cruddy football game all day. Instead we did nothing, and ate turkey. Pretty uneventfull. 

Proabably the only eventfull thing that has happened to me so far is almost being crushed by a 1500 pound retard. Of the equine species, of course... Because her fat ass busted down a gate, as she was too stupid to stop. 
And, who is stupid/brave enough to stand in the way of this hooved form of rampageing insainity?? One guess :-) I couldnt just let her run into the road, and alas, she couldnt quite get her footing as she rounded that corner and almost fell right on top of me. Ah, happy days.
I wasnt scared though... but I am afraid to say that my dog has more loyalty then brains. I'm the only one that this little dog likes, you see, and he wont leave my side... Not even for a giant doggy squisher (At least, to him it is) He didnt get hurt though. 

I WOULD have had help while all this chaos was going around (another horse had thrown his rider due to the other one) but my fellow co-worker was sitting inside eating doughnuts... even though she had arrived 2 hours late that day... makeing all of us wait that day, so she could be there at the meeting we were suppose to have at 10:30 that morning, but didnt have untill 12:00 
Needless to say that Saturday was a very long day. 

Speaking of rageing stupidity, I saw someone get what was comeing to them the other day... I dont feel bad for them at all. They were riding their horse without a helmet, and nearly got their head cracked open like an egg. The horse didnt even do anything wrong, it was completly rider. Actually, and not very many people know this, %99.9 of ALL falls are the riders fault :-) It doesnt matter weather the horse spooks, bolts, shys, ect ect... it happened because you didnt have controll. You are the leader here, not the horse. (after all, you are human... and that <i>does<i> mean you are automaticly smarter, and wiser then ""Gods creatures"" correct? *sicker*) 
But anyway, the horse mearly slipped, the rider came off balance and wham! head met stone.  Serves them right for being cocky. All it takes is one little something to go wrong (girth breaks... stirrup leathers... bridle...even your saddle tree is not indestuctable...) and off you go! 
Personally, I wear a helmet because I want to cauntious when my horse finds himself scared and riderless, and be able to catch him before he hurdles himself into traffic. But, alas, this person was proabably only thinking of herself and how she hated helmet hair, and never gave a second thought to the horse... Not many people do these days. Its sad.

Any way... enough about horses... but I have little time left before the blue screen of death surely, eats me. 
I got all of the Sailor Moon Movies off of ebay, last week for under $10. I'm happy about that.

Oh yes... I play Gaia as well, my username being RydiaKumori... but it doesnt like any of the email addresses I have given them, and thus, I have never gotten my account fully activated. It never botherd me because I never really needed it to do any of the things I needed. but I do plan on sending a email to Gaia staff or whatnot in the hopes of getting that problem solved.... as soon as I have time...."

"event","So, I ended up going to the mall yesterday... It was the first place I had been too besides Keith's, here (home) and, of course the barn in MONTHS. I was so excited, I even got done early at work to go... but it was kind of a let down. I just felt like I didnt belong there anymore...

I mean, I walked into HotTopic... and nothing interested me. Of course, I still loved being in the book store (Boarders) but they didnt have any Unicorn Chronicals books. I really need to stop letting people borrow things, I never get them back... especially books, which is why I need to buy the UC books again. They had Phantom, but not in paper back... hasnt come out yet. Sadness. 

The only thing at the mall, besides the books, was this little side shop, set up in the food court on tables... Selling things made by Native Americans. Selling T-shirts, hand made sweaters, Pan flutes, recorders, and other insturaments. And CDs! yay... one of them was set up with a mic, playing a Pan Flute. It was so pretty. So, me, my mom, and my little sister bought a pan flute, a recorder, and a CD. 

HotTopic kind of made me depressed though, I guess I'm just not a mall rat anymore. Which leaves me with very little left to do, but then again I hardly ever have time to do much of anything anyway. So it doesnt matter, I suppose.

Keith is snoring on the floor, asleep because he was out all night with some Co-workers/friends.. being their designated driver so they could drink as much as they want. I get very lonely here without him..."

He is okay though, just alittle swelling. Hopefully nothing more then a bruise. He wasnt lame when I left, so thats good... I'll check him again in the morning before work. I probably wont ride him for the next few days though, just to be sure. I'd rather just look at him then for me to ruin him anyway. He is more important then that.

I gave you shit because of all the shit you put every one through. Because of you, Kim will never trust me again, because I always had your back saying ""Yes, she is reliable"" ""Yes, Kim, she will show up"" ""maybe she had a good reason why she for got to do..."" the MILLION STUPID THINGS YOU TRIED TO PULL. 

I remember once, you called off sick... and then the next day you were at my house, and were all like ""I saw my ex yesterday and blah blah blah"" what the hell were you doing out of your house if you were ""sick?"" 

And the time you ""Broke your arm"". BS. Hairline fracture my ass. YOU NEVER ONCE HAD PROOF THAT IT HAD HAPPENED. In the REAL WORLD you need XRAYS to PROVE that its even completly broken!! The only time it isnt nessacary is when its so obvious, that your arm is crooked, or BONE IS JUTTING OUT OF YOUR FLESH. 
And I KNOW for a FACT that you asked if RoseTown would pay for part of the cost for xrays. DUH!! Its called a RELEASE form, the dont have to pay you shit!! Its also OHIO LAW. 

Oh, btw... when we were talking about RoseTown selling Cocoa, you asked me ""Why are they trying to sell cocoa for bucking off brittany and not sell silver?"" 
Here is your answer, and I was trying to be nice to you by not saying it but oh well now: Good riders can ride Silver. Nuff said. Not saying your a bad rider... I am only speaking truth here, not trying to be mean... but You weren't ready for her yet. I didnt just approved how you thought just because you cant ride her, she should be sold to who knows where and RTS Shouldnt have her. Sounds like someones ego got hurt to me. 

You always told Kim how you wanted more hours, you need more money, yata yata yata... so she gave wendy all the easy days and gave you less night turnouts, so you could make more money... and what did you do? You complained about it. You wanted the money but you never wanted to WORK for it. You never proved to Kim that you were capable or reliable enough to prove it. 

You only worked 3 god damn days a week. THREE!!!  And most of the time you couldnt even SHOW UP!!! You were always telling me how tired you were, how you didnt want to do your stalls.

I tried to stick up for you, I really did... but after a while, it got too hard. I got you that job, and you didnt even have the decentcy to do the grown up thing and tell someone you were quitting. Instead you put everyone into a tough situation and had to do your work for you. 

Well, I feel sorry for you now.... because if you indeed do have a job, I am damn sure they wont put up will all the call offs, showing up late, and I would be surprised if someone will give you a ride to work like me and Kim sometimes did when Tom proved to be unreliable. Thats how things work in the real world.

"event","Hello! Yes, I know it has been a while... but oh well, life goes on. Alot has happened since my last real post, so, I'll try to type as much of it as possible... 

Anyway, Back in december, I lost my job... lol, I hated that job anyway. It sucked. People complain too much, especially to those they really shouldnt be complaining to. I can understand if they complain in their own homes... but to talk someones ear off who really couldnt give a shit either way? phht. assholes...

Then, in january... my heart found a piece again, as a fell in love with someone named Nobella Prize. A 10 year old, sixteen hands high, chestnut, ex-race horse gelding. I bought him the day I met him, for only $700.00 and nicknamed him Prince, for he is indeed the prince of my heart. He is underweight, but too damn smart for his own good. But I love him ^_^ I will have pictures up soon.

In febuary, came Keith... yes, my first boyfriend. Actually, a boyfriend 3 times over, for that is how many times I have gone out him. He's a sweetheart, and things with him have settled in nicely. I'm glad he is here now, with me.

Since Keith has moved in, my brother shaun has visited twice, once because he was down in florida, and while he was taking planes, he figured he might as well stop in here too. The second time, was just last month, to see wissit in the school play ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" She was a dancer, and lol, I still cant get the silly songs out of my head. As with Shaun and Andrea, my ex-best friend... all I did was ask her not to mess around with my brother... no matter if he started it first, because she is already with someone else. She told me she wouldnt... I had her word, and she broke it. Thus, the reason she and I are no longer speaking. Its not was she did, its the simple fact that she can't keep her word to me. 

Oh, and Chad? He is what I would concider my best friend... Im happy he got a girlfriend. Now, we can all be happy ^_^ 

so, that is basicly it... but soon, I will have pictures up of Prince, and Marcus (my dog. Black and white Papillon... too cute) but ah, first I must get the pictures developed... But untill then, I shall sit here on my ass and wait for Keith to get home from work... bah. Must finish this up, as the dogs are barking... must find out why... I will post again, eventually... never anything to really talk about... lol. See ya!"

"event","Not that anyone cares, though. I'm not even sure if anyone even still reads this thing. Oh well. I guess nothing really important ever goes on in my life... well ,not important enough to write about. Mainly, I just go to work. Yup, thats all I do... Eat, sleep, Go to work. Dont even go to school or anything. If I did, where to... or the better question is, What for? I have no Idea what I want to do with my life. I dont write anymore and I certanly dont draw anymore at all. Just work... In case any of you do read this and wonder, I work at a gas station. A BP to be more spacific. No, I dont want you talking to me just to whine and complain about Gas prices. I'm only going to say this once... THATS NOT MY PROBLEM, NOR IS IT MY FAULT. We, nor any gas stations, do not control gas prices. Its where it comes from that makes the decision. You know what that means? Gas stations, in fact, do not make a single penny from their Gas! It pays for itself. So, I dont want to hear it... 
Yes, that kind of stuff does piss me off. 

So, you may be thinking that my life is just headed off, with no direction... that isnt entirely true. I actually am persuing a dream... Perhaps the oldist dream I have. Whats that you might say? Owning my own horse. One that I can manage myself and just be MINE. No one else's. That means it cant ever be taken away. This dream is the most batterd and bruised of them all, as it has been close to being shatterd. Matter of fact, it always comes right within my reach before being snatched away before I could get a grip. Not this time. I'm saving my money (Currently have 1300 saved! yay!) and it is going to happen. I swear, all the customer complaints are soo going to be worth it if I can make this work... Oh yes >) 

Ok...Guys. Not all of them suck, but most do. I no longer have pillow. Well, he was never my boyfirend to begin with, but much more important. At first, I lost his interest to another but for some reason (I dont know, but what ever it is, it has to be crazy) last month, I got him back, only to lose him again. Not to another this time... but a different way. I have been sworn to silence, and I will keep it. My heart is broken, but I will live. I'll just keep telling myself that its just another guy... 

I might talk more about pillow later... Might make a interesting post. I have memories that must be kept... 

Well, as for other guys... I still have that ""Fan club"" of people who want to go out with me. Theres the usual online category, but, ever since I moved to ohio, I have had a Local one as well (wtf is up with that? Most likely too much smoke in the air or something) Those on that list include: 
   Chad- May be my #1 stalker. He's a really nice guy, and such a sweetheart (Not bad looking either) He's probably the type of Guy I SHOULD fall for....yet, for some reason, I have not. I dont know what it is, but I guess there is something missing. I dunno, I've always been crazy. Although, I just can't make my heart feel something it won't.
   Shoey- Eh, well ,I guess Chad has som competition when it comes to being the number one stalker. This guy is getting to be alittle creepy. I've only known him for about 2 or 3 weeks, and already he wants to spend ever second he can with me. He hates the fact that I wont go out with him, and that I dont do the whole 'bf/gf' thing anymore at all. Mainly because of pillow, but when I think about it, I really dont need it. Once I get my horse...what would I need a guy for? I'd be happy then. Anyway, back to Shoey, he wants me to go out with him, yet thurday night he has a 'fling' with a girl he met at a Club. LOL Good for him. But what really pissed me off about him is, I actually opened up to him, and told him what was going on with pillow (not into any details, but just basicly that I'm going to lose him as a pillow) and what does he do? He asks me out! That was the last thing I wanted to hear...  A few things he must learn though: I dont like being rushed, I hate being lied to, Dont ever call me perfect... and I don't Dance! 
   Then, we come to two guys, I will group together... Thats Nate and Josh. This can all be explained very easily: Ex boyfriends, hardly ever talk to me. Not a chance

Well, That would be it... only there is Kaze and Keith. Yes, I still talk to both guys. Kaze is going to come see me in April, and Keith may be coming... to live with me. lol Go figure, eh? No clue what his intensions are, but I could use the company, so I dont mind at all. 

neh, I suppose I have ranted enough... you may not have seen the last of me yet, though, cause I just might be back when I get off of work tomorrow... or rather, today (sunday) I work 2 till 10 PM. 

If not, G'night all, and I wish you all a very, mery Xmas."

"event","Okay, I have searched the net high and low, looking for the lyrics to the ending theme to The Dog Of Flanders anime and I have found nothing, which sucks. So... I wrote them down myself. If anyone has a problem with them, they can correct me ... or do it themselves.  Oh yeah and **= indicates that I have no Idea what that line really says, so I'm guessing. well, here goes...

""When I cry (I call out your name)"" Sung by Dianne Reeves.

I'm awakened without reason
it's that restless kind of season
I hear the thunder, I hear the raindrops
then I see rainbows, a rainbow of you 
I can remember, just like that summer
the summer when I found a friend in you 

When I cry, I call out your name
I can recall all of our childhood
Like a dream that will never die, love
I've taken my sorrow, and you bring me to the light
When I cry, I call out your name
Just touch me with heaven, at my doorstep 
to remind me that I won't be alone
Forever is kinder if its you who will remind me
That our love, no it will not die 
Show your face to me my love
you are this darkness, let me know you're home

You're my prayer when its night time
you give strength to my life line
are you an angel, with all of your wonders? 
**a star that is shining** within the sky? 
Can you still see me, becoming a woman?
Can you believe its been such a long time?

when I cry, I call out your name
the echoes of strangers sound familiar
as if it were you I keep hearing
I don't want to follow, if its here I belong 
but its true, that I miss your smile
I'll carry your memory throughout my lifetime
though the winters and through the summertime
I wipe away tear drops, cause I'm stronger then I know
when I cry, no, it wont be the same

The laughter of friends, my palm in your hand
this what life seems to be telling me, I need to see

When I cry, I can be set free
like journeys of rivers to the ocean
its like were together for always 
there is no denying, 
I found courage in knowing your love
And I see, you will always be
the sweetest love I have known.

The sweetest friendship
You've made me strong."

"event","Snow can wait
I forgot my mittens
Wipe my nose
Get my new boots on
I get a little warm in my heart
When I think of winter
I put my hand in my father's glove
I run off
Where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown
I hear a voice
""Your must learn to stand up for yourself
Cause I can't always be around""
He says
When you gonna make up your mind
When you gonna love you as much as I do
When you gonna make up your mind
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change my dear

Boys get discovered as winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun
Years go by and I'm here still waiting Withering where some snowman was
Mirror mirror where's the crystal palace
But I only can see the myself
Skating around the truth who I am
But I know dad the ice is getting thin

When you gonna make up your mind
When you gonna love you as much as I do
When you gonna make up your mind
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change my dear

Hair is grey
And the fires are burning
So many dreams 
On the shelf
You say I wanted you to be proud of me
I always wanted that myself

He says
When you gonna make up your mind
When you gonna love you as much as I do
When you gonna make up your mind
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses have gone ahead
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change
My dear"

~~~
Don't know what to say, I've lost my head
So I'll just write you a cruddy poem instead
You're always here for me
I don't know, but I can see
the look in your eyes
there's so many secrets, but you never tell me any lies.
And I wonder, just why you keep coming around for?
maybe, perhaps, for something more? 
But I know your answer to that is true. 
You don't know how much you've seen me through
I can't thank you enough, and never will
because time keeps going, it never stands still
and with it comes more pain
nothing ever stays the same
so I know I'll be needing you again.
But I'll be okay, 
Its just that, what im really trying to say
If I've learned anything, its not really what you say, its what you do
so despite everything, I just want to be there for you. 

~~~~~

I grow more sappy by the minute."

Almost acoustic christmas was AMAZING! me and rosie (who came back from england a few days ago) went to the gig. and it was truly amazing. all the bands rocked so much. Heres the results:

1. Greenday 
2. Sum 41
3. My Chemical Romance
4. Social D
5. Velvet revolver

  The other bands wernt as rockin as those. That was the top 5. So when the gig started the first band on was my chemical romance. They rocked so much. A great looking band that can actually play really well while rockin out. Then the used came on. they wernt as good as i was hoping. Then chevelle came on. i dont think n e one liked them. it was jst kinda boring. but they did their thing and thats cool. it wasnt me or rosies cup of tea. Then good charlotte were next. It was not so good. They looked really pissed off and not happy to be there. n e ways! moving on!!!!!!! so then papa roach came on. They were actually pretty good. The frontman was really good. pretty intence. he got pissed of at rosie and gave her a face cus rosie was like, whats the big deal? to his face. it was funny. n e ways! moving on! then the best band came on ... Sum 41! they were so fucking good! it was the best time iv ever seen them so far. deryck did an elvis impression and came out in a fat suite and sum aviators then died on the toilet. haha. it was funny. Me and sum guys started the fist pit of the night. it was so fun. twas good. i was rocking out the whole time. good job sum 41, u pulled it off again! so ye. me and rosie were with this girl and her dad alot till incubus came on. the dad was so funny. it was like a big biker dude who was totaly drunk. he was chill. he was in the pit with me too. very cool dude. n e ways! me and rosie left wen ncubus came on and got sum cheros. then velvet revolver came on and they did a great show. that is one great frontman. seriously. and iv now seen slash play live! cool huh? ha ye. i thought so. So then then ultimate band of the night came on........ GREENDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The whole venue went crazy! They loved them. they pkayed the whole american idiot album then longview. What a great band. Theyr jst speacial u know. They know how to do it. theres few things that ever one loves. and ice cream is one of them. jk. Greenday are def one of those bands that everyone can say they love in some way or another. during a song billy stopped playing and told the security to fuck off basically. He says "" hey hey, wat r u doing? Theses kids are jst having a good time!"" and then they all left! i was so happy! i was waiting for sum band to say that all night. im glad it was billy who said it tho. that was so cool. rock on greenday!

Oh well. She was speacial tho cus i had wanted to go out with her for well over a year now. kinda funny. well not really. its sad. but what can u do? cant win em all. thats life. i totaly acceplt that now. im not gonna go looking for a new gf right now. its a nice feeling to have one, i love it. its a real feeling of companionship and love. but i dont want one right now. the last 2 girls iv had relationships with, ended like this. im a loyal guy too, id never cheat on my gf now. its wrong. i wouldnt like them doing it to me so i dont to it to them. so there. iv jst been taling to my friend jasmin, also shes one of ali's best friends (ali was my gf). and i feel like i got alot off my chest. shes really cool. i like her alot. shes gonna be my new gf advisor. her being a girl, its pretty perfect really! alright. well i still have to talk to ali about all this and why she did it n all. well actually i already know. she liked the other guy better than me. she woulnd even ever kiss me so it kinda makes alot of sense. we went out for almost 2 months and not one single kiss. lame huh? thats what i thought.

Get this. on like tuesday november 23rd Tim Armstrong fucking took me to a Greenday gig in longbeach! Me and the band were at an audition for sum TV thing where we had to rock out with air guitars. There, i got a call on my cell phone from Tim saying ""Hey man, its tiiiiim, from ranciiiiiddddd. Where going to the greenday show together right man?"" to which i replied ""Yes."" A few mins later he called back after the audition and was like ""Hey man, its tiiiiiim, from ranciiiiddddd. Benji is gonna be driving us to the show man. Its gonna be cool , we can kick it and hang out, its gonna be cool homie. Just be at my house by 6pm and dont be to late."" So off we went to find Tim armstrongs address! I got the street name wrong, so we called epitaph and got the address. very cool. very hip. very chill. it was happenin'. So we left the audition and dad drove me and jack to tims house where we then waited for a ""benji"" to arrive. Little did i know that when the car pulled up it was in fact benji madden from the infamouse good charlotte. quite exciting. Im not a fan but he was really chill. one of the nicest guys in showbiz. He brought some friend with him too, he was cool, played in a band called promdate in canada. So jack n dad leave and me, tim, benji and friend set off to the best show of my life so far. on the way we talked about music. and we listened to our bands demo CD! i put on sum new songs for tim to hear but then he told me he's heard these live like 4 times. We went into starbucks for a mintue to pick up some coffe for tim and Benji started whistling Forgive and Forget the past (One of our songs on the new demo) and i thought that was really cool cus it was like, wow its catchy. goodtimes. We then went to McDonalds to get sum food. So of course benji got reconized by like 5 people in McDonalds by the cooks and the manager. It was autograph time. Tim films everything, he's into documenting good times n such. Its a good idea. So we set off to the show and when we go there we were at the side of the stage watching the last half huor of new found glory. They did a really good show. Some kid slapped the lead guitarist on the face so they stopped the show and tried to get the kid kicked out of the venue. Didnt work, so the guitarist jst kicked his head a few times. so he cried. So after the show NFG were pissed off at the kid but they cant let one loser ruin the rest of the show u know wat i mean. There was alot of people there to see them rock. Ok, moving on!!!!! After the show Tim had given me his camera to take care of during the show to take sum pics for him. So i went to the side of the stage to take a pic and stryker from KROQ comes walking off the stage cus he jst introduced greenday. He reconized me and was like "" Hey Orange!"" and i was like ""cool..."" I asked him for tix to almost acoustic xmas for night 1 for mike but he couldnt get me n e, its totaly sold out. But i did manage to get two tix for me and my sister for night 2! $600 each! its worth it tho! Brilliant bands are playing. its gonna be the best. Ok, so moving on!!!!! I got kicked out! Of the back stage that is. i didnt have an all access pass so they gave me the boot. GIVE EM THE BOOT 4 IN STORES NOW! FEATURING NO REST FOR THE WEEKEND BY ORANGE!!!!!! Anyways, i was so pissed. I was in the pit with Tim armstrongs camera. I tried to talk my way back stage but it didnt work. Aparently there was nothing they could do. Even tho I had a VIP pass.... I was like forget this, Im having a good time. So i had to put tims camara in my pocket and jst hope it wouldnt break. It didnt by the way. So after an hour and a half in the pit rockin to some of the best punk rock songs ever written i was ready to get back to Tim. So i went to where they kicked me out and theres the guy from that band promdate. He was like ""Dude u gotta walk around the stadium to the bus's and meet us there."" So i was like ""No prob"". So i walked round to the bus's after looking for zak for a few mins cus he was there too in the pit but we didnt find eachother. I walked to the back stage and was like, ""You have to let me in, i have asthma and diabetis and Tim has my stuff."" So they were about to let me in wen i heard Tim calling my name from behind in the car. I ran to tim and jumped in the car. I was like so thankfull to all of them for taking me to the show. we all had like a big heart to heart kinda thing about how amazing the night was. Tim is so awsome, hes the best. Such a good guy. like everthing he does is true and theres no other motive apart from the fact that he really likes you and hes a great person in general. On the way back we talked about cars and satalite navigation systems. So in the end it all added to be the best night of my life so far. Being driven aroud by benji madden, invited to a greenday concert by the king of punk rock tim armstrong and seeing the BEST LIVE BAND EVER!!!!! Greenday! It all was so perfect and amazing. Thank you so much Tim! You fucking rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

its cool, visiting my old (rosies current) school here in Battle. get this right, the first night we were here, me, molly, rosie and mum were walking to this italian resturant that sells pasta... make sense? any ways. these girls started shouting at us and one of them said ""thats the one that was checking me out the other day"" its funny cus i had been in england about 4 hours. what a douche, what a maroon! then they threw stones at us to which rosie replied to them ""piss off."" turns out its all because rosie and molly go to battle abbey and i was wearing mollys blazer so they thought i went to battle abbey too.... mums coat acted as a protective furry sheild againts the stones. after we escaped the 3 bitches, we sat down in the resturant and they walked by the window give me the british middle finger (the ""V"") to which i replied ""YOU FUCKING CUNTS!"" and i chased them down the street with my knife from the resturant. im so punk rock at times. its comes so naturaly to me u know. well that was a story to tell no wasnt it. peace."

In all honesty, I switched over to World of Warcraft. When I got my laptop a week ago, I found myself starting at the FFXI box and thinking ""Well... I did want to kill Yagudo again...""

And thus, I installed FFXI back onto my laptop. Chakotay, on the other hand, had never stopped playing FFXI. He'd actually gotten Tyne to level 36 Thief, got her Utsusemi, and somehow had some level 75 ninja armor <i>donated</i> to her. I was rather stunned.

So, I've taken up the reigns of my old characters, and will be playing again. Of course, I have to get those new jobs from Treasure of Aht Urhgan, of course.

Well... if I don't spend all my time as Kommissa or Ankinten!"

How long has it been? Ages. Ages and ages and ages.

Well, here's an overview of life in the past few months...

Level 34... and I know that I could have long since gotten to a higher level but no one wants a THF/NIN. Yes, you read right. I was using Ninja as my subjob-- I got to level 19, and I did <i>not</i> have Utsusemi. I was a gimp ninja. Well, I played ninja as the sub from level thirty to level thirty-four, which actually took about three months. Not a whole lot of fun that. 

Tired of not leveling, I went around and got as many advanced jobs as I could. All I'm missing now is Paladin and Summoner-- and Paladin is half done, while Summoner is seven eighths completed. 

I spent a lot of time farming bat wings in order to get the gil needed to buy my Noct Armor. Blessed Altana I love that armor... which brings me to my new job.

Yes, you read right. New job-- not just ""new subjob"" but new <i>job</i>. I've given up on THF ((for the time being, at least)) and have taken up being a RNG. Ranger is the coolest thing ever. I'm a damage dealer!

Just today I reached level twenty-three-- and twenty-two and twenty-one. Yup. Three levels in one day. And it's not even low-levels! I feel so proud of myself... although, this is actually a bit of a trend. I got eighteen, nineteen and twenty in the same day. And before that, I got fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen. Wonderful! 

I hope things continue on like this. I'm having fun again.

So I've been hacking things to bits as a Warrior. That's fun-- and I'm leveling so much faster than white mage or theif, but that's probably because warrior has more strength, and I've got theif subbed, so yay ^_^

No one wants to join my RP linkshell, so I'm just going to switch it one for Star Wars fans. Yay Star Wars!

Sometime around midnight, Fennar offered to take me hunting for the Magicked Skull, which is all I needed ((Aside from the level)) to do the Selbina subjob quest. Why couldn't they just let me have subjob ability? I'm a Selbina native! /sulk

So, anyways, I spent a couple hours sitting at the mouth of the Gusgen Mines as Fennar killed thing in search of the skull. I fell asleep a few times, then was joined by Raizin for a while. We didn't talk, but it was nice to have company. Oh! And Topdog offered to help me, but I informed him that an LS-friend was already helping me. Topdog was nice.

So, after getting the skull, I planned on running back to San D'oria to tuck it away with the rest of my belongings, but then got the genius idea that I needed to get to level 18. I didn't, but I wanted to...

Anyways, I put my flag up, and put into my comment that I was trying to reach level 18, and I was 2200 off of 17. I also mentioned that I didn't speak japanese-- but it wasn't until I put in ""Japanese / English Party Ok"" that I got any invites. It was pretty fun, although I missed the first time we tried to pull off a skillchain. Oops...

I'm just over half-way to level 17 now, for which I thank Ophen, and Green and the rest of the party. It was a lot of fun. Maybe I'll party with those who speak japanese more. Just because I can't understand the language doesn't mean it's not fun!

Now, hopefully I'll reach level 18 by Monday. It's a long shot, given the hours I'm keeping right now, but I can hope, yes?

"event","Well, it's been a week since I last posted-- but I have good reason for it!

I went to go visit my grandparents in Mhaura. See, while mom and me are from Selbina, dad was originally from Mhaura-- mom made him move to Selbina just before they got married because she got tired of a long distance relationship /em sweatdrop

So, I went to visit my grandparents, for the first time by myself. I was, to be honest, very scared of what might happen. Thankfully, I got there without harm, and the most exciting thing to happen was a Sea Monk. I stayed well out of the way of that one! My poor little level fifteen butt wouldn't have been able to handle it.

So I went and stayed with my grandparents for a few days, and then got back on the boat to Selbina. Unfortunately, this time pirates boarded us. I went right down into the hold and hid the moment I saw the pirate ship coming up to us! It was terrifying down there, listening to the sounds of battle above, and knowing that if I went up, I'd die. Again. Sometimes, being essentially Immortal sucks; because you remember every time you've died. /sigh

Well, I got back into Selbina and made a silly little comment to the guys in my LS about wanting to dance a jig. Then I went and reset my homepoint in Selbina, and headed out into the Dunes with my flag held high. I managed to get through the Dunes without aggroing anything, and did some damage to Rock Eaters and Grass Fungars in La Theine. A comment from Ghelf had me head back out into the Dunes to try and find him ((after healing of course, that ""decent challenge"" Fungar nearly killed me)), but I never did. Oh well, I can get my skull later.

So I headed back to Selbina, although I'm not quite sure why I did, and hung around there talking with the people I'd grown up with for awhile. Then it was back out into the Dunes, where I accidentally attacked a Damselfly while I was trying to /check it. Oops... I ended up zoning back to Selbina-- and just as I enter the town, I get a /invite! 

So happy that I'd been invited to party after so long soloing and not getting very far, I just accepted without asking any questions.

I'm happy to say they were a great party! I leveled up! So did Cairo-- and Cairo went up <i>three</i> levels. It was really cool. We all decided that we want to party together some time, despite our leader's accidental causing of over half our party's deaths-- what he thought was a zone wasn't, and we got cornered by a Bogy. Him and me, we got out but the others... they weren't so lucky. We zoned to Selbina and waited there until morning. My father came by to glare at everyone and take me aside to ask me to drop the party. I told him I was having fun and gave him the best puppy dog eyes I ever had. Success! He let me go out again!

So when we finally parted ways, I put our leader on my friendslist, and decided that the next time he's on I'll do a search for the others. It was fun!

"event","Well, it's been awhile... Let me explain to you the hecticness of this past week, and maybe you'll understand.

A few of the guys in my linkshell offered to help me and two others get the items needed for our subjobs quests-- and no, I haven't reached level 16 yet, let alone level 18-- so we went into the Valkurm Dunes and di some hunting. Everything was going well-- we had our aprons and our worms, and all we needed were the skulls. So Eleric, he was our party leader, decided to take us out to the Gusgen Mines to hunt for Ghouls in order to get the skull. 

Unfotunately for me, I got lost in Konschtat, and then the party disbanded... and well, I was terrified of going back to San D'oria by myself. Yes, I know that I come from Selbina, and that I had to trek to San D'oira before-- but I was with a whole band of people then, not running solo. I'm so far from ready to take on Valkurm solo, that it's not funny.

So I inched my way through Konschtat, and back through Valkurm-- and I got aggroed, which sent me back to my home point at the fort in Valkurm. Oh how I wished I'd left my home point in Ronafaure! 

Still, I managed to get back to La Theine by trailing along behind some higher levels, and started the long trek back to Ronafaure and San D'oira. Of course, me being me, I had to decide that I was going to go to Davoi and finish the mission I had. Once again, I don't lost. /sticks her tongue out

Somehow I managed to get to Battallia Downs, and I freaked out a few times. Camped right on the edge of the zone for a couple days before working up the courage to make my third run through Jugner Forest. I got back to La Theine with little problem, then headed towards San D'oria. Eventually I got back-- just in time to save my plants from a horrid death! The poor things...

Well, after a day of rest in my moghouse, I started out again, this time pretty sure that I wouldn't get lost in the Forest, and that I <i>was</i> going to get to Davoi. Didn't happen-- I got invited to a party, and the four of us headed for the Ghelsba Outpost to beat up Orcs. But our leader ((Nahh)) got upset and disbanded us because we didn't have a whm-- after almost an hour of partying together /sigh

So finally I headed out for Davoi. This time, I got there, but it was a close call, given how much I panicked whenever I saw an Orc so much more powerful than I was. I got in, I talked to the guard, I ran forwards and looked into the camp... said ""screw it, I didn't come here to die"", and turned around. Made a run all the way back to San D'oria. 

I can only hope I won't have to deal with my father again, come morning.

Well, I ran into Ghelf last night, and he was nice enough to follow me around and hit me up with cures while I was trying to level up. I got within 800 exp of leveling up before I had make a run back to San D'oria. When I got there, I used my hard earned ((read: stolen from orcs and gobs)) gil to buy myself some new armor, that covered me up better-- at Daddy's insistance.

Yes, Daddy was there again. You would think that he'd you know, have customers back home, but nope. He's in San D'oria, trying to drag me home again. /sigh

You know what I used for an excuse this time? That I had a whole bunch of plants in my moghouse that I couldn't just let <i>die</i>, and that I was using them to grow crystals for blacksmithing. Daddy just gave me this look that said all I needed to know-- ""Stop taking the easy way out! Be a proper blacksmith!""

But I don't <i>want</i> to be a blacksmith, and no matter how many times I tell him that, he just won't listen!

Not much else to report, though. Didn't do anything all that exciting. Hopefully, tonight I'll change that-- and hopefully I'll hit level 15 today, but that's doubtful. I should hit it by tommorrow, though, if I keep doing things the way I am.

Although, I never did get to party with any of them-- two invited me while I was at the Ronafaure/La Theine crossing, and it took me too long to get to the Valkurm Dunes, and they'd already formed parties. The third I had to turn down, since I was headed back to San D'oria to meet up with Daddy-- I... er... didn't... exactly... <i>get</i> back to San D'oria today. Oopsey.

I did get to meet with the Defiance Linkshell leader in person, though. It was nice to meet Sordivar; I've talked to him many times, but speaking to him face-to-face was pretty cool. Bladerunner ((who I've seen around several times, but haven't spoken too)) ran up and talked to us-- well, to Sord-- then ran off again. Sord wished me luck in hunting in La Theine. O'course, I can only hunt the Hares and Rock Eaters, with the ocassional Orc or Akbaba thrown in for variety.

You have no idea how happy I was to be back in La Theine when I bolted out of Jugner, an Orc on my ass. Zoning is good.

I made it almost all the way across the plateau without having to heal-- well, technically I didn't heal myself. An Orc aggro'd and I had to take it on, with only half my hp-- and this nice WHM started casting cure II on me. So, I'd like to thank Mayple, yet again /grin

Daddy was in San D'oria again today. I have to wonder how he gets there so quickly, and doesn't get hurt at all-- it's gotta be some sort of magic. Chocobos don't like Daddy-- they tend to bite him he he gets anywhere near them. I put a lot of my old armor up for sale, and that made him happy enough to go back to his shop and not bother me about coming home and doing what I was raised to do.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, no, Daddy did not like my new outfit. He made me wrap myself in a blanket and walk around like that while he was there ((I, of course, took the blanket off after he left-- it was quite hot and stuffy.))

So, I figure I'll be at level 14 tomorrow. I hope. 

I need to jump up a few levels so that I can go partying and <i>not</i> be around when Daddy comes to San D'oria to collect me.

No that making armor isn't important... it's just... I want to wear the armor I make! I don't want to sell it to the WARs that stop by our village! Why can't Daddy understand that...?

Right now, I'm collecting crystals, to amp up my Rank rating thing. Can't go on the next mission until I finish that. Of course, I'm a gil-hoarder, so I still sell all my fire crystals to make some good gil.

I'll have to see if they're on tommorrow or something. I got over 50% of the exp needed to level up partying with them. It was really cool.

Daddy was in San D'oria when I got back-- I barely managed to convince him to let me get my gil from the Auction House before he was dragging me back to my mog house. See... I... kinda... didn't exactly... <i>tell</i> Daddy that I had decided to come to San D'oria and be an adventurer.

Daddy wants me to be a blacksmith. It's in the family, you know.

I managed to convince him to let me wait out the last of my auctions, and sent him back home with some WARs and a WHM. 

Now I just have to figure out how to stay in San D'oria-- and I don't think continually putting things up for Auction is really going to help. Daddy gets mad easily.

"event","ive come to the conclusion that most of the reason why i did what i did was becuz i kinda figured 3 years ago that i would have been dead by now . i definatly didn't expect to see my sixteenth birthday for one reason or another . i feel lik my whole life is soo great but im just soo unhappy . i have soo many great friends and i love them all soo much its just why do i still not see the getting better part of it . everyday i have to deal wit the affects of everything i did and that happened and sometimes i cant deal with it . i run away to other peoples houses becuz i hate having to live the reality of it all . sometimes i think i was better off before everything happened but im almost sure i definatly would have only lasted 6 months tops without either being arrested or six feet under .i know its a terrible way to think but im just in a really bad depressive mood .  sometimes i wish that i had alot to do with it and went away for a long time cuz maybe i would have learned something i think i still learned something actually alot of things but theres a part of me that will NEVER be the same .

at this point in time i dont find myself ever good enough for a guy i feel lik im such a dirtbag or something . i guess when your told wut a fuck up and how trashy you are several times u just start to believe it . i cant really do anything about it . couciling was suppose to help but i feel lik my only way out is leaving the whole situation getting out of my house but how am i really suppose to do that without ending up fucking my life up even werse . i guess i cant but i dont understand if im so great to talk to and so outgoing and so everything else then why aren't we together or why dont u express how u feel becuz it just definatly duznt make sense to me im not even looking for a relationship i just need someone that i know will be there for me and i have friends who are but sometimes i get so un comfortable. i mean im not even very confident anymore its more lik ive just completely lost everything but i guess u have to lose everything before you get it all back . and i guess it just takes time to get it all back but i can't even see when it all is gunna end and life is going to go on . almost everyone treats me diferently now and i hate it im the "" bad influence "" and personally they culd all kiss my ass becuz they obviously dont understand shit than becuz i made alot of bad choices but nothing not to forgive me for . i dont need to be babysat and i dont need someone to tell me wut to do every second of my life i may not be real common sense smart but i can take care of myself i just wish i had my mom who i could actually talk to and not criticize me for everything . my counciler tells me i shouldn't look for someone to praise me but i dont i dont want someone to be lik omg ur soo great everything else i just want someone to be lik hey good job . i dont need to be acknowlaged just appreciated. and  at home i cant say that i am its all just well u didnt do enuf or good enuf nd that just sucks . im really sick of everything now and i just sometimes think i mite have been better off being taken out of my house but i guess only time will tell what will happen to me and know one can give me advice cuz no one knows wut to say but i need it i seriously need someone to think a plan out no matter what and maybe that will work cuz i quit a long time ago . yeah thats it later."

"event","yeah soo i havent writtin in over 2 months .. the beggining of this summer completely kicked ass i was having such a fucking great time .. work at the baseball field was great .. i was hookin up wit cody for awhile .. hes freakin amazing we had our differences tho but were friends . .  me + pun aka christopher mazzarella are amazzzinggg =] i love him to death .. soo that ended and the camp was alrite i cant complain it was money nd i made friends wit dj hes one freakin cooooll asss kidd but we fite likee crazzeee . .  if theres one thing i would like to acknowlage (sp) abt the beginnin of my summer its all the amazing nights at felix park + in foley backyard and everywhere else i wouldnt change all that for the world i made soo many friends nd had such a great time . . it almost seemed lik i lived on a 6 month high which is probably right . but as we all know good times can't last forever but the way mine had to end basically sucked but ill get to that later . . 

aroun july 4 i went to wildwood wit tj's family that was a wholee lot of fun i got really close to tj and now were lik best buds haha nd janice has just been talkin to me and helpin me threw alot of my problems soo i love her to death tj has to be one of the luckiest kids in the world he has the coolest mom ever =] . . after i got back shit kinda started to go down hill my mom found out that i had been doin pot for a long time now . .  nd then a week later she found out that i had been leavin everynite nd comin home at lik 4- 5 am in the mornin soo she basically bugged out and then all this shit went down wit judd and now my life is just a bigg fuckingg mess .. judd's life is werse but mines pretty bad ... i have to go to all this therapy nd shit its pretty fuckin rediculous im hoping that one day they'll just take me out of my house i guess only if im lucky but idk wut to do anymore my family treats me really baddly .. i mean imagine if ur wholee world came crashing down nd u were reduced to doing a whole lot of nothing while going threw withdrawls non stop yeah it fucking sucks u have no clue .. i guess im lucky that the cops didnt put my ass in juvie for all the bad shit i've been doing these past 3 years . .  ive been such a fuck up but im ready to start over . .. ive decided i wanna just be a normal kid not some fucking stoned drunk bitch it was good while it lasted but its time to get my life straightened out . . now that i have some commitment in my life im gunna go with it . . but i've noticed that since all this shit went down a couple uv my friendships have been goin down the shitter and idk if its completely gone or wut anymore . .

my friendship wit foley has definatly changed we cant see eachother alot really soo i rely on the ""blocked phone calls "" and talking online nd the occassional wen no ones home and we run into eachother it sucks i fucking hate not being able to see my best friend hes the greatest nd im happy that after everything were still strong nd holdin on to our friendship . . but everything with sara has basically idk kinda gone to hell .. like i feel lik sometimes i dont even no her anymore and ive just been soo caught up in my shit that i havent had alot of time for him . . i think its been lik 3 weeks since we've actually hung out but theres not to much i can do i feel lik sometimes im the only one whose tryin to keep our friendship i love her to death and i wouldnt want to live wit out her . . i just need her to tell me wuts going on in her life cuz ive never seen her soo down in the dumps =/ . .  nd michael krolick + her need to get together asap there good for eachother in my eyes but thats all i can really say on that subject . . 

i noticed that i was being classified as a complete scumb bag / pot head by alot of ppl for awhile even ppl i seemed to be really close with that really pissed me off and right now i dont have alot of trust for people .. my family has just gone down the shitter there really nasty to me and now its just a bitch nd wen u think u have ppl who are gunna have ur back they go nd tell u wut a fuck up u are and everything else im just sick of everyone bitching at me basically . . im always here for my friends but i just dont like being bitched at all the time .  . yeah i needed to vent soo if your still reading this ur preety tuff cuz that was rough for me to get out but i just need to kno that ppl want to help me start over wit my life i need to get back on the right track before i just end up somewhere i shuldnt be =/ 

edit :
its great how people talk soo much shit about a person but when they talk to them there soo nice + fake to them . . i dont understand wuts going on with you and i guess u just want our friendship to end so consider it done if thats how you want it sorry i cant be fuckin perfect

* tOo hell with yOo and all yOor friends *"

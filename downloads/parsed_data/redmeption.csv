Lazy huh ?? You're a bit slow in getting going - <br>and tend not to do anything unless it is<br>absolutely necessary. You'd rather sit around,<br>watch TV/Sleep then go out and about with<br>friends, or take part in a sporting event. On<br>the positive side, you tend to be quite smart,<br>as you spend a lot of time watching the News<br>(!!) or on the computer, Also by conserving<br>your energy, it's right there waiting for you<br>when it's vitally important to get going.
Consider possibly moving out of the room once in a<br>while - and perhaps once a week trade watching<br>TV for half an hour with a walk - and you'll be<br>back on track.
However, Congratulations on being the most<br>intelligent of the 7 deadly sins...

I got banned from my first club, yup I got banned! 
What for you may ask!

I got banned because I didn't know what to do after the player in my thread left, and I posted asking what to do.

For those in the know it was Gothics game so go figure.

Anyways on a brighter note, I found an amazing vampire rpg, If you want the link let me know, its all yours, the people that read it are the nicest people.

They made the entry into the game so much easier, so thanks to them, not that they read this but neah!

I get to play Marcus again, properly, so yipee for me and shame for them, I also get to play Hex so its all good!

Um my god was the larp last night boring, what the hell is it with these people, I mean its a game, you meet every month to rp but you sit around OOC so much its pointless!

Oh in case you havn't noticed I've been doing test galore recently, instead of doing work in class, no thats not true, I talk to people in class when I'm supposed to be working.lol

Um so until I decide to write stuff down again, or I take some other mad tests I guess I'll catch you all later."

So far I'm not impressed, life seems to be the same, so no big change then.

I would like to say however that people are just plain strange, I mean things move on, stuff changes yet some people just never let go?

Bizarre I know, I would like to thank my friends, the ones that actually remember I exist for the support and the happiness they bring me.

So anyways, I think everyone should just chill, remember the world doesn't end until I say so.

Um I sent a card to a friend but have no idea if she got it, she doesn't seem to be answering her comments, yes Meli I'm talking about you!
For crying aloud sent me an email or something! Anything! please!

I read two other peoples journals, I even left comments in one, for every entery up until recently.
I've decided to stop doing that, I getting the feeling they are ignored, so blah.
Recently I've been taking stock of things that important to me, its weird when you try to put your life into perspective, you'd think you'd work it all out, it doesn't quite work that way.

I seem to only have a few friends, not that I'm complaining, I like the fact I have so few, the ones I have mean so much more to me because of that.
So I know one of them reads this, so to you my good sir, thanks, my life is ever better for the friendship you bring to me.
Much pigeons and snugs for you!
My girlfriend, well she really is the greatest thing on earth, without her, well I won't dwell on that.

I thought I had friends online, but it seems that the abandon you after so long, some only wish to fuel their ego, to be told how great they are, some it seems wish to find out that your life is so much worse than theirs.
I'm not pointing fingers at anyone, if I wanted to do that I'd name them, I guess today I'm feeling dejected, I get that we all have problems, some even fake them for attention, yet theres other people that have been to dark places, to know what its like to have six minutes of the eight bleed in front of you, to know what it feels like to understand that your only reason for existance is to steal other peoples oxygen.
Yet if people like me can get pat the years of shit, why can't others, was the feelings I had no worse than theirs, or was mine a mild case, if so then poor you lot.

Anyway, that word again, I'm not really wanting to bitch and complain, or even look for complements, or anything like that, just have things I need to get off my chest.

What I'm getting at is do you really know who your real friends are?
Are they always there when you need them?
Can you trust them all, with everything you need to tell them?"

Anyway I'm going to get some new books, proper novel type things!

If chins could kill, The bruce Campell autobiography, the mans a legand, GROOVY!
I also found a hard back illustrated version of the Devils Dictionary, so I'm so happy.

As for Life stuff?
Well my house is warm. I have hot water, and amazing girlfriend, she really is the light and darkness of my life!

Anyways, I can play my PS2 again, so I'm so happy!!!!
My games are going well, mostly, hehehehe.
If you don't play in them all why not!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Anyways....I say that a lot huh!

If you live real far away, then I'll put you up if you want to come here on holiday, why would you?
Anyways..again...I hope that my personal demons are keeping you all safe and well.
Just remember Life is like a box of chocolates, no thats not right...ehm...hate leads to anger....nope...ehm...Life is like a beached whale...argh!

Nothing exciting happens to me anyways.

"event","<P>So, I posted here once. It's kinda habit to post on blogdrive.com. But if I could only learn to make nifty layouts here, I'd probably be more inclined to use it. I like a lot of the options better than at blogdrive.com. </P>
<P>Anyways, so like I said over in the blogdrive world.... not much of real excitement in my life lately. Mostly just Theatrix, Library, AGYG rehearsal, Cameron, sleep. Occasionally ""AGYG rehearsal"" is replaced by ""Dollar Tuesday"" or ""D&amp;D,"" but definately not this week. M-Th, rehearsals every night. *le sigh* </P>
<P>In other news, I had fun at Perkins with Travis and Lindsay the other night, making fun of the myriad of Fox Cities residents who obviously do not own a mirror. I may not be... I <U>am not</U> drop dead gorgeous, but at least I try to dress to make the best of my imperfections. I still maintain that the 40-something-year-old lady in the fuzzy cerelean tube top was the best. Priceless. </P>
<P>Also, I hung out with Nichole and ""the gang"" (being Kyle, Paul, Spencer, Tonie, Cameron, Jon &amp; Tommy) on Saturday night. Cameron and I played chess for awhile, while the boys played Halo and Nichole and Tonie downloaded music, and then we all played Catch Phrase and Who's The Biggest Pervert?. </P>
<P>Earlier last week, Cameron and I went to see <U>Sahara</U> at Cheap Seats with Laura and Monica.&nbsp; Good times, good times.&nbsp; And Sunday night, Jess and I went to T.G.I.Fridays and then hung out at her mom's house with Ed until I had to go home at midnight.</P>
<P>Theatrix is going well - Cinderella &amp; Grease, for those of you who don't know - and should actually be fairly well organized this year, if all goes well for Nichole and me.&nbsp; (That is actually grammatically correct, but doesn't it sound funny - ""Nichole and me""?)</P>
<P>Anyways, I'm off to amuse myself for the hour of work that I have left and then it's home for dinner and off to rehearsal for 30 minutes.&nbsp; Woot.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Ciao!</P>

"event","Hm.  Kinda bored with Blogdrive.  No real reason... just playing around.

I'm feeling rather pissy tonight.  People frustrate me.  Maybe I'm just retarded.  I'm considering using this blog as a ""Bitch about people since they don't know about this blog"" blog, but I don't know yet.

I have a really hard time with people who have adopted the ""If they really want to spend time with me, they'll call me.  I'm not calling them."" philosophy.  It's bullshit, really.  Because, guess what?  If ""they"" are really important to you, then you will be willing to put forth the effort and call them.  And if ""they"" aren't important enough for you to call them, then maybe you should just tell them that you don't give a shit about them.

That is all."

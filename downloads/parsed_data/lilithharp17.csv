One bag full of blessings
Money and Sweets
Ice Cream Blessings
With Fudge and Whip Cream
One Cherry blessing on top!

No depressed thoughts, bringing back

All my energy bubbling inside me
Awaiting the movement of father-time

My joy will be in the miracle 
Of it all...For I am ever moving

I don't like; how the live journal, does not let you put in a username and it will call up a journal.  It makes it hard to read your journal, if like I did, you lose your password.

Are squelched for the long, horrendous lows

Current music: Dear Mr. DJ - Dedicated to Robby the DJ of DaBomb Radio 

Dragon and Lilith


The Dragon In me..Is marching by four giant claws. 
I turn my head and that takes so much time. 
The wizard, does not know That I exist. 
The Princess is His Damsel in Distress! 

Her flowing dress, undresses all by itself, 
before my dragon-self. I will barbecue her. 
Why her pretty face wiil be a mess. 
Hope someone Tries their best to do a rescue--Woot! 

I am feeling pretty good for being so very, very old. 
The soil beneath my feet, Is brown, 
and the fire coming out of my yaw, 
is immensely; forensicly-Hot! 

Oh, her skin, looks so tender, 

I really hate to Burn her. 
If you only knew, 
what good Virgin Tastes Like....
You would not begrudge me this morsel, 
honest. And there she is, 

why, she looks like 
the one and only Lilithharp17...... 
And she is not smiling much, 
she has the eyes of 
burnt-deep sapphire. 

What, does she mean, 
she is not perfect? 
She says, that animals
are her friends... If I eat her 
she will arise and 
come out of my mouth, 

and fly away like a Dove. 
Whomever, made her, does not realize, 

This girl seems very crazy. 
She has no fear. She just keeps looking at me. 

She sees value in my green

and ruby scales. I adorn myself, 
for my own amusement, you see,

I  am very old, got bored, v
aroom and lots of fire an heat 
come out of me. I am magnificient. 

Lilthharp, is so tiny, and white. 
She did not even take the chiffon-off; 
her skin for me. I had to melt it off of her. 


Does anyone know if she has an inkling, 

of what my fire will feel like to her. 
Or is she just going to Die and Forget 
She0Ever-Was? I am amazed that, that 
woman or whatever I see from my green eyes...
why she has one tear, for me, not her. 

Does that mean that I should eat her now, 
or see if she will do a little begging thing? 
Oh see, how she pulls out a flute. 
Such a beautiful, ruby flute. 

I think her long brown hair, is about as straight 
as it can get in this heat and wonder where her 
dry lips find air--with my fire all around her? 
As, she puts her dry lips to her flute, 

her bare feet begin to tap, the birds;

they are coming in and swooping 
all around her head, and look over there. 
Over there by the hill not far off.... 

The Wizard has found me and I smile. 
Who the Hell does He think He is? 
I know how to cook, Wizard and Lilithharp ..
all together, without thinking about 
her or him. Well, her first, then him. 

Beware, of flutes. That is all I can say. 
Look yonder, there are carrion now! I see the jackal coming to help her. Damn I hate those bastards! 

They always steal my food, man! 
Come on, leave my Dragon alone, 
you dirty-tooth-group of beasies! Oh Hell! 

I was enjoying this. Now I have some 
gazelle galloping close, 

and over the other horizon, 
Damn, there are men. Who the Hell, 
does this wizard think he is? Now arrows. 

They won't hurt me much. They must get close, 
before they can gut me with 'em. I am a Fine,
Good-Looking-Dragon, built by my Ancestors 
to feel so dynamite-cool. 

You, Only-Have-To-Look

 Look at my Steady-Gaze... 

And; I love that flute-music, now! 

Go on Lilithharp! 
Make my foreclaws stomp about. 

I want to see 

Where she is again? 

Now there is too much smoke about. 

I thought I had her. Gonna go around the 
bend her and up to her. Maybe, I can swallow 
her whole, Get the: Fuck-Outta-Heah! 
Before I can, that Damn Wizard has me 

With men, and a fucking diamond studded Net! 
Just when I thought he would be defeated! 
Well,anyway, this is the End-of-Me! I
I should have guarded my gold! 
Gotten Rid-Of-The-Wizard!"

It presses me to analyze my feelings
Makes me burn for excitement and good health
Helps me stay aware of my priorities

My journal is me
My journal, hopefully
Is of interest to others
My contributions to this journal
Is a big part of my being

Today, I am a more serious writer
Not as fun as my earlier entries

I hope my journal friends know
I have life issues to battle.
Fighting Dragons was yesterday year
This year, I have less bounce

Thank  you journal friends for helping me
Your written word, keeps me writing too"

Such a wonderful gift.
Now, my days are lonely
You've forgotten us.

I remember our love
I find it hard to forget
Maybe, one day it will happen
I will accept our separation well

Hold on to what you love
Never, forsake it in anger
However, you live
Time will tell you, how to cope

These days, I'm sad
Forgotten and On the sidelines
I hope, I can move on with my life
Forever, in your debt

"event","<u>J R</u> by William Gaddis

It basically took me a whole month to read this tome. Plus also I'm reasonably certain I gave myself a repetitive stress injury in the reading of it - it's sort of singlehandedly a strong argument for e-readers.

The novel itself is really funny in a kind of slapstick / rude wordplay kind of way. It sort of reads like someone took the character of (I think) Milo Minderbinder from Keller's <u>Catch-22</u>, and wrote a novel solely based around him."

"event","<u>Europe Central</u> by William Vollman

On Goodreads, I reviewed this book saying,
""There's a bit near the end where the corrugations of a waffle remind a melancholic (if memory serves) Shostakovich of the skeletal remains of a bombed out city block. Which is about the bleakest language I've ever seen used to describe breakfast.

I liked this novel a fair bit. It's something like 3/4s intensely rigorous historical textbook, and 1/4 heartbreakingly beautiful prose.

It's also kind of a pitiless bitch to get through, though. Prepare to put in some work for this one.""

Which is pretty much still my stance on this one. I'm sort of half glad/self-impressed that I read it, and half entirely glad that I don't have to read it any more. I did learn a ton reading it, which is not always true of fiction, or even  of historical fiction.

There is some drop-dead gorgeous prose in this novel though, man.

""Between exploit and recompense lay only four days, which in most histories would compromise but an ellipsis between words, a quartet of periods, thus: . . . . - but which, if through close reading we magnify them into spheres, prove to contain in each case a huddle of twenty-four grey subterranean hours like orphaned mice; and in the flesh of every hour a swarm of useless moments like ants whose queen has perished;""

""Rockets are sacred because their mission is to approach the ideal. And with each new generation, right up to the V-weapons and beyond, they become more themselves. Their slimness grows more elegant, their tapering payloads more aerodynamic. But now that the war's over and they're perfect, nobody cares. Isn't that sad?""

""Whenever his fingertips settled upon a piano, the white keys took on a brilliance as lovely as icicles on a roof when the late-afternoon sun touches them, while the black keys became slits in the whiteness of the world, holes which gaped from meaning all the way down to pure music. What was he to do? Lost, deliciously dazzled, he played the ineffable.""

""One of life's best pleasures is reading a book of perfect beauty; more pleasurable still is rereading that book; most pleasurable of all is lending it to the person one loves... she who is so lovely is drinking in the loveliness I've drunk.""

""All that's happened is inconsequential; it cannot hurt us anymore; there's only music, which lives within us and beyond us, needing us to express it but capable of surviving forever between expressions.""


etc etc. Like, man, when this book was on point it was serious business.

<u>Taipei</u> by Tao Lin

This was a horse of an entirely different colour. It was kind of funny going from reading this huge, densely researched book, full of metaphor and allusion and rhetoric, to a slim memoir thats only research was that of the directly lived experience, and that goes to pains to avoid referencing anything other than itself.

Which, this may not say anything good about me, but while I went back and forth on enjoying Vollman's dense tome, I pretty unambiguously loved <i>Taipei</i>.

Quotes! This one's while in his apartment, on drugs, ""finally allowing the simple insistence of the ovoid, like an undending chord progression with a consistently unexpected and pleasing manner of postponing resolution, to accumulate and expand, until his brain and heart and the rest of him were contained within the same song-like beating - of another, larger, protective heart - inside of which temporarily safe from the outside world, he would shrink into the lunar city of himself and feel and remember strange and forgotten things.""

""In his previous relationships, he knew, he had experienced dissatisfaction, to some degree, as an empirically backed enthusiasm for the future, because it implied the possibility of a more satisfying relationship with someone he hadn't met; with Michelle, whom he felt closer to than his previous girlfriends... dissatisfaction felt more like a personal failing, a direct indication of personal malfunctioning, which he should focus on privately correcting. Instead, he vaguely knew, he was waiting for Michelle, or some combination of Michelle and the world, to endure and overpower his negativity - to be the solution in which he would irreversibly, untraceably dissolve.""

After doing drugs for such a long period of time that they have begun to impact his memory, ""Having repeatedly learned from literature, poetry, philosophy, popular culture, his own experiences, most movies he'd seen, especially ones he'd liked, that it was desirable to 'live in the present,' 'not dwell in the past,' etc., he mostly viewed these new obstacles to his memory as friendly, and, sometimes, momentarily believing their viability as a form of Zen, exciting or at least interesting.""

<u>We're Flying</u> by Peter Stamm

I tend to like short stories a lot, and also to like Peter Stamm a lot. In keeping with these two preferences, I liked this collection of short stories by Peter Stamm a lot.

""That was an advantage animals had over humans, for them memory was only experience, and not another world in which you could lose yourself.""

And then just today I read <u>Signifying Rappers</u> by David Foster Wallace and Mark Costello. Which, it's essentially a self-agonizing essay about rap which turns out to be kind of basically silly, but DFW just has such a wonderful voice that it was hard for me not to enjoy it anyway."

"event","I think these are sort of fun anecdotes as much for the contrast as anything else.

The first was a show at a local bar. The bar is pretty hip just on it's own merits - it's called <i>Handlebar</i>, it's a relatively new bar in my neighborhood (the itself pretty hip Kensington Market). It's got a beautiful little front patio, well-thought out interior layout/design/general vibe, exquisite kitsch choice and placement, and is just kind of generally what you want from a trendy local watering hole.

The show was a DJ and three different bands. A helpful way to possibly describe the sound of the bands is to envision the movie <i>Blade Runner</i>. If Harrison Ford had stopped fighting robots or whatever, and had instead gone to see a random house band at the local dystopian futurebar, that band would probably have sounded a lot like these ones.

Which, I actually liked them a fair bit, I guess I just mean that synths were strongly represented in the overall sound of the night. 

So, like, the first band (a skinny boy with a beiber haircut, who looked like he needed a hug and a lasagne, playing a (yes) synthesizer, accompanying a stout lass in a floral dress on the keyboard) played a song called ""fucking on the moon"", which is probably what I would have named the song too, because they just kind of repeated ""fucking on the moon"" and sometimes ""the motherfucking moon"" over and over again with huge reverb and immense irony.

Every once and awhile members of the audience would kind of look at each other and sort of eye-contact high five, like ""can you believe the genius we are privilege to? Taste and discernment have brought us here, truly we are the cultural elite.""

The audience, actually, was kind of itself a highlight for me. It seemed like a group of people that spent a fair bit of time/energy on being cool (which, I should be clear, I don't really buy into the sort of faux-hipsterbashing that you see in like NOW magazine or whatever - I actually genuinely appreciate the hip of Toronto, and enjoy opportunities to people watch in places populated by them).

After the show, I went over and talked to a barista I recognized. Her gay friend looked down my v neck, complimented me on my body hair, and then talked about rimming for what seemed like a really long time (he was for it, was basically the takeaway).

--

Last night I went to a book launch for a Hamlet choose your own adventure book (which, I guess it was also a book launch for a short story collection centred around a machine that predicts how you die - both books by authors whose fame/audience comes largely or possibly entirely from their internet-based endeavours). It was super lovely. It was also kind of the polar opposite of an impossibly hip bar full of self-aware well-dressed hipster youth.

The crowd was gawky but exuberant. It felt like, as a crowd, probably most of these people didn't get out much, and was sort of impressed at how much fun they were having (In the ""About"" section of his dinosaur comics website, Ryan North includes a mini how-to for ""Interacting socially"", saying, ""This can be tricky! You want to be friendly, but you don't want to come on too strong. My best advice is to carefully observe others, and to relax!""). Unshielded earnestness ran high.

There was a kind of exhilarating/absurd celebrity-watching component to the whole thing as well. My friends and I (hopefully basically) discretely pointing out local/internet heroes we admired to one another (One friend I was with was entirely there to catch a glimpse of Joey Comeau. At another point we googled Kate Beaton to find out what she looked like, and see if she was there, only to be thrilled/slightly abashed that she was something like a foot away from us in the crowd).

The event seemed half-improvised (there tended to be fifteen minute intervals between the scheduled entertainment where the organizers would kind of huddle, and seemed to be saying to one another ""Ok, so now what?""), but in kind of a wonderful way. The highlight for me was probably a 20-minute rendition of <i>Hamlet</i>, which, as an encore included a two-minute rendition of Hamlet, and then another two-minute rendition, this time backward.

So, yeah, that's what I've been up to, I guess."

We reply that we don't smoke. The bartender kind of stares out into the distance for a while.

Then, totally casually, heads back into the bar.

"event","""Five years later, I know the world much better, but it's still almost always impossible for me to distinguish change from revelation."" from <u>The Instructions</u>

Semi-distant reading.

<u>The Instructions</u> by Adam Levin

I picked this one up without knowing anything about it, purely because of its ridiculous size. It is a hilariously massive tome. It's actually kind of a beautiful artifact - it's hardbound with some sweet ass foil stamping - it's hefty and textured and lovely.

The book itself is pretty good too. While the book as artifact benefits from the enormous page count, the plot probably doesn't. The prose seems very informed by philosophical logic - everything is very rigorously structured and outlined, I think probably to communicate the way the mind of the protagonist, Gurion Maccabee, works. The brilliant parts are really brilliant, and the first 600 or so pages of the novel sail by, but it sort of felt like Levin lets the book get away from him at some point, and never totally gets it back.

<u>A Pale View of Hills</u> by Kazuo Ishiguro

I feel like I probably just didn't get this one. I think Ishiguro is pretty wonderful, but I didn't really take away anything of value from reading this book.

<u>All the Pretty Horses</u> and <u>The Crossing</u> by Cormac McCarthy
McCarthy has written some beautiful, literary stuff, but for the most part I'd describe these two books as ""extremely capable Westerns."" While I was reading <u>All the Pretty Horses</u> some guy told me that it was Brad Pitt's favourite book. Which made me feel briefly connected to celebrity?

Some of the dialogue was in Spanish, which I don't speak a word of, and I had a bit of an internal battle over whether to type everything into Google translate on my phone, or just keep open a list of translated dialogue. Typing things out my own self was semi-arduous/time consuming, but when I used the pre-translated list I tended to end up skimming, and had trouble retaining the gist of what was going on. I ended up mostly going the route of typing and translating phrases individually.

<u>The Ghost Writer</u> by Philip Roth
This was so good it was kind of intoxicating. It felt like the literary equivalent of getting high. I'd never read any Roth before, but I guess I'm going to have to get on that."

Having placed his flawed and needy children in a world of exacting specifications, he deducts the difference between what we have and what we need from our hearts and our self esteem and our mental health."" - from <u>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline</u>

Long-distant reading.

<u>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline</u> and <u>Pastoralia</u> by George Saunders
More short stories by George Saunders. He's funny and charming. I've ended up enjoying <u>Tenth of December</u> the most, Goodreads tells me that's statistically not the norm. I wonder if it isn't a first point of contact thing. I really liked every story collection, but probably liked every subsequent one I read slightly less. I guess the problem with mainlining an author like that is that you notice repetitive qualities they might have in a pretty big way.

My boss Larry lent me a couple more books that deal with Native American issues. I liked <u>Neither Wolf Nor Dog</u> by Kent Nerburn a fair bit. It's nonfiction - Kent Nerburn basically goes and talked to this older Indian guy about his feelings in regard to the colonialist takeover of North America and the race relations today. It's such a monumentally awful thing to have been perpetrated it can be kind of difficult to grapple with, and I think this book does about a good a job as any I've seen. In some ways it was helpful for my reading that the author is a white guy who, while not an apologist exactly, is definitely uncomfortable about some of the heritage-based baggage he's bringing to the table in the discussion.

The other one he lent me was <u>Green Grass, Running Water</u> by Thomas King. I think this must be on a lot of Canadian high school english curriculums - the whole time I was reading it, I was constantly being approached by fresh faced university student to tell me how much they had loved reading that book. Which, I didn't really get that much out of it, to be honest. I usually love overly clever post-modern fiction, but this novel kind of turned me off with its over-cleverness. There were some straightforward human relationships type plot arcs that I thought were okay, though.

<u>Seven Years</u> by Peter Stamm
It's about an architect who's got a lovely, talented wife, and a sort of crazy, unlovely mistress-of-sorts, and how he doesn't really like either of them that much, and the extent to which that makes his life miserable. Stamm does a really amazing job of pinning down and expressing ulterior motives that I think probably exist in many or even most relationships, but don't tend to see much direct expression. So, like, the protagonist takes most of the pleasure in his relationship with his mistress from the power he feels like he wields over her, which I think ""enjoyment of a power dynamic"" is a pretty common feature in a lot of relationships, but Stamm expresses it in such a graceful, non-clunky way that it's just kind of a pleasure to read.

<u>Room</u> by Emma Donoghue
Stressed me right out. Told from the perspective of a boy who has lived his entire life with his mother as a captive in some psychopath's secret sex dungeon. Kind of light reading, but I figure I'm allowed."

<u>Henderson the Rain King</u> by Saul Bellow is a kind of magnificent book. It isn't really the kind of story that could be written today. The plot is basically an unhappy wealthy American travels to Africa to find himself, and goes on a journey of self-discovery aided by characters who I think fit the ""noble savage"" archetype pretty categorically. One of those outsider-stumbles-into-invented-tribe-and-is-crowned-god/king kind of stories. It's the kind of story that we (I think rightfully) find problematic today.

It is also, though, also amazing. Bellow is on to some real transcendently beautiful stuff.

Which, plus, he does seem kind of self aware through the whole thing. There are enough small subversive departures from the archetypal narrative that it sort of feels like he might be making fun of it. It seems like the kind of book that would have been fun/contentious to discuss in a classroom setting.

""A hit B? B hit C? - we have not enough alphabet to cover the condition. A brave man will try to make the evil stop with him. He shall keep the blow.

"event","<u>Something Fierce: Memoirs of a Revolutionary Daughter</u> by Carmen Aguirre

I sort of love-hated this memoir. It's a really nuts story, you get the sense that she's lead a really interesting life. Bizarrely, I probably would have liked it more if it was like four times larger. There were so many crazy situations, both personal and political, that I would have liked to dig into a lot more, but Aguirre keeps the narrative moving at a really really fast rate, a lot of time (I felt) at the expense of adding details, or really digging into the meat of things.

Except! We spend a <i>lot</i> of time examining her schoolyard crushes, which do make some commentary about how class operated in the school systems she attended, but mostly manage to be pretty conventional schoolyard romances for all that. I don't normally take the more politics! less steamy bits! approach to entertainment, but I actually probably could have gone in for a slightly different ratio.

It's also true that (probably as a result of going through the American school system, and so systematically not really looking at some of the awful things the USA has done in South America) I was basically totally ignorant about a lot of the politics that Aguirre talks about. For most chapters I had to do a quick supplementary wikipedia article scan, which isn't terrible in itself, but, speaking for myself, I would have benefited from a more annotated account. I'm still not totally sure I understand how the revolutionary underground that Carmen Aguirre (and her entire family) were a part of operated - this may have mimicked the amount of knowledge she herself would have had as a child, or even as an underground agent purposefully kept unaware of sensitive information she might reveal under torture, but it seems like the whole point of a memoir is that you have the benefit of looking back and filling in information that was missing to you at the time.

I'd actually totally recommend the book - it's just a crazy way for someone to have grown up. I do now feel like I need to go out and do a lot of reading about essentially all of Central/South American history because, dang. There was really just a lot of stuff alluded to that I probably should have just known about off the bat."

"event","""Dale gave Kiwi what appeared to be an enormous cardboard coaster. It folded out into a kind of daisy-chain checklist of the forces working counter to the lifeguard

THE DROWNING CHAIN

Lack of Education
Lack of Protection
Lack of Safety Advice

<u>Swamplandia!</u> by Karen Russell is a bit of an odd read. It's got a dreamlike quality that almost approaches - but does not ever quite become - magical realism. The sometimes otherworldly characters and settings can sort of trick you into thinking that the tone of the novel is light, but it's deceptive, because basically from start to finish every character seems headed towards their own personalized disaster.

I wasn't totally sure how much I liked it. There are some really beautiful turns of phrase scattered throughout the novel, but also a lot of fairly clunky attempts at beautiful turns of phrase that don't quite succeed. Also, there were significant stretches of the novel that I think I could basically just have done without (the ""Mama Weeds"" fable, and actually basically all of Ossie and Louis Thanksgiving's pseudo-romance I found kind of a drag to get through). Plus, also, given how young Russell is, it's odd how genuinely terrible the youth culture slang is.

I loved <u>St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised By Wolves</u>, and in truth will probably read the next thing Karen Russell authors (or, I think she's got another collection out now, and probably I'll read that at some point) on the strength of that collection alone, but I don't know that I'd especially recommend <u>Swamplandia!</u>"

"event","I'm fear-paused midway through watching <i>The Mist</i> right now. It's a monster film that is I guess also kind of a parable about 9/11 (or, anyway, I read an article to that effect, and thus far it's mostly bearing out).

Probably the only reason I'd need to fear-pause it at all is that I'm basically a huge wuss - it takes precious little to put the fear in me, turns out. 

But I do also recognize that there's something basically silly about a film in which suburban Americans are living in fear of, like, the animal kingdom. Weather films (like <i>Twister</i>, or that one where the world ends, or whatever) seem to address a real fear that can and maybe should exist for people. Global warming is a thing. Earthquakes, hurricanes, all that good stuff, real problems that the suburban sprawl are in no way immune to. It's kind of funny to be watching a film where scary animals are the threat, because it's got this kind of anachronistic component to it.

Which is in no way stopping me from being all like ""Wa!"" and pausing every time a scary beast shows up on screen."

"event","<u>Tenth of December</u> by George Saunders

My favorite line to come out of this collection is actually the excerpt that got me interested in reading it in the first place. A character has been paid to muck out a neighbor's pool, and realized midway through that there are a ton of transitional tadpole-frog babies living in the muck, and as he's shovelling out the pool, he is (horrifically) killing them.

""It was like either: (A) I was a terrible guy who was knowingly doing this rotten thing over and over, or (B) it wasn't so rotten, really, just normal, and the way to confirm it was normal was to keep doing it, over and over.""

Which is sort of Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"" concept reduced to a single sentence.

I basically liked every story in this collection a fair bit. Saunders seems really interested in our growing cultural tendency to chemically alter our moods - there are a couple stories that hinge around chemicals like prozac, or adderall, but with much more specific and esoteric effects. The sci-fi elements had a kind of Vonnegut wackiness to them, where even though what was actually happening on the page verged on being a joke, the stories still end up feeling emotionally hard-hitting/compelling. There were a few times reading this collection where I was genuinely stressed out by the story I was on.

My favorite story takes the form of a company e-mail, and it's a little frustrating, but I don't really feel like I can write about it without spoiling what makes it so good, and it's just way too good a story to seriously contemplate spoiling. So, yeah, in conclusion, do read <u>Tenth of December</u>, or at least ""Exhortation"" if the opportunity arises."

""you merely set the words down as they come, or long since came: once-living creatures caught and fossilized in the clay; bones displaced by alien mineral, grown with crystals, hued with the oxides of old corrosion, heaved and worn and rearranged by the eons' ebb; shards; disjecta membra, from which the sleeping dragon is ever harder to infer.""

I would recommend this book for people who enjoy: alliteration, post modernism, the greeks, penis jokes.

So, everyone, basically.

It's fun. The most post modern, which I am totally okay with. Some (not all!) of the gender dialogue feels a bit dated, so mileage may vary there.

"event","I'm going to gracefully soar right past the fact that last time I wrote up feelings about books I've read, I said I was going to try to write about books as I read them, with greater depth/thought put into it. And sort of summarize impressions of things I've read since Moby Dick, back in like November.

<u>Things Fall Apart</u> by Chinua Achebe
I see a lot of students at the university reading this one. I liked it fine, but in all honesty can hardly remember much of the plot at this point. What an excellent book review, I'm sure future James will look back at this and be glad that he wisely documented his fantastical journey though literature, and grow spiritually/intellectually.

<u>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</u> by David Foster Wallace
I actually didn't really love this collection. Which, okay, I love David Foster Wallace immensely, and can think of very few authors who have had as large an influence on me than he has. But! I'm pretty sure I've enjoyed just about every other thing he's written more than this collection. And also, the stories that I did enjoy are ones that I'd read before, in other formats.

<u>Every Love Story is a Ghost Story: A Life of David Foster Wallace</u> by D. T. Max
My friend Alex Shave recommended this to me. At first I was really worried about this one, it starts out with this saccharine ""David was a very special boy whose mother loved him very much"" type dealie, and I kind of mentally braced myself for some generic biography brainlessness. But it pretty quickly got interesting, I guess as a result of DFW pretty quickly becoming actually interesting. By the end D. T. Max is throwing in all kinds of low-key literary theory to talk about DFW's aspirations/challenges, and its actually pretty great. DFW turns out to be way more of a creeper weirdo than I knew, which is kind of fun to have learned about. I still love him pretty unconditionally though.

<u>Unformed Landscape</u> by Peter Stamm
I've recommended this to basically everyone I've talked books to since I've read it. It's really, really lovely. My girlfriend's mother works for the CBC radio show ""writers and company"", I guess told Peter Stamm via e-mail that I had read this book and liked it, and he replied that ""your daughter's boyfriend seems like a very nice man."" Which, I think the whole exchange is a little bit too cute for words.
Um! But the book. It's just very simple and beautiful. The protagonist, Kathrine, just kind of takes this semi-disassociated look at how base-level unsatisfying her life, and her relationships are. It's kind of a story about a breakdown, or mid-life crisis, but it seemed to me to avoid a lot of the narcissism that often hangs over that kind of story. Which, I feel like I'm not selling this book strongly enough, but you should definitely read it because then and only then will you know what it means to be happy.

<u>The Coxon Fund</u> by Henry James
Henry James seems like someone I would enjoy reading in the context of a classroom, with insight coming from someone educated and professorial, and conversation with other English-nerd peers, but the language is a little dated/dense for me to really enjoy him reading for my own pleasure. This novella is a comedy, and the jokes are mostly pretty funny, even, but I was pretty glad when I finished it, because that meant I wouldn't have to read any more Henry James for awhile. His vocabulary is kind of amazing. I think my favorite new word to come out of this story is eleemosynary, of relating to, or dependent on charity.
The story follows this wind-bag intellectual, who draws patronage from society members who are in awe of his potential, but can't seem to actually produce anything (papers, lectures, etc.) There's also this kind of dead-serious, melancholic love-triangle going on. Not totally my bag.

<u>Three Day Road</u> by Joseph Boyden
So Canadian! Two Canadian Cree men enlist and are sent over to Europe during WWI. Vimy's there, Passchendaele, all this stuff I would probably know tons about if I'd grown up in Canada. I don't love war stories, but this book was actually pretty magnificent. I read this because I had a conversation with my boss at Victoria College Food Services, and I guess one of his passions in life is native Canadian literature, which, this certainly seems to qualify. It did mean that I started this novel with more a sense of obligation than anything else, but I ended up thinking it was pretty great. So that's nice.

<u>Then We Came to the End</u> by Joshua Ferris
This is a humorous take on the experience of working within a large bureaucracy, sort of like <i>The Office</i> or some such. Other than P.G. Wodehouse, I don't really feel like I've ever had much luck with humorous fiction, and I wasn't crazy about this book, although it had some fun moments.

So, yeah, all that happened. I've got one more to add to the list, but I'm going to do it later, and do it right, dammit! Haha, as if."

This article on today's shifting gender narratives is really interesting to me.

It's sort of a throwaway line, but I actually thought it was interesting that the guy writing the essay, who transitioned from female to male, had to really rethink the social dynamic of touch. It touched a chord in me where I immediately recognized the statement as true, but am having trouble pinning down exactly what it means, socially/culturally/personally.

It was also nice to read something commenting on gender roles that seemed basically optimistic/life-affirming.

The comments section is <i>the worst</i>, though. It seems incredibly difficult to write intelligently about gender."

"event","Reading <u>Moby Dick</u> was probably the single best decision I will have made in 2012. I was sort of expecting a <i>Boy's Adventure Tale</i> along the lines of <u>Treasure Island</u>, or <u>A Journey to the Center of the Earth</u>. This book was not that. <u>Moby Dick</u>, it turns out, is this wonderful, overwhelming work of literature, rich in language and invention.

It's got, I think, probably the best dramatic monologues I've read in my life. They're <i>awesome</i>. When I call them awesome, I mean that with the full etymological heft of the word. Just awesome.

So, like, here we have Captain Ahab, who could out-brood Hamlet, ranting at some lightning:

""Oh! that clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here... Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.""

Pretty tough, right? 

Well, okay, and so you've got these amazing, hefty, <i>awesome</i> monologues, this basically Greek sense of drama, a base-level excellent premise to talk about the rise and fall of the monomaniacal Ahab, man's hubris/folly/all that good stuff that you kind of know about going in to the book, based off of its reputation (or, at least, I'm pretty sure that's what its reputation is. What I knew going in was the line ""Call me Ishmael"" and that the plot was in essence a tragedy in which men pursue a whale) but <u>Moby Dick</u> is also wonderfully fun and wise.

An example, very early on, is when Ishmael is invited to worship his cannibal buddy Queequeg's god/pagan idol totem/object of worship:

""I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth - pagans and all included - can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship? - to do the will of God - <i>that</i> is worship. And what is the will of God? - to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me - <i>that</i> is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.""

Pretty great."

"event","I feel like I might have been a little unfair to <u>King Jesus</u>, which was, in all fairness, an oddly compelling read.

So! the premise is that, as a result of elaborate intrigue and conspiracy, the prophet Jesus is actually the grandson of King Herod, and therefore the literal king of the Jews.

I feel like the best insight into the tone of the book comes from the first page, when the protagonist refers to the schism between the Gentile and Jewish Chrestians, saying, ""the very numerous Gentile converts to the Jewish faith, known as God-fearers, who had shrunk from circumcision... and were thus precluded from becoming honorary sons of Abraham""

Dry, wordy, scholastic, but containing a pretty hilarious penis joke if you're willing to parse it. ""Shrunk from circumcision"" is awesome. That's probably the funniest way Graves could have chosen to put that. They're not usually that crude, but the book is full of phrases like that, where there is definitely a joke happening, but not one that necessarily leaps out at the reader. Without a fairly high level of engagement, though, the wittiness and the layering of meaning that goes on in the prose gets lost pretty easily.

Another thing I really liked, but that I don't think was actually intended as humorous is that ""slut"" is used as a fairly casual rebuke a lot in the book. So, noblewomen will say things like ""Sluts! Hasten thyselves!"" to their servants semiregularly over the course of the novel. I found that pretty endlessly amusing, anyway.

Clearly I'm a very intelligent reader of literature. Here's a passage on the literal versus figurative interpretation of religious texts:

""The Pharisees well understood the tyranny of the written word. By Jesus's time the Law of Moses, originally established for the government of a semi-barbarous nation of herdsmen and hill-farmers, resembled a petulant great-grandfather who tries to govern a family business from his sick-bed in the chimney-corner, unaware of the changes that have taken place in the world since he was able to get about: his authority may not be questioned, yet his orders, since no longer relevant, must be reinterpreted in another sense, if the business is not to go bankrupt. When the old man says, for instance, 'It is time for the women to grind their lapfuls of millet in the qerns', this is taken to mean, 'It is time to send the sacks of wheat to the water-mill.'""

Which, that's sort of how I feel about literal interpretation of religious texts too!"

<u>At Swim-Two-Birds</u> by AKA Flann O'Brien
I actually went wildly back and forth between enjoying and not enjoying this book. The brilliant parts are really, really funny and intelligent. The painfully overwritten parts are probably deliberate but still excruciating to read. Worth reading if you enjoy: postmodernism, the Irish, the highly meta.

<u>Eating Animals</u> by Jonathan Safran Foer
Whoa nonfiction! Bit of a switch-up for me. Makes a pretty comprehensive case against the industrialized meat industry. Worth reading if you enjoy: vegetarianism, facts, conscientiousness.

<u>Don't Lets Go the the Dogs Tonight</u> by Alexandra Fuller
More nonfiction! This one's a memoir about growing up in Africa (mostly then-Rhodesia and Malawi). Really excellent! Worth reading if you enjoy: Africa, terrible parenting, firsthand accounts of interesting situations, excellent prose.

<u>King Jesus</u> by Robert Graves
Historical fiction! Just to ease myself back on the the fiction-train, I guess. I enjoyed this book more than I thought it would, but in all honesty it consists mainly in incredibly dry religious arguments punctuated by the occasional execution. Worth reading if you enjoy: ancient Judaism, incredibly subtle humor, subversiveness, wildly boring scholasticism.

There is a reasonably high chance that at least the next blog post I write about a book I've read will have a higher level of energy/interest invested in it. Attainable personal goals!"

"event","I'm like 45 minutes deep into the town hall debate right now. A young woman has just asked the candidates how they plan to reduce the gender equity gap. The difference in their answers is kind of amazing, and makes me think they're basically answering a different question. Romney talked about providing more flexible hours for women (so they can balance running a household with holding down a job) and general strengthening of the economy (so employers need to resort to hiring women in order to have enough qualified labor).

The question I think Romney heard was ""How can we provide a space for women to hold jobs while continuing to occupy their traditional role in the nuclear family?"" Which, I'm not sure was actually what was being asked.

I don't know. Found that kind of funny/revealing."

"event","I had never been to a memorial service for someone my own age before today.

Initially, I was not sure whether or not I should attend at all. Courtney was a friend that I respect and value, and a woman that I have known, through a large group of shared friends, for a fairly long time. Outside of that shared community, though, I would not say that we were especially close. Confusion seems to go hand in hand with sadness, and it was hard to know how best to honor her memory. I ended up deciding to go to her memorial service, but (although I am sure I would have been made welcome) that it would have felt intrusive for me to go to the less formal reception afterward.

I am glad that I went. This past week has been punctuated by moments of incredible, overwhelming sadness, but it has felt like sadness without any real understanding behind it. One man performed a song during the ceremony where he said, ""People keep telling me you've died"" which is exactly how it has felt. When I first got the call that Courtney had been killed in an accident, I rationally understood that there was no chance that this was just a mistake, or misunderstanding. I knew that the distraught friend calling me, who was assuming a huge emotional burden by letting Courtney's social circle know that she had died, would have no reason or desire to lie to me. I knew all this, but could not seem to reconcile my friend Courtney, vividly alive in memory, with the fact of her death.

Participating in her memorial was, for me, an incredibly useful tool for finally being able to make that mental and emotional connection. During the ceremony, one of Courtney's aunts read a passage from an academic essay Courtney had written. It is this side of her, the academic and intellectual, that I have had the most access to as a university friend. It was like a window to my own grief had been opened. In that moment it felt as if my consciousness had expanded until I was able to hold the thought of my living friend Courtney, the possibility of her death, and my own unfaceable sadness all at the same time.

It is a privilege to have known Courtney Arthur. It has been a privilege to be invited into the community created by her life, and a privilege to be allowed to grieve with them.

I feel like if you actually know what they're talking about, Obama was articulate and thoughtful, but Romney ended up putting a pretty charismatic spin on lots of terrible policy ideas. Like, the amount of heart Romney appeared to have saying he was going to defund PBS was unreal. ""Something something I love big bird, but is Sesame street worth selling our souls to China for"" I kind of wanted the subtitle [what an asshole] to pop up onscreen. But, you know, it didn't.

Also, Romney talking over everyone all the time was pretty obnoxious, and I wish there had been more of a preventative mechanism in place to deal with that. Like, visible timer or some such.

Also, he moved away from it later in the debate, but man it was killing me during the first half hour or so when Obama kept on pointing out all the ways he and Romney agree on things. Like, way to gloss over all the worst parts of Romney's campaign, and highlight the reasonable bits.

"event","This month has blown past. I moved, for the first time in like five years, which turned out to be a bitch-ton of work. I've put a lot of work into the new place though - patching holes, painting, general feng shuiing like crazy. Already the new space feels way more like home than the old. Previously I basically felt like either a fifth wheel, or, towards the end, like an unpaid building manager, neither of which was super conducive to ever feeling especially at home.

Speaking of ""things I've done this month"", I also went to Mexico, to a resort in Cabo, St. Lucas, for a destination wedding. That was pretty neat. I guess how destination weddings work is that the profit off of the guests tickets ends up basically paying for the tickets of the bride and groom, which is a little nutty to me. I've previously thought of weddings as these impossibly expensive things where you need to feed and entertain everyone you know. That, instead, they can serve as free tickets to sweet vacations is a bit of a revelation.

I had fun. The place is physically gorgeous - beautiful sandy beaches, impossibly blue skies/oceans, craggy rocks formations in interesting shapes. Basically the whole area seemed to be composed of fancy-times resorts, with ""town"" consisting of an unbroken chain of t-shirt outlets. I wouldn't say I learned anything about Mexico, especially, or myself, so it wasn't super Eat, Pray, Love-ey, but it was pleasant to float around in the sun for a week sipping mojitos.

During the ceremony, the couple preformed a ritual with three glass jars that I thought was really nice. They each started out with a jar filled with sand, representing their own personal history, personality, and experiences, and then, together, poured their own jars into a third, empty, jar, signifying the union of their lives. The minister said something along the lines of ""Just as you can never separate the grains of sand in this jar, so too your lives are inextricably bound together"". Totally nice.

Wait, okay, but, genre fiction.

Um, I haven't really had much psychic space/ actual time to read this month. I did read <u>Neuromancer</u>, by William Gibson, which I liked a lot. It was kind of amazing how directly it has informed a lot of other cultural objects I enjoy.

I also read <u>The Sisters Brothers</u> by Patrick deWitt, which was a totally enjoyable way to pass time on a plane to or from Mexico, but didn't have a huge amount of substance going for it. Which is sometimes/frequently okay! In all honesty if it had turned out to have a lot of substance, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed myself half as much on the plane.

William Kennedy's <u>Ironweed</u> I liked a fair bit. I think I like stories about rough n' tumble derelicts making their way through the world generally, but this one seemed actually pretty lovely. The world these unemployed vagrants live in seems impossibly ugly, with daydreaming, often in the form of bragging/lying to your fellow vagrants, being one of the only forms of escapism available. I felt very sad after reading this book for a pretty long time."

"event","One of the fun things about working as a temp at a catering company is that you get to do and see a lot of different things. Today I was a bathroom attendant at a fancy wedding that took place at the Royal Ontario Museum. A lot people people seemed genuinely curious about how I felt about the job, which is partially what is sparking me to blog about it. It wasn't strenuous work, but it was an exercise in cultivating patience and humility.

The worst part isn't actually directly any of the bathroomy stuff. I wasn't a janitor, or a maintenance guy, or security, and if anything got too sticky, in any sense of the word, I was to call one of those people. My job was an odd sort of vestigial labor meant to amplify I suppose the general class and luxury of the event. Mostly I smiled at people as they went in and out of the bathroom. Occasionally I would wipe the counters free of splashed sink-water, or replenish hand-towels, but even that was pretty minimal. The worst part of the job was a toss-up between the boredom (which, yes, did turn out to be excruciating) or the banter.

The commentary from the guests tended to range from pitying to patronizing. ""Is this really a job?"" people seem to wonder. Which, it's a little difficult to know how to respond to, because, while yes, it does seem to be a ridiculous and pointless job, the people who are startled your job exists are the same people who are seem to be willing to pay you a fair sum of money to occupy that job. You sort of want to respond, ""Yes, I see that hiring someone to do this is absurd, but are you sure you do?""

Sometimes people comment on how great your job is. This seems like a bit of a funny reaction to me. It's true that it isn't very difficult, but given that the people saying this tended to be extremely wealthy, it seemed like probably most of their jobs were pretty good too. 

Just as frequently people comment on how awful your job is. ""Do you really have to just stand here all day?"" or ""Jeez, are you being punished for something or what?"" This reaction I understood a little bit more. It's visibly pretty mind-numbing stuff, but it's probably neither the most boring nor the least dignified thing I've ever done for a paycheck. It was kind of hard knowing how to respond to this kind of comment. ""Yes, I'm not totally satisfied with the direction my life seems to be taking. I have many regrets, professional and personal. This morning, while I was putting on my vest and tie, I paused a moment to experience deep and overwhelming sadness,"" doesn't seem like a totally appropriate response. Also, the job just really isn't that terrible either. I'm glad I don't do it on a regular basis, but I probably wouldn't turn down similar shifts out of hand either,

Actually, though, the worst banter comes from your colleagues. Generally when working an event, there is a pretty good amount of solidarity between caterers, as long as no one is fucking up too terribly. The attitude is pretty much us-against-them, them being the customers, and while you're generally working very hard and likely not being treated that great, the behind the scenes camaraderie makes work end up feeling pretty fun. Kind of inexplicably, this totally seemed to dissolve during my shift today. Almost every server seemed to feel the need to tell me how lucky I was not be be working as hard as they were. It didn't really seem fair. Part of me wanted to say that probably my job wasn't as great as they think it was. Part of me wanted to ask why I should be made to feel bad because I was offered an apparently easy shift. What is the end game of someone telling you you aren't working as hard as they are? Luckily, this pretty much dissolved by the end of the shift as people realized I was literally standing next to a bathroom for hours at a time, and jealousy gave way to a grudging acknowledgment that my job also sucked.

So yeah! Next time you see a bathroom attendant, and wonder what he's thinking about, you have some understanding of the context in which they work!

You're welcome."

The indy was kind of a riot. Car races are totally baffling to me. It happened over the course of three days. On the first day cars did laps to see whether or not they qualified to race or not. On the second day they continued doing laps, it wasn't totally clear to me what the difference was, but the spectators seemed to think it was a little more intense. On the last day it's the big race, which the cars win by doing more laps. I got to drive around on a golf cart to fetch beer and such, so I felt very in the spirit of things.

"event","So, I was kind of surprised, upon firing up the ol' livejournal tab on safari, about the last time that I semi-mechanically blogged about something I'd read recently. Guys, I've read so many things! And the weird thing to me is, I actually had like internal blog posts written up that I guess I just never got around to typing and blasting out into the great unread infinity of the intensely personal blogosphere. What other things do I assume I've done that I've actually only ever just thought about? The mind reels.

Mostly it seems too late for me to have much of a desire to talk in any involved or meaningful way about these books. But! A big part of how I apparently measure my own self worth turns out to be mentally cataloguing fiction. So! A brief run-down is in order, I feel.

Yeah! So. <u>The Crying of Lot 49</u> by Thomas Pynchon. I felt proud of myself for picking up another book by Pynchon, especially after being sometimes unpleasantly overwhelmed by <u>Gravity's Rainbow</u>. I'm glad I went for it, because super loved this book. A large-ish portion of the novel is dedicated to the description of a parodic 16th century play. Which, man, if my education has prepared me for anything, it's a good parody of 16th century dramatic conventions. Also! It managed to be really intelligent and clever and subversive without my ever having the feeling that Pynchon was attempting to strangle me through the power of the written word. So that was nice.

Also! I read what I believe to be a complete collection of Grace Paley's short stories. She turns out to have had a really consistently strong literary career. A lot of other authors seem to have periods that I like more than others, or collections that seem great versus ones that seem not so great. But not Paley! Every once and awhile I'd hit a story I didn't like so much, and then think to myself ""Ah! This is it. The start of a decline."" But then the next stories would be super great, and I'd be wrong, because Grace Paley is amazing. I don't know that she influenced Lorrie Moore, but I'd actually be pretty surprised if she hadn't.

Genre fiction: I've read all the Game of Thrones books (*Dance of Ice and Fire series for you <i>nerds</i>. Except, Game of Thrones is a way better name. Good call, HBO series!). What's going to happen next? I have no way of knowing. Infuriating! Apparently he's written a bunch of other material in that universe, like, on the side, but I'm not sure I'm prepared to go deeper in that way. Yet.

Speaking of needing to go deeper. I was thinking earlier today about how much I didn't really like Inception. Remember watching that film? Maybe even being kind of impressed by parts of it? Can you still remember what it was about? I feel like most films that create drama by having exciting twists! and such remain memorable, at least for the impact of those twists. I tried to mentally piece together the plot of Inception today and basically got as far as ""something something dreams."" Plus also obviously the phrase ""we need to go deeper."" Which is actually pretty great.

Today I finished reading <u>Americana</u> by Don DeLillo, which I thought was really great. His novels seem to be pretty dense, and there's a fair bit of unpacking you can do for any given bit of writing. Um. So, firstly what I liked about it was that he actually uses the phrase ""gleaming mudcunt of Mother America"", which was kind of the literary equivalent to reading a bolt of lightning. That might be the most scandalous arrangement of five words that I've ever come across. Try to think of a more transgressive sentence! Arresting stuff.

Also, a lot of the novel is about the protagonist, David Bell, engaging in probably the most self-involved kind of art possible (personal blogging not having been a thing at the time DeLillo was writing this, ha). He goes back and explores and adjusts and sort of tries to fix his own anxieties accumulated through his entire life, working through the old grudges of childhood and the disfunction of failed relationships with this basically terrible sounding art film. As someone who periodically has the impulse to line up everyone I've ever met and apologize to them, before discarding the idea as basically unhealthy/unattractive, it's kind of amazing to read about a fictional character doing just that. Through his art film! His terrible terrible art film.

""We want to wallow in the terrible gleaming mudcunt of Mother America"" Amazing."

I haven't been doing it that long, but already have got to see some pretty cool stuff, I feel like I'll probably get a few good stories out of it. Between that, the university job I've had forever, and this other event planning job at the U of T that basically involves moving tables around, it's almost like holding a real job.

The downside is having to wear dress shoes practically constantly. Man! I know that basically every woman everywhere is going to have a tough time feeling too sorry for me on this one, but it is fairly unpleasant putting on a pair of shoes in the morning knowing that twelve hours later you are going to have like gaping wounds scraped up and down your feet. I sort of think of problematic footwear as being an essentially feminine issue, but turns out nope! Dudes haven't actually quite dodged that bullet to the extent that I sort of figured we had.

Some perks include referring to my feet as ""dogs"" while complaining (as in ""Man, my dogs ache"") Which is for some reason extremely funny to me, and that I've started wrapping my feet in gauze every morning, which is good mummy practice for later when I'm embalmed and want to rest eternally in comfort.

I don't think I've read any other memoirs, possibly at all, but I've just finished Sarah Manguso's <u>The Two Kinds of Decay</u>, and found it really gripping. Basically Sarah Manguso develops a debilitating auto-immune disease at twenty one, and it derails her life for the rest of the decade.

Some of the prose is really great. What I liked most, and I guess related to the most, was her initial sense of bafflement at how to deal with the hospital setting. As an example, for one procedure, ""My hematologist asked me if I wanted my parents there while it [a central line to deliver blood straight into her chest rather than using her arms] was implanted, and though I'd never have thought of bothering them in the middle of the night, I thought he was telling me that getting a central line was something that one's parents were supposed to be there for, so I said <i>sure</i>."" Which, there's a ton of scenes like that, imperfect communication or understanding, and just this ongoing lack of clarity about what Sarah Manguso should be doing, and how she should be going about it.



Something that kind of surprised me about this memoir is that we don't actually get a huge sense of Sarah Manguso's character as a person. We are given some insights, but the prose is dedicated mostly to explanations and descriptions of her illness, and to a kind of hospital lifestyle. In a work of fiction, most authors would probably use the illness/hospital setting to generate a believable character, and I guess one advantage of a memoir is that your character is understood to exist - you can actually withhold a lot of information that would probably be requisite in a comparable work of fiction.

I like goodreads a lot (http://www.goodreads.com/JamestownMarshland), as far as social media goes. After finishing a book, especially a good one, I tend to have a really strong desire to talk about that book, which unfortunately tends to be kind of boring for other people, unless they have also read that book somewhat recently. Even just the checklist format, ticking off that I've finished something feels gratifying, and works as a makeshift post-book reward. I've actually been talking about <u>The Two Kinds of Decay</u> a fair bit, even though I don't actually know anyone else who's read it, and it seems to make for less boring conversational material than recapping fiction generally does.

Maybe because illnesses are interesting? Or things that have actually happened are automatically more interesting that things that haven't?

Also I've kept on reading <u>Game of Thrones</u> like crazy. <u>A Feast for Crows</u> was actually kind of boring/frustrating/unsatisfying. Mostly we watch a bunch of previously minor characters wander around totally unrelated parts of the world, make wrong decisions, and be generally adrift. Which, I'm hooked enough that I'm probably going to plow right into the next (and currently the most recently published) book in the series. Which, man, I still have mixed feelings about reading so much high fantasy. I feel like since I'm out of school I should be doing valuable stuff with my free time.

"event","Just completed Mahmoud Dowlatabadi's <a href=""http://mhpbooks.com/books/missing-soluch/"">Missing Soluch</a>. I wish I could find the review that first made me interested in it; it was a really engaging outline of the author's life, especially the period in which he was writing/first publishing <u>Missing Soluch</u>. No dice, though.

<img src=""http://mhpbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Missing-Soluch-320x395.jpg"" />

The big thing, is it's great, just a really awesome read. It is, though, possibly one of the most unrelentingly heartbreaking pieces of fiction I've ever read in my life. Soluch, the patriarch of an impoverished Iranian family leaves within the first few pages of this 500 page tome, and the rest of the book is pretty much devoted to the extent to which, without an adult male protector, his family, consisting of his wife Mergan, sons Abbas and Abrau, and daughter Hajer, will never be able to get ahead, or even be happy, ever.

The review that convinced me to read this book described it as kind of an Iranian <u>Grapes of Wrath</u> and that is certainly there, but I can't help but also see a little bit of Jane Austen too. Like <u>Grapes of Wrath</u> this is a novel about extreme, obliterating poverty, and about the way that institutional cruelty can harden people, but in the unflinching assessments of the way that economics and gender shape social politics, I actually found a lot reminiscent about the way Austen describes the relationships between English nobility. Possibly this is a side effect of both social systems being described being extremely stratified, and how large a part marriage and inheritance play in determining social status in both time periods/places.

The novel is only rarely optimistic, but we do see a lot of strength in the characters, especially in Soluch's wife, who is left to raise and support her family as best she can, doing assorted odd jobs throughout the village of Zaminej in which they live. This is one of my favorite passages in the book, and the one I thought about the most over the course of reading it,

""Mergan's passion in her work was not a sign of her wish to please her employer, but came from her desire to master the task at hand. Mergan had come to learn that if she approached her work without passion or determination, she would be overwhelmed and defeated by it. So she tackled each task with an open heart. The nature of any work is that it can break you down, eventually destroy you. But it's you who must resist, hold your own ground. And Mergan would not accept seeing herself as in servitude, or as abject before her work. She tackled and uprooted each task before her.""

Dowlatabadi makes frequent use of clear, repetitive statements to illuminate simple truths. Repetition can be a bit tricky as a writer's tool, and generally I find it kind of off-putting in fiction, but rather than being tedious, I generally found the language lyrical and immersive. As an example, he describes an argument between two brothers, Abbas and Abrau, describing Abbas' interior state,

""Despite the fact that he didn't give much weight to Abrau's arguments, they did nonetheless prick at his heart. They didn't affect the roots of his convictions, but they shook their branches and leaves. They made him feel ambivalent and frustrated. They didn't change his path, but they bothered him all the same. So he didn't want to hear any more. He changed the topic.""

The content is repetitive, but the language is different enough each time that it feels more like a paring away of possible confusion, leaving us at the end with as clear as possible a description of, in this case, what it feels like to have an argument when your mind is already made up. The simplicity of the language, and the clarity of thought is a joy to read, and Dowlatabadi frequently provides adept and clear descriptions for extremely complicated psychological states.

The timeline for this novel is kind of nutty to me as well. I guess this is probably generally how translation works, but <u>Missing Soluch</u> was first published in Iran in 1979. It's Dowlatabadi's first novel translated into English, and it only just came out in English in 2007. That's almost thirty years later. Literature, I think, tends to be a slower moving medium than most, just because of its nature, but even if you look at a book published now versus one thirty years ago, there's (I think) a pretty big difference. If you (like myself) are inclined to think about literature as providing pretty large insight into a culture, it's kind of amazing to think that that method of understanding Iran is subject to something like a thirty year delay. He's about to have another novel translated and published in English, so maybe once the process of deciding to translate a given author is started, it moves a little faster, but it's still kind of a funny thing to think about."

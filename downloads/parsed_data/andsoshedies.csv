kurt, i love you. with all my heart and soul. and eventhough i said i wasn't going to fight anymore, i'm still fighting. you taught me that...i'm not talking but i'm fighting. i know you're not. so i will fight for us both."

i have to give up. i don't want to lose you but i have to. if what i'm feeling now hurts me this much,i wonder how hell would feel like...i'm sorry for being selfish for wanting you to be with me. i'm sorry for shedding every tear for you. i'm sorry for loving you with every ounce of love i can give. i'm sorry. i'm feeling the seperation. we've fought a good fight and i don't think i can keep fighting. i'm slowly dying. i am. i feel it in my shattered heart. i can't give you any more reasons why you should be with me and it hurts me more to know you can't seem to find any. i am ugly inside and out. i should thank you for showing me that. i want to recover quickly but i don't think i can mend my broken heart this time. i'm bound to be with someone like you, i know it. i keep wishing you'd see that for me too. i've pleaded for your love. i've pleaded too much. i should just stop and let you be. i'm sorry.

"event","so i'm off to the states in about 3 hours. i wish i was excited...but my dearest mother who goes crazy everytime we go on a trip, is ruining everything! gosh...by the time we get back everyone will hate eachother. oh how i can't wait. kurt will be watching over conando and our place. i hope he doesn't kill the thing. heh. 
i wondered today why i'm so caught up on him. i found answers. yet they don't mean anything since his heart is on someone else's hands. shutting off is actually helping me. i thought it wouldn't work and it would bottle up all my feelings but it's not. maybe i'm better of this way. just play along with everything he does eventhough it tears me apart inside. i feel my heart tear into pieces eveyday. yesterday was probably the worst. i don't think i can tape it back together. there's nothing more painful than having someone you loved for so long tell you there's no possiblity to become one.  he said he had lost interest. ouch. the feeling was having my heart shred into pieces then having the one that i love stab the pieces over and over again while looking straight at me mischievously. i will accept the fact that we may never be. but i can still love. i will give him my love. and it is the love that will last an enertiny and beyond. like i said, i will sacrifice anything for his happiness. even when i'm dragging a boulder tied around my neck. i will be on the side. but it's better than being behind... i will cry and i probably may just stare at nothing for an entire day, but he is my best friend...his happiness means everything."

horrible lost you'll find. soon enough, one of these days, silence you'll hear. all the days of countless nights, all the tears shed, will seize with just one click. the white crystal clear floor will soon be disturbed with the ragged red. flowing to every corner...out goes the life of one soldier. feel the rush of guilt. feel the pain. feel the loss. soon enough, one of these days, i'll no longer be in anyone's way.  the battle's done. soon.

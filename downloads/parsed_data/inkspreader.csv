you got to see my backpack ..so envy away !!  hahahaha 
bat day was cool  they said there was over 1000 goths and rockabillies there in disneyland . but i would say more like 300 .. or so give or take  more ghouls than guys .. some pretty cool clothes .. you know you all should share where you shop .. for all the  ones who envy you .
there was a wedding in front of the haunted mansion.
it was cool lots of yelling and cheering .. but the  but the guy that was performing the ceremony  was swearing  a little too much i think   i mean there is a lot of little kids there
it was cool to see all the goths of all ages   some were even in their sixties .. and there was whole families of goths .. even little baby goths ..
all in all it was a good time .. a little to hot to wear all black but i managed ..  i would post some pics of it but none of the night time pics turned out to well.. apparently there is another gathering .. for halloween aprox two weeks before halloween .. disneyland and knotts berry farm  decorate the whole place out pretty good i hear .. except they change the name to knotts scary farm ..its only a few miles down the road from disneyland . well thats it for now .. ps nicoles short ..hahahaha"

wolf is making me update his journal. so yeah.

he said i should write about how he was in disneyland and um...""bat days""? okay. i'm really confused right now. all he said was that it was a goth festival. apparently all the guys worked in leather work and the girls worked in fetish stores. 

my addition is that he got a really cool nightmare before christmas backpack that i have yet to see. and a sweatshirt. yes.

"event","what ever happened to keeping our history alive .. what really pisses me off is that all the cities and towns are removing all the standing headstones and tombs or crypts, in graveyards and are replacing them with those discrete headstones or plaques that lay flat on the ground and cant be seen  .. they think it looks better!  i think it sucks! .. it sucks bad!!  it takes away from the historical look of some old graveyards, and come all hallows eve it takes away from the way graveyards are supposed to look and have always looked... and have been seen in movies and described in stories .. soon thats all there will be left .. is what they look like in movies .. or some fictitious book .. i am very passionate about this .. i dont know i guess i am strange  but i have always loved graveyards .. ya they are spooky and creepy and  stuff but in a good way! i think they are very beautiful and mysterious .. i hated it enough to find out most cities only let the dead use the ground for 99 years then they dig them up and re-sell the plot .. unless the family re-buys the plot to keep the  person there..  but that usualy doesnt happen because most places cant or wont locate the families  to tell them ..so you cant go into a graveyard and read some names from 1800's .. and that sucks to .. you have to go to really old small towns to do that .. and they are disappearing also.. there tearing down all our old heritage homes .. or remodeling them to make them look new .. grrrrr  they all want new and bright and cheery .. all sunshine and lollipops .. yuck!!!  well we all dont like that !!!!.. dont get me wrong i am not even goth!!  and i am not depressed or dark .. i just like the night or cloudy  fogy days or a good thunder and lightning storm .. with lots of wind ..it relaxes me and makes me feel refreshed and full of energy ..i love the fall the best and the spring isnt to bad .. in b.c that is  i cant stand all that chirpy sunshine its to bright ..went outside today and almost got blinded .. it took fifteen minutes for my eyes to adjust to the light  i seriously couldnt see a thing  and my eyes were all watering ..i say leave our graveyards alone ..  our kids wont even know what a graveyard looks like if they keep wrecking them .. they will ask us why they look so funny in the halloween pics .. we will tell them  thats how they looked when we were young and they wont believe us ..."

"event","well  the shop is comming along pretty good so far  thanks for all the help to those that helped .. and thanks to amanda for helping with the paint  and to busty_midget for her labour .. and other help .. 
well i am way over budget as of the first doller i spent  hahaha the paint ended up being to pink .. .. and the trim didnt work even after five coats  .. because we neeeded a grey undercoat to it first .. so yup  had to change that .. i have lots of left over paint hahaha i was going to paint the floor grey and then clear coat instead of re- tile but .. i was informed  after buying the paint that it wouldn't hold .. even though the guy at general paint said it would .. so i did a couple of test squares and yup  it didnt hold  it chipped realy easy .. funny though i thought for sure it would work .. after all it is a floor paint .. but meh!!so i bought some floor stripper  and sometime this week i will find someone who knows how to strip floors  .. then i will clearcoat it .. that will work .. so i had to cover the trim wich ended up looking like burgandy  .. with the magenta that looked more bright pink then magenta  cause the shop was looking like valentines day threw up in there hahaha  .. so i bought some stuff that helps you work with the paint longer before it dry's and then i took the ceiling paint wich was a light grey  and mixed it 75-40 and started to roll it on with a roller and then dab the fresh paint with  paper .. and it looks great .. tommorow i will probably be finished with painting that, hopefully!....... the stuff comes in a realy small can, and its like twenty bucks even with amanda's discount .. i would have been tottaly screwed if she didnt help me with her discounts .. but anyways ..i am doing the whole shop like that and then keeping the tattoo rooms and the piercing room magenta .. its funny but only those rooms turned into a real magenta colour .. maybe its the lights  .. hmm maybe!!  .. i asked busty_midget if she could maybe do a mural .. but i am not sure i want one done .. maybe just the shop name painted .. but now i am thinking not just painted but airbrushed .. that may look even better ...what do you guys think?
i need a good used clean coach for the waiting erea . and maybe another chair .. and two or three barber chairs or preferably dental chairs  so if anyone has any leads let me know o.k maybe a couple of weeks and we will be open and running  .. cant wait .. thanks for everyones help so far ..

"event","well heres the question...
i am going to poll this question    please everyone who reads this please respond to it   .. i hope others will post polls on this question also  as we  all have different lj freinds  and the post answers will be greater ..(valentines day)  this holliday was created by hallmark greeting cards if i am not mistaken ..  in the sixties .. maybe earlier .. i think in my opinion it takes away from the true meaning of a relationship  .. by asking us to place a day to celebrate  and show affection to our freinds and mates  ... and if we do not  ,, then its frowned upon .. in my opinion it creates stress  .. and adds commerce to local industry only  .. yes it is good for business .. but cheapons the meaning  ... we have enough  commercial hollidays..............   celebrating love  or appreciating a freind ship  such as gift giving should be done spontaneously.. to keep it special  .. in the cases of new love or relationship love ...... it would be celebrated  by a anniversary ..
so do we need to have a day to make gretting cards chocolate and florists richer?  ... and to remind those who dont have anyone .. or have lost loves or recently lost a love, or lost  freindship  feel lonelier or worse  ... i think not !!  this is only my opinion ...  lets hear from you  what do you think 
i have a lot of freinds and people who care for me dearly  and for that i am very thankfull....... but i cant help but feel badly for those who dont feel loved  ... remember  even if you feel lonely  there is someone always thinking  happy thoughts about you ...or maybe even wishing they could call you... or even just get to say hi to you .... maybe they see you on the bus .... and are afraid to say hi  .. maybe it was someone from elementary school wanting to find you to see how you are now  .. a high school crush that never was mentioned ... the point is no matter how bad you feel or how lonely you are remember there is always someone wanting to talk to you or say hi .. so the next time someone walks by even if there not looking at you  say hi and wish them well  small things like that can brighten a day  or even .. beleive it or not  save a life .."

"event","ok here goes .. my spelling sucks realy bad .. so i apoligize in advance .. not to mention my punctuation .. lol

i am about to  say stuff i dont usualy tell people  .. why you ask ,, well let me tell you 
i have had some strange stuff happen to me thru my life ..  and this doesnt help ..
and i need to know if anyone else out there  can do the same thing .. or am i just a nut case ..
you will all think so after i say this .. but hey its about time i  talked about it and i am going to add a small storie of another strange thing that happened to me at the end of this .. so get ready to get out the straight jacket ..haha
well  sometimes  and i can never tell when !! i find myself  feeling things .. for example  .. when one of my clients is thinking of something,  its like i can feel what they are thinking/feeling... or if they are feeling dizzy so do i.. or sick  .. or  confused .. etc etc .. this has happened to me so many times i cant even count  .. sometimes when i am consetrating on my work and they are quiet i will come out and say something .. an answer to a question that they didnt even ask .. this has happened to lots of people  and some that people on here know, .. it happened once when i was tattooing cam .. i was doing his arm and he thought to himself where is laura ?
and i looked up and out loud said i dont know where she went  .. maybe she went into the bathroom .. well that kinda freaked him out .. he was like  hey buddy i didnt even say anything  but thats what i was thinking .. 
now dont get me wrong i didnt hear him say that i felt like i wanted to know where she was  .. in my own thoughts .. but i knew it wasnt mine it was his .. .. are you confused yet ?
this has happened all my life.. i was talking to a girl from, alberta .. and she had me on the webcam 
we talked about her freinds  and stuff  a little here and a little there .. then one night after a chat with her ; i left to go to the gym downtown .. as i was driving  i seen her in my mind .. stting at the computer  from my end  .. like i had seen her earlier .. then i seen a lady standing behind her .. she was completely in white .. but she was realy old and somehow i knew she was dead . and i knew her name .. i then had a huge flash of memory that only took a second and i knew everything that this girl had done for the last two weeks ..
so when i got home later on that night  i seen she was online .. well now here was a problem  .. do i tell her what i seen and we both laugh and she thinks i'm nuts  or does she just freak out .. maybe i should just not say anything 

well i decide to tell her everything i seen except .. that i knew the lady's name and that i knew  what she had done
so she seemed  calm enough and said thats funny  are you trying to scare me  .. by saying a dead woman is standing behind me .. so i was like no! .. this is her name .. its ieleen ... she said well my grandmothers name is ieleen .. i said is she dead .. she said no she is alive .. she said she lives in calgary ..   i am in reddear so its not that far .. i said no this grandmother  lives in ontario near a lake .. her name is ieleen   she was silent and said .. umm my dads mom is from ontario  and she lived near a lake  but i havnt seen her since  i was 5 years old ..
and she died a year ago ..... i said well i didnt see her standing behind you  when i was talking to you but as i was driving down robson street thinking about our conversation ,, i remebered seeing you on the web cam  and then i seen her ..
i said i knew everything she did for the last two weeks 
i said  lots of things about her  and she was amazed  .. but one thing confused me .. and she was anxious to find out what it was .. i said  your kitchen ,  is your kitchen yellow?
she was like yes . and i said if you stand in front of the counters  you can see the brown fridge to the right .. beside the back door   ... and she said ya .. and you have a glass screen door .. and a kitchen table   .  on the other side of the fridge .. she was like wow ya !!!.. and there is a small window above the sink with  white lace curtains .. and an off white counter with yelow stains ..  and she was like ya 
wow you just described my whole kitchen .. ok your freaking me out .. why are you telling me this .. i was like ok  this is what i seen and it confuses me!!  because its me seeing this but being something else who see's this and seeing it thru something else .. like i am viewing it thru the set of three diferent eyes using one set of eyes . you were standing at the counter last week and you were chopping something  and a cat rubbed against your legs and you cut yourself realy deep .. but didnt say anything to anyone and have been hiding it .. she couldnt respond .. i was like hello .. helloo  about three minutes went by .. and she said who are you .. where are you ?
i never told anyone about that .. i said your grandmother told me .. she sent the cat .. .. but it gets confusing because .. the cat didnt realy rub your legs did it!!  thats the part that bothers me,,, i cant figure it out! i am right but i am wrong .. she said  o.m.g  ... i was standing at the counter in the exact place you said .. and i was realy depressed and i was cutting my wrist ,, and my cat jumped up on the counter and started howling at me  like she was in pain.... so i started to cry  and stoped .. she has never been on the counters before  ........ i described her cat .. but i thought the cat was grey .. she says the cat is orange .. but when she showed me the cat on the webcam it looked grey  and had all the markings that i described it had .. we only talked a few  times after that .. it seemed like we didnt need to talk anymore .. she tried to keep talking to me  but it was like i shouldnt talk to her ......

something simular happened to me .. and laura .. not long after we met   and i have done this to her on several ocasions .. telling her about her family ... there ailments  and her relationships with each of them ..  describing her uncles and aunts  and grandmother .. and her ailments  troubles  and there good qualities.. i have always been dead on... i even told her about mike .. her ex.. boy friend .. what his house looked like inside and out .. what his family looked like how many pets .. described his part of the house .. described pictures on the walls .. where his family hangs .. what they talk about there habits .. his past relationships ..and that he cheated on her and described the girl he cheated on her with ..  you name it .. it was like i could feel what her memories were ..   you can all ask her if you want its all true .. i was dead on ... everything .. .. so i am only going to tell you guys about these couple of things  ..  man i could go on forever with stories .. about this kind of stuff  and what has happened .... it always feels while i am doing this  and after i do it .. that i have faked the whole thing ..  but i always get everything right !!  well almost everytime  but somepeople  wont admit to you when you are right ,, because you are exposing stuff that they find embarising or threatening ..  to sometimes find out you were right after all cause someone close to thenm said ya you were right  i dont know why they said you werent right .....so tell me  is there anyone who can do this???? ,, and do you feel like you are faking it also ??.. .. you can all delete me now if you want .. i wont blame you ..  but i had to get this off my chest and find out if i am alone ...... so if you all havnt laughed to hard  or deleted me .. then i will cary on with a storie that happened to me when i was 6 or 7......


so now my strange thing that happened to me ..
ok i was around six or seven and it was spring .. i believe  cause it wasnt to cold outside .. and i was living on the other side of richmond ..  directly across the street from the airport ..
i am the youngest of seven .. and everyone was out of the house  but myself and my mom.. and i was driving her crazy ..  telling her a was bored bored bored ..... it was around noon  .. and she was busy doing housework ..
she finaly got mad at me and told me to go outside and play .... we lived in a duplex  and had a   horseshoe   shaped drive way .. well i walked thru the living room and went out the front door .. the wood door was open and we had a glass door that had a lift up window  for ventilation ..   so i could see straight outside .. the living room window curtains were open and the room was fully iluminated with the sun .. 
so i walk outside  and walk down the three concrete stairs and accross the horseshoe shaped driveway . onto a patch of front lawn ..  near the ditch   at the edge of the lawn there was a dirt patch .. where we would play with our toys .... so i start  playing with my cars  and decide i would go inside and get my big truck   .. so i stand up , and walk across the lawn  and across the driveway and then walk up the three concrete steps  and reach for the front glass/screen door..  like i said before   you could see thru the door as it was glass and the living room window curtaines  were open so you could see in the living room perfectly and ther was no one inside the living room and i could see my mother in the the kitchen off to the left .. so i reach for the door  and start  to walk thru  .. once i get thru the door  i notice ,, that the living room is full of people  and the lights are all on ...   my brother then yells to my mom  here he is mom... well she comes running into the living room and shakes me and says where have you been?
we have been looking everywhere for you ... all these people and theres more out looking for you right now  .. i was completely confused .. where did all these people come from .. i just looked into the house thru the screen door a second ago and the house was empty...  and now its full of people .. ..well i tried to explain  the best i could that i  just went outside to play,, and that i was only gone for a second .. and that i came back in to get a truck .. but of course none of that actualy came out of my mouth  .. being seven  i was just ignored ,, my mother  was now trying to scold me  but also be polite and entertain the people who had  come to help search for me ... so anyways  still being confused about this i look over to the people sitting on the couch  and look straight out the window .. to see a most frightening thing .. especialy at seven years old!!! ... it was almost dark outside!!!  i turned quickly  and looked out the screen door  and then opened it and yes it was true it was almost dark .. the time was now around or after 8pm .. when i went outside it was noon and i was only out for a minute or two.. before walking back into the house .. somehow some where  eight hours of my life went missing from the time i tried to open the front screen door untill the time i walked thru ... to me it was instatanious .. for the people around me hours had passed without a trace of me to be found .... 
well thats one of the strange things that hapened to me ..  maybe if there is anyone left reading this .. i will tell you about another strange thing some time ..."

i am getting like 30 messages a day of that site  .. wednesday says that thats not normal .. but hey i have a web link to my site on there so maybe thats why  .. i know a lot of peple are asking for prices ..
which is a good thing ..so i pierced wednesdays lip   the other day and her dad flipped out she told her mom that i didnt do it but that someone downtown did it .. i think she bought it  cause she was like  what will wolf say when he see's it ?'
god i hope they dont find out about her septum then they will realy be pissed ..lol
oh well laura  no more for you for a while  .. alexis will kick both our asses if you get kicked out ..did i  mention that laura did my lip and my eyebrow well she did and they look fab!!!  lip is still a bit sore  but what a great job .. i did  a ear surgery on a girl the other day  .. she came in  for a hood piercing  .. and she mentioned that she had a gun piering in her ears about seven years ago and that the backing had completely healed into her ear ... the doctor wouldnt take it out  .. so they refered her  to a lumps and bumps specealist  and also a plastic surgeon  ..  so i told her i would do it  ... wednesday assisted..  and it worked out great !! the pics are on my website  in a new photo album  .. lots of new pics of wednesday on my site in case anyone is interested.. one from her school where her principal dressed up like her and laura dressed like the principal  for halloween .. its cute.. and some pics of her playing with my cat

and now i guess i have to get used to the site and finding out what to do ..  
and everyone reading this will have to get used to my bad spelling  ..hahaha
so anyways  laura pierced my lip and eyebrow  tonight woohoo .nice job girl  she put a labrette stud  just below my lip  and put a blue jewel on it ..looks nice  .  and let me tell you.!!!   that is one of the hardest piercings to do and get it straight ..and she nailed it first try .. she is amazing ..
everyone thinks its not that hard to do  but let me tell you .. by me saying straight i don't mean its centered  .. a lip / or munroe /   labrette  piercing if placed wrong  will point down or to one side or up ..  so to get it straight and point correctly is a challenge even for the most experienced piercer....THE INSIDE OF THE LIP IS THICKER AND TO JUST FOLLOW THE CLAMP  WOULD GIVE YOU A OFFSET PIERCING! she placed a horizontal eyebrow   over my right eye  and it looks great to .. virtually painless on both piercings .. you have a bright futer ahead of you girl!!!"

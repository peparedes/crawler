My birthday is coming up on Monday. I can finally buy cigarettes legally in the great state of NJ.

It's depressing when I think about all that's happened since January. This year has really sucked, and it doesn't look like it'll be ending on good terms, either. The boy that I love now belongs to another girl. My heart's still stolen and my mind's a mess. I know I love him and I know that I mess up, but I feel like even if I was perfect, it wouldn't be good enough for him. It wouldn't suit him...I wouldn't suit him anymore. We used to feel like a jigsaw puzzle that's just been completed. When he held me, we fit together perfectly. He was all of my missing pieces, and I was his missing pieces. Now we're both distant and just all wrong. I feel kind of childish to think that soulmates and the like do exist.

The only song that makes me cry no matter what is one of AJ's songs: ""A Mirror Image"". 


Everyday I wish upon a star.
The only thing is that I'm in broad day light.
I try to look around and see the world turn.
I try to twist but my knee's don't move.
In time this will only prove that you
come to me but I won't be there.

What I see in me, is what you don't believe
I don't want to go.

Sitting at the foot of my bed I can only think.
It's not coming up, but my wrists are talking.
In time this will only prove that you come to me but
I won't be there.

What I see in me, is what you don't believe.
I don't want to go.
What I see in you is what I hate the most.
I just love it way too much.

I don't want to go.
What I see in me, is what you don't believe.
I don't want to go."

"event","College is okay. I have so much work to do and I'm too unmotivated to do any of it ughhh. I realized that a majority of the people at MU are complete retards/morons/idiots/etc. I love my Communications class to death, though. Not that much work and it's something I really want to do. I decided I'm going to have a double major: Communications and Music Industry. I'm setting up a meeting this week to talk to the head of Music School here, and hopefully he'll help me get into some classes for next semester. Sarah moved out yesterday. She completely dropped out of college. I'll miss her, I guess.

Work is like hell. I hate working at Applebee's. Everyone who works there is about 30 years old and have dedicated their lives to this coporate food chain. I'm thinking about quitting and getting a job at either Blockbuster or Forever 21 or some other store in the mall. Hot Topic is easy. I don't like dealing with mallrats, though. Tonight is my first Saturday shift and I most definately don't want to work. Oh well. And we have to dress up for Halloween starting Sunday. Awesome...

I miss people. Talk to me!!!"

It feels like I've put in so much effort with Joey just to see it come crashing down, but I can thank myself for that one. I hate the situation we're in. I feel so scummy and worthless all the time. Sometimes I feel like the girl on the side, but, once again, I can thank myself for that one. Actually bump that I feel like the girl on the side all of the time. I feel insignificant and dispensible all of the time. I can't take it anymore. 90% of the time I feel like I'm the only one who's trying or who actually wants this.

Summer's quickly coming to an end and I hate it. I hate working two jobs and I don't want to go to college anymore. I don't really care. I want everything to just go back to normal. I want Joey to forget about Jill and I want us to be committed again, but I know what's going to happen and there's nothing I can to stop it. I'm powerless.

Family party. Picked up Chris, ate lots of food. Played with Michele's new dog, McFee, and then Cheech.
Drove back to Freehold (Gabby's, more precisely) looked at the flying squirell and sugar glider. Sweet.
Ate at BK then went back to Chris's and laid around all lazy and talked until I had to go home.

Tomorrow Cristina leaves for two weeks (Costa Rica) and I'll probably be in Freehold to see mah baby.

Being fatties in the food court like always then Sam left with the other Chris (T) and we dropped the car off at Chris's and just chilled while his mom and sister went to a friends house.
Chris dropped me off at home and we played with Cheech for a while. I love Cheech.

Senior Needle called to complain about me for an hour.
And Mr. Cancro called to inform my parents I'm not graudating. With no fucking reason or anything. Anybody with an actual brain would TELL THE STUDENT FIRST. Fucking jerkoff.
So now I'm grounded until next Thursday. That includes this whole fucking weekend.

I'm worried about Vic, too. I hope he's okay tonight.

Thursday = Chris then Brian and Devbro then Chris again.
Friday = dinner with Chris's dad and sister, then whatever. Maybe staying over his house?

Saturday = Chris/Englishtown Auction. Ughhh I have to wake up at 5:30am, shower and get ready, leave by 6:30 so I can get to Chris's by 7 so we can leave for the auction so he can help the Ritzer's with their pet shop thing until 3. Exhausting? Yeah. Considering I'm working til midnight, atleast, the previous night. Gross.

Atleast I get to sleep in tomorrow. Then Thursday is either Michele or Chris...perhaps both? Since our Friday plans got murdered.

So I told her I don't want to know her anymore and went along my merry way :]
Then Chris blah blah blah but now it's all good<3

Friday I hung out with Chris, Sam, and Gabby. We drove around aimlessly, ate at a dinner, bought a sticky hand pen at a dollar store and that entertained us for a good hour. There was drama but we ignored it. The night was good, mostly. Saturday I got Chris from work after hanging out with Joey and Sam and Gabby. Then Chris told me him and Carole are no more and it just made my day 9844543 times better. We got Sam and Gabby and went up to Bayonne to see TJcakes and the was good, again. Today I worked 9 to 5. Bank hours. Shoot me. I'm sick and tired.

Friday night I went to Asunpink with Carmena, Joe, Rozzi, Meg, Jes, Sam, Gabby, Bob, Ron (the jolly green giant),  TJ, and Chu. Afterwards Carmena and I took a much needed trip down to Brick to pick up some things then went off to Chu's house and it was a grand party. Bigon and Nick Reed or whatev showed up later. I think I paid Bigon 5$ so he'd give Jes a cigarette lol. It was an insane night, I loved it. 

Yesterday I went prom dress shopping with my mom but came back emtpy handed (but I got a cute outfit at Hco). Then I got Carmena from work and we played in the rain then went to Sam and Gabby's and played with all these nifty animals including Poop the magnificent bunnybuns. Then I drove him to his dad's house, hung out for a few, then drove home in the pouring rain.

Other than this&that drama, my day was fine. I mean I couldn't completely enjoy myself because this was just sitting in my mind all day, but it was still a lovely day. It was so nice out. I just hung out with Jes, Ron, Carmena, and Joe and it was nice. Then we picked up Sam and Gabby and I love those two. Their so fun and nice. And I decided I'm GOING to get a bunny. Well, I'll get someone to catch it for me, anyway.

I love just sitting in my car, seat back, sun roof open, and just looking up at the stars and listening to chill music. The perfect ending tonight. That's all I need, really.

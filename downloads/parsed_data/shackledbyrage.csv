"event","<P><EM>One thing I've realized I hate is *Drum Roll* Family Circus. You know, the little comic strip that has Jeffy, Dotty, and some other kid thats name ends with a ""Y""&nbsp;and their mismatched adventures in the life of a child who is raised by a devote christian family. Ooooo, what mischief he'll get themselves into! </EM></P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.lambiek.net/artists/keane_bil/keane_bil_familycircus.jpg""></P>
<P><EM>WOW DOTTY!!! Looks like you are a talented little one huh! Ya see this is the kinda shit that pisses me off! this shit is so damn stupid. If my kid ever said that they would get a nice backhand for damn sure! Does Dotty realize no one really gives a shit that she can make scrambled eggs without looking at the ""Menu"", and what the hell is ""Mommy"" doing while all this is going on? Is she opening the liquor cabinet? And why the hell is she wearing sneakers while in a nightgown? Is that a spoon she's holding? Nevermind lets go to the next comic</EM></P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.zippythepinhead.com/media/Fami0711.jpg""></P>
<P><EM>TADPOLES!?!?! What the&nbsp;hell is Dotty's fucking problem? I mean come on, tadpoles? Why is there a gift shop just randomly there? Whats ""Mommy"" doing this time? Does this woman ever watch her kids? She sure as hell doesn't dress them. Pink and Black?&nbsp;Who the hell thinks thats a decent color scheme? Is anyone besides me worried about why the Native Americans put a cross fusion between Bozo the clown and the coneheads on top of their totempoles, I mean ""Tadpoles""? Is that a Quacker on the top of the other one?</EM></P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.whiterose.org/michael/blog/archives/FC.gif""></P>
<P><EM>Well it looks like Dotty doesn't like feminisim. Dotty are you trying to say a woman's place is in the kitchen? Also isn't this comic from 2000? 2002? Can you even find a big screen TV that is in black and white? Does Dotty have anyother cloths? Same old Pink and Black mismatched outfit.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Ok, this next one just threw me through a loop, what is going on?</EM></P>
<P><EM><IMG src=""http://www.scscompa.com/MainWebPage/PicsDec2001/Comics/FamilyCircusSept32001.jpg""></EM></P>
<P><EM>Is ""Daddy"" coming on to the kids? Whats happening here?</EM></P>
<P><EM>Well at least there is someone who hate Family Circus too</EM></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <EM>Under George Bush Fluffy died... Well not really, but George Bush sucks. Why did Kerry have to resign so late in the game!? Why couldn't he have resigned soon enough to let Mr. Ralph Nader lead America to a new era of prosperity? WHY!?!?! John Kerry you piss me off! But not as much as Georgy Boy here. George Bush is a flat out dumbass. Well the current song suits my mood. (Smashing Pumpkins - Bullet With Butterfly Wings), because no matter how much I want to change this country and no matter how much it pisses me off (Or how much RAGE I have), I'm just a kid (Rat) who can't do anything (In a Cage) yet.&nbsp; Another thing is ..... um ..... ya know what George Bush sucks, he's the dumbest president we've ever had and he's making America look like a joke! Any one who can't see that must be blind. George Bush, you can take your victory and shove it! I'm glad in 4 years we won't have Mr. Dipshit here any more.</EM></P>"

"event","<P><EM><FONT color=#3333ff>Well I know now what people mean when they say stop while you're ahead. I have been craving Heath ever since I got a small fun size bar for Halloween. Whats so fun about getting less candy? You can't do that with a liver transplant! Well Mr. Johnson, we couldn't get you a normal liver... so we gave you a fun sized one! Isn't that great! It's only about 1/3 the normal size so you'll prolly die, but isn't it cute! *shitty doctor smile*. Well lets get back to the subject at hand here. Heath is good. Addictive, just like crack. But too much of one thing can be bad. I had a flurry with Heath in it with Mary saturday. Oh man that was good! do you think I was satisfied? NO!&nbsp;So today I lounged about til about 4 andthen took a shower. Next I walked to K-Mart, and bought two Heath bites... they were 2 for $4. What if I had bought one and it had cost normal price, I'd be getting jipped! So I bought two. Not even half way home I was half way done with the first bag. Needless to&nbsp;say, I felt like I was gonna puke and shit out a nice big Heath bar of my own. Luckily I didn't. so now I've got some Heath I don't want to eat and a stomach ache that blows. One word to this: Heartburn, Indigestion, Nausea, Upset Stomach,&nbsp;DiahrheiaYAY Peptopismal!. Well maybe itwasn't one word, but it gets the point across. ...Shazam!</FONT></EM></P>"

Yeah I think thats the ticket there. Personally I am trying to get over the shit you did, and just let it by, but personally i think you're a bitch as well. Ya see my mood, I'm mimicing you! *Shitty Smile* Everytime&nbsp;you walk by&nbsp;me, I want to stick my foot out and&nbsp;watch &nbsp;you smash your face in on the cement. I tryed being nice to you, and you spit it in my face, so ya can go fuck your self and die. You are a bitch and you treat almost everyone around you like shit. Anyone who's ever cared or tryed to care has been caught in the fury of your neverending period. (Honestly, when I went out with you it seemed every week ya had one. Ya might wanna get that checked out.) Your parents, your friends, your current and ex boyfriends. All of them can't escape your bitchiness. I wouldn't have such a problem with you if for one, you didn't give me dirty looks whenever you walked by me. Two if you would just go to hell already. Well thats all for now. Oh, and Jessica if you are reading this, I'd like to say one thing: ""Have a nice day."" *Shitty Forced Smile*</FONT></EM></P>"

"event","<P><EM><FONT color=#000000>Ok I'm tired of fuck headed guys who make everyother guy on the earth look like an egotistical, self-absorbed, womanizing moron! Come on now, if your going to fuck a girl, get her pregnant, and split without paying $60 child support every month. Then why don't you take your cheap ass to the salvation army, buy a $3 pistol and blow your fucking brains out. At least then your parents can pay for the child support on your life insurance money which is for the better because you are more of a use to this world with your brains splattered on a sign that says ""Shirts $0.50 each"" anyways. Then we get to the guys who lie about there feelings ho,ho! don't even get me started on that one! I'll be here all fucking night. *moves on* Cheaters..., and I'm goin co-ed here, any one who cheats is a complete and total waste of life. And don't give me ""I couldn't help myself."", ""It happened so fast."", ""I was just horny."", ""It ment nothing to me."". Well ya know what Suzie? Your boyfriend is commiting suicide right now cause of it....Way...to...go...dipshit. People like this should literally stop breathing, and if you need help, I have some twist ties I can sting together and strangle the life out of you with. Any takers? And ya see guys were in a rut as it is. Media hates us. Have you seen the ""Rape is a Crime"" commercials? ""She kept telling me 'no', but I knew she wanted it."" WHAT THE FUCK KINDA SHITIS THAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? You stupid douche bag! Which bringsme up on ""Rape"" what kinda lonely freak has to force a person to have sex with them? Go ahead, get a prostitute. Like you have much farther to drop if your willing to beat the shit out of or drug someone to fuck them. Here's a novel idea ""MASTURBATE"". You got alot of that to look foward to if you get convicted. Lots and lots of lonely masturbation....oh wait you arn't alone. You'll have Big Timothy there to watch you and then show you how you rape a person. Oh, and don't expect the Feminist's help. Ohhhh Nooooo. Like Hitler without Midol there. Feminists I'd like to blame the problems of the world. No I'm not saying women shouldn't have rights. Men and women are created equally, and should be treated equally. But nooooooo Bitchy McBitchbitch says men are the problem with the world and are trying to libverate them selves from men. I say ship em off to a deserted island and tell em to fuck them selves. At least then were taking a skimmer to some of the filth in the gene pool. What are they gonna do? Go fuck them selves? Thats what all of them can do to! Is fuck them selves. I'm tired of hearing about womens rights and ""The Veiw"" is just a joke. What can women not comprehend regualr news that they have to have it broken into small little peices by Star Jones (Who needs to eat ""small peices"" might I add)? I don't think so. So ya know what feminists ""Stop before you lose your right of suffarage."". No I don't think women are stupid, nor I do smile up at my ancestors for their rights being revoked. But people like Cheating assholes, Moronic Womanizers, and Feminists piss me the fuck off! and should just beflused away. Like an nice enema enduced bowl movement that end with the gene pool being slighty more sanitairy.<BR><BR>If you are one of those peopleI spoke of, feel free to fuck off and die!</FONT></EM></P>"

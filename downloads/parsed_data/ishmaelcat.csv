"event","i think live journal hates me, i don't bame it but i won't let me do anything.  Today i swam, read my book, swam, went tubing with my cousins, and washed my hair pretty preductive day.  this is why i like summer. But i always need to be doing something so i am kind of glad when school starts.  i will have classes plus a job plus social stuff, and i doubt my problem will be not having enough to do.  that is if i even go to school, hello orientation the last day in august.  and yesterday anna told me i am in general college that scared the shit out of me, what if i have all these letters i never opened saying if you don't reply you will be put into general college.  i keep having these crazy dreams that lead me to believe i have a sub concious fear of abondement and rejection....blah blah blah owen has a really hot cousin."

"event","so i can't believe i actually have a live journal i am guessing i won't write in it often and when i do i don't think i am going to use puntuation...nope...oh waite excet for dot dot dot (...) because i couldn't live without it and it has so many uses and ' that whatever that is called i know what it is called i just can't remember eh whatever yeah thats how lazy i am i can't even remeber what punctuation is called right i knew i had a point in hear somewhere oh yeah i got inspired to write in my journal because i did some of my math..four problems...and this is the best part....i got the answers right...yeah so i was proud of myself...which is sort of pathetic and i am really working on doing my homework..baby steps..baby steps..ya know people who say i am strange should really spend time with my family they are insane... i can't even describe it my dad talks to himself but in the form of half a question..yeah doesn't make sense..nevermind i don't feel like describing it because it won't get funny that what its like in my head..k thats it"

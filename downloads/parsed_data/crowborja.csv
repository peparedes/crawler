It was a mixed blessing, in hindsight, when I met Mr. Carradine&nbsp; he was standoffish, surly, and appeared to be depressed.

the squeel of metal mental wheels screeching to turn 
the fantasies through the tracks in your head running amok
 I am the beat that goes on and on and on pounding endless
beats throughout your body playing your spirit like a drum while 
you are wondering where that thump came from
 I am that unselfish lover who in a unknown moment of poetry
stole the covers while I slept, but you let me have my ignorant victory
 I am the nostalgic reminiscing of your misspent youth when young bodies sweat 
against each other on hot dark nights on dance floors, in cars, in dark alleys, on sweat soaked sheets
while sober or in drug or alcoholic induced ecstasy
 I am responsible for the pain that you feel like a giant flash flood through a small creek
overflowing the sides making the ground sink in forcing the water ways to spread wider
then it's ever been and once  done leaves you empty and damaged but with greater capacity for more pain
 I am responsible for the joy you feel, that self indulgence of ecstatic escapism you keep running too
in the heat of passion between the seconds of love and lust as you thrust insinc with your lover 
while shouting your pleasure and defiance of death to the world
 I am the tiredness you feel when you no longer can hold on to that joy
the shame when you can no longer feel that passion for your lover
that sadness you feel when your lover no longer wants you
 I am how you feel old, tired and world weary, the weight of time a burden you share 
with your generation, the damning reality of mortality coiling around your body like a
vine of thorns squeezing slowly but surely.
 I am, as you should have known by now, your life and I am only this way
because it is the only way you have allowed me to be. You can't change the past, you can't defeat mortality,and
you can't undo regrets, but right now you can change who I am."

rain like unstoppable tears flow down crying roofs
wind blows with a silent chill against frozen windows
and water hits the ground becomes  crackling ice sheets
 while you sit and wait for sleep that fails to come

the day will be overcast 
the ice will still remain on the ground 
rain will still taunt you in the day light
and the sleep that you wait for will elude you
though your eyes will be red from insomnia

Heaven knows that your clock is ticking
trying to slow down for the next re setting
but your eyes are open and the rain keeps pouring
the roofs keep crying and the ice still crackles
the wind brings the whisper of sleep from afar
saying it'll come tommorow maybe but will be very late

competing with blood shot visions
fading and reappearing with each muffled heartbeat."

 I woke up in a dark room to the smell of someone who has been sick and unbathed for a long time. Since no one else was around that I could tell the smell must be coming from me. Now just waking up groggy and disoriented makes me forget how I got this way, oh wait now I remember I got bit by a zombie silly me. 
 
 Getting up from the bed I realized that the dark wasn't a problem for me, I knew where everything was situated in the room so I didn't hit anything on my way to the bathroom. I still had electricity because the light went on when I flipped the switch automatically going in to the bathroom. Now think of the worst hangover you have ever had, double that and it would only be the tenth of what I felt, as soon as the light was on I hit the floor in pure agony. 

 I felt like some one hit me in the head with a spikey jackhammer and left it there, it must have been about fifteen minutes or so before I could get used to the light burning through my eyelids to get off the floor and look in the mirror. What I saw looking back scared the shit out of me, I used to look like a slightly flabby guy with brown skin brown eyes and black hair. Now I look like an albino on the verge of anorexic episode, I'm so pale and skinny a vampire would not only be scared of me it would ask if I need something to eat or drink. 

 This new look of course will interesting when I go outside to find if there are any other survivers. First will they look like me or be normal looking, second will they accept me or try to kill me, and three am I sure I wont attack them. I not sure about the last one because right now I'm feeling hungry... really hungry."

My score on The Alignment Test:

**************************************
/*tnote[Bypass]*/
    True Neutral
    (50% Good, 54% Chaotic)

""Plane of Existence: The Outlands, ""Plane of Concordant Opposition"". Description: The plane between all other outer planes.


Examples of True Neutrals (Ethically Neutral, Morally Neutral)


Red XIII, ""Nanaki"" (FFVII)
Vincent Valentine (FFVII)
Cid Highwind (FFVII)
Mr. Spock
Linus Torvalds
Dr. Strangelove

Not actively for or against anything. Has his or her own reasons for doing everything. Usually difficult to understand.


Will keep their word if in their best interest
May attack an unarmed foe
May use poison
May help those in need
May work with others
Indifferent to higher authority
Indifferent to organizations

True Neutral ""Pure Neutral""
""Balancer""

Some neutral [people] commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They are of the true neutral alignment as described in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.

A true neutral [person] sees good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. He advocates the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.

Some true neutral [people] actively support balance in the world, and seek to avoid having any one side, law or chaos, good or evil, become too powerful over them or anyone else, and will work against whichever side is the most powerful. They tend to side with the underdog in any situation, and are often opportunistic in their actions.

True neutral is committed to the avoidance of extremes, and is non-judgemental.

Move now to rest the body of one so ingrained in the realm of your making, away from 
the created world of your mind's playground.&nbsp; The ethereal form of Fantasy fades quickly 
to leave you in tears that only feeds reality's ravenous never ending hunger.

&nbsp;The Shadow of Fantasy lingers for a little while hoping for your mind's 
grasp to save whats left of it's former self. Reality has a different agenda,
it's claws have ripped away most of Fantasy's visage away from your mind,
like a reaper ripping your soul from your body.

&nbsp;The time for Fantasy is at an end, Reality wrests&nbsp; Fantasy's mantle away from her 
and wears it like a second skin wrapped around her shoulders like a bloody cloak made
of your hopes and imagination. So farewell to Fantasy may the place she goes to be better
than the dead world that is your mind.

"event","Last saturday a coworker at my second job said a few things that have been on my mind now for the past couple of days. We were busy,  I was stocking his bar, and in the course of doing so we were talking and the word sandni**er popped out of his mouth. I was shocked that he would say something like that he has never said any racist comment before that and as soon as he said it a look of profound shame and sadness came over his face and eyes. Even though I'm not from the Middle East he still apologised to me for saying it, I think that it was more of a surprise to him that the word out of his mouth than it was for me.
 Now understand that this guy isn't a mean spirited racist ass, far from it. He is a hard working mostly happy guy, although he can be dorky half the time, he never did strike me as some one who would say something like this. After he apologised he told me he still has issues after coming back from Iraq, that was the first time I found out he was a vet. He is young only in his mid twenties I think and although what he said was reprehensible I think his guilt and sincere apology made it forgivable if not understandable. He has alot of anger and sadness from being over there, too many times politcal crap hinderd him from doing what he should have been able to do to keep people safe and not angry at him or his fellow soldiers. I saddend me to hear him say that his first confirmed kill was a Sunni kid who had a homemade bomb strapped to him, he said the kid looked to be around eight or nine. I could say more about what he said of his experience there but it would just depress me more, I just needed to write this down because it has been on my mind for the past couple of days."

Today was not a good day to skip work and sleep in, Jess wanted to go to work because she had to answer the phones but I decided to stay home so she went without me. That was a big mistake, because now I'm sitting here in the dark not able to go outside because there are fucking zombies roaming the streets in packs.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;My first clue to there being a problem was gunfire, I mean not just some wanna be gangsta getting high some mile down the road and shooting his little deuce-deuce in the air for kicks, no this was several types of guns being fired from every direction. Not only that but the sound of squealing tires, car crashes, and sirens where everywhere too. Then I see a car full of asian kids with guns shooting at some thing behind them, thats when I saw the pack of zombies. All I can say is thank the Goddess for Romero and&nbsp; his zombie films because without them I would not believe this was happening. I closed my downstairs door and barricaded it, went upstairs locked the upstairs door and got out my wifes gun, it was only a nine mil but it was all I had besides a baseball bat and an asortment&nbsp; of swords which if I had to use them it be over really quick because that would be too close to the zombies for me.<br /><br />&nbsp;The phone was still working so I called Jess on cell phone to see if she was alright, half expecting it not to ring I was almost surprised when it did and she answered. We work in Choctaw at her families business so she was a little bit away from from the city and suburbs but it was no picnic where she was at either.&nbsp; Her family and her are at her parents house gathering all their guns which thankfully they have quite a few of them. Right now I wish a had her brother's AK-47 or his shotgun, it would make me less likely to feel like pissing my pants right now. Her family&nbsp; have been watching the local and national news or whats left of them. They all give the same story, stay in your homes and barricade all windows and doors, and keep the lights off.&nbsp; Jess wanted to come get me, but I told her that it was too crazy and dangerous in the city to come back right now please stay where she is at. I had plenty of food and wasn't stepping outside for anything.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;While we were talking her phone went dead. I tried calling her back but no connection, I tried her parents phone and got a busy signal, I finally got her online on messenger it seems cell phones don't work now but land lines still do.&nbsp; She was on the laptop and was IMing our other friends those she could reach. We are talking right now in between listening to online radio news&nbsp; and checking windows and doors, local tv news is gone, but we are still getting some national news because of cable. Most of our info is coming to us from friends and other bloggers who have survived and are still blogging, a few even have recorded some footage of&nbsp; their area to show whats going on around them. It's not just our country that this is happening to, but all around the world I'm even getting some blogs from some of my friends in England.<br /><br />&nbsp;Jess is signing off for now she needs to get some rest before she has to be on watch at her families house,&nbsp; I'm tired too but I can't sleep it is raining now&nbsp; and I want to stay up to watch the storm . My cats are whining to go outside, there is no way I'm doing that, but I open the window&nbsp; a little so that they can get on the porch roof to get some fresh air. I can now hear the moans of the zombies and the occasional screams and gun shots from afar, looking down the street from my window I see a homeless man turned zombie shuffling around the street.&nbsp; I want too shoot it but it will draw attention to me in my second story view of this Zombie Apocolyps so I just sit here in the dark blogging and watching the end of the world as we know it. By the way David if you are still alive it's not Evil Robot&nbsp; Overlords who conquered us so you owe me ten bucks...but I would settle for&nbsp; a bigger gun and more ammo.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://myelvesaredifferent.blogspot.com/2007/05/blog-like-its-end-of-world-bliteotw.html"">And then I saw this article which explains it all.</a>"

"event","I had this dream about the CSI group from vegashad to help a California town that was close to Nevada solve a couple of murders. They were both at a nudeist resort/ living cumunity. Apparently one person was shot on her balcony assanation style and one guy was eletricuted on his bed which was rigged to a wall socket. While the group was investigating the murders a local prominant preacher who looks like Jerry Fallwell but with curly hair and side-burns starts preaching about the evils of the resort because most members are wiccan and generly making a nusance of himself to the local police and the CSI team.
  One of the csi members got arrested because an inept security gaurd thought he was tresspassing and looked suspicious. While sorting out the problem at the police station he sees the preacher talking to one of the investigating officers, it turns out that the officer was related to the preacher which made him seem to be comprimising the investigation and made the preacher a suspect. Anyways long story short the killers were a jealous girlefriend of the female victim's exhusband who is an expert marksmen and the male victim was an accident. There was an electrcian who left an old circut tester plugged in and when the victim jumped into bed he cut into the wires of the circut tester which connected with the bed's metal fame causing electricty to flow through and kill him. As for the Preacher he found himself waking up one afternoon at the resort's pool on a lounge chair naked, someone drugged him and placed him there without anyone the wiser.
  And that was my dream on sunday morning."

The idea of this excercise is to understand exactly how dynamic a person's sexual orientation can be, as well as how fluid it can be over a person's lifespan. While a person's number of actual homo/heterosexual encounters may be easy to categorize, their actual orientation may be completely different. Simple labels like ""homosexual"", ""heterosexual"", and ""bisexual"" need not be the only three options available to us.<br/><br/><a href='http://www.youthnetsouthampton.org.uk/breakout/kleingrid.php' target='_blank'>Take the quiz</a>"

"event","Two days ago I get a call from someone to come for a job interview he would not tell me what the job was or who recomended me, only that even if I wasn't qualified I would get training for the job. This sounded very suspecious to me considering that I haven't applied for another job nor know anyone who would recomend me for a job that would allow me to earn more than forty thousand a year. To get him off the phone I agreed to a scheduled interview thinking he wouldn't really expect me to come. Today he called to confirm the apointment, needless to say I was suprised and even more suspecious and canceled the interview stateing that I did not have time to work a second job so the interview was pointless. He then asked if he can call back another time when I had time again for an interview and I agreed for a recall  in three months time to get him off the phone again. The funny thing is his office is at the Bank of America building here in Okc, and I owe that particular bank money. What do guys think ,is this guy  a bill collector?"

Has pale comparisons to the man I should have been, been overrun by the realty that you know is me?
Make haste I do believe your illusion of my life is passing you by,
words seem to fail you, does my pain make you smile like your joy makes me cry?

 Take one step to the side and get out of my way
I see some faint shimmer of hope
swinging seductively at the end of a velvet rope.
Calling to the man I'll never be, I wrap the noose 
around his neck gently, softly, lovingly tight but never loose
till he fades away leaving with a sigh and a smile forever out of sight
while I still wait to be me."

Tied like a bow resting on my shelf as if to tell me what I used to be.
It has no voice but somehow it's telling me of the consequince of youthfull choice.
Lifetime of regrets seem to appear in my mind  like a tv screen of white noise.
Illusions of immortality wrestel with grim reality, a fight the latter always prevails,
truth held out I thought of certenty not doubt, but the lies whimper and fail.

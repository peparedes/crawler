I love you!!"

"event","Hole's Human Anatomy & Physiology is a nice book. One thousand and forty one pages that my eyes will never concentrate on. Here is also the latest cosmopolitan. Two hundred and seventy seven pages filled with the most famous sex tips and everything anyone would ever want to know about Jessica Simpson. 

I can't go back to sleep. I have been a morning person forever and if you wake me up early usually I'll stay woken. Although I didn't ..try to fall back I know it won't happen. 

You left me this morning too early. I sat up on the unfamiliar left side and set my alarm to notify me when ten o clock got here. I guess I got up and put clothes on. Then I collected all the things WE brought into her room. Stuffed some things in my bag, threw more away. A yoohoo bottle that is now a permanent image glued to my phone. A starbucks mocha drink that would improve one hundred percent if vanilla. A paper plate sprinkled with cheese cake crumbs that would feed an entire mouse army. This house used to house a mouse. Then it escaped and is now lying dead somewhere, probably in pieces inside something else. Mmm. Cheeeeesecake. 

I had ice cream and a tall bottle of sugar water for breakfast. I know you wish you stayed. 

I want to go home... 

I guess I'll go pull bags together and make sure everything is perfectly perfect...
...I just need to finish reading How to Turn Him On In 10 Words or Less."

"event","I wish something would happen. I plan on getting sucked up in this job with no time left. 
Keeping busy usually keeps me un-sad. It just depends. 

Everything is nice for now. I won't let it get routine. It's getting routine. 

I think some people should forget me. Or something."

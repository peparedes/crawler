"event","so its been ages since i last updated this thing, probably because the sole intention of erecting such a vile and quirky monument to my mind has gone, i.e. a girl who encouraged the setting up of a livejournal and i thought hey! i'll quirk my way into her pants using words.  soooooooooo no thats not true at all, well maybe just a little.....  but fuck it i thought i'd sign off on a sour note, seeing as the sugary sickly entries heretofore represent me none.

so fuck, i guess all the endeavours a male undertakes throughout his life in order to achieve success are spurred by the past, more specificaly to that most momentous rift in a young man's fabric; his first love.  the drives to earn the most money and fuck the most popular girl can all be stemmed back to an inherent need for revenge, or a vindication of something... that the bitch should never have broken your heart and you'll show her what she's missing, coz you're good godamnit and your love is not......  actually you're practically worthless, your need to grasp and live a hedonistic philosophy means u can't even stay faithful to your girlfriend, who you say u love more than anyone ever but you can easily fuck a stranger and meet the love of your life an hour later and not flinch. cozzzzzzzz ure evil probably, or maybe you want to make so many people happy that u engage in several quasi relationships to sate ur insatiable lust for love.  who can really tell??????????  all i know is that when i pluck my eyebrows tomorrow, ive got got sarah to thank :P"

"event","sometimes I despair; as inadequate as I am at communicating verbally, face to face, over the phone i'm reduced to a vacuous nonsense wizard, spell-binding only to silence-mongers whose mothers always taught them that saying interesting things was tantamount to teasing satan's testicles with your oh-so-clever tongue, while baby Jesus was being forced to watch through a crack in the wardrobe.  When most needed, words tend to desert me, which is why I invariably end up writing them down... and livejournal is hardly the place for some of my less PC ruminations. But alas... 


And kinda morbidly I thought, what if she crashed?! A plane crash!! The thought was carelessly tendered, not in that wholesome, humane sort of way, but in my patented selfish fuck style, preoccupied with how ridiculously alone i'd be in my grief.  And I think i've felt this before, this feeling, this role as the boy, the wafter-inner.  Nowhere near as legitimate as actual long-held friends, and yet as the boy i'm privy to certain undulations of emotion and thought that are reserved for the boy, who as the boy is bastion of romantic love, not the proper sort of love you find fluttering about between friends. 

So yes, upon hearing the tragic news, I would run out into the rain, arms out-stretched, fully expecting a consoling embrace from a loved one.  And it would never come, and i'd stare at the sky, that motherfuck, the same sky that so flippantly spat you out into the sea.... the sea; your entrance would be stunning.  The curtains would melt apart as you poured in, kissing the water, submerging yourself in the thunderous applause of the ocean.  Your roseate radiance would spore like pink blood... the reviews will be full of praise.  And I swim 10 years into the future, to a beach I never thought i'd get to, one of those Donegal postcard why-the-fuck-doesn't-everyone-just-wanna-live-here-and-have-an-orgy sorta beaches, and I dip my tiny daughter into the ocean, her first embrace, and I wonder if you're there, pink and coral, I know you're there.  And I ask you to kiss her eyes...


What I meant to say was, in other words, I'll miss you. x"

"event","The women of Ulster have a contest urinating on a phallic pile of snow; the one whose urine penetrates most deeply is deemed to have the greatest sexual potency.  The winner of the contest, Derbforgaill, arouses so much jealousy among the other women that they disfigure her, causing her eventually to die of shame...............
Now thats culture, none of your Bord Failte ballyhoo.  I'm able to appreciate a good bladder me, same way as I can appreciate a girl who drinks guinness. I suppose that makes me a pervert:) My own scatological sorceress, heroine of micturition, princess of, err, pee has left me for another week, and I miss her so I do.  So its to her that I devote this lusty rendition of a Yeatsy poem....

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Last Night I lay on the mountain
There in a two horsed carriage
That on two wheels ran
Great Bladdered Emer sat, 
Her violent man
Cuchulain, sat at her side,
Thereupon,
Propped upon my two knees,
I kissed a stone;
I lay stretched out in the dirt
And I cried tears down.

Walking home from the bus-stop it pissed rain and my melody pop broke, but I didn't mind really.  Nonsense is wonderful.  Happiness is a warm, midget-bitten bum."

"event","looking cock-eyed at the eurovision song contest, trying to teach my li'l sister the joys of leaving cert. poetry, biting my bottom lip, missing her, hamstering my nose in an attempt to dislodge the pollen lodged stubbornly thereup - these are the things occupying my time a ce moment.  I feel dizzy, nothing inside me is in any way touchable.  + all that political voting shite in the eurovision ""pong"" contest (you heard me) was stupid! + my little sisters having none of my pretense, she don't know what a ""prescribed"" poet is and she don't care, she smiled and her teeth reminded me that really we're not so different:)


Sigh... i'm such an idiot. Fractured, flawed, a broken boy, my masochistic muscle got a real workout last night.  Probably bound to happen, an open relationship is vulnerable at some stage to become human, and last night in a strange way has asked cold ambiguity to account for itself.  It can't, I think I like her too much.  ""She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.  I am important to her.  She comes and goes.  Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness"".  This broken boy's heart is fixed on the curve of your smile."

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>that was the last thing I remember saying in a dream I had last night, one of those dreams where you realise that you're actually dreaming, and promptly tell yourself to wake up.&nbsp; Just as well really, coz it was after 8 and I had an exam that morning, and my plan to rise at 4am went a bit tits up.&nbsp; I'd carefully rigged 3 alarm clocks at strategic points around my slobbering head so that i'd definately, DEFINATELY wake up at 4, i'd even&nbsp;asked 2 other soc+pol all-nighter heads to ring me early but nope, they left me blubbering nonsense in dreamsville.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From there I schlepped trained dragged transcined my load off to the Black Box where I manufactured 10 pages of nonsense, B- standard if i've learned anything from uni, and returned to my precious, precious bed.&nbsp; It's fast becoming my only safe retreat, my bed... outside it i'm vunerable to the 3 sources of modern power, all of which want&nbsp;to erode my lollipop life.&nbsp; Firstly, theres the state, with all its mean exams and inoculations and free dentistry.&nbsp; Then theres the market, which dresses me up like a big whore every day and tries to sell me to the highest bidder, who is invariably an overweight middle-aged man in a suit.&nbsp; And then theres women, horrible horrible women, whose sole&nbsp;collective aim&nbsp;is to render me insane and incontinent.&nbsp; I've tried loving them, hating them, even dabbling in various shades of indifference, but nothing works.&nbsp; And it all makes perfect sense, as&nbsp;people will always want what they can't have, so logically no two people can ever be content together.&nbsp; Either they want too much of ya, or too little, its a mindfuck all the same.&nbsp; I'll leave Joycey to sum&nbsp;me up.......</P>

"event","the slight pins and needles rain

that somehow solidifies the smell

that teasing smell,

the smell of Spring's conception.

fresh cut grass that spores and spores

its lavenlime loveliness

showering on me its giddy, quivering slick.

the virgin face of a flower

in first embrace with the night.

she curves to face the darkness,

to taste at last her first forbidden kiss."

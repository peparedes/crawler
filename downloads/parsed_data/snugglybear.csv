"event","It's the beginning of a new year, and I've been more than a bit pensive lately. I am constantly thinking about my future, and what the hell I'm going to do with my life once I graduate. I have no idea what I'll do, or where I will be.
I think about how scary it is to get out into the real world, without the cushion of parents to fall back on, or the guaranteed social life that college seems to give us. It is so easy to make friends when you go to classes every day with people your age, with the same major and therefore same basic interests as you. In the real world, it seems like it will be a lot harder to make friends.

A lot of my closest friends have graduated and moved on, and even though we keep in touch, we don't get to hang out like we used to. I miss them a lot, but more than that, I think I am afraid to expand my bubble. I liked my comfort bubble, I liked my group and things the way they were. Oh, growing up...

I worry that I won't find that special someone to share my life with; that one that is always there when I'm scared, or when I just need a hug, or to celebrate with when I get that great new job. The person who laughs with me, cries with me, the ONE. I know it seems ridiculous to worry about those kinds of things at the age of 22, but hell, half the kids in my graduating class are already married, and most of them have kids of their own now! I am not in any rush to be married, I just want to find my companion. Is that so bad?

When I realized that he wasn't the one, I had to end it. Of course I knew all along that he wasn't it, but I liked to entertain that romantic ideal that he would fall in love with me, and that everything else would just work itself out. He warned me from the beginning, and I didn't listen. I don't regret dating him, I feel that I learned so many things, and I have so many fun memories in the three short months that we were together. It's funny, it feels like a lot longer. Maybe it's because we spent all of our time together, or maybe it's just that as I get older, relationships just seem to become more intense. 

I just wish there was a quick fix to that lonely feeling you get when you break up with someone. I find that I don't know what to do with myself when I get home. It used to be that I would look forward to the end of the work day, because I knew I would see him, or I'd be rushing home to get ready to cook dinner, or go out, or go to a party, or go here or there, just somewhere with him. I had things to look forward to. Now I have an empty heart and an equally empty house greeting me at the door. 

I think one of the hardest parts of this break up in particular is the fact that I don't hate him, and I'm not really mad. We are just two people in different places. He is going into the military, life, where you move a lot, and things are pretty hectic. I want stability, and I crave routine. Don't get me wrong, I want adventure and excitement too, but I just want to know that I have roots. I also know that he wasn't done playing the field, and that's completely normal. It's just too bad because I am done. I've been to the puppet show, I've seen the strings. 

So what to do now? I think the most important thing is to stick to my decisions. Remember that I made a choice, and I know it was the right one. Sometimes things that hurt us now end up being the things that make us so much stronger in the long run. I just wish there was a way to turn my heart off for awhile. Not forever, just for a little while.

Man, the day tylenol comes out with a cure for the common break up, I will be buying shares."

"event","My stomach hates me. Well not so much my stomach as my malfunctioning gall bladder. The rat bastard. Now my doctor apparently hates me, as she has put me on a diet so strict I don't even think Jesus would follow it. No dairy, no oil and grease, no spicey food, no fat, NO FUN! And the worst? No alcohol, right after I move into the perfect party house. What is wrong with this world? I can see it now...woah...I am sooo sober right now dude, this is crazy. Gross.
My roommates have really helped me with the diet. Wait did I say help? I meant tormented. ""Oh Tess, this grilled cheese sandwhich is soo good. I'm all thirsty now, I think I'll have some beer!"" Bite me Nic, and Jay, you can suck my back. Being hungry has made me an anger ball."

"event","We got the house. I am Jack's excitement! I have been living in the pink house in M section for almost a week by my lonesome (not counting one smartass parrot). Of course my room would have the only entrance to the attic, which the landlady claims has never been opened. Anyone else find that disturbing? Flashes of The Grudge come to mind. Finally the boys have moved in, and with style. Our first official meal in the house was steaks a la Jay. I think the classiest part was eating off of our overturned bookcase, or as Rose calls it, the tablecase. I love how we're too sophisticated and grown up to put a foosball table in the house, but eating off bookcases, now that screams adulthood! 
  Living with boys is going to be interesting. Already they are trying to break me of my freakish OCD tendancies. So I don't like it when people watch me spit when I brush my teeth? Does that really call for both Nic and Jay to rush into the bathroom to stare, mocking me? I am Jack's nervous tick. 
  Yesterday I spent the day at Waterworld with a good buddy of mine. Men on rides are NOT to be trusted. A double raft flips very easily when the 6 foot boy jumps ship leaving the 5 foot pocket sized person to fend for herself. Needless to say, bottom of the waterslide I was sputtering and cursing like a truck driver. The slides I wasn't so fond of, but the Lazy Lagoon...oh the Lazy Lagoon. I think we must have spent three hours floating along in tubes, baking in the sun. Oh skin cancer here I come!"

"event","I'm moving on August 1st. In the past four years, I think I have moved at least seven times. This can't be normal, or healthy. Yet for some reason, life throws me a curveball and once again I am forced to pack up all my worldy possessions into badly put together cardboard boxes and make my exit.
This time, I'm excited to move. I can already tell that my new roommates are going to be fun to live with. Every time we hang out I end up laughing until my face hurts. We are in a word, random. 
  However, there is one thing impeding my excitment of this move. We haven't found a house yet. Now this wouldn't be such a big deal, except the first is in FOUR DAYS! I should rephrase that earlier statement. We have found a house, we are in love with said house, but the realtors are making us go through more hoops than a trained Australian Shepard. The phrase ""We'll get back to you"" reverberates through my ears, and simultaneously I get the urge to vomit. When I am nervous and stressed, my stomach is my bitter enemy. 
  Today once again, I am waiting anxiously by the phone, and I get the feeling that I am a giggly teenager, just waiting for that dreamy boy from fourth period to call. Does he like me, did I seem too eager? I loath this."

"event","Well the past few weeks have been interesting. The last week of August consisted of me, my two roommates, two FLAMING homosexuals sleeping on the floor, and a scared small town white boy on the couch. Needless to say, it was a peculiar week. Well, the girls went home at the end of the week, the guy on the couch found an apartment, (Thanks to George! You rule!) and now things are semi back to normal.
School is high stress, but my classes are at least interesting. I have this music class, LOVE IT! 
So my birthday is this next Saturday. I'm a little worried, I have this curse of the bad birthdays. But so far Carlo has been perfect, so maybe he will just break that curse. He already gave me a present, probably the best gift I've ever recieved. (charm bracelet)
We went to the beach last week, and collected rocks. I don't know why, but it was such a nice day, just being next to him, with the ocean right there. Can't help but think how lucky I am right now, but of course worry about how long it will last. Guess I can just count my blessings for now. Life is good."

I stay in Napa as much as I possibly can, I'm having the most fun I think I've ever had in my life. Carlo has consistently managed to knock me off my feet at every opportunity. I feel like I'm in the middle of this really great romance, and I really don't want anyone to wake me up from this dream.
As of yesterday its officially been one month since we started dating. Usually at this point I tire and grow bored with the person I'm seeing, or I start to see their true, more devilish side. With Carlo, I'm still weak in the knees everytime he walks in the room.
School is peeking around the corner, and I'm not ready to go back. I have the most hectic schedule for the fall. I just don't know if I'm up for the constant headache that is going to accompany the heavy load of classes. But I think I will manage, and Carlo will be a welcome break.
George is back home, that's pretty cool. Hopefully he'll work this lving stuff out so that he can relax and we can start working on some songs and stuff. That would be awesome.
My friends from back home are planning on visiting soon, that should be fun. ( I hope!)"

Things have been pretty great around here, I'm kind of floating on that whole cloud nine feeling. Its kind of scary, I met someone who is totally amazing, and everyday I feel like I like him more and more. I just worry that I'll get too comfortable, and WHAM, something will happen to take him away. Kind of a sad way to look at life I know, but that's what happens when you've been burned I guess.

I'm beginning to see the value of a true friend. Its amazing how when something bad happens to one of my friends, its not just that someone who grieves, but all of my friends. They band together and form a close-knit circle of caring, and envelop that person to shelter their pain.

But, thankfully, this is the last week. I'm glad I took classes and everything, but it is SO incredibly hard! Seven units was too much for five weeks. Ok, enough of me whining.
So its great being off campus finally. I love our apartment, we're still adding things here and there, but it is awesome. David, my other roommate is moving in on the first of August, can't wait! Then we'll be finally settled. Till then I still haven't been able to fully decorate and all, but its looking good. 
I'm still working at the mall, and its ok. I just wish I could get more hours, living on your own is expensive!!
I promised myself I wouldn't write anything too personal in here, but I will say this: I am now single. Its strange, but I think its a good thing. Shawn and I are still good friends, but I realized that we were just not meant to be in a romantic relationship. I think our breakup was one of the most amicable ones I've ever had, that's gotta be a good thing.
This weekend I'm going to celebrate the end of summer school with a bonfire, typical SF student fashion. :-) Should be a lot of fun. 
I'm ready for my summer to start, enough of this responsible studying business, time to get FREAKY!"

"event","Wow...its been a long time since I've written anything in here. I've been really busy. The semester is winding down, and things are changing at a pace that is definitely too fast for me. Its a very strange point in life. I guess its a little bit like graduation, on the one hand I couldn't wait to leave and start a new life, but on the other there was this touch of sadness, and I didn't want to say goodbye to everything I'd ever known. Ok, so its not quite as dramatic, but it is definitely excitement tangoing with sadness.
I don't want to see all my new friends leave for the summer, I'm going to miss them so much, especially my boyfriend, although I know time apart will strenghten our relationship immensly. I will be traveling to LA to visit him though, which is something I'm really looking forward to. I've never been to LA, plus, I have already gotten to know some of his closest friends from home, so I won't be going there and meeting everyone for the first time. That would be a bit too much!
Ok, the things I'm looking forward to are first of all, the apartment! We just put the deposit down today, and I can't believe we got this amazing place. Its in such a good part of town. Its weird, I feel too old somehow. I'm not supposed to be living alone! Slow down life! :-) But I'm enjoying it, its very liberating this feeling.
Second, I really want to work with George this summer on Avenue. He'll be close by in Santa Rosa, and I hope we'll develop our style and maybe get a few small gigs. That would be a dream come true! Right now we're just trying to find a spare moment so we can record. Its frustrating that neither of seems to have time. It is understandable, there is so much to do at the end of the semester. I have to start packing stuff up in a few weeks. Then there's finals. Ugh...
Well tonight I will be seeing Spiderman with Shawn. I'll let you know if it was any good, I've heard great things."

In other news, I wrote a song awhile ago, and I'm excited about recording it. George and I are going to record all of our songs. So here's the lyrics that I wrote.

I see your face in a picture frame,
Reminding me things aren't the same.
Where once trees blew their gentle breeze,
Now buildings bearing down on me.
[chorus]
A million people, not one repeats.
Please take me back to familiar streets.

Where once the robin sang me to sleep,
Now the sound of car alarms creep,
Into my dreams, late at night.
Makes me wish for you tonight.
[chorus]
[bridge]
[chorus]
I sit alone at night and cry,
And I can't help but wonder why,
Things can't stay just the way they were,
I'm not ready to face the future."

The sun is out, the pharamones are pulsating, there is an essence of spring in the air. I have currently been on the hunt for an apartment for the summer with my roommate Mary. Well today, we struck gold. We found the cutest place in Daly City that is perfect for us.
Its a two bedroom place on the third floor of an apartment complex. Right when you walk in the door, the view takes your breath away. You can see all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. Its amazing! The rooms aren't that big, but that's ok, cause we have a nice sized living room, kitchen, and (Yay!) a bathroom with a tub.
I just hope we get the place, now we have to go through credit checks and that whole boring mumbo jumbo. It gets so confusing when its about money and legistics. Makes me feel too old at times.
So enough about housing. I realized that I don't write in here enough, and my indiviual entries are just too dang long. I'll start writing more, I swear! :-)
I guess I will leave this entry at that, but I just have to say one more thing. Being in a relationship right now is so great!! Its funny, at times it can be the hardest thing to deal with, but when it comes right down to it, he is what makes me smile. -romantic sigh-LOL"

I am a little concerned about the way I sing and the way George wants our band to sound. I feel a little inadequate, or maybe just not what he needs. I really really want to be in a band, always have, but I wonder if my type of music is really George's style. It might not be, and that's a worry. Oh well, I won't concern myself with it too much at the present time.
So my boyfriend and I have been talking, and we've decided to make a list of what we want to do in the city and the bay area before the semester is over and he goes back to LA. We've come up with quite a few things, and I know we'll have more. I thought I'd just share them with the cyberspace universe. Some of these are touristy, but I still think they'd be fun, and hey, I live in the city, I have to do these at least once.
1. Walk across the Golden Gate
2. Twin Peaks (I've been there, but Shawn hasn't.)
3. Berkeley; I haven't seen much except frat row, and I KNOW there is more to it then that!
4. Great America
5. Marine World
6. The zoo
7. Golden Gate Park
8. Japan and China Town
9. Rocklin
10.Raves
11.Clubs: Popscene, Faith, Limelight
12.The Wharf
There's a lot more that I can't think of, and that are a lot less tourist trapesque, but I'm sleepy. I'm excited about doing all of them, especially with Shawn. Its nice to have someone to share these things with."

You see, I've never been to a concert, and let me tell you, this was a great first. The minute we got there, my friend Tynan and I decided we had to get to the middle of the action. We wove our way through the sea of people, and jammed like sardines we waited in heavy anticipation for Incubus to come onstage. About fifteen minutes later, they finally came out, and we started to rock. I stayed in the mosh pit for about four songs, which I was really proud of seeing as though I'm as small as I am. ( 5 foot nothing people should really be careful:-)) After the fourth song, I'd had enough, and my friends lifted me up, and for a brief second I crowd surfed. Possibly the most exilerating feeling of my life! When I got to the end, past the barrades, security let me down, and I was about three feet away from Brandon. Yay! The rest of the concert I wandered around alone just jamming to the music. My body is beat up from the pit, but it was worth it. I'd see them again anytime. This was hopefully the first of many more concert experiences to come.
Incubus really inspired me to want to get started with the band. I love the idea of getting onstage and having people cheer like mad, just for your songs. How great would that be?"

Its like, the heart is the bad friend, always trying to get the head in trouble. Like that friend you have that's always trying to get you to go out and party when you know you have to study for a midterm. That's what my heart is like, always getting me into trouble. 
Lately I have been trying really hard to be this perfect girlfriend. I have had a string of bad relationships that have always ended in this soap operaish sob story way, and I don't want this one to have that same fate. But sometimes I feel as if all my efforts are in vain, and I wind up doing something inherently ""girlish"" like getting emotional over nothing. That's when the Emotions vs. Common Sense fight breaks out, and my damn emotions always kick ass.
For example, I will be having a conversation with my boyfriend, and I know I shouldn't say certain things, or I know I shouldn't let what he says affect me so much, but of course I do exactly what I know I shouldn't. I wish at times I could take a step back, and view my life and myself as an outsider. I know then I could make the right choices, and not always wind up in the doghouse. One day I will learn how to behave in a relationship. Or, if not that, at least how to not take everything to heart."

I wish there were a universal application so that I could just print it off my computer and be done with it. Instead, I have to write repeatedly where I worked, why I quit, yadayada. What I hate the most is the description of the job. That's when I really think, now why do I want another job? Because it reminds me of just how tedious and useless my last job was. To me, the job application is a way to get people to not want to work at all, sort of like unemployment.(Hmm..I wonder if a college student can get unemployment?) I go through this lame process, only to get a callback from a job I really don't want.

So George has been helping me on that quest, but we are having a time issue. Mostly, its that by the time we go to practice, the RAs on duty get a hair up their butt and have to come break up the music. -sigh-Anyway, our practice sessions go more along the lines of George singing and playing the guitar while I try to pick up the chorus and sing along. Usually I just hum.
Its a little known fact that I really enjoy singing, probably because I don't do it too much; at least not in front of other people. On of these days I will get more confidence, and the world, as they say, will be my stage."

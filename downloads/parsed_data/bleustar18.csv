"event","Well today was an ok day. I went to a fabric store and purchased fabric to learn to sew on my sewing machine. I'm not good at it at all. I cnt even make a straight line for a hem. I'm a little discouraged but hopefully i'll do better tomorrow."

"event","Well heres a little update on me.. 

Christmas was great... got a sewing machine so now I'm really trying to learn how to make some stuff. I think my first article will be a hankercheif skirt. We'll just see how that turns out. So for the next few weeks while I'm home I'll be busy trying to make some stuff.

Went out yesterday night with my good ol' buddies that I used to hangout with Freshman year. It was so much fun I had a great time. I finally went to a real New York City night club and had a great time. It feels kind of good to have friends that I can go out with and have a girls night out. It was tons of fun. 

So the new year is coming up and I wanna start with a resolution. I know it's kind of stupid and no one ever really keeps them, but I want one as a promise to myself. I wanna create one that is reachable and obtainable. Something that i can accomplish and feel great about myself once the year is over. I have alot of work to do and some things to think about with in myself. Once I come up with a resolution i wanna print it and frame it to put up on the wall and look at it everyday so i can remind myself of what i need to do. 



WELL I THINK THATS ABOUT IT ... smell ya lata!"

"event","Thank you Kristen for the sweet sweet comment, it made my day, and no Erin I can't ever escape you lol. I like this live journal stuff, i can write out everything thats wrong and breathe a little easier when I'm done. lol 

So anyway today was better than yesterday, I went out to eat with my mommy, the food was good but I forget how expensive NY dinners are. But i didnt pay so eh. Darren's out with his Lincoln and Sigma friends, so I can get a quiet night at home. I got a call from my aunt asking me about what i was doing in Feb. I told her i have school and she was like oh then forget it. 
i was like forget what??? 
Yeah she tells me she has a sales meeting in Miami Feb. 1st and wanted me to tag along.
DAMN SCHOOL!!! I could've had some fun in the damn sun, but instead i'll be bitter in the snow in Buffalo."

"event","Well I found out yesterday that I failed this stupid class that I thought I was doing ok in. I was taking it pass/fail and I failed. Doesn't that just suck. Anyway, I've decided not to go to FIT in the fall, I'm just going to wait 'til January '05 and graduate a semester behind. I'm a little pooped about it, but i just dont think i'm ready, and my grades are really low so I need some time to pick them up. I think a big part of me just isn't ready to be a big girl and do big girl things. I feel like shit, like I'm letting people down or maybe I'm just letting myself down. But hey, I don't know what else to do. So yeah this is the start of what seems to be a pretty crappy vacation... what to do... what to do..."

"event","Sry people but emo dallas is back

so scratch the last update, there is not longer gonna be a kurt and dallas, he is now allowed to hang out with his ex again so there probably gonna go back out because "" he doesnt want to give up on her and him"" wtf? so he'll give up on me and him? thats just UGH! im tired of guys ! why is it that i always fall for  JACKASSES! 

me and ktina came up with something earlier, you know the saying ""nice guys finish last"" well its also ""nice girls finish last"" the nice girls get over looked, for being sometimes ""selfish or snobby"" so the so called nice guys never speak up ... so yeah, basically what im tryint to say is, that nice guys finish last because thats there choise and nice girls finish last because they get over looked and choose the wrong guys.

but w/e my moms bitching at me, this whole kurt thing is getting to me, im getting scared for my recitl i just have all this shit on my mind and i dont know what to do so im going to end this update here. bye

"event","Okay i havent updated in a while so here i go.

Nothing really has happened, just been hanging with friends, working, and rehearsing, cause my recital is sunday, so everyday this week i have something going on, like yesterday i had jazz, today i have ballet, tomorrow i have opening&finale rehearsel, friday i have jazz tech rehearsel at the artmeus ham hall, sat. i have opening and finale tech rehearsel, then later that night i have ballet rehearsel, then on sunday i have dress rehearsel in the morning, then the show that night, so im a busy person .. wow .. lol and yeah. 

Last night was crazy but great, okay i had to work yesterday 9-3, then after work i went home, kurt and justin came over, and my mom forgot i had a doctors appoinment, so they decided they would go with me ( along with ktina) so we all go there, i get my presciption filled then we head home, hang out, we all fight over the bed, somehow all 4 of fit lol and at some point me and kurt started holding hands and then i had to get ready to go to dance, so we all leave and some of my friends are all like "" are you and him going back out"", "" who are the 2 guys you were with"" blah blah, and i kept saying nope, still ex's and then after dance, they were hungry so we went to jack in the box, i said hey to my co-workers, got food ( oh yeah i get discounts ! lol) and we ate then left, back to my house we went, we decided to watch van wilder, that movie is ilarious .. but yeah first we watched it in my room, kurt decided to lay head in my lap, and then we went to the living room, cause my mom and step-dad decided to go to there rooms, and me and kurt held hans, and he put his arm around me during some point and i looked up at him for some reason and he kissed me .. of course i kissed him back but yeah .. i missed that, i still like kurt, and i want to go back out with him, but i dont know if he wants to go back out with me, but since he kissed me doesnt that mean something, or did he just want to ""hook up"" which would suck but yeah .. 

i just wish that i could be happy in a relationship again, and not be soo ""emo"" i hope me and him will get back together, when i was with him, was when i was the happiest, i have been for awhile. but yeah, i dont know, i should go cause i have to shower and get ready for ballet and everything, so hopefulyl i will remember to update again lol, not like anyone probably reads this anymore though.

i've been feeling kind've depressed latly ... i miss 2 of my ex's. mike and kurt. the longest relationships this year. the best relationships this year. i dont think me and mike should've broken up .. it was a stupid excuse i used, and i dont know if i can fix things now cause hes not gonna go to vo-tech next year, i dont know maybe i should try and comvince him to go back, i think i might do that because i really want to see what happens.  and with kurt thats just a whole complicated issue. i mean hes cofnused me so much i dont even know if its worth it, and hes the 1 that hurt me. and im the 1 that hurt mike and now i have to live with that guilt, and there hasnt been a day this summer that i havent thought about him or kurt and its just ugh! im used to getting text messages from them like daily and its weird. and i dont know. maybe its just me being single thats getting to me, i have no idea ! but i wish i knew ! i wish i could everything straight! but im just so freakin stressed out because of dance and work, i feel like im gonna have a breakdown any day now but yeah well im gonna end this update here because i need sleep.

VALENTINES DAY SUCKED MAJOR BOOTAY THIS YEAR! because i didnt have a valentine... and it just made me think ALL day and if you know me then you know its not save to have me think. because all that went through my head was exes. lol because if me and kurt would've stayed together then it would've been me and his 3 month. but nooooo he broke up with me. and last year i had a valentine who was tyler. and yeah we all know how that ended so i dont need to write about it. i got valentines from my friends though! yay!!

"event","okay i think for a while now i will actually be happy and not be sooo depressed. Things are getting really good for me and its like weird cause its all happening at once, i got an aweome boyfriend who i can tell cares about me as much as i do him, whenever were around eachother were always smiling and its just great. hehe and its all thanx to k*tina!! cause he goes to rancho and she likes his best friend and yeah. and me and my mom and have gotten a long alot better now, which is goood, but it sucks because she broke her knee so she can't walk for like 2 months, and i have to take care of her and that means moneys gonna be tight at my house so i wont be able to much stuff. which is ok, i'll deal with it.  well i hope i get to see kurt either today or tomorrow [ kurts my b/f ] cause if justin gives k*tina a ride home they usually drop her off at my house so i get to see my baby. which is awesome and k*tina and justin will go out soon...hopefully. but yeah i think thats it for this update cause yeah im bored and i have to go to the orthodontist so yeah.

"event","the grude is an awesome and scary movie! i saw it yesterday it was great. today was pretty fun today except for the fact that i had to wake up at like 6:30 even though i kinda went back to bed and then woke up at 7 to go to rancho with k*tina for her drill practice. it was a lot of fun because whenever they weren't doing anything we would just goof off, mason is mean he hit me in the head with a gatorade bottle and hit me with a rifle! lol and then devin kept giving me weird looks, it was pretty fun. im glad i broght my cd player or i would've gone crazy. i kept taking masons hat too. last night i watched freddy movies and i had a nightmare!! it was pretty funny though, i told k*tina it and of course she laughed at me. K*TINAS GONNA TAKE DANCE WITH ME NOW! omg im happy lol, this should be an interesting year of dance! well gotta go cause i have to take a shower, i will update tomorrow or something. kk love ya all byez.

"event","yo...whats up people? not to much here just the same old stuff, well last night was awesome, i went to the frightdome with k*tina [ of course with her, me and her are like insepartable] and we met up with casey and nikki, and then saw perry. and me, k*tina, casey and nikki were all in line for the inverter then nikki saw mark,edgar, louis, mikey and some other people and ditched me for them, but its ok i guess. So it was me, casey and K*tina for a lil while then me and k*tina saw perry so we all 4 hung out and decided that we wanted to go into a haunted house. [ i was basically dragged into it...haunted houses scare me] and when we were in line we saw johana, kelley, Kurt and Justin. Kurt is so hot and Justin is a cutie. And when we were in line this guy dressed up as a clown had a chainsaw...[ 3 things ims cared of: chainsaws, micheal myers and clowns] so i like hid behind kurt and everyone was making fun of me...by saying "" come over here"" blah blah and i was freaking out. then in the haunted house i was like grabbing onto justins arm and i think i cut off his circulation lol and then a chainsaw dude started to chase me, so i kinda dragged Justin and then pushed him into a wall on accident...lol then me and k*tina had to go so i hugged kurt <3 lol and then left. then today me and k*tina went to hollywood video and rented 3 freddy movies then went to barnes and nobles to get some stuff and then went to the mall. I picked up my shoes cause they had to order them since they didn't have them in my size and then we went over to hot topic. me and K*tina were in heaven because there was a lot of hot guys lol and like 2 guys that were wearing a7x shirts talked to us cause kt was wearing an a7x shirt, it was great. I got a 311 shirt which is pimp and i got a greenday wristband which is pimp too and i also got pretty underwear lol. And K*tina got 12 gauge earrings and it came with 3 pairs so she gave me, so now my ears are gauged to a 12 and pretty soon im gonna gauge them to a 10. My mom saw my ears and didn't even notice anything so yeah. things between me and my mom are going good i guess, she said sorry for a lot of shit so yeah. today was sad, me and k*tina decided to watch moulin rouge which wasn't very smart of me to do because it made me think about a lot of stuff which i can't seem to get my mind off of that subject latly. but oh well as much as i say i'll get over it i know i won't so i just have to deal with it. i guess. well i've made this update long enough so i will update another day. I love you K*tina, Lacey and Megan! you guys rock <3333

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
But I love you until the end of time

"event","why can't my mom just leave me alone? she thinks shes making things better when shes really making things worse. Shes just making me think of my ex when i don't want to cause everytime i do i start to break down in tears. me and him are still really close friends but it jsut hurts to think about when we use to be together and now i see how happy he is with his new g/f and i wonder, ""does she make him happier than what i did"" and i don't wanna wonder things like that cause it  just makes me more upset, i just wish i could turn back time and fix whatever things i messed up but i know i can't and it sucks so much. i guess this jsut another part of the break-up. Coping with new b/f's or g/f's and missing them. i know im never gonna be able to get over him. i wish there was some way i could but i've tryed so many times, you can't get over your 1st love. i know im just blabbing on but i really need to let all of this out. i think im just gonna end this update here."

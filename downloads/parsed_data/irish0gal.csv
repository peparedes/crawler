"event","ok so i'm walking past old main building last night, which i've decided looks alot like the building that gets hit by lightning in that back to the future movie, and i look at old main and it has this spotlight on the clock tower portion of the building. Now, normally this wouldn't be creepy cuz lots of buildings have lights on them at night. but then i realized why this image was so creepy to me... I looked up at the sky and it was very dark, but i could see the clouds above me. But then there was an opened cirlce of no clouds over old main which looked like this dark hole of nothingness. It kinda looked like the sky was going to swallow us up through that hole in the clouds starting with old main. Or maybe i'm just going crazy and that's what crazy people see. Either way, it was cool and i wish i had my camera with me cuz that would have been a priceless picture.

"event","I found out on thursday that my lab is like done already...even though we're supposed to have another two or so weeks left. Apparently she cut out enough stuff that she felt wasn't necessary so that we can end really early. So i only have to go on tuesday to hand in my final product sheet and then take a theory quiz and then a notebook quiz. Personally, i would have liked to do the other labs just cuz i always find labs fun, but then again, i'm not complaining that two weeks of class and stuff being graded is being cut out!

Friday was the final in the first semester of the orgo lecture. I felt pretty good about the exam... nothing i'd never seen before or had no clue how to do. I think i did really well on the multiple choice and i did my best on the essay part, but i can never judge with chem exams.

The funniest thing happened today...i got a package in the mail from katie and my mom's like, ""who's that from... the handwriting looks like yours."" So when i told her who it was from she's like... woah that's kinda scary that her handwriting is that similar to yours.

I gave Rosie a full body hair cut today so she looks like 10 years younger. It's amazing how she grows gray hair when her hair gets longer, but then when i cut her hair it's like night black. Plus she's all soft now and hopefully this'll help keep her cool since we rarely use air conditioning in our house. 

Anyway, i'd gone to the TA office hours on thursday after my lab ended and i was talking to this guy... he was giant and looked like a football player. Anyhow i mentioned that i go to penn state and he's like oooooh! are you goin up for artsfest this weekend... which totally made me feel even worse about not being able to go which sucked. I don't think he meant it but it totally wasn't cool being as i already hate it that i'm home bored stiff and fighting off my mom telling me when i can and can't watch tv (what, does she think i'm 5 or something???) But the dude went on about a story of when he was in state college when that riot happened so i think he felt special that someone actually knew what and where he was talking about. Although, he definitely had no clue on the material for the exam.I tried to help, but for some people, there's only so much you can do. But while i was there i did help a few other people there... they were so appreciative that i was able to explain to them the mechanisms of the reactions that they were like, have you ever considered teaching? Actually i had, but that doesn't pay much.... and i'd rather make more money until i can be in a situation where i can do whatever i want.

My parents are really starting to get to me. My dad keeps going on and on and on about stuff when he really has no idea what he's talking about. Like the other day when i was telling them about the football player who was talking to me about the riot at psu artsfest and my dad starts going on about what the riot was like and stuff. I just got furious... i was like, you have no idea what state college is like when things like that happen. And how dare you take generalizations of college parties and riots and make it sound like you were there or something. And he even said something that was completely wrong which pissed me off too. Why the hell is he talking about stuff he doesn't know about and don't fucking try and make it sound like you know more about it than i do when you've spent an entire 5 hours in the place in the past 2 years. Then there's my mom and she's getting on my last nerve. Yesterday night she's like, ""i'm sooo tired."" So i was like, um well why don't you add a 3 hour final to that and a week's worth of studying and lack of sleep to that. For some reason she thinks that becuase she gets up 15 minutes earlier than i do that she does more than i do in the day. And then today... i got up, cut rosie's hair, and then vacuumed all before matt got up. But then when she exiled me from helping her make food for the party she and my dad were going to tonight she comes into the living room to tell me to turn off the tv. Who the hell does she think she is... what else am i going to do? She tells me i'm not going fast enough to help her, but i can't watch tv?? what am i 5 and she needs to remind me to wipe my ass too? After a final all i want is to sit around and crap out and just relax for a while but she has to be a fucking pain in my ass and try and control my fucking life. Well guess what mom... my life already sucks and i don't need you making it worse! i wanted to tell her to go to hell so bad, but i'd go to hell if i said that to her... and she'd make my life hell for saying that.

...and tuesday's the last time i'll see hot orgo lab air force guy :-( it's so sad. He reminded me of someone.... i can't figure out who, but something about him is so familliar it's so weird

"event","This week is my last week of summer session 1 classes...woohoo!!! But i have a final on friday so it's still kinda stressful until then. However, i did the math and figured out that i need a 75% on the final to get an A- in the class. I think i'll be ok cuz if i do the same as i've been doing on the other two exams, then i'll definitely have the A- which is awsome considering that i've done at least 30 points higher than the average both times and this is most definitely not an easy class. Plus considering that i had to drop this class the last time i took it, it feels really good to kick this classes ass ;-)

However, as soon as i finish this class, the next session starts monday and thus the second semester of ochem begins. But my lab only goes for two or three more weeks so i'll have lots more time when the lab finishes and then i'll only have to get up at 5am three days a week... you can't imagine how nice that sounds. 

Rosie definitely did not like that yesterday was the 4th of July. If i'd have to guess, i'd say that's her least favorite holiday. She spent most of the day (and night) shaking like a madwoman. Poor rosie. 

And i remember now why i hate LI weather... could it BE any more humid??? my carpet feels like someone dumped gallons of water on my floor :-/ And the stillness makes outside smell like rotten peppers mmmmmm. Although i've got a nice tan now hehe

here's to randomness!"

"event","So plenty has happened since my last post...

First of all, my neighbor's surgery was successful. She has had minimal problems post surgery. she's had the simptoms of a minor concussion which is pretty good for someone who had major surgery to remove a brain tumor. They didn't even have to shaver her head or anything which is great for her self esteem and stuff. It's just amazing cuz they went from her possibly having a 70% chance of losing her ability to speak and changed their route last minute so that that possibility was avoided completely. But she was only in the hospital for like 4 days post surgery and then came home and was walking around all normal and everything... only she had to sit up to sleep cuz the pressure of laying down was too uncomfortable. But still, i'm amazed that she was so good 4 days after surgery that she felt like going to the beach. 

My other neighbor across the street... his son had been diagnosed with skin cancer which had become too advanced to stop. So his son had gotten so bad that he was told he had 4 weeks to live so my neighbor flies out to colorado to be with him in the hospital (his son must be in like his 40's). And in his last few weeks he was going in and out of comas and my neighbor and the nurse were in the room while the son started talking to someone... but he wasn't talking to either of them. He was talking to his friend Booz who had died about a month before this day in some sort of accident. The reason they knew who it was was cuz he had called whoever he was talking to by this. Anyway, he'd talked to Booz a few times in and out of comas and the last time he spoke to him he said, ""alright Booz, i'll see ya thursday at 9 then."" He died that thursday at 9pm. My parents were told this story by my neighbor at the wake this past wednesday. I was definitely kind of freaked out... but in a good way. Like, i feel like i'm being watched out for all the time by someone. And i'm now convinced that there is an afterlife. 

And i met the conductors on the train. I'm now buddies with conductor Greg and Conductor Tom! It's kinda cool to have people ask you how you're doing every morning and stuff cuz everyone on the train wonders how i know them and stuff. Little to they know that i'm not connected in any way, i'm just really friendly to people who talk to me so when they asked my why i was always reading that just started an hours worth of talking about penn state. Apparently conductor tom's son went to penn state's football camp so he was really impressed with me going there. They don't even look at my ticket anymore though... it's funny. I bet i could just ride the train for free and they wouldn't care. 

And i just got a 108 on my first ochem exam so i'm pretty psyched. I've got another exam on wednesday so we'll see how that goes...

For my birthday i got the cutest little pill box from my mom. She's also gonna take me clothes shopping but i'd seen this pill box in this little cottage irish store we go to and thought it was really cute but not the kind of thing i could get for someone else as a gift so i just passed on it. Well she rememebered and got it for me :-D which is funny cuz i'd totally forgotten about it until i opened the box and saw it.

And my dad fixed my old stupid printer that wouldn't work. We think that the black ink cartridge was leaking which is why there were piles of dried ink inside the printer. And this ink had gotten on the mechanisms that pull the paper through the printer which is why my printer kept telling me there was a paper jam. But i have a new printer now so there's no way that i'm taking him back... once a leaker, always a leaker."

... one thing i wanna figure out this year is: why do all people ask me questions... like what train is this or how does HBr react with an alkene. And they ask me as if for some reason it seems that i would know. I just don't get it. AND why do people i don't like still talk to me... am i not mean enough to people i find annoying??"

"event","i went to the high school to pick matt up but no one was there who i wanted to talk to so i had to leave notes in their mailboxes :-(. But i got to talk to mrs. Feeney a little bit which was kinda cool. But i kind of remember why i never had a desire to go back and see that place again. Because there are so many whores that go there. I mean, the numbers have like tripled in the 2 years i haven't been there which is amazing. 

Anyway, in an attempt to avoid doing chem work this morning i went outside and weeded for my mom around the pool  so she can plant flowers and whatnot. But so i came in when i was halfway done cuz my shoulder was itching. But it looked really red so i was kinda puzzled cuz usually a sun burn doesn't itch... it hurts. So anyway, when i got inside i realized that the reason it was red was not cuz i was burnt but because i had a giant bug bite that was making my entire shoulder swell... thus the redness. So i put dome alcohol on it to stop it from itching and then went back out to finish the job i'd started. I finished and came back in and noticed like an hour later that my back is cherry red only by chance walking my the mirror in my room. And now it hurts and it's making me shiver :-(

My neighbor went into the hospital this past wednesday. The did initial surgery which means they opened up her skull and made sure that they knew where all the parts of her brain were so that they knew where they were going when they do the tumor removal surgery... basically mapping out her brain before they go in and do the actual surgery. Her dad came by and said that everything's going well so far. The doctors are very confident after that initial procedure because everything appears to be very ""textbook."" And we haven't heard anything bad yet. She's awake and stuff... reading and watching tv and sleeping till the next stage of the procedure. 

And i had another freaky dream but i didn't write it down in time to remember it :-(. I should really keep a dream log but i don't know if i'm organized to do that.... that and i'm not sure if i'd have enough time in the morning to actually write down what i dream at night since i only have like 40 minutes to get ready and only just make it out of the house in time.

"event","Goin to the high school today to pick up matt and apparently a new fish that will be joining our household. It's one of those japanese fighting fish. So my mom went looking all over the house to see if we have one of those bowls to put it in. Well instead she found a GIANT brandy glass. I swear this thing could hold a gallon of brandy. but it's in the shape of a brandy glass. And of course only MY parents would have one of these things sitting around in the house. So the new fish will be residing in the giant brandy glass. Maybe we'll put a plant or something in there with him cuz i bet he'll get lonely in there and a plant is a wonderful friend for a fish.

I'll probably talk a bit with mrs feeney about research and stuff and then i have to either leave a letter in mr katcher's mailbox or go catch him before he leaves to give him my email. And then if i have time try and say hi to miss pagano. Hmm maybe this means i'll have to get there like an hour before school starts.... we'll see"

"event","So i started classes and stuff. My chem lab is kinda cool. We actually do things that are like interesting and stuff. And of course the TA's look at my funny cuz i'm always laughing. Although i'm not sure if they think i'm nuts for enjoying lab this much or if they think i'm doing something wrong all the time which would explain the laughing coming from the corner of the room (where my bench is). I think that it should be the other way around... they should look funny at the students who aren't enjoying themselves in lab. I mean, if you can't make a good situation out of a bad one, then what good are you at life, seriously. But so me and the girl next to me are always giggling cuz my TA is funny looking and the lab manual is very vague so we always have questions. I dunno, i just guess that all i ever hear from people is them hating ochem lab cuz it's so time consuming and stuff, but i never hear people saying what a good time they had doing lab stuff in lab. I think that if more people would stop rushing to get out of the lab quickly then they'd enjoy the lab more and maybe (a) have a better outlook on science labs and labwork as a whole and (b)learn the technique and material better. 

And there are a bunch of hot guys in my class too ;-) . And for once i've talked to each of them. I think people just wanna talk to me in this lab cuz i always seem to be happy or smiling or laughing... which is a good thing. I think i'm gonna try and do this much more often.

And then there's lecture which isn't as bad as i thought it was gonna be really. I mean, don't get me wrong, the material covered by the lecture and the lab keep me working constantly. Like tuesday, woke up 5:30, train ride at 6:40 which left from a station 20 minutes from my house, and then i got into stony brook around 8am (after a bus ride to the library from the station). Class (which was lab yesterday) was from 9:30 to 2:30 and then i catch the train at 2:50 and get to syosset at 3:40 and my dad picked me up on his way home from work and we got home around 4:15. I took an hour break to watch ellen and then had dinner and went right back to work for my lecture the next day doing problems in the book and reading the next chapter till i fell asleep. Then i wake up and start all over again. 

My lecture professor is cool though. Even though we go through the material really quickly, because this is the second time i'm being taught the material AND i'm using a different method to learn ochem (meaning i read before i go to lecture and do the questions the night after the lecture so i'm like pounding the info into my head) things seem to be working well this time around. Plus my professor makes the funniest analogies. Like, to help with solubility of compounds.... molecules many times have polar and non-polar portions of the molecule and polar portions don't like the non-polar forms. But if you have a small molecule where the polar portion of the molecule is stronger than the non-polar substituents, then the molecule will be soluble in the polar substance. And he relates this to how when the parents leave the older child at home to watch the younger sibling but the older kid wants to go out somewhere, so they drag the sibling around whether the sibling wants to go or not... i mean, how creative is that?!? come on!

But so the other day i was sitting in lecture and all of a sudden i had this flash that i'd been sitting in this lecture hall in a dream i'd had a long long time ago. It was sooo weird. Like, i definitely dreamt that i was in this exact lecture hall yet i'd never seen it before the first lecture i'd had. So now i'm definitely convinced that i have some sort of psychic abilities.

And then i had this other dream recently. I was playing some sort of game with a bunch of people (mostly guys) and the game was like throwing a hatchet (well, it looked like a hatchet from far away which means it was probably like a large axe) and then someone on the other team had to catch it... it was like football with a hatchet as the ball. but so i was amazed that nobody was getting hurt playing this game. but then i decided that i had to try and catch the thing... so i run deep and turn for the catch and catch the axe thrown at me. But there was another part to it. The reason i came to play in the game (this was more of the feeling of the situation, nothing i'd dreamt before this scene) was because i'd come with this guys i was ""with."" So i catch the axe and apparently everyone was as excited that i was that i'd not only caught the axe but that i'd survived doing it. and they all come running to congratulate me... all except for the dude i came with. But that's not the important part cuz i didn't notice that till i woke up and thought about it. But so then this guy who i felt was like the dude i was with's close friend who i knew pretty well came running up to congratulate me with arms wide open so i jumped up and wrapped my arms around him and legs around him and he caught me and all of a sudden we look at each other and everything seems to change and he says to everyone around us, ""i guess i should tell him that we're together before he sees and gets pissed."" So then i'm at some like feast with the same people who i'd played the game with and all of a sudden we have to like fight a war with the pple at the other end of the room and the second guy saves me while the dude i came with is in the middle of the fighting. Then i woke up :-/ i was sad... i didn't want it to end cuz i wanted to see what crazy thing i'd dream up next.

ok that's enough for today... i'll update tomorrow cuz i'll be home all day and i think i'm all talked out for today...haha

Of course, then i'm up 5:30 am to catch a train for my first summer ochem lecture. Oh yeah i'm just thrilled about that one.

From here on in, i'll be a hermit in my room studying ochem. Hopefully i'll get out once in a while to get a little tan here and there.

By the way, read ""Five people you meet in heaven,"" ""1,000 White Women,"" and ""Angels and Deamons."" I'm currently reading the Count of Monte Cristo and then the divinci code is next. Gonna be a productive summer!"

"event","I found out about 2 weeks before the semester was over that my neighbor has a brain tumor. Being as i grew up with her and have been friends with her since she was born (literally) i was just a bit shaken. But so after getting through finals and all that good stuff i found myself home and almost scared to talk to her about it. What do i say... do i say anything...and how will i not get upset. Well, i haven't had the chance to talk to her cuz she's been in and outa the city getting tests done and stuff, but i've been going through pictures and stuff. It kinda makes me sad though cuz i look at all these times when i was so carefree and happy and loving life and not caring what comes tomorrow. But things just aren't that way anymore.

I mean, i know everything's gonna be fine but it's like everything all of a sudden has gotten so serious. You know, school is serious and family is serious, but childhood and neighborhood people never got serious and i liked it that way. Things were always simple when the neighborhood pple got together and did stuff. It's like life's realities have crossed a line that wasn't meant to be crossed because the one thing that was always simple has now just gotten as difficult as everything else.

And it's funny cuz i don't wanna tell like everyone what's going on cuz not everyone would understand how close our two families are and have been for the past 20 years and how devastating this is for all of us as a whole... because honestly, the mckennas are part of my family as much as my cousins are. 

But at least i'll be around this summer. I can't stand it when i'm away and everyone here is sick and and stuff cuz there's nothing i can do. And even though i'm pretty sure there's still nothing i can do while here, at least i can be close if i *can* do something.

"event","so it's the end of the semester and i'm supposed to be studying for finals right now but since i'm headin out in a bit to do some disgustingly girly crafty stuff, i've decided to take a little time to reflect on this semester and the highlights and lowlights.

A major highlight was meeting some new friends. Me and sirinya got tight in HPA and lab and now jeff (our lab big brother) thinks we're attached at the hip. Sirinya also got me to start eating lunch at least three times a week, which is quite the accomplishment. However, does anyone else see my pattern of when things go crazy in my life i eat much much less than i really should. Ah well, at least it makes me feel better about one part of me. 

Anyway, this was a very lab-oriented semester. I think i bonded with almost everyone in lab (well, cept for dong cuz he never understands a word i say and vice versa). But i gained a new appreciation and respect for yulin. I used to be like scared of him and then we started talking and i learned that he's a trained doctor and chose to work for his PhD even after getting his doctorate degree in china. Xiaoyi is a character. Although, he definitely makes me feel incredibly smart cuz everything outa his mouth makes him seems dumber... and he's supposed to be my superior in a sense... even though i have to teach him how to do the procedures he has to do or is responsible for. Vivian seems to like me... sirinya may say that she can get bitchy, but she's only ever been nice to me so i have no complaints. Jianwen says very little, but he takes mine and vivian's side when we gang up on xiaoyi so he's cool. And aryn's just aryn...there are never any words that seem appropriate to describe him or my friendship with him and i think that's just the way it is... and that's a good thing

Things have been up and down with guy stuff. I followed this hot guy in my statistics class for most of the semester and he sat next to me for many of the classes... he just smelled so good. What can i say, i was drawn in. But i only talked to him like once or twice, so ah well. But i made friends with a bunch of other pple in my stat class... they're all honors pple. They're cool though. Then there's jay jay my ex-ta (that's what nicole calls him anyway). Yeah i don't know... we talk randomly and we'll always have the genetics grad student connection so i'm still waiting for that time when we're both at a talk or something and start talking and stuff. Plus, the fact that i'm not 21 seemed to be a big problem for hanging out with that situation since he's 26. Then there's the Jamie's friends fiasco. Yeah well her friend dan's friends (two of em) had crushes on me and i felt really stupid cuz i really wasn't attracted to either of em. But i still talk to them and we're cool now after some drama. I think we'll end up being pretty good friends since jamie and dan are in the same major and will be taking lotsa classes together in the future (and since nick's living with dan). But to tell you the truth, i'm looking forward to seeing their friend patrick again... he was such an irish hotty. Like seriously, he had the freckles, he's cute, he's funny and at the same time sort of shy around new people. he's also originally from california which i find really really hot.

With jamie and carrie things have been off and on all semester. I've been feeling very left out by both of them, but i think it's all on carrie really and jamie just goes along. but there was the incident where jamie told me she was going to go study at the hub with carrie and left with her bookbag... then hid it in her car (meaning it was all a hoax to trick me) and i don't know what they did instead but that pissed me off. Then there was when we went to carrie's house and i was told i was exiled to a different bedroom than the two of them. Then there was me overhearing them talking cuz jamie didn't want me in the car with her on the return drive home. Them there was the time that carrie's parents came up and carrie only asked jamie to go to a lacross game and lunch with her family... without me knowing so while i was home cleaning in preparation for carrie's parents to see the appartment, jamie was off getting a free meal. And finally there's the time that carrie's mom came up to bring some stuff home for her (before the end of the year). Apparently there was a second reason for her mom coming up:an air force awards ceremony. Yeah, guess who was and wasn't invited. Right. Sounds lovely doesn't it. And finally there's operation make katie starve. yes, as the end of the year approaches we divided up our grocery bills and evened it all out to we all paid equal amounts. And after that it was you buy it you eat it. Which is fine with me, excpet i can't really eat what i buy if no one tell sme when they're headin to the grocery store so i'm never able to buy any food for myself. Lovely. Well, seems like their plan is ruining sirinya's plan of getting me to eat, doesn't it.

So, all in al, what do we think? Ok semester, lotsa little stuff that really started to bug me, but lotsa stuff i wish i'd pursued more. Sounds like a typical semester in the life of Katie.

"event","ok so i've had to create this new journal cuz there's this dude who's kinda getting weird on me. He was looking at my subprofile alot and i asked him what part of it he was reading. His response... 'oh, i only look at it for the link to your livejournal.' He then proceeded to ask my why there's no talk of a boyfriend on the journal and stuff like that. Now, why didn't he just ask me... why read my journal, doesn't that sound a little creapy.

Anyway, i stayed here in PA for easter while all my roomates went home so i had the appartment to myself for the entire weekend. But see, he was here too and kinda asked me to go to dinner with him. I said that i'd see cuz i had alotta work to do... which i did. But i also don't wanna give him the wrong idea cuz i don't really like him the way i think he wants me to. Plus, if i did go to dinner, then i'd have to ask him if it was a date and then go through the whole 'let's just be friends' talk which wouldve sucked. But dinner never happened so i haven't had to do that yet.

However, on a brighter note, the hot guy in my stat class sat in my seat the other day. Ok, don't think me stupid... i've sat in the same seat all semester and everyone in the class sits in other seats cuz they know i sit there every day. And sometimes the hot stat guys sits next to me. But this time he sat in my seat. Nicole said i shouldve sat on his lap...hehe. No but i almost asked him if he had a partner for the extra credit project for the class, but never got up the courage to. He smelled sooo good... i think it was old spice :-D

the sky is so weird right now... it's like yellowish after the storm. Kinda like the light given off by an old lightbulb.And it's kinda hurting my eyes now :-/

... i'm off ;-)"

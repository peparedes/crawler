"event","Took this from <lj user=""jenovan"">'s LJ, 'cause I don't want to post the same comments over and over if everyone puts this up... XD Or doesn't. ;) Edited slightly (obviously) for questions about the ""asker"".

01. Your Middle Name, or explain your Chosen Name: My middle name is Joy, which is my mother's first name. XD
02. Mental Age: Hm, it varies. I'm really sort of immature a lot of the time. XD But also sometimes I feel really old because I'm all grown up and married and have a job and a cat and BILLS!
03. Single or Taken: You all know this one. XD
04. Favorite Book: This is really hard to say. I am actually HORRIBLE at remembering things I read, so while I could say ""I really loved this book I just read!"" I can't say with any confidence that it's better or worse than books I've read in the past. XD The book I remember liking best in a long time is <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> (which Kari may or may not be reading now XD) and its sequel.
05. Favorite Song or Album: I think I'm going to go with Thirteenth Step by A Perfect Circle. They ARE my favorite band, and that album kicks so much ass. XD
06. What do you believe is your calling in life? Your greatest passion? Telling people what to do. XD I've come to realize that I'm not good at being creative on my own, but I can really influence a project for the better with constructive criticism. ;) That's why I like being an editor. XD Someone else comes up with a good idea, and I tell them how to make it better. ;D
07. What's your worst recurring nightmare/biggest fear? I don't tend to have recurring nightmares, yay me. XD My biggest fear is drowning, specifically drowning in a car. XD I DID have a dream about that once, and it was traumatizing (it turned out I dreamed something that was actually happening at the time, I heard about it later on the news oO;; a bridge had broken and people were driving off, not realizing).
08. Faith, has you any? And if so, what, and if not, why not?: Not especially. I'm not keen on religious stuff... I think people can't really know what's out there, so why bother trying? I'm not, like, against God or anything. If he's out there, he is. If he isn't, he isn't. I try to live my life, y'know, the good way...without any of the spiritual stuff. XD
09. Do we know each other outside of LJ? Do we want to? Most of you, yes, somehow. XD I don't have many LJ-exclusive friends.
10. What's your philosophy on life? Hm. Sometimes it sucks, sometimes it's cool, but either way you have to live it. XD
11. Is the bottle half-full or half-empty? Well, it's obviously both, isn't it? XD
12. Would you tell me something painful if it was in my best interest? Depends on what it was...?
13. What is your favorite memory of us? This moment, you reading all this stuff about my life, bwahaha....
14. What is your favorite guilty pleasure? Ooh. Right now, totally reality TV about dancing ;D Also DRAMA BETWEEN MADE-UP CHARACTERS omfg XD I especially feel guilty about it because it's almost always with Steve. ;) Ah well.
15. Tell me one odd/interesting fact about you: I have never been drunk! I don't know if I've ever finished a whole glass of anything alcoholic. XD Maybe once a flute of champagne or something, although I don't think I even managed that at my wedding... XD
16. You can have three wishes what are they? NO MORE BIGOTRY. ><;; I hate when people hate people, especially if it's for no reason. Universal public transportation, so we can get rid of all the friggin cars. XD That I would stop being so nuts all the time ;D
17. What is your favorite food? PIZZA =d
18. Which country is your spiritual home? Er? I will say the UK. I always wanted to go there, and when I went there I TOTALLY fell in love with it.
19. What is your big weakness? See 17 and 14 ;D
20. Do you think I'm a good person? All of you, yes, or we wouldn't be friends ;) Although some of you are chaotic good and some are neutral good.... XD
21. What was your best/favorite subject at school? Anything related to language. English, French, Spanish, Japanese. :)
22. Describe your accent: Trying-not-to-be-midwestern with a dash of picked-up-something-weird-from-Steve. XD
23. If you could change anything about me, would you? Only if you asked me to. XD I assume you would know I had this person-changing ability ;D
24. What do you wear to sleep? T-shirt and cute pajama pants. They have to be CUTE. XD
25. Gender identity? Girl girl girl with a dollop of tomboy. XD
26. Affectionate/sexual orientation? It's kind of hard to say, as I've been with the same dude for uh, almost all of my sexually formative years. XD I am a firm believer that people should just accept whatever does it for them, you know? I formed this philosophy while listening to the Garbage song ""Androgyny"" which has the line ""Take what you need to turn you on"" XD I don't like to identify as anything sexually, really. Obviously I'm more than happy with what I have, but I wouldn't say that necessarily makes me ""straight"". Maybe somewhere out there is a girl I'd like. I just don't waste time worrying about it. ;)
27. If I only had one day to live, what would we do together? (If you have no idea, just say something crazy, it'll entertain me!) Whatever you like...it'd be selfish to do what I like, if it's your last day to live. XD
28. Will you repost this so I can fill it out for you? This is all sorts of paradox. ;)"

One: Take a picture of your bag.
Two: Now dump everything out, neatly adjust them, and take a picture (no matter how embarrassing).
Three: Talk about the items inside. Details, please.
Four: Tag 6 people

I won't tag you, but it's really fun to snoop. XD

So this is my purse. I bought it in Osaka, for 1,000Yen :D It is pretty awesome, and also has an expander zipper thing for when you have LOTS of stuff. Actually my purse varies with what it has inside...sometimes more junk than others. Items not shown here that are often inside include: umbrella, digital camera, electronic dictionary, ipod cord, cell phone charger, a bazillion more hair ties, Nintendo DS, various earrings and sometimes other jewelry...

Click on the cut to see inside...

So, this is all the stuff in my purse. I tried to arrange it into sections. ;D

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aposhsentinel/3483866982/"" title=""IMG_0771 by A Posh Sentinel, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3375/3483866982_4ef0834252.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0771"" /></a>
From the top left--the trash section. ;D Some discarded tissues, gum wrappers, receipts, and a ticket stub from Observe and Report. Case for my umbrella and pouch for a reusable bag, both empty. Oops. Under that is the ""beauty"" section, clear lip gloss, colored lip gloss, strawberry lip gloss...and cherry coke chapstick. Also a slightly crappy foldable mirror. Next to that is the pharmacy section. I have various intolerances/digestive issues X__X so I have pepto bismol, immodium, lactaid, also benadryl and an expired prescription for Allegra (actually I am getting a new one today YAY) and advil for Steve and a bandaid (Batman style!)

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aposhsentinel/3483870738/"" title=""IMG_0770 by A Posh Sentinel, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3599/3483870738_6aaf2f4b23.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0770"" /></a>
Personal care section, with lotion, sunblock stick, wet wipes, kleenex (and tissue holder from Japan), floss, travel toothbrush (from British Airways) and of course feminine products. X__X I end up with a lot of them in my bag because as I'm running out the door I go ""@#$% do I have?!?!"" and then grab some and jam them in my bag, whether there are some there already or not. XD Misc stuff, a lock for locker at the yoga studio, I &hearts; Brookline Booksmith button. Hair care: foldable hairbrush (from a hotel in Japan), four hair ties, headband, barrette I got from Mari (friend in Japan). Under that, cow with a clock in the middle (this used to be on the outside of my purse, but it's made of metal and it's hit me several times X__X), Capybara-san (won for me by Mana in Tokyo at one of those crane game things), and matches from Rock It, bar/grill in Chicago.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aposhsentinel/3483869482/"" title=""IMG_0768 by A Posh Sentinel, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3376/3483869482_6527734a5e.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0768"" /></a>
I cheated slightly and put my wallet and cell phone back in, because they were on the desk/coffee table respectively. But they're almost always in there. The wallet is from Harajuku, Tokyo (I saw it the first day and then dragged Steve through the sea of people on another day to go back and buy it XD). Next to that is a card case from Osaka--it has my subway card, library card, business cards, whatever. I left it at an airport over Christmas and FREAKED but got it back finally. To the left, the office section--two black pens, one pink, and one sharpie, plus mini notebook, post-it flags (oops?) and mysterious pen cap??!! Above is my iPod Touch (Mr. B) and my cell phone and keys.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aposhsentinel/3483056027/"" title=""IMG_0769 by A Posh Sentinel, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3632/3483056027_eaf04b9383.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0769"" /></a>
The grocery section! and also MJ's feet. Three teabags I stole from some hotel, a water bottle, and orbit gum (I love Orbit, but usually I go for sweet mint.)

I think that's everything :D Now show me yours!!!"

I seem exceptionally affected by nice weather and sunlight these days--I don't remember that happening so much in the past, but this spring I feel SO much happier and upbeat when the weather is nice. It's so funny, I was telling Steve earlier...friends who met me in high school or earlier tend to still think of me as being an optimistic, upbeat person. But friends who met me on the internetz or in college don't, really. I wonder if they would notice if I changed back, or if first impressions really do just stick around...

Anyway, work has been okay lately. Sometimes even fun. ;D I've been super busy since we got back from San Diego, both with catching up and with new projects that came in. I'm also using InCopy for the first time, which is sometimes challenging and often frustrating. It's also a real power trip, because when I want text moved I just move it. AWESOME!

I am totally loving belly dance classes. I've been going like...10 weeks now. In June, I'm going to dance in a show. :) http://thegoddessdancing.com/Chrysalis.htm I'm in the advanced beginner class right now, so I guess I can pick whether I want to do the beginner or advanced beginner dance, but I think I'll go with beginner...better to be one of the better beginners (if I can, even X__X) than one of the worse advanced beginners... ;D I spend a good deal of my time now dancing, looking at costumes, or driving Steve and MJ nuts playing finger cymbals badly =X I've only lost like three pounds, but I think my thighs are a lot smaller XD (hooray for impending shorts season...)

Everything is pretty much the same...? We got totally caught up on LOST in like three weeks. XD It's pretty nuts. Now we're actually watching it the day it's on (but not live, 'cause I have dance class till 9 and usually don't get home till 9:15 or so)! Also we got Guitar Hero: Metallica, which is pretty awesome and we should play more. XD Also we've been going for more walks, now that the weather is nicer. I really want to lose like ten pounds before the dance show. XD Buuuut I could really use a yogurt right now... =d"

Had a great, relaxing five days in San Diego. Here's a quick rundown:

Day 1 (Friday): Got in, felt sick, mostly hung out at the hotel.

Day 2 (Saturday): Intended to go to the park, ran into a parade, decided to avoid it and wandered around downtown. Saw a movie. Old town for dinner, crazy Mexican place. XD

Day 3 (Sunday): Our anniversary! We went to the zoo, then Sarah's Smash Shack.

Day 4 (Monday): Went to Coronado Beach, hung out in Coronado.

Day 5 (Tuesday): Finally went to the park. XD Hit the Museum of Science (dinosaurs!!) and the Japanese Friendship Garden (great lunch there =d). Then went back to the hotel and went SWIMMING and had room service and played pool at the sports bar, where I injured myself. XD

Now I have like fifty million hours of work to make up :( I did like 20 out of the 60 I should've done for two weeks."

I bought Jess's gazelle fitness thing, and promptly FUCKED my entire body with it. I pulled like every muscle in existence, and now I walk with a limp. Sigh.

"event","I get sick a lot. It's sooooo not cool. Right now I am sick. Doing work was pretty much torture, everything made me so stressed out. Even the thought of looking at polar bears made me want to cry, and I LOVE polar bears =/ It just takes me so much longer to think, because my head is so fuzzy, and every time I try to concentrate on something I just want to go back to bed... Not to mention I got something back that I thought was done and apparently the EiC hates ALL of the fucking photos.. ><;;

Guess that's a pro and con of working at home. I can't take a sick day (especially now that I'm trying to save up hours to take a vacation in two weeks), but I didn't have to drag myself in to the office, either... Blargh.

Work has been alternatingly awesome and sucktastic. I like to work on editing stuff, but I haven't been doing anything besides work and the hours seem to draaaaagggggg on... I get up, work until Steve gets home or after, eat dinner, watch some TV, and go to bed. I thought working at home would mean I had more time to do stuff! I just didn't realize ""stuff"" takes so long. X__X Even if I do end up cleaning, it'll take me two hours just to do half of the kitchen. And it's one thing for the hours to drag at an office, because then you get to go home and feel better. But here, the hours drag on and then I'm still here... No change of scenery often leads to no change of mood. It doesn't help that the house is a mess and it's even been shower optional a few times X__X It definitely adds stress to be in a messy environment. I've said it before, and I'll say it again...I miss having structure. I miss leaving the house. I know I could go out and work somewhere like Starbucks, but the time it takes to get ready and go there is time I could be getting PAID for if I was doing work at home.

Anyway, sorry to complain... I dunno. I know there are lots of people out there who would like to have my job. I would also like to have my job, it just gets me down sometimes X__X Especially when I'm sick.

On to other things... I think Steve wants to have a baby. He said not now, but I dunno... I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I get really scared that we'll never really be ready to have kids. I'm so immature and needy, how could I possibly be responsible for someone who's even more immature and needy than me? Anyway, where would we ever come up with the money for it? And I don't like the thought of not being able to do things I want, when I want (though see above for how many things I actually do...). I mean, we wouldn't be able to just pick up and go on vacation, or see a movie on a whim. There's more planning involved, and more things you just can't do. It's like a social death sentence. I don't know how or why other people do it..."

This offer does have some restrictions and limitations:
- I make no guarantees that you will like what I make.
- What I create will be just for you.
- It'll be done this year.
- You have no clue what it's going to be. It may be a mix tape. It may be fic, or a poem. I may draw or paint something. I might bake you something and mail it to you. Who knows? Not you, that's for sure!
- I reserve the right to do something extremely strange (you really should be worried at this point).

The catch? Oh, the catch is that you have to put this in your journal as well, if you expect me to do something for you!

You can <i>have</i> it, but I warn you it's the worst tea I've ever tasted. XD I heard licorice is supposed to be good for digestion, so I wanted to try it... And I like licorice, too. But I dunno, I just couldn't take it.

That said, you could like it. XD It's apparently one of their more popular teas."

So yesterday we went to see Metallica ;D It was KICKASS. I had a really good time. Except for maybe all the wandering around in the snow, but that was maybe fun.

I dunno why but sometimes I yell at people. It makes me sad.

For some reason we keep breaking things. XD Not like, having wild parties or wild sex or anything. Just dropping things out of cabinets, knocking over glasses, stepping on stuff... And we keep the place cleaner than any place we've had before!!! I don't understand it :(

Today I pulled on the toilet paper roll and the whole roll holder rod EXPLODED off the hook thing and flew into the toilet! I'm so freaked out, I HATE germs... XD Right now it's soaking in rubbing alcohol. Blegh."

"event","I think I've been doing a good job lately of being more upbeat, and getting more stuff done. I've actually done some cooking and some exercising and cleaning! ALL of those things, sometimes on the same day!!!! That's not to say I haven't had some bad, lazy days, or some sad and whiny days. XD But they're maybe a bit less.

Last week I went to this fancy bra shop (http://myintimacy.com) recommended by Oprah and shit. I dunno. I had to try it, anyway. Most of you probably know I have some, er, issues with my...bust ;D So I thought it couldn't hurt to try these fancy bras and the ""innovative fitting"" or whatever. When you go there, you go into the room with your helper lady thing, and you TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT which is kind of mortifying, and they LOOK at your BOOBS and just decide what size you are instead of using a tape measure or anything. Then they bring you bras to try on, and they help you into them. Yeah, into them. Like squish your boobs in and stuff. XD I wasn't *as* horrified as I thought I would be, but I was pretty embarrassed. In the end, I was really amazed with the results. No padding or anything! I ended up spending $179 for two bras. X__X BUT I gained like a million dollars in confidence, without needing surgery XD I even wore a low-cut shirt! Out! To a bar! I've had boobs for, what, more than ten years now. XD But I haven't been even a little comfortable with them till now. :)

In other news, today Steve and I bought tickets and made hotel reservations for our anniversary! We're going to San Diego. :) I'm SO excited! I want to go right now. XD We're definitely going to see the zoo, and DEFINITELY going to this place: http://smashshack.com because I feel like I need to make a pilgrimage there or something. XD I dunno, all my life I've really wanted to just go in a room and break things. I've commented many times while watching movies ""it must have been so much fun to film that scene and break all that stuff"". I *need* to do this, and I think it'll be a wicked good time. XD Also the hotel rents out bicycles and there are apparently bus tours to Tijuana. Maybe we'll take a short jaunt to Mexico! :D I really want to buy a guidebook, but I should probably stifle that...bahahaha...

Oh, also I dyed over the pink, and now I'm ""intense auburn"", which is more natural and also more classy. XD Actually when I got dressed to go out yesterday I felt like I was cosplaying as Mary Jane Watson. XD Except, of course, like a hundred pounds heavier X_____X"

"event","I never posted about this, so I figured I would now. When we came home after New Year's, we'd reserved a rental car with Enterprise. So Steve goes to pick up the rental car, in the snow, on Dec 31, because they're not open on Jan 1. When he gets there, they say ""oh, you're dropping it off in Boston? There's a $1/mile restocking fee"" and we're like whaaaaat because it's like 200 miles. So we say no thanks we'll find a different car. And I try to call other rental car places. I called one and the guy said they were going home because of the snow. Another one, like 40 minutes away, was open for another two hours. So Steve went down there to get a car from them. They said we could drive it to Boston, but we couldn't return it to the place nearest to our house because they were closed on Jan 1. Also we couldn't pick it up on Jan 1 because they were closed. We told them we'd be returning it at night on Jan 1 and they said that was okay, but we had to return it to the airport because it was the only place open.

So we drive back to Boston and I'm pissy for some reason or other and we have to drive to the airport rental car place to return it even though my mom's only going to be in Boston for like 12 hours because she's leaving the next day. When we return it, they charge us for TWO days, even though the original guy said it would be okay, and we're like wtf because if we were getting charged two days anyway we wouldn't have wasted the two fucking hours to go to the airport, we would've just kept it and returned it close to our place. And Steve had called earlier, even, to ask how much it would be to return it the next day near our place so we wouldn't have to drive all that way, and they said $200 (extra day). So even though we were ""supposed to have returned it by noon"", they were only charging us $100 at 7PM, but $200 at 9PM. It was seriously fucked. And the lady was totally unhelpful and was like ""oh it's not our contract, so we can't adjust it"" blah blah blah. And made us pay for it anyway and I threw a fit and everyone was mad at me. XD Actually I acted pretty badly...probably stress and low blood sugar. Anyway then we had to take the fucking bus to the fucking blue line to the fucking green line. When we got to the subway, I went to pull out my little card wallet thingie that had my subway card in, but it wasn't there. I took everything out of my purse, and it was gone. It might've been okay if I still got a monthly pass (because it was a new month and we hadn't got them yet) but I'd put money on it, like $50. So I had to buy a stupid ticket and then we missed the train that was coming and had to wait in the cold forever.

Actually this still makes me mad thinking about it ;D

Anyway eventually Steve yelled at the car people and they gave us a refund for the second day. And I called a million lost and found offices and eventually LaGuardia airport had my card wallet thing so they sent it back to me. Now I guess things are relatively back to normal, as long as we don't travel anymore ;D"

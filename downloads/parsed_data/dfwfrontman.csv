You all have been through a lot.  And I have unfortunately missed most of it.  But, things have never been more beautiful and confusing.  I am waiting anxiously for school to start again, and I hope you all are, too.  I have found myself a little more this summer, and I have been blessed to have been given the chances I have.  Finding joy in the oldest friends, this has been a wonderful few months.  For all of you - peace.

Oh, and Danny - Congratulations on the amazing job.  Good luck with that, but don't forget to catch up sometime."

Anyoldhoo, for all of you complaining about the cold, I wish it would snow like we lived under the rule of the ice queen in Narnia, and for those of you with snow, bring some home for me, okay?

Peace out, bitches."

Look kids - for anyone who might give a shit, I would love to see all (or at least most of) your ugly faces while I am home for a grand total of about 11 days.  I know most of you don't care, but I would love to see you, and I would love to do something fun with all of you.  Maybe it won't work out, but maybe it can.

ghost town (not some prize)

And the rain stops
this wasteland feels more like home
these colors unknown
all mankind is at the door

its not meant to be over your head
my brittle hands comfort you
still covering this newborn's heart

Within temptation
I am dismayed
hey baby put me up against the wall
I just won't turn on you

Intending on forever
I put the ice against your back
next and now or never
I'm useful, forever I am yours

I am sorry, but has the world gone mad?  Where is the intense humanity that I needed to feel for all the people I know and love?  No, fuck that.  Where are all the people I know and love?  I am not lost in this madness, but I fear the worst for you all.  Every one of you knows the way to my heart, but will you choose to come and claim it?  I hold no hope or doubt, as my head is no longer able to keep pace with my heart.  But, try as I might, this anxiety will best me long before my dream comes true, and long before I could ever say to you the truth I hold inside.  Don't care.  Why should you.  You all think the same of me.  I am spoiled with this ability to walk with my head up.  To show you what I am is not to change you, but to move you to change.

I couldn't pee for about five hours, and what little would come out when I tried, felt like a red hot poker being shoved up my urethra and twisted around a bit, just to make sure I was aware of a problem.  But, it's all good now.  I am peeing every few minutes, and still not feeling like I am on drugs.  What a waste of pain medication.  Sorry if this is whiny.  I am just unable to sleep, and really wanting to just get messed up and pass out from the pills they gave me.  Which don't freakin' work!!!"

"event","So, yesterday was disheartening, and let me tell you, that is the last thing I need right now.  Some of you may know that I haven't really been around the last few days, and some of you may not have noticed or given two shits.  I don't get to see my girlfriend for three weeks starting on Saturday, which will be the first day I wake up on drugs after my surgery on Friday.  I am not happy or excited about this.  So, if you want to see me acting more stupid than normal, come see me after Friday night.  I will be on the couch for a few days.  

Also, we have yet to hear back from our producer/friend Jeff, and when we went to talk to the other guy yesterday, he wasn't even there, and we had to talk to some half retarded excuse for a sound engineer instead.  Again, I don't think disheartened was the best turn I could've taken.  

But, my Mom called me this morning to wish me a happy 4th of July, and I got to tell her all about how much fun I had at my birthday party, and I guess I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who showed up.  I really appreciate you all so very much.  I wish I could have seen you all gettin' ""to'up"" at Glyn's the past few nights, but I am seriously obsessed with this girl.  I love you all, and I hope to see you soon.  Peace."

It was a good show, and I really feel bad for the people who came down and couldn't even get on the damn street because of the ridiculous curfew enforcement crap.  What a crock of shit.  Anyway, thank you so much for your effort.  If anyone actually came down and wasn't able to get on the street, let me know.  I am really sorry about that, and again, thanks for trying.  But, it was an awesome night, and I am glad we got to rock out with Gunderson again!  They rock my face.  Matt - You are the number one cowbell player, ever.  Much better that Gene Frenkle.  Don't you ever forget that.  Thanks again guys.  Peace."

"event","Mrs. Botchagalupe comes to visit her son Anthony for dinner. Anthony lives with a female roommate, Maria.  During the course of the meal, Mama can't help but notice how pretty Anthony's roommate is.  

She had long been suspicious of the relationship between the two, and this made her more curious.  

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Anthony and his roommate than meets the eye.

Reading his Mom's thoughts, Anthony volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Mama, Maria and I are just roommates.""

About a week later, Maria came to Anthony saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver sugar bowl. You don't suppose she took it, do you?""

""Well, I doubt it, but I'll e-mail her, just to be sure.""

So he sends his Mom an email:

Dearest Mama,

I'm not saying that you took the sugar bowl from my house, and I'm not saying that you didn't take it, I'm just saying that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Love,
Anthony

Several days later, Anthony receives an email response from his Mama:

Figlio mio,

I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Maria, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with her. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the sugar bowl by now.
Love, Mama

MORAL: Never lie to your Mother

"event","Well, tonight was fun.  I had a great time, we played a good show, and I think that we will be able to record the rest of our songs sooner than we had previously thought.  I don't know for sure, but I think recording our songs made us a more cohesive unit.  We just seemed more together tonight than a lot of other times.  Drew made me start thinking about track listings for our cd, and it is crazy.  I can't even start to think about what order our songs should go in.  I had been thinking about the whole process, and me and Aaron talked about it a little, but I'll be damned if I don't feel like I am doing something that really gives me a sense of accomplishment.  Hearing your own music on a cd, and having it sound good is an incredible thing.  I have never felt better about my situation musically as I do right now.  Rock the fuck out.


My first try at a track listing:
 1. You Need Me
 2. Come Clean
 3. Breakup #2
 4. Julia Moore (You're A Crazy, Mixed-Up, Mormon Girl, Who Doesn't Know She Could Rule The World)
 5. Making Out In The Front Seat
 6. Drop Dead, Gorgeous (The Dropped-D Song)
 7. Smoke
 8. Jane Says
 9. Eyes Like A Wishing Well
10. Help Me, I'm Helpless
11. Spinning
BT. Knickers

I don't know, but I am really tired, so this might be complete nonsense.  Okay, bye now."

My life's rhythm is enough to make me crazy, but without the sounds of insanity constantly bombarding me, I would feel as though I was floating listlessly through a sea of angry words in my mind.

"event","So, I really love to break people's hearts.  In other news, I made a girl that I was interviewing for an R.A. job cry.  In the interview.  With my boss watching me.  It was grand.  I couldn't believe my eyes when her tears started falling.  I wanted to laugh at her, tell her to buck the fuck up, and get over her foolish emotion.  Then I realized my heart is gone.  I am a bastard of almost epic proportion.  I really have pretty much no patience for people getting emotional on me any more.  I mean, if we are friends, I am more than willing to listen to what is bothering you, and I am certainly willing to help you out, but the second you start crying about something that seems dumb to me, I want to just laugh in your fucking face and tell you to quit being so pathetic.  I am seriously pondering what stole the last slivers of my heart.

I got to talk to my brother the other night, and I am so pumped about going to the Virgin Islands for spring break this year.  Drew is coming with me, so it is going to be fucking crazy, and I really just can't fucking wait.  I have said the fuck word a lot in this post.  Maybe it is all part of me turning over this new heartless leaf.  Anyway, I talked to my brother, and he has some awesome shit planned for us.  He wants to teach me to surf, or at least get me out on a board while I am down there, snorkeling, scuba diving, drinking, cliff diving, sailing, drinking, and just a shit ton of great stuff!  I can not wait.  Oh yeah, and Tip Your Waitress is going to Florida the end of February to play a show at Embry-Riddle.  For a fucking chili cook-off.  That is fucking crazy.  I am so pumped about the band right now.  Jordan, your Dad hasn't gotten back to me yet.  I am kinda deflated about it right now.  Any shit, Danny is coming soon, and he is missing two of our shows by like a day a piece, so he sucks, but it'll be fun anyway.  Two 'Hawks are better than one.  Peace out, ya'll.

So, basically, I am mad at you Paul, but if I were in your shoes, I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing.  But, we should be able to find a decent replacement in a day.  But you still suck ass.  We need to talk.  Have a good time in South Bend."

I want to write a song that everyone in the entire world will hear and like, if only a little bit.

I don't like your subconscious; or at least what it has been telling you.

I want to run through the hills that have forgotten their worth,

I want to hold out for something just a little bit better.

I want to pull out right before it all comes crashing down.

I want so much so bad.

I want you one more time, and then again, and again, and again, and again.

I need you on my side, so please don't ever turn your back on that need."

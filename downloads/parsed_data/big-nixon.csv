"event","I'm baking marble cheesecake brownies for a bake sale, and I'm not going to Iron and Wine tonight. Though I'd love to <i>have</i> seen them, and I actually planned to, the entire process of actually doing so seems very laborious. And right now, the mess of twigs bouncing outside the window holds as much beauty as I could ever want. Not that the branches themselves are so beautiful and not to say all of the beauty belongs to these branches, but rather there is a Great Beauty they remind me of because of where their beauty finds its Source. Maybe in serving as a reminder they give me hope for that Beauty. Sometimes they're just branches. Sometimes it's given to me that I should witness them as I do now. The beauty neither comes from my own eyes nor from the branches solely, but is a combination of circumstances, and regardless of what one determines ""circumstance"" (or ""Circumstance"") to mean, this whole scenario has little to do with me. Sometimes I feel sad and lonely 'cause I've prepared myself to recieve sad and lonely, but sometimes even if I'm prepared for them it's like they aren't there. Sometimes I've prepared myself to recieve joy and beauty to a small extent, and when either are around, however rarely that might be, their experience far exceeds any experience of happiness, fun, excitement, leisure, pleasure that I go out and take for myself. Sometimes it turns out that pleasure is a very painful thing. I'm grateful for my small capacity to recieve, and my wonder at what can be recieved is inexpressible. Tonight, I'm fine at home, and I think I'll stay here."

My whole past has become very very distant. I really can remember far less than I was able to six months ago. It's sort of nice having shifted my focus to nothing but the present (as often as I can I focus on nothing else, at least). Of course, anxiety still seems to be wringing out the contents of my stomach on a daily basis anyway, but at least I can fight it.

Last Saturday we did a three-year memorial service for my friend Kyle with just my mother, my brother Joel, and I, with my father leading the service, and my mother. It was such a pretty service, and sorrowful. Then on Wednesday I went and visited Kyle's grave in Twin Falls, ID with my parents. Ever since I visited the monastery things have been a lot clearer. And I'm doing far less to distract myself now."

Anyways, so I get home at 4:00AM this morning after a wonderful time at the Cretcher residence. I get to sleep around 4:30. Some point in the morning, beginning to reach consciousness in my bowl chair thingy, I feel a tickle on my arm, and, due to the location of the tickle, I begin to wonder if my eyelashes are rubbing against my arm. I test my theory by moving my head a little, but the tickle seems inconsistent with my own movement. I open my eyes, and there's this big ol' shiny black spider on my arm, and its legs are extra pointy like tiny daggers, and half a second later I'm on the other side of the room and the spider is gone. Damn I can get up fast when I'm freaked out. I still don't know where the spider is, though."

"event","So my former Cisco (computer networking) class has taken a bit of a turn, and now, instead of learning how to network computers, I'm learning how to play midi files such as lowrider and adding my own sounds, with the help of various soundboards across the internet. My most recent work involved a midi of ""my sharona"" and a bill lumbergh of office space soundboard. Expect to see it on shelves sometime soon. It's hot."

"event","I liked this place I just went to. I sat and listened and watched and had tea. it was perfect just having company there. and then I took the long drive home and got out to the lonely streets so I could listen to my best favorite band on my headphones. and drove sorta fast. then no gas pedal on my street. i should go there more often, with or without a friend. I should talk to the biker guys. but the drive down my street was sort of surreal. it was good."

"event","So last night I went to Main Street and did karaoke. I was pretty sober by my turn to sing, and I sang Come On Eileen (poorly, I thought) but everyone seemed to like it. I took my little boy coat off in the process, and sort of spazzed. Then some guy came up to me and asked me if I got laid all the time. Due to my response, his friend lost a bet. I can't wait to perform with my band."

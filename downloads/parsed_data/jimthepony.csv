Oh. Hi. I do have this place. Yes. Lovely.

:ahem:

I have been the laziest little shit lately. This entire semester has just been one massive nothingfest. And while it is enjoyable, it gets tiresome after a while. Trying to fix that. Might even have gotten a respectable job, ties and black socks and all, had I not been thwarted at every turn by a wretched mixture of bureaucracy and shoddy job sites.

Still having that sleeping problem. Five hours, and I'm woozy, as to be expected. Eight hours, and I feel like I've been smashed in the face with a brick. Unexpected. Not to mention this goddamn house is hotter than Satan's piss.

Getting a little better on the 'improving myself' bit. Found my black book again, so now I have an idea as to what's going to happen to me in a wider timeframe than the next thirty minutes, which is comforting.

Relationships are just not working out. 

Friends are totally working out. Maybe Drew was right, that I'm on the asexual side of bisexuality. But, then again, being ""asexual"" to Drew is ""not constantly commenting on how much I'd like to poke my fling du jour"". 

That's not fair to him. But it sounded good.

If I'm sounding odd, blame Abby. She let me borrow Transmetropolitan, which is a superb kick in the ass.

You are now looking at the President of the George Mason University Anime Club. Now I just have to rig the election to make it official. And not become enraged and slug the band of misanthropes that I am now president of.

I think I'll do something good for me today."

"event","Dunno who to talk about this to at the moment, so I'll just throw it all out here.

I don't know what it is that I've been feeling for the last few days, but I guess the closest thing I can think of us that I have been utterly desireless when it comes to others. I've lived, largely isolated, desiring no help from and little contact with others. I've also been very self-obsessed and working hard toward my own measure of improvement.

I've gotten this way before- I guess I've been alone for so long that there are times when others choke me (especially on this cramped little campus) and I just want to go back to being alone. And other than one thing, I know I'll do okay. It's not depression or anything, just a state of mind that I get into sometimes that will probably leave in a little while. And there will come a time when I desire again. So I'm not too worried.

But then there's that one thing. I'm in a relationship now, and that's what's been driving me absolutely up the wall. This lack of desire only started after I fucked up our last date, and it's stayed stronger and fresher than any time I've felt in a long time. So I'm wondering if this is some sort of trick my brain is playing on me, my cold, weak side trying to get me to sabotage a good, working relationship. And the last thing I want to do is to hurt him, but I keep hearing something scream at me to run away and protect myself at the cost of all others.

Whatever it is, I want it dead. For the past couple of years I've been trying to burn it away, slough it off, so that I can work at being a better person. But now I'm worried that what it is will be there, hiding just below a thin layer of what I imagine myself to be, ready to leap out and mentally return me to a childhood and an adolescence I honestly don't care to return to.

I haven't cried in months. Maybe more than a year now. I wonder if that's the problem."

I'll admit it- I didn't pay full attention to this episode, especially when most of it consisted of some very long speeches. Ichigo's speech did illuminate Kariya a little, so now I can probably put him to rest and never think about him again.

And it was kind of fun to see Rukia's and Renji's reactions to their assignments from shortly before the first chapter started. It was the only really well-written part of the whole filler arc, and that doesn't even count since it drew inspiration from the canon storyline.

But hark! Squee! Ave, Claude! You were the only Bount I liked whose death wasn't mandated by the plot, and you got to live! Sure, it's a lonely, tortured existence with your creator, but you were never particularly mad at her anyway.

<lj-cut text=""However, this is my journal and we do things my way. D:"">

Warning: This is going to get a bit negative. Not Dr. David Thorpe negative, but then again I'm not dipping into Something Awful's vault of 10bux as a result of my services.

So. It's over. I believe it clocked in at 44 episodes, from 64 to 108, slightly shorter than the Soul Society arc if you started it from when Renji and Byakuya arrested Rukia, which I do. It bought Kubo Tite approximately one year to do his thang, so we'll see what happens in nine months when the anime catches up again. >.O

(In retrospect, I can see why the Naruto fillers were so fucking long, since Naruto's now guaranteed at least a hundred episodes of uninterrupted ninjary. I might have to actually pick that one up again.)

Kariya just didn't work for me. Up until fifteen minutes ago, he didn't even make sense, until his whole ""I'm not crazy, everybody else is"" speech about halfway through the episode, and then Ichigo's incredibly dull, anticlimactic ""Oh, he was probably just suicidal"" speech at the end. If Ichigo was right, and he just wanted his eternal life to end, why the hell would he have gone and gotten the other Bount killed? Koga, especially, seemed to want to live, and didn't seem to care so much for the injustices the shinigami had wrought on them. Why did he have to die? I dunno. Maybe I just like Koga.

Not only did Masser have wind power, he had lightning power too?! Laaaaame.

I would always groan when Ichigo stepped up to the plate because his battles got very formulaic. There'd be some banter, a few clashes, both of them getting pissed, both of them raising the stakes, more banter, bad guy gaining a temporary upper hand, Hollow-Ichigo stepping in for a moment, more stakes-raising, more banter, some utterly terrible dialog, the final raising of stakes, and then the Traditional Samurai Running At Each Other Bit. He could not have done that less than three times during this arc.

At least he didn't pull any new moves out of his ass this time.

Seriously, though. Ishida should have struck the final blow, and then made off with Rantao to her Secret Island Hideaway. She could do without those robes though. They made her look stuffy. Totally unlike that jacket/tight-pants combo Yoshino was wearing. Rrrrow.

Speaking of Rantao (sorry, that apostrophe/capitalized secondary syllable bit was bugging the crap out of me), there must have been at least three dei ex machinae in that episode alone. Maybe I'm casting that definition too wide, but it also feels like the writers were trying to rush the ending. As if that were possible.

Rukia, to my horror, did not fulfill her googly eye quota, but instead switched over to pointless cheerleading and repeatedly explaining why she and Renji didn't go in there and bash Kariya's head in.

ARGH. This is the second time we got to see Choujiro in 40-some-odd episodes, Ichigo's not upstaging him this time, and HE DOESN'T GET A FRIGGIN' LINE.

I did really like that one line Rukia said, about how Ichigo had been caught between human and Shinigami. That hadn't been explored enough in the manga, I don't think, and it's going to get especially interesting once he deals with his hollow self as well.

I think that's enough for now. </lj-cut>"

So... yeah. Where the fuck did Ichinose come from? I guess Zaraki's been slacking off lately. I have, however, developed a grudging respect for him now that he's no longer so hideously misguided.

While it would be awesome to see Rukia go out on a tear with Sode no Shirayuki, it kind of is an important plot point for the next arc and I doubt they would show it already, so this is probably going to end up being another ""Rukia makes googly eyes at Ichigo"" encounter. (FUN FACT: While looking up Shirayuki's name, I discovered that ""Rukia"" is also a genus in the Zosteropidae (white-eyed songbird) family. Go taxonomy!)

Masser looks totally badass. If Kariya had brought him out twenty episodes ago, that fight against Byakuya and Ichigo wouldn't have looked so cheesy.

Anticlimax, n.- When they disable all the Joukaishou and Kariya blows himself up and nothing happens.

Last semester, I took English 302B, the B standing for business. That was one of the most fulfilling classes I've ever taken. I got to learn how to write in the manner of a professional contributor to academic journals, somebody who studies the means by which business is carried out. I was one of the top five, if not the best, writer out of my 120 classmates. Had I not forgotten to give my permission to my professor, she would be using my essays as an example to future students on how to write a good essay. I could explore my craft. I could have fun.

But, unfortunately, that had to go, so I got into the next class up- SOM 301. Now, this is the gateway class into the real heavy stuff, the starting point for the last last year and a half of business training. So I was expecting it to be focused on how each part of a business works, and how each of those parts work together to form the whole corporation. And I was right. Partway. The lecture's like that.

So I walk into lab.

First lesson, I am told that all my writing has to be bound to an absurdly cropped set of limitations. Your sentences must be as concise as possible. No tones but ""obsequious"" (toward superiors) and ""completely detached"" (toward inferiors). No flourishes. No turns of phrase. No idioms. No subtlety. No slang. No jargon. No color. No flavor. No way no how. And for the Love of God, I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING THAT HAS EVEN A 1% CHANCE OF OFFENDING ANYBODY OMG.

So, yeah. This time last year I was writing about positive and negative effects of globalization. This time this year, I'm learning how to puff myself up on a sheet of paper so that a business doesn't have to take the trouble of interviewing me to see how I would actually, you know, fit into their system. I had previously assumed ""Management"" meant ""general guidelines for working above and below people in a business"", not fucking ""Etiquette, lol :D"".

Not that this crap isn't going to be useful someday. I just hate this sort of thinking."

I was in Decision Sciences lecture, which is approximately 130 minutes long, attended by at least 250 other students, in a heavily air-conditioned lecture hall, and, to top it all off, not terribly interesting. It was the first class ever in which I fell asleep. No joke.

In a (surprisingly successful) bid to keep myself both awake and focused, I brought along a bottle of water to drink at intervals. I'd take a swig when I was flagging, and suddenly felt better, more in tune with what the professor was saying.

And then, for no reason at all except that I had taken my fourth swig of water, I wanted a cock. Just right then and there, in my mouth, in the pooper, in my hand, somewhere, anywhere. I had all the symptoms of an intense arousal. And then, perhaps two or three minutes after I set down the water bottle, I went back to normal.

I waited about another ten minutes, and then took another mouthful. BAM. It all came rushing back- the desire for a male partner, the need to feel satisfied, heat, discomfort, squirmyness, all of the other common symptoms. And again, soon after I set the bottle down, it all went away.

Great Wall was fun, even though I'm one of the few people who can say they threw up on it. :D I also saw a bunch of dancer lolis pissing on it, which freaked me the hell out. Note to self- the overpriced Coke that you buy from the creepy old toothless man at the foot of the Wall is the reward for getting <i>down</i> the Wall, not the burst of energy you need to get <i>up</i>. Not much else on the China front, though we did go see a cute/stupid ""Kung Fu Master"" show.

I've been reading The Song of Ice and Fire lately. Got the first book for Christmas, finished it in two days, grabbed the second book in Wangfujing, and collapsed into a giggling pile of fraternal love when I figured out that Arya hadn't in fact died. Danaerys seems like she'd be fun to draw.

Meh, I'll do the meme next time I get on the computer here in the library. That'll be in a few days. But you can still pick your title anyways."

Stephen King recommends something like three or four pages (which by my calculations is 750-1000 words). To make a NaNo, you have to maintain a 2000-word-a-day pace for 25 days. 

I'm finally learning how to do the latter.

I've been going to a park every day or every other day now, with a notebook and purple pen, and I've been able to just sit there with the CDs going for four hours and write. And I'm churning out 8 pages more and more frequently. I'd always wondered how to combat my perfectionist streak- the nagging bastard in the back of my head that makes me cross out and write something new every four or five words. It was one of the reasons I failed last time. Not the main reason, but if I can find a private place to write this time, I'll definitely be able to do this."

"event","Seriously. I'm about to burst into an <lj-cut text=""unquenchable ball of pure burning shame:"">

Have you ever been planning something out when suddenly, out of the blue, shortly before your point of no return, you get a big ominous voice telling you ""DON'T""? 

I had one earlier today, going down the Beijing Metro. I had gone to the Military Museum, laughed at the propaganda, saw some cool Three Kingdoms stuff, nearly got kicked out by the guards when the place closed, etc. I was pretty pleased. Not <i>totally</i> pleased, though, which meant I had to have another Otra-and-Winter-grade adventure. Hell, why not? I had a few hours left before I needed to go to bed, and I hadn't found a single comic book in all of Beijing. So I decide to go to Wangfujian and check out the stores.

Halfway to Xizhenmen, the transfer station that would have taken me back to Wudaokou and safety, I had that big ominous voice tell me ""DON'T"".

At this point, I was presented with a choice; the first one being that I could have gone back to Wudaokou and the university, kicked back a barley tea, played some Guild Wars, wrote a little, drew a little, had myself a good ole time. Normally, I might have chosen this. But I'm in Beijing. An Osaka-style fantasy pops in and kicks that big ominous voice to the curb. So Xizhenmen passes. A few more stops, and I'm at Wangfujian. I get off, and enter a mall. So far, I'm patting myself on the back for my adventurous spirit.

And then I met a girl.


...


I'm going to let that sink in for a moment.

She told me she was practicing her English, may she come with me? I said okay, lead the way. She led me to a teahouse way in the back of a women's fashion department. She asked the woman in charge for a nonsmoking room. The lady brought in a menu with teas. They looked expensive, but there were a few cheap ones (re: 60 to 80 kuai) on the back. I didn't know which one to pick, so I let her pick. She got us some excellent tea and two plates of fruit.

At this moment, I'm flying high. I'm sitting in Beijing with a pretty girl in an authentic teahouse sipping on tea and munching on watermelon and dragonfruit. This is literally the most fun I've had since I got here.

And then the bill came.

I was expecting two to three hundred kuai. I would have been happy with four or five hundred kuai.

The bill was <i>1200 fucking kuai</i>. That's $150. In addition to accidentally ordering the most expensive tea on the list (Y360) and the two plates of fruit (Y300), <i>the room cost money</i>. Naturally, she didn't have the money. I pulled out my debit card, and immediately cut my savings account in half.

She apologized for the mistake, and led me around Wangfujiang a little longer. We walk around, she led me into a department store, and into a second teahouse.

My brain immediately ground to a halt. ""Jim, what are you doing? You just spent $150 on fucking tea. Why are you following this crazy girl into the same goddamn trap?"" Honestly, I had no answer. I suspect it was CHINA MADNESS.

So we sat down. A lady came in and performed a traditional tea ceremony. Once again, my brain screamed its lungs out, but only into a void. We had twelve kinds of tea, all of them excellent, and some cookies. I wisely turned down the offer of tea to take home with me.

A lot of good that did me. The bill was <i><b>2300</b></i> kuai. For the folks at home, I had just spent $300 additional dollars on tea. I had spent $450 dollars on tea in the span of an hour and a half. I freaked out. I did not have enough money to pay the bill. After some frantic explaining, the girl removed the box of tea she had just ordered on my tab. The bill immediately dropped to 1500 kuai. I breathed slightly easier, but just slightly. I handed the lady my debit card again. To my complete and utter surprise, the purchase went through.

After that, I kind of lost interest in the world around me. I felt like a dork, her talking to me and me going ""Huh?"" every few seconds because all I could think about was that I had just spent $350 on tea.

And then she gave me a box of the tea I liked best out of the twelve. I noticed that she had pulled out several Y100 bills to pay for it. And then she offered to take me out to dinner and gave me her phone number. I felt a little better. Just a little.

So. An honest mistake? A subtle trap for stupid foreigners? An oblique pathway to acquiring a hot nerdy American date?

The only thing I can at the moment think is, I just went to the ATM to figure out how great the damage was. I had 13.90 kuai left in my account. </lj-cut>"

We've split into two groups; one consisting of partiers who range from meatheads to very social intellectuals, and a bunch of girls who err on the side of prim and whom I can't find the nerve to talk to. So I can't really make a common ground with anybody except for Lara, and I don't see her that often.

The thing that gets to me is that everybody gets disappointed in me when I'm not being social. I only like being social with people I <i>like</i>, and when your idea of a social gathering is to get stone drunk on cheap beer and then whine and bitch the next morning when you come to class late because you stumbled into your bed at four A.M. after fruitlessly trying to impress a bunch of girls who are as vapid and as unintersting as you are, I tend not to like you. So it's really, honestly not all that unusual for me to go to class, go somewhere fun/interesting, come back to the room, and then just play on the computer, or read, or draw.

But then I feel stupid. I feel some sort of weird pressure to join with people I hate who do things I can't stand, and then not talk to them because I have nothing to do with their conversations. I feel like crap beforehand, and then I feel like crap afterwards. I felt that way all the way during my first year at Mason, and I'm pissed off at myself for feeling so.

What the fuck was up with Star Wolf?

Seriously. In high school, while Peppy and Pigma were off saving the universe with James and creating doujin fodder, Wolf would have been taking kids' lunch money, Fox would have been liberating said money from Wolf, Leon would have been snickering in the background, Falco would have been punching Leon in the back of his stupid iguana head for no good reason, and Andrew and Slippy would have been... I dunno, sitting in bathroom stalls on the opposite sides of the school questioning their sexuality? Something like that. But the point is, Star Wolf was diametrically opposed to Star Fox. And they should have always been that way.

And now they're pseudo-good guys. And being <i>noble</i> and <i>self-sacrificing</i> and shit. No. This is not how you do Star Fox. Even if you're Namco.

The beginning started out fairly promising. You kill Andrew (who only thinks he's as cool as his father) right off the bat. Pigma gets lost in the far reaches of space and turns into a giant insect-pig-space-death machine in one of the only entertaining boss battles in the game. You kill him too. Star Wolf compensates by bringing in Panther, who immediately establishes himself as a perfectly excellent bad guy by attempting to sex up Fox's girlfriend. You have a decent but all-too-easy fight about a third of the way through the game.

Then everything turns to crap. They start being <i>nice</i>. They blow up shit <i>for</i> you. Wolf complements Fox in a <i>genial</i> manner, then lets Fox <i>get on the wing of his Wolfen and shoot targets down</i>. They <i>nearly sacrifice themselves taking down the Aparoid Queen's bodyguards so that you can get through</i>. There's an attempt to keep up with the ""we're <i>bad</i> dudes"" facade by being gruff, sneaky, and horny, but it sounds forced when you're blowing up missiles to save a space station that is certainly going to be hunting you down six months from now for your crimes against the Lylat system.

No. 

That is unacceptable. They're supposed to be the instigators. The fly in your ointment. The gatekeepers. The vixen-kidnappers, ruin-raiders, and planet-plunderers. Star Wolf is supposed to be composed of badasses who threaten your medal count, make you start the level over, get shot down, and still look good doing it.</lj-cut>

Unfortunately, having had a reset, I'm totally unsure of what I should be doing with my free time. I'd really like to start writing and drawing again, but I can't seem to even find the inspiration to sit down with a pad of paper. Maybe I need to be watching a bit more anime rather than playing video games and roaming 4chan.

*Note to self: look into developing a human reset button. Not only could I make a mint selling it to college students, it would be fuck awesome."

"event","Balargh. I've been writing something close to three essays a week lately... but I think it's all done now. One more assignment in BULE, that one big assignment in English, and something approaching four, five finals. Or something. I'll get back to you on that.

That's not why I'm here, though. I've noticed that a lot of what goes on in my journal is just random crap I throw on when I feel like it, and that I don't remember the last time I had a heart-to-heart with anybody. In fact, I don't think I've told a lot of the forthcoming stuff to anybody, so here goes. I'm broadcasting it to the Intarwebs, though for the most part, they don't care. In one way, that's a nice kind of therapy to me. 

Also be forwarned: You will see a lot of verbal vomit. It's 12:31 and I don't think I've had a coherent thought since two weeks ago.

I noticed that a lot of my friends had a lot of trouble adjusting to the college/being on your own experience. I won't tell you the details since A) If you are them or know them, you should know by now, and B) If you don't know them, it's probably none of your damn business and C) this journal is about me. Suffice it to say that there were a wide range of symptoms ranging from soul-searching to depression, and that different people suffered different things at different times. But none of that happened to me. I feel almost exactly as I did when I left for here eight months ago.

Sure, I'm lonely. But I don't think I've never been lonely. I didn't have friends until I was in the eighth grade. Even when I did have friends, I've had to leave them behind and hate myself for not keeping in contact with them. It's been eight months since I got here, and I've made a few acquaintances, but nobody whom I could call a friend other than Abby and Stephanie, and they were from before. I never get out, except to go to work, class, food, or Anime Club. I'm decently sure I'm not anti-social, since I start up conversations with people I've never met, and do it pretty well, but I can never be sure.

It's not like I'm not afraid of people, I just don't like most of them. I had to quit Gay Club because they were all too damn <i> social </i>. They were as chatty and as vapid a group of people as I've ever seen. This floor that I'm living on is filled with hicks, faux-gangsters, and snots whom I don't think I'll ever in a million years establish a dialogue. I'm afraid to turn on the J-pop or the dance music in my room and play it when I know other people are listening. I cringe whenever I put on some shoujo shows and I don't have my headphones on. Maybe I am afraid of people whom I'm not like. I dunno. I still talk to them when they talk to me, and I don't fumble with my words anymore and stutter like I used to. But I never start the conversation with them myself. I freak out, kind of, whenever I have to leave the room for a drink of water. I get very self-conscious when I'm not with somebody I know. It's weird.

I'm not happy. But I've never been happy, either. Maybe I was when I was a child, but I'm having a hard time remembering what I was like before the eighth grade. What I usually do remember from being a child was whenever I was terrified, frustrated, or some combination of the two, so I doubt I was happy even then. But I'm not unhappy. I don't pity myself, I don't hate myself, I don't hate people who don't deserve it. I don't go out of my way to self-destruct. In fact, in all ways, in all times, in all places, I'm trying to better myself in some way.

Is that the problem? I'm a perfectionist. I accept that. That feeling of feeling better than I did yesterday, feeling smarter, more skilled, what have you-- it's addictive, and I don't care what bad things happen to me as a result. I've got a thousand skills I want to acquire, as if I were some RPG character. Do I want to raise my skill set in Drawing or in Organization? Acquire the Cross-Hatching Feat at level 3? Is my Constitution high enough to pull this all-nighter (DC 23)? I fear that my constant need to quantify and qualify everything, to inspect everything at the minute details makes me lose perspective. 

I spent a year doing nothing but writing papers, and that's no way to live. I want a job that I like by the time I turn 30. That's 11 years away. I robbed myself a year. Did I need that year? Or should it have been for adjusting? I'm so insecure, so self-defeating with this sort of planning thing, that I fear that I'm not going to ever make any progress, that I'm going to sit at my computer forever, gain fifty pounds, and do nothing but homework and hang out on Gaia and 4chan all day. And that scares the hell out of me.

I wasn't sure where to put this, but there are a few things that have defined me so far. I don't hate my family. Not even my father, who essentially didn't exist at all for me as anything but an instrument of fear. He ruthlessly observed everything I did while he was here, and whenever he wasn't, I became accustomed to relaxing that strict set of discipline he forced me into. I don't love any of them, either. I just feel like they're not there. Like, they're people I've known my entire life, but I don't find a point in associating with them any more. I want to cut them off at some point and never speak to them again. I want my only family to consist of one big sister and three little sisters, because those are the only people in the world I have any love for.

I'm an atheist. There is no life after death for me. I will become a lump of lifeless carbon, proteins, and water when I die. My personality will be gone forever. And that terrifies me more than anything in the world. I want to leave some mark, which is why I strive to perfect myself so much. I don't want to be remembered for nothing.

I want to sleep, at least. I haven't had a good night's sleep in God knows how long. 

If you paid attention thus far, thank you, I'm not entirely sure how much of that made any sense to anybody but me."

However, I would like to curse my Senpai a little for leading me on a long, dark path. And on this long, dark path, I have acquired an insatiable lust for dance/pop that far exceeds my lust for anything else but pork ribs. I swear I've had Madonna on loop for the last two hours today, and The Petshop Boys for three, four hours last Wednesday. XD;;

"event","I really need to start up some sort of long-term planning type thing. I had a week to do my essay on management and I finished it literally 26 minutes before class started. And don't get me started on starting it at 10:15 last night.

Other than schoolwork, I've kind of been dead to the world. Utterly crapped out on my Macro midterm (68), surprisingly miserable on my BULE midterm (expecting a low C and the scorn of my lawyer-professor), and surprisingly well on Micro (a mid-B at worst). This is the last semester I try to balance a work schedule and an academic career, because school is only going to get harder from this point on.

At least I get 10 days to rest. Somewhere in the back of my head, I keep hearing ""YOU NEED MORE VESPENE GAS"" or somesuch nonsense.

It's really starting to bug me. I keep wanting to improve, and I try really damn hard, but I fall off the wagon after only a few weeks. I did well at the beginning of the semester, really well. I kept things clean, and I was able to keep things moving at the right speed. But, lately though... it's all kind of fallen apart. I can't seem to plan ahead, I can't seem to get anything I want to do done because I have all of this interfering crap that I don't know where it's coming from. My head still feels like it's in a vise, my neck is worse than before, and I feel like last night was the first time in a really long time I got a real good night's sleep.

I guess I'll just clean my room and sleep on it."

In other news- Meh. I've kind of been drifting away from Gay Club... I'm starting to get the feeling that they're too active and social for my tastes. Free time has largely been nonexistant, and will become moreso as I get closer to midterms (which are two weeks away! Shock!). Not to mention all of the stupid essays I've been having to write.

"event","SUVs suck.  That's just a fact.  When I see one driving on the street, I immediately assume the person driving it is an asshole.  Now, that's ridiculous...I'm friends with several people who drive SUVs, and they're not assholes.  However, there's something significant in my reaction to them and my judgment of the drivers, which I promise is not my typical reaction to people at all.

There's something even more frightening than a big ugly SUV driving down the road, though.  Big uglier SUVs driving down the road.  This first occurred to me when I saw an Aztek.  I had to look twice.  ""Nobody,"" I thought, ""nobody could possibly let themselves drive that.""  But there it was, dormant in a grocery store parking lot, its hideousness only exacerbated by its absurd size.  It looked like the cars from heavily pixelated NES offroad racing games (would you believe that dictionary.com has no word like ""pixelated""?).  But I went on in my life, somehow, blocking the thought that Azteks continue to sell.  Then something happened that shook my worldview forever.  I saw a Honda Element.  Like most rational people, I was speechless.  Some sort of gargantuan box seemed to have found its way onto a set of tires and had plunged onto the road way, or so I hoped.  No reputable car company would make an armored car designed by a three year old.  But it was a car, and it had been made.  Even more surprising was the fact that TONS OF PEOPLE BOUGHT ONE!

So...I was prepared to try to go on with my life again, and just ignore the matter.  But the trend continues.  Advertisements for the Toyota Scion have infiltrated the commercial breaks.  People...I mean this as seriously as I can possible say it: the only thing stupider than an Element IS AN ELEMENT KNOCK-OFF!  Jesus...I mean...Jesus..."

"event","The situation in the Middle East is always really bad, and it's been getting a lot worse, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Now, I don't presume to know the answer to any of this whole spiel...I don't even know if there is an answer.  There is, however, one thing we can do that will make it a teensy bit better.

We need Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, Powell, Rumsfeld, and all other relevant American politicians together (the Senate, the House, etc.), as well as all journalists who ever write about the Middle East, terrorism, or any related topic.  We'll rent out a convention center or something.  So we get everyone together, and then we bring along some people from the Middle East who are fluent in Arabic and English.  And we all sit down together.  And we go ""Okay, so...how are we going to pronounce 'Al-qaeda'?""  And some people will say al-KAY-duh and others will say al-KIE-duh, and the Arabic speakers will put in their two cents, and we'll come to a conclusion.  Then we'll move on to ""So..how are we going to say 'Iraq'?""  And some will say eye-RAK and others will say ih-ROK, and we'll figure it out.  And we'll do this with everything...Kabul, Muqtada al-Sadr, the infamous SOD-dum/suh-DOM Hussein issue.

It's bad enough that we don't seem to know what we're doing over there.  We could at least pronounce what we're fucking up correctly."

"event","Listen, people.  You're not cutting it.  I'm a patient guy, and you're just not getting much better.  So I've decided to help you out.  It's not that I think I'm a genius, or even think I'm all that smart, and I certainly don't think that I'm smarter than you...HOWEVER, you do not seem to be actively making an effort to get better.  So take this as a favor.  Let's start off with something simple.


One day, somebody halfway-intelligent will develop remote controls for televisions.  At this point in time, a remote control will be given a little sounder device inside that allows you to push a button (strategically placed on the television itself) and have the remote control go ""Beep!  Beep!  Beep!"" until you find it.  This isn't even an original idea, guys...the cordless phone people figured this out right away.  So...get on that."

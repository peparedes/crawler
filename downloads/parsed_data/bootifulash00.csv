"event","ohhhh wow..... last night was quite eventful lol. I'll fill you in.

So chelsea spent the night.  We decided we would sneak out because its pretty much the only way we get to do anything anymore.  Luis called us and he was at a party so we decided thats where we would sneak out to.  It took us fuckin 45 mintues to sneak out bc we were really paranoid and shit bc my parents are really suspicious now.  We snuck out the window well in my basement and all of ryans little friends were down there like helping us and shit it was awesome.  So we got out and I think I got some form of temporary frostbite trying to go really slow and be quiet in the snow.  We left footprints in the snow (but we attepted to cover them when we snuck back in even tho we were intoxicated). We finally get to chelsea's car and drive out and get to ben's house, and we go inside and theres a shit ton of dark eyes vodka... gag me.  But when you wanna get trashed, you have to compromise.  So me and chels ended up having like, 4 or 5 shots each and we were feelin pretty good.  I had to drive home cuz by the time we had to leave she was like, gone.  Ben and jacob got taco bell.  I think ben shit his pants, at least thats what iszidro yelled when we were gettin ready to leave. I was to drunk to care.  He kept asking people if they wanted to get into a hard titty sword fight lol.  He was like GODDD i cant beleive i got my nipple hard for nothing! it was hilarious.  Some other events also occured that I dont really feel like mentioning that were pretty funny too.  We snuck back in and we were REALLLLLY  loud, well i correct myself, chelsea was really loud cuz she was fuckin drunk off her ass, but I was sobered up.  But anyway we snuck back in and just passed out on ryans bed, without the parents ever knowing.  We are so crafty!  So that was our night.  See, me and chelsea are so fun, next time you wanna do somethin, give us a call we will show you how to partay!!! im gonna eat.  Loves you!"

"event","So I had to work this afternoon, and I got in there and I saw Breaunna was gonna be working on the sheet that tells you.  About 5 min. later someone calls in and tells johnny they are gonna be late.  Johnny fights with them on the phone for about 15 minutes and he gets off the phone and he says ""Hey ash you can cross breaunna's name off the list she wont be working with us anymore."" ohhhh my goddddd it was one of the happiest moments of my life that I can currently remember.  It was beautiful.  

Drivin home wasnt bad but some ppl got in a wreck like right in front of me.  It was kinda cool but they were pissed... obviously.  

I think I'm spendin the night at Chelsea's tonight... we have a nice fun little plan conjured up:) lol wow that was a pretty big word for me, Im doin better.  Anywho... I'm doin paint on here and its quite fun... let me know if you want me to make you a picture:).  Love yous!"

"event","Wellllll today pretty much sucked because it was normal... just like every other day.  The highlight of my day was goin to B dubs 2 night... I got wings and chips and salsa baby, hell yeah.  The downside you ask? Wellll it was one of my many FAMILY trips to b-dubs. Omg I know.

So as many of you know I recently got in HUGE trouble because the parents found out how I like go out and drink every weekend and spend the night somewhere else than where I say I'm goin... well that is why I am posting at 8:30 on a friday night.  Am I grounded you ask? No.  I'm just not allowed to do ne thing I want, so I might as well be grounded. Mother Fucker.

I have nothing else to say."

I had to work 2 night.  It wasnt bad at all, I got to coordinate and shit like that.  I had to miss the Christmas Party  monday tho... everyone was talking about it and I felt left out.

I'm not goin to Indy this weekend anymore, I couldnt get off work:( oh well, looks like g-ma has to come stay with me now b/c my parents trust me about 3 shits worth so yeah... that'll be fun.

"event","Hey guys... I decided to start doin this thingy again... bascially because I have nothing better to do.

The dance was last night, I decided not to go at about 6.  Dustin came over:).  We watched Napolean Dynamite... that movie is soooo hilarious.  I'll probably buy it. 

There was WAYYYYY to much unecissary (I have no idea how to spell that word) drama last night.  I got a call from Chels with some news that I wont mention on here, pretty much b/c its none of your business lol.  But Chelsea I love you and everything is gonna work out hun:).  I wish I could tell you something to make you feel better but I can't so I'll just say what you already know... Im here for ya and I love you.

On Friday night I had to work with Breaunna :(... I should soooo start a ""Breaunna's a bitch"" club.  There would be quite a few joiners.  For all of those who dont know, I'm talking about Breaunna Vance, the girl that graduated last year and always had like, pink and purple under her hair.  I just love her, she makes my work life a living hell.  If anyone wants to TP her house with me, give me a call man- im game.

Well this has been a pretty pointless post, sorry If I made you toooo bored.  I love you all!"

I dont even remember how I felt when i was really happy anymore... all I know its i felt a hell of alot better than this.  I just wanna feel like that again... I dont even know how I DID feel actually, it was just full i guess you could say.  I didnt feel sooooo alone and I didnt question myself or anything at all.

Today I had an interview at Texas Roadhouse, but i have to go back for a second interview b/c they dont hire ne one without 2 interviews.  I really hope i get the job though b/c I spend money like CRAZY and I dont even remember 1/2 the stuff I spend it on.  So basically... any free money handouts from you would be great;).

I'm really sick of feeling like this.  I dont even know how I feel really... Its just like I feel NOTHING. And when I feel sad sometimes I have no idea why.  Sometimes I really dont understand myself lol.  But Ryan (K) said that everyone feels like that sometimes so I'll just take his word for it.  

Ohhh and I LOVE the song Broken by Seether and Amy Lee.. Its so pretty and it kinda describes how I feel a little bit.  But anywho I think im done boring you for one day... Love you all!"

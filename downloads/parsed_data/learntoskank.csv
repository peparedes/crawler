"event","OK. here goes MY weekend.
friday: went to the jazz concert with jon, his dad, and his dad's girlfriend. it got pretty cold because i wore the skirt that i wore to school friday and the concert was outside at a park. but it was fun... jon and i ended up leaving early though. i came home at about 10.45... 15 past when i was SUPPOSE to be home... oops. summerlin parkway was closed so we got detoured and there was billions of people... which meant traffic. oh well. i got home and went to sleep at 11. 
i woke up at 5 and got dressed and ate and whatnot. we left to amargosa a bit late because when i was getting home last night the phone rang and it was my dad's alarm company for work. (i tried to wake him up, but he didn't get up..) so he had to go check it out because last time they got robbed. this time a door was just left open...
so here we go.. driving to amargosa. we got there about 8ish. and unloaded stuff. once we did all that, we ate and then headed out on trails. it was fun... we did trails and stuff until i finally got my dad to take me out to the dunes. i went on my mom's quad because there was no way in hell my dirtbike was getting through the sand. i couldn't control it too well in soft dirt!! and i hit some in a wash we went into and almost ate shit, but i managed to keep the bike upright.. anyways, me and my dad went out to the dunes.... WOW.. it was so neat!! i loved it. so we came back and ate, trailed a bit more, then i got on the back of my mom's quad and bakc out to the dunes. i recorded it the whole, bumpy way there. it was neat! recorded my dad going up some steep hills and stuff.. it was neat.. so basically we went back and forth between the dunes and camp for a few more hours then it got dark... my mom wouldn't let us go back to the dunes, but said it would be ok if i rode around our camp for a while since her quad had lights. my dad followed me so i went on one of the rodes. i checked every once in a while to make sure he was still behind me, well one time i checked and he wasn't... so i got kinda scared. i waited for a little bit but still no dad... i was worried because he had been drinking a lot of the day and he had no helmet because we weren't going far or on any trails. so i kept waiting and i finally see his lights. so i sat on my brake so he could see the brake light and know were i was. then his lights went out again.. then he got up to me and his quad died. he told me i had to go back to camp and get some tie downs. that sucked because it was raining and i could barely see because one of the headlights were out on mom's quad. i finally got back, told my mom and got the ties. i went back and got my dad.. i drug him and his quad back. then we had to get everything out of the rain.. well, we got that done and i crashed at about 9.30... i woke up at about 7 then 8.30 and we were all sooooo sore. we made breakfast and put everything away and got ready to leave. oh man. i am so freaking sore! AND i got a sunburn.. ay.. so i am not doing too hot. my arms, legs and back hurt pretty bad, but it was worth it. i want to sell my dirtbike and get a quad instead.. i mean, i really really like the dirtbike, but i can't go on soft dirt trails and i can't go in the sand. so that's my plan.. we got home and cleaned up. i was soooooooo dirty!! this morning when i woke up there was sand all over my pillow and in my eyes and hair and all this! it was crazy!! there was dirt like imbedded into me! haha!! 
but all in all, it was a fun weekend and i look forward to doing it again. next time, if we go before michelle's off grounding, i'm taking jon. my dad had me call him and tell him to ""load his quad and get his ass out there,"" but he said no.. oh well. next time i'll bring him if he wants to go... and then michelle will be coming soon, too!!! i'd take everyone but 1) not enough room 2) not enough quads and 3) my dad doesn't know everyone.. he knows and trsuts michelle and jon.. sorry!!  love you guyes anyways! 
but my parents are yelling at me to start the DVD player because the don;t know how!! HAHA! i'm going to go watch meet the fockers! this movie's great.. byebye"

"event","so me and michelle didn't go see the queen yesterday.. just the king. and might i say he treated us well! well, indeed. it was cool being with michelle. we found jones soda and we weren't even on a jones soda quest.. we were more on a fuze quest! but we found jones soda and man.. that shit is hardcore. we attempted to dye my hair, but it didn't work. dammit. oh well. lets see.. well, we rode some smooth bikes.. i rode out silver diamondback yesterday. wow. orgasm on wheels, as i told michelle. it was so smooth.. its real light too.. like i lifted it to get it over the garage curb and it like.. floated! hah! i lifted it to high. it is an aluminium frame.. nice. then i rode out turquoise diamondback cruiser.. not as nice. smooth but the steering is not as nice as the silver one. 
when i was riding with michelle part way home, i saaw some people messing around in the empty street behind my house.. i didn't think anything of it.. until i left michelle and turned around to go back to my house... i saw smoke. tons of smoke. RIGHT next to my house.. so i got real scared and thought my house was on fire.. my house has burnt down once before so i freaking out. i rode real fast to get back and saw more smoke, there were people looking around trying to figure out where it was coming from. there were a whole bunch of cars trying to see. well, it was a couch and bushes behind my house, they were on fire. so close to my house. RIGHT BEHIND IT, i told my parents and we went to go wet down out oleaders so if the fire did spread we'd have an ok chance to stop it beore it got to my house.. later, the fire department came and put it out.. scary. 
then i called jon and i went out with him. we went to pick up sticks.. man that place is good. then we went to his house. his dad, him, and ken are like kids! they are so funny! they have an Xbox right? well, they've got this golf game.. hahah! KIDS, i swear!! it was funny though..
my parents gave me an 11:30 curfew!!! it was crazy!!! hahahaha!
:sigh: long entry..

"event","ARG!
err.
ok. i am so fucking frusterated right now. 
1. jon
2. school.
3. parents
4. being a teenager <b>ANGST.</b>

JON. i love him, i won't lie.. BUT OMFG. ok.. os he is stressed out. right. he is working and can't maintain school right now. so he tried to quit earlier in the week, but they need him right now, so he couldn't do it. not that he <b>couldn't</b> do it, but <b>he</b> couldn't do it. they need him and he said he'll stay until they find someone. so he is stressed because he failing stuff. he feels like he isn't spending enough time with me. he is spending as much as my dad will allow. my dad is being LAME about this!! i told him that he wanted to see my tonight (which i will get into tonight later. %^$*!) and he wants to see me tomorrow. my dad is like, ""he doesn't need to see you EVERY day. you arn't married. you don't need to see eachother ALL the time."" OKAY. i like to spend time with him. WTF is so wrong about that? my dad thinks we are fucking and we arn't!! why can't he fucking trust me and get it through his fucking head that we are NOT having SEX?! what have i done that makes him treat me like i am out having sex?? why can't i spend time with him? he doesn't like me seeing him after school to go to LUNCH. WHAT is SO WORNG about that!?!??! we are going to lunch. we arn't going to do anything at the restaraunt. he tries to see me after school on mondays and wednesdays. then after work on either friday or saturday. IS THAT TOO MUCH?!?! 
OKAY. so tonight, he wanted me to go to band practice with him. i said no. they need to practice, their show is in a WEEK. they have had no practice without me or rochelle there. and they need to. BUT NO, rochelle will be there tonight and she is trying to get me to go too so we can hang out and entertain eachother. NO. i am not going. BESIDES THAT, i told my dad about it and he was on his 'you don't need to see eachother all the time' trip. so i can't go. and NOW rochelle is saying jon will be all pissy because i am not there and she is. and i know this. he will be mad because she's there and i could have come. so she is irritated because he will be pissy and take it out on them. &^@$#*^@!
SCHOOL. lame. fucking lame. i did real good this week. i did all my homework except for 2 geometry assignments and turned in everything. i even did some back work..
people at school=lame. i feel like i have no one to talk to anymore. everyone has heard my problems and i don't feel like burdening them with them or they give me no outlet. they don't help me out. i feel like i am losing all my friends. michelle and i haven't hung out in about a month. i kind of feel like she doesn't want to anymore... i am just like.. :le'sigh: i tried to see if she wanted to do soemthing tonight before nora's party, but she has an eye appointment.
i can't explain everything to people so that is my fault. i am just like.. yeah. 
PARENTS: i tried to talk to my parents about everything stressing me out. i told my mom i needed a hug and she said, ""why?"" ... i tried to talk to my dad and he got mad at me. i, like always, started trying to debate with him... i feel like the only thing i do right with him is school and right now i am not doing so good in that. i swear he wakes up to get mad at me. they arn't here. i feel like they are living their own lives waiting for me to get move out. then they can live how they please. i feel as though i am a burden to everyone. FUCK FUCK FUCK. i want to go to therapy, but i don't want to tell them i want to go because then they will ask why and i'll have to tell them what is going on and i don't want to. i can't. i don't want to tell anyone, but i do want to tell someone.. hence= therapist.

TEEN ANGST: i feel like i do nothing right and i am a burden on everybody. with my parents, i feel like i am not allowed to be depressed or stressed or upset anymore. i feel like i have to put on that mask again. i hate that fucking mask. i feel like my parents are angry at me when i am upset and i kinda mope through the house and i don't want to talk. they get mad at me... my dad always aske ""whats wrong with you?"" or ""whats your problem?"" 
i feel like i have no way to fix all this. 
i have gone this long and i feel like that light i saw, that light at the end of the tunnel, it was just a train and it's about to hit me.
i want to cut."

So, my friend, Andrew
<img src=""http://tinypic.com/1rqjjq"">
Got real sick on Wednesday (?)... He just passed out.. I sat there and held his hand until school police pushed me away... He had been throwing up blood all day. I am pretty worried but Cracker and Nathan Nathanial Nate said he sounds ok and that he'll be fine. It was real scary seeing him colapse.. I was just trying to help him walk. I was trying to hold him up and he just .. fell. I held his hand and talked to him and he didn't move. He didn't move or make any sign that he heard me.. It was scary..
<b>I love it how so many people are so interested in me and Jon's NONexistant sex life... HAHA!!</b>
I am kind of tired. I am hoping to spend time with Jon tonight, but I still have to ask my dad... I think he'll be okay with it, even though he ""has lost all of his trust in me..."" hmm. So it's a four day weekend this weekend and me and Michelle are GOING to spend time together. If not I'll kill her. Or just punch he in the face.. WITH MY FACE. 
yep.

"event","ok .. so lacii woke me up to let her out and then i went back to bed and dozed .. i had this dream ..ok, it took place on the last night that, i remember,  i tried to kill myself. i remeber that night so vividly, that i looked in my journal for the entry i wrote that night and it was July5.. the page was has a lot of blood on it ... ANYWAYS, my dreams goes like this, some of it went on in real life.. i was sitting on my bed and i cut the shit our of my arm. and then i wrote in my journal and i was still bleeding. the blood dripped on my journal along with tears.in some effort to write i wiped the blood out of the way (which smeared it ..). when i was done i went to bed hoping that iw ouldn't wake up b/c i was still bleeding when i went to sleep .. well, this is where it started to not be real.. my mom woke me up the next morning and asked if i wanted to go shopping. i sat up in my bed and said, ""yeah"". then she said my name again. i responded with, ""what?"" then she said my name again, a little more paniced.. it made no sense because i was sitting up in my bed.. then she came over to my bed and said my name again very  paniced and shook me. but not me because i was sitting up, she shook the body underneath me... i was dead. she realized this and ran out of my room and called my dad. i/my ghost got up and looked into my bedroom mirror but i couldn't see me! I could see my arm when i looked at myself, but i couldn't see my reflection. i sat in front of my mirror for a little bit and my dad came home.. he looked really upset and looked at my dead body in my bed, he just started crying... i tried to yell at him and say i was right there but he didn't respond. he took my body out of my bed and my arm was all bloody and it was on my shirt.. i don't remeber much after that, but i remeber a funeral. it was mine and everyone there looked pretty pissed. i remember seeing my parents and michelle, jen, colton, randi, jada (which is weird b/c we werent friends at that time), nathan, cracker, joe, eric, kaitlin, and some of my family, like my brother, sister in law and neice and nephew, i say my mom's side of the family, and my dad's... but the weirdest thing was i saw my grandma who died when i was six sitting next to my dad and he husband, my grandpa that died in febuary sitting next to her. nobody looked all that upset/sad, they looked pissed off. all of them. and impatient to get out of the service... it was weird... ok so that was my dream.. yeah .. weird. but i did wake up .. i hope .. :) heh! i did.

anyways, me and my dad returned my stereo and got a new one .. thats pretty cool! so yeah .. my mom is sick :\

"event","My only regrets are thing I haven't done. Honestly, when I look back on it all, I don't regret the things I have done. I don't regret cutting. It is something I learned from and it made me a stronger person. I don't regret not going to Cimmaron. I don't regret asking out Travis forever ago. I don't regret telling my parents about my cutting. I don't regret loving Colton, even if we may not feel the same now ..I don't regret any of it. I feel everything has happened for a reason, even if it isn't clear now. I am happy that I moved here even though I left my friends, but I have made the greatest friends, ever, here. It is weird how things can work out so well sometimes. Or take turns for the worst, which I don't even regret that. 

I don't know .. I wonder how things will work out when they are really bad. But they eventually do. And eventually get worse. The better. I used to go back and forth so much. I managed to make it through this week HAPPY. And it is close to Christmas. I get depressed around Christmas. It was a good week though. 

I am going to explain to everyone why I don't want gifts from people right now.  When I was younger, if my friends gave me something, I'd show my paretns and thy'd asky why or ask what I gave them back. And if I said they just did or that I gave them nothing back, I'd get into trouble. They do it a little bit now, but I still hate accepting things from people when I am not returning the favor. It makes me feel bad and I don't understand why ... So if you ask what I want this year and I say nothing there is a reason. I may not be getting anyone anything so, I don't really want anything.. Also, that whole thinking of what I want .. haha I have everything I want, when I really think about it. I look around my room and I feel so selfish because I have all these things and a nice house, I have food and clothes on my back, yet I feel so ungrateful. It's not the best feeling. So, I hope that makes you guys understand a bit more.

Ashley is in a good mood. I am going to the mall with Jada. It will be FUN! hehehe! Girl time! I got to hang out with Michelle tonight (friday)!!!! YAYAYAY! I gave her a Hanakah gift that is an inside joke .. Oh man it tasted so bad. Michelle thought so too, but I still think she enjoyed it...We also watched Aquabats!!!  Happy Hanakah, Michelle. And have good Holidays everyone!

HA kick them in the fucking head! also, the black people that get offended by a swazi b/c it has nothing to do with them! they just want to get offended by something new! oh well. the world is going to shit and I hope it takes a quick turn for the better soon, or my daughters will be leaving the house in napkins and it will be perfectly normal. another thing i worry about is the mass number of straight males wearing pink .. this totally puzzles me. also, i am worried because my can of pineapple is going to run out soon, then i will have no more pineapple... this is bad :D<BR>well ... that is my comment and its practically a novel .. sorry :(<BR>ashley and coffee""</P>

Giant squid will come right up
And pull your train right off the track.
Mammoth broom swoops on down
And sweeps you in a whole

Friends help each other
Any way they can

Hone those whittleing skills

Oh well. I am tired. Maybe .. I should go to sleep. Oh well. >.< ::yawn::
Went to therapy today. I've been ok, so it wasn't a bad session. I have been in a really great mood and it is kinda nice. 
Nora got an anti-eyebrow peircing and it looks soo freakin awesome!!! I noticed that when she came home (when I was at michelle's) she was in a good mood. I think when she is in a good mood she looks really pretty! I think I see her mostly in not so hot moods and she is still pretty b/c Nora is just cool like that, but she was happy and that was cool. Because nora is that cool.

"event","I am so sick of doctors and therapy then more doctors and there's going to be more therapy. I had three appointments yesterday. Two of which were dermatology and one was therapy. My dermatologist said I have high cholesterol and I have to watch it. I'm like WTF? I am only 15 and I have to worry about my cholesterol?! Not cool. Also, now we have to moniter my depression even closer because I could get taken off my medication because of 1. my high cholesterol and 2. my increased depression. I have been getting better. When I went to therapy, all my doctor wanted to talk about was my accutane (my medication). I have an appointment with her next thursday and an appointment with my orthodontist, the same day ... THEN the following week, I have another appointment with the chick that gives me microderm abrasions, glycolic acid peels, and extractions. My skin care consultant. I went to her yesterday becasue she is in the same office as my dermatologist. I got a glycolic ascid peel. I don't understand why some of this is necesarry. Also, my derm. looked at my back and said I needed to get a biopsy on a mole on my back. That I have had FOREVER. I don't get it. Also, she said I need to go to ANOTHER doctor. I need to go to my physician or a nutritionist to get my cholesterol down. GREAT. This is so scary. I am worried now about that biopsy. Why is there all of a sudden everything wrong with me?

Well, on to a lighter subject. I got a puppy Wednesday. Which to my supprise is still here. Her name was Mandi, but, my parents said it was to close to Maddie, my neice's name. Ok, and my dad hated it. He wants her name to be Kendel, in remeberance of his old dog that was murdered. Michelle and I decided to name her Lacii. Yeah. She is so cute though. 5 month old german shepard.  

Something great/bad happened Wednesday. Great is my group went into the cafeteria (which is something we never do) in a MOB. There were like 50 of us. All of us white. Backing up another white kid. Well, here's the story. It all started Monday when Chad decided to yello out nigger when the guys were playing football. Obviosly, some black kids got pissed. So they were trying to fight with him and a lot of the group got involved. Tuesday, these same black kids came over and started talking shit and fucking with us, where we sit. So, my fried Kyle blew up at them! Like EXTREMELY. They didn't fight and I was shocked. So Wednesday,  they were saying how they were gonna fight and all this. They never came outside because it was ""raining"". So all of us went inside. I guess one of them told their mom who called the school. When we walked in, they went to go get the dean! So we couldn't do anything. We all stood in our big group and waited. Then they told us to ""disperse"". They took Kyle and Hamm to the Dean's Office and they weren't at school thursday.  I heard that soemone sad that they had no idea there were that many white people in our school! Hahaha, considering we are the minority now. And that just pisses me off.

Jada went on for surgery on her shoulder yesterday ... I have to try to call her sometime this weekend. If you read this, Jada, I hope all went well! I'm sorry we couldn't do anything on Friday  Get  Better!!!!

Anyways ..

I don't think we would leave this year if we are even to leave at all. I don't even know if we are going ot leave. My mom has told my dad we have to let me finish highschool. So maybe we won't. But there are times that I sit down and think about it. Moving would be nice. I could start all over. No one would have to know about my past. No one would have to know about my cutting, therapy, anything! Fresh start. I know my ""fresh start"" here wasn't so hot. I could try again. I just don't want to leave my friends. But I also didn't want to leave my friends in washington and look, 3 years later, they are just memories in a box. Yeah that sounds horrible, I know, but I mean... I just know I'd get over it eventually. I just can't leave Michelle here. I can't leave my friends. But if my parents decide we are moving, I have no choice. And I will just have to think optimistically about it. I know we won't move this year, though. My dad has to actually work at this new store before he can get tranfered to another store all the way across the country. I don't think we'd move this school year either.

I wish my kitchen was done because I really don't like not having counters, a sink, and a stove. What song was it that I wanted to get tabs for? I can't remember, that makes me sad. My medication is making my lips hella-dry and my face dry. It kinda hurts. Whne I wash my face it burns. How much more of this do I have? Oh yeah, 5 and a half months. But in 5 and a half months, it will all be worth it. Just you wait and see.

So God (Marilyn Manson) came out with his new album today. I can't go to his concert because it is on a wednesday night. Parents won't let me go to a concert on a weeknight. DAH. This makes me so sad and no one has any idea ... This will be the second time I have missed him in concert. That is so disappointing. But I got to see other gods. KISS. I saw them in concert about a year ago. That was hot.

You know what I hate? When no one calls you all night, but you get a lot of calls where its like, no one or salespeople. I mean you get all, ""Hey! Maybe someone is ACTUALLY calling me."" Then, it's a salesperson. heh. But that's only if you are a loser like me who has no life and all of your friends do. BUT, if you ARE like that, then you are cool! And you know what? The sun never sets on the cool. OHHH! PHONE! ... salesperson .... GRR! >.<

I love Marilyn Manson ... &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

Don't mess with the fire, because you'll get burned!

 Dear Jen:

Hi. Alright, I want to say somethings and I don't want drama/fight/argument/anything. I just was this off my chest. First, I'm sorry that my breaking up with Kyle bothered you in anyway, but it was not fair to compare him and Colton about distance. I had been going out with Colton for a while before distance even came into the picture. I had been going out with Kyle for 3 weeks and saw him once in those three weeks, I've seen him 3 times total. They are on no basis for comparison. Also, you don't know the whole thing. I tried to call you and tell you last weekend, but you were with Sean and weren't picking up your phone. My dad didn't like Kyle, which in turn bothered me. You know, I don't care if he doesn't like my friends, but it bothers me when he doesn't like my boyfriends. You also know something about this because you and you dad have the same close relationship as me and my dad.  Second, I don't think you should worry so much about who I am in invovled with. Maybe I did say that I wasn't going to do anything with Colton again, but opinions and such do change. So I changed my mind or I am a liar, choose your evil. Third, I never said you didn't deserve Sean. I did say you take advantage of him. You both are jerking around eachother's emotions and in my opinion, it is causing way too much stress for the both of you. I hope you guys choose wether you want to or don't want to be together sometime soon, because it sucks having to see you both be stressed out about it . Then again, maybe I should just leave that whole subject alone ... Considering, as you have said in the past, I don't know what I am talking about... So I will leave it alone.  Fourth, we are drifting and I never tried to blame it all on you. SO, DO NOT try to act like i am! That's BS and you know it. If you read my whole poem and didn't just choose what you wanted to read, I did put it on both of us. Jen, you were my best friend and I still love you, but I can't handle your emotional changes, I know it's not your fault and I'm not trying to blame it on you, but they are difficult. I don't know how to act around you, I walk on egg shells. Sometimes, some thigs won't bother you and other times, you freak out. I wish I could help you! You have treated me so well, but lately not. Nor have I. (And I still thank you times 1 million for what you did on my birthday!!!!!!!!) Jen, I still want to be your friend. Don't forget that. Fifth, I'm sorry you don't like Courtney, but I do. So please don't so that thing (the sigh type thing, you know!! i can't think of how to explain it)when I talk about her. She is my friend, reguardless of what you think, and she has been. 

Well, Ok, I think that is everything ... I feel a bit better and I'm sorry if any of this made you mad, but I am not trying to. I love you, Jenny. Don't forget it. And your secrets are still safe with me. Don't forget our scar. It resembles how good of friends we are and it is our contract, our bond.

"event","Eventless evening. Parents are gone, went to the truck races. And now I am arguing with a guy about the female vagina, which he is convinced he knows more than i do even though i have one and he is lacking... oh well. now he's saying that you can tell when you ""popped"" a girl's hymen. which i am convinced you can't, but if anyone wants to correct me, go for it. 
anyways, off the subject of vaginas...
i bought american history X, but i think i already wrote that... well, then nothing new is happening. i am in a pretty good mood, except for a continuing fued with someone, who probably doesn't even realize that we are fighting, probably b/c i am the only one who actually cares about it all. no ... well. i mean... like, i am mad at her but she maybe just doesn't want to realize it and i am too lazy to point it out, so either i will just forget it or somehow it will be brought up (and i still won't talk about it :-D). maybe lazy wasn't the word there, i just don't want anymore problems. i can't handle it all, i have problems at home, so i go to school to get away from them, then HEY there's more at school... so yeah... i have been broke down a lot, i used to e able to handle a lot of problems and stuff, and now i can't and i'm not sure why.
oh well!
i am still in a good mood!"

"event","Hello. We had an assembly today and it sucked. i got to get out of classes early and hang out with my firends for a half hour + lunch, so that was good.


i am a little frusterated with someone. i am going to keep it to myself just so i don't cause problems. i just want to say it because it makes me feel a bit better. i am mad at you. ok better 

dad is drinking again. i can't handle it. i am not going to the truck races this weekend because of it. it's another excuse for him to drink and i am losing all patience. this has been going on for too long and it is definitly taking it's toll. so this week he has drank - sunday, monday, wednesday, thursday, friday, and probably tomorrow. he's not slowing it down like he said he would. that makes me sad, because he told me he'd slow down, not drink so much ...is it bad that half of me wishes he'd get alcohol poisoning just so he could take his health into consideration? i mean, i'm not sure if alcohol poisoning is fatal in if it were, i wouldn't want him to die, but just something to make him think. i don't know, i mean if he did get alcohol poisoning, then i would feel bad and all. ::sigh:: the worst aspect of my life right now ... me and my dad's relationship is going waaay downhill.

but this is cool -

This is a girl who was so great a few months ago.
We were combined as one.
We shared tears and we shared fun.
Our scar in the same place,
Reminds me of your pretty face.
Soon, it took over all.
You began to fall.
I tried to catch you,
But in this, I miserably failed, too.
Remeber that night?
You wanted to just get away from me, right?
You used to make me feel like I was the best,
Now, I am worse than all the rest.
All we do is get mad.
How can we forget what we had?
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you,
But don't forget you inflicted it upon me, too.
It was you and me,
Now it's not. How could that be?
""I need my pills"" she cries.
Without them it seems, she dies.
Drugs took over my friend.
And I really don't think it will end ..."

WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I HAVE IT???  i want too many things that i can't have ... like happiness, (this is a person, who shall remain unamed), and no problems, well not NO problems but minimal. i am tired of feeling like a burden to people as much as they tell me i'm not. i feel a burden to my family and friends. especailly my parents and closest friends..."

"event","Mr. Mars died. He was a PE teacher I had in 6th grade... He was murdered by a 14 year old and a 16 year old last Saturday. He was stabbed. The kids stabbed him as in initiation for a gang (this is what the police are assuming).

 


'He was my hero'

This story was published Friday, September 10th, 2004

By Mary Hopkin and Sarah Shilling, Herald staff writers

BENTON CITY -- Thousands of flickering candles lit up the Bears' football field Thursday in remembrance of the special coach who led the Kiona-Benton City Bears to a 25-0 shut-out just a few hours before he was brutally killed. 

About a thousand teachers, students and community members attended the memorial service to grieve the loss of Bob Mars, a Ki-Be Middle School physical education teacher and assistant coach for the Ki-Be football team. 

Mars was found dead Sunday morning from a stab wound that pierced his aorta. Two Kennewick teens, Jordan E. Castillo, 14, and Robert A. Suarez, 16, have been charged in his murder. 

Mars was remembered during the two-hour-long memorial service as a man with a big smile, huge heart and a unique way of getting through to his students. 

About a dozen speakers addressed the crowd. Mars' wife, Kris, embraced each after they stepped off the stage. 

""(Mars) taught me all the things I know,"" said Ki-Be student and football player Brian Pearsall. 

""He was the man I looked up to, a man I deeply admired. He was my hero."" 

Brian said the last thing he remembers Mars saying to the football team was that he wanted a shut-out against Columbia-Burbank High School. 

""A shut-out is what we gave him,"" he said. 

Brian presented Mars' sons, Kyler, 11, and Kody, 9, with footballs signed by the entire football team. 

""He was a huge part of our Ki-Be Bears family,"" said Rick Linehan, principal of Kiona-Benton City High School. 

""We honor the man he was and the lessons he's left us."" 

Michael Hazenberg, 22, and Roberto Sanchez, 21, Kennewick High School alums, came with a group of friends to the memorial. They'd both been coached by Mars while on the Kennewick High football team. 

""He always made you feel like you could be better than you were,"" Hazenberg remembered. ""He believed in every single kid out there."" 

Sanchez, who graduated from Kennewick High in 2001, also was coached by Mars on the Tri-City Rattlers Inland Northwest football team. 

""He was more of a friend than anything,"" Sanchez said. 

""He was a really good guy."" 

A table near the stadium's entrance was piled with notes, cards and a few gifts left for Mars' family, including a teddy bear, a candle with a picture of Jesus on the front and a few carefully wrapped wildflowers. 

Tucked underneath an angel figurine, a pink piece of ruled notebook paper bore a simple message: ""Bob, I love your care for our children. This was so wrong, you had so much more to do."" 

Dozens of messages to Mars and his family were scrawled in a scrapbook nearby. 

""He will always be the winner,"" one read. 

""I will miss you very much,"" read another. 

And in labored, childlike writing, someone wrote: ""I was on the Elks Richland Little League team. Thank you."" 

Tears rolled down the faces of 15-year-old classmates Amanda Molina, Haley Persinger, Lance Howell and Stacey Razor as they watched a 15-minute video presentation about their favorite teacher from the grassy hill overlooking the field. 

Mars, they said, didn't just pat students on the back and give them false encouragement. He made them prove it to themselves. 

""He told me I was the worst pole vaulter he had ever met,"" said Amanda, a grin suddenly replacing her sadness. 

""Then he took me to the sand pits, where I couldn't get hurt, and he trained me."" 

Now, Amanda said, she loves the sport and will continue to try harder, for Mars. 

""He wanted us all to succeed,"" said Stacey. 

""You had no choice. He wouldn't let you give up.""

 

I know so may of those people....

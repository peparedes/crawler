Only time, and a few more trillion proton collisions, will tell.</p><p itemprop=""articleBody"">In an e-mail, Maria Spiropulu, a professor at the California Institute of Technology who works with the CMS team at CERN, wrote about the Higgs: &ldquo;<i>I personally do not want it to be standard model anything &mdash; I don&rsquo;t want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted.

Well, the science-y stuff is way important, too ... But these italicized lines are examples of the attitude that seems to be prevalent in the scientific community. This is a big part of my answer to the folks who like to say that evolution is &quot;only&quot; a &quot;matter of belief&quot;. That is, those groups who are trying to tear down scientific theories in the public square, in an attempt to make their own religious belief systems look comparatively better. Equating scientific theories to religious belief systems is silly. In my mind, the main difference is that, while many human beings have a habit of getting very attached to certain ideas or ways of thinking, such attachments are thankfully not the norm in science. I cannot say the same for religious communities. The physicists interviewed in this piece seem to have no particular attachment to the Standard Model they&#39;ve been working with for decades. It sounds like they, as a group, would rather see it turned on its head. Conversely, religious groups seem to be irrevocably attached to the same old clusters of ideas. Instead of adjusting their understanding of the universe as new evidence comes to light, they seem to come up with rationalization after rationalization to justify the beliefs they already hold. Like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_hypothesis<br /><br />I can be convinced to adopt a new idea, or to abandon an old idea, given good evidence, and good arguments. Can you?</p>"

&quot;No matter how powerful and independent they are, women still want to be pursued, protected, and cared for by their partners,&quot; psychologist Diana Kirschner, Ph.D.
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/modern-romance?cm_mmc=Facebook-_-WomensHealth-_-Content-Sex-_-ModernRomance

&quot;This totally makes sense to me&quot; ... &quot;YAY&quot; ...

Why do y&#39;all sound like you&#39;re celebrating? Is it satisfying, comforting, to have everything so neatly packaged? To have clear answers? Men are this way, women are that way ... yes, yes, we all nod in agreement. Of course, similarities among men as a group, and among women as a group, are pretty easy to find ... if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, if that&#39;s the idea you&#39;re attached to. The minute I bought a jeep, I started noticing jeeps everywhere. It&#39;s a thing people do. But if you start looking for differences among men, and among women, you&#39;ll find plenty of those too.

If y&#39;all got Ph.D.&#39;s after your names, you, too, could make stuff up based on anecdotal evidence and have everyone believe you.
Here&#39;s a quote I like a lot better:
&quot;Psychologists&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp; including me&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp; always have to be looking beyond their own biases. They need to avoid getting so attached to a particular theory or perspective that they go out of their way to protect the theory,&quot; Conley said. &quot;Data should be the guide, and you have to look at data in every way you can think of to see if the story you are telling is really the best one.&quot;

"event","So over winter break, around 5pm one day, I was walking around downtown LA with Melissa Chavez and her picture-taking entourage. We passed this grungy-looking guy shouting about god ... and he had an AMAZINGLY loud voice. No mike, no bullhorn, just a dude you could hear preaching, over the traffic, from like 40 yards away. I wish he'd use that voice for something else. 

It got me thinking about the question that is sometimes posed, by preachy folks who want to give an audience pause:&nbsp;If Jesus had appeared to deliver his message in modern times, would anybody listen? The implied answer is no. Because, of course, he would likely appear as one of the lowest of our society, and when the down-and-out start talking religion, who listens? We often assume they're crazy ... and we're often right. 

But if I may pretend to be a believer for a moment, my answer to the question would be yes, folks would listen. Not everybody, but many. That's because, if the stories in the Bible are any indication, Jesus would not only rise from humble beginnings, just to test our habit of judging books by their covers. He would also be infused with godly charisma, wisdom, and intellect. The guy does have a message to deliver, right? Folks might initially be dismissive, as is our habit, but a good number would start to think, hey - this isn't just some schizophrenic transient, screaming about redemption on a street corner. This guy's different. Articulate. No disconnect from reality evident. And he's got all these fun fables ...

It makes sense to me that a government and its policies can often be measured by the quality of life of the majority of its citizens. However, quality of life does not only have to do with access to food, shelter, clean water, and the other &quot;basics&quot; necessary to sustain life. It also involves freedom, self-actualization, all that good stuff.

Around the border of the mirror, it said something like, &quot;This person is special.&quot; I suppose the folks who study these things have found that there may be some psychological benefit to telling kids they're special. If I remember right, and I may not remember right, that mirror didn't make sense in my little first-grader mind, and I may have even been a tad annoyed. 'Why are they telling me I'm special?,' I might have thought ... 'There's a ton of first graders here, and lots of people of all ages all over the place, so what the heck makes me special? What makes anybody special? If everybody's different from everybody else, then isn't everybody also the same, in that way?' Well, maybe I didn't think that exactly, but I may have had some inkling along those lines. Luckily, I'm not in first grade anymore, and I don't need anybody to make me feel special.

"event","Just got back from Vegas. Visited friends, hung out, bought fireworks, bowled, played blackjack... 

...wait...""bought fireworks""...? 

I have FIREWORKS! 
HEEEEE! :D 

I refused to make the same mistake I made two years ago. Back then (June 2005?) I was on my way with Justin Knox in my car to help move Tim back from Wyoming. I pulled into a gas station off the 15 just north of Vegas, and me and Justin saw a lovely sign painted on the wall of the gas station shop: ""Liquor-cigarettes-food-FIREWORKS..."" 

""Dood! ...EXPLOSIVES!"" 

I didn't have much money then, so I got a few cool items, including some random stuff I wasn't familiar with, but it looked fun. Then that 4th of July, I used it all, and I really wish I'd got more, cause some of it was really cool, and I had only bought like one of each item. So this time around, I made sure to grab at least TWO of everything I wanted. $98 worth of wondrous explosives. Ice cream made it $100. 

For the first time in my life, I have ROMAN CANDLES! Like, TEN of them! And holy shit I bought some giant rockets that were like $5 PER SHELL. Plus a shitload of tiny bottle rockets, little firecrackers, and other random goodies. And the ones I REALLY wanted I got three of... these little cardboard boats. You float them in water, you light them, they jet across the water and shoot stuff... not all that spectacular, but WAY fun... Those are my favorite. 

The shop was on Indian land, by the way... the Moapa Paiute reservation. Not a bad plan, that... the government gives you the crappiest middle-of-nowhere parcel of land they can find, and what do you do? Set up shop by the freeway and sell some wonderful illegal shit. Go them.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

At work recently, I read a handwritten letter from a client who wanted to tell his story... it included a quick rant about how he had moved to Vegas and then moved away, as he couldn't stand the place... it was ""devoid of culture"", he said. One thing that always strikes me about Vegas when I go there: I'll be walking through a casino, at any imaginable hour of the day or night, and I'll see folks sitting at the slot machines, poking away at the screens. They're often older, and they all look sad, tired, or bored. Doggedly chasing a dream, maybe? It's always such a sad sight to me. Now, I can't rightly guess what's going on in their heads. I might look sad or bored while I'm playing chess, for example, but behind my face my mind is working and I'm having a good ol' time. I dunno how you can get that same effect from a slot machine, but to each his own. I'm usually not too excited about gambling, but sometimes I prefer games of chance that involve a little more judgment and skill... like cards. There's money to be made in Vegas but not through some one-in-a-million jackpot. It's at the smaller-time games, where you can win a little here and there, where you can peck away at the house's takings. My friend told me something about gambling once that made perfect sense, but that had never occurred to me: pick a roulette table or a card game or any such thing where similar rules of chance might apply, and watch for a bit. Wait 'till the roulette table starts going one color, over and over. Or wait 'till the dealer starts to win. Then wait for the luck to turn. Jump in right then. Ride lady luck 'till she's sore. When the luck starts to turn again, get out. I won five dollars that way, but only by accident. If I'd trusted myself, I would've won ten. Blackjack would've paid for pizza either way. Not a bad deal."

"event","When I try to tell someone something in writing, I write way too much. But I have to fully explain the thought, you know? So I dunno how to write less without possibly sounding retarded... 

Enneyweys, this guy organized a swing workshop, and asked me to teach, and I said yeah, cool, and then suddenly I get a flyer with all the workshop info on it, and I was like, hmmm... I really wish I had had some input in the planning process... and I ended up sending him the below email just now, and I figured I'd store the email here for my reference in case anyone else asks me to help with their workshop in the future... plus cause it's so damn long I didn't wanna just delete it... 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the two-hour Big Apple slot btw... good idea. 

Do you have many sign-ups yet? Any idea how many people will show? 

Questions: to start off the Big Apple lesson, I'd like to show the students the whole routine on video. The original ""Keep Punchin"" clip is only a couple of minutes. It takes a group to do it, obviously, so me and Natalia can't demonstrate its awesomeness all by ourselves. I figure we'll try and plug in a laptop and have the video downloaded already, just so the students can see what they're going for... I assume there's no internet access there...? But there will be enough outlets for both the speakers/sound system and a laptop, right? Should I bring an extension cord? And I can just bring CDs to teach to, right? Are you familiar with the equipment at this place? If people dance near the sound system, will it make the CD skip? Does the sound system play almost anything, or will it reject my burned CDs? (I know these are stupid questions, but I gotta make sure...) 


Finally... 
I know, as I'm sure you do, that when you're in charge of something, everyone wants to give you their opinion on how they think things should be done. Well, here's mine (feel free to file it away with all the other crackpot opinions in the suggestion box): I would have charged less. Maybe the cost of renting the space drove the price up, I don't know, but I do know that $15 per hour-long group class is about the most expensive class you'll find in the SoCal swing community. Sure, there are others that charge the same price, but I'm not them. I don't have the teaching or dancing experience of Doug Silton, Peter Loggins, Shesha Marvin, Nick Williams, Jofflyn Valencia, Jeremy Otth, or whoever else is teaching around here nowadays. In fact, I think Jofflyn frequently charges less for his group lessons, and many other group swing lessons are less, too. So, in the case of this workshop, there are lots of more experienced swing dancers and swing teachers than I who are underselling me. I don't feel that people should be paying more to learn from me than they pay to learn from all those guys above. I would have leant towards maybe $35 or $40 for the whole day, and maybe $12 per individual class. And I'm aware, of course, that if you charge too little, many people won't value what you're offering as much... so there's a balance to be found. Anyway, there's not much to be done with my suggestions at this point. All we can do now is try our best to deliver what we've advertised. Which means I need to make sure to lead some really kick-ass lessons, to make them worth people's money. 

Just curious: did you ask Lupita to teach? Maybe she's a little burnt out on teaching swing nowadays, or not, I dunno. Did you ask Allen and Miki? Morgan? These are some of the people who taught me to dance. And what about Christian? Shane? James? They're all right there at Coffee Depot most weeks, easily accessible. I wouldn't mind learning stuff from them. (I'd learn from Sean, too, so I'm glad you grabbed him.) If I was you I'd try to recruit some of them for the next workshop, maybe, if they're down. I think you made a good choice asking me and Natalia to teach the Big Apple-- we probably know it better than most Coffee Depot attendees... but for Balboa, for example, I would have asked Lupita and Christian, or Brittany Wallace if she's around, or maybe Allen and Miki... or hey, why not go all out and ask Sarah Lerner, Nick Williams, Jeremy Otth, or even Peter Loggins or Sylvia Sykes to teach a balboa lesson... maybe they'd say yes, who knows? If you've got the best of the best teaching, then you could easily justify the price of the class... and I know fame doesn't necessarily equal good teaching, but experience often does. When looking for teachers, I'd shoot for the people who have been teaching and dancing forever. And besides the big names, there's many amazing swing dancers and teachers that keep a lower profile... Find them online or at swing clubs, and say, hey, I don't know you but I think you rock and I'm doing this workshop and it was pretty successful last time and you should teach... something like that. I'd love to help you recruit teachers next time if you want me to, btw... 

So anyways, thanks for reading all that, and most of all thanks for bringing swing to the high desert, however you do it. I know all of the above isn't good feedback, but some feedback is better than none, I figure, so there you go. And this is only one person's opinion, of course, so do your thing and take it for what it's worth. 

Love, peace, and hippie grease,

"event","Yesterday, I came home from work, and I wanted munchies. I had a glass of Guinness, a peanut butter and honey sammich, jello, and chips with Fritos bean dip. It was the best thing ever. Then I ran later. Good way to spend an evening. <br /><br />I've been playing this computer game called Cyberstorm. It's a turn-based, army-of-robots vs army-of-robots, Windows-98 kind of game that I used to play in high school. Which means Windows XP didn't want to install it, but fuck Windows XP. So now I'm playing it a lot, and it's WAY easier than it was in high school. Conclusion? I think I'm smarter now than I was in high school. Which is amazing cause 1) I was a smart cookie in high school and 2) I really thought I'd been getting dumber since. So yeah. I rule. At old turn-based sci-fi strategy games. <br /><br />I went on a cruise with Liz and her family recently. Late one night, we were wandering the ship after most everything had shut down. We went up on the ""observation deck"" to watch the night go by. It's a big open deck at the front of the ship, about nine levels up (out of eleven). There's lots of lounge chairs&nbsp;in tight rows&nbsp;across the deck. So we walk up the stairs, cross the deck, and lean on the front railing. Liz says, ""Is there something weird going on to your left?"" I look and there is. I see a girl with long hair, bent over between the lounge chairs, smoking pole like a pro. Can't really see the guy lying below her. We figure we'll give them some privacy, so we turn to go. As we approach the stairs to exit, a small group of teenagers come up the stairs. Cause you know-- wandering the ship at night is the cool thing to do when you're in high school. Wait--but, we... also... yeah.&nbsp;Anyways, I'm thinking, <em>should I warn them? Ehhh... Nope.</em> So the kids take a few steps onto the deck, and me and Liz turn to watch their reactions... a gasp, a giggle, a loud whisper of&nbsp;""Oh my GAWD!"" with the little girls covering their open mouths... Oh, drop the act, little ladies, you know what you did after the homecoming dance... anyways, it was funny. And kind of depressing. I wanted a blow job, too..."

I was told at work today that there's this restaurant called ""The Warehouse"" in Marina Del Rey, and that it would be a cool place to take a date: www.mdrwarehouse.com 


So there was a few people I met recently, not really connected to each other, that REALLY annoyed me... like, they were just weird and socially awkward and annoying and I REALLY didn't want to be around them or interact with them in any way... and I got to thinking, dammit, I'm weird and awkward too, what's wrong with me, why am I being such a hypocritical asshole... I'm a bad person. I must be getting meaner as I get older. That really sucks. I'll have to work on that, but I don't know how to fix it. Those people still REALLY annoy me! 

Then I was talking to two other people who I think are both cool, and very kind and patient. And they were gossiping to me about how the SAME peeps that bugged the shit out of me, well, the kind and patient people didn't like them either! For the SAME reasons I didn't! Whew. Maybe I'm not doing too bad after all. 

And speaking of awkward, writing that bit there using a big 'ol clump of adjectives instead of names... damn.

enderwigginsjane: no
enderwigginsjane: just tellthem HOW FUCKING STUPID they are
enderwigginsjane: how long would you have to date a girl in order to propose to her?
Aidan: Well, I'm not too keen on marriage in general, but I'm thinking a lot of freakin years
enderwigginsjane: really?
enderwigginsjane: how so>
Aidan: emotion and brain chemistry are against you, clouding your judgement in that sort of situation
enderwigginsjane: in marriage?
Aidan: so it's best to wait as long as you can, 'till at least the initial infatuation wears off, so you can make a good decision (in dating before marriage)
enderwigginsjane: EXACTLY
enderwigginsjane: but tell me about your views on marriage
Aidan: Logically, to permenantly and irrevocably attach myself to another human, especially one as mutable as a woman, seems like a terrible idea... it would take a really incredible girl, who is logically a good choice as well as emotionally, to override that inclination of mine... since that sort is so rare, I might never find one and so might never get married... and even if I did want to spend the rest of my life with a girl, I think that's a good excuse for a big-ass party and a little ceremony or something, but I don't think it's any of the church's OR the state's damn business... they don't need to know. 
enderwigginsjane: i see
enderwigginsjane: as far as the church:
enderwigginsjane: getting married is a commitment between 2 people, their community (not to be confused with governbment) and their god
enderwigginsjane: that's how i see the church as involved
enderwigginsjane: does the church have the right to tell you not to get divorced?  Fuck no
*** Auto-response sent to enderwigginsjane: I am currently away from the computer.
Aidan: sorry I'm running around doing stuff
enderwigginsjane: it's fine
Aidan: how is marriage a commitment that involves the community?
enderwigginsjane: you're commiting to them as well
enderwigginsjane: i have a hard time explaining it
enderwigginsjane: but marriage is spiritual as well & it is a commitment to your god, that's how i feel church is involved
enderwigginsjane: i agree that it's none of the govt's business
Aidan: to me, church is more of a ""community"" exercise, than a ""godly"" exercise... so I'm still not sure how community, and therefore church, is involved. 
Aidan: at least in my hypothetical marriage
enderwigginsjane: because you're not being married privately in your own home
enderwigginsjane: it's a public declaration
Aidan: kind of like a housewarming party... I invite my friends, but my later fulfilling my rent agreement isn't any of their business...
enderwigginsjane: ?
Aidan: (I have to go... you've got the last word... ready... GO)
enderwigginsjane: um
enderwigginsjane: i don't believe that just because it's a public declaration that it means that it's up to everyone that sees the couple to try to fix it

"event","Pick a soccer field or a football field, and jog along the side longways. When you reach the corner, turn around and sprint the diagonal to the opposite corner. Turn again and jog the long side of the field. If you're tired, you can jog as slow as you'd like. Just make sure it's actually a jog. Hit the corner, turn, and sprint the other diagonal. Keep this going as long as you want. Twenty minutes, thirty... more? You will have sprinted an ""X"" across the field's center. That's why it's called ""running 'x's"". Maybe, on a given occasion, it's morning, and maybe there's dew on the grass. If you can look at the field from higher ground, you can inspect your work. You'll see the lines where your footsteps have cut through the dew's shine. Heavier lines, if there's a bunch of guys running with you.

""Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler...""

Mainly quotes about staplers. And ""TPS reports"". I write lots of OTR reports. Letters, rather. You don't care what those are. Other kinds of letters too. Sometimes, a Social Security judge likes a letter I write, and somebody who needs money gets money. Usually they ignore the letters. I rarely know one way or the other, though. I found out recently that something I wrote two months ago actually did some good. I happened to come across the same file and saw how things had developed since I'd last handled it. Just a paragraph, nothing involved, but it worked.

"event","US Open was cool. Happened the day after Thanksgiving. The Brigade got fifth place out of six teams. That's not so good, obviously. I would have been ok with fourth place, considering the other performances. Some west coast kids who were, like, twelve or fourteen got fourth. Lame. But they're kids (and they were really good, though, for kids... I was impressed), so whatcha gonna do. 

The thing that killed me was my fucked-up bocker. Everybody, in the course of learning a bocker, or any aerial, has I'm sure thrown lots of shitty ones. I have, too. This particular fuck-up, though, has happened to me like, twice EVER in the year-plus that I've been throwing these things. And those incidents would have been right at the beginning, almost a year ago. Our hands slipped at the end. The bocker itself was perfect, but our fingers slipped away from each other, and we were downstage, stage right, and after that bocker there was supposed to be a pause for a couple of beats. If the routine had kept moving, it wouldn't have been quite so noticeable, but it was VERY noticeable, because we were supposed to be frozen, posed. She was supposed to balance on one foot. The bocker went over, and our hands slipped, and I saw her hop once to keep her balance, in her pose, and I'm thinking ""please fuck don't move any more"" and then she had to hop back one more time to deal with the momentum of the thing, and that last hop put her just out of my reach. I had to take a step out of formation to catch her hand. Very bad. Then we waltzed again. And in that routine, we were trying to move waltz in a way it wasn't meant to be moved, but that's another discussion. Likely two of the main reasons we didn't place higher, my bocker and the waltz thing... Thank god she landed the bocker, though. Kept her balance. Kudos to her. We found after that her hand had slipped in another lift with a different guy a few seconds beforehand. Both might have been on her, we don't know, don't care, either. 

The team got $200 prize money. $200 for 5th? Damn, we should do the US Open more often... cash money bling bling and all that... and maybe WIN, cause 1st and 2nd prizes are in the $1000 range... 

The great part about the weekend was the lindy room. Being a mainly west-coast swing event, they banished the lindy hoppers to this little room across the hall from the giant ballroom. Three nights in a row, that little room was filled to a comfortable capacity with nothing but pro lindy hoppers, till 4am. It's great when you end up at these kinds of events, especially for afterhours dancing, when only the pros (aka those who have a rabid affinity for swing) show up. You could grab almost any follow in the room and she would be spectacular. Nikki (Shesha Marvin's new wife, tiny, blonde, Shesha runs TJ's, they run the 24 hour dance-a-thon together, she competes nowadays with Mikey Pedroza, the spastic short brown-skinned guy who likes to compete in pro lindy comps...) said ""thanks, that was really fun!"" after I danced with her. Heeee... ""really fun""... She sounded sincere... and pleasantly surprised. I get that a lot lately when dancing with pro follows. They're pleasantly surprised. I think my dancing feels better than it looks, which is preferable to the opposite, I suppose. And my comp fees covered the whole weekend. Schweet.

I was reading the list of personality disorders in the medical dictionary at work. I found that a lot of them, in part, described some aspect of my personality. I kind of identified with the descriptions of the following disorders: obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, borderline, paranoid, passive aggressive, and schizoid. Now, I only found things in myself that resembled very minor, slight manifestations of the sorts of attributes associated with these disorders. I'm not crazy, don't worry. I did not, though, identify in any way with the antisocial, histrionic, or narcissistic disorders. Whatever. What my personality resembles or doesn't, what it's composed of, I'm not pondering, in this case. Reading that in the dictionary and laughing at myself was just a passing, entertaining interest at work. What interests me more is why I might have made those associations. See, I usually read horoscopes, personality tests, etc., and roll my eyes. I dismiss them, or at least most of their findings, and I am critical, sometimes overly critical, of their methods and results. Cause ain't nobody gonna package me, sum me up, tell me what I'm about, dammit. Nobody's gonna tell me who I connect with or don't, who I should marry or how I might behave. And that's the weird part. I'm much more open to the suggestion that I'm ""out of order"" somehow. That I'm weird, different, not quite diagnoseable, but maybe close sometimes. What does that say about me, and how I see myself? Very strange. Which I seem to be ok with.

"event","Below is a response I wrote a few years ago as a part of a thread on parenting. Well, I started to write it. I do that a lot. I got down some thoughts, but ran out of time, so I saved it to my desktop, and there it waited. Now, I don't remember what I would have added to it, or where the thread was, and I'm sure that thread is long forgotten now anyway, so I'm just gonna post this. You can guess at the content of the post I was responding to. 

-------------------------------------------------------

First, ""legal facts""... these are not moral facts. Not realities, just legalities. The results of the current trends of public perception, maybe right, maybe wrong. And that public perception is the problem... this idea of holding the parents responsible for a minor's actions is just one more example of a general trend- a feeling of entitlement when there is gain to be had, and an inclination to pass the buck when responsibility might fall too close to home. I think that feeling of entitlement starts with the way we raise our kids. (By ""we"" I mean ""Americans""- I can't comment on other cultures, I only live here.) Often, we shower them with attention and opportunity, from birth through adolescence- from headphones around mommy's stomach to tons of physical interaction to soccer practice and band practice and yelling at little Billy's teachers when they give him a bad grade. 

Sure, this helps the kids grow up ""better adjusted"", according to the research... How we define ""better adjusted"", or course, might need to be adjusted...  

But it also reinforces in kids the idea that they DESERVE all this. Now when these kids grow up, and their kid gets hurt at school, that now-parent DESERVES compensation, and someone's going to pay. 

Now we're trying to legally force parents to watch over their kids 24/7, to make sure the kid doesn't get the parent sued. And so the cycle continues. 

Would you seriously suggest that you should pay the bill for damage that you didn't do? 

And no, nobody had previously mentioned anything about lawsuits in this discussion. The two issues are connected, though, and if one is going to rant about a subject, one might as well consider the subject as a whole, rather than just one example. When people say, ""blame the parents!"", parents cringe and think of the repo man coming for their new car. That's the way it happens much too often."

"event","Myspace Boons Sexual Activity
A. Harvey for CNN 11/10/06


If you haven't already created a cyber profile on a social networking Web site like MySpace.com or Facebook.com, you're part of a rapidly shrinking minority. People of all ages, parents and children alike, are joining in the recently growing phenomenon.

But what's more phenomenal is the increase of sexual activity among young adults and teenagers. Researchers at the University of California, Berkley show that since the launch of Myspace merely 4 years ago sexual activity among young Americans has skyrocketed nearly 112% percent. Sound for alarm to say the least.

Home to the only place that you will find 15 year old ""swingers,"" Myspace has become the most frugal new addition for teenagers to meet and engage their personal inhibitions and express their affections towards one another.

One 16 year old teen, Jessica Mcbayne, aka ""Cynthia C-Cups"" has revealing pictures of herself wearing little more than undergarments and even more shocking a picture of herself appearing nude with ""scribble marks"" etched across her chest and lower regions. When we asked her mother, Trisha McBayne about her daughter's revealing photographs, her mother responded, ""I luh my baby! We taking over this (explicative)!"" 

Further studies show than nearly 1 in every 3 persons between the age of 14 and 25 who maintain a Myspace account have engaged in a sexual encounter with another account holder. Nearly 80% of that number have engaged in multiple encounters with various Myspace members.

The results are astounding. Whether theses peaks are coincident or not, one thing is certainly non-debatable. Social networks have become more than just places for young adults to post blogs, chat, and share ideas. 

----------------------------------------------------

I think that's awesome. Except for the ""mother"" mentioned above-- she sounds like a retard. Of course, that quote might be taken out of context. I can't assume much about her or her daughter from this article. In sum, god bless the internet."

"event","A while back, the Brigade had a gig at a rich-looking restaurant for someone's wedding party. By the Queen Mary. Complimentary valet parking. So after the gig, we're waiting and the valets are pulling up lots of nice-looking cars. Then comes mine. It stood out as the loud, dirty one that made funny noises. All squeaky and rumbly. I was so proud.

Y'know how people always yell for bands to play ""Free Bird""? The bands always assume the people are joking. Well, they are, mostly. But, overplayed or not, Free Bird is still a badass song. I say next time some heckler yells for Free Bird, the band should just play the damn thing. Rock that shit out. Why not?

I've been getting more bold of late. Instead of moving all the papers off my desk before I eat something, and being all cautious about it, I just spread a napkin over the files and eat what I'm gonna eat. Like a career bank robber-- you get too bold, you mess up, you're done. Today I spilled water on some guy's MRI results. Not doing that anymore. At least it wasn't something that stained. Just brush it off, and whistle my way along..."

"event","There's a character in the book, a helicopter pilot, who quotes a quote: ""George Bernard Shaw, I think, said if you were not a communist at seventeen-- you had no heart. If you were a communist at forty-- you had no brains."" According to google, the pilot is at least close in his quotation. 

The book goes on to tell how Israel keeps getting the shaft. The book is mostly strict nonfiction, except where names and timelines are concerned. It's one-sided, sure, but that one veiwpoint makes for some good stories. Like that of the two Israeli flying aces, the Walrus and the Carpenter. They can't, for the sake of international relations, shoot down the brand-new Russian MIG (and Russian pilot) that is patrolling over Israel on behalf of Israel's neighbors. So instead, they have to fly him into the ground. Draw him into a low-altitude chase, use the terrain, and trick him into crashing, Hollywood-style. Oh-- and the planes the Israelis were flying were obsolete training aircraft. Israel didn't have much else, it seems, thirty years ago. Fun times.  

""Zanek!"" seems to mean ""GO!"" or ""Jump!"". 

I'm learnin me some stuff.

"event","I hate ties, because they're totally non-functional. If I did some research, I bet I'd find that the fashion ancestor of the men's tie used to have some function, like keeping a shirt on, or a collar up, or something, but I don't want to do research. I just wanna rant. I hate having to wear ties. I feel silly. And they're restricting. I REALLY hope I can get away with not wearing one at work. Oh yeah, I'm working at a law office as a writer, basically doing the attorneys' dirty work, it's my first ""real"" job, I'm starting Friday, wheee. Ok, back to ties. I've got lots of them that have been given to me over the years. Never bought one. Ties are purely for fashion's sake, purely for display, and I'm not big on display. I'm big on content. I mean, if you're trying to look good, and you're wearing a nice shirt, at LEAST the shirt has a function besides looks... it keeps the wind off your back and stuff. The tie has no such merit. Like, if you're trying to be a phony (god, I sound all Holden Caulfield and high school and shit...), you'll wear a tie. If you're trying to take advantage of the fact that people often judge books by their covers, which is a dumb thing that people like to do, you'll wear a tie. In conclusion, and therefore and hereby and furthermore and all that shit, I hate ties. And I've got lots of them. The end.

I think too much about these things: 

""
Adun26: a note about choreography:
Adun26: I always end up doing this, and we kind of did the same thing when you were over here at my place...
Adun26: my brain gets fried, and certain parts of a routine just aren't coming together, and I just throw something simple in there to kill a few eights, and leave it at that. 

DsnyldGirl: that's fine  

Adun26: all the routines I've had a hand in end up that way
Adun26: my suggestion

DsnyldGirl: this is all VERY basic.... basically these people CANT dance or even find a beat..  

Adun26: is to come back to any routine we choreograph after we've had time to rest and think, so that it can be made better
Adun26: ok

DsnyldGirl: that makes sense  

Adun26: the best choreography, though, is so specifically fitted to a given song that someone watching, or learning it, sees that the moves make perfect sense where they are... which makes memorization much easier
Adun26: random moves to kill eights don't do that

DsnyldGirl: right..  

Adun26: take Amber's routine, ""Quiet""...

DsnyldGirl: this song is gonna  be easy. it's mostly 6 counts with some 8's mixed in  

Adun26: if I forget what move comes next as I'm performing it, the music basically takes me by the collar and tugs me through the moves... the music tells me what's coming, because the choreography is very logically fitted to the song. (sorry I was on a roll)
Adun26: (I'm done now)

""Do you see that white road, glistening in the summer sun of youth, and fading away into the purple haze of manhood? That is the road to knowledge ... Never again will you see a moment like this- you, flush with the spirit of glorious and unconquerable manhood, with life and all the world lying fair before your eager eyes."""

"event","Hokay. So. I want to get some people together for a game of four-way drunken chess. Who's in? 

WAIT! Hear me out... 


I have a four-way chess board (that Cecily gave me, cause she's awesome), and it would be cool to get anywhere from four to eight people together for a game. I'm thinking some setup like, you have to take a half shot every time one of your pieces dies. You'll start with 16 pieces, so a full shot per piece would be a little much... do the math... we might even have to tweak the amount of hooch per piece, depending on the alcohol tolerance of the people playing. A SOBER game of four-way chess might take three hours or more. I'm a fan of throwing lots of munchies in the mix. (These details are for those of you keen on figuring one's hypothetical BAC after this little adventure in strategery.) 

ANYWAYS if more people than four want to play, we could easily make teams of two, each team controlling one side of the board, either collaborating on moves, or (better, I think,) alternating turns. 

So we can work out the details and rules later, but the bottom line is the more pieces you lose, the more you drink, and you'll be trying to finish this game while smashed. Good times. 

BY THE WAY I see no reason why we couldn't teach someone to play who doesn't know how, so not knowing the game is no excuse for not coming. With the exception of my occasional moments of brilliance, I SUCK at chess. But it's still fun. So if you suck at chess too, that's also no excuse for not coming. Or- do you think you're good at chess? Let's see how good you are after six drinks... 

The most likely location would be my living room in Riverside. I'll pick a date after I get a feel for who wants to do this. Feel free to suggest dates and times. 


Uuber geeky? OH YEAH. 


Holla back, would you?"

"event","So I went ""off-roading"" on Monday, with Liz and Anne in the back of my jeep. It wasn't real off-roading, it was just us bouncing along some bumpy dirt roads, up hill and down dale. Good times. I've got my jeep stuck in the dirt before, way more easily than I thought it could get stuck, so I was paranoid. We were on the top of this one hill, and before driving down the trail I got out and looked over our obstacles, thinking, ""ok, I have to get my tires between these two rocks, and to the outside of that big hole there, and the right tires can go over the top of that rock there, and..."" And then I looked back at the jeep to see how much ground clearance I had, compared to what I'd be driving over. I walked back and announced to my fellow adventurers, ""my official conclusion is, 'just fucking do it'"". I was making the descent way more complicated than it had to be. So we just fucking did it, and down the hill we went, bouncy bouncy, and everything was lovely lovely, and now my car is dirty dirty. But there's a Karate Club car wash on Sunday, where I might take care of that problem. Squeaky squeaky."

I was sitting in my ""Issues in Journalism"" class, and my eyes were wandering from the teacher's powerpoint thingy, and on the inside of the door, it said, ""'Freedom of the Press' has been canceled today."" It's nice when teachers let students know about that stuff, you know... I always appreciate the heads-up."

And it seems I don't fit in anywhere... Confucianism might have scored high with me, but I guess they didn't call it a ""religion"", 'cause it's not on this list. Buddhism is definitely not for me, though I'm sure Siddhartha was a cool guy...

"event","A professor of mine once felt it necessary to point out the obvious to his class-- that certain aspects of the college lifestyle are no longer socially acceptable after you graduate. Like binge drinking, or living below the poverty line. Like rolling out of bed and going through your daily business unkept, in your pajamas, cause, like, who am I trying to impress? Like keeping a couch by the fire pit you dug in your backyard. 

On ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"", the Fab Five often accused guys of being ""stuck in college"", still keeping their living spaces looking like college pads at the ages of 25 or 30. That's one thing that pissed me off about that show. There is a spartan practicality, a logic to the college lifestyle that is admirable. College is the last bastion of adolescent contempt for the ""adult"" world. You get wrapped up in that world, you buy in. You forget the things you used to ""know"". 

If you're so wrapped up in something that you can't look at it objectively, weigh its qualities and faults, judge it from an outsider's point of view, then your judgment is a bit impaired, isn't it? 

Getting smashed once in a while has a similar, but shorter-lived, effect.

So? Let's not forget."

They (the high school kids) needed an extra person to even out the teams in a game of guess-the-word-thingamajigger or whatever it was called. One guy was trying to get our team to guess the word ""Cinderella"", and he said something like, ""Ummm... old Disney movie... think of the saying, 'If the shoe fits, wear it'..."" And I answered right immediately. ""Yes! Score one for the old guy!"" he said. ""Um, no offense, dude..."""

"event","Holy cats. Today is going swimmingly. As my experiments with the full corduroy suit continued, I looked corduroy up on wikipedia to see if I could find any helpful pointers about finding corduroy shoes. Not only did they give a detailed description of why corduroy is generally considered unfunny, they gave a link to The Corduroy Appreciation Club. This is a club formed in November 2005 that gets together on a semi-regular basis to give corduroy the appreciation it deserves. Their first meeting was on November 11th 2005, because 11|11 is the date that most closely resembles corduroy. Members are required to wear at least two articles of corduroy at each meeting. So because I clearly belong in this club, I registered on the internet for their contact list. They have a letter thanking you for registering that they sign ""Cordially, The Corduroy Appreciation Club."" Cordially.

Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young are playing in Toronto on July 10th. They're kind of old, but at two or more of them still kick ass, and the other two were more about rhythm guitar and harmonies anyway. I'm not sure how much it costs. Tickets go on sale May 3rd, midnight. Any fans?"

"event","That ghetto name generator is the funniest thing ever. Here are some gems I found, presented in table form, because I'm cool that way:

Real Name                        Ghetto Name

Ernest Rutherford                Tempestuous Teapot, Yo
Erwin Schrodinger                Peeping Joe Shizzlemah
Enrico Fermi                     Fellatio Kawfi
Xavier Desilets                  Sexxmaster D
Victor Zwetkow                   Doctor Get Down
Gerry Zion                       Gangmaster Jones
Carol Bromley                    Rectal Kool
Milada Prachar                   Toilet Duq Cwac Cwac
Paul Di Stefano                  Puppy D
Terri Smiley                     Wankmaster Shizzlemah

The last two aren't especially good, but prompted colourful commentary from my mom:
""He IS a puppy d!""
""No! I don't want to be a wankmaster with Ms. Smiley!""

and of course...

""I think Mr. Desilets is definitely a sexxmaster."""

"event","Such a good day! 

I started it off with some David Bowie and Joni Mitchell at breakfast. I finished my lousy French essay before homeroom. It's about downloading and similar issues. My main argument is a quote from Zac Jardak I pieced together from a number of conversations we've had where he reasons that downloading films causes layoffs at his movie theater, thus increasing his hours and chances of walking in on a gay couple trying to have sex in the men's room. The secondary argument is basically claiming that Justin is a member of the organization I'm writing to and calling him an alcoholic. On second thought, when I said lousy, I really meant awesome. I played a little bit of Pass the Pigs in homeroom and got a good report card. David Chafe got really upset in math about two things: When we would ever need to use a cotangent and why he has to lose marks for handing in his assignment late because he forgot to hand it in yesterday and couldn't find the pile. Mr. Diacoumacos threw a true curveball in economics by giving us a free period, which I spent helping people with chemistry and having a fire drill. I got a handout about public speaking in English, which got me really geared up to talk about stingrays in a couple of weeks. French was characteristically dull and stupid, but Laymo and Charlotte are fun. I had Supper's Ready, a 23 minute Genesis song stuck in my head during the chemistry test. Zigby didn't show up to physics for soccer or something, so Ms. Knowles substituted and it was a free period. 

I went home and noticed how nice it was outside. So I set up a bean bag chair on my lawn, fired up a whole lot of Beatles, and looked through the general education booklet Dawson sent me. I'm definitely taking beat poetry. I talked to Steph and my cousin Laurie for a while on the computer. I made a saturday plan with Michael and Travis, which was a bad idea because I have to make the Charles Mingus hoemwork. I had some pasta and met up with Laymo to go to Ben's party around 9:00. A successful shindig; great times with great people. Justin and I walked home around 4:30. We stopped at Dad's Bagels to get some naan bread. There was this girl being a bitch and trying to pay for her bagels with a fake ten dollar bill. She got really angry, insisted the cashier was fucking with her, threw a bag of bagels around, said the cashier would feel like ""a boombaklutz idi-ote"" when he found out that her money was real. The cashier called teh police, so Justin and I stuck around to be witnesses. A depressing exchange:

Policeman: ""So you're fine from the bag of bagels she threw?""
Cashier: ""Yes, it did not hurt: She is, ah, the woman...""

I just got back, so I'm going to go get some sleep."

"event","It's been a fun weekend so far. Mr. Zion's student teacher lent me l'Etranger. I started reading it, and it's pretty good. Ms. Smiley's student teacher gave me and Nick bonus marks on a Kite Runner assignment we did because of the graphs we made. The first was entitled ""The Kite Runner Gets Worse and Worse"" and was a parabola with two dots above it to form a frowning face. It was scaled in quality measured in thumbs up versus time in pages. The book peaks in the middle with twenty thumbs down. The other two graphs were tablature for sweep arpeggios. After school, I went to get tickets for a Joe Satriani and Eric Johnson concert in April with Nick and Greg. Between that and Yngwie, there's going to be a whole lot of virtuoso related humour in the air. I made an appearance at dance show. Lauren said she'd meet me there, but ditched me. On the bus ride there, I talked to this bearded guy with a Russian accent for a while. He tossed the word ""the"" in front of pretty much every noun. ""It is necessary for the whiskey to be in the chair, it is for the party."" ""Tomorrow, I am going to the Europe."" I hope his trip goes well. I showed up late, but still on time to see Mr. Zigby do the Time Warp again with Ms. Abraham, Mme Goudreau, Mr. Desilets, and some other person. Sooooooo worth it. At intermission, I had somewhere between eight and ten cupcakes for dinner. Most of the rest of the dance show followed a plot based on a mob group committing some crime and so forth. At one point, they show a list of people that went missing because of the mob, and there's a picture of Paul Sugarman. Sooooooooooooooooooooo worth it. Jess Spagnolo wants to be in the Charles Mingus clay-mation movie. I could see her being a good voice for the art teacher at the adult education center. I got back to my place and watched Burnt by the Sun, one of the movies Ms. Smiley lent me a while ago. It's about Stalin's Russia and communism and such. I was pretty tired, so it was tough to follow. It's a good movie though. I'm lending it to Mr. Di on monday. Tonight, I went to a party with the Bolivia trip crew at Alexa's grandparent's condo. Mr. Di didn't feel like watching a bunch of teenagers drink and smoke, so he didn't come, but it was fun regardless."

"event","Everything is pretty snazzy. Started watching The Corporation in economics. Overrated and bad. Mr. Diacoumacos was funny in that he even gave us free time from watching a movie. I'm kind of disenchanted with movies. Everything happens too quickly to make meaningful points. I haven't seen a really funny movie in a while either. Bad movies like Metal: A Headbanger's Journey are always more fun than movies aiming for quality. I'm totally gearing up for Snakes on a Plane. Apparently Crash won an Academy Award. Boooooo. What a shitty movie. Way to miss the point. A line from the movie when an Iranian man wants to buy a gun to protect his store:

""You can take the jihad elsewhere, Osama!""

 Ms. Smiley lent me One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Burnt by the Sun, Kendra lent me Greendale, and my neighbour lent me some compilation of TV debuts of a bunch of musicians. Lots to watch. I'm lending Burnt by the Sun to Mr. Di after I watch it, along with some Charles Mingus and Led Zeppelin. I miss spending a solid 22 hours a day with him, and pretty much everything else about Bolivia. Oh well. It's good to be back. I had a great big family dinner at my dad's house for my step grandma's 76th birthday. An excerpt from a conversation with my dad on seeing me doing math homework:

""What language is that baby set to?""
""German.""
""Ohhhhhh yeah.""

My step-grandma on serving herself a piece of a birthday cake my step-mom had decorated with a floral design made with green beans:

""I'M NOT GETTING ANY BEANS, DAMNIT!""

My step-uncle Jake's reply:

""Have your beans, mom!""

Jake once again, this time to his wife Mimi (they're still charmingly in love):

""I'm going to go get something from the car. You come too, Mimi, so we can have a moment.""

Jake's daughter Julia, asking for help with her homework:

""Matthew, do you know who the judges are on Canadian Idol?""

My brother William, being asked whose birthday it is:

""MINE! I'M ONE! GIVE ME CAKE!""

What a strong batch of relatives. I'm going to go sleep up to kick some conic ass tomorrow and watch some of my neighbour's dvd. Apparently it has John Lennon footage."

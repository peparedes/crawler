wednesday night i went bowling with nicole and then spent the night there. we woke up at noon and then i came home. i ate dinner at my aunts, and my family was up from georgia and florida so that was cool. after dinner i went home for a while then i went to alisons at like midnight. she fell asleep but i stayed up until we left for shopping at 4. when we got to best buy the line went around 3/4 of the building, but somehow when we got in the store we were like 6th in line for the ipods. they didn't have the 4 gb nana which was what ali wanted, but they had the 60 gb video so i got that. then we went to target and got ali's ipod. then we went to circut city, old navy, walmart, office max, and mc sports. it was fun, we got back at like 9 o'clock and then i finally fell asleep. now i'm awake and doing nothing."

Anywho, after that i went shopping with ali and mary in grand rapids. i got a dress, but i don't really like it. i might wear ashley's i don't know yet. i also need to find a date for formal, but that issue could be a whole nother post. after shopping i went home for about 6 seconds then i went to lauren's house with ashley, megan and patience were there and we played games. now i'm back at ashley's and were going to watch desperate housewives because she has never seen it before.

so the first week of school wasn't bad, my classes are okay, but student assistant is my favorite. we had three games this week and we won all of them. last night at dowagic, haleigh fell adn dislocated her pinky it was disgusting, then ray ray fell and twisted her ankle through her ankle braces and all, but we still won. we don't have practice until monday which is cool. today i think i'm going to go to sporting image to get prices on the senior shirts so we can have people order them next week. but, that's about all i have to say."

You Know You're Too Big of a Harry Potter Fan When...

~You mutter nonsense latin words under your breath. 
~You call your least favorite teacher Snape. 
~Your computer says ""You've Got Mail"" and you run outside looking for an owl. 
~You actually ask for a broom for Christmas. 
~You mutter ""lumos"" under your breath every time you turn on a flashlight. 
~You sort everyone you meet into the four Hogwarts houses. 
~You were burned when you couldn't get through the flames of your fireplace. 
~You had to go to the hospital after you broke your nose running headfirst into the wall between platforms nine and ten. 
~The wand order mistake in GoF drove you crazy, and even after it was ""corrected"" you still came up with dozens of theories to explain why that happened. 
~You point a normal things like parking meters and say ""Look at the things these muggles dream up!"" 
~You collect plugs. 
~You try on every piece of silvery fabric your mom has to see if you turn invisible 
~Before getting up to get something, you always try to summon it first. Accio TV remote! 
~You watched ""Love, Actually"" because two Harry Potter actors were in it. 
~You were reduced to tears when you finally had book 5 in your hands. 
~You refer to your Chemistry class as Potions. 
~You spend hours tapping bricks in special orders hoping that a secret entrance to Diagon Alley will appear. 
~When playing chess, you yell orders to the chess players and get upset when they don't move. 
~You yell into the ""fellytone."" 
~You get emotional every time you hear ""Hedwig's Theme"". 
~You say ""wicked"" all the time because Rupert Grint does. 
~You get thoroughly overexcited every time you see a word somewhere that is distantly linked with HP (ie. Saint Hedwig's). 
~You name all of your pets after HP characters. 
~You get in to heated arguments over how much gel Tom Felton had in his hair in the first two movies. 
~You know that Harry's birthday is July 31, 1980, Hermione's birthday is September 19, 1979 and Ron's birthday is March 1, 1980 even though it never said in the books. 
~You refer to Voldemort as ""You-Know-Who"", and no one has any idea who you're talking about. 
~You went out and bought the latest editition of the Webster's Dictionary because they added the word ""muggle"". 
~You were kicked out of the movie theater for standing on your chair, throwing your shoe at the screen and yelling ""THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BOOK!"" 
~You count the days until you're old enough for your apparating license, and everyone else thinks you're talking about driving. 
~Your free time on the computer is spent constantly refreshing your favorite Harry Potter news site (MuggleNet, of course), hoping for an update."

so conditioning is like conditioning always is, hot and tiring. but we only have 3 more and that is the last conditioning i will ever have to do so i guess that is good. yesterday my mom and me went shopping and  met ashley for lunch in kalamazoo. i didn't get much, only some clothes and some school stuff. i'm hungry so i'm going to stop typing. OH YEAH, new mood theme, harry potter rocks."

so bri drops me off at home and went to alisons. after a while they came over and we watched the end of wimbeldon and then we went to alisons to watch the fireworks. we went on laurens boat for a while then we came in and lit off some fireworks and now i'm home and really tired and really burnt. but it was fun. well csi is on so i'm going to go. peace out."

"event","so putters was a blast. after school i went to ali and carey's game, then after thier first game i left and went to ashley's. when their game was done we went to her house then to pizza hut to meet lauren, but we had to go back to her house because drew broke her van door. he slammed it so hard a screw bent and it wouldn't latch. well, then we went to putter's, i don't even have words to describe how funny it was. i hit ashley in the head with the handle part of the golf club and she looks at me and lauren and goes ""did you see that bug? it was huge."" i was like umm... then drew missed a putt by a little bit and lauren goes ""oh...only if your club was bigger."" it was so hilarious, but i guess you had to be there, because as i'm typing it it doesn't sound as funny. then we took pictures and there's one of me humping a baby elephant, it's so funny. 

anywho, tommorow i might go to bronson with bri and carey and ali, if ali stops being stupid. well i better go because we're leaving early. adios"

so i guess david thinks i'm going out with patrick. oh well, he is going through what i went through with him. 
my mom is really mad i'm not hanging out with him any more though. 
but enough about david. i start at sugar bear on sunday at 7 and i have the NHS thing on sunday. i'm applying at felpaush too so lets hope that works out."

We got out of school early on friday after meaps were done and a bunch of us went to that coffee place. i had a smoothie it was good. after that kelly and i went to the bank and we met dan and david there. then we went to david's house and had a dead bird thrown at us, it was gross. jake and daryll (i think i spelled that wrong) came over and they played x box live while we watched saved. i don't think the guys liked saved, but i love that movie so i don't care. then we played a game, that was...fun. then kelly and dan left at like 3. josh came over at like 3:30 and we watched wrong turn while david made chicken that i couldn't eat because it was friday. brianne got there around 4 and we watched the end of wrong turn and then we watched saw. brianne thought it was scary. while we were watching saw dan came back over, but he fell asleep. me and bri left at 6:50ish and i thought coach carter was on, but it wasn't so we watched are we there yet and then bri went home. kelly and me were bored so i rented raise your voice and went over to her house. that was like the best movie ever right kelly. her brother must not have heard a lot of people sing. anywho, we started to watch garden state but it was weird so we went to sleep. kelly had to work this morning so i went home and have been working on my psychology paper. tonight i think i have to babysit at the rif carnival but if i don't i'm going out to eat with alison. after that i think i'm going to spend the night at amanda's with her and jordan. but yeah, i've typed a lot so i think i'm done."

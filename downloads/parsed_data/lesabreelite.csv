"event","I'm lost. I'm surrounded by boxes and boxes of things that need to be shipped. I'm so organized in my planning, keeping list after list and checking things off one by one (you know my weirdness). But in all this organization, I'm lost. What am I doing? Where am I going? Why am I leaving the things that made me feel found? 

I needed a case for my many pieces of jewelry so I went rummaging through my room to find a box. I found this cherry wood case that had belonged to my parents or grandparents before it came to me. I can't remember what had originally come in the box, but I remember wanting it so bad.  

It was covered in dust now, having been shoved in the back of my closet for some time, since prom I thought as I wiped it clean. I opened it up and touched the soft crimson velvet with my finger tips. I smelled the same sweet perfume I had sprayed in there long ago, when it first came into my possession. This had been my time capsule. My precious moments box. It kept items from my favorite memories in it. 

<b>There were four rocks</b>
-One was blue and white, shiny and smooth. It was bought by my mother and father for me in a small shop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee after much whining on my part. Gatlinburg, my second home. *Really, we have a house down there :-)* I spent so much time there when I was little. The arcades were so much fun, spending hundreds of dollars to get a twenty dollar stuffed animal. The hiking and shopping, occasionally seeing a bear. Every time we went I always rolled down the window and smelled the mountain air. Yes, it was just air...but it was different and pure. I loved that smell: trees, dirt, creatures, unknown things. :-) I loved it.
-One black stone was there. Smooth and sleek, my mother had given it to me when we remodeled our basement years ago. I love that basement so much. It has been home to many favorite movies, a few parties, time with my dogs, roller skating with my sister, making movies of elves and witches, and being Ariel and Darcy Grant (A.K.A. the Little Mermaid and my made up character I pretended to be for so long). 
-The third was a chunk of fools gold I had stolen from my sister long ago. I don't think she ever knew it was missing. haha. I took it because I wanted something of hers. It was at a time when my sister and I weren't getting along too well. She was just too old and hip for a little brat like me. But I adored her, she was my idol (still is from time to time). So, to show my admiration for April, I stole one of her belongings...(how does that work out again?) But still, it was kind of cute of me. ;-) 
-The last rock was shimmering gold. My grandparents had given it to me when I was eight. It was from a trip they had taken to Maine. My grandmother had brought some back and given me one. (Thinking back on it, I asked for a lot of things...greedy little Cici) I thought of my grandparents. Wonderful people. For most of my childhood they lived in the house to the left of us on a big farm. I walked over to that farm all the time. I'd help my grandma clean out the manure from the horse stalls. I thought it was so cool! My grandpa was the first person to teach me how to ride. I was so little on this pony named Dusty. I can't imagine what my life would be like if he had never put me up on a horse. 

<b>There was a little music box and a rose bud</b>
-The music box played ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" from the Lion King. I loved that song so much. I played that song all the time, I couldn't get enough of it. And I'm still trying to figure out why that song was so important to me, but nonetheless it still is beautiful. 
- The rose bud was from a dozen roses my Dad gave my Mom on one of their anniversaries. I love roses so my mom let me take one. When it began to die I cut off the top and put it in the case. I drenched it in perfume so it would smell nice. At the time it was overkill, but now it smells really nice. I guess I was a pretty smart kid after all. My parents have been wonderful to me. I have asked for so much from them and they have given all that they could. I mean, I had two horses, how many people can say they got to do that when they were a kid? Plus, I got to play softball and the horse. Every Wednesday after school I would drive to the barn. My mom would have already been there for an hour to turn my horse out and clean him up before my lesson. I never thought about it then but that is so important to me now. She cared about me so much to give up her time to watch me ride and help me take care of my horse. She drove me to shows, she cleaned my tack, she did everything I didn't want to do or couldn't do. How do you ever repay a person for something like that? 
My Dad was the same with softball. Every Monday he would drive me to my lesson and catch me (even with a sore knee). Every weekend he would leave home and go stay in a hotel for two or three days just to watch me play. And when I couldn't find a good team, he made one for me and became a coach just because he wanted me happy. He even took off weeks of work to drive hours and hours away for tournaments. And I would get so mad at him if he couldn't help me fix a pitching problem, when the whole time he was just being there for me. 
My parents put up with so much from me for eighteen years. I wasn't the best of children and I've had my moments when I really thought they hated me (with good reason). But they're my parents so they stood by me, through everything.

<b>Then the corsages</b>
-Two of them to be exact. One from prom, the other from another UA dance I can't remember. I remember I had tossed the one from prom into the box just before I took a long nap the day after prom. Ya know, they say that prom is either the worst day or the best day of your life up until then. But mine was just a day. It was a chance to be with the most wonderful friends I've ever had. It's hard to believe, but yes, I've had trouble making friends in the past. It seems that some people don't appreciate my honesty and find me rude and tactless at times (surprising indeed!). But the friends I have made at my years at Ursuline make me speechless. What can you say about the people in your lives that don't have to care about you like parents, but choose to because they are your friends? How do you tell them how important they are to you as you walk away from them to go to college and make new friends? How do you stay in touch? I don't know. But I know that no matter what, they will always be my fondest memory and I will remember them daily, because they are who I am. They formed me and molded me, right down to my accent and mannerisms. I love them all so much.

<b>Finally, a snip of black hair tied with a rubber band</b>
-It was horse hair. I had cut it out of Le Sabre's mane when we moved him to the barn in Kentucky. I wanted to have something of his close to me. Of all the wonderful things in my life, Sabre and Promise were the best of all (not to put anyone else down) but they were all mine. My babies. OH, how do I tell you how they changed me and how much I love them. I know that going away to college will be one of the hardest things I'll ever do, and that they'll be many challenges ahead of me. But nothing will ever be as hard for me and when I walked away from Sabre for the last time. I spent so many hours with that horse. He knew everything about me, more than I even know about myself. He was my hero, my best friend, my companion, mentor and student. He trained me just as much if not more than I trained him. I love those two horses more than anything in the world. And I still wish that I could go back and choose Sabre over everything else. I would give up everything to go back and ride him just one last time. Fly across the open field one more time, and jump a course again. Time heals all wounds, right? But it doesn't heal a hole in your heart that you try to fill but can't. God I miss them. 

And then I closed up the box and slid it back into my closet to get dusty again. Perhaps when I move out four years from now I'll find it again and remember all the things I remember now. I'm sorry this was such a rant. I didn't realize I would get this worked up. I love you all so much.

Good night."

Why does that just make so much sense? It's so me in so many ways and it's the first answer that came up. Ya know, I'll probably remember this and say it when I die just to make it write and tell my kids to call all of you and tell you that the livejournal quiz was right. Because I'm just that weird.

And yesterday I finally saw the Two Towers. It was unbelievable! Orlando Bloom is still the hottest thing I've seen in a long time. I love Legolas.
I just love The Lord of The Rings!

I talked to Molly the other day and she's in a sorority with Molly Bassano. She's really happy down there and hope she has a good time.

And the other day I passed an eight year out in a croptop and booty shorts shopping with her mom....can people get anymore disgusting!? Eight year old whore walking through the mall! Ah!

I'm going to miss those random people that pop in and out of your life making it enjoyable. I spent two hours yesterday cleaning out my literal closet getting rid of clothing and toys I no longer need or want. It was nice to clear out the space, but a little nerve racking because I was going through my clothes thinking of which to take to college when. And then I got to wondering why college has to be such a big deal anyway...I mean, why do they decide that eighteen is a really good age for a person to move away from there home perhaps forever? Why? My mom told me today that I don't have to go if I don't want to, but I'd have to get a job and move out on my own somehow...so I decided to choose college. Bah! What a rock and a hard place that little situation is!

Ah well, there is no use in complaining about something I cannot control. And I'm sure I'll have a wonderful time once I get there, well, maybe not wonderful but good-enough-to-get-by-time. I hope all of you are happy in the decisions you have made.

It was nice to get out of home for a little bit I guess, but I missed everything anyway. Molly left this morning for Clemson and I missed Anne's party. But hopefully there will be other things to do in the future. 

I bought swords in Gatlinburg! Yes, Cici has sharp pointy things! ::evil grin inserted here::. They are very pretty and replicas of the swords used in The Lord of The Rings! Aren't you all as excited as I am!? Shut up. They make me smile and my father is going to help me hang them on my wall so that I may kill intruders in the night. Yay!!

I have a softball game tonight in Indiana and this weekend I'm going to Fort Knox for a tournament. After that I have a weekend off and then I go to Kansas for the National tournament. My team is ranked 30th in the nation, which isn't that bad. :-) We're ranked 9th in the Greater Lakes Region (basically Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and perhaps one or two other states, but I can't remember). 

I move into Centre College September 3. I do have a roommate which is kind of annoying, but she's a nice kid from Alabama. We'll see how that all works out because we all know how much Cici can't stand people for long periods of time.

Well, I'm hoping to start using this thing more now that we'll all be off to college. We all need to stay in touch somehow and I fear I've been lacking in my end of the bargain. And so I'd like to say I'm sorry.

I watched Drumline today for the first time. I thought it was ok, but not as good as I would have liked it to be. It just seemed very empty and unmeaningful. Perhaps that's just me, it was still cute.

Well, if any of you don't know I finally got my own computer (so excited!) and it's really cool. It's obviously for college but I get to play with it for now. 17 inch flat screen with a printer/scanner and gigapocket (which means I can watch TV on it and decord TV to DVDs). I adore it!

We have so few a number of days left to be together, and yet we spend them talking behind each other's backs and disliking everyone. One half of me just wants to tell the people that are idiots that they are being stupid and to get over themselves. The other half just says screw them, you'll never see them again anyway.

I'd like to take a moment and tell all of you a little secret. High school is over this month. After June 1, 2003, we will never again travel through the halls of UA and chat about what are plans are for the weekend. That will be over, OVER! When you look back a year or two from now, I hope that you won't look back at yourself and wonder what the hell you were thinking. Don't let petty things stop you now. Friends don't last forever, cherish them now and remember what they've taught you in the future. 

When the year started I had the impression that senior year was going to be very special. But as I see it right now, I'm going to cry at graduation, but not because I'll miss everyone, but because I feel sorry for all the people who I know will regret what they see when they think back on this year. 

Life is too short to have regrets. Change now, or suffer longer. 
Pain heals, scars are lessons, lessons last a lifetime. I hope the lessons you have learned are happy ones.

And I hope I have left you with something that you can smile about. You all have made everyday I have gone to school an amazing adventure and each one of you means more to me than I can say. It hurts me to think some of you could leave feeling hurt by others. There is time to change, if you only start now.

Love,
Cecil"

Surprised to see my name? Me too, I was just strolling around online and decided to pop my head in and see how my old livejournal was doing. It sure has been awhile.

Well, let me tell you that I had so much fun at prom! It was everything I expected (which is good). In some cases it was better, and some it was worse, but it was one of the greatest moments of my life and I want to thank each and everyone of you for being a part of it. 

In this twisted thing called life you get a few chances to change everything you've known. In one split second you have the oppurtunity to live out something you've dreamed about for a long time. Do you take that chance or do you hesitate?.............I hesitated.

I love you all

Two words that just begin the list of feelings that every person feels. But what happened to pain? What if pain is the only word in your ""emotional dictionary""? 

Have you ever felt pain? Real pain? The kind of pain you feel everytime you talk about something. And it makes you cry because you think of what you've done. The time of pain that makes you not able to look at yourself in the mirror anymore because you hate what you see? 

I have.

Have you ever been jealous of someone just because you know their smile is real? Because they know absolutely nothing of what is inside your head? Because they haven't felt the failure that you endure everyday? <i>That</i> is pain. 

Do you look at people and no longer see human beings but see a picture of what you used to be? Do you see what you wanted to be? What you are? Do you stare in the mirror and wonder what the fuck you did wrong that you had to suffer like this? <i>That</i> is pain.

Pain is real. Pain is mine. Pain is what I feel every waking minute, and there are many when you can't sleep at night because you dream of it, and so you scream about it. 
Pain is me.

You don't have the guts to tell me yourself that you have a problem with me because you know I'll give it straight back to you.

I'm SO tired of people talking about <i>their</i> lives and how kaotic <i>their</i> life is and how hurt <i>they</i> are and how much other people don't understand <i>them</i>and how other people have it easy compared to <i>them</i> and how hard it is for <i>them</i> to make it through the day without crying or how hard it is for <i>them</i> to live life without any real friends and I'm tired of everyone wanting sympathy for <u>their</u> mistakes and wanting someone else to take the blame for it and I'm so sick of everyone thinking that <i>their</i>  problems are worse than anyone else's and that <i>their</i>  problems mean something. 
They don't, they mean <i><b>jack shit</i></b> to the world and everyone better learn that real quick. 'Cause when you get out of college and you're on your own, you're gonna find out real fast that no one, not one solitary person gives a shit about your problems. They have their own problems to deal with and, in their mind, their more important than yours.

The play is going along as it should be. But it's different this year. I don't know, it's not as homey and nice. It still seems that everyone is distant from everyone else. It's just not the same and I don't like it as much. Plus the drama is stupid this year. No Nikki scandals. Although I think the new Nikki (Nikki Moeller) is going to get herself into a drama screen with Lauryn if Nikki keeps talking to Phil. That will be and interesting fight full of tears and sorrow. Whatever!

I've given up on guys. I just can't seem to find the right one. And it's not that I even want a boyfriend (I mean, I do) but I also just want some guy friends. I haven't had those in forever. There's just something very different between a girl hugging you and a guy. A guy's hug is more protective. It makes me feel better.

I had a riding lesson today and it went really well. Sabre looks really good and everyone compliments him. It's sad that I'm selling him, but it's for the best. It's the best for me, really. He's just too damn strong for me (the main reason he's too strong is because my legs are too short) and that hurts. It hurts to know that I have made him so strong that I can no longer ride him. 
Someone at play practice Saturday told me I was short and I almost started crying because it made me think of Sabre. I always hated my short legs, and now I know why.

Mike was supposed to come but he didn't bother showing up because he ran into obviously more important friends than me. He can kiss my ass.

At like 7:30 Lauryn, Traci, Molly, Nikki, and Dustin (Lauryn's brother) came and we all hung out for awhile. That made the fireworks more interesting than sitting in the sweltering sun listening to other people have conversations. 

However, by the time the fireworks started I was dehydrated and had a headache that practically made me blind. So when the booming began I had a real blast. It was awful. My sister drove me back up to Miami (I spent the night there) and I just went straight to bed. I felt awful and I still don't feel well. I think I have a cold that gives me the worst headaches ever!

The fireworks were, however, pretty.

But it's like I have a tradition to hate Mike during the fireworks. And I do hate him. I'm so mad at him right now I (yes, me personally) could spit (and you know how I feel about spitting)!

Pre-Calc - Mr. Slomer is the most annoying person on the planet! The long pauses, the rambling, laughing at his own jokes, etc.... I just can't take it. Plus he never gets around to teaching what we're supposed to learn.

Physics - I'm absolutely terrified of this class. I talked to my sis and she says Mr. Hetzel is really nice and helpful, but the class is just really hard. And well, put that on top of...

Spanish - I don't even remember this language and I'm taking it! What am I supposed to do? Hopefully I'll catch up but right now I'm working my ass off and it's getting me nowhere fast!

English - Perhaps a nice relief in the middle of a hectic day. I know this class is difficult (easier now that we have no vocab to study for) but I know Mrs. Nock and English has always been a really easy subject for me.

Evil in the Human Heart - Father Jack seems really nice, but he can't hear that well which bothers me when I'm bitchy so I'm afraid I'll get pissed at him or something. I hope this class will be pretty easy.

The Law and You - This won't be too bad, but it seems like it will have consistant homework every night which sucks.

Show Choir - This class actually went exceptionally well. Except for the fact that K.K. is a member, I'm very happy with all the girls (even Snivels) and how the dances look. Molly and Teeny are just amazing choreographers.


So that's my life for the next sememster of school! I'm going to freak. I think Spanish worries me the most because I feel so stupid, especially when I understand half of it but I just can't remember how to put it together in my mind. It frustrates the crap out of me!

I hope I don't get too bitchy with you guys, but I'm giving you fair warning right now. Because on top of all that school work I still have to ride my horse six days a week, play softball on Sundays, and director or act in the play. I mean, I couldn't make senior year any harder for myself if I tried!! Blah!!

I'll talk to you all tomorrow, if I don't explode!

Lots of love and luck on the new school year!!
Cecil

P.S. I really miss Mike. I mean, the kids like my best friend and he really makes me feel better because he tells me I can't get through this and I believe him. I wish he wasn't in Seattle, but he's happy because his job is great so I guess I should be happy for him. I just wish I could talk to him."

"event","Hey! 

It's ten o'clock at night the day before school starts and what do you think Cici is doing? That's right...her summer reading. I have finished all the books, I'm just writing the papers and stuff. Tonight I'm answering all the questions because it says on this handout that that paper is not due until the second day of class. So I'm doing that tomorrow night. Yeah me!

Ah well, better get back to work then. Talk to you all tomorrow!

Later, 
Cecil"

More wacky and crazy tests that mean absolutely nothing. Right...I have nothing much to say here. Show Choir Camp is over and it's nice to not have to do anything today. School is starting way too soon!!!

All right, I'm off. I'll talk to you guys later! See you soon.

Kisses,

"event","Show Choir Camp (SCC) started Tuesday and it is going really well! We're doing a medley from ""My Best Friends Wedding"" which contains ""Wishin' and Hopin'"", ""Say A Little Prayer"", and ""The Way You Look Tonight"". I really like the music and the dances are so cute!

So...I'm very happy with the way SCC is moving right now, but all ready tension might be growing in the ranks. A.K.A a person I shall refer to as K.K. has been rather annoying and messing up camp. Question after question after question gets really really really really really really really really annoying! But I'll get over it. We'll all have to get over it.

Well, school is starting way too soon for me. Goodness, in just a few days we'll be registering for one more year. Too soon, too soon!

Ah well, I'll talk to you all later. Sooner than we think I'm sure. Hope you have a good day. And just so you know, SCC will be having breakfast at Bob's tomorrow at 8:45 if you just want to stroll in by surprise. ;-) The Bob's near UA!

Talk to you all later!!

Hugs and Kisses,
Cecil"

"event","I saw Kathryn yesterday at Best Buy. She looked all spiffy in her shiny black shoes and her bright orange shirt! We both can't wait to see everybody back at school, but we don't want to take classes! 
Kat - We need to write silly poems in the computer lab like we did last year!! :-)

I'm starting to get nervous about my class load. 6.5 credits! Physics CP, AP Government, The Law and You, Spanish III CP, Show Choir (Ok, so this one isn't that much of an issue), Pre-Calc CP,  Evil in the Human Heart, Prayer and Spirituality, and English IV CP! OUCH!!!

But no complaining until school starts. That's my motto! haha

I'm off to eating and the good life. I'll talk to all of you later and I'll be seeing you soon!

Lots of love as always and forever, 
Cici"

"event","And far too soon the summer ends,
Soon we'll spend whole days with friends.
Laughing, learning, and all that stuff
Cheating, studying and a bunch more fluff.

And then one day the school day ends
And none of us need to go back again.
The last year done, we journey on
Knowing our memory will always live on

For deep inside every heart,
Fear of the future soon will start,
But if you just close your eyes,
You'll remember us and smile.

Never forget those happy days,
That you have created here at UA.


I love you girls! Remember that this is our last year and UA and time has just flown by. Never forget any face or any friend. I'll miss all of you so much! 

To the Class of 2003: May you always be happy and  loved. And if you ever feel lonely, just remember your days and UA and know that you are loved by all your classmates!

Love forever and always,
Carolyn Besl '03"

"event","okay, so i just read all my posts on here.  good lord.  
for any of you that don't -know- me, per se, i would just like to announce that i am not -actually- this pathetic.  eljay, if you will, seems to bring out the worst in me.  even worse than xanga, because i know the only person that reads it is adam, and i tell him all this crapola anyway.
LET IT BE KNOWN:
i am a happy, thinking individual.  this thing is not at all indicative of me, of what i'm like.
i know, i know, i've sworn off livejournal, but i really have to set the record straight here, so i'll outline my day today.

i awoke early, but only out of fear of being caught in my pajamas by the cleaners.  that always happens, and it's so embarrassing!
i called a multitude of people to find a new voice teacher in MaryLand.  moderate success.  thanks a ton, adam, for finding that woman's number for me.
i then went to buy a skirt for the upcoming funeral, as i have nothing appropriately somber.  no go.  stores closed because i had to be at my new, fantastic photo job by ten.
ten o'clock, i arrive at the davis'.  we were supposed to have a photo shoot today, but it was too chilly to be outside, so for the first time, i helped with office work.  actually, most of what i was doing was organizing her personal files and it was boring, but you know what?  not bad at all.  catherine is a very, very pleasant person (and she doesn't hate me for having purple hair.  i was a little concerned.)
while i was working, a woman called me and offered me another job!  my first payed singing work!  i'm so excited.  who cares that it's at a methodist church?  i dig jesus when necessary.  actually, i kind of have a thing for hymns.  
i worked there until one thirty, filing and chatting and enjoying the beautiful weather through the open door.  i made $28.  this new job is enough to pay for my voice lessons. :)
from there, i went to buy that skirt.  and guess what!  i did.  and it was a lot cheaper than i expected, so i bought a shirt too.  let me just say, this not wearing uniforms thing is difficult.  i feel like i wear the same clothes day in and day out.  which is really, really hilarious when you think about it.  ahem.
work was carazy!  we had tons of ""MOPS"" women in.  i had no idea what MOPS women were.  ""hi!  i'm here for my MOPS workshop.""  ""hi, i'm a MOPS mom!""
...wtf?
Mothers of PreSchoolers.  of course?
so there were tons of kids and tons of moms in the store, but we sold lots and lots of beads.  and i learned how to make a new bracelet!  it's pretty neat.
i've had to start wearing heels to work, because apparently i wasn't dressing up enough before.  (i have to fucking dress up for my minimum wage job at a bead shop?)  so my feet were killing me and i didn't get out of there until about 6:50.  oh well. more money!
so i hopped in the car and headed on home.  unfortunately, i had to eat dinner by myself, but that was okay.  adam was fantastic phone company.  then off he went to read meno or something productive like that, so i decided to be productive too.
i'm finally almost done with those stupid online courses!
so i hang out and do my work and stuff, and then i decide i'm hungry.  ordinarily i would wait until around now to go eat, but i'm having minor surgery tomorrow, so i can't eat after midnight.  
i have a minor tiff with my mom.
i think she thinks she's two.
oh well.
toddlers will be toddlers.
and here we are, pretty much.
see?  i'm not terrible.  well, i might be a little terrible.  but not quite -as- terrible."

"event","i am feeling vaguely abandoned.

it's interesting how i only feel the need to post on bad days.  i suppose not that interesting.  when i'm happy, i don't really need to look for validation (and that's really all this thing is about).  since my happiness -comes- from validation, though, every time i'm unhappy, here i am.  sitting in front of the computer screen.  my psychologist asks me ""what do you do when you feel depressed?  watch tv?  read a book?""  i respond ""i curl up in bed or write about it in an online journal.""  ""brilliant,"" he says.  ""you're thinking bummer thoughts and instead of doing something proactive to take your mind off them, you dwell.  way to be constructive.""  in some situations there is no place for sarcasm, dr. jones.  i already feel ridiculous enough the way it is.

rightfully so, i imagine.  for the three of you that read this thing, let it be known that i know what a self-indulgently absurd person i am.  i have to wonder that anyone takes me seriously.  or even -if- anyone takes me seriously.  maybe they don't.  maybe i've just self-indulge in that respect, too.

it's times like these that make me want to smash my head through a plate glass window.  it's like i don't deserve to live, but i don't deserve to wallow in whatever you want to call this enough to want to kill myself either.  i live in a limbo of pseudo discontent because i'm not smart enough or real enough or whatever it is that you have to be in order to have legitimate feelings."

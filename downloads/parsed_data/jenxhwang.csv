I have completed 30 live journal entries, and so I am very proud of myself for finishing all of the entries. I guarantee you that I have more than 50 grammatical or spelling errors, because I have done it at the very last minute. Yet again, I finished it in time for you, which I made myself to be late for class. I apologize for my tardy, but it will not happen again. I enjoyed being in your class and I did learn many things related to grammatical and spelling errors, which made me very satisfied about how I performed. I have believed that I am the only one in class writing a journal entry in letter format, therefore. I hope you found my journal entry very sweet and thoughtful so please let me pass."

All of these final test and quizzes should determine my grade, if I have at least a decent grade or not. Of course there will be a birthday party, but it will not be for me except it will be for my grandfather on my 19th birthday, because my grandfather will be leaving for his trip to Georgia and Chicago to visit my cousins this summer so he will not be present for his birthday in Virginia. I think I will have the worst birthday, because none of my family does not wish to celebrate my birthday. But of course I can celebrate my birthday with my college friends, only when they come back for summer break."

"event","My previous economics test was an huge embarassment, because I got a 60% making me fail, however truly I got an 55% for not studying in time and plus for skipping one of the most important lectures. I regret that I should have attended that class, but I was not feeling to well because I had a stomache ache that was burning insides to subatomic molecules. Since, I failed the last test its important or possibly important that I get a perfect score on the test, which is supposedly to be simple. My professor who is Dr. Jay told the entire class that she was not very pleased about the class average so she called everyone in ""la la land"" meaning, that everyone in my class were sleeping or day dreaming during class. But the truth was that, I should have came to class and took my notes which covered like 85% of the test."

There are other reasons why I hate driving that consists with waiting at long Traffic lights only when it turns red, waiting for pedestrians to walk, watching out for truck drivers especially gas truck drivers, and most of all drivers must have a strong eye for judging distance between other cars. Not only does drivers has to watch out distance between other cars, but also police men. The police catches and pulls drivers over for many excuses.

George Mason was becoming the underdog, because they started off from number 11 to being part of the Final Four which is another name for the Semi-Finals. At the Semi-Finals, it seems like George Mason was losing just by a couple of points off; then awhile later I believe the opposing team was winning by more than ten points which was towards the middle of second half of the game. In my mind I was thinking some hero from George Mason would come out and save the team by throwing shoots into the basket and make every rebound taken way from Florida. When the final four was over for George Mason, every one in my family lost our motivation or belief in George Mason, because it was a remarkable how Virginia was winning for the first time against all the other top althetic schools in America."

"event","People call me Jenny, but some of my peers call me Jennifer or Johnny.
I am 18 years and living in Centreville, Virginia. But I wish to move out of Virginia and live independently, to have some peace of my own. Therefore, I dedicated all my time on school, to do well and gain confidence for myself and my family. When I am present with my family, we usually go to a Korean Catholic Church every sunday. Therefore, I believe my religion is very scared and has significant part in my life. 
On a brighter side, I am a average 18 year old, whom enjoys spending time with my close friends from church and school. Most of the time, my friends and I go shopping at Fair Oaks Mall, Tysons Corner I Shopping Mall, or watch a movie at Fairfax Corners. But when we choose to eat in public, we usually ate at Pho Bistro or Wendy's at Fair Lakes Center.   
My peers would describe me as, shy and talkative once i have befriended with them, very active in my community and church, and very gentle."

Wow...nothing has changed in a year. I just read my last post and I am in exactly the same position I was then. Goodness...I really need to take control of my life! I'm definitely in a better position jobwise. I was promoted and feel like I am actually doing a very good job at my work. However, it isn't the work I want to be doing. I'll get there eventually. 

I was just nominated for an Emmy at work! It is rare that an Assignment Editor gets a nomination, so I feel very proud. And even if I don't win, I am just happy that our station can even say that they had another nomination in the bucket. However, the results dinner is December 1st...and I wouldn't mind bringing home a cool gold Emmy statue."

"event","So, I'm job hunting. If anyone in the Orlando/Seattle/Portland area knows anyone that works for a hospital public/media relations department, or does some type of public relations work for any charity organizations...send them my way! I am done with my job and am hoping to be out of there by Christmas at the latest. I am ready to move back to the NW, if that's what it takes to find something that I love to do. I'm tired of putting my dreams and wishes on hold for someone else. I can't wait anymore. I shouldn't have to wait anymore. I deserve better then where I am currently living. 

I watched the space shuttle take off this morning from home. This was the first launch I have seen that I didn't have to work for. It was nice to wake up five minutes before it went up and then walk out and see it in the sky. The one benefit to living where I live. Oh, and the thunderstorms. 

I had my 25th birthday last week. I think it's starting to hit me that I am getting older. It's weird...I'm not even that old. But I can definitely feel it all creeping up on me. I feel pressure to move forward with certain things in my life...like my career, my love life (even though I am no where near anything beyond what I currently have). I feel myself strugging to make more difficult decisions. I always thought everything was going to be so easy, but life certainly isn't. I'm in that awkward between stage where I don't want to take responsibility for adult things just yet, and want to hold on to my unmarried, simple life. How do you push yourself to make those next steps?"

"event","I just realized that I haven't posted in nearly four months...it's about time for an update! 

Still living in the condo. We've done lots of painting and bought new furniture to make the place look much more homey than just an apartment. We chose darker, more calming colors in the living room (burgundy, brown, taupe) and in the second bedroom, I decorated it like a Northwest room with greens and blues. It all looks good! I'm pleased.

My job at CBS is still going fairly well. However, I realize now more than ever that I need to get out of TV news. It's detrimental to my health! I'm stressed all the time, I swear I'm getting an ulcer. Something more appealing will come along eventually. I just have to find it. 

A week and a half ago, I was involved in a very serious car accident. I ended up having to go to the hospital. A man in a black truck was stuck in a lane of traffic that was backed up, he cut into my lane to get out of the traffic, cutting me off. I had to swerve to avoid hitting him, lost control of my car and ended up slamming into two cars that were waiting at a light down the road. The man in the black truck slowly drove past me (he knew exactly what he did) and then kept going. He stayed long enough to see that everyone was alive. I was trapped in my car and of course, it's just my luck that people in Florida don't have front licence plates, so I couldn't get out to see his back plate. The fire department had to come out, the firefighters pulled me out my front passenger side window. My car was totaled and I have since bought a new car. I purchased a 2005 Mazda Tribute, so I am now the proud owner of an SUV! I had been looking at this car for a long time. It's perfect for me, not too big, not too small. Plenty of room to put Oliver's house in the back when we travel and lots of room for luggage! I wasn't planning to buy a car for another two months, but I'm just glad that I'm still alive and can even drive...though I terrified to. Anyway, I'll post some photos of my new car when I am home from work. 

Everyone have a happy and safe 4th of July!"

"event","Well, I am all moved in to my new condo. Unfortuntely, Walter's current roommate has decided to put off moving out as long as possible. So, until March 10th...I am living out of boxes. You'd think since he knew three MONTHS ago that I was moving in, he would have sped up the process of gettint out. Some people are just damn lazy and it pisses me off. So I officially don't have a place yet even though we finally closed and I am the owner. 

I started my new job three weeks ago. So far, so good. It's been interesting. I can't say I'm 100% happy about the change, but it will grow on me eventually. It only solidifies the thought that I really don't want to be working in TV news. Who knows what I will end up doing, but I better figure it out within the next year. 

I bought a new cell phone yesterday. I got the new Motorola RAZR. I love it so far! I got a good deal and it came with all these extras like a carry case, car charger, etc. It's so high tech! I love it!

Anyway, I'm off to watch Desperate Housewives surrounded by boxes..."

"event","Well...I took my first big adult step. I bought a condo. Well, almost. All I have to do from this point on is sign the papers. Walter and I actually bought it together, since everything around here is so expensive. I'll be moving to Altamonte Springs, about seven miles closer to downtown Orlando, in mid-February. We signed the developer's contract yesterday and made our deposit, a BIG deposit. Now we just sign all the bank papers. Wells Fargo has been amazingly helpful throughout the whole process. I never realized how difficult and confusing it is to get financed for a home. 

The unit is two bedrooms, one bath, nearly 900 square feet and right on a lake. We can see it out the front window! We got it at an amazing price. And the developer raised the prices TODAY, since the units are selling so fast. We didn't have to pay the extra cost, but when we go to sell it in two years, we've already made $9,000 in equity! I can only imagine how much more it will cost later after we do some renovations. We're going to paint walls, replace carpet and remodel the kitchen with wood cabinets and granite counters. I am so excited! I can already tell it is going to be a good investment. 

Fortunately, my mom has taken everything very well. She was a little shocked at first, but then realized that Walter and I were going to live together no matter whether we were buying or not. Walter and I are both a little worried, but we know that we want to be together forever. We have had long talks about us and what it will be like to live together. We think we're ready and I can't wait! I'm nervous...but I can't imagine any other man that I would want to be with, own a home with and spend the rest of my life with. 

As soon as I move, I will be sure to post pictures. I can't believe I own lakefront property! Everyone has to come visit!"

And the rain...I can't even describe. Some of the pictures that were coming across the cable stations are exactly what it felt like. When I went to work at midnight, it was about 75 degrees outside...when I left work at 1pm, it was 54 degrees! 21 degrees difference! I was so cold! I went in to work with summer gear and came out freezing! I love that it actually feels like fall though!

I'm headed out to take some photos of hurricane damage. I'll post them if I come across anything good. I know the area around Disney was hit pretty hard...I think I'll head down there. Fun!!!"

I'm seriously ready to move back to Seattle. As long as I don't bring the hurricanes there! I'll take earthquakes over hurricanes, any day!!!

Funny thing about this one...I am really not that concerned. I did taken money out of my bank account, just in case the power is out for a week and I need to buy something. I also bought water last week, fortunately, before the huge rush of people. I just happened to need water. I bought Oliver extra dog food. I have my supplies from the other hurricanes that never hit me. It's that effect...like when you see too much violence and you become almost immune to it. I'm ""hurricane-immune."" No one around here was rushing to buy food, gas, or anything like I have seen for previous storms. Either everyone is ready, or they are just taunting the hurricane saying, ""Come and <i>try</i> to screw me, bitch."""

Not much going on with me. I'm finally on my weekend. I thought I was going to die yesterday, my head hurt so bad. I couldn't see straight! I was slightly afraid when I was driving because my vision was blurred due to the pain. Walter took care of me and we went to bed early. I feel much better today, but the headache isn't all gone. It's too hot to go outside...I went out this morning with Oliver around 11am and felt like I had just taken a shower, it was so humid and sunny! Disgusting!!!

I am doing some shopping today with Walter. We finally matched up our days off, so everything is good. I only have to work three days this weekend, have three days off, then I work six days next weekend. Blech! But the 23rd I am going to St. Augustine and then on the 30th to Miami! I can't wait! I am excited to stop by the station in Miami and see everyone again! I really miss it there...

Well, I'm off to take Oliver to get a haircut! And then it's my turn tomorrow. Thank goodness....a few more days and I would start pulling it out!"

"event","It's Walter's last day at Fox. I went to dinner with Walter and the production crew to celebrate. It was a lot of fun. A great group of guys. When we woke up this morning I could tell he was pretty upset. Although he chose to leave and pursue better things, it's hard to leave somewhere after four years. A group of us from Fox are going out after work too. It's an early day for me tomorrow...it's my Monday, but worth it to be there. 

Poor Oliver hasn't been feeling good today so I have spent most of the day laying with him and trying to play. I cleaned all his stuff just in case. He'll be better soon."

I am so excited for my trip to Miami in June with Walter! I found the most amazing hotel deal today! A hotel where the rooms usually run $425 a night...I got for $170! YAY!!! Not the kind of money I should be spending right now, but it'll be totally worth it. How often does a deal like that come around?

Anyway, I am going to read till this storm passes...but we're supposed to be getting them all night long..."

He amazes me...I think it's so great that he is going to take a chance and do it full time. He doesn't seem to be hurting for business! He already has a bunch of business offers for the summer. I'll just miss him when he's gone for 12 days in July. :-( But, he'll be vacationing with me in June and then again to the Northwest in September. 

I went to a work party on Saturday night. One of the weather men had a party at his house...and wow...the money that the talent makes is beyond me. Beautiful house...had a BBQ by the pool. Walter and I got there about 9pm since I had work until 8, but I had a great time. Catriona was there and I work with her every day at the desk, so it was nice to talk to her. Plus, I got to know some of the other people really well. It was nice to see TV people in a normal setting. Even though they are my coworkers, I still only see them at work. So to hang out and laugh, play pool, and watch them act like normal people was a lot of fun. There were about 25 of us there. I had a GREAT time. I am really thankful of the staff where I work. They are really amazing and down-to-earth people. Of the four news stations I have worked at, this staff is the best! My job is difficult, but the people make it worth it."

And then the following week we will spend two days in Miami! I am so excited! He hasn't been to Miami since he was nine and I'll be a great tour guide. :-) I've also never been to St. Augustine and he grew up there, so it will be a perfect trip! YAY! I can't wait until June! ;-)

My mom will be here next Monday evening and she's bringing Oliver. It will be nice to have him back. The apartment may not seem so quiet. It will take some adjusting for me and for him, but it will be good. My mom and I may spend a day at Universal Studios of Islands of Adventure. Haven't decided yet...I'm not a roller-coaster person, so we'll see which one we end up at. It will be nice to see her. It's been nearly 3 months!

Justin is visiting on the 23rd for three days!!! I haven't seen Justin since Christmas, so that will be blast! I can't wait!!! I need to make some plans!"

Just outside Reno it began to snow...I chose to drive through Nevada to AVOID snow. No such luck...

The snow cleared up in central Nevada. It was a beautiful day just south of Las Vegas, February 16th.

Shed the clothes that become my skin;
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

"event","I haven't updated in a while and I've noticed that most of my entries lately have started with that. I've had a few entries on MySpace, but this is where all the emotion is. That is really more just for fun. At least it's supposed to be. 

Let's see.... School has started and this week was a real eye opener to remind me that YES INDEED school has started again. Two tests and a presentation, then next week is the same. Then I have 2 presentations the following week. It's already getting a little crazy, but at least I can't say that I'm bored anymore. 

Moving back home hasn't really bothered me lately. Sometimes I miss living with the gang and sometimes I do miss that house, but I don't miss worrying so much about money. I still worry a little, but I think that's just in my nature.

I discovered a strange respect for someone today. Kelly Clarkson.... yea.... lol, who knew? Her new song that's out I haven't paid much attention to 'cause I thought it was like a ""Oh you broke my heart"" type of song about an ex boyfriend. I hadn't actually listened to it until today when I found out it was about her dad and it gave me chills 'cause it was like she was singing about my father and me. Now I don't know anything about her and her father and I'm going to assume he died 'cause she mentions watching him die, but I can relate to that not literally, but the fact that I watched the person who I thought was my father die. If that makes any sense. Anyway... here's the song.

""Because Of You""

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you

That damn song gives me chills just reading it again... it's creapy. Then another song I related to, but I think everyone in school again for the fall can relate to it. I did have a really great summer and I recently had one of those....too good to be true moments and for some reason this song reminds me of that.

""Wake Me Up When September Ends""

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends

like my fathers come to pass
seven years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends

here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are

as my memory rests
but never forgets what I lost
wake me up when september ends

summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends

ring out the bells again
like we did when spring began
wake me up when september ends

here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are

as my memory rests
but never forgets what I lost
wake me up when september ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends

like my father's come to pass
twenty years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends
wake me up when september ends
wake me up when september ends

Okay, after entering 3 songs in one night, I think I'm finally done. Goodnight!"

That little space inside my heart
The darkest side withholds the light
The light that brightens me inside

You don't know

Angels don't fly, they have no wings
It is another of those things
That we make up, that we believe
The real thing is not what we conceive

You don't know
I won't let you see me
I will hide, I will lie
As true as can be

To be a part of me

The light that shines you can't deny

"event","Have you ever drove for a good amount of time in complete silence, just questioning things? Have you ever just been driving and driving and didn't want the distraction of the radio or the wind... so you just roll up the windows, turn the radio off, and think? I had one of those moments tonight. I met up with Jessy 'cause we were gonna go out and act a fool, but it didn't turn out that way. I laughed and acted dumb before we went out, then the drive to Latin night we were talking all serious and then it just wasn't happening there so the drive to the beach was all serious. We just walked around and drove around talking about serious and kinda depressing shit. It didn't really help me. I think it may have helped her though. She's going through some sort of change, questioning things and evaluating things and I've been kinda going through that alot so I know where she's coming from. I guess it's normal to question so much at this point in a lifetime, but for me the questioning seems to just continue to get more and more intense and I never get any answers. I don't know how capable I am to answer them by myself either.....but I guess I'm gonna have to 'cause I've learned that myself is pretty much all I really have in the end."

"event","So I'm a little bit on the annoyed side right now...
 
1st of all, I had a frustrating day. Not so much at work, because I like what I do now....but GOING to work and then COMING home and then being home in general. The dogs are such a pain in the ass. They are so messy and so loud and demanding. I just want to slap them. They bother me more now then they ever have. The drive from my parents house to work is just hell... it was bad before, but now there is so much construction that it makes it like 1000 times worse.

Part of me is actually debating on moving back in, but I don't know if I could handle it. I wouldn't be able to come and go as I please and I'm so far away from everything out here, BUT I'd be able to save money and I wouldn't feel so taken advantage of. I got it out of Lindsey that neither her OR Brandon pay rent. I figured that's how it was, but I got it out of her. Now Paul's moving in so I have to deal with yet another person and not have my rent lowered at all. I love the house and the location. I love Lindsey and Brandon, but it's just not fair. I bust my ass to do what I do and to have what I have. I guess that's life, but I don't like the idea of me busting my ass so that they can live for free. Now I have to deal with another person. It was bad enough when the mormon moved in and her and I fight enough over the damn bathroom (1 bathroom for 5 people is too much) and I swear to god... if he parks behind me and I have to go wake him up to move his car, I'm gonna break his windshield. I hate that shit... and I'm not parking my car in the street because Brandon's car has already been hit twice from parking it in the street... but I guess that doesn't really matter 'cause he has the money to pay for it since he lives for nothing."

"event","I realized the other day that I hadn't really updated in quite some time. If I had updated as things had happened I'd have more to say. I'd have a lot to say really. 

SO many parties, SO many random make out sessions, SOOOO many stories that I couldn't even begin now... it's too late for that. All I can really say is that I've had a awesome summer. Got to see my grandparents, one of my best friends, partied nearly every weekend and every party was OFF THE CHAIN... partied in Orlando in a house a group of us rented, partied on the beach, in hotels, EVERYONE'S houses.... and we just danced danced danced.....and then danced. 

This summer was my 1st OFFICIAL hangover. I've had the headaches and aches in general... but I've officially had to puke all day, feel like I'm going to die hangover. I just think that right there says a lot... wether it be that I had a blast and the party was insane... or that I'm just insane and just had to go and find my limit, I'm not sure. Either way, it was a milestone.

I'm gonna be an auntie again.... my sister-in-law is pregnant. How exciting :)
The only really really depressing thing also has to do with my family. My Nana has Pulminary Fibrosis, which basically means her days are numbered. That one is gonna tear my UP. I was a mess when my grandma (mom's mom) died and I am far more close to my Nana. We're so much alike it's just scary. When my mom told me I was litterally sick to my stomach for a good couple of days. It took me a couple weeks to call my Nana because I couldn't talk about it, let alone talk to HER without crying. GOD that's gonna kill me. What is depressing again... or I guess just life really... is that Ayden was born right after my grandma died. I'd read that the most my Nana will live is 5 years, but with all the other health problems she has that's pretty unlikely. I realize that with every end there is a begining, but it would be nice if it doesn't turn out that way in this case.... maybe this begining won't have to have an end.

So far that's about it... I have two more weekends to go of summer... then I'm back to my crazy schedule. I'll be working full time, usually about 38 hours then taking 15 credit hours, along with trying to keep a social life. I did it last semester, so hopefully I can do it this semester without it killing me."

Nothing's too new. I finally start in HR next week for half a day and then I go back down to shipping. I like that. If I have to work in shipping I don't want to do it all day. I would have started last week if someone hadn't gotten fired. But I don't really mind working there now with her not there. Shipping still sucks in general, but at least I don't hear that annoying voice and I'm not getting yelled at and neither is anyone else. What a bitch, urgh. I feel bad for her, but she honestly had it coming. I'm just glad all that drama is gone.

Then that's about it I guess. I go to the dentist about my wisdom teeth next week and I really need to get off my ass and figure out what classes to take this semester. I've been a slacker with that whole thing this year. I think it's 'cause I really don't know what direction to go in. We'll see what happens I guess."

"event","<P>So Saturday I had a little party for Lindsey since it was her birthday tuesday........I was puking all day yesterday. Like seriously...ALL day yesterday. I'd wake up, try to drink some water, puke, sleep for a couple hours, wake up try to drink some water, puke, sleep for a couple hours, wake up, think about drinking some water, puke anyway, sleep for a couple hours, wake up and puke.... and it continued till about 7pm when Jessy came over to bring me some chicken noodle soup. How sweet is that? I've never had anyone do that for me. She had called me at around 9am after I had already puked a couple of times and wanted to work out. I was like well I'd like to, but you'll have to give me a little while to get ahold of myself 'cause I'm hurtin'. She said we'd go later, but she wound up going by herself and then came over to hang out for a little while. She wasn't there long 30 minutes maybe, but still I've never had anyone bring me over soup when I was sick. Of course I only ate a few bites, but still.</P>
<P>The party was fun. Danielle, Chad, Richad, Raquel, Bhept, Heather and Eric came over.. then when they left Paul and Sarah came over later. I drank way too much, made out with someone, and probably made a fool of myself. Right before Paul and Sarah came over I puked... and then kept drinking....how smart was that?? I remember going to my room and laying down to get ahold of myself and then all of a sudden it was 8am....and I had to puke again. I had fun, but I don't know if it was worth all of that... anyway... that was my weekend. I'm glad I didn't have to work today 'cause my stomach still hurts and I still don't feel all that great. Think maybe I might have had a little bit of alcohol poisoning? Hmm... oh well.</P>

This episode had a group of pregnant women swim with the dolphins and it was talking about how facinated the dolphins were with the women and how they would like rub up against their bellies and stuff. Then it went on to talk about a woman who actually gave birth in the water with the dolphins. How awesome would that be? I'd totally do that if I could.

Anyway.... work was very nice today, mainly because I was informed of my new job title: Human Resources Assistant :) hahaha WHAT?!?!? I'm so excited to be getting out of shipping and all that stupid ass/childish drama. I know I won't be away from it COMPLETELY, but I won't be in the middle of it anymore. THANK GOD! The only thing that sucks is that for a while I'm gonna be working both jobs so I'll be working 12 hour shifts until they find a replacement in shipping for me. I hope they don't take their sweet ass time 'cause I am so ready to be like, ""PEACE OUT BITCHES""... not that I'll actually say that, but just knowing that I could makes me happy. I know I will still be helping out in there, but I like helping out better then being apart of it.

"event","Urgh so I feel like crap... but starting to feel better then I did 'cause I got an antibiotic in me and managed to get my mom to buy me some cold medicine. Really I just told her I didn't have anything and didn't have any money. I didn't ask her for it... one 'cause I'm too proud to ask for it and two because I knew she'd do it if it was her idea. My parents are weird like that. Everything has to be their idea. Even when it comes to my education and stuff, it has to be their idea or they have to make it seem like it was their idea in order for them to approve of it. So weird....

Anyway, I have a repiratory infection, ear infection, and was on the virge of strep. Luckily my parents call as I felt like crap and got me to come over and that was my plan to get medicine anyway, so I got an antibiotic which will stop me from developing strep and will kill the infection in my lungs and ears. Thank god it's not Mono, lmao....hmmm definitely worth the sickness :)

I was replying to a comment on here about my tattoo when my mom came and sat down. She may have read it and my know about my tattoo and just kept shut...or she didn't get to read it enough to read that I had gotten a tattoo, not sure. I'm not used to having to be secretive anymore on the computer.

Anyway, I had something I actually wanted to say, but I can't remember what it was now... oh well...though I did manage to fix the picture on my may 9th entry. It now shows up. Definitely my favorite picture from that particular night."

"event","So it's thursday night, the weekend is almost here and Jessy has to work which means no wild crazy weekend... Damn that girl can party. She partied it up last night at the Twisted Martini.... damn my underagedness. She was telling me about how much fun she had and how she was like, ""man I wish Abby coulda come"" urgh... damn all my friends now being like 22-26. I'm used to being older then everyone with the exception of hanging out with my brother and his friends.

I'm no used to being the little one...now I'm called 'baby girl' all the time and Jessy even called me a Oompa Loompa from Willy Wonka and the Candy Factory, lol. That was because of my passing out on her living room floor right next to the couch, lol... with my face flat on the floor. She said I looked like a little Oompa Loompa laying there. 

She came over today. We were gonna play basketball, but we just sat and talked for 2 hours, then since she has to work tomorrow she left around 9ish. We talked and laughed and just hung out... I showed her the couple of videos on my phone and she found Alicia's ""you're a whore and I hate you"" comment to be quite funny. 

In August she's moving out of her appartment. I'm gonna miss that apartment and all the fun, but I sure as hell won't miss those damn speed bumps urgh. She's moving into a 2 bedroom/gated community appartment with a friend of hers who I've only met once, but he seems cool. I'll probably never see Derek or Michael again after that 'cause Michael and Derek are like attached at the hip and Jessy's not too fond of Derek anymore. Then Lee is moving to Gainsville to go back to school. That takes a chunk out of the group and that makes me sad. Those are my boys. I have so much fun with them. Then Hodges seems so far away. I guess it's not, but urgh... I liked the like 5 minute drive to Jessy's place. Everything's changing again and I don't like it. Our party spot will no longer be our party spot and that's very sad.

Next weekend will be a blast though... Orlando here I come...with the exception of most everyone going to pleasure island and me not... friggin' underage crap urgh. Other then that... good times, if I remember them haha!"

It's not like it was a wild crazy party... though we still had fun and I didn't kill Lindsey's mom's bird :) 

I knew it was Jessy calling this morning before I even looked at my phone. She's the only one who calls me before noon. I went over to her apartment and then we worked out. It was a really good work out. She still kicked my ass, but not as bad as she normally does. Then she wanted to go get HER tattoo since she was supposed to go with me to get mine. She's so funny. She acts like such a bad ass and she handles pain very well, but she's not as tough as she tries to seem. I was all, ""Tiffany held my hand the whole time during my tattoo, you can hold my hand if you need to"" and she's all, ""No I won't need to."" Yea... she about broke my hand off. I could tell it hurt like a bitch 'cause of her face, I thought she was gonna scream bloody murder so I handed her my hand and she definitely took it, lol....it's amazing I can still type. She got it on her foot and I've heard that those hurt like a bitch and I can definitely imagine how bad that would hurt. Now after watching her.... I don't know if I could get one there. At least she was done in like 5 minutes when mine took about 2 hours. After her tattoo, we did some shopping and made a promise to eachother to eat healthy so we can both lose weight. And as always with Jessy there was a lot of acting silly and singing and dancing. She's always so much fun, doesn't matter what we do. I love that girl.

That was about it...that was my weekend, no wild crazy partying, no wild crazy stories, but still a good weekend. Just too short as usual."

Yea well... haha very quite possible to be true 'cause you know Dean Anthony was gay 'cause she was just obvious, but Coach Harden wasn't that obvious...haha NOT ANYMORE, she was at AJ's with some girl all over her and she had this like butch as hair cut. THEN Tabatha about got her ass kicked by the girl Coach Harden was with 'cause she walked by and brushed her hand across Coach Harden's ass. The girl she was with looked back at me like she was about to beat ME up...

"event","<P>My weekend was fun as hell even though I puked sunday morning, not 'cause I drank too much or anything..... achem.... really Jessy said it's 'cause I drank water when I got up. I felt like shit when I got up and thought that would make me feel better and obviously I'm dumb 'cause you're not supposed to do that after drinking like that. Urgh... what a night that was. I had so much fun, lol. I have pictures too... Jessy and Richard got the best pictures though I think. I need to steal them. I'd say some of the things Jessy did, but I had to swear to secretcy with a few of them,lol. I will say though that I passed out in the middle of the living room floor and woke up to Michael kicking me telling me to get up on the couch, lol. I remember laughing about something and I wasn't the only one on the floor at first, but obviously fell asleep and they obviously just left me there. Then Jessy in the morning was laughing at how I was just laying there asleep on the floor. She also had to mock how I was laying which was really quite funny. She was like, ""I felt so bad, but you looked so comfortable"" lol.. oh lord. Then in the morning I was sticky from a whipcream fight and ashes from a fire extinguisher...then I know I smelt bad from puking and sweating and all the smoke. Urgh... crazyness. The only problem is that right now I'm so freakin' bored. I have things I can do, but I really wanted a day of doing absolutely NOTHING so that's pretty much what I've been doing. I'm not used to it. I'm not used to being bored and trying to find something else to do other then the things I normally do to avoid things I should be doing. That made sense to me, anyway.... Then none of my friends are around today so I'm like damn... no work, no school, no studying, no friends to go do something with, don't have to avoid things and clean... now what do I do? I did get a little antsy earlier and actually unpacked and cleaned a little, though it doesn't really look like it. I'll do the things I need to do tomorrow, I hate doing them though when I'm not trying to avoid something else. I also need to call my dentist and figure out my wisdom teeth drama and talk to an advisor. Do it while I can since I have the time off from work, otherwise I wouldn't be able to. I leave you with my favorite picture (if it works) from the night, lol.... the best part is that is her cousin, lol.</P>

Alabama was fun I was tipsy pretty much the whole time....with my parents, my mom's ex, and his wife....odd. Part of it was kinda boring, but part was fun. The drive sucked ass and I somehow managed to drop my phone in the cat's water bowl so my phone isn't working very well at the moment. I need a new one. I don't recommend dropping your cell phones into water, not that I did it intentionally, but just so you know... it REALLY messes up your phone. Anyway...Ohio... we did what we do everytime. We went to UD, bought sweatshirts, drove around, and went antiquing. We also sat around and watched the news and Wheel Of Fortune. That was pretty much it, that and sat and stared at eachother... urgh thank god Ashley was able to relieve me a couple of times. I love bonding and talking with my Nana and it's so hard to leave her, but there's only so much of that... the rest is so damn boring. Then the drive back was hell as well. I drove through half of TN and most of GA. Atlanta kicked my ass... we get there around rush hour and there were 3 accidents. Thank god I was driving though 'cause I don't think I would have been able to handle either of my parents if they were the ones doing it. I got back home around 9:30 last night and went out as soon as I got back to my house 'cause Miss Jessy was going out and I wanted to partay with her. Her and Tabatha had a bit of a tiff and I felt kinda in the middle. Tabatha was kinda acting weird though... I'm thinking she may have been on something and that would be why Jessy wanted to kill her. I had fun anyway. Jessy is having a party as her house tonight and it's gonna be a madhouse, so many people are going over there, like over 20 people in her little appartment. It's actually a ""toy party"" but it's gonna end just a crazy party after we are shown the toys, lol.  Should be interesting..."

SO, we will be there for the weekend then we are off to Ohio to stay with my grandparents. I'm excited, yet at the same time kinda dreading it. I miss my nana, the one person I've always felt the most connected with, yet felt so distant from at the same time. It's weird. There will be tears like there always are and there will be arguments like there always are with my parents and my grandparents. I hate traveling with my dad. I REALLY hate traveling with my dad.  At least Ashley's allowing me to bug her for a little while, to get away from it if I need to. That's assuming that actually works out anyway. We'll see how it goes I guess.... peace out yo."

I'm taking some time off of work which I really need, but two weeks are going to be without pay and when I come back it's gonna be the begining of the next pay period which means I'm gonna have to have 4 weeks without a paycheck.... which then translates to my being literally broke. Jessy wants to go somewhere for a weekend and I'm not exactly sure if that's gonna happen because I can't pay for a hotel room and that really sucks. Unless, somehow, she allows me to pay her back. I'd hate to ask her that. Then I need to pay for my class and hopefully only one book on top of rent and stuff like um.. food and shampoo. This next month anyway is going to be hard, hopefully it won't take me too long to catch up. I've cut back a lot since moving out, but the real world is definitely slapping me in the face because I know my parents aren't going to help me unless I move back in.... and I'd rather starve. That pisses me off too 'cause my mom gives my brother money left and right, but god help me if I ever ask for any help. I realize he now has a kid, but even before that she still gave him money and helped him out all the time. I don't understand why I get such grief about it when she's like ""Here honey, don't worry about it"" with my brother. He's a boy, he's supposed to screw up... is that it? I'm the perfect one, I'm not supposed to be asking for help? Maybe that's it. Pisses me off."

I've heard about a couple other thigns and went through my text messages and apparnetly text messaged people. I don't remember that shit. I don't remember half the shit I did. I haven't been that drunk in a long time, seriously about a year. Before we left I had about 9 shots then on the boat I had lord knows how many drinks.... at least 5, but I know it was more then that 'cause I had $40 on the boat and left with nothing. Then the club after wards I had 2 free drinks and Jessy bought me 2, then she had me sipping off her stuff the whole night. I just remember her being like, ""Here babe, you have fun tonight"".... my drink would be like half empty and she'd be like OH NO!!!! and I'd have to have another drink it was insane.

"event","Achem... so I had my group project, or the 3rd part of it due Friday and that was just hell 'cause I had to go back and redue the whole Lit Review part of it while my partner (the ONE of what was supposed to be 3) did the Methodology. That was hell to get done. Then since all my concentration had been on that, I didn't think much about the research paper and the research review I had due Monday. The weekend wasn't enough time to get those two papers done so I took off work on Monday and still finished my research review RIGHT before class. Now I know I wouldn't have gotten everything done over the weekend anyway, but I woudln't have been so rushed if I hadn't gone out Friday and Sunday.... but I needed it. I have to give myself at least one day over the weekend to do SOMETHING. Plus it was Jessy and I always have a really good time with her so I couldn't say no. We went to the Jazz fest Friday night and then to Metro. Everyone kept giving me shit though 'cause they wanted to go to the Twisted Martini and I was, yet again, the only under age one in the group... lol Jessy and ""Shut up 20-year-old!"" So mean... lol....7 months only 7 months! Metro was sooooo freakin' fun, OMG! Lol, Jessy met me in the bathroom stall with a shot of 151 that I had a very difficult time taking. It did the trick though... THEN I met this woman who kept telling me how beautiful I was and stuff and she had seen Jessy bring the shot to me in the bathroom so she was like, ""They aren't going to wonder about an old fart like me"" and then she slips off her wrist band and gives it to me. I was like YES!!!!! lol, got a couple of drinks and had a good ole time. Jessy and I were dancing all crazy and like screaming at eachother, it was so freakin' funny. I had soooo much fun. That was probably the most fun I've EVER had at a club. Wow.... 

Saturday I worked on my research paper, I had all the research done and some of the actual paper... then hung out some with the roomies. I need to stop spending money like I have it. I'm used to being able to spend like it's nothing and I can't do that anymore, urgh!

Then Sunday Jessy and I worked out. The girl KICKED MY ASS... I'm used to working out with Anna and Lindsey and I kick their asses, I'm not used to getting MY ass kicked like that. Damn... I'm STILL sore, lol. Not as sore as I was, mind you... but still sore.

Today was really nothing interesting... went to work, went to class, had to skip my lifespan class to meet up with my partner and our professor. Megan and I went to get dinner and then I went to the computer lab to do my SPSS homework. I apparently look like a computer person since in an hour period I had 2 different people ask me how to do something. I was like ""I don't know????"" but managed to figure it out for them 'cause I'm smart like that... really they were just dumb."

"event","So today I, as usual on Monday's, rushed from work to class. I walk in and there were about 4 people in there, then only a few more showed up. We sat there till about 15 mintues into the class and we were the only ones. After 15 minutes I was like peace out.. turns out class was cancelled last minute. So I went home, fun stuff.

I remembered a funny thing that happened on Saturday with Jessy. We were driving to the Humain Society grooving to my awesome system, lol, and old school hip hop when I see someone pull over and a girl jump out and run off into the woods where there was a strip of black plastic for the construction. She starts to squat and I'm like, ""Is she peeing?? OMG she's peeing on the side of the road practically infront of everyone"" There was a lot of traffic, so it's not like people are driving by fast and not really paying attention, we're just sitting there practically. Jessy starts cracking up and reached over to honk my horn, lol. She's waving and going ""YEA!!!"" at the girl and her friend sitting in the car and her friend was laughing and waving back. It was so funny. When you gotta go, you gotta go I guess... haha, I'd never have the guts to do that and I wish I had that not shy, fun, happy go lucky personality like Jessy to be able to honk and yell out the window at them, lol. Except that would make me more embarassed if I was that girl on the side of the road. 

Jessy almost brings that side out of me though. It's a side I never knew I could have. I'll never be quite like that, but it's nice to try to break out of my shell and have fun instead of being so shy and concerned about what people think of me. Jessy's had a really positive effect on me. She's helping me to be myself and find myself really. I've realized so many things about myself that I don't know if I would have realized without her. She's awesome. Her and Tara both have helped me come out of my shell a little. The two of them are actually a lot alike. I allow myself to let loose around the two of them and I don't allow myself to let loose that much around anybody else. Tara's made me realize how I hide myself when I meet someone new or when I'm in a big group. Jessy pointed out on Sat night my being quiet and I didn't realize. She of course didn't know why, 'cause she doesn't know me that well yet, but Tara would have known and Tara would have told me to stop it. Jessy would have to if she had known. I still can't get past that though, it takes me a while to warm up... but I warm up. Being slow to warm up though, might explain a lot of things.

I talked to my mom today and she said that instead of getting all my money back the like $800 she said I'd get, is now $200 'cause she changed everything and claimed college expenses... what college expenses? Last time I checked I had to pay for it all. I should have let Ashley do my taxes, but my mom had said she had it done. Whatever.... at least I'm getting some money back I guess instead of her saying that it's all hers. I can't help but be bothered by her making sure she got the most money back, didn't think about how I could use that extra money being on my own and all."

"event","Friday-
Spent some quality time with the roomies and Paul. We tried going to the Blues Fest, but by the time we got there they were already shutting it down so we went to Applebees to split an appitizer and joked about the waiter hitting on Paul and Brandon. We went to Paul's apartment and he did Tarot readings for all of us. Pretty interesting. He's studied that stuff for a while and was pretty good at it. I was impressed. He said that I have an old soul. After all that we went back to our house, I don't really remember why.. I guess so we could all ride together and drop Paul's car off at our house? We wound up just haning out at our house because by the time we were about ready to go out it was already 1am and we were like oh well... I got really tired even after drinking coffee so I just passed out.

Saturday-
Jessy called me and said that she was meeting up with her cousin and the person her cousin is dating at the Blues fest and invited me so I drove over to Jessy's house and picked her up then drove to the beach for the festival. It was fun, we looked around the little shops they had put up, sat and listened to the music for a while, had some heart to heart conversations, almost randomly drove to get tattoos (next weekend maybe) 'cause she wants another one and I still want one. Then we decided to go to the Humaine Society 'cause she wants a puppy. We stopped at the thrift store thinking it was like attached (what do we know?) Then I wound up calling Camille to ask her where the Humaine Society was and it was right next door, lol. I find it funny too that if I need to know where something is I call her instead of my own parents. She knows better and won't give me shit about it so I'd rather talk to her. It wound up being closed so we drove over to my house and I gave her the tour. We played some basketball and watched my Anastacia DVD, lol good times. Well, we ""watched"" the DVD... we really just took a nap. Then when we woke up we went to dinner and decided to go to Metro so we went back to my house, I got ready, then back to her house, she got ready, her cousin and her boyfriend came over then we went to Metro. It was fun until I got like bombarded by those weird like Armanian men who don't understand that they are at a gay club and most girls in there aren't gonna be interested. They're creepy. One of them would NOT leave me alone, Jessy had to save me a couple times. Then at one point they were circling me and like touching me and kissing my hand and urgh... I'd move away and they'd just come back. I don't understand them. Why go to Metro? Go to some skanky club like every other creep out there. Go to Plush or something, don't go to Metro. Urgh.. I can't stress enough as to how creepy those men are. I was really ready to go and thank god Jessy was too, we just had to bring her cousin which sucked 'cause she didn't want to leave and Jessy was like, ""I am NEVER bringing them again"" It took at least 45 minutes to get everyone together. Jessy would be like, ""Stay here"" to me so she wouldn't lose me, then I'd get attacked by an Armanian man so I'd being trying to get away from them then Jessy would find her cousin and lose me, then find me and lose her cousin. She was a little upset I think. It was frustrating. Then my head hurt and I just felt kinda blah.

We were gonna go do something today too, but she decided to go spend time with her dad instead. She had planned to get together with a bunch of people and go to Hanna Park or something, but it didn't work out that way. Instead I stayed home, slept too much, then had to come to the computer lab at school 'cause my computer was being a bitch. I had homework I had to print out and it wouldn't print and wound up getting deleted so I had to do it all over again, then I did the extra credit and now I'm about to leave to go put it in my professor's box since I won't get here in the time that it's due Monday. I think I'm gonna go to my parent's for a little while. I have mail to pick up and my dad talked about going to dinner. Then off to the weekly L Word party, lol. Good times... peace out!"

It's a BEAUTIFUL day, I was smilie and energetic, only had to be at work for 4 hours, enjoyed my 1st 2 classes, caught a break from my professor in my SPSS homework in Research Methods lab, went home laughed with the roomies, got back in the car to go back to school...... and BAM it starts going down hill. My sociology professor screwed with our schedule 'cause he decided randomly a few weeks ago that the class wasn't going in the direction he had planned and moved everything around. I had printed out the new schedule, but kept forgetting to add the new dates and stuff to my planner. One of my biggest fears came true today.... I walk in, in a happy, giddy mood, sit down, had some girl start talking to me about something to do with the class and I'm like hell if I know.... then I start looking around to see everyone filling out scantrons. Then the girl behind me is asking someone, ""So are you worried about this test"" and I'm sitting there like FUCK... no freakin' way... OMG... My heart just stopped and I'm like I can't believe I have a test today and I didn't know about it. I'm a dumbass... I had to bum a scantron and a pencil and guess pretty much every answer. The best part is that I remember last semester some kid coming into class and asking me if we had a test that day and since we did he was like, ""OH FUCK I forgot we had a test"" and go tup and walked out. I remember being like wow, what an unresponsible dumbass. Hmm... here I am, eating my own words. Way to go Abby, WAY....TO....GO! I guess that's what I get for not giving a flying flip about that class and skipping the last one. Urgh... Oh well, over and done with... what can you do?

No... well, I got my stuff out and read over my notes, but that was the extent of it. What did I do instead? I took a shower and then took a nap, both of which were needed so I guess it was good time off. I obviuosly wasn't too worried about the test and it wasn't too difficult for not ever going, not picking up the book, and only glancing at the notes he puts online. Lol I hopefully won't be kicking myself in the ass about that one later, but it's just so hard to go to that class... I don't get out till late and the class before we always get out like 15 minutes early so I have to wait around for an increditably boring class that I've practically already taken before. 

I'm glad I skipped the one class though 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a phone call from a certain someone... oh man, I'm like a little middle school girl with a crush... all giddy and giggley when the phone rings ::deep breath, try to sound cool as you answer the phone, you're not excited:: Lol, oh I'm a dork. But yes we talked for a little over 30 minutes as I drove to class to take my test. The best was that it was a random call... just a hi how are you call. I wasn't getting invited to anything it was just, ""what's up?"" which was cool. We've at least got a friendship going which I'm really excited about and if nothing happens then that's cool too because it will at least be an awesome friendship....and I can always dream, lol. I need more people like that in my life either way. Oh man, I've forgotten what it feels like to have a crush like this. I could just die.

We were gonna go out tonight, but since I have homework I need to procrastinate for I decided not too. Alicia might have gone with us and she wanted me to call her when I got home so I did and we pretty much just laughed on the phone for 2 hours, lol. ""I work full time........ and I have diarrhea."" Lol, oh good times... as anyone else reading this is thinking, ""What? Ew..."" lol... and of course we must always recap my salad moment and my walking through a glass door moment, then I updated her with the going through a red light moment and how ""I saw it, but in my mind it wasn't there"" The my moment for today ""Oh I'll put this candle on my dashboard so I won't forget it when I get out of my car this time.""  Then come back a few hours to a blue dashboard and a car smelling like Ocean Breeze, lol... oh lord Abby, I don't know what to do with you."

"event","<P>I'm in a better mood finally, mostly because I slept I think. I haven't slept hardly at all for the past week so yesterday all I did was sleep. I stayed up with the roomies as long as I could, but had to go to bed before the movie was over. I don't even remember what we were watching I kept falling asleep during it. When I finally went to bed I even left my lights and everything on, I just passed out. After I dropped Ashley off at the airport I came online for a while and talked to Lindsey for a while before going back to bed and not really getting up again until about 6pm so it's amazing to me that I was out again before midnight.</P>
<P>Today was probably the weirdest Easter ever for me. I'm used to at least getting together with my family and having dinner. I don't actually celebrate it, but I'm used to doing SOMETHING.... instead Lindsey and Brandon went over to Brandon's mom's house and I stayed here, ordered a pizza and have been listening to music/watching tv/avoiding homework.&nbsp;Linsdey put the animals&nbsp;outside 'cause she was gonna clean out the laundry room. I forgot that she put the bunny out there and it started to rain. Poor thing was in the rain for 45 minutes before I remembered. I had to drag him in and wrap him in a towel to dry him off. I'm such a horrible mommy. </P>
<P>I got some pictures developed and I will put them up in a few days... whenever I get ahold of a scanner, but in the meantime, you can check this one out if you have the guts...</P>

"event","Thursday night was gonna be a party night, but I apparently suck at getting people to come over since only Heather was gonna come after calling like everyone I know who lives in this area. Instead we had decided to go to Metro and meet up with Heather there, but our plans changed when Lindsey came into my room and said that Brandom and Paul wanted to go to a strip club. Unfortunatly Lindsey and I had a deal with the boys. They'd go to Metro with us if next time we'd go to a strip club with them. The plan was to go there for a little while and then still go to Metro, but the stip club sucked 10 bucks out of us from the start 7 to get in and you can't be in there unless you have a drink in your hand which immediately takes another 3 bucks off of you if you get a bottle of water. I felt pretty uncomfortable the whole time and I'm sure Ashley was as well....though Heather seemed to enjoy herself. Everyone else really seemed to have a lot of fun. Heather, the roomies, and Paul all ended up front row right up on the bar where the girls where dancing, but Ashley and I stayed back at the table. It was weird to have girls coming up to you asking if you wanted a personal dance and then having some ugly girl coming up to you and saying ""Do you want to touch my boobs for $25 bucks?"" Umm... no, thanks. One of the strippers was named Abigail which everyone seemed to find real funny. She had curly hair too which made things even better. Apparently Abigail the stripper is my alter ego while Laura the mormon from Idaho is Ashley's.

Friday night I wasn't in the best of moods. Ashley and I went to Metro and saw Derek, Lee, and Michael and their friends. They are a fun bunch. We watched the drag show and I proved what a dumbass I was by trying to give the Ray Charles impersonator a dollar without touching him. At least he was good enough to not reach out for it, but they stopped the music and everyone's like, ""He's BLIND"" and i'm like oh yea...dumbass. We watched the dating game which I was disappointed by, I've seen a couple before and they were much better. Tried to dance for a while, but Ashley wanted to leave so we left after saying goodbye to Derek and Michael and their friends since they were huddled around my car. 

We left my house today at about 6:20am. I just stayed in my PJs to drive Ashley to the airport... still not in a very good mood, but mostly just tired. I hope she had a good time. The weather sucked for the most part so there was only one decent beach trip, but I hope she still had a good time. I tried."

"event","Oh wow... I started my Spring Break off with a bang....achem

Friday night I went over to Jessy's apartment and drank.... drank a lot. The boys came over later and I was already getting tipsy. The music was playing and we were dancing and having a good 'ole time...some pictures were taken that I'm greatfull didn't turn out too good. Haha, that would be bad. We were all going to Metro and only one person hadn't been drinking so he offered to drive us all. We're driving through Riverside (why he did that instead of I95 I don't know) and we're stopped. I didn't know what was going on. There were 4 of us in the back seat, Jessy was sitting on my lap so I really couldn't see much anyway, but it wasn't until a light flashed through the window that I realized we had gotten pulled over. I'm like oh good.... I'm the only one underage and I'm the worst of the bunch. Richard (the DD) got pulled over for ""going through a red light"" and then wound up getting tickets for that, having his windows too dark and something else. I don't remember what it was. The cop makes Richard roll down the back window and I'm just like shit... Jessy's sitting there trying to like cover me and the cops going on about how many people were in the back seat. He then took all of our IDs.. again I'm like oh shit...but as I started to get my ID out, he walked off... THANK GOD after about 20 minutes and many cigarettes smoked by Michael the cop comes back to give everyone their IDs back and then makes Michael get out and pick up all of the cigarette butts along the side of the road. FINALLY after all that, we get to the club. I saw a couple people I knew, but I was a little out of it 'cause I was still piss ass drunk. I knocked some woman's beer over and wound up dancing all night with someone and making out with that someone. It was a pretty hot someone too, I was impressed with myself. It was a pretty hot someone even as I sobered up. Even Jessy was like, ""Go Abby, you have good taste."" It was a lot of fun... after my hot someone left I was dancing with the boys, so fun. I finally got home about 4:00am to wake up early to pick Ashley up from the airport and I don't remember what we did Saturday and she doesn't either so I guess it wasn't too fun...

Moving on to Sunday. Ashley and I went to Jax Beach and spent the day. I had to get my cartilidge piercing fixed 'cause it was kocked out and closed halfway. It was more painful getting it fixed then getting it done in the first place, and more painful afterwards... a lot of bleeding too.... wasn't pretty. We met up with Jessy and the boys and played volleyball...the boys won...damnit. Then we went back to Jessy's place after getting food and movies. The boys wound up in the living room watching The Notebook while the girls were in Jessy's room watching The L Word... good times. We then went from Jessy's and watching the L Word to Alicia's and watching more of the L Word. It was fun... then I had to get up the next morning to work... oh fun.

Through out the week was a lot of shopping and me running through a red light, lol good job Abby, ""I saw it.. but in my mind it wasn't there"" Lindsey's quote for me truly fits... ""There goes Abby"" I don't know how many times I've heard her say that. Hung out with the roomies chilled at 5 Points and Fuel playing pool 'cause we're all so good at that. Many U-Turns and back tracking, but with me...what do you expect. Wednesday was fun at AJs. We met up with Heather and Jessy met up with us later... and Richard also came by not too long after Jessy showed up. We danced and talked and Richard and I looked at the Kareokee (however the hell that's spelt) book for what Ashley and Jessy said was 2 hours, lol.. only to decide to do Papa Don't Preach and then to chicken out completely. Oh well. We met some fun people. I especially liked Laura, the mormon from Idaho. She was cool... you wouldn't think it, but she was. Sabrina the former teenage bitch seemed cool too, but she doesn't like being white (damnit) Jessy knows like everyone that goes to AJs and Metro really. She's just has that magnetic personality though, everyone seems to love Miss Jessy. We got home around 1 and I again had to work....lovely

Now here I am just back from work... getting ready to go to the beach again. I don't have work tomorrow WOHOO and we're having people over (hopefully people will actually come this time) tonight. I will update with the rest later. Peace Out YO!!"

Your beliefs most closely resemble those of Satanism! Before you scream, do a bit of research on it. Satanism is a religious or philosophical movement centered around Satan or another entity identified with Satan, or centered around the forces of nature, particularly human nature, represented by Satan as an archetype. To be a Satanist, you don't actually have to believe in Satan. Satanism generally focuses upon the spiritual advancement of the self, rather than upon submission to a deity or a set of moral codes. Do some research if you immediately think of the satanic cult stereotype. Your beliefs may also resemble those of earth-based religions such as paganism.

"event","I hate my Research Methods Lab... urgh... Had a test today in it and at first it went well. There were a few things I weren't sure about, but I was like hmm.. maybe I won't do so bad. Then I get to the SPSS part of the test, where we have to run the analysis through the SPSS program to find out all these different tests. I'd run the analysis and the questions on the test would all be different then what the SPSS program told me. I was like shit, what am I doing wrong and I couldn't figure out any other way to do them. What sucks is that you run the analysis and there are about 5 questions per analysis so if you mess up the analysis all the questions following that are gonna be wrong. 5 questions per analysis with I think there were 4 analysis. So... ha, it'll be a miracle if I passed that test. I can't afford to not get a least a B in this class so I'm getting a little nervous. We'll see how I did I guess. The one C I got killed my GPA so I can't afford another one. Urgh, that test just sucked.

I'm trying to rearrange my schedule at work, but it's not working out quit as I would have liked. When I thought people where there every Saturday they're not so I can't spred my hours out more to have more time during the week like I had hoped. I can do it some weeks, which will be nice, but not all weeks. I'm doing it this week though for the 1st time. I'll only be there about 3 hours or so so it won't be bad... plus it will make me get my ass up on Saturday instead of sleeping till about 4 like I have been and wasting the day horribley. The only real problem is that I won't know my schedule most of the time untill about Wednesday, which means I'll most likely not go in the Thursdays I can work Saturday. It's making my schedule more complicated, but at the same time... it's giving me more hours in the week to get other things done. I'm sure I'll get on everyone's nerves trying to find out what Saturdays they will be there all the time, but if I can get some time off during the week to work 4-6 hours on Saturday... I'm all for it. I really want to work JUST my 32 hours to stay full time."

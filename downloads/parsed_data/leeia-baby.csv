i've always known i wanted children from about the age of 3. for some strange reason living thought everything that i have just having the idea that one day i'll be able to have a child of my own who i'll love and who'll love me unconditionaly is what kept me going. knowing that one day life will grow from inside and grow and blosom into a beautiful human being amazes me still. the idea that to people can create a life from nothing visible to the human eye is strange yet amazing!

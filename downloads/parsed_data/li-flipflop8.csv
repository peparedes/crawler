"event","Hi this journal is going to be friends only.  As opposed to my other LJ, this is specifically for posting about things few people know about me; my problems and struggles.  I have always had a hard time opening up to people face to face, and have found it quite therapudic and interesting to release my innermost thoughts and feelings this way.  In writing. Hope to be able to relate to somebody <33

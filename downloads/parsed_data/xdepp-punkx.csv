"event","Wow. I was typing in that 'arrgh' and ""Are you alive?"" came up. lmao. ANYWAYS. I am so totally sick. It's NOT even cool. Like, I just wake up with a sore throat and then all the sudden my nose is stuffy, and runny, and it's hard to breath, my throat is really sore, can't talk, all that bad shit. Seems like a lot of people over here *colorado* have it. Okay, not a lot. lol. My mom had it, n now my friend Charlotte has it too. Neway..I tend to babble a lot when I don't have anything specific to say. Man, I hate it when my throat feels like this. I didn't go to school friday (today). I hope I'm better tomorrow. My grandpa told me before I got sick that we were going to do something with Derek or whatever on saturday. I hope I feel good enough to go. 

My grandpa got fired today, so we're going to sue those people. get money. have fun. lol. 

my mom and I both hate my stepdad, and the only reason we haven't left him yet is because we don't have a car. Well, we have a car but his brother paid for it so it'd be his. The money would hopefully be able for us to get a car, so we could leave him and pay them back eventually.

My birthday is in 10 days!! YAY!!

That was random. Anyways. I think that's it for now. If I decide to write more later, I shall. Because I run this journal. Not you. lol. Love ya all!!"

"event","This happened on September 3rd, but, it was awesome so I'm putting it in here because it's my journal and I can. =). My grandpa and grandma got me from school and we just hung out. Some bad shit happened with his work and their going to sue. but, anywho, derek was at their house so we went there. we were all going to go to dinner together, and like, yeah. So, I was in my grandparents car to get ready to go and Derek's makin funny faces at me through the window. We agreed on some pizza place and he's like ""I don't wanna ride alone"" so I get out and go with him. We get there, there's a huge line, so he says lets go to CB&Potts and of course, I was in his favor. So, we went there. I love riding in his car...so awesome [red mustang] and at dinner we made a deal, hence the title. lol.

Our deal:
He wants me to take band from next year til I graduate, and he said that he could teach me how to play sax and give me his sax. Well, I don't like the sax really, so I told him that. And he was like ""Well, then it doesn't have to be sax. It can be any instrument you want. I'll pay for half of it for you, if you take band from next year until you graduate. Both semesters. Any instrument you want."" I was like ""Okay then."" and he's like ""But you HAVE to be in band. And considering you like Johnny Depp so much, for you're graduation present IF you do it, I'll pay on part of a plane ticket for you to go to the next Johnny Depp premiere after you're graduation."" and I'm like ""OKAY I'LL DO IT!!!"" he was all ""I don't think you will. I know you CAN, I just don't think you WILL."" and I was like ""OH YEAH I WILL!"" lol. So, we shook on it three times. Next time I see him where we're talkin bout it i'ma be like ""How bout you buy one ticket, I'll buy one, and you GO WITH ME?!"" lol. We're going to go see the Exorcist tonight. His work is right next to the theatre so we're gonna go in there before hand and get salads. He's the 'salad maker boy' lol. Write more later on."

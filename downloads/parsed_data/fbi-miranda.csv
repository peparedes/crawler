"event","I'm PREGNANT! Most people believe that I was jus sayin that so I didn't have to fight Candace. I'm not scared of Candace but I'm not putting my baby at risk over some dumb shit. Anyways... so many people have asked me so I thought I would finally make it public. I am 16 weeks & 3 days (as of right now)! I went to the Dr. yesterday hoping to find out what the baby is but they couldn't tell. I'm tryin to figure out how to put a picture of the ultrasound on here but I dont know how. My baby daddy's name is Corey. He is Jamaican! He's very tall and skinny. He has brown skin and honey colored eyes. He's funny and crazy. But of course you know him & Brandy don't get along. My due date is September 6, 2006. Right now we are living with my sister in Palm Coast, Fl which is about 20 miles from Daytona. He's only got one more class to go and he'll be done wit school. We met at the school I go to in O-Town. He's already got his job here in Palm Coast. We are fixin to move out of my sister's house into a nice house down the road. We are happy & in love but not like everyone else in Lake City, I don't plan on getting married anytime soon. We are hopeing for a boy because I don't want to deal with a girl. Well now it's out and hope to have a pic of the ultrasound on here soon!

Holla

""My Momma""
March 18, 1948 till April 08, 2005

Momma,
I miss you so much. It seems so fake that you could be gone from me. I'm not sure how to take all this. I'm not sure how I feel anymore. I  miss you so much, Momma. I want you to come home to me. I just want to tell you so many things before you go. Just a few more minutes, please. I love you so much. You were the best mother in the world. (Betcha never thought I'ld say that, huh?) It sucks that you won't see me get married, have kids, or even graduate from college. Everyone kepps telling me that you are right here with me everday. That just so hard to understand. I can't live without you. I need you so much. I feel like I'm going crazy. Nobody could understand this pain. How can someone so close and important to you just be gone one day... unexpected? I feel like dying sometimes! I just want you back so bad. I love you more than anything. I hope you know that. I can't wait to see you oneday soon in heaven. Be waiting on me!

I Love You!
""Your Baby Girl""
Miranda

"event","I'm sitting in my Computer App. class and I'm so freaking bored. I mean I have completed all my work for the week and its only Wednesday! I have nothing to do...at all. I mean I'm literally sitting here frezzing cold with nothing to do. So I decide to say hello to all the people who read about my boring life. So ok hmmm... Sean and me have been fighting so much. Im so stressed out. I think I took on to much at one time. I mean last night I just cryed becasue I dont want to fight with him. I love him very much but I just do not know what to do. School is easy but when it comes to taking tests I'm not the brightest one in the class. I mean I pass all my labs with 100's. But on the last two tests I got a 72/c and a 36/f. Theres no ""D""s here either. So hopefully I can bring it up. I'm going to study hard for this test on friday. I really need a 100 or atleast an ""A"". I'm coming to Lake City Friday to pick Sean up or hopefully he can meet me half-way. I think it would be best for him to come here because we prob. wont fight as much. Nichole is going to Port St. Luice this weekend so Sean and I will have time to our selves. I think maybe my other roommates are going home to. That would be nice for me and him to have that time. WE NEED IT! I love him so much and we've been together for 3 years almost (off & on) but I just dont know. I just want the fighting to stop. Im stressed out becasue BJ is a bitch. I mean Im down here stressed out because of her. She got me and here ditched me. I dont know anyone. I just dont know anymore. Last night I just wanted to quit and come home. I felt like I was having a breakdown. I was crying and just trippin out. But I know that being here is the best thing Ive done with my life in God knows how long. When I move back in 3 years I will be making atleast $18-20 an hour @ 20 years old. I think  thats really good for someone whos 20. I mean I have friends who are 20 and make like what Brandy? $6:50. Amanda has a child and shes only making about that too. So I'm proud of myself and I know that everyone else is proud of me especially my mom and dad. They give me the world right now. It's crazy. I mean I think they love me more now than ever. I dont know I guess Im just tripping out. If anyone has advice on how to release all my stress let me know. Well Ive written a whole lot so I'm out.

""Hollaaa""

(Brandy: Thanks for your comment. Im so glad that we are close again. I mean Amanda has a family and well BJ is a cum swallowing bitch (lol) so its just us again. I love you very much, like a big sister, you are always there even though we have had a tiny little dumb fights evey once in a great day. But I'll always be here for my nigga. FBI forever!! The true FBI...Miranda and Brandy!!!) Quit Hatin MF Quit Hatin (in the words of LiL Jon)

"event","Well I went to Lake City this past weekend. It was fun. I drove my dad's new 2004 Truck. That was tight. Friday I got home around 5:00pm. We got dressed and left for town. Well I had heard that Chadd Brinkley was having a party and it was at Josh Jones's house. Well Sam Dunn and Kim were there and so Sam said he didn't want me out there. That was bullshit but *Fuck It* I hate him! I have never regreted dating someone as much as I do Sam. Anyways... on a better note... Friday was fun though. We saw Rachel at the Hanger. She smoked a bowl with us. LOL! We went back to Zach's house and smoked. I went home around 1:00am. Saturday was ok. We umm... hmm. I dont remember. Well we smoked and smoked oh yeah I ate shrooms. That was so cool! Sean and I got into it but thats FBI between me and him. Sunday I came home around 4:00pm. Well I guess thats it. The only thing I got out of coming to Lake City was the memory of hating it so much. I remembered why I moved away. Thank God I did. I have so much stress when I'm there. AGH!!! BJ only called me once on Saturday. She didnt even care that I was in town. I have decide that it would be best if we werent friends because she's a two-faced bitch! She can have Lovette...that fat mother fucker...What kind of friend is she suppose to be? Thanks Bobbie Jo for being a wonderful friend while you actually my friend but now you are a BITCH!

I have 3 roommates. Nichole, Anine, & Deanna. We live @ 5924 Auvers Blvd. #203  Orlando, Fl 32807. Thats my address if yall want to send me something. I already got ARRESTED! It was a curb side arrest though. They arrest you then release you right there. It was for wrectless driving. I have to go to court on July 20 @ 9:00am. Other than that it's tight down here. Alot different from the LKC. Alot faster. I should be getting Nextel soon so I'll post my number. We get internet in our apartment tomorrow. Thank God! I miss reading the journals. This is a good way for us to talk without calling and stuff. My apartment is really nice. I share a room with Nichole. There is a club right down the rode called ""ROXY"" I cant wait to go. Everyone down here says I sound really country. They think it's sweet and innocent. They dont know me yet...huh? Well its break time!

We rented a room at the Guest Inn. Jen got there around 1:15am cuz she's not old enough to go to the club. We wanted to go out to The Hanger but when we got there it was closing. So Sean and I went to Zach's. That was tight. Then we went back to the room and Sean got drunk. It was to funny. Well later today we are going to float down the Ich. River. That'll be tight.

"event","Friday was tight! I dyed my hair! It's looks normal though. It just got out all of the blond hairlights and made it all pretty much the same color now. It's cute. I want to dye it this Ruby Red color. I haven't decide yet though. AnYwAys... Friday we all went over to Daniel's house and chilled. It was alot of fun. Then Saturday Sean and me got a motel room @ the Knight's Inn room 148. That was fun. I got so drunk last night off of Paul Masson..It's Brandy. OMG! I also played quarters with beer...we all know that fucks me up! We did that first. I threw up 3 times. I feel like asshole right now. Mom gave me something and it's not as bad now. I've been sleeping all damn day. I was so drunk. I can't even explain it. So many people kept coming then leaving and then coming and leaving. I was so hungary. Zach R. brought me some chicken nuggets. I was so happy. I started to sober up after passing out in the bathroom with Sean. He was fucked up too. He was first supposed to be in there to hold my hair so I could throw up but then I was like I'm spinning and he was like don't say that. Then he started spinning and we both passed out on the floor. I woke up and my feet were asleep. I went and got in bed. Luckette fucked with Sean till he got up and then he got in the bed with me. Everyone kept blowing shotguns in my face and shit. I was so fucked up. So then everyone left but Sean and me and went to Zach and Thug's house. Thank God! I was so tired and wanted to sleep. So I passed out and woke up this morning sicker than shit. I got up @ 9:00am and came home. OH...they passed me out 2 times. Man that shit is fucking crazy. I was freaked out the 1st time. Anyways... all day today I've been sleeping. Trying to feel better.

Finally to get away and chill out from the drama of Lake City. We are going to stay at the Fountain Beach Resort. It's right on the beach and right next to the boardwalk and all that stuff. It only cost $60 a night so that isn't bad. Hopefully Brandy and David will go but if not Sean and I are still going. We will have a good weekend alone too. So it'll all work out for the best. Either way I'm excited. Sean and I are kinda talking now. He's made me realize that he'll always be there for me. I treated him so badly and yet he still loves me more than the world. Sam is with Kim now. Yes I have gotten over it. After alot of heartbreak and crying I realized that I love Sean. He'll treat me better than anyone will. I don't know if I want a boy while I'm in Orlando but atleast for right now I want to get back on track with him. Things will work out for the best. Maybe the weekend will help us fall back in love like we used to be. Well let's hope so. I always knew Sean and me would be back together and probably married one day. Who knows???

I was like hell yeah! So I went and cashed my check and then went Shopping. I called Seany B to see if he wanted to shop with me. He always helps me pick out my clothes. SO I bought the cutest pair of shorts @ Cato's. They are so short and have a cute pink belt that came with them. Brandy went and got some too. We were them out Saturday night. Every where I went my ass was hang out. Josh Jones wouldn't quit talking about Brandy's ass hanging out and I was like Brandy pull your shourts down and Ryan was like ""Miranda like yours aint hanging out too"" Oops:) Anyways.... I went over too Jonathans house and smoked with everyone. Then me and Seany B went to RJ Gator's and ate with Brandy, Ryan,Jimbo, and Janay-Nay. That was tight. Then me, Seany B, Big Sandage Hoe, and Janay-Nay went out to Andy's. That's right we went out there. Andy didn't care that we were there. Fat Fuck wanted us to leave but Andy said I'm not telling them to leave...I don't care...If you want them to leave...you tell'em. Lovette said...It's not my house so I'm not telling them to leave. But we left early cuz I had my niece with me (Courtney) and she's only 13 so I came home at 12:00am. It was tight though. Saturday was a crazy day for Brandy, Court, Seany B, and me. We wanted to float down the Ich. River but that didn't happen. It's too long but really funny! DONT forget the COP ...LMAO! That night we went to Ryan's. It was tight. Today Seany B. and me took my sister's kids to meet her in J-Ville to meet her half way from Pal Coast. Then Sean and I went shopping for my apartment. Daddy gave me money to shop for it. That was alot of fun. I found out today Sam is dating Kim...Tim's sister. It hurt so bad. I cryed. I guess if she treats him good and he's happy then good luck.  I have to move on now and handle this. I can do it nigga damn. Its hard. Sean is there for me and he'll always be there. No matter what. So it's tight. I won't see him that much anyways cuz of me moving so it'll be tight. I can handle it. I love him still but hey whatever right...*Fuck It...Might as Well* LMAO...Well That the WeekEND Review. LMAO!

(LMAO) Today Brandy and me went to lil' river...just me and her. It's was fun. We talked to these guys from Branford. They wanted a phone number so we gave them 623-2389...That's like Sam's number, except some numbers are changed around. LMOF Then we told them we'll match'em but we gotta go get a blunt. But we never came back...haha mutha fucka. It was sooo fun-nie. Tonight Brandy me and Ryan went to Roadhouse and ate around like hmmm... 8 Maybe. Anyways...It was tight except Brandy locked her keys in the truck. ""Smart One Brandy!"" Ryan took us all the way to her house and then all the way back so we could unlock it. Man It was funny. We smoked with Sam Friday but drama went on (BS) and he got mad at me. It really sucks when he gets mad at me. I hate it... it hurts. He did tell me some stuff that made me feel good. But I'm gonna keep that ""FBI"" with Sam and me. Then we went to Ryan's house and played quarters with Gin and Juice. Then we smoked a blunt...well two actually. Josh Jones was there too. He's strange...LMAO. Well I'm not sure on what I be doing tomorrow But Holla at'cha girl niggas!

"event","OK... Friday was suppose to be one of the BEST days of my life, right? Well think again. It sucked. Lovette and I are fighting because I tell on him for lieing to Bobbie Jo. I'm suppose to tell my best friend that he's doing something he shouldn't be doing. Shouldn't I ? So that made him hate me. Well now Bobbie Jo is so stuck up his ass to see that he's making her lose her best friend. The one whose suppose to live with her in Orlando. Lovette said I ain't allowed at his house so I hope he doesn't think that he's gonna be able to come into my house in Orlando. I told BJ they can go to a hotel for all I care. Tonight Andy is having a party and Brandy, Amanda, and me aren't allowed. Lovette said he didn't want me out there. MAn fuck this fucking town. I can't wait to move away. Sam HATES me. The the one thing that has made me want to move away the most. Now Lovette is a fuckin asshole. Everyone thinks me and Kyle messed around but we didn't. I'm so pissed off man. I cant wait to move from this fuckin bitch ass town. UGH... I'm losing one of my best friends. WHAT THE FUCK? Thid time I don't want to say *Fuck It*. I actually care about this shit. Why? That's unusual. I really hate knowing Sam hates me. I wish he wouldn't. I want to be friends. That's out the question. ~*~Anyways...on a happier note~*~ I graduated. It's so amazing. It's really strange though. I have nothing to do now but wait to move to Orlando on June 23rd. It was so cool. I was so scared. I was hoping that I wouldn't fall down. I didn't...thank God. I rented a motel room last night at the guest inn. You know something funny...Jen rented the same room Sam and I first had sex in. It was strange to be in there. Sam and I when we fisrt started talking stayed there. It was crazy. Brings back good memories. Last night was fun anyways though. I got so freakin high that I was high when I woke up this morning. Melissa got drunk for the first time. It was so funny. I was drunk but more high than anything. Now I'm just so drained out from all the late nights I've been having since I have no more curfew. Which I can say is the greatest. I was suppose to go to the club with Brandy tonight but I'm to tired and don't want to spend any more money. Tomorrrow I want to go to the river because it's suppose to be 93degrees outside. The best time to get a tan. I went shopping today. I got like $200 from graduation last night. It was the greatest to shop today since I haven't shopped in forever. I got the cutest shirt and flip flops. I'm getting nextel for Graduation from my daddy. I want to get the i733. It's the PHAT farm phone. It's just like the i730 but it's just got the PHAT farm logo on it. It's tight. Well I guess I'm done.

"event","Tonight is graduation. I'm so excited. I can't believe it's finally here. I'm so pissed off right now though. Lovette is sending everyone a text message saying ""Miranda is a whore...Pass it on"". I called  Sam to see if he got it and he said no and then I had to explain to him what was going on about Kyle Scott and then he hung up on me and said ""stop calling me bitch"". It hurt so bad. I cryed my little heart out. I never knew he could have such an impact on me. I still care about him more than I thought.When ever I hear a certain song like...""Burn"" it kills me. I just want to cry. Then yesterday I was rolling a blunt and Sean said ""You roll a blunt just like Sam"" . I was like Whoa. That is true though because Sam taught me how to roll a blunt. It just made me miss him so much. The other day when I was going to deliver him some ""speakers"" I was so scared. He was wearing my favorite red shit. I was wearing red to so we would've matched. He's so mean but I can't seem to get away from him. I don't want to. I don't know. This shit is all fucked up now. He probably wounldn't care if I died tomorrow. UGH... Anways.. I hope I have fun tonight! I want to go buy some vodka and get fucked up. Brandy and I are going to hang out I think. *S-I-N-G-L-E* really spells *T-R-O-U-B-L-E*! BJ, Jen, and me bought John Deer shirts today and got our names put on the back of them. They are gonna be so cute. BRANDY... needs to go get one. Well I guess I'm threw...(LMAO)

"event","UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: This week has been so much fun! I thought it was going to suck but it hasn't really unless I think about certain things or hear certain songs. Other than that I've had fun. I've been smoking an awful lot latly. A lot of shit went down here at the heizy. I'm cool though. I thought that if I ever need this one person he would be there because I would ALWAYS be there for him but he WASN'T! It's ok though... that made me change the way I think about that person alot. *Fuck It* It's cool. I've been chillin with Sean and Candace alot. Sean really cool. He's so much easier and funner being around when you're not dating 'em. We all went to the river the other day and I got to ride on this guy's jet ski. It was fun... he even let me drive it. I knew how though casue my Grandpa has some at their lake house. It's was so much fun. Luckette is so crazy. She knew everything about Branford. OH...(something funny) Luckette left Sean's keys on some guys we meet's boat. Sean went NUTS. I thought it was funny. I was drunk and high man. I was like...Fuck It. I guess since I'm graduating Friday (Thank You) she letting me decide what and when and where I'm going and coming. I love it. This is the earliest I've gotten home all week. I love it. *I miss my daddy.. he don't live here anymore* Anyways... Tomorrow is graduation practice @ 9:30am. What are they thinkin so early. It's tomorrow and Friday. But hey that's cool. I'm going to the river afterwards so it's ok. Casey had me sell to SAM D. today. I was like damn nigga call me out. Talkin bout Miranda will bring it. I was like hmmm how fucking convenient. So I brought it over there and he well Stephen only rolled the window alittle down so the money could come out.. I was like what the fuck. He rolled it down all the way and Man I was pissed. I wanted to leave and say fuck it you must not need ""speakers"" . He didnt buy it anyways cuz it was small. I knew he wouldn't I even told Casey that. I didn't even want to talk to Sam after that shit but I guess it's cool. It kinda hurt because I know Sam and Stephen were talkin about it when I left or when I walked away probaby. I know how he is but I don't fucking care. *Fuck It* No biggie to me. Well I gues I though :) 

Miranda out this... BITCH

I do know that I can't wait to move to Orlando. I can not wait. I hate being here. There is so much drama around me and in my fuckin life. Friends fighting... I'm breaking hearts... and breaking my own. My life is so freakin crazy. The only thing I can be happy about is I have 2 days of school left. Thats right 2. I can not believe it. It's so crazy. My life is moving ahead so fast. Everything is *JUMPING* out at me. I got my first graduation present today from Matt Dupree's mom.. Val. It was from their whole family I just said Matt so you would know who I was talking bout. They got me luggage so when I ""run-a-way"" again. (LMAO) That's what she said. But it's really for when I move away. **AnYwAyS** My parents are going to Orlando Thursday and won't be back till Saturday Night.I'm so happy they are leaving...YES!! No parties at my house guys(Brandy). Baccalaureate is Sunday. I'm not exactly sure what it is but I'm going. *Fuck It* Well I guess I'm out. Holla at'cha Girl.

NOW they are at each others throats. *WHAT DO I DO?* I hate that we all can't hang out with each other now. Well we can but it's just to much Drama 4 yo momma. I  hate how they both talk to me about one another. I guess it'll all work out in the end. Friends shouldn't fight over a guy. As long as both of them know that I love them no matter if they hate each other. BRANDY.. you are *FBI* no matter what. We started it and we'll finish it. AnYwAyS... I got so fucked up yesterday. Bobbie Jo and I played quarters with beer. She was kicking my ass until I got the hang of it. Then I kicked her ass. Then Brandy came over..WOW. Then Janay and Ashley B. came over and Janay played with me while BJ was fighting with Lovette. I got so fucking drunk. I can't not even explain it. I don't remember alot of shit man. Then I smoked with Sam, Stephen, and Nikki. I had alot of fun. *OH YEAH* I can't decide what I want anymore. I'm finding out that I care way more about Sam than I thought I did. I told Sean I don't want a relationship with him. He just don't understand how *I* feel. I can't help it man. I guess it'll work out.

"event","Well where do I begen? Well Sam saw me and Sean at the store by Lovette's house. I was buying green but I didn't tell Sam what I was gonna do. So he drove by and saw us. He brought all my shit to Lovette's house and left it on the door step. I didn't realize how much it would hurt me to lose him. Sean is pissed because I don't want to be with him either. So right now I'm having problems. I also lie to much. I think I'm some kind of playa. I really need to quit. Like people say I think I'm a queen or something. I really wish I could go back and change so much. I don't know what I want anymore. I do know know that I can not wait to move to Orlando and leave this drama filled fuckin town. Less than a month away now. It's crazy. Oh anyways back to my weekend. Friday I went to deep creek and that was ok I guess. I was really pissy so I didn't have to much fun. Saturday we went out to Cw's party and that was ok. It was so hard to see Sam. I wanted to leave so bad. Then I came home @ 1:00am. Today is mommy's day. We went and ate at Cedar River Seafood. I hate seafood. So I ate a chicken salad. Now I'm home. Bored. Trying not to think. I really need to think about whats going on in my life. I have to much drama.

I woke up at 1:18am and was supose to be home at 12:45am. I got home at like 1:45am. But no one was a wake so they didn't notice. Saturday I went out to Amandas and got fucked up. It was so funny cuz Brandy was throwing up every where. I was yelling at her saying"" throw it up bitch"" everyone was like stop and I said ""Hell no If this was me she would be yelling at me too"" I told her bout it the next day and she said hell yeah I would be yelling. I was like yeah I know you would be. I have had her in my ear plenty of times yelling throw it up bitch. Anyways SaturDAY we went with Katrina and Crystal to little river. Crystal had her baby with her.
She is so cute. Trina brother came too with me, Sam, and Stephen Collins. We had fun. (This was during the day time) Well I had an over all good weekend. Hope every one else did too.

I probably leave on the 23rd though. My 18th birthday is June 20th so at least I'll get to celebrate that with my girls of the LKC. Well I can't seem to hold my eyes open any longer so I'm out.

I don't care if people hate on us in here but don't be doing that shit to my motha fuckin pictures. If I find out who did this I'm going to beat the fuckin shit out of them.

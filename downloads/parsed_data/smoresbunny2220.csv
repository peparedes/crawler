"event","hey! i havent written in a long time so i have a lot to catch up on...ok well theres only 2 more days of school and that is soo awesome!!! i love exam week(not the actual exams of course...) im soooo done being a freshman it was probably one of my least favorite years school-work wise, but being with everyone i have known and gotten to know was super awesome--thats the only thing im going to miss about school! i had my first horse show a couple weekends ago and i did terrible!! i got a second, a third, a fourth, and a fifth...now that doesnt sound too bad until you hear that it was out of 5 people! i guess i was just really nervous and wasnt paying attention like i should have been.  my next show is next weekend and i dont feel ready at all!!! but im sure it will at least get better- im going for reserve champion this time!!!! memorial day weekend we went to my uncles house and we brought chloe.  my cousin carly just got a new horse and he is super cute. anyway chloe used to have long hair, but the people who had her before us didnt groom her so she was super matted underneath...i bet you like where this is going huh?  well we spent like 5 hours off and on shaving her with horse body clippers because they kept overheating and chloe didnt like to sit for very long. so now shes shaved!!! she looks like a schnouser now and we couldnt put a bow in her hair anymore so we had to get her a bright pink collar with rinestones in it so people would know shes a girl! its so cute!  we taught her how to shake and stay and shes getting much better with come, sit, and lay down so thats good.  daisy is also comming out a little more now.  oh yeah and since shes been so scared of the dog, she hasnt been grooming herself so she got all matted up so we couldnt brush her anymore sooo....yup you guessed it, she went to the groomers and came back shaved! she looks so wierd i hope no one sees her like this ;)man we are shaving our animals left and right! no more shaving for the giardino family, except maybe my dad...
well i believe i have bored you enough for one day, id better go start my math hw now...."

"event","<P>ok well now i have my puppy and i do love her very much but... when i said she was a quick learner....well i was kidding about that -- she doesnt come when shes called much, she poops and pees all over the house and who usualy cleans it up? me.&nbsp; she chases the cats like shes going to eat them... i dont even see daisy that much anymore and she attaked smores last night!!!&nbsp; she sometimes bites when she is sleeping and someone tries to pick her up too... not that its too bad because she is still a puppy, but that really needs to stop. she also wakes up at 7:30 every morning so thats when ive been waking up-- during break.&nbsp; so i think im just tired.&nbsp; i know i wanted to get a dog and i still like having one, i guess im just feeling like thats all i do: make sure the dog is alright, not making a mess or terrorizing the cats, and happy.&nbsp; ugh!&nbsp; im sure it will be fine after she learns some stuff about living here and calms down a little.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

"event","omg im soooooooooooo excited-- this tuesday i finally got my puppy!!! her name is Chloe and she is a schnoodle and shes 7 months old and shes gray and white and i love her so much!!! shes pretty smart so shes learning stuff pretty fast and shes really friendly.  im going to get her a hot pink collar with rhinestones on it because the collar she has now is black....AND SHES A GIRL!! whats the world comming to?!?!?!?!?!?  right now my parents have a bunch of their friends over and they all have like millions of little kids and it is soo loud! at least its warm enough for them to be outside, otherwise i would probably just die! but now some are leaving i think... yeah so now i have 4 pets, that seems like a lot to me and i think it will be fun if the dog and cats get used to each other...at least i dont have to worry about the bunny getting used to her-that would be bad.  ok so now im just rambling on and on, i better go see whats happening outside...."

"event","wow this weekend was sooooooooooooo much fun!!  julia carly and i made jamie a cherry pinata for her party and to ended up looking really good(and we finished it).  so we put about 20 hours of work into that stupid thing and, no, we did NOT break it!  so we went to the party, which was at the holidome, and ashley, julia, and jessie came right after carly and i.  first we wanted to go in the pool, but some people were having some issues getting ready ;) and that was pretty funny.  then we opened presents and ran around the hotel like maniacs for a while!  which is the best part!!!!  omg rob g-blah-blah was there and he was very creepy.  we swing danced, and ran around more, and kept and eye on the little hoochies(mary and her friends) and then everyone went swimming again except me and jessie.  when we went to make sure everyone was still there we saw this little boy crying and shaking so we walked by and figured that he had fallen on the treadmill and gotten massive treadmill burns so we went back to see if he was ok because no one was helping him before that, but then he was with his mom when we got there so we felt mucho better.  then we went back to our room and got into our pjs and played a bunch of weird games and then one half of the room went to sleep and julia, ashley and i stayed up two hours later than everyone else untill 3:30...we did palaties hahaha.  so ya then we woke up at 10 and ran around for two hours, in which we did lots more fun stuff, and carly and i left right at 12.  then i came home and watched fairy topia...good barbie movie i would recomend it if you like barbie..."

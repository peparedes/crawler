I've had this one since I was fourteen, so I think it's time for a change.
I'll be adding people, but let me know if you want to be added/not added anyway =)."

i don't know where my head has been.

i'm sick and will probably spend the weekend tucked under five or six blankets and not getting any better just like i always do when these horrible sicknesses attack me and never leave!

i think that everything will be okay. i think that life will be just fine."

finished <i>Choke</i> last night. it was very good, but i think i liked <i>Invisible Monsters</i> a little more. which is odd because most of the reviews say otherwise. nick suggested reading some of his nonfiction, so that'll definitely be on my list.

now i have to read <i>Light In August</i> and <i>The Tempest</i> for school in the next three days [ yay, procrastination ], but other than that i have a few more i'm waiting to read. i still have to read <i>Deception Point</i> and <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> and then i think i'll borrow some Kerouac from chris and read some of his stuff. i want to up my 'books read' number this year, so i'm going to keep track! hopefully actually having a list will keep me actively reading =)!

<b>i need more book suggestions!</b> i have a $50 barnes and noble gift certificate and nothing to that i still need to buy."

I've been thinking of the story of Peter Pan. Everything seems perfect and so desperately picturesque. A world where children would stay children and there was no one to destroy what they had; no one would take their childlike hearts and their happiness and their innocence. They were lost boys, but together were they really lost? But, even with an island containing only things in their fantasies, it went wrong. Peter Pan was wrong - the one who was supposed to be their leader. It seems that when things weren't going his way, he wasn't the carefree, gentle, innocent little boy the lost boys had thought he was. Where did their whimsical paradise take them? 

Sometimes I fear that in my search to not grow up and my search to grow up at the same time, I'm going to be so focused on my two conflicting tasks that the memories and lessons will pass me by. Every time I try to slow down and rediscover items such as my imagination, all of these horrible, horrible things try to creep in like grammar and bills and life. 

I hung out with Jordan, Brian and Rickie last night. It's always strange hanging out with people you don't see as often and the differences between them and your group of best friends. While I love Brian and Jordan dearly, it is most definitely different. Whenever those awkward inbetween conversation topics silences confront us, it's actually an awkward silence. I can guarantee you those either don't occur, or they don't matter when it is me and all the people that I see the most. It's strange when discussing what to do, you're not sure if these other people will approve or if they'll think something is silly and it actually matters. I am hanging out with them again tonight, though, because I think it's time for me to look outside of my theater cave for friends. I know the whole theater cave term is a big joke and all, but it's sad when you really look around and it's true. I don't want to confine my high school experiences to one room, nor do I want to confine them to one group of people. I used to be so proud of the fact that during 9th and 10th grade all of my friends were <b>very</b> different from one another. Now all of my friends are theater kids. ""<b>Don't put all your eggs in one basket.</b>"" Well, I think that's good advice, especially considering how much drama really does happen in theater. And when problems erupt, everyone just lingers and wallows in all of this horrible muck that's surrounding everyone. I know that can't be healthy.

I think I'm going to see Juno this afternoon with Chris and I am quite excited. Maybe that will let me forget about my head for a while."

I got my New Year's Kiss. I'm happy. 
::/edit:: 

I went to the zoo today with Chris and his family [pictures later] and it was nice. His family is so radically different than mine, it's strange, but definitely nice.


I hope everyone had the best 2007 that they could have. I hope that everyone enjoys 2008 and makes the best of the entire year, beginning to end.

I love you guys and you've all made this year one that I'll never forget and for [mostly] all the right reasons! It's been a year of firsts and a year of lasts, as well. I can't wait to see what the next year holds for us all."

Sometimes I wonder how impossible it is to be happy when you grow up and have bills to pay and a job you hate and family problems. 

Although that is a very general statement, doesn't it seem too entirely true? I was sitting and thinking about how many adults I knew that actually seemed happy and I counted two. And one of those people I wasn't too sure about. 

It is especially sad when my current teenage life is so very happy, but I feel like the chances of me holding onto that are so slim. I need to regain some positive vibes. Does anyone have any positive vibes and can be around?

I'm scared to allow comments anymore. Isn't that sad? I believe it is. It makes me sad when you can't trust human beings. It seems like we're all just so rotten inside sometimes.

But hey, I've had a wonderful Christmas break so far and I hope you are having one, too =]. If anyone needs a ride or to borrow a few dollars or some freshly baked goods or a hug or anything just let me know. I know I'm kinda lame with being a friend most of the time, but I really do want everyone to be happy even if they aren't my ""friends."""

Christmas time sure did approach quickly. December in general came and went and for the most part, I'm happy about that. Every month isn't really November or December, it's turned into just one more month until I get to leave.

That's terrible, isn't it? I don't even know where I'll be going to school and it doesn't matter - I just want to go. 


Christmas time plans:
-today is my Dad's Christmas party, but I'll be out to dinner with Chris as we have been together 11 months as of today =]
-tomorrow I'm saying goodbye to Chris [he'll be in L.A. with his family for Christmas] and then over to my mother's side of the family. 
-Christmas morning will be spent with my dad's side of the family and <b>then</b> a group of non-Christmas spirit folks and I will be actually enjoying ourselves.


So today there will be hustle and bustle, but afterwards it'll be back to winter break and back to reading for unhealthy amounts of hours and back to life without school. 

Merry Christmas everyone."

Chris always beats me when we're on freerice.com, so I've decided I need to work on expanding my vocabulary. Maybe I'll get one of those ""learn a new word a day"" calendars for next year.

In six days the only affiliation with theater that I'll have whatsoever is Thespians, and only because it'll be my seventh semester/inductions, so I feel it would be silly to stop being involved now. I think it was a good time to leave, if anything I think it was my time to leave a little sooner. 

<small>(For all of you graduated theater kids, or present theater kids for that matter, please don't tell me I'll regret it or anything of the sort. I'm honestly fed up with people trying to understand what happened these last few months.)</small>

Excitement still fills my body when I think about moving away this summer. 

I've decided I want to help people for the rest of my life. Maybe that's a little general, but if I've spoken to you about my specific career paths I'm considering, it makes a lot of sense. And gosh, there is this fairytale of a volunteer program in India that my heart is yearning for to a ridiculous degree! I want so badly to put off college for a year to pursue that instead, but I try to remind myself that I have lots of time for foreign countries :)!

And that is all. It was a strain to even write this much. I'm just trying my best to keep my Future Self updated."

i forget how much i forget to update this.
i have no creativity at the moment so i'll copy over what myspace got a few weeks back, instead:

-----

i've written before about my lack of passion. it was last june when i ""graced"" the enigma that is myspace about it, i believe. now it seems my passions have changed dramatically. they used to be action based, and when they weren't that's what they yearned after. now they're just these trivial afterthoughts: my ecstacy resides in the knowledge that in only a few months the sole stimulant of my happiness will be myself, my satisfaction is resting in the arms of my lover, my euphoria is occupying a sunday morning with wonderful scents of chai tea and a mix cd with music so good you wanted to cry flooding a softly lit living room. so, i have happiness. i have it completely in my grasps, but am i sure that i want to stay in this safe zone? am i okay with my passion being contained to my few known creative outlets and sticking with things that i already know? what happened to letting my desires free to explore? i want violent outbursts of agony! as silly as that sounds, i've found time after time that sometimes when you let your heart guide your life without your mind that while sometimes you <b>do</b> get afflictions, sometimes you also find new levels to living. goodness, what if i never let my heart lead my mind and overall conscientious nature last winter? i would be much more apt to fits of fury and anguish and dolor than i am now. i want violent attacks upon anything mediocre in my life! i want black eyes of the heart that shake things up a bit. i want some hit and misses, damnit. i refuse to stay in my little patch of life just because i'm happy. i can still be happy and i can still keep all those things in my life that keep my heart so full while still pushing spiritual and mental and emotional boundaries. who cares about composure and moderation and all the things that make up every american's bullshit mediocre dream when you can push yourself to the edge of true quality. i want substance! i don't want anything concrete to tell me i'm happy. i want the pure essense of phoenix and transcendence and choate and all these other words that no one's ever heard of and you want to know why? because no one ever goes past the limits that aren't even really there to find a use to those words! i swear if i never hop on a plane and if i never spend months and hopefully years in another country doing good for other people, i'll consider myself just as mediocre as every other apathetic face in a business suit on their way to work.


i don't know why i end up in these little fits.
seven more months, seven more months, seven more months.
did i mention how much i can't wait to leave monte vista and its repetition?
seven more months.

You'll have to ignore how ridiculously crappy these pictures are. I was just running around trying to snap pictures and not taking any notice as to if it was in focus or not.

There was a medium toned, wrinkled woman waiting at the bus stop. One road led to entertainment and cinemas and opportunities to buy things she probably didn't need; her road most likely led her to an equally happy and wrinkled husband waiting to greet her with open arms and a grown love. Another woman, young yet, when she smiled, you knew that she has enough love in her for years much further than her age. However, something peculiar happened. When the young woman sat next to the older woman, she opened her mouth and said something along the lines, I would assume, of ""How are you today?"" The woman with her dark clothing, aged as she was, did not return the smile or even reply: she simply sat aloof to all around her. 

I made up the reason for her reaction in my head. For it is what I would like to be true. Her heart really was full of love, even if the young woman could not tell. Her heart has just grown to be protective and to only let her deep, meaningful love open up to very few people. She knows if those few people know what her heart looks like, then it's okay. It's okay. 



No one understands my heart anymore. It hurts my soul. It's apparent in my smile and in my face and in the way I say hello and in the way I say that I'm doing good when someone asks. Do those very few still see that there is still immense amounts of love in my heart for them? For everyone, it's just that everyone isn't allowed to know for that is just too scary. It's okay though, right? It's okay?"

Well, I really don't ever know what to update everyone with on this anymore.
The only reason I write is because I know how much I enjoy keeping up with people's lives through LiveJournal. So, I guess the conceited part of me likes to think others enjoy the same of myself. 


Though, what is there to say? My social life resembles that of an elderly woman more and more each week. My friend count is dwindling, while my tolerance gets lower and lower. Chris is as present as always. We are as good as you have read in entry upon entry. Books and blankets and nights in are becoming my only sources of entertainment. The only seemingly strange part is that this is what I've chosen.

What is there to say?

I'm good; I'm very good. I am sorry: I'm sorry that I'm not the person to call up for a fun night out anymore. I'm trying to learn from the little time I have left in San Diego. My heart is still yearning to move on, however.

I would much more like to know how everyone else is doing <b>beyond</b> the LiveJournal posts."

My life is in one of the biggest stages of confusion it has yet to see.


<b>I.</b> I don't know where my self-esteem has gone - appearance and personality wise. It is strange how much of my personality is evaporating when I am consistantly conscience of myself.

<b>II.</b> There is a ridiculous amount of anger and bitterness in me aimed at mostly everyone in theater. 

<b>III.</b> Mrs. Oakley and Mr. McClure made my day! They made me feel almost...honored? by the way they spoke of my personal statement they read today. For once in quite a while I felt proud of myself. However, that was followed my complete guilt at the fact that I wrote the personal statement at three in the morning the night before it was due. Uhm...woops? 

<b>IV.</b> I've been getting these awful migrains that I keep playing off as headaches to anyone that asks. I'm trying to figure out why they've been triggered, because I swear as soon as I think I have control of them, they fire back at me."

I know I've said it over and over, but I cannot wait to leave! 
Goodness, everyone around me is talking about how much fun this year is or how much they'll miss their friends when they leave or how they want to stay in San Diego or how they can't wait until Prom or this or that. 

Honestly, I just want to reply with a very forward, ""What the fuck?"" 

While I'm having fun with friends on the occasional weekend outing and while every now and then something fun happens during school hours, it is serving as no motivation for not wanting to leave immediately whatsoever. Now, I figured this was normal, but it seems as there's very few people around me who feel the same. 

Be patient, be patient, be patient. 
I'm trying. 
Only ten more months is my daily anthem to get me through long hours of scatterplots and analyzing poems and variable goods and ionic compounds, not to mention the teachers and narcs and nearly every adult in the facility treating you like a small child, because the majority of the school acts as such.

Monte Vista's only purpose has continued to stay the same: giving me more and more enthusiasm and yearning for college each day. 


A little under a month until the play opens. I cannot wait until it's over, simply cannot wait. This has been the supremely worst play I've ever been in and it almost makes me angry that the only reason that it has proven so horrible is because of what people said after casting.

Anyways, there hasn't been too much to say, as readers can tell from my digresion from updating LiveJournal. [Sorry about that.] I do enjoy reading the very few who still update, though!

That resulted in lots of pictures of Layah, as you can tell.

The problem with me bringing my camera places is that when there's nothing going on I take pictures of boring items.

-a retake for my awful senior pictures!
-a nice bagel
-all sickness to disappear [and actually stay gone for once]"

I keep doing that thing where I write a million posts, yet never actually post them. 


Ms. B wrote me a story to cheer me up about the whole theater thing [explained in a friends only post earlier] called ""The Giantess and The Zebra,"" don't worry if you don't understand the title, and she wrote Chris into it =]. It was the cutest, most perfect story I could have asked for. 

Eight months with Chris is on Sunday. He has just been such a wonderful aspect in my life. I love how we inspire each other to be better, it makes me so happy that we don't let the other settle for mediocre. There's love and hope and faith in things that I've never found them in before. 


I wish I could put everything and everyone I loved and put us all on a plane and wisk us away from Spring Valley. The more into senior year it becomes, the more I cannot comprehend why people chose to stay here. If it's stricly for financial reasons, then of course, there's nothing anyone can do. I can't help feeling the same way about senior year, though: there hasn't been any mass amounts of fun, there haven't been any learning experiences, except maybe that everyone sucks and that when one person really wants to make your life miserable, they get a lot of people to help them out.


Rehearsal exhausted me yesterday. It was emotionally draining and now it is a gloomy day, and working is the last thing I want to do, though it is my second to last day. Oh well, at least I have memorizing lines to look forward to afterwards -_-;;"

So, this one day I did the most dangerous thing I've ever done while driving. 
Note: I was by myself in the car.
I took pictures without looking and while still driving the moving vehicle and this is the only one where I didn't miss or it was boring, basically.

I went to Chris' house one day, but he wasn't giving me any attention because he was doing silly things like ""homework,"" so I had to entertain myself.

Another day we [the whole group] went to see Measure For Measure at The Old Globe and it was quite, quite good. 

Brittany and I looked hot, our faces in this picture, however, hahaha, they were not.


I was rocking the Shakespeare look with the ruffles and tights and Brittany was rocking the ""I'm extremely good looking"" look.

I'm pretty sure this is the most depressing picture I've ever taken and it was completely by accident.

I hate working.
Why am I working?
There's zero doubt in my mind that the money is not worth it whatsoever. 
There's quite a bit saved from these last three months.
I need to grow some balls and quit.



Uhm, other news...other news.
Rehearsals start next week and I am thoroughly excited, even though the cast list was rather...disappointing, in ways no one would understand.
I can't wait until choir starts doing solo concerts!
I have seen my boyfriend who I love so dearly less than two hours this entire weekend, because our work schedules literally conflict that awfully, just as they do every weekend, because every weekend we work the same hours and every weekend we don't see each other. 
Christina made me a mix cd and it included the current song I'm listening to and I've come to love it quite thoroughly. 
Apparently when you do random acts of kindness they give you horrible karma? At least that's what I've found lately. 

Seriously, my LiveJournal has become so full of superficial updates and ridiculously pointless notes."

Hmm, what to say.

Classes have been okay. Oakley and Trim are both new and as good as everyone says. I have feeling McCormick will quickly become one of my favorite teachers, though. He just seems really rad to me.  Copeland and Muhleman both have good personalities, but their classes are going to make...well, a very long year. Leclair and Ms. B are as amazing as they have always been.


I freaking love my group of friends so unbelievably much this year. It really astounds me how I became this lucky. The drama kids aka Chris, Brittany, Andrew, Dayne, Judy, Rickey, Michelle and Bianca with some others, also, but I would say they make up the main component. They are just so unique and so in touch with themselves and so carefree and oi. There is honestly just so much love radiating from me in their general direction. Freaking astounding.


iTunes deleted all of my music. All. of. my. music. Work is lamelamelame. Only two more days of practice until auditions! Chris and I's work schedule are designed to keep us apart. 

The end."

I feel like everything is building up to something, waiting for a big finale.
There's just so much <b>new</b> now that school has started. 


1. Less nothing and more everything.

2. Productivity and enough sleep and all my homework being done.

3. Want to hear my <b>favorite</b> rumor I've heard in the five days I've been back at school? ""Oh, so you I hear you kicked Kourtnie out of your house because you were jealous of her."" That is tied with the new rumors that specifically annoy me because the message has been conveyed to my teachers by someone that I have created some kind of Anti-Kourtnie group that I am leading and I've told them all not to talk to her and that I throw my wrath at anyone who does. Doesn't that just sound like me??

4. I have dance, choir and theatre and that makes me feel supremely dorky.

5. The play auditions are next Thursday! I am thoroughly excited. I'm trying out for Hamlet and I'm trying to stay positive and just work as hard as possible to make it happen.

6. Work is super, super blah. Though, I still recognize that it is better than anywhere else I'd work at this point. 

7. I just feel like boasting all the time about Chris and I. While I suppose that is bad, essentially it is not. We have been dating for seven months as of yesterday and I am still as happy as I have ever been with him. It is strange when people ask me about how we're doing and when I tell them that we have yet to have a real fight or any problems, they're almost searching for something that must be wrong. ""Okay, no fights, but what does he do that makes you angry?"" ""Well, to be perfectly honest, there really isn't anything."" ""I know, I know, but what frustrates you?"" etc., etc. I still maintain the position that I'm the luckiest girl in the world and I'm very happy about it =].

8. Hope and love and good vibes are still what I'm choosing to surround myself with. Unfortunately, other people can't accept that, though they still prevail. Sorry, life, everyone else's negativity and blame can't be placed on me this year."

Summer's over.

My highlights for this summer would have to be the mini road trip with Dayne and Andrew and just in general spending so much amazing and lovely time with Chris.

This summer was most definately <b>not</b> like any summer I've had before, but I suppose I'm glad. No regrets, except for not finishing the Harry Potter series this summer. 


Senior year I would guess will be filled with theater like no one has seen before, except for the few of us that were around when we were freshman. College prep classes for the first time since freshman year and working on weekends and blahblahblah, but lots of good times in between. Andrew and I will not be the only drivers this year! Yesss! Yes, yes, yes!

<b>How were your summers</b>?"

Sometimes I lose faith in people and it turns me into this kind of recluse, only establishing roots with myself and very few other things, whether they're tangible or abstract. 

Then there's other days like today when your day starts off just right and that flows into lunch with someone as wonderful as Toni and getting the best birthday present ever (""Don't Hassel The Hoff"" t-shirt) and turning into adventures with Michelle and Andrew's house and code 453-ing it with Judy and Michelle and Scrabble at McClure's and Scattegories and really, really good times. 

I guess I was right to have hope. 
I just wish I could lend it to all those lacking it around me."

I've started about six entries since my last one and never posted them, mostly because they are just boring, as I suspect this one will be.


Nothing eventful has happened since my parents left. For some reason I feel as if I'm old or boring now because I didn't try to do anything WiLD N CRZY L0L while they were gone. Instead days have been wasted with waking up, glancing over at the person I got to wake up to, smiling, going back to bed, repeating five or six times, or it has been wasted walking around places by myself and enjoying my own company, or it has been wasted discovering new joys that I can experience each day. Though, in the end I don't believe that is wasting it at all.

School is here in only two weeks. How did the time pass so quickly? I am excited about a schedule while equally dreading it. I'm excited for seeing people that I've missed everyday and I'm excited about doing what <b>I</b> want to do and I'm excited about making a good impression on my teachers this year and actually keeping it. I'm excited about making plans for my future, even if it's a slightly scary thought.

Anyways, I'm either going to a bon fire tonight or going to see MC Flow. We'll see how the night progresses."

I've become very cheap now that I have a semi-significant amount of money. I did give Noosh a twelve dollar tip last night, though. She is well worth it, I think.

Life takes so many turns; sometimes my stomach gets a little confused which way it's supposed to turn and which body parts it's supposed to follow. 


My parents are both going out of town as of tomorrow: let's have some good times, okay? HIT ME UP.

Our first day arriving in the apartment.
This included seeing Andrew's Dad's strange arrangement of food items and getting used to each other, haha.

Working all weekend. 
Birthday on Monday.
I can't help but feel like it'll be a letdown.
I'm trying to get myself mentally prepared, mostly by announcing to my mom or whoever is around that I'm just going to hang around the house, get some stuff done, read, etc. 
That, of course, is not what I really want. 
What can you do.
Life has been treating me really well, I shouldn't be greedy and expect a good birthday on top of everything else it's given me. 



I've been looking into UC Santa Cruz a lot, lately. They have a graduate program that most other schools I've looked into don't have that I'm considering, not to mention it's semi-affordable compared to the places I <b>really</b> want to go to. I've basically ruled out going to Reed completely. It will always be my dream school, but money will always be there to tell me I just can't have it.



Everyone should go see The Format on Tuesday. It's at SOMA, sadly, but I think it'll be fun.

<b>P.S.</b>
Seeing as I'm very sick of this whole snap-and-shoot with my camera lately, I feel the need to get back to really taking advantage of everything my babayyyy can do. So, does anyone want to have a bit of a photoshoot with me? It would involve getting down in the dirt a tad near the end and possibly feeling a little silly in front of a camera for a bit of time, but I think it'd turn out really nice. If you want to, let me know!"

This was the real turn around point to my summer. A lovely adventure with Michelle, Brittany, Judy and I. 

THIS IS HOW MATURE WE ARE. 
Note: the s in shoe was actually out, we didn't just take it out.

-i work too much.
-i have a really cool employee named kari! she is really rad and she uses livejournal! whoo! what a good combinaton!
-one happening with ""good"" friends this week made me realize i have a lot more fake friends than i thought.
-one happening with good friends this week made me realize sometimes you just need people to be there. even if it's just to eat and laugh.
-talked to my mom about the panic attack. she said i need to stop taking in everyone's problems, and just let them deal with it by themselves and talk about my problems every now and then. i jokingly said ""haha, mom, that's why i have livejournal."" she got annoyed and said it's not funny. yet the last three times i've seen her she has just went on and on about her problems in her life, no matter how big or small? uhmmm...bullshit?
-chris and i will have been dating for six months on monday. are people supposed to celebrate these things?
-birthday is not this monday, but the week after. come on guys, give me ideas.

No one uses LiveJournal anymore. It kind of makes me sad.
What makes it even more depressing is that most people only come to LiveJournal for sad or angry rants. Which I am <b>not</b> saying is bad. Anyone who reads my LiveJournal has seen my fair share of them, to say the least. However, where did the happy rants go? Am I imagining posts full of the phrase ""best summer ever"" or actually seeing the word ""happy"" without not or I wish I was in front of it, or did they really exist, just not anymore?

One question is constantly haunting my mind: why is it that people get angry when their friends are happy? Okay, I worded that as to not sound selfish. <i>Let me revise.</i> Why is it that my ""friends forever"" are all angry at me? Because I can't help but feel it's because I have never been happier. I understand that you all see me dramatically less now. Sometimes it's for reasons as simple and selfish as I'm spending time with Chris, but a lot of times it goes a lot further than that. I didn't intend for this to turn into the rants I was just speaking of, but maybe it needs to be, because I must admit I am a little angry at you all, too. Have any of you guys called me just to talk? Okay, I don't hang out as much, but I can't remember the last time I heard a message saying ""hey, just called to talk and catch up,"" with the exception of two or three very kind messages I've received from Toni. Just because I may have disappeared does not mean it's because I'm ditching you all. If anyone actually was interested in learning a thing or two about my life at the moment they'd see that. But let's face it guys: the majority of you (my friends) call me to go have a good time, because without trying to sound conceited, or shit, forget trying to not sound conceited, let's make it very conceited instead: I'm quite good at turning a dull evening into a ridiculously entertaining and enjoyable adventure. That's why you guys are friends with me - not for my kindness, not for my heart, but for my entertainment value.

Let's change subjects. 
This is the best summer ever. 
I am really happy. 
There's so much more STUFF than you all know, but I am trying my best (and succeeding) in remaining internally happy. 
Chris and I are really, really good. 
That's another tidbit I find interesting: I am <b>not</b> exaggerating when I say that probably about forty people so far have asked me ""So, have you and Chris had sex yet?"" either randomly out of nowhere or they tried to beat around the bush until they just ask straight out. Yet I can count on one hand how many of you have genuinely asked me how we're doing. Haha. You assholes.
My birthday is on the 30th. I'm thinking of a quiet evening. Bleh, to be honest it's because I think I've upset so many people these last couple of months that I'm not expecting much =/. Yeah, I'm angry about it somewhat, as you could see from the above, but I do feel bad. Everytime I go to my little LiveJournal and read all your entries, they break my heart because I know I'm not doing anything to make it better. Everytime I think about it and realize my friend count has been dwindling I sigh, but try to shrug it off. Though, I think what makes me the saddest is this feeling that I can't shrug off or shake off or wish away. It's as if my head doesn't even search for understanding in any of my friends, because I honestly don't feel like they want to. 

At the end of the day I must quote what my MySpace said a bit ago. ""I'm painfully true to myself."" Let me tell you, I have never been more true to myself than I have been recently, nor have I ever felt the effect more painfully. I feel more passionate about life and living and more inspired than I ever have been. I'm trying to be happy for myself, if for nothing else, for that.





Sorry that turned into an angry-ish rant. I'm not angry, though.
I am extremely happy.

<b>::EDIT::</b>
One year and two days ago was when I found out my parents were separating. That thought has been one of the few things I could think about and that with a combination of....a lot...has been why I couldn't handle friends this last week or two. Sorry, I guess. The rest you'd have to ask me personally about. Not LiveJournal appropriate."

Friday: 9:45-5:15
Saturday: 9:45-5:15
Sunday: 10:45-5:15


Anyone want to make plans after any of those days?
On the bright side I discovered an excellent way to turn my car into a bed.
Road trip was good. I would post pictures, but the cord is still mysteriously missing.

This moment is very close to perfection, I wish I could capture it in a photograph, but I know it won't do it justice, so I'm not even going to try. The thing I love more than anything else about this house is the way the downstairs looks in the morning. Between eight and nine in the morning, the yellow fabric shades make the most warm and cozy glow over the entire room. The backyard gives just enough sunshine to warm up bare skin and the kitchen is shady, yet bright enough to feel alive. Right now the house is clean and tidy and there is nothing that needs to be done except to enjoy the moment. In front of me is chocolate milk in a young, plastic cup and sugar cinnamon toast to match. Ninja is playing on the carpet and Duke is sleeping under my feet. Tennis is playing on the television and commentary over the last grueling five hour match is muffled by Bob Dylan's welcoming voice. I have the house to myself, yet I don't feel the tiniest bit alone.


Other notable things:
-Life is fantastic =]!
-Wonderful things are in store for the next few days.
-I get to see Chris on Tuesdaygnegwnlknwlhyayyayyayay!

Oh and I got my ACT scores. My writing was in the 99%, and that made me very happy. However, despite all my scores being rather high, due to a <b>ridiculously</b> low score on my science section I ended up with a 28. Oh well =]."

I've been social lately. Summer has begun.

People have been surprising me, both for good reasons and bad. 

1. Spending time with Michelle, Megan, Andrew, Brittany, Dayne, Judy, Rickey, etc., etc., etc. has been so comforting. It's an indescribably good feeling to spend time with a group of people you <b>know</b> and people who <b>know</b> you. I respect them all so much, mostly for the fact that they are just themselves. I can't stress enough how much I admire that in people and it's such a great vibe to be surrounded by. 

2. Then of course there's the bad. It's interesting how when you discover one lie in someone, that endless more began to be revealed. At this point, I don't know how someone would be able to live with themselves, knowing that you own a different indentity with each person you know.


<b>No comments for today</b>. 
There is a huge picture post coming as soon as I can just get myself to do it. 
Tomorrow before work maybe?"

That was by far exactly what my summer needed.
Despite being too tired to function and and using half of a gas tank and and looking like shit and needing to be at work in an hour for perhaps the longest eight hour shift of my life, that was exactly what I needed.

I feel oddly rejuvenated and alive and carefree.

Lesson learned:
Never underestimate simple things like a block of ice, friends you can always count on, hot chocolate and the love/hate relationship with sleeping in your car."

I feel poopy. 
Excuse my five-year-old vocabulary, but it's what popped into my mind.
At least work went by quickly today.



I'm trying to get back into the social world.
Here's my schedule:


Tomorrow: take Chris to station. work 2-6. run and sleep.
Wednesday: I am free, lucky you.
Thursday: I am free, lucky you.
Friday: work 9:30-5. movie with Daddy.
Saturday: work 10-5.

If anyone wants to throw themselves in there, just let me know."

I find myself at a personal crossroad. These last four or five months I've stopped defining myself through my academic success, or lack of, and I've begun to look at myself as more than how others see me.

While I am proud of the progress I've made in this area, it's left me lost.

Being so young and so inexperienced, I realize that my opportunities are listless, especially considering my excellent grades up until this semester - a semester's grades that can be brushed under the carpet with a persuasive acceptance essay.  There's limitless paths set in front of me, yet what I'm searching for can't be found in any of them. I've actually discussed this with Chris before. Even though I know that I can do quite well in typical American society, it's simply not what I want. The last thing I could ever want at this point is a mediocre, yet high paying, job and living for my next raise. How boring is that? I want adventures that aren't excuses for being young, but reasons for being alive. I want to backpack from country to country or spend months without showering because I'm living in a hut in some societally abandoned tribe helping families grow enough food for the next winter. I want to go back to Barquisimeto [Venezuela] and look into the eyes of the little girl that asked me to come back for her. I want to use my own money to help someone who would use it a lot better. I know all of this sounds extreme, but who cares. Maybe an extreme life is what I want. It would be a lot more fulfilling than my current status: going from class to class and person to person and day to day only because I have to. Please don't take the previous statement pessimistically. There are a few people I currently have in my life that give me those feelings, particularly a certain boyfriend [you know - one out of the 6946043 of them that I have ]  who lets me experience those feelings of really living everytime I see them. And every day I walk into the theater I breathe a little more life into me, whether it's myself on stage or seeing art engulf someone new.

Still, I don't want to waste my youth. I mean my youthyouth, now, today, yesterday, tomorrow, this summer, next year. In many of my teachers eyes I'm disappointing them because I'm missing homework assignments or not coming to school enough. But I'm disapponting myself because I waste so much of my life in areas that I have no passion in. Why live a passionless life? Everyone has said at least once that ""you only have one life to live,"" yet I look around and see everyone in their seats, pretending to listen so they can get the grades to get them to UCLA so they can get a degree in money-making-careers so they can afford a new car to match their new house to match their new bills.

I hope to spend this summer exploring my passions. I've already found a couple of them in my sixteen years, but I can't imagine how many are still undiscovered. And you'll see me with a smile on my face when encountering each one.



Bleh.
Maybe I'm just talking to myself here?"

I'm trying to think of what's ""new.""
It's getting more and more difficult to do.

AP English Language went a lot better than English Literature.
I have to get rid of Ninja; the extent of allergies she's causing me is unbearable now.



There's simply very few things that I actually have a desire to do anymore. I want to have more talks with Toni and Dayne during school hours or outside of them or on adventures. I want to spend days wasting time with Chris and feeling like life will be okay as long as he's there with me. I want to gossip with my Mom and talk with Layah and feel a security that you get from having a family, that I just don't have anymore. 
(Two out of three isn't bad?) 

Well, that's what's ""new.""
Choosing my classes next Monday.
My senior year looks like it'll be my first ""slacker"" year, as far as classes, in the history of my high school career!



I am okay.
I am okay in the best way that one can be okay.
I am okay."

The set-up: 
Me or Chris would have someone stand in front of the camera and one of us would ask ""Smile if you want to have sex with me."" We recorded their reactions.

Some of us looked better than others.
That's all I'm going to say about that...

Fast forward to Saturday night!
The last night of the show/the last show of the year/the last show of the seniors high school careers.

Miguel had these amazing skills and figured out how to play ""Falling In Love Is Wonderful"" in just about three seconds.

Though, I must say, today brought it back up.
Chris came over before school because we started late for testing.
Surprise, surprise, neither him, me or Kourtnie had a strong, fiery passion to go to school.
The next obvious answer?
Go to Tijuana, of course!
We did.
It was an adventure to say the least.
Note: Never take Kourtnie to TJ.
It's almost as bad as taking her to Peter Piper's Pizza, and that's pretty damn bad.
Life has been treating me well, though.
My both extremely possitive/extremely negative view on life has been oddly perfect.



I want to get back in touch with some people, though.
One thing I am is completely aware of myself, and I know I've been neglecting a lot of my friend duties, mostly surrounding giving my actual time to them.
So, let's hang out.
Let's have adventures like we used to =]."

Annie Get Your Gun is opening on Thursday. 
We had to cancel invitation dress.
Both McLeClair <b>and</b> the choreographer think we need to cancel this week of shows and wait til next week to open. Ms. B is the only one who remains to have hope in us. 
Terrifying?
Yes.
I didn't know I'd have such an odd connection to the show after assistant directing.



I suppose I'm just drained.
I've gained a few superficial friendships lately.
The weird part is, they don't know that they're gained them.
One would assume they think it's the same as always.
Actually, a large majority of you are experiencing a superficial friendship with me lately.
This is meant to no offense to anyone and if you honestly want to know, then I would tell you if you are or are not one of the people who are getting the ""real"" version, lately. 
It is not superficial in a bad way.
It is superficial in a ""life would be really nice to not have to deal with this one aspect of it, so by being a superficial friend to the majority of people right now, I <b>won't</b> have a nervous breakdown"" way.


School has taken much more than a backseat lately.
I'm getting more than one C this semester.
[I'm a straight A student.] 
The biggest bright side at the moment is Chris.
Heavens knows I hate to be cheesy, but our relationship really is just that; it's cheesy.
If I would have saw myself a month before we started dating, I wouldn't have guessed it was me.
I probably would have been angry for doing what I always hate: I've given him a huge priority in my life. Yet, I have no regrets. 



Overall, I am tired.
I am hopeful as I typically am.
[Haha - Adam just borrowed the computer for about ten minutes and I fell asleep. I told you I was tired.]"

Spring break is very, very close to ending. 
Three out of my four high school Spring breaks are over.
Every one has gotten better and better.
Still, I'm anxious for summer.


It wouldn't be an understatement to say these last couple of months have been the best of my life, and this Sping break had a lot to do with it.
Hanging out with Chris, Toni, Michelle, Fernando, Kourtnie, Andrew, etc., etc., etc. have made this entirely new set of memories that I'll attach to my ""youth"" that I'll look back upon.
Still, I'm anxious for summer.

<center>Sometimes it's just nice to remember that
                                  I don't know anything yet.</center>

It's nice to enjoy youth for what it is and not worry.
It's nice to enjoy the company of ten different people in your living room - most of them obnoxious and loud, yet all meshing together nicely. 
It's nice to look at your Frederich Douglas book lying on the toaster oven and not taking a second glace other than to pass a short chuckle at your Spring break assignments. 
It's nice to relax the entire day and watch three or four or however many different movies and youtube videos and eat unhealthy food and just enjoy being alive.



Yeah.
Spring break is nice; it is really, really nice."

Monte Vista vs. El Cajon Valley at laser tag.
Monte Vista kicked some serious butt.
Partially thanks to some amazing costume-ing and my surprisingly amazing laser tag skills despite my lack of experience.

The only way to put me in a better mood before we met up with everyone else?
Why dancing and singing loudly to ridiculously good music with some best friends, of course.

Spring break has been flooded with such immense amounts of fun and adventure already.
I can't comprehend that it's only Monday night.
My friends are amazing.
My friends that you kind of forget are there are amazing.
My old friends are amazing.
My wonderful boyfriend is amazing.
My best friends are amazing.
I've been loving seeing Michelle and Toni so much.
I've been loving sleeping into the double digits.
I've been loving driving all day with the windows down.
I've been loving having no worries.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow and free museums and a picnic in Balboa with Michelle and Toni.
I'm looking forward to two more weeks of this amazing feeling.
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone.
I'm looking forward to getting over this undeniable guilt.
I'm looking forward to never making <i>real</i> plans.
I'm looking forward to life."

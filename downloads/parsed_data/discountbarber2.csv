For you, kissing is about all about following your urges
							  If someone's hot, you'll go in for the kiss - end of story
							  You can keep any relationship hot with your steamy kisses
							  A total spark plug - your kisses are bound to get you in trouble</td></tr><tr><td align=""center"" bgcolor=""#FFA5B2""><h3 style=""margin: 0; border: 0;"">Part Shy Kisser</h3></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=""#FFDBE0""><div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.quizdiva.net/kindkisser/shy.jpg""></div>
You *do* love to kiss, once your comfortable with it
							  And that means knowing the person you're kissing pretty well
							  You usually don't make the first move when it comes to making out
							  But you've got plenty of intensity in return</td></tr></table>

"event","so recently i've realized that i think a lot of people perceive me as a dick. my english teacher in high school used to say ""people act as they are perceived"" ... so logically if i think people perceive me as a dick, i must act like a dick (wow that's really weird...the way that my window is sized, the phrase ""people perceive me as a dick"" was typed in the same place on two different lines). anyways, i don't really like that. i mean, who would like being a dick? but still. it sucks. i think i used to be seen as a good guy. i really don't care what other people think about me usually... but i really do care about what my friends think of me. I don't want my friends to see me as a dick. and, at heart, i don't think i am. but i think lately i have done some things to earn that title i guess. like every once in a while i'll say something and be like damn... that came out really wrong. so... to any of my friends that are reading this, i'm sorry if i've come off as anything i've described above. the only two friends i have on here are becca, kym and ann-marie though... all of whom i think deserve that apology. ann-marie because we haven't really hung out much, and that makes me sad. and kym... while the trip down to sc this time was fun, i kept getting the feeling something was wrong. and i hope it wasn't me. (did i leave my cell phone charger down there?). And becca, ever since we moved in together it seems like we have seen less of each other than normal. all three of you are really important to me as friends, so if i have indeed been an ass to you lately, i am very sorry. 

on another note, i'm seeing +/- on thursday. i just put on their cd... and i forgot how much i love this band. there are not too many things in the world better than seeing a band that you're really in to at the time. i mean, i see a lot of bands that i've loved at one time or another. for instance, i saw streetlight manifesto on thursday, and it was really fun. i loved the show. but at that time, i just really wansn't into the whole ska thing at the time. i was on a big indie kick at the time, so while streetlight was fun, it wasn't as fun as it could have been. but i'm just starting on to another +/- kick again, and the show is thursday, so i think it should be a lot of fun. anyone wanna go with me? :)

as for updates on what's been going on with me, since i don't update very often...
i just got a new house the other day in fairfax, about 2 miles from my school (George Mason University, i transfered from virginia tech this semester). I work for this booking/promotions/management company now called Next Level Promotions. it's been awesome... things have been going really well, and we've been getting a lot of contacts and shows going and stuff. if only i was making money doing it... but it's not that big of a deal. it's a lot of fun and i love doing it. unfortunately, i don't have a job as of now that pays me, but my parents are helping me out with rent. i hope i don't stretch myself too thin with 18 credit hours at mason, working for next level, and eventually a real job that i can make money off of. 

I am also filling in on bass for One Third Dork (www.myspace.com/onethirddork) for the next month or so. cal (the bassist) went to thailand for a while, so i'll be playing shows with OTD till he gets back. we have a 21+ show on saturday in dc at the velvet lounge, and an 18+ show in fairfax on the 11th of march. that's a lot of fun, i love playing bass, and i haven't been doing it near enough lately. i need to get better. i jammed with joedan from 33 west (god what a great band) the other day. it was a lot of fun, but it made me realize how much i need to practice. 

also, i met my mom's brother the other day for the 2nd time in my life (yes, my uncle, i was just specifying that it's on my mom's side)... and he brought his son, who was a really cool guy. he came back to my house with me after we all had dinner, and it was a lot of fun. kind of weird hanging out with your cousin for the first time when you're 19 years old. that was interesting. i showed him 33 west and he loves them now. that makes me happy. i've been meeting more people at GMU... it's been good. i like gmu so much more than tech. anyways, i have class in about an hour, and i have to go meet becca and one of our new friends for lunch before class. so i'll end my entry here. i'll try to get on again and update some more, but taking a look at the frequency that i've updated in the past, you can probably assume that won't happen. but who knows?"

"event","So... it's been a while since i've touched this thing. But i'm finally home for good. I'm done with tech. And i've actually had time to relax. It's been amazing. So... some of the things i had wanted to do (call them goals if you will) when i came home were: 1. start a band 2. coach/manage a little league baseball team 3. get a job at a recording studio 4. go to school and study math so i can become a teacher 5. make some money. 6. get an apartment and move in with becca. I wasn't trying to do it all at once... but at some point, I would have liked to do each of those. Well... opportunities for the first 3 have come up within the last 24 hours, and... I just don't know what i'm going to do. I don't have that much fucking time.

I went with my friend Cal to chipotle yesterday. He's one of the guys who I want to start up a band with. I'll talk about that more later if i feel like it... but he was saying that he was very excited for the idea that i had for the band and wanted to start as soon as possible. So afterwards we jammed for a bit and it sounded really good. I'm excited. so yay... got the ball rolling on one of those things. Then he had to meet his other band in the studio to record something and invited me along. I figured I'd go... why not. The guy that did the recording for them was the nicest guy i have met in a long time. I was amazed at the outlook this guy had on everything... and i really enjoyed everything that was going on in the studio. I talked to Mike (the recording guy) and he said that they're always looking for interns there... and there are usually slots open because it's an unpaid internship... which i don't really mind. It'd be kind of like going to school for free... for something that i really enjoy doing. So that got the ball rolling on a second thing last night... though i was kind of hoping that if i got a job at a recording studio, i could also make some money... since i would have to start doing that anyways... but oh well that's still a nice option. I'm going to go back to the studio with them a couple more times and make sure i really want to do it before i dive in.. but i really think i want to do it. 

Then this morning i got an email from someone at Falls Churck Kiwanis Little League (FCKLL)... that's the little league i played in as a kid... and i emailed someone about the possibility of coaching/managing a team in the spring... not really expecting to get a team or anything, but just so i got my name out there and stuff... and then he emailed me back this morning saying he'd love to talk to me about managing a team and that i should call him. so that made me excited as well. 

Then this morninig i kind of stopped to think... wait... so by the end of the month, at this rate, i'll be in a band... have a job at a recording studio... be going to school full time... have a little league team to manage... AND i'd have to get another job so that i could start paying rent on a place? hmm i don't think there are enough hours in the day for that. I think what i'm gonna do is email the FCKLL guy... tell him that I'm still trying to settle down in this area and that i just don't know how much time i would have to devote to a team... cuz i don't want to take on that responsibility without knowing how much free time i'd have... that wouldn't be cool... and i'll just try to get a team in the fall or next spring... then ... I don't know, i might just live at home for a semester (sorry becca) and work on just going to school, working at the recording studio and being in a band... and maybe if i have free time start working so that i can start saving up again so that i can get an apartment with her next semester... or over the summer... that's enough to keep my busy but not going out of my mind. 

So i have a lot going on... but it's all stuff that i really want to do. So i'm very excited. I just have to stop and think... make sure i have the time and sanity to devote to all of these things. But 2005 is starting off very well. i hate to jinx it by saying that... but thus far... yea i'm busy but in a good way. 

Well now i'm off to hang out with matt... it's his last night here. I'm taking him to the airport at 7 am tomorrow... and i probably won't see him again for another year or so. sucks. oh well. 

i need to clean my room and unpack from college still. i'm so lazy. oh well. time to go hang out with matt."

"event","Have you ever been in a moment where you were just like ""this moment is really important... i'll bet it will forever be a fond (or not fond... depending on the situation) memory forever? And anything that has to do with that night or time in your life will always remind you of that moment? well I do that sometimes... and especially with shanna lately, i've been trying to create these moments... which just doesn't work. You can't just be like ""tonight will be special"" or ""whatever happens, i'll always remember tonight""... i mean it makes sense to think about it, logically it should work... but life's completely illogical sometimes. I find that the memories that i have and look back on really fondly are just spontaneous moments or seemingly (at the time) random moments. so obviously this theory is false. god dammit why does my mind have to be so logical? 

anyways... what made me think of this is... a lot of times i relate special moments in my life to the song that was playing at that time. like... when i went skiing with my family once, i listened to the smashing pumpkins a lot... and still to this day when i hear disc 1 of their melon collie cd, i think of that trip. Well, the same goes for this past summer with shanna. One weekend, after we hadn't been dating for very long at all, she was going to go to philadelphia to look for apartments (when she was going to move there), and i offered to drive her. On this trip, we stopped by her friend's house for the night in new jersey (which was a lot closer to nyc than philly... but somehow it worked) and on that trip i showed her a couple of bands that she really liked... I voted for kodos and The Long Winters... and on that trip, i think, is when i looked at her... and just knew we'd be together for a long time and that this was real... (could have said when i fell in love with her, but that'd be a little cliche..) and... every time i hear either band, i start reminiscing (and start losing the ability to spell or care aparently) about just everything between the two of us. The amazing summer... that first month... and it gets me all sappy and ""emo""... haha i hate it when i get like this. so does she, though. i wrote her an email last time i listened to IV4K... she just kind of laughed at me (hell, i woulda too) the title of my email to her was ""Blame IV4K, they made me do it""... so i decided to kind of write my thoughts down in here since i don't really post on here anymore and felt like writing it down. well... it's 3:30 and i'm doing my math hw... physics soon to follow :-/ back to work. hooray for school."

"event","So it's been a really long time since I've updated this thing. My life has been really busy... but really good lately. I just hope it's not setting me up for another downfall... i hope the good (amazing) of this summer is finally repaying me for the shit i went through last year. Sure, i had my share of shit this summer... kind of lost touch with a couple really close friends... one that i met, became really close with, and haven't talked to recently all in one summer. i hope that all changes. but i had a good job, saved up a lot of money, and i found someone i genuinely care about and that cares about me... it's wonderful. i never thought i'd be so lucky as to find someone like that... but i was. and still am. i just hope everything works out, but i'm fairly confident it will. 

i just moved back in at school last night, and... i really don't know how to feel about being here again. walking around campus this morning, all i could think about and see were places that remind me of the shit from last year... this is where i had a mental breakdown... this is where i completely lost it, this is the walk i used to take in the worst moods of my life after that fucking class... but it's all behind me now. having that year under my belt and being as comfortable with my place in life right now as i am, makes me actually optimistic about this year... but it's hard to forget the shit i went through last year. i just hope i can keep that all behind me. 

and then there's the whole thing about being away from shanna. we only met a month ago, but it seems like we've been together for months, mostly because we spent almost every day of the last third of the summer together... i guess this distance thing is the first true test. but i have no doubts... 

i did a phone survey for some stupid college research thing yesterday. one of the questions was ""how is your outlook on the future, on a scale of 1-4?"" i looked at the girl i had under my right arm, thought about it for a second, and for the first time in my life, i was able to honestly tell him 4."

"event","Ah school is almost over. i just got back from my last physics class of the semester. i was actually kind of sad to leave that class because my teacher is so awesome. as an example of his awesomness... on the last test, he wasn't going to give partial credit because he had to get the exams back quickly (he still hasn't gotten our second exam back to us... which we took a month and a half ago) ... but yea on test 3 i shoulda got a 30 on the exam without partial credit... but he gave it anyways and i got a 73. he's also just one of the nicest guys i've ever met, genuinely cares about his students. 

i'm about to go to my last english class ever (provided i pass of course... but i should). i have to turn in my research paper and give a presentation on it... i so would not have been able to finish it if it weren't for Rebecca Eileen. you are amazing. and then i have a C++ project to start and get done by 8 pm tomorrow. there's no way in hell i'm going to be able to finish it... but i have to at least somewhat get it working so i get some credit. Provided my program works at all though, i should pass that class, which is amazing considering the first half of the semester. 

oh ! and i got into a music theory class for next semester! i'm now up to 19 credit hours, and that class is MWF at 9:05 am... i wouldn't subject myself to that for any other class... but i'm really looking forward to that one. maybe i'll drop sociology so that i'm not too overwhelmed next year. but i don't have to live with my douchebag roommate next year either so that'll be awesome. haha he got caught with pot and he's getting kicked out for 2 semesters. sucks for him. oh well. 

anyways i have to go prepare this presentation for english and take a shower and such. i can't wait till summer! after 8 pm tomorrow, i'll pretty much be home free. then i'm working at AOL this summer for 15 bucks an hour... so i should actually have money for once. yea. ok bye

oh... and happy early birthday Becka! i know it's tomorrow... but yea. i hope packing's going well, and if i don't talk to you, i hope your move goes smoothly, and hopefully i'll see ya soon"

"event","Wow so it's been a long time since i've updated this. But i have a rough draft for a 6-8 page research paper due tomorrow, and i haven't even started researching, let alone writing... so what better time to update??

I wish i didn't have a short attention span. i'd be so much better at school... but oh well. So i just got word that Becka is moving to Maryland in a few weeks, Becca (notice the spelling difference...) is moving to charleston in a few weeks... crazy stuff. i'm happy that Becca and Kym are friends again though! and that i got to see Kym for the first time since new years... so that makes me happy. 

School wise... well i wish i was doing as well. I have 2 weeks of classes left, and sooo much shit left to do. 3 exams,  3 projects, a research paper and this group ""homework assignment"" which is going to take forever and is basically a project to do within that time period. but once those 2 weeks are up, i'll only have finals to worry about (funny how i'm actually looking forwad to finals) and then three weeks from right now i will be home for summer!!!! and seeing between the buried and me 3 weeks from tonight... that's the only thing that's keeping me going. summer...sigh. 

well i guess i should go and do some research and write some of this paper. i hope i get some sleep tonight... physics exam day after tomorrow too... it never fucking ends.

well i have a long night ahead of me... oh did i mention i have a class at 8 am tomorrow too? i am so sleeping between classes tomorrow. and this weekend isn't gonna be any break cuz i have a c++ exam to study for on wednesday.... ahhhhhh someone push fast forward and get me to 2 weeks from today. please!!!

I'm just really glad i got to see becca and kym this weekend, otherwise i'd be completely insane. i hope kym made it down to charleston ok... 

ok maybe i should go research and write and all that good stuff... hope everyone is doing better than i."

"event","so yay i'm back at tech now. yesterday was an interesting day though... originally, i planned on going to see urban style and rude buddha in woodbridge, then driving down after the show. then i told becca about it and she wanted to go, so she offered me a tank of gas and food if i went and got her and brought her to the show... which wouldn't have been that bad, but then it started sleeting... then snowing on top of it. so i told becca i couldn't go down to see her and i figured i'd just wait till late so that i could drive after the roads had been treated a little... but then i found out that the system was pretty much all north of fredericksburg, so i drove through it just in northern va and then went and saw becca and then went back to tech. i got here by like 2 or something... the drive wasn't bad at all... and i talked to my friend jacoba on the way back which was fun cuz she lives in california. then i talked to becka till like 4 or 4:30 or something. i'm so happy though... my roommate isn't here. i dislike him greatly. i hope he doesn't come back for some reason... though according to murphy's law, he will. i'm going to radford today to see big fish again (for the third time). i love that movie. i think it's safe to say that's probably my second favorite movie (next to the princess bride, of course).

i woke up this morning and my arm was asleep. it was really really weird cuz i touched my arm and i didn't even feel it so i was like what the hell is this under my pillow... and i realized it was my arm, just that i had no feeling in it. when i moved it and the blood started rushing through it... that was one of the weirdest feelings ever. i could actually like feel the blood filling my veins again. kinda scary... note to self... don't sleep on that arm weird again. well my first class isn't till 1:30 tomorrow afternoon... so back to the college life. and i was taking 18 credit hours... but one of my classes got cancelled randomly, so i'm down to 15... which i'm really not complaining about... maybe that'll save me from suicide... though maybe it won't. well back to sleep for a while... then a good old west end breakfast (eatery thingy in my dorm... yea)"

"event","so... yea i need a haircut. yesterday was fun. i went to see big fish with becca and my family. my parents both cried and loved the movie. that made me happy. i think that Big Fish is now one of my favorite movies of all time... not quite as good as the Princess Bride (which is my favorite) but relatively close. i think the reason i like it so much (big fish) is cuz it reminds me a lot of my grandfather who died like 6 years ago... but he was one of those guys who was really funny that everyone loved and always made an impact on everyone... and just knowing someone like that and even losing them... just made big fish that much better for me in general i think. then becca and i went to a japanese steakhouse with my mom, which was fun. it was hella cold in there but i didn't mind too much. all of the people working there were wearing coats and stuff. people are funny. so i worked a whole lot this week...a nd i'm gettin paid 11 bucks an hour so i'm very happy. then after the movies and dinner, becca and i hung out and talked for a long time. that was good... i enjoy having good conversations with people. :) ... then i talked to becka for a few hours (as usual) and i was really exhausted... i was pretty much sleep talking for part of it and there are some things i said that i definitely don't recall... oh well. it's all in good fun i guess... anywyas so i'm going to see rude buddha tonight. i saw them down at tech and they were actually nice to me... they kinda get assholish and full of themselves at times... but overall they're a pretty good band. i hope the other bands are good though. anyways ... yea i'm gonna head off to the show..."

"event","so i've just gotten the urge to play a very old game that i used to love as a kid... lode runner. does anyone even know what that game is? or where i could get the original version? i have one that is pretty good... but the controls are weird... and i'm looking for a more user friendly one. i doubt anyone will even know what this game is though (besides kym and melissa cuz i showed it to them)"

"event","so yea... i'm listening to cursive. they're really good.... thanks becka :) this is the first time in a while that someone told me to listen to a band and i liked them right away. i usually discover bands on my own or someone tells me about them and i finally start liking the music like months later. but yea... cursive is good. :)

matt and i hung out today. we are writing a song... it's pretty cool, but really weird. i wish i was a better bassist... this song is so complicated... so many weird time signatures and time changes and stuff... but it's a lot of fun :) then matt and i went on a random drive around like the springfield area... it was fun. i took one turn a little too hard though (really windy road) and almost crashed.... but that's ok. we listened to the donnie darko score the whole time... god that cd is so good... really dark, pretty... i love that. i wish i was creative enough to write stuff like that... 

anyways i'm bored... i think i'm gonna go play some lode runner. what a great game. goodnight"

"event","so yea... it's now 4:30 am and i just got off the phone... and i was tired, but of course now i'm not. my sister has a basketball game at 11:30 that i think i'm going to go to... grr i want a full night of sleep... sometime. i haven't had one all year! (<corny but true ""joke"") so yea.... charleston was awesome again. i always have so much fun when i go down there... and i love hanging out with kym and melissa... board games all the way... and their friends are awesome. haha that trick that tay played on melanie was classic. and becka is just one of the awesomest people i've met in a long time. i love meeting new people. well that's not true... i love meeting cool new people. i hope you have a good trip and a good time in england, kym. and melissa... say hi to trivet for me. aww the marks on my hand/arm remind me of him (*sniff??*) i'll try to update this more often now i guess... tay acted as the surgeon general and warned me of the addictive nature of the drug that is LJ... but what can i say? i'm of the rebellious sort i guess..."

"event","yay it's 2004... i guess yay anyways. today's my last day in charleston. i hope we actually do something. last night was so fun. i'm glad kym is my friend and i'm glad she has super cool friends. last night was semi fun... but then almost as soon as 2004 started, kym's friends showed up and it was so much better. we went to the beach and it was really pretty out. i love stars... i'm such a nerd. yea i'm gonna go sit around and do nothing till i can convince kym and melissa to do something. i hope it's as fun as my last night here last time... where we went around the streets of charleston asking everybody ""what's cooler than being cool"" by the way... i hope most of you know. so answer me. what is cooler than being cool (and it's definitely NOT you)"

"event","yea so i just got back from ODU for the weekend. it was fun. i saw thrice, thursday and coheed & cambria. amazing show. i was withing like 10 people of the front for all three bands, so needless to say i'm pretty damn sore. it was hella fun though. the whole weekend, i stayed with my friend alex at ODU. the first night i got there, we played super mario world on his computer the whole night... then watched a movie and went to breakfast at 7 am since we were still up. it was cool. then the next day we beat the whole game, getting all the yoshi coins and everything. it was kinda sad but so fun all at the same time. his roommates and suitemates are all awesome and hella nice. it was a good weekend. plus the show was absolutely amazing. anyways... so i have a huge homework assignment due tomorrow and we have a group project due on wednesday that we have to work on... you know what though? i think i did fairly decent on my ef exam so... yea i don't think i'm going to do this homework assignment unless it's really easy. oh yea. i'm so pissed. i have a chem exam on thursday. i want to fucking go to a show in dc that night. dammit. oh well what can you do. all i can say is i'm excited for thanksgiving break. i'm leaving right after my exam on thursday, then i have a week and a half off. i'm excited. anyways.. so yea i'm just gonna hang out for a while  before my group project. adios."

"event","holy shit..13 days until we graduate guys.

i was just reading my old livejournals from this time last year and it's funny to see how sad i was about the boys graduating and how we only had one year left ourselves and now look at us, our time has finally come.

i know it's cliche but i never thought this day would actually come. i never thought i would finally be a senior about to embark on graduation. it's so surreal. i'm so excited to graduate and get out of this place but so sad at the same time. it's bittersweet. i'm ready to move on with the next chapter of my life but sad to leave a whole other part of it behind. friends, family, home. i've lived here in this place my entire life. i've never known anything different. no matter how much someone complains about living in this place or going to school here, we truly are blessed. it's home. and i'm damn proud to call it that.

it sucks because your years of being a kid are limited and so short yet you have forever to be an adult. it really sucks when you look at it like that and put it in perspective. we want to grow up so fast but don't stop to realize that once it's over, it's over. just like that, no turning back.

i'll leave you with a quote from my favorite movie:
""Well, all I'm saying is that I want to look back and say that I did the best I could while I was stuck in this place. Had as much fun as I could while I was stuck in this place. Played as hard as I could while I was stuck in this place..."" -Dazed and Confused"

"event","""There's never been another summer when i've ever learned so much.""


one thing i've learned this summer: when it comes to boys, don't expect anything, or get wrapped up in the romance too fast.  i knew better when that happened with shane, but i let it happen anyway, and look what happened.  that taught me right then and there not to expect anything to happen and not to let myself get caught up in it.  because all that will come of it is hurt.  that's why i'm not expecting anything now.  yeah, i like him, but i went into it not thinking that anything would come of it so i'm gonna stick with that because then it won't hurt like it would if i got wrapped up and attached.  it sucks because he's so cute and i like being around him, and he drove down to the woodlands last night even though he could only stay for a little bit and then made the two hour drive back home at like 2:30 in the morning.  but has he called me? no.  seriously, the one boy i never expected to call me this summer is the only one who's been calling me.  yeah, shane did but we were dating so he had to.  that doesn't count.  the one boy that i never thought would did. and he's the one boy that i really developed feelings for this summer that i probably shouldn't have, or that's what a lot of people seem to think.  so like i said, i learned that you can't expect anything or have expectations, because those expectations probably won't be reached, and normally it's the unexpected that happens in the end."

it really sucks to keep thinking about someone that you really don't want to be thinking about.  and when you know you shouldn't.  but i don't know, i can't help it.

applied for a lot of jobs.  i have an interview with gap body next week.  hopefully it works out cause i really need a job.  well that's what my mom tells me.

hoping this next week will go by fast. possibly cause i wanna see the person i keep thinking about.  maybe not."

called the girls in the morning after i got home.  knew jen would already be awake cause she's crazy and get's up early.  call and wake haley up.  damn lacey doesn't answer her phone so i have to leave her a message.  that bitch.  no, it's ok cause she called me back.  it was great to get to hang out with them and catch up on everything i missed back here at home with jen and hal and here about LA from lacey.  i really missed those girls.  still missing allie, alit, and emily, but at least allie gets home on thursday.  but then she has surgery the next wednesday and that sucks.

"event","okay...so i think it's safe to say that i had a pretty awesomeee weekend in LG with my girls.

friday...i leave the woodlands around 10ish and head up to LG by myself.  it was the first time in a long, long time that i've actually driven up by myself.  it was actually kind of nice, not that i don't love going up with my girls or anything, don't take it the wrong way.  it's just nice to have some alone time sometimes, you know?  anyways, i get to the house a little before 12 and i start making a picture board for andrew's grad party.  it turned out quite nice, if i do say so myself.  then i had to make his baseball scrapbook for the party as well.  it was pure and utter hell.  i didn't think i'd ever finished, and i have a new found hatred for newspaper.  anyways, my mom and the girls get to the house around 7 and i get to hang out with them, and i finally finish the scrapbook.  nothing too exciting happened friday night because me and allie had to go and take the ACT in giddings the next morning.  jen and hal got out of it. those sluts.  oh, i forgot to mention that kelly borrowed john and linda's RV for people to stay in because there were so many people staying at the house for andrew's party so us girls slept in there on friday night.  sometime around midnight i believe jen comes in and andrew follows and proceeds to come and jump on the bed and tackle me and allie and completely wake us up.  that bitch.  no, it was actually really funny cause he was really drunk and i always think it's funny to see my cousin that way.  somehow we finally manage to get him out of the RV and we go back to bed.

saturday...starts off pretty crappy cause me and allie have to get up at 7 to go take the ACT.  it wasn't that bad, and we get done around 12 15ish and head back home.  we get home and meet up with haley, jen, mikey, josh, and andrew and we start getting ready for the party and the night ahead of us.  we go to the park around 3 to hang out and help out before the party.  people start showing up around 4 30, mainly just the old people, but a few young people too.  dinner is served at 5 30 and by that time the kids start showing up, thank god.  sometime around there shane shows up, and in jen's terms 'avoids me like the plague.'  seriously.  then i see kelsey and say hey to him, but instead of saying hi back he looks at me, makes a little 'ha' sound, and turns away.  i know, rude huh?  so that kind of pisses me off but whatever. the DJ brings out the karoeke (sp?) around 8ish.  me and the girls sang 'friends in low places' with some of the boys and then sang a special tribute of 'natural woman' to andrew.  then allie has to leave and we say our goodbyes to her which made us sad for a little bit.  the party really starts to pick up around 9 or 9 30.  somtime after that haley goes over to kelsey to see if he'll talk to her and he does and says that she's the only one that he's not pissed off at.  he's mad at jen cause of what happened with her and andrew last time and then he's mad at me because of the bet me and him made last time. (last time  was at graduation and me and kelsey made a bet that i wouldn't kiss him that night and he didn't think it was going to happen and he tells andrew that it will only take him 30 minutes and i heard him so it really pissed me off and i totally won that bet.  then he ends up spending the night at andrew's and trys to hook up with me and i continue to reject him and it pissed him off cause our bet was over by that time)  so that's why he was mad at me, because i rejected him last time.  i thought it was kind of funny. so i go over and we talk and he tells me why he's mad and gives me a hard time saying 'why don't i go talk to shane' or whatever but we talk it all out and everything's fine.  so then we go and dance.  then i dance with hickle, jerry, camron, and adam.  yeah my dance with adam was kind of a shock.  we're dancing and talking and somewhere in there i tell him that he owes me and dance because we only danced to like two songs together at prom.  he stops, puts his hands on my shoulders, looks me straight in the eye, and tells me that he's really sorry for the way that he acted at prom and that he knows he was a terrible date and that i probably hate him and when i tell him it's ok he tells me it's not and there's no excuse for the way he acted and that he'll make it up to me..tonight.  i was like uh, no that's ok adam haha. apparently he was serious, whatever.  but yeah, it was a pleasant surprise, i really wasn't expecting and apology from him.  i guess it was my night for apologies or something cause then shane comes up to me and tells me how sorry he is for being such an asshole for everything and how he really wants to be my friend and so on.  so it was really nice to hear that too.  around the end of the party jen gets nathan whish is awesomeee cause he is quite good looking and a nice guy.  so the party finally ends at midnight and we go back to andrew's.  apparently everyone decides to move the party back to andrew's cause like 20 trucks pull up right after we get home.  it was quite fun, except for the fact that jen passed out after like 20 mintues, but it's cool.  so haley and sean are together for the night, of course, and then me and kelsey somehow end up together.  i don't know how that boy manages to do that. i don't know if he has a hold on me, or if i have a hold on him. maybe we both have a hold on one another? i dunno. whatever it is, it's got to stop.  me and haley finally go to bed while everyone else stays up and parties. now that i think about it, that was pretty stupid. damnit. 

sunday...wake up this morning around 9 and quite a few people had left a little earlier so when we go inside it's only matt, jerry, andrew, john, mikey, camron, candi, and ashley.  they all wake up and we hang out with them for a little and then we left to go home at 11.

all in all it was quite the weekend and a lot of fun amd successful as well.  i love my girls!"

so shane left on sunday.  already knew that.  well he called me when he got home and i was taking a nap so he told me to call him when i woke up.  he told me he was going to marsha's so he might not have service when i call.  so i text him a little while after i get up and he says he's still there and that he'll just call me when he leaves if it's not too late.  well he leaves around midnight and he has work the next morning so i tell him i'll talk to him the next day.  so then it's monday.  he calls me when he gets off of work as usual and we talk for about 15 minutes when he has to go eat dinner and he says he'll call me back later.  he never does, but we come to find out that something is wrong with his phone cause he sent me 3 text messages and called me and none of it went through.  he calls on tuesday and he's in a bad mood for one reason or another so we only talk for like 45 minutes.  in that 45 minutes of talking i found it kind of awkward.  i didn't know what to say, not like the week before when we talked for at least 2 hours every night and the conversation flowed so well.  he calls me yesterday when he gets off of work and him and the guys are going to the river to build a slip 'n slide but he says he'll call me when their done.  he calls a few hours later, trashed, tells me all about it, and says their going to their friends to play washers but he'll call me when they're done.  yeah, he never called.  

so that brings us to today.  i wake up to a text message from him this morning that says 'we need to talk about something when you wake up.'  i was like hmmm, it doesn't take a genius to figure this one out.  i respond with a 'what?' and he sends a text back saying something along the lines that this isn't going to work, he just wants to be friends, blah blah blah.  you'd think that i would have been really upset, but i wasn't.  now if this would have happened last week, i would be in bed, crying and feeling sorry for myself right about now.  but something changed this week, and i'm not quite sure what it is.  maybe it's that whole women's intuition thing but something inside of me just told me to be careful and guarded.  and i did, and thank god for that.  i am so happy that i kept telling myself to not really like him, because if i wouldn't have i think i'd be pretty upset right now and pretty attached as well.  

it turns out thought that shane wasn't completely honest with me.  a boy lied, imagine that.  apparently sean told haley and she relayed the message back to me that shane's been talking to his ex-girlfriend this week.  that night when he was in a bad mood, yeah he was talking to her.  last night when he didn't call me back, he went and saw her.  i think sean and haley are more pissed off then i am.  good, i need someone to make him feel like shit, and who better to do it then his own twin brother.  yeah, then sean tells haley that shane might not even go to andrew's graduation party tomorrow.  seriously, is he going to be that immature about it?  if anyone should be immature in this situation it should be me, but no, i'm handling this in a very mature nature.  typical boy.

oh well, tonight me and the girls are going to mi luna for a little salsa dancing and i'm really excited.  sad at the same time though because this is our little goodbye party because everyone is about to go off on their own, separate ways.  lacey leaves tomorrow for l.a., allie to ecuador and alit to camp on sunday, and me to hawaii on tuesday.  then jen and haley don't leave too long after that.  we'll make it though, it'll just be that much sweeter when we all get back and see each other again.  

and this weekend is gonna kick ass.  andrew's graduation is going to be so awesomeee, and i'm going to look so hot so shane better be there, and he's going to regret what he did.  i love it!!

and now i'm done."

"event","so i just got home from hanging out with the girls.  of course when am i not hanging out with them.  i love them so much.  i honestly do not know what i would do if i didn't have them in my life.  they mean so much to me.  we all met up at coldstone, except for allie but she was there in spirit and we still love her.  emily's leaving tomorrow for europe so we had to say our goodbyes to her.  it was sad, but she's gonna have such an amazing time. i'm jealous.  those european boys are quite attractive.  anyways, we all decided that we're going to mail each other letters and little care packages over the summer from all the different places each one of us goes to.  i'm really excited.  most of us are out of town around the same time so that's a good thing cause we don't have to be here at home for long without one another, thank god.  i'll tell you what, those six girls are the best friends i could ever ask for.  i don't know what i did to deserve them but whatever i did i thank god.  i love you girls!!

so on the way to coldstone i was talking to haley.  ok first let me back it up.  last night i got upset cause shane called me when he got off of work but he had to go eat dinner after being on the phone for like 15 minutes but he said he would call me back.  well he never did.  so i got upset about it.  yeah, so i get a text from him this morning saying that he called me and texted me 3 times last night but his phone says that none of them went through.  and now he's pissed cause it means that his phone is screwed up.  it sucks that his phone is messed up but it made me happy and relieved.  so then he calls me tonight and apparently he feels like shit for one reason or another and so then i get in a bad mood too.  ok so this is where i talk to haley about it on the way to coldstone and i came to the conclusion that the reason why i'm getting upset and angry so easily in this situation is because i'm scared.  plain and simple.  i'm scared that it isn't going to work out or that he's going to lose interest in me or that i'm going to get hurt.  so i get worked up and worried about the littlest thngs. i hate that i do that but i can't help it.  it's like a defense mechanism or something, i dunno.  i seriously need to just let my guard down and see what happens.  cause whatever happens, happens, plain and simple.  i just hope everything happens the way i want it to.

i have to turn in the rest of my job applications tomorrow.  i better get a job from one of the ten places i applied to or else i'll be pissed.  then it's off to the dentist, oh boy.  

wow...i am so ready for this weekend."

"event","well..its the start to another wonderful week of summer.  it's only the start of the second week, but it feels like school was so long ago already.  i love it!  

this weekend was fun.  had the SAT on saturday morning.  that part was not fun.  once that SAT was over, i went back home and got ready, then haley came over and we hung out at my house.  then shane and sean came!  we went to the mall, then back to my house, then to the grocery store, then to allie's for a bbq.  somewhere in there sean had to go meet haley's family.  i think she was quite worried about this.  after allie's we came back to my house and watched dazed and confused.  aka the best movie ever.

sunday...ok so those boys wake up early no matter how late they stay up or anything.  im pretty sure that they were both up by 7.  i got up at 8:45 (my definition of early, especially in the summer) but only cause my mom woke me up to come and eat breakfast.  we finally got haley up around 9:30ish.  we layed around for awhile and then we went to see kicking and screaming, which was very funny actually.  i knew it would be though, i mean after all will ferrell is in it.  then we came back to my house and the boys left.  didn't really want them to but they had work today so yeah.

now it's monday.  i have to babysit for a few hours today, and then it's off to get my senior picture taken at the high school for the yearbook.  seriously, when we got out for summer break i had no idea i was going to be spending this much time at the high school.  

but yeah, i'm trying to convince myself that i don't really like shane. it's not working.  i really like him, but i don't want to really like him.  i'm too scared to get caught up in something again and then be hurt in the end.  screw it.  sometimes you just have to let your guard down and go with it.  that's what i'm going to do.  maybe it's just a summer fling or maybe it will last, i guess we'll see what happens.

andrew's graduation party is on saturday!  i'm so unbelievably excited.  it's going to be such a good time, minus the ACT i have to take, in giddings, on saturday.

ladiesss...summer '05 is definitely going to be our summer."

"event","wow...only 1 day left.  1 day and i'm a senior! it's about damn time.  today was the seniors last day at school.  that's sad, no more of seeing them around, the school is gonna be half empty tomorrow, weird.  of course i forgot to bring my camera to school today.  i would do something like that.  it's so crazy, this time next year we'll be the ones graduating.  okay, im gonna try and not think about that for now.  

tomorrow should be a pretty good day, though.  i have one final.  which sucks, especially because it's spanish.  gosh, that's that only final i have but it's the only one i really didn't want to take.  don't you love how things work out that way.  after school i think me and the girls are gonna go and lay out at alit's pool.  that will be nice.  gotta get a little tan before the big graduation.  man, i can already feel the tears coming on.

1 MORE DAY...AWESOMEEE!"

"event","holy shit..only 3 more days of school left and then i'm a senior!  wow, that's really mind boggling.  it's weird to think that my high school career is one year shy of coming to an end.  it seems like only yesterday that we were mere, lowly freshman.  and here we are, soon to be the best of the best.  it's kind of a bittersweet kind of deal i guess.  i was telling the girls yesterday that it sucks because your years of being a kid are limited and so short yet you have forever to be an adult.  it really sucks when you look at it like that and put it in perspective.  we want to grow up so fast but don't stop to realize that once it's over, it's over.  just like that, no turning back.

with the end of school comes graduation.  i know i know, i'm not graduating this year but i have a lot of friends who are, including my cousin andrew.  i'm so happy for him to be moving on with his life because i know he's going to be great, but i'm also really sad.  i know it might sound selfish but i don't want andrew to grow up and leave.  i want him to stay right where he is right now.  i don't want things to change.  in our seventeen years of being together i'm just now realizing how much he really means to me.  andrew's not just my cousin, he's my friend.  my best friend.  he might as well be my brother.  i trust him with everything and he's always there to protect me and look out for me.  sure we can argue for hours on end, but in the end i know that he'll always be there for me no matter what.  it's taking him graduating to make me realize that soon i wont be able to just go up and hang out with him whenever i want.  he's not going to be there like he is now.  i'm so incredibly proud of them though.  when it comes down to it he has turned out to be an amazing young man.  any of you ladies out there would be lucky to have him.  

okay...so graduation is going to be sad, but as jen would say we're gonna tear that shit up and i must agree with her on that.  we gotta make the best of the time we have left with the boys and with each other.  but ladies...this is gonna be our summer...i can already tell!!


3 DAYSSSS...AWESOMEEE!"

"event","well, i just read haley's live journal and what can i say, it made me sad.  i mean it's been 2 days since the game but it still sucks, thats the only word i can think of to describe it right now.  obviously i don't live there and it doesn't mean as much to me as it does to the boys, but i've been going to their games since they were like 12, even before that.  and now it's over.  its like the end of an era.  however cheesy or corny that might sound.  but it wasn't just baseball, you know?  it was more than that, we had some really great times with it over the years.  and now it's never gonna be like that again.  it's sad but i'll get over it and move on 'cause hey, graduation is just 4 days away! hell yes!  but i'm thinking that if the baseball game made me cry, there will most likely be some tears at graduation.  oh well, it'll still definitely be a hell of a good time!"

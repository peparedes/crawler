"event","Oh, a moment to myself. How novel. Actually, I have been meaning to write again as I know I've been quite slack in doing so. I would like to say it is because of a good cause, I am not so certain however. 

Social events, parties, and large gatherings of the sorts...

I think I dislike them almost as much I as I dislike those Iscariot swine. 


But when one is summoned by the Queen to be in attendence at a particular series of events, one cannot refuse.

Puh.Holy Knights do <i>not</i> wear dresses.  

I would rather be exterminating the evil undead--Or Catholics. 


UGH.

Thankfully it will all be over soon.."

"event","Someone has been keeping something from me and I do not think I like it. Actually, I know I do not like and and I am right annoyed. 
Oh I am fully aware that there are countless other nasties that need to be delt with, that I should be thinking about instead.. But there is something very strage occuring. And when I mean strange, I mean that it has little to do with the wandering legions of undead creatures that I deal with on a regular basis. And it was not until I noticed a subtle difference in the world around me, that I came to realize that perhaps this has been going on right under my nose for quite some time now. 
London is the same as ever, and it's people are just as odd and colourful as ever--But something I fear is well...Off.

...And that bastard servant of mine hasn't had the courtesy to even fucking mention it to me. 

Well. We will see about that. I fully intend to get to the bottom of this. But first, more tea. And a smoke too, I feel."

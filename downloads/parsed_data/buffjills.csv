"event","Wow !!  It's been forever since I have written in here !!!  So much has happened !!!  We moved out of our Frederick Street house....in June...with no luck finding a place before we moved :  (   My sister Jean invited us to stay with her and her boyfriend Randy , his tow boys , Sean 16 and Tyler, recently turned 14...HAPPY BIRTHDAT TYLER !!!!   :  )  And my mom .   Cool...figure we would be there three days...one week tops .  How does 74 days sound ?  UGH !!!!!  The kids and I packed clothes for three days...everything else was put in storage or in my sister's basement.  Can you imagine being 13 and 15 and starting school...and the first week you basicaly have to wear at least one set of clothes twice ?  Sure it happens...some are not as fortunate to have a change of clothes for everyday....but for those who do and you can't get to them...and it goes on for another 30 days...UGH !!!  I know..if that was MY ONLY problem !!!   I was still working ...YAY !!!  Even Danielle joined the crew of Marine Detailers :  )   It is ....was...great to have her on board :  )   Our boss likes her work so the job is there for next season if she wants it.  I hope she does find something she REALLY LIKES between now and then tho'   :  )     Anyway...we are living at Jeannies...helping out...cooking , cleaning, helping take care of my mom...she is paralized from the waist down and in a wheelchair . We all had our chores , and we all did them..with smiles on our faces :  )   We even did more .  Still , for some reason , my sister was not happy .  She wanted us out ..and that's all there was to it !!  Believe me , we did not plan on staying there more than a week , let alone 74 days !!!  She , my sister , started saying everyday "" I do not want my sister ( ME ) , to hate me...I may need her help 5 years down the road and if she hates me she won't be there for me "" .   She then told Sean and Tyler and Danielle , Samantha and NIck , that she was going to make life miserable for us so we move out faster .  Oops , I guess i skipped something .  We looked for a place almost everyday...had been looking two months before our lease ran out in June .  I kept getting the same result..too small...no pets....I do not make enough money...DENIED .  You see , they want you to gross 3 times the amount of the monthly rent....who does that ???  WHO has that ???  I needed a private owner , and I needed them QUICK !!!  Wasn't happening !!!  It was sad to go back to Jeannies after looking for a place , being denied because I did not make enough money , tell my sister and mother about it...almost in tears..and they look at you like they don't believe you .  That is why my sister told the kids she was going to make our lives miserable so we move out faster...she did not believe we were looking.  Sucks when a stranger tells you "" NO "" , but it sticks like a KNIFE when your sister doesn't believe you !!!  She did try to make our lives miserable...she succeeded...although I asked Samantha , Nick and Danielle not to show their emotions...don't let her see that she is succeeding .  Have fun with Sean and Tyler :  ) Enjoy their company .  That seemed to make it ""barable"" for them...I know it did me...and I was gone for 8 hours a day working !!!!  They even had a ""Family Meeting"" while I was at work...and my mother ...their Grandmother had the nerve to tell MY CHILDREN that they were not Wlodyka's...my last name...MY father's name.  Made me mad .... oh yea.  I did not say anything right away .  I was hoping a time would come when I could say something . And it did :  )  My mother came into the kitchen one day...asking me what was wrong with her...why Sean and Tyler ""seemed"" to love her more than her own Grandchildren .  I said let me think....nothing wrong with you mom .  MMMMMMMMMM...maybe it was something you said. Oh yes...you did tell my children they are not Wlodyka's .  I'm sure that hurt them very much .  We were told no computer after 9 ...and we couldn't be in the boys room unless they were in there with us .  Still my kids smiled :  )   I LOVE THEM !!!  They are the GREATEST !!!  I have been truely BLESSED !!!  :  )  Well, after searching for months...we finally found a place !!!  Actually I should say that one of my bosses found me a place !!!  I was working three jobs at one point while we were living at Jeannies....and one of my bosses Donnie and Mary gave me a number to a realtor and she found us a private owner :  )  It's a cute little place...three bedrooms...one bathroom sucks...but it is not my sisters house !!!  YAY !!!! We have horses ...4 of them..and a donkey as neighbors :  )  Ace, Rebel are the boys...Barney is the donkey :  )  And Sugar and Jeannie ( go figure ) , are the girls...they are both pregneant...due in the spring :  )  What an experience the kids are going to see :  )   Well ,they won't actually see the birth...but they will see the litle colt or filly....it'll be so cool  :  )    Dee and I are still very much in love...and our love is growing stronger everyday :  )   He has been here twice since I last wrote...coming again in 5 days :  )   I was there...Buffalo in June :  )  Before we moved out .   I love him very much !!!  He makes me very happy !!!  The children are the best thing that ever happened to me, he is the next best thing :  )    Life has been good to me  :  )  5 beautiful children , a man who loves me , treats me like a Queen....I am a very lucky woman .  :   )"

"event","Well, Dee ( Don ) was here on the 18th of February  :  )    We had a really good time :  )   He brought his 12 year old daughter , Jackie with him.....she has discipline issues...to put it mildly !!  We , Dee and I , to Atlantic City on the 22nd to the 23rd.  I had a great time  :  )  We stayed at a Hotel called the Flagship. Nice hotel. It was on the Boardwalk....which we walked a little bit on...it was cold and windy , so we didn't go far.  We went to the Borgata Casino...first casino I have been in.  I played slot machines ...won $25.00 on $5.00.  Dee just put it back into the machine ....and of course I lost it .  We were there about 4 hours. We ate there....buffet.  I had prime rib...my first time eating prime rib...YUM  :   )   I also had a piece of chicken, a salad and broccolli .  Don had meat loaf, steak, shrimp , sweet potatoes and regular mashed potatoes.  I had a brownie and chocolate ice cream for dessert. Don had a whole bunch of desserts , which he shared with me.....YUM  :  )   We sat next to each other everywhere we went and held hands and kissed...it was very romantic :  )   We then went to Donald Trumps two casinos...very nice.  We saw the cement hand prints of some stars.   Very impressive :  )   We only gambled a little bit in those casinos...Mr. Trump has enough money !!!   We went to the Sands...that was ok.  I had a lot of fun at the Borgata .....although the Trump casinos were much more exotic.  We took a small bus called a Jitney wherever we didn't walk.  It was pretty neat  :  )    We got back to the Hotel around 10:30.....got up around 9 and checked out around 10:30.  We hada  a lot of fun !!!  We want to go back...but we want to spend more than just one day there ....I hope it is soon :  )   I have such a fun time with Don.  He makes me feel very special and very loved.   He was here a week....left last Saturday :  (      I am hoping to get some day soff in the early summer and fly to Buffalo to visit with him.  It is my turn...he has come here twice  :  )    

I am back to working almost everyday...it is great to be back working !!!  Although right now it is not 8 hours a day...it is better than nothing !!!  Rick told me that we should start hitting those 40 hour weeks in the beginning of March...which is tomorrow !!!   :  )   

I guess that is it for now...off to watch American Idol...then off to bed....been a busy week and it is only Tuesday !!!!"

"event","I almost forgot to tell about the kids and my weekend !!!  My son CJ...he is 19 and still in Texas...going to college...I miss him  :  (     Anyway....he sent us $50.00 for Christmas to do something as a family . Well we all decided on the movies.....now what movie to see.  Nick wants to see Fun With Dick and Jane, Samantha and Danielle want to see ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" .   Well....we all decided on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  We went this past saturday...teh movie theatre is in Delaware...about 20 minutes from here.  It was a good movie :  )   I read th ebook ,so I liked the book more ....the movie left out too much important info....BUT it is a long book and you can't put  all of that into a movie !!!!   After the movie the kids played Arcade games that are in the theatre....then we went to Taco Bell for dinner.....we got home around 9:00 ......it was a great Saturday !!!   :   )   We are hoping to do it agian soon....this time the kids can see the movies they wanted to see.....I find something to do  ;  )      I figure as soon as I am back to full time at the Marina , these types of weekends will happen more often  :  )"

"event","WOW ....two days in a row....I hope I don't shock anyone !!!   ;   )      I had to say why Nightwish and Majic will be with us soon and about love....which I am deeply in right now :  )     We are looking to buy a house :  )   The rent around here is rediculous...it's basically the same as  a mortgage, so why not put my money into something I own ?   Danielle and I looked at a house today....4 bedrooms , 2 1/2 bathrooms , 2 ""living rooms"" , a dinning room , kitchen , .89 acres of land....basement , attic.....2 car garage.....nice hosue.  They are asking $384.900.00 .  Good price IF the house was a bit bigger.....if the rooms were about 5-10 feet bigger......if you put a bed and a dresser in there , you have no bedroom left !!!  I don't know about anyone else , but I have more than a bed and a dresser to put in my room !!!!   Computer, stereo and other personal objects !!!!   The realtor gave us a magazine of houses that are for sale in this area and he said if we find anything we like give him a call and he will come out and help us !!!  Real nice guy !  Hopefully we will beable to find a house just like Danille and I looked at today , but bigger :  )    

The love bug has bit me.  I am very happy :  )  I feel like a school girl  :  )  His name is Don. I have known him for 25 1/2 years. The kids dad and him were friends in school....I met him back in 1980.  About a year before we went to Texas.  We would write letters back and forth....as friends....I would update him on my kids and he woulod update me on his kids.  Then we got a phone and we would talk on the phone twice a month, plus the letters..as friends.  Then I got a computer and we would email almost everyday....as friends !!!!    :   )    Well, about 4 months ago , he asked me out on a date !!  Oh, he lives in Buffalo New York.  I was like where is this coming from...we are friends !  I said yes ...then he started telling me that he has liked me , more than a friend since he met me !!!!   I was shocked !!!!   He told me a lot of things that shocked the heck out of me.....but I am very happy he told me them :  )   He is very romantic....good with words...and a great kisser  :  )    He spent the weekend of January 13th here....we had a real good time !!!   :   )   No , I do not kiss and tell ;   )   The kids weren't oo happy with his visit...they thought...and I did too, that Don was here to get to knwo them.....instead he spent all of his time with me....and I am not complaining :   )    I found out from another male friend of mine that men cannot  multitask.....when they are starting a relationship that involves children, they concentrate on the woman for the first couple of ""visits"" and then they get to know her children....they can't do both .  Sounds reasonable to me :  )  I am just really happy that he asked me out :  )   I am very much in love with this man :   )   I haven't been this happy in a VERY LONG time....well, happy about a man anyway :  )  Oh yea, before I go, he has very sexy blue eyes  :  )"

"event","Wow...it has been a long time since I have updated my LJ !!!   Well, I lived through Bozo brain  :  )    We left Texas on June 25th ....by Amtrak and arrived safely in Maryland on the 28th  :  )     The train ride was great !!  Bumpy in some places, but that is to be expected  :  )   Danielle and Nick played cards or duelled....can't rememebr which...maybe it was both  :  )    Samantha and I talked , or looked at the view.....I fell asleep on the train...didn't think I  would beable to, but I must have been very tired !!!   We hit rain just before entering Chicago.  Danielle and Nick slepted through that .  We were late getting into Chicago...stayed there a little bit longer than we were suppose to...the train we were suppose to get on was late.   Then we went slowly through Pennsylvannia...we thought it was because of train back up , but one of the Porters said it was because the tracks are in need of desperate repair and in soem areas they have to go real slow.  We were about 6 hours late getting into Washington.....then we headed up to Baltimore where  my sister Jeannie picked us up.  We stayed at her house for four days before we finally found a place of our own.  It is about 5 houses up the street from Jeannies.  It is a 3 bedroom, 2 bath , red brick house ....the house is ok, but  NO PETS.  My fault and my sisters fault. She, my sister told me to lie to the landlord about having pets cause she wanted us to get the place....so now Jeannie has the cats...Majic and Nightwish.  I miss them terribly, BUT soon they will be back with us :  )   YAY !!!   More on that later  :  )   I never got my job at Walmart....as a matter of fact I didn't get a job for 2 months after we got here. Jeannie paid for everything !!!  At one point I owed her over $8,000.00 !!!   UGH !!!   She had all my utilities turned, got me a van, got me insurance....house and vehicle....paid for my groceries.  Danielle sold her car and at one point was able to buy us groceries  :  )   I owe Danielle $1,065.00 .....good thing this does not go on my credit report !!!  Well, I was getting pretty depressed about the whole job thing...I was filling out applications everywhere !!!  But being that I have been a stay at hoem mom for 23 years and did not have a reference since the late 70's early 80's, no one wanted to hire me.  BUT, one day Jeannie asked me iof I wanted to go to school with her to pick up her books...she is taking Nursing in College  :  )   I said sure why not.  Well , there was a bulliten board right next to the book store , and on it was a ad for Boat Detailers.  Jeannie asked if I wanted to try that...I said I don't know anything about that....she said give it a try...I said sure.  I called Rick and boy oh boy am I glad I did :  )   He was hesitant when I told him my age....I was 46 when I made that call.  He asked if I could handle the hard work...I said look , I have been a stay at home mom for 23 years of 5 children...can you find a harder job ?   He liked that  :  )   Then he said it gets really hot in the summer...this is an outside job.....I said , I just spent 23 years in Houston, Texas....does it get any hotter than that ?  He liked that too :  )  We eneded up talking for about 30 more minutes....I went in the next day for my interview and I was hired on the spot  :  )  Within 3 weeks I got my first raise and with 3 months I got two more raises :  )  I LOVE this job !!!  It is outside ....I wash and wax Yachts  :  )   Rich people  ;  )   Can't clean their own boats...BUT then again ,I wouldn't have a job if they did !!!  I am grateful   :  )    Let's see....the Marina I work at shut the water off in November...late November , so I have been doing odd jobs since then to pay the bills....cleaning houses mostly.  It is a pretty good job, but I can't wait till the Marina opens up full time in March  :  )     I have more to say, but I want to send this off before my comp freezes  :  (        I am glad I moved...best decision I have made so far in my life  :   )"

Basically, you're brave, daring, chivalrous, and pretty much.. an all
around good person. Of course, some see you as a goodie-two-shoes. But
hey, it's true! You're really good at winning, and normally always come
out as the hero. Everybody likes you.. except, maybe, the Slytherins.
You're too perfect. No, really.. You're <i>too</i> perfect. It's annoying to watch you win, <i>repeatedly</i>. Oh well. Be proud anyway.<br><br>

"event","I have had it !  I can't win for losing !  This man is driving me CRAZY !!  I was pouring me a bowl of Cheerios for breakfast. He watched me do it...as soon as I poured the milk in it , he asked if I could help him.  I said can you wait ten minutes...he said forget it.  ATTITUDE !  So, I of course dumped out my cereal and went and helped him...hey I have to spend 12 more days with this man...I want it to be in peace.   Throughout the day he was saying is this mine ?  I said no, you told me I could have it...he'd get pissed and start cussing.  I only gave into the clock...sorry Danielle.  I almost gave into everything, but I held my ground.  The 28th cannot come fast enough !!   He wants me to wait a year for him...what is he crazy ?   I told him no...we are finished.   He is drinking like beer is going to be outlawed tomorrow...and then making life miserable for me.   He then , naturally , apologizes for what he said...too late...damage done.  He wants to take away our internet....sorry CJ is paying for that...you can't....he was lost for words on that one.....well he did mumble something under his breath.   Right before he went to sleep tonight , he started complaining about EVERYTHING....peanuts...where are the peanuts..I did buy peanuts didn't I ?  Your pork roast sucked...CJ's couch sucks....you are not waiting to the last day to disasemble Danielle's room.   Why not ?  Where are we suppose to put her desk and bed and her kitty's and all her boxes ...her computer....I have had it !!!!   I wanted to put a lightbulb in Danielle's light....he got ""mad"" over that.  I have so much to say and I am so mad I can't remember half the stuff I want to say !! I have woken up with a headache everyday since he has been here...I feel like I am going to have an anxiety attack everyday since he has been here.  Someone please tell me to take a deep breath and say it's only 11 more days....or tell me to go put in Pirates Of The Carribean and watch Captain Jack Sparrow : )    Thanks for listening :  )"

Samantha and Nick have most of their stuff packed up ...just have to finish up their closet.  Danielle needs to get going on her room...which I want to help her with...then it won't seem as so much to her....just like I had Samantha's help  : )      cliff will be here June 11th   :  (     Not looking forward to that at all.  I don't know why he is coming so soon....there is nothing for him to do here. He says he wants to spend time with his children before we go, but yet he has all these jobs lined up to keep him busy and earn money while he is here....you go figure cuz after 30 years , I still can't figure him out.    Well, June 28th is coming fast, and I can't wait to get on that train and say good bye to Texas....and cliff.    If we have any people look at the house this weekend, they ain't going to be too happy....I have boxes everywhere !!

I feel real good about having most of the packing doen already and it's only the 3rd !!!  YAY me !!  And Samantha and Nick !!!  Still no place to live...but if all goes well, that may change Monday !!  :  )   Fingers crossed...prayers, please !!

""is the house clean"" ?  he asks about a few bills that have been paid. i told him the realtor wants the furniture moved out of the kids bedrooms...he agrees....of course.   and put it where ?..i say...  let's see...i'm sure the realtor would say it's ok to leave the beds in there , so we are looking at 4 dressers, two desks .....that are beds to computers. ok we have dressers that have tv's on them, desks that have tv's, comp. , PS2 , VCR...on them..what are we suppose to do with all of that ? put it on the floor...pack them away...i don't think so !  then daddio goes on to say that he wants to have a party the weekend before we leave.  that's the 26th and 27th....we are leaving the 28th.  i am going to be so busy that weekend...my sister arrives the 27th...to load up the truck and driver her out of here.  then he goes back to getting the furniture out of the rooms. then he goes  to making sure i am cleaning the house. &%$@ &*@ !!!!!!!!!!!!!! then he goes onto other things that are in the progresss of gettting done or are done...... then he said ""i hate to be the Sergant here...i said,"" to who""...he said ""to you "" .  i said ""i gotta go"" and hung up .   what pisses me off the most is that dildo puss has known me since 1975.   the conversations that we have had are not neccessary.  he knows every question he asks has already been done or is being done.  i have more stress talking to him , then all of the stuff i have done in my lifetime !!    crap.  there is so much more to read in between the lines....sucks.  Girls, if family and you are not on the top of his priority list, he ain't worth the time of day. shoot , same message to all you guys out there."

"event","I have basically told all my friends that I am leaving Texas . Everyone has been very supportive , most of them told me this was the smartest thing to do !!  I have one last person to tell, Mike.  He is going to be a tough one to tell .  Him and I are very close friends. I am waiting for him to return my call and I am not looking forward to this conversation. I think I have been more stressed out telling people that I have known for 20 years that I will know longer see them , then I am about leaving cliff and Texas.  I hope I can still keep in touch with my friends, if not by email, then by  good ol snail mail !   :  )      I will miss everyone  :   ("

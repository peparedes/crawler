"event","So, today marks the tipping point where Chris and I have been together and married for more years than we were together and unmarried. Eight years ago today we threw a big party on a mountain and made it official. We had found out the week before the wedding that I was pregnant with Jonah (and I swear it was after we had already ordered the Simpsons replica ""Whale of a Wife"" cake as the groom's cake). Three weeks after the wedding, Chris would be offered a job at Vanderbilt and we started preparing to move to Nashville. By the end of June, we were in a townhouse in Brentwood. By the middle of August, we had closed on our first house, followed by a solid month of painting and ripping out carpet and mini blinds and wallpaper borders that were installed over even older wallpaper borders and the initialization of Operation Brass Eradication (which as of last month, we are closer than ever before).

Now, that fetus is about to finish first grade and we're thinking, ""oh shit, shouldn't we really be closing in on that ten year plan of goats and guns?!""

Almost fourteen years since we met. It hasn't all been unicorns and rainbows, but it mostly is right now and that's what really matters."

"event","I'm in the market for a room. It can be a space in someone's room or an individual room. Chris wants to go, so he's said if I can find a room and make him a new set of Wolverine claws, then HOBBITON, IT'S ON!!!

Oh wait, no. That's AL3P at the end of September.

Anyway, if anyone has or hears of a spare room or space for two in someone's room in one of the host hotels, please direct them towards me. I haven't added my name to the hotels community yet to see about a transfer from a stranger yet and I don't know that I will, honestly. But if a friend has a room that I can get, I'll consider it a go. With so much else going on, it's sort of a halfhearted attempt. I'd love to go, but it's going to mean things getting even more fast paced than they already are. Unless I just wear all my AL3P stuff to Dragon*Con, though people will just assume Celebrian is Galadriel, probably. Plus I have Black Widow. She only needs very minor repairs/upgrading to be ready for wear again. Everything else is too big or in bad need of repair. 

In fact, I think I'm about to donate Elseworld Batgirl 1.0 to the group of burners who are doing the Tennessee regional version of Burning Man. The Nashville theme camp is ""Tilted Hanger"" which is a costuming themed camp where they plan to gift costumes and accessories to random people who visit the camp over the weekend. Evidently there's a big group from NYC called Kostume Kult who does this at the real deal Burning Man. But, I digress.

Dragon*Con. Room search. Please and thank you. But if I don't find one, no biggie. I'll see you guys next year for sure."

"event","The jewelry thing is rolling. It is slowly but surely building steam. I've got several shows lined up and a few commissions in the pipeline and I'm shipping out Etsy sales more regularly. I just ran a half marathon over the weekend and am looking for the next race so that I'll keep running. I think I might start transitioning to trail running for the summer. I started another round of 101 burlesque last week. I've turned down or at least deferred a couple of costume commissions lately and there's another one I'm now considering as I do some preliminary research on it just to see if I can do it. I'm also waiting to hear back on their timeline to see if it's even feasible. Then there's AL3P costuming I need to start like months ago, probably. I'm about to start laying down a short story I outlined last year. Oh, right and it's April, which means gardening needs to happen at some point.

I'm reeling just thinking about all those things at once. But this is what I wanted, right? This is what success looks like. And it's only going to get more packed as things continue to grow and build. I have to learn to juggle while walking on a balance beam, essentially.

By the way, if any of my Star Trek costuming friends have some helpful resources on making a Next Generation men's gold uniform top (not the spandex jumpsuit from earlier seasons, but the shoulder-pad-errific two piece wool ones from like season 4 and later), I'd love to have your input, fabric suggestions, etc! I never watched much Trek and definitely not much TNG, so I'm starting from the ground up here. I've found the pattern on roddenberry.com and haven't even begun to dive into the resources on the Starfleet 1701st forums yet."

"event","Burlesque. Burlesque is going on. I just wrapped up my second semester of a 101 class last night. We did a fun boa routine to the Flying Lizards version of Money (That's What I Want), which I mostly know from this scene in Empire Records (apart from more widely known Beatles version, of course):

<lj-embed id=""21""/>

For the first time since I started this little endeavor, I feel like I'm starting to come into my own with it. I'm feeling a little more confident (with a long way to go still). I don't feel stupid practicing the same moves and transitions for hours and not getting them. I'm getting them now and to the point that I'm able to stop being so hyper-focused on nailing the move that I can inject a little personality into it. I'm still not sure who Morwen Nouveau is, but at least I'm feeling like she's not a lost cause. 

After I finished 201 a little over a year ago, I wasn't sure I was ever going to really get this stuff and I set it aside. I've never really been a dancer, at least not in the traditional/trained sense (certainly in an intuitive sense, though). But I feel like I'm ready to put in some work to bridge that gap between being an intuitive dancer and one who knows what she's going to do before she does it. I was never terribly good at studying outside of class, but I'm going to have to with this. I did this semester and it really paid off. Going to more performances as a spectator will help, too because it builds my excitement for it and it gives me a broader range of ideas about what's possible.

I took Chris to <a href=""http://www.marathonmusicworks.com/event/453359-beer-bacon-burlesque-nashville/"">Beer, Bacon, and Burlesque</a> a couple of weeks ago for his birthday. It was a lot of fun as soon as we stopped seeing it as a beer festival. We settled into drinking <a href=""http://www.blackabbeybrewing.com/main/black-abbey-beers/"">Black Abbey</a> (our homebrew friends who went pro) all day and just enjoyed the performances.  Both of my burlesque instructors and my future pole dancing instructor performed in the various sets. 

Chris and I were completely blown away by Alethea Austin (the pole dancer. As in <a href=""http://www.aletheaaustin.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=4&amp;zenid=6e59622d973ea847a80bb0e2770ea29a"">THE Pole Dancer</a> [probably NSFW].) The flexibility and upper body strength she exhibited was nothing short of superhuman. I'm quite intimidated to step into a studio with her, but she's also really sweet. I bought 6 class credits on a Living Social deal when my burlesque instructor posted about it. *gulp* Here's a little sample of her in the studio:

<lj-cut text=""Also probably NSFW, but short and sweet and indicative of her skill.""><lj-embed id=""22""/></lj-cut>

Also, when I talked to Shan after her performance, she informed Chris that they're <strike>trying</strike> going to get me up on stage. *double gulp* I got to meet her awesome boyfriend who is getting into leather working, too, so that was fun.

Another group of classes I'm super excited about is OMG I GET TO LEARN FROM MICHELLE L'AMOUR!!!!

For those of you not familiar with who she is, you may have seen her viral performance of Beethoven's 5th with her butt:

<lj-cut text=""NSFW kind of goes without saying for most all of burlesque performances, but there you go, you&#39;ve been warned.""><lj-embed id=""23""/></lj-cut>

But really, my favorite of her performances is her Whole Lotta L'Amour and only partially because I love Led Zeppelin:

<lj-cut text=""You guessed it, NSFW.""><lj-embed id=""24""/> <p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/59812718"">""Whole Lotta L'amour"" featuring Michelle L'amour</a> from <a href=""http://vimeo.com/frankyvivid"">franky vivid</a> on <a href=""https://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</a>.</p></lj-cut>

So yeah, she's going to be here in town teaching a full Saturday of three different workshops in March and this little aspiring showgirl signed up for all three. I am beyond excited. I mean, it could only be better if it were Dita Von Teese, as far as I'm concerned.

Chris is, understandably, fully supportive of me in all this."

"event","Whatever I have done over the past year, whatever blocks I removed, whatever I have accomplished internally is now manifesting on the outside as true, unbridled momentum toward making all my dreams come true. But I also recognize and respect where I am on that continuum. 

I just had this little inkling about where I'd like to take my jewelry work, what skills I want to learn and perfect (pertaining to metalsmithing, mostly, but I also caught myself watching a lot of glass cutting tutorials on YouTube yesterday). I looked at what I'm doing right this minute and realized it is all a stepping stone to that eventuality. That if I continue pushing toward that ever distant horizon, there's really no limit to what I can learn and accomplish with this. That I should never grow impatient with my wire work because I can see how it will integrate into soldering and hammering my way to my ultimate goals. It's a fully formed place in itself. A place where a lot of people stop and grow quite comfortable and do amazing things. A place that has its own landscape and cast of characters and indeed and entire universe I could explore if I took the time to truly appreciate it, instead of treating it like flyover country.

I am a self-taught apprentice right now, cutting my teeth on learning the properties of the metals I'm working with and what their capable of through cold connections, long before a torch is ever lit. I'm getting to know metal, it's advantages and limitations. I'm becoming BFFs with copper and silver. Because it's only when we understand one another that we can begin to push against our boundaries, together, as artist and medium.

In a way, I feel like this study is long overdue. Like I jumped in before I really understood what it was I was doing. I wrapped a lot of cabochons before I knew what I was doing there and I haven't another wrapped a cabochon in probably two years or more (though I have a bulging drawer full of them begging me to diminish their stores, mostly so I can buy more). I'm not sure what's been nagging at me saying that I wasn't ready to tackle their numbers, but I think I'm ready to shred it now.

I grew a bit distracted in the quest to find some hook that would draw attention to my work. I lost the creation for the sake of creating drive and picked up the mantle of needing to sell some stuff to justify the work. Don't get me wrong, in the course of that distraction, I've stumbled upon some ideas that are unique and beautiful and make me proud every single day. And I will continue making those for the shear gratification of hearing ""what a great idea! These are beautiful!"" compliments from people passing by my table at a show. I got acquainted with some techniques and materials I never would have explored otherwise and I love the universes those have opened up for me as well. But I always come back to the metal and the gemstones.

Last weekend, in the last hour of the show, I had three different people approach my table and help reconnect me with what it was that drew me into jewelry work in the first place. It was the love of gemstones. The more raw, the better. One guy showed me a bunch of tumbled stones he had just purchased in the Frist gift shop and asked me how he should go about making them into wearable art. I remember looking at my tumbled rock collections when I first got a spool of craft wire to experiment with and trying out all sorts of sloppy cage techniques that would patina into a dull grey the first time I wore them in the shower. Another guy picked up the tourmaline and copper bracelet that inspired <a href=""http://blog.gaiasjewel.com/2013/09/fear-and-failure-parable.html"">that Fear and Failure parable post</a> I made a while back. He said I should be asking twice as much for it and complimented <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/20686334/sterling-silver-wire-wrapped"">my fluorapatite pendant</a>, which was one of my first Sterling silver wraps. He made the comment, ""I really love the raw stuff."" Me too, man. Me too.

It's all about balance, I suppose. I can't do the raw stuff all the time because that limits my audience. Some people really love the uniformly predictable bling of a Swarovski crystal. Some people really love the butterfly pendants or the slightly steampunk edge of my Golden Snitch lockets. And those pieces don't detract from the more natural stuff that inspired me to get into this thing in the first place. But I do need to remember to come back to that raw stuff. I need to make my fast moving lines of lamp pulls and dead bugs set in resin and such. Then, I need to set aside time to just browse through that drawer full of gems and take some time to frame their raw, natural beauty in some metal.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with how things are progressing. The show last weekend went really well. I made back my booth fee, which sounds like breaking even, but it was so much more to me. It was a pricey show to participate in, first of all. Secondly, I got approached by a lady who owns a gallery downtown who does an art crawl once a month and said she's always looking for unique jewelry. Several people took cards. One lady who bought a butterfly pendant wants me to email her any time I'm going to be at a show. Several people asked if I was in any local galleries or boutiques, some going so far as to suggest I pursue that. I felt myself come alive at the reception I got. It's extremely validating to chain yourself to your jewelry bench for a month creating and then have so many people appreciate your work so vocally and enthusiastically.

It's like a perpetual motion machine of inspiration. I was sitting (or standing for about 95% of the day because I need a taller chair to be accessible to people browsing) between times when there were visitors to my table, messaging with Brandy about how to improve my displays. We were brainstorming things like miniature quidditch brooms to hang the snitches on and a shadowbox type display that looks like a specimen collection for the butterflies and bugs. The more I'm inspired and the more I bring those inspirations to life, the more I'm inspired to do even more. So, yesterday, I placed orders to get those new displays underway and increase my inventory even more and today I applied for my next show in April. Maybe next week, I'll take a tour of local boutiques to see which ones I think might be a good fit for my work and start talking to people about wholesale.

Good things, you guys. All good things."

"event","I feel like the space between moments grows smaller and smaller and my task list and catalog of commitments only seems to grow larger. I'm busy getting ready for a craft show three weeks from tomorrow. Chris has been amazing, taking up so much of the housework that he practically only leaves me with the task to create. But I have other obligations as well. I need to create a place to log all of those so I don't find myself so overcommitted. Things are slipping through the cracks. And I need to carve out time to just create space. Just space, with no purpose.

I was recently given back two necklaces that I gave to people as gifts. Those two people are now deceased (my grandmother and my stepmother). I'm wrestling with what to do with them. I have plenty of sentimental things to remember them by. I will never wear either piece as they were tailor made for the person for whom they were intended and they're just not me at all. And I'd feel a little odd wearing them anyway. To sell them seems somehow... wrong, but I keep turning to that option. To poach them for materials seems off, too.

And again, I'm reminded of these things we leave behind. These physical legacies that have to be sorted through and wrestled with by your loved ones when you're gone. At some point, you have to just keep the most meaningful artifacts and treat the rest as a decluttering project. And that's really hard to do. I remember doing it with my mom's crafting room. It's what keeps me from being a pack rat to this day. But to be the one doing the clearing is a position weighted with guilt and second guessing. I'm reminded of the crumbling headstones up in the woods near our house. Who knows how many decades they've sat there forgotten. Who was the last one tasked with their upkeep, I wonder."

"event","There was a good turnout last night. I expect a very good turnout next week, as well. The five of us shared a moment in space and time where we collectively called out our demons and allowed them to be swallowed by the Earth and then called in healing and cleansing energies to scrub clean the gunk on our souls. Struggles were shared. Perspectives were broadened. The energy around us was thick and palpable. Everyone brought something to the table. The surrounding discussion was stimulating. Discord was never judgmental. All were heard openly and honestly. It was a utopia for but a brief few of hours on a Monday night in Johnny's living room. It was the dream he's been striving for years and I've been encouraging for months coming to fruition. And it was beautiful.

I shared in his excitement. I see each person that was present as a gift that keeps on giving through revelatory reflections on what we shared which continue to surface throughout my day and on into the coming week, I'm sure. And occasionally, I just burst into random giddy laughter because it's just so freaking beautiful! I have felt absolutely elated ever since I left last night. I would wake in the middle of the night and feel a stupid grin spread across my face. This morning, I even saw a goofy grin on the face of a rattlesnake in my dream just before I woke.

And about that dream... I was in a meadow, with woods nearby. Rattlesnakes kept coming out of the undergrowth in the woods to try to approach me. I heard a voice say ""Eastern Timber Rattlers"". I think I was protecting a child, maybe it was Jonah, I'm not sure. The snakes were the wrong colors, all bright orange and lime green and neon yellow, like a gradient across the length of their bodies. They would slither up to our feet, hiss and rattle and I'd kick at them and they'd retreat. This happened three times with three snakes approaching each time, but only one of them in my field of vision when I kicked at them. On the third time, only one came out at us and when I kicked at it, it did not retreat, but tried to lunge and bite again. I grabbed it by the head and swung it around to wring its neck, killing it. A moment's pause to see no more snakes were coming, and then I woke up.

All the time, they had these big grins on their faces, which I thought was odd, even while in the dream. Also, there was never a feeling of fear in me. There was a sense of being protective, but I don't remember feeling afraid that the snakes were coming. There was sort of a moment of bracing myself to defend against attack, but not innate fear of the snakes. There's this nagging thought that I was tolerant of the attacks as long as I could fend them off relatively effortlessly. But once an attack became persistent, I killed the attacking snake. I think that's significant, given what I've learned about conflict recently through the meditations.

Also, I don't know if it's because I've meditated with him so many times now or if it's just an intuitive connection we both tap into or something, but I found myself anticipating Johnny's imageries or his shifts in focus between various centers. I also felt energetic entities suiting me up in armor during the meditation. Whatever any of it means, it's significant to say that I haven't felt a depressive cycle in many weeks. I wouldn't recognize the me I was then if I ran into her on the street now. I'd have to ask someone who knew her what she was like."

"event","I'm working on this bracelet design today that incorporates chips of tourmaline and copper wire into chain links. I'm making each link and threading them together as I'm wrapping them, not with jumprings. My thought is that the structural integrity of such a design would be superior to one that might be slightly easier to put together (i.e. one using jumprings or eyepins to join the links). It's a bit tricky in the fabrication, but I feel like that will be rewarded with the longevity of the piece. Not to mention that it just looks cooler with all those copper coils framing each chip of tourmaline.

Perhaps inevitably, with 13 links and 12 dangling ""charms"" made similarly (custom headpins with beads that are threaded into the links of the bracelet rather than being attached by jumprings), something was bound to go wrong along the way. Either a work hardened wire would snap at an inopportune moment or a bead would shatter or something. Well, one of those things went wrong about halfway through the links. As I was cutting the coil around one bead, with the next link already attached, my wire cutters slipped and I shattered a bead. There was no unwinding the wire to string a new bead on and try again. I had to cut that link off, scrap that wire and figure out what to do next as I stared at this piece of beaded chain with two ends of closed loops.

My ""oh shit"" moment was just that, a moment, and then I cut a fresh piece of wire and made a fresh loop to hook into one end and get the links going again. But during that ""oh shit"" moment, I thought all was lost. I thought of the hour I spent last night making the beginnings of these links and the cost of the wire wasted and tried to think how else I could salvage it or if I could just attach some chain and make it just sort of half beaded bracelet or something. But I was in the throes of despair for a moment. It was only a moment, but the despair was very real and very heavy, even crushing. But as I opened myself to the solution, it seemed so very obvious and probably would have come to me instantly had I not taken that moment to despair. 

Then, I had a bit of an epiphany moment. I realized that most moments of despair are just like this one was: unnecessary obstacles in the path of success. And I started to think about fear as a particular brand of despair. Fear is often irrational, based on some hypothetical situation that may or may not come to fruition. Fearing something, even something that may likely happen doesn't help you to overcome that situation when it actually presents itself. Fear can sometimes save your life. It's an evolutionary response for a reason. But there's an evolutionary step that's often missing, to push past the fear into the solution.

Fear of failure, and the even more irrational fear of success, have been obstacles in my path for far too long. They've kept me stagnant when I should have been active. Kept me distracted when I should have been focused. With this minor hiccup which caused such intense, momentary panic behind me, I was able to see that I sort of manifested this little challenge to help me practice setting aside my fear-based despair in order to find a solution to a problem that presented itself. And as soon as I start looking at things as challenges instead of seeing them as yet another thing that's going to knock me down or hold me back, the solutions materialize just as instantly as the problem and the subsequent despair did. 

As soon as I start seeing failures as the little things they actually are instead of the huge monsters I've made them out to be, I can conquer anything that comes my way.

And that's my little nugget of wisdom from the jewelry bench today."

"event","I just want to take this moment to say that I've scored one of only 35 booths at Jonah's school fair at the end of September and I'm wickedly happy about that. I'm wickedly happy because last year, a kind of snooty lady gave me a sort of flippant response when I tried to sign up. She asked what I did and I said that I made jewelry and she said, in this dismissive tone as she crinkled her nose as though she smelled something foul, ""oh, well, you can fill this out, but we already have a lot of jewelry."" I had already talked to a lady who was on the PTO because she happened to be the personal trainer I saw at the Y for an evaluation and she had told me it seemed like it was kind of who you knew, whether you'd get called.

This year, it's a different lady handling it and it was first come, first served. I had emailed her right away yesterday, since the info came in on Friday of who to contact. So she was already aware of me and what I did when I went in this morning first thing to sign up. I got the confirmation this afternoon that we're in. And by we, I mean, I'm sharing a table with Johnny so he can sell his herbal tea blends and maybe some meditation CDs. I think our wares will blend pretty nicely.

There's another one I'm going to apply for at the end of October out at the Wilson County Fairgrounds. It looks like a huge event and now that we have a pop-up canopy, I can go for a 12x12 outdoor spot. And I plan to split that with Johnny, too. That one I'd like to kind of set up like a total bazaar. I've got a <a href=""http://fromthesol.etsy.com"">newfound local friend who makes clothes</a> who could maybe come in and fill out the space with yet another facet, if she's interested. People would feel like they're browsing a real deal boutique. But first things first...

At the school fair, I'll be debuting my costuming venture: Mel's Belles Costumes. I'm still working on getting domains and things set up for that so that I can put out a couple of examples with a small banner and a stack of business cards for people to contact me for their kids' Halloween costume needs. I figure if I don't feel like I can handle the scope of what they want or won't have time, I can turn down the job. But if I put it out there so people know there's someone in the area who dabbles in this stuff, I can pick up some extra work as I'm able. I plan to have all our family costumes done before Oct. 1st, since we're headed to Disney on the 7th and will be wearing them to Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party on the 10th. That leaves all of October for me to take on little things, like what I'm doing for mine and Jonah's costumes (which is to buy a store bought base and make it awesome with handmade accessories and details). I did that Katniss Arena costume last year for my neighbor with minimal work, as well. I can do stuff like this on commission. I can even use our finished costumes as display examples at the booth. The October one will obviously be too late, but I might just take cards anytime I'm doing a jewelry show, just to put a bug in people's ears for next year. I don't think there's a huge market, but there might be enough to keep me busy and you just never know. At this point, I want to monetize on any of my marketable skills. Repeat after me: I will not work a desk job. I will not work a desk job. I will not work a desk job.

By the way, this officially marks the death of Silver Screen Accessories, not that anyone would notice as I never really did anything with that anyway. I don't feel like that name ever really conveyed what I wanted to do with it. That might explain a little of the neglect (but for my jewelry business, which does exactly convey what I want and is yet still often neglected). My domain for SSA expired today and I'm just letting it die. I've already decommissioned all the email addresses and social networking accounts associated with it (I think). So, in its place will rise Mel's Belles. I like it. It's got that ""sweet girl... but damn"" appeal. Or at least with the proper treatment it will. I just registered the domains, but they don't even point to anything yet. I've got <a href=""http://melsbellescostumes.blogspot.com"">a blog up with one entry</a> and a Google+ profile and <a href=""https://twitter.com/melsbellescos"">a Twitter account</a>, but I still have a lot of work to do to establish something useful/informational and at the same time, I need to re-evaluate and perhaps update the Gaia's Jewel stuff, too.

But before I do anything, I'm going to make those earrings I keep promising Doug and Abby and forgetting about!

Lots to do. And that feels really good."

<lj-cut text=""Let me tell you about ALL THE THINGS!"">I will be carving out time this evening to pull all the Colorado photos off our collective devices and get them all in a central location so I can share them. There narrative of that trip is spread out over the two of our phones and our camera. In short, the trip was everything I wished it would be and so much more. I got to see three friends (Yvette, Michelle, and my friend Holly in New Mexico whom I hadn't seen in about 8 years and I finally got to meet her kids and that was just fabulous). 

We summited the tallest peak in Colorado. Which is sort of misleading to say, since it's class 1 trails all the way to the top. One of the easiest of the 14ers to conquer. But for someone who is used to climbing peaks in the 6,000 foot range, it was a challenging accomplishment and felt akin to running my first half marathon. Also, when we hit the first snow field and the last cairn we could see, it appeared all the other footprints went straight up, while indeed the trail zigged to the left to begin switchbacks to the summit. So, for the last half mile or so, we climbed straight up the side of the mountain over 4 or 5 other snow fields when we should have only had to cross that first one. Oh well. We made it without incident and found the trail again on our way down.

We spent three days amongst marmots and mountain goats in Weminuche Wilderness. The train was quite the experience. On the way out, we got put on a car that was full of a senior citizen tour group. When the train stopped before reaching Silverton and we hopped off and they noticed the brakemen tossing backpacks out of the freight car directly in front of us, they seemed a little alarmed that the train was leaving people in the middle of nowhere at first. But then, as more people joined us and they noticed this was a typical thing, they waved at us through the windows and told us to have fun as we strapped on our packs and crossed the foot bridge over the Animas River into Weminuche. The goats were... interesting companions. Always following us around waiting for us to pee on something so they could get some salt. There was one point as we hiked down from Twin Lakes where a mama and baby were following close behind me and I turned to snap a picture of them and mama hopped off the rock they were perched on, eyeing me as though I was a human shaped salt lick. Had I not moved on, she might have come right up and started nibbling the exposed skin on my arms. But we're supposed to respect their wild nature and not allow them to approach us so I shooed her away and kept on going. The marmots made me laugh every time I saw them. Seriously, these things are hilarious! And we ate better in the wilderness than we ever have before. All of our dehydrated efforts well worth it!

We stayed in the hotel equivalent to Soul Plane in Albuquerque which was kind of hilarious. I used the phrase, ""polished turd"" several times in describing the place. Holly and her family stayed there too and we had a good laugh about it over breakfast.

We ate green chili smothered everything.

And we spent 17 hours in the car driving back from New Mexico all in one go which was ridiculously stupid and dangerous and not something I will allow to happen again. Chris did all the driving. I kept offering, but he kept saying he was fine. Until after Memphis. And then we sort of started to fall apart. But we made it and literally fell into bed once we got in.

And then a month later, I went to New Orleans for Alqualonde 2013. I make that designation now because it seems like there's demand for us to do this again. I'm in agreement. It was ridiculously fun. There were six of us. A great group that was totally able to get along and everyone seemed able to do their own thing for the most part. Plus, we closed down Bourbon Street one night, which I didn't think was a thing that happened. Especially not at 3am. But there were elvish pool parties and drinking and plantation tours with velvety voiced bus drivers who entranced us and drinking and Anne Rice's old house in the Garden District and drinking and elvish shenanigans on camera in Louis Armstrong Park and drinking and a riverboat cruise with a jazz brunch and drinking and eating all the things. It was marvelous and I can't wait to share those pics, too.

And somewhere in there, I reconnected with my friend Johnny. It's a short but complicated story about how we both sort of conceded this as a test of our friendship and decided to look at it as water under the bridge and move forward with lessons learned on both sides. It was really rocky at first and I was the one to come forth first to apologize for my wrongs done in the interest of throwing barbs at him from the pit of my pain. But we've worked past terse messages exchanged and superficial online chatter back into serious exploratory conversation and co-meditation. We're both spurring one another on into our respective intended paths as far as our life purposes. He's working on getting his business and contractor licenses and liability insurance and such to make his dreams of being a handyman/meditation facilitator/herbalist a reality and I'm working on heading that direction myself and carving out my own legacy of being a writer/costumer/jewelry maker. He's pushing me to write and publish. He recognizes that's a huge outlet for my soul purpose. This week, we finally had our first conversation that felt like the ones we had before our meltdown. When we parted ways, we both felt like we'd just finished a therapy session. I've missed that. So much good stuff gets dredged and begins healing in those conversations. Well, actually it's usually really awful stuff that's getting dredged, it's just that it's good it's getting dredged.

And that's been my summer pretty much. Jonah is back in school and excited about being a first grader. And I'm in this deep breath of ""now what?"" as I try to organize my thoughts and start moving in productive directions during the day while I don't have anyone around to care for. 

I'm not going to Dragon*Con, though I wanted to start costuming as if I was. I have finally found my roll of fabric for Celeborn (oh, right, I finished my mockup and was all set to cut it out and finally get this costume done for Alqualonde and I couldn't find my fabric anywhere). But now, after a plane ride home which broke off most of the fragile little points and appears to have done something akin to tarnishing the paint somehow, my collar needs to be remade. I'm thinking of getting some Worbla to try on v2.0 and the belt buckle thingy. I've always wanted to shift the design a tiny bit anyway. The perfectionist in me has always been dissatisfied with the way I drew out the original design in that I did it too wide and the angle wasn't quite right. Skipping the gluing step by using Worbla seems very appealing to me right now. But I know it's a hell of a lot more expensive than Sintra.

Oh, and we're going to Disney Oct. 7th-11th. So there are costumes for Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party to contemplate as well. Then there's GMX at the end of October, so there's that. I've got enough half finished projects that I made a list of all of those and will just work through finishing them before starting anything new.</lj-cut>"

"event","We leave on Thursday on our first trip out West since 2005. I've gotten over my trip anxiety by immersing myself in reading and research and planning and stuff. It's been oddly romantic, the two of us on the couch every night with our laptops open, sharing links and building our trip itinerary and checklists on shared notebooks on Evernote. We make a good team. And I was thinking about these sorts of trips, and how we have to work together to get everything done and planned and we both have to have input into the destinations so that no one is overcommitted to something they can't really handle (Arapaho Glacier hike that had me in tears by the summit last time, anyone? I'm kinda sad I'm not going to get a rematch on that one now that I'm in better shape, actually).

Plus, I'm going to get to see at least three friends in three different states. Yay for covering lots of ground! The trip should be a nice balance between enjoying the various cities in our path and time in the wilderness. But we will almost always be in motion.

The thing that has me the most nervous is the section where we're taking a historic steam train out into Weminuche Wilderness from Durango. We'll hike in an additional six miles from where the train drops us off in Needleton. If something happened and we needed to get back, it would be an 11 mile hike back to civilization or hoping we catch the train on it's daily trip through (the train saves you the first five miles in). But, now that I realize Chris isn't going to try to do any strenuous hikes there, I'm feeling a bit more at ease about that.

Other than that, there's been the exciting prospect of really flexing our cooking muscles to create meals we can dehydrate and pack in. In addition to our standard jerky and fruit leathers, we made a huge crockpot of veggie chili and dehydrated it, then portioned it up in single serving vacuum sealed bags. Then I browned and seasoned some ground turkey and threw a couple of cans of green chiles in a couple of cans of chipotle seasoned refried beans and separately dehydrated those to make backpacking burritos. The weight and ""just add water"" and (hopefully) reduced cooking times and single pot limitations to backpacking meals pose interesting challenges to work around. We haven't prepped like this for a camping trip in years. Our dehydrator seems like it's been running nonstop for four days. We've come so far from the canned chicken in a pot of Stove Top stuffing days. And I remember how divine that would taste after a day on the trails, so just imagine what a truly home cooked meal will be like!"

"event","This is my next challenge. I thought at first I was shifting to a more extroverted phase, but really, I'm an introvert who's realizing the value of interactions and forcing myself out there into vulnerability land. There's this pull in me to recognize the importance of an ""it takes a village"" sort of mentality.

I'm getting involved in Nashville Urban Food Forests (NUFF) where homeowners volunteer their yards to be planted with edibles by an all volunteer work crew who design and install it and I guess donate the money for the plants and such. I know they got a truckload of mulch donated on the last dig-in. I haven't gone to an event yet and the next one falls when I'm out of town, so maybe I'll be able to get out in May. By then my own gardens should be in maintenance mode. Plus, my friend Johnny wants me to help him start sort of a home garden co-op. Where everyone involved has a couple of plots and everyone grows something a little different and shares the crops of each site. Everyone works together to install and plant the plots, but then it's up to each site owner to be the caretaker and harvester and distributor. Basically, he's counting on my experience in square foot gardening and landscaping with herbs and fruit and how to construct raised beds and such. Designer, planner, teacher... all sorts of interactions with other people. I think he's doing this just to put me in this position and make me deal with it.

So there's that. Then there's the jewelry business and getting more serious about making that happen. I was contacted by a guy via email the other day saying he saw my site and liked the attention to detail I put into my custom pieces. He asked if I'd like to join as a maker on <a href=""http://custommade.com"">CustomMade.com</a>, a website where buyers go to bid for an artisan to design and make them a custom piece of furniture or jewelry. Serendipity, my friends. I had just been working out that I needed to find an outlet to get my fix for commissions. I love commissions and no one goes to Etsy for commissions, in my experience. The sort of shoppers I attract are people who want something ready made, but unique and that's fine. But commissions are where I really flourish. If I could do this alongside putting the ready-made lines of things on Etsy and at art and craft shows and maybe a boutique or two locally as my bread and butter, this could work. But yes, interactions galore. Rejection potential high. Failure potential high. Persistence and communication of utmost importance.

And I have other things in the pipeline that will require to make connections with people and put myself out there and take risks on getting hurt. Which is why all this inner work is so important right now. I have to get that cleared up and learn new patterns for coping so that I'm not totally halted when I hit a setback.

I leave you with a wise and important message delivered by Ben Folds Five and Fraggles:

""Certainty of death, small chance of success... What are we waiting for?"" - Gimli

No really, I was just spouting off yesterday somewhere about how I need to stop fearing things that aren't going to kill me. Pain isn't death. Failure isn't death. Letting fear make me stop living life might as well be death."

"event","So, as I've been doing all this work on my own ego, I'm really sensitive to ego lately. And in the craft beer community, there's so much ego it's palpable. After the East Nashville Brew Fest a few weeks ago, he jumped on the community to write what sounded like a yelp review of the festival on a facebook group run by the guy who operates the festival. That's all well and good. Constructive feedback is helpful. But he directly attacked a couple of brewers, by name, not just ""so and so Brewery"" but ""John Doe Brewer"" for not bringing beers that you can't get at their taprooms locally. And that he expected more for what he paid for his ticket. Because apparently like 300 something beers weren't enough for him to try.

So, even giving him the benefit of the doubt, one of the brewers he called out brought three beers that are small, one-off batches that he released that week for the lead up to the festival. The other one did bring a couple of festival specific casks, but he complained that they had brought four or five last year.

He got dog piled. Seriously, all night after the festival and the next morning at the fancy beer brunch we went to with a couple of friends of ours (which was amazing!!, but I had five 8-10oz beers by noon on a Sunday) we just watched this thread grow with people calling him out and him trying to defend himself and then someone would agree with him and just drama, drama, drama and it was hilarious. The brewers he called out are all on there, so, that was fun. 

Somewhere around 60 comments into the thread, I piped up with, ""I for one was disappointed by the pickle offerings this year. The pickle vendors just didn't really bring it. Not a single Brussels sprout aged in a balsamic vinegar barrel. But seriously, can we just all recognize that life is not a fucking yelp review and get back to bragging about the beers that you're not drinking?""

And with that, I successfully derailed the conversation into jokes about pickles. An hour later, the owner of the craft beer group and organizer of the festival created a Nashville Pickle Aficionados group on Facebook. Except he misspelled aficionados... just like he did when he created the beer group. So now it's called the Nashville Pickle Appreciators. And it started as a parody of the beer group. People taking pics of the random jars of pickled things they had in their fridge, relish in beer tasting glasses, etcetera. And the group grew to about 80 people over the span of 48 hours, which is about a third of the size of the beer group. It was like layers and layers of irony. But with a bunch of beer lovers, it's only a matter of time until the fermentation nerds start coming out of the woodwork and there were homemade jars of kimchi and all sorts of other various things. And now, almost two weeks later, it's become kind of a legitimate thing. Which is almost funnier than the joke. They quoted my original comment in the group description. But it is so not even close to what it started as. It's been passed amongst about 50 people and transformed into something totally different. And now legitimate pickle enthusiasts are going to find it and I just can't stop laughing.

The guy who originally complained hasn't been seen around the group since. I wasn't trying to accomplish that, but damn... some self-awareness, some perspective, see what an entitled douchebag you sound like and maybe look at this a little differently. Chill out and drink a damn beer!

I'm getting better at it. I'm able to create an inhospitable environment so that emotional downturns can't really take root, though I still weather a little bit of their effects. I know how to recharge. I just have to make myself do it regularly and catch the invasions when they're happening, before they take hold. It's like when you feel yourself starting to get sick, so you double up on your vitamins and water intake and get some extra rest to keep from getting full blown sick. But you have to respect that your immune system still takes a blow and keep it up. I could see depression as being kind of an emotional immune deficiency. I've made a commitment to myself to stay emotionally healthy.

Which leads me to wanting another tattoo. Which reminds me that I never posted about my last one. I just went back and checked. I posted it to Twitter/Facebook, but not here, I guess. It's kind of funny now how it's changed from what I thought it was about. It says mahtar, which is the Quenya word for warrior, which is funny because I chose a Sindarin Tengwar mode to write it in. This is not something I realized at the time, but I think it's oddly fitting and I intend to carry the theme of that with healer (or renewer, which is the closest I could find, which it turns out is one of Aragorn's nicknames, Envinyatar) on the left wrist to match. This one is on the right wrist. I had it done with a Groupon, which still amuses me.

The artist used to go to a lot of convensions and do ink for people. She's a big comic book and anime geek, but is stuck doing a lot of cover ups for hood tattoos. She was excited to do something geeky and I was her first Tolkien tattoo. I'd go back to her for the second one. She did a good job.

So as I was saying, it's come to mean many things for me. For one, it makes me keep fighting when I'm having trouble finding my will. For another it reminds me that everyone is fighting their own battles and to meet others with compassion. And depending on the day, it has any number of other meanings, which I guess is the mark of a good tattoo. What I think healer will mean will be my capacity to help others by sharing my experiences (the memoir) and also it will be a beacon to draw people to me that will help me to heal and not cause more hurts. And probably a hundred other things I'll think of as they become relevant.

They're addictive you guys.

So there's lots of other new stuff going on with gardening on a communal level and jewelry and writing and art and I'm slowly trickling my way into the artistic community in Nashville which is something I didn't even realize I was thirsty for until I started peering into the windows of that party. It's spring you guys! I know it was sleeting yesterday, but it's freaking spring!"

"event","Wow, it's been a while since I've visited that space. Too long. It's mid-CostumingJuly! Need to get to work. Wait... according to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/1585425524"">The Now Habit</a>, that's negative self-talk and instead I <i>choose</i> to get to work. I'd love to get to work! I'd love to pull out my sewing machine right fucking now and whip up something gorgeous. But there's other work to be done first and my office/workroom/guestroom is still a mess with paper clutter I'm trying to sort through and file or get rid of. I hate paper, you guys. I just really, really do.

And then there's also the matter that I need to fix my dress form. The little plastic piece on the pole it stands on that lets you adjust the height cracked a long time ago and I've been ""fixing"" it periodically by wrapping it to the pole with electrical tape to try to keep it together. But slowly over time, that would start to slide down the pole with pressure and gravity and before long, my dress form was about 6"" too short. So, I went to Home Depot to look for pvc pipe fittings (because that's what this thing looks like) that would work and I found a few things that are perfect in shape but the wrong size, so I need to go back and exchange the ones I have for something that fits. I think I'm looking for a 3/4"" to 1/2"" reduction fitting with no threads. Then I have to drill some holes in the sides for the thumbscrews which tighten it to the pole. And aside from that, I know, just know, that with all this weight loss, my dress form needs to be taken in. That's a whole project in itself. I don't relish fighting with that cover again, but I need to if I want anything I make to fit.

So anyway, January 9th was the last time I talked about these projects and goals here. I had ordered some trims and stuff from eBay that I never got around to posting about when they came in. You should have seen how giddy I was to receive all that stuff and pin things to the dress form and think about the possibilities.

<lj-cut text=""And the list grows on..."">One of the pieces was this amazingly gorgeous kind of silvery-greyish-green chunk of a sari or dupatta or something, I'm assuming. It's heavily beaded and has all these leaves and flowers and faux pearls on it. It's cut in kind of a wedge, with a decorative hem and is just screaming center front panel of a skirt or something. I pinned it on under my Angel overgown and fell in love with everything but the bright green organza flowers, which I've since removed and plan to replace with some silver bullion applique flowers instead. Here's what it looks like:

It's kind of a combination of that silver shot silk overcoat/dress thing she wears in The Hobbit, but with a higher neckline with trim, and split in front to show an undergown with the above panel prominently displayed, and shorter split sleeves made of the second piece I got which is this dreamy pale grey silk jacquard with embroidered and beaded leaves on it:

Some of them have brown beads and some have clear silver lined ones. There doesn't seem to be a pattern to that. There are some stains on it though and I'm going to have to try to gently wash it before I use it. The leaves are in rows which when hung on the bias looks neat. And I intend to cut the rectangle in half diagonally, so bias it will be. I did that with a piece of velvet on a wrap shirt I never finished and it worked beautifully for some flowy, split open sleeves. I should pull that piece out and try to fix the fitting problems with it because it's a gorgeous shirt. It was before I knew not to just extend the hem line of something in order to lengthen it, so it's kind of weird at the hem and doesn't fit right. But I digress. I'll have to play with the sleeves a bit to see what will work in real life before I settle on a shape. It may be that I find something to do a two part sleeve, like most of Arwen's gowns (that's what I did with the wrap shirt). Or I might even make the overgown sleeveless or something and have these on the undergown. Or maybe stick with the design in the movies and have big split sleeves on the overgown and have these peaking through or something. Ah, the beauty of original designs and endless possibilities.

The one thing I'll make exactly like the movies is the brooch. I've already got the mother of pearl disc. I've had it for like a decade. But now, I'm armed with Sintra! So I can make it super lightweight. And I think the Hobbit version of her circlet would look good with this too. Might pick up that nice, cheap costume version and see about altering it a bit or something. And I'll probably buy a replica Nenya ring.

I'm thinking I'll add this to the list to start on after Dragon*Con to have ready for the premiere of the second Hobbit movie. I really should revisit my list because some things are coming off of it, I know. And I've got a few options on the Angel gown trim I need to photograph and consider and finish that thing up, too.</lj-cut>

"event","So, I've done exactly two days of P90X since my last posting about it and that was that first week back when I ""recommitted"" myself. I only feel mildly guilty about that. I could talk about cramping. And I could talk about getting a cold and being sick for a few days. And I could talk about practically leaping onto a rock with all my weight on the ball of my bare right foot when I ran out to the mailbox one day and the horrendous stone bruise that resulted, which I'm still not convinced isn't a little bit of a fracture. Three weeks later and I still have some residual soreness if I step just wrong.

But, somehow, I'm still losing weight. At first, it was coming off a couple of pounds a week because I stopped building muscle, but my eating habits also changed to reflect that I wasn't burning an extra 500-1000 calories a day. But then I gained back a little bit and saw 205 again. But then, I started doing all this meditation work and I found that when I would practice during the day, I wasn't hungry. I felt full, in fact. I needed lots of water, but I wasn't hungry at all. I'd go all day having a protein bar and a cup of coffee for breakfast and then not eat anything until about 3pm when I suddenly would feel ravenous, but I could manage to eat something small, 200-300 calories or so, and be satiated. Then I'd eat dinner normally, but even then, my normal portion size often seemed like too much and I'd stop eating halfway through.

Maybe I mentioned before how I'd be excited to be below 200 pounds for the first time in... I can't really remember how long. I didn't make it a habit of weighing myself in high school and right after, so I honestly don't know and that's definitely when I was at my most fit. I know I've been losing a lot the past two weeks because my last three ribs or so are really sore. I figured out, it's because of how I slouch when I sit and the fat that was cushioning them before isn't there anymore. So they get squished into my abdomen when I round my back. Chris has mentioned several times how flat my stomach is these days.

So even though I wasn't ""working out"" I started weighing myself weekly again. Last week, I was down 4 pounds. Four pounds in a week. This week I'm down another four. Eight pounds in two weeks! That's too rapid to be really healthy weight loss, I realize. But damn it, it's hard not to be excited because I'M AT 197 BITCHES!!! I'm below 200 for the first time in what seems like forever and it feels freakin' awesome.

Today is Jonah's last day of school before two weeks of spring break. And I need to stop being a pussy and schedule my LEEP procedure (yes, I still haven't taken care of that). Both of those things are going to prevent me from picking back up on P90X right now. But I'm obviously doing something right and it's not like I live a sedentary life (I hiked 6+ miles last Saturday, for example) and I obviously know how to fuel myself to make sure I'm still burning off fat but not starving. So I'm not going to beat myself up about not deliberately working out. I'll pick it back up as soon as I can. But right now, I'm going to throw myself a little victory party. Chris said we should celebrate with bacon. That seems counterproductive to my efforts. Plus next week is Nashville Craft Beer Week and... yeah. So, I'm thinking a non-caloric celebration is in order."

"event","Instead of the novel I can no longer bring myself to write (and I've gotten affirmation from my Taoist friend through a hypothetical vision he had, perfectly describing a tragic death in my storyline, so I definitely can not continue pursuing that), I think I'm ready to start working on a series of personal essays that I hope to shape into a memoir. 

I used to think you had to be someone special to write a memoir like a celebrity or a politician or something significant. But I've read a lot of ""ordinary people"" memoirs in the past couple of years and they speak so beautifully to the human condition of struggle and triumph and the beautiful insanity that is life. And I think I can do that. 

Looking back, the very first book I chose to read for myself was Maya Angelou's <i>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</i> and it just spoke to me so loud and clear and I didn't realize it until the other day when I was looking for a totally unrelated book on the Nook app and saw it there in the bestseller list on the front page of the search screen. I remembered being so enthralled with her life. It was the first book I remember not being able to put down. It was the first book that made me cry. Staying up well past my bedtime with a flashlight under my blankets reading ""just one more paragraph"" which turned into ""just one more page"" which turned into ""just one more chapter"". As a 7th grader working on a biographical oral report assignment, she was who I chose and that was my introduction to truly riveting reading. Not reading that was forced on me which I resisted like a spoiled child, but a choice I made to pursue a book with a voracious appetite. And devour it, I did. Then when she became Poet Laureate soon after, I silently celebrated her as a fellow survivor of childhood sexual abuse and looked to her as a model to overcome it and reclaim my life from the jaws of trauma. And then my mom died a couple of years later and I lost that for a while. But I found it again. It took until my 30th year of life, but I found it. And it was through beginning a series of personal essays that helped me to find it. Anyway, that's for the memoir now, I guess.

I even have a working title: <i>Die a Thousand Deaths</i>. I think that's pretty descriptive of someone who's struggled off and on with depression and mourned a long list of actual deaths."

"event","So, you guys know how at the beginning of the year I was all re-inspired by my novel and ready to try to hammer out a first draft throughout this year. Well... it came to me yesterday that I'm kind of living a huge chunk of my plot out right now in the real world, minus the vampires.

What. The. Fuck?

It just hit me, this is my life. I can't write this as fiction. It'll seem totally contrived. I can't do it. So I'm letting it go. I'm letting it go forever. I may never pick this story back up again. I'm too close to it. Too close to even manipulate it into something different than it is right now. I mean, that was the whole set up. The whole relationship structure I was building my plot on top of is unfolding in front of my eyes right now in the real world and it's freaking me out.

How did that happen? Did I manifest this? Was it something in my subconscious coming out? I don't know. All I know is that this is weird and surreal and I guess now I should just focus on drawing all those Things Jonah Says comics and writing the Adventures with Max serials and continuing The Accidental Memoir instead. Nobody needs another vampire series anyway."

"event","Not a whole lot going on right now that's word worthy. But we went on a spontaneous hike at Collins Gulf on Saturday.

The weather was gorgeous and it was just good for all of us to get a little bit out of town and breathe fresh air and disconnect.  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/sets/72157632868116530/"">Here is the full set of pics.</a>

"event","Okay, yes, I kind of fell off the wagon on some things, but I've still been doing P90X mostly. I've missed a lot of workouts, but I'm still seeing progress and I'm ready to recommit. Chris complimented the definition of my ass the other day and I'm less than a pound away from breaking 200. So even if I haven't been consistent, I'm still doing something right. Things feel stronger and like they work better and I don't have some of the aches on tendons and ligaments like I was getting. Also my posture is better and my back is stronger and more flexible. All good things which could be even better if I'd recommit and workout 6 days a week like the first two weeks instead of 2 to 4 times a week like the second two weeks.

I love the yoga now and I think this is going to become just a regular weekly thing for me. Maybe not Saturdays, but I  might try to work it into a weekly running/strength training/yoga routine once I'm done with this. I still can't do everything, but I'm progressing and it feels really good. Just like wringing my entire body out. Perfect end to a week of hard work. Seriously. Namaste motherfuckers. If Tony Horton could do R-rated P90X, I'm sure that's what he'd say at the end. But I don't want to see Tony Horton do R-rated P90X.

Month one/phase one is over and I'm into phase two which is another four weeks. I think I'm supposed to do measurements and take pics again at this point, but I don't know how much progress there is to actually record yet. I missed a lot of workouts the past couple of weeks and the ones I did manage to do seemed like ""same song different verse, a little bit louder and a little bit worse."" I'm sure that's because I was skipping workouts, thereby making the ones I didn't skip harder. So I took minimal notes and there's not really a lot to say that I haven't already said. No new workouts, though there was a change in the order of them last week and no strength training. But I've got no new rep numbers, no changes in weights used. I skipped the one workout that had pullups, so I don't know how I'm progressing on those, though I do try to do one about once a day without a chair in a few different positions. Some are easier than others.

Then there's the fact that we got a new desk and rearranged the office which is awesome, but now there's all this stuff everywhere that was in the old desk that I have to reorganize and create spaces for. We went minimal and I plan to build a bunch of shelves in the closet and around the room, but I haven't done that yet. So, in the meantime, there's all this crap in the way that I have to move out of the room and then move back in when I'm done working out. You know, after I'm done exercising myself to the point of near muscle failure, I'm going to haul a bunch of storage drawers full of stuff back into the room. Maybe that could count as the warm up and cool down. I think I need to put ""build some damn shelves"" on my to do list for this week so I can't use that as an excuse not to workout."

"event","I have discovered the joys of shrimp stock. Finally, all that time spent shelling and tailing the little bastards has paid off. I made some Shrimp Creole a couple of weeks ago, making up the recipe as I went along. I mean, Cajun and Creole pretty much all follows the same formula: start with butter, sweat onions, bell peppers, celery and sometimes garlic, add flour and make a roux at some point probably, add either tomatoes or cream, tons of Tony's Creole seasoning. Apply to whatever meat or seafood and serve over rice.

I would post a pic, but both nights, we sat down and devoured it before taking a pic.

But we sort of inadvertently did that last weekend. My mother-in-law decided to drive up for a visit late Saturday afternoon. She's been remodeling her kitchen (in an older house, where there are bound to be problems) and now they're having to get all new pipes or something and they've found out their shower was about to fall through the floor or something, I don't know. It's complicated and stressful and she wanted to escape that headspace for a little while.

She arrived right about the time Chris was supposed to meet a bunch of friends for a tour of Turtle Anarchy Brewery in Franklin. We checked with her and she seemed not to mind spending some time with Jonah so that both of us could go. We raced through the Western Williamson County countryside, which is lovely and the roads we took sometimes followed the Old Natchez Trace, which has prehistoric origins. Two lane roads that seem like tunnels through huge hardwood trees with a historically registered dry stacked stone wall on one side and the Harpeth River on the other.

We got there just in time to get an extra ticket for the tour. They're a really small brewery. And when you've seen one brewery, you've pretty much seen them all. Unless they're doing something really different, like New Belgium's carbon neutral brewery or whatever it is they're doing. I think they generate all their own electricity or something. Knowing them, it's all powered by some dude on a bike hooked up to a giant generator. They're cycling enthusiasts. They have a bike themed traveling circus called Tour de Fat, which is a lot of fun if it ever comes to your city! But I digress.

Anyway, it was at least nice to ask the brewer a couple of questions about their plans to expand and new, experimental batches in the works. ""What's <i>that</i> oak barrel for?!"" When they're that small, they can do lots of fun stuff with little overhead. They've always got some pet project.

From there, we hung out and got a pint and then headed to another really great, really small brewery in Franklin, Cool Springs Brewery. They're probably the same size, but they've just recently acquired an offsite facility to start doing some sour stuff (so as not to infect the house brewery with the bacteria inadvertently. I mean, I wouldn't mind if all their beers had brett in them, but it's not for everyone).

We got a pint there but we couldn't wait around for food. We left and grabbed some of the most delicious burritos ever at Oscar's (or maybe we were starving, but they really were delicious burritos and every time I go there, I practically shout, WHY DON'T WE COME HERE MORE OFTEN!? p.s. - please open one in Bellevue. Yes, we have no <strike>bananas</strike> burritos.) We needed to get home because I had late night tickets to burlesque where both my former teachers were dancing. We had to change clothes, get a bed set up for my mother-in-law, get Jonah to bed and then get to Belmont in like an hour and a half.

It was very speak easy like, in the attic of Bongo Java on Belmont Blvd. (Fun fact: Betty Page went to college right around the corner at the Peabody campus of Vanderbilt.) Because they don't sell alcohol, it was an ""uncensored"" show (we have some weird laws). There were jokes about underboob all night and it was hilarious. Shan told me she loved seeing my hair down but realized why that would totally not work for class and I promised Freya I'd be back in classes soonish. She said, ""you better."" Maybe next semester I'll do 201 again. It's a little odd to hug your dance teacher while she's wearing nothing but pasties and a rhinestone merkin, but it goes with the territory, I guess.

We went home, way too tired from our workouts and running around drinking beer all night and totally forgot our late night tradition of stopping by Cafe Coco to get some junk food and coffee and laugh at hipsters until we were crawling into bed, exhausted.

As a ""thank you for being receptive to having our kid dumped off on you yesterday"", we took my mother-in-law out for breakfast at the Loveless Cafe which is right down the street from our house and kind of a tourist destination so we never go. On a Sunday morning, when everyone else is at church, you're seated immediately which makes it worth it. Chris and I both got their pulled pork barbecue with eggs served over corn cakes and hashbrown casserole, which is pretty much a mound of food. Jonah got enough pancakes and bacon for an adult, which is what they call a ""children's plate."" We each took roughly half our food home (and ate it for lunch) and were still completely stuffed. Martha headed home right after that.

Later that evening we heard our friends Jim and Joan from Huntsville were in town after a Midwestern States beer run. Seriously, they take beercations. That's a word I can support a little bit more. They had been at a new taproom and beer store on 8th called Craft Brewed and Chris barely caught them as they were leaving so he could pick up his ""order"" with them. See, they travel around and post to Facebook to see if anyone wants any regional/rare beers outside our distribution area. They pick them up, swing back through on their way home and you settle up your tab. It's kind of hilarious. Modern day bootlegging.

From there they were headed to Cool Springs Brewery. So we all went down there. Again. For the second time in one weekend. I got a different beer this time though and Derrick, the brewer there brought us out some ""not yet ready"" stuff (a coconut porter which was delicious and a brett saisson without the brett added yet) as well as some of the leftover, small batch of Scorpion King (a beer brewed with scorpion chiles, which are supposedly the hottest chile on earth, but I hear that all the time about so many different chiles, it's really hard to care anymore). It was hot. Definitely hotter than the Chilly Willy I had the night before (a jalapeno stout or porter or something, I don't remember). But it wasn't just tear inducingly hot like I was lead to believe it would be by one of our party. The homebrewed Hab Another (habanero beer) by Chris Brammon years ago was probably the hottest beer I've ever tried. You measure servings of that stuff in single digit milliliters. But whatever, it's not a pissing contest. That comes later.

Determined not to dine out for yet another freaking meal that weekend (this is seriously abnormal for us), we skipped ordering dinner and went home to make cheddar cheese waffles with fried chicken, drizzled with homemade barbecue sauce and sriracha, topped with dill pickles and jalapenos. Finally got my freakin' waffles! With style.

For all the dining out and bar drinking (hello, happy hour specials and meals that feed us twice and free childcare!), brewery touring (groupon, 50% off) and burlesque seeing (tickets were only $12), we honestly didn't spend much all weekend. So hurray for staycations! But I still freakin' hate that word.</lj-cut>"

"event","I made it through. All six days. I'm not going to say there wasn't any hesitation. Some days, I didn't get in my workout until 2pm, when I wanted to try to stick to doing it pretty much as soon as I get home from taking Jonah to school. But it doesn't matter when I worked out, the point is, I didn't skip a workout. Go me! Just 72 more to go.

So, I actually didn't do my fit test first, and I really should before I get further into the workout, if I'm going to do it. In just a week, I can tell I can do somethings better than I could before I started. No, seriously! Already! My flexibility is coming back, my lung capacity and stamina are coming back. I'm sure as I get used to this routine (right before they change it up on me), I'll be able to do even more for even longer with even more weight.

I'm doing the ""Leans"" schedule of the plan because it focuses more on cardio than strength training. There's a ""Classic"" schedule and a ""Doubles"" schedule, where three days a week you add cardio on top of your strength training for the day. They all use all of the discs (I think), but some just focus on other things and some are just for crazy people.

I made a calendar so I could keep really short notes about how that day's workout felt. Just a few words to comment on how it went, what was hard or what I could do to make it better next time. Here's how the week went...

<lj-cut text=""Week 1""><b>Monday</b> - <i>Core Synergistics</i> - Need weights. Wear shoes. Wish they showed more modifications.

<b>Tuesday</b> - <i>Cardio X</i> - Sun Salutations hurt in shoes. Good workout! Dreya Rolls are HARD! Skirt not so great. (Wondering if I should be working out in Vibrams.)

<b>Wednesday</b> - <i>Shoulders & Arms, Ab Ripper X</i> - OMG ABS!!!!!!!!! (Yes, nine exclamation points. I counted.)

<b>Thursday</b> - <i>Kenpo X</i> - Lower back pain on jumping jacks. Love kenpo! (Lower back pain concerns me. Shouldn't skip Ab Ripper tomorrow, future self.)

<b>Friday</b> - <i>Legs & Back, Ab Ripper X</i> - All pull ups chair assisted. Skipped Ab Ripper. (D'oh.)

<b>Saturday</b> - <i>Yoga X</i> - Broke down in tears somewhere around 45 mins in. (Yeah, uhm, don't skimp out on protein in the morning. Made the mistake of breaking routine and ate cereal that morning because ""it was just yoga"" I was doing that day.)

<b>Sunday</b> - <i>Rest or X Stretch</i> - Rested. And drank lots of beer and ate fried chicken and cheddar waffles for dinner. What? What am I even doing this for if not to be able to do that? I ate salads for dinner four nights last week. Delicious salads, but still.

I started the week at 203. I gained 2 lbs over the course of the week landing at 205. I'm not discouraged because I'm almost positive that's muscle mass (shut up! I weighed myself before the beer and chicken and waffles). I mean, I worked a bunch of shit that hasn't been worked in a really long time. And I'm going to do it all again this week and see what happens. It was hard, but doable. You just don't do what you can't do, but keep trying because eventually you'll be able to do it. Or that's the idea, I guess.

Namaste motherfuckers!
</lj-cut>

p.s. - I think I would use Tony Horton as a measurement on the scale of douchebaggery. As in, I would say, ""that guy is a total Tony Horton on the scale of douchebaggery."" And hypothetical conversation partner would say, ""yeah, but at least he's no Christian Bale."" ""Too true."" But I guess he gets the job done."

"event","Man, I miss talking about food. I really do. I've gotten so disenchanted with cooking lately because it starts to feel like such a chore when it becomes routine as it is. But we're still cooking some really awesome food because we just can't help ourselves.

We make a lot of pizza over the course of a year, and even that was becoming so routine I asked if we could take a break from it. So when I caved to Chris' requests, even he wanted to try something a little different. He watched a bunch of YouTube videos and read a bunch of blog posts and decided to try out a Chicago style deep dish in our springform pan with our standard dough recipe. Of course, this meant we were going to need more toppings than the meager antipasto that usually passes.

Trying to be at least somewhat fat conscious, I picked up a pound of some spicy Italian chicken sausage and some turkey pepperoni, a red and green bell pepper and a jar of sauce, because I hadn't planned to do pizza so hadn't made any lately. I removed the sausages from the casing and browned them in the iron skillet, then removed them with a slotted spoon (leaving what little fat was left from them, mostly olive oil I added to the pan) and cooked the bell peppers with some onions.

Chris prepped the pan with some butter and cornmeal then rolled out a top and bottom crust. He lined the pan with one crust, we layered in the toppings (or in this case, fillings), <a href=""https://twitter.com/mellymell/status/291910731518078978/photo/1"">some fresh basil I harvested from our aerogarden that day</a>, and sliced provolone, but no sauce yet. Then we topped that with the second crust and topped that with a generous amount of sauce. We baked it at 375 for about 45 minutes then pulled it out, set it on a rack to cool and removed the sides of the pan. It looked something like this:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8414941647/"" title=""IMG_20130118_195629 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8374/8414941647_f2e6c7ac03.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_20130118_195629""></a>

About an hour later, it looked something like this:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8416037542/"" title=""IMG_20130118_201427 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8416037542_056449c809.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_20130118_201427""></a>

Things I would do differently next time: Replace the olive oil in our dough recipe for butter and maybe use a thinner crust on the top or a bit less yeast or something. It kind of rose more than I'd like for Chicago style. But none of that stopped it from being absolutely delicious! We still had plenty of dough left over to make a personal pizza for Jonah and one that was probably a medium size for most pizzerias. But the deep dish alone fed us for two nights and the other pizzas served Jonah three times and me once for lunch. That's a lot of deliciousness, right there."

"event","I was a wee bit hysterical (well, silently and internally, because that's the kind of hysterical I get) last night over something very small and, in the end, insignificant. But I've done a bunch of reading today of the very reflective sort. It's proven to be good for my soul and my peace of mind. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/magazine/the-futile-pursuit-of-happiness.html?pagewanted=print&src=pm"">This was the last thing I read.</a> <a href=""http://therumpus.net/2013/01/thats-life/"">This was one of the first.</a>

There's a line in <i>The Futile Pursuit of Happiness</i> that struck me hard.

<i><blockquote>If you ask [people], 'What would you rather have, a broken leg or a trick knee?' they'd probably say, 'Trick knee.' And yet, if your goal is to accumulate maximum happiness over your lifetime, you just made the wrong choice. A trick knee is a bad thing to have.''</blockquote></i>

I sort of graphed this in my head and saw this line graph with a really tall, though sharp peak when thinking about the broken leg and this long, drawn out, steadily rising line for the trick knee. And I suddenly understood a lot about what I was dealing with how little it's going to matter in the grand scheme of things and I was able to breathe again. I think this is going to be my new anti-anxiety mantra. Anytime I'm stalling and avoiding a decision because I'm afraid I'll suffer discomfort or even pain because of it, I need to think about that line graph in my head."

"event","Which is precisely why I'm thinking about gardening. I can bundle up in some fleece indoors and dream of spring, with my online seed catalogs and my spreadsheets and junk. Normally, I'd just sit down with my notebook and my paper seed catalogs and some graph paper and come up with something I wouldn't follow through on. We'll see if technology makes the difference. As with everything at the beginning of the year, I'm determined to make it work this time. I slacked in a spectacular way last year. So bad that I didn't plant pansies in the fall for the first time since we've lived here. I just didn't have the heart for it and it's a lot of work if you're just not into it.

But I'm into it! Bigger and better than ever. I've gained a lot of experience of what works and what doesn't over the years of landscaping and vegetable gardening in this yard. I know a lot of what not to do, for sure. It's getting easier to maintain something even when I'm at the height of my laziness. But after paying for a CSA last year and seeing all the awesome veggies I'm not growing, I decided this is the year I need to step it up a bit.

We don't really have any other major outdoor projects planned this year. I wanted to get Jonah a new swingset/playground thingy, which was going to mean landscaping a whole corner of the yard for that and building the structure, not to mention the cost. But Chris doesn't really want to do that and I can't really argue. There are enough other things around to keep us busy this year and we are just a short walk from the neighborhood playground. I know he wants to take on a major indoor project (like gutting our kitchen), but I'm going to try to sway him to hold off and join me in finishing up all the projects around the house before we start anything else major. Hardwood floors that were started in August of 2011, anyone? Sure would like to have ""baseboards and transitions"" off my to do list. But I digress. With no patios or decks to build this year and if I concede and say no playgrounds either, that leaves me able to dig a couple of new beds and do some borders on others that need them.

On the insanely sunny side of the house, where the grass turns to crisp death by June, I'm going to build two more raised beds right up against the house. One will be the new home for my raspberries to go nuts in. The other, well, I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with it. It'll be right up against the garden shed and I thought about putting some tall ornamentals like hardy banana trees in there or something to make the view out the window above it more pleasant. But I'm thinking about breaking down our first vegetable plots in the next year or two as they're starting to rot and fall apart anyway and I could use the extra space for edibles too. I'll figure it out once it's in, I guess. The front bed desperately needs a new border, as does the one on the back of the house that now extends around the HVAC units to the patio. It would be nice to do something that matched the interlocking block retaining wall we built around the herb garden on the other side of the patio, but that's a huge job and might not happen this year. Priorities are on these two new beds and the front.

I'm determined to start as much as I possibly can from seed this year, too. My goal is to get my flats set up and seeds sown by the end of the month. And some wheatgrass sprouted in another location so Mogwai won't eat all my sprouts. I've got my current seed inventory done. I've ordered what I'm missing. I'm going to try out several new things this year, like kale and collards and Brussels sprouts. Let's do this!"

"event","I've been saying it since this time last year, but I'm actually about to start P90X. As in Monday morning.

I assembled my pull up bar yesterday (and quickly found out I can do exactly one pull up, very painfully). I also found all the literature and stuff online since all I had to start with was the dvds (no literature or equipment, had to get that separate). I worked up my own spreadsheet of the program's schedule and a calendar, since I'm altering the plan slightly so that yoga always falls on Saturdays. I'm hoping I can get Chris to do at least that with me because he desperately needs to add some yoga into his workout schedule. He's constantly complaining about aches and pains and he lifts weights and runs 6 days a week. He freaking needs to stretch or he's going to seriously injure himself! But he doesn't want to do a yoga class at the Y because ""they're full of women."" *sigh* What is it with men? Seriously!

Today, I'm going to do my fit test and read up on my literature so I'm ready to start on Monday. I'm a little anxious. I know it's going to be really, really hard. I'm probably going to do nothing but complain about how much everything hurts for the next 13 weeks. But, I'm hoping that it'll help me shed the last 25 or so pounds I have to lose before I'm in the ""healthy"" BMI range for my body. As it turns out, I'll be finishing the Saturday before my birthday (my last day will be April 20th). There will be much cause for celebration. I'm going to spend the next 48 hours committing myself to doing this. No backsies and no missing workouts unless I'm bedridden.

I won't be running while doing this because 90 minutes a day is all I can possibly spare for exercise. Plus, it's cold and I hate the cold and I hate treadmills. Luckily when I'm finished, it will be spring and beautiful and I'll be ready to run again. I want to do another half-marathon in the fall, so I'll probably pick up that training as soon as I'm done in order to maintain. And plus, running is fun and I miss it and I know Chris misses doing his long runs with me. Plus, I still have that 5k in 30 minutes or less goal to reach.

<lj-cut text=""And here's where I get all reflective and long winded about weight loss and body image."">Weight maintenance. That's a foreign concept to me. I can't remember a time in my life (well, since childhood) when I wasn't overweight and wanting to lose at least 15 pounds. Even when I was in really good shape and playing three sports year round in high school. I was still, medically speaking, ""overweight"". 

And I don't know how much of that has to do with a skewed body image and how much of it has to do with reality. I can say that last year I developed perhaps the most healthy body image I've had since ever. I can thank burlesque for a lot of that. But a lot of it also has to do with getting naked in front of a camera. I read ""Shameless"" by Pamela Madsen and she was instructed to do this mirror exercise where she was supposed to stare at herself naked and focus on what she liked about her body instead of what she wanted to change. At first, she felt uncomfortable looking at herself in the mirror because she only knew how to be critical. But eventually, she only saw the things she loved about her body. The positive drowned out the negative, as it does if you let it.

I did sort of the same thing, even before I picked up her book, but I used a camera instead of a mirror. And I'm glad I did. Because I can go back and look at the photos and tell what I was thinking about myself at the time by how I posed or the expression on my face. I was able to appreciate my body even before I lost the weight. In fact, just as it worked for Pam, I feel my positive attitude toward my body was a greater catalyst for the weight loss than the focus on diet and exercise. Because quite honestly, I've focused on diet and exercise a lot more intensely in the past than I did last year. But never have I seen the sort of results I did in 2012 after I started looking at myself differently.</lj-cut>

I'm finally ready to talk numbers, too. At my heaviest post-pregnancy, I weighed 239 (late 2011). That's as much as a slim Homer Simpson (which I why I was embarrassed to say I weighed that much). Incidentally, I wasn't much more than that at my very last OB appointment right before having Jonah. I just recently found that out when I signed up for My Health Vanderbilt where I can track my medical charts online. They've got all my vitals from every visit to any Vandy Medical professional's office since 2006 when I started going to them and I can see my gain and then my loss right there in the chart. I'm starting out this year at 203. I'm aiming at getting under 180 (180 being the very top range of a healthy weight for someone of my height/build).

I can do this. Two thirds of my total weight loss goal is out of the way. I'm on the home stretch now. This is like that part in the run where I think, ""I've already come this far, it would be really stupid to stop now."""

I know, I'm supposed to be focusing on half-finished projects. And you know what? I am! Yesterday, I tried on all my Angel gown pieces and marked where I need to take them in, hem, adjust, etc. while I wait on that lovely trim to come in. The lace for underneath the bullion trim came and it's going to be perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I just have to pull the netting and stitching off that makes it ruffled so it will lay flat. And once I get the overgown taken in to my liking (man, like a ton! Half inch on each side seam and probably two inches on the center back seam), I'll start the endless beading there. Seriously, every edge of that thing except the hem (I'm not stupid) will be getting a treatment of bugle and seed beads. I keep looking at the stuff at MJ Trims and thinking, ""damn, that would be a hell of a lot easier."" But it's still not worth $10/yd to me to buy it. Maybe once I start I'll change my mind."

"event","I've been working on getting reorganized and figuring out what directions I want to head this year and when I came to my writing goals, I just jotted down that I wanted to finish a first draft of the first novel in the series I started writing about a couple of years ago. I outlined and researched and outlined some more and tried to start a first draft, but I hated it. The more I worked on it, the more I hated it. I was able to begin steering it into a direction of something that I wouldn't hate. But it wasn't unraveling like I wanted and so I abandoned it because there was no point in forcing it. 

I didn't have a deadline. It was something I was really just doing because I couldn't stand to have this story bouncing around in my noggin anymore. So there was really no pressure to continue working on something that I just wasn't that into. Then last year, I got completely sidetracked into personal essays and memoir and such. So I didn't really touch my documents at all. Almost willfully. I didn't want to see how bad it was. I knew how bad it was. I just wanted to start over.

So now, I have a shiny new MacBook Air (thanks to Chris, his gift to me for Christmas, even though I'm staunchly a Linux fan and I'm trying my best to refrain from wiping it and installing Ubuntu) and none of my files are copied over yet and I'm thinking about just starting from scratch with only my research intact. I've been trying to get more consistent about writing at 750words.com lately and I've had some really good streaks.

One day last week, I sat down and with nothing else in mind to write about, I started writing a plot summary. The next thing I knew, I breezed past 750 words and kept going into about 2100 words encompassing a very loose summary of three books covering two major conflicts. It was clear as day. My themes were surfacing. My romance was getting buried (thank god). And my major plot arcs were finally apparent. That was something with which I had struggled before. I had no idea what the story was about, just random scenes and vague ideas and some character sketches. I feel like I have a direction now and like I don't even need to write an outline, except that I sort of want to write my draft in outline format to make things easy to move around. If that makes any sense at all.

Which brings me to this question... anyone use Scrivener? It sort of looks like exactly what I want for trying to organize my pieces and parts in a way that's easy to make changes to and I really like the fact that I can include photos and stuff on a cork board sort of thing, since I'm a very visual thinker. But I kind of wanted to see if any of my writer friends used something like this and what they though of it first. Because at $45, it's not exactly an impulse buy when I can just outline in Libre for free.

Anyway, for once I feel like I can do this. I'm going to pick up all my writing reference books again and just start putting words on a page until I can figure this thing out. And maybe this time next year I can say I finished a first draft. That'll be HUGE for me!"

"event","It went to the holidays and a certain little boy's sixth birthday and an open house I threw for me and a few friends to sell some jewelry before Christmas. And here we are and it's CostumingMay already!

I've been thinking. It's what I do best, really. I'm going to approach this a little differently. I mean, I have <a href=""http://mellymell.livejournal.com/380163.html"">my list.</a> But I don't want to get so wrapped up in looking ahead that I don't work on what's right here in front of me. Namely things like the Angel gown that only needs to be taken in and have trim put on it to be completely done. And Celeborn, yes, him too.

So, before I start on new armor for Batgirl or attempting to screen print lycra fabric for Black Widow, I'm going to finish things that I already have stuff for. Particularly things that I shouldn't have to spend another dime on. Particularly as I just blew all my Christmas money on equipment to start P90X (but that's another post) and trims for the Angel gown.

I know, I know. ""What happened to all that trim you embroidered for the Angel gown years ago?!"" Well, I hate it, that's what. Well, I don't hate it, but it's just not elvish enough. I mean, looking at the reference images, the pattern of it really is spot on, but even with all the added silver to fancy it up a bit, I just can't get over how, I don't know, country looking it is. It's cotton, so there's that. Elves don't wear cotton. But it just doesn't sit right with me and that's part of why I've been hesitant to keep working on it (I lack about 6 inches from having enough of it embroidered and then I was going to bead it like crazy).

So, I turned to trusty old ebay and began my search, again, for just the perfect lace or embroidered trim. Of course I didn't find anything perfect, but I did find <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/160874872811?ssPageName=STRK:MESINDXX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1436.l2649"">this</a> which is gorgeous, but at 1.75"" wide, isn't quite wide enough. I stewed about it for a few days and I looked for lace trims that I could possibly layer with it to make it seem wide enough. I mulled over probably 20 different lace trims from all sorts of avenues and looked at lots of saris and other trim resources to see if maybe there was something else that I could buy that would give me the right width and overall look in a single trim. White and silver are not colors that saris often come in, I found out. Like almost never, it seems. At least not without some other colors in there as well.

But this morning, determined to be decisive, I ordered the above, too narrow trim from Heritage Trading and then <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/170941697511?var=470216194895&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2648"">purchased this</a> little 1.25"" wide white and silver gathered lace as sort of a border that will lay under it just a bit making it look like one 3"" or so wide piece of lace that's been heavily embroidered. Hopefully. I'm hoping the gathered bit is easily removed so I can lay it flat.

Of course, I also got sidetracked by <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/160943911135?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2648"">these</a> <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/130828311049?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2648"">pretties</a> which I instantly purchased because I suck and they were priced right and they're FREAKING GORGEOUS! I'm thinking an original Galadriel design may be in my future. Or perhaps a Celebrian? But I'm not going to think about that right now.

So my short list, as far as finishing what I've started is:
<b>Arwen Angel</b> - Take it in and trim that bitch out! And hem the undergown(s). I swore I had already done that, but apparently not.
<b>Celeborn</b> - *sigh*
<b>Lady Wolverine</b> - Make claws, alter jacket and add leather stripes to sleeves and hem, and buy or make a belt to fit the buckle.
<b>ANH Leia</b> - At least finish the robe and belt because they're both wicked close to being done. I still need to buy some stuff to wear the costume (like colored hair spray and boots).

I know I took Leia off my list, but it's stupid not to finish her, even if I don't really have specific plans to wear her. Comfy day costumes for Dragon*Con and Halloween staples are always welcome additions to my costume wardrobe and she fills both of those categories."

"event","I've never done this meme before, but I've been trying to write a recap of my year and it's just not coming, so I thought this would be easier. And if I stick with it from here on out, I'll have a pretty good metric going, I think.

<lj-cut text=""How my year looked, according to a predermined set of questions."">1. What did you do in 2012 that you'd never done before?
Ran a half-marathon, went kayaking, and took burlesque classes. That's really all I can think of right now.

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?  
I didn't make any last year. I've made a couple this year, though. Maybe one of them needs to be ""do more new things"".

3. Did anyone close to you give birth? 
One or two.

4. Did anyone close to you die?
My stepmother and an uncle (the first of my father's siblings to pass). Then I lost another uncle on Christmas day. But he was the most racist, abusive, alcoholic, chain-smoking asshole I've ever me, so I don't know if I count it as a loss. I hear the lung cancer had really mellowed him out, though.

5.What countries/states did you visit?
I've still never been out of the country, and honestly, we stayed pretty close to home most of the year. We hit Florida a couple of times (Disney once, the Keys once), North Carolina once (Asheville), Georgia once (Atlanta for D*C), Kentucky once (Holiday World), and Alabama quite regularly (family and friends in Huntsville). We were supposed to get in a trip to see my grandmother in Indiana right after Christmas, but she told me to postpone since they were having a blizzard so bad that they weren't even sending the plows out into it.

6. What would you like to have in 2013 that you lacked in 2012?
Sanity. Courage. Drive.

7. What dates from 2012 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
The day my stepmother died, for obvious reasons. The election. The release of The Hobbit and the guy who saw me in my Arwen Angel gown and asked if I was married and said I was prettier than Arwen. Dragon*Con. Our Key West trip. Taking Jonah to Brewgrass for the first time.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
Finishing my first half-marathon and the related weight loss (total of 40 pounds lost for 2012). I wore my prom dress for New Year's Eve. :)

9. What was your biggest failure?
Good god, there are so many. Celeborn is clearing his throat loudly in the corner, but I don't know if he's my biggest failure. I think my biggest failure is just generally failing to do things I said I would for friends for whatever reasons. 

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Only minor, thank god.

11. What was the best thing you bought?
Hmm, I don't know. Maybe our couch? Otherwise probably lumber and tiles that we used to remodel our patio or perhaps the travertine we used on the new hearth for the fireplace. Typically, money spent on our house is money well spent, as far as I'm concerned.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?
My dad. He's been a rock for so many of us even though of all of us, he has the most cause to fall to pieces. He's been patient with those who arguably don't deserve it. He's been supportive and comforting to those who didn't know where else to seek help. He's always calm and measured and has made so many difficult decisions with a level-headedness that I can only aspire to emulate.

13. Who's behavior made you appalled and depressed?
I think the general public attitude leading up to and immediately following the election was deplorable.

14. Where did most of your money go?
I don't know, probably home improvement, if we're talking about non-essential spending after bills are paid.

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
The Hobbit.

16. What song will always remind you of 2012?
Amanda Palmer's ""Smile (Pictures or It Didn't Happen)"" from the <i>Theatre is Evil</i> album with The Grand Theft Orchestra. But, if I'm really honest, that whole album was kind of my anthem for the year. I mean, I kind of trivially put ""Smile..."" above ""Trout Heart Replica"" or ""Want It Back"" or ""From St. Kilda To Fitzroy"" or ""Lost"". Actually, ""Lost"". That's the one.
<lj-embed id=""18""/>

17. Compared to this time last year are you?
Pretty much the same, but 40 pounds lighter and maybe a little more fragile, but that's hard to say.

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Traveling. Hiking. Camping. Reading.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Being depressed and apathetic.

20. How did you spend Christmas?
Chris' parents came up on Christmas Eve and my brother-in-law and his girlfriend came over Christmas day in the late afternoon for presents and an incredible dinner of smoked prime rib, roasted fingerling potatoes, Alton Brown's Brussels sprouts with bleu cheese and bacon (a now highly requested staple of every holiday meal) and a mixed green salad with a homemade holiday spiced dijion vinaigrette. Then we all played Mouse Trap (one of Jonah's Christmas presents) and had drinks and dessert before brother-in-law and his girlfriend eventually took off. We normally try to fit them in earlier in the day and they always have to rush off to her various family obligations. It was nice to have time with them for once.

21. Did you fall in love in 2012?
I did, all over again. Our Key West trip was like a second honeymoon... or a first one since we never really took one to begin with.

22. How many one-night stands.
Uh...

23. What was your favorite TV program?
Portlandia and Bob's Burgers tie for first.

24. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
Hate is a strong word and it smells bad, too.

25. What was the best book you read?
Cheryl Strayed's <i>Wild</i>

26. What was your greatest musical discovery?
Amanda Palmer, See above and see also:
<lj-embed id=""19""/>

It's ridiculous. I've followed her blog and her twitter and even ""listened"" to her music with Dresden Dolls for years, but she never really hooked me except from a philosophical and ""married to Neil Gaiman"" standpoint (though I followed her before they started dating). I backed her wildly successful Kickstarter for <i>Theatre Is Evil</i> and when the album came out, I was floored. It's easily her best work, but that's not to discount her other work. I don't know, I just never really <i>heard</i> her before this year. It never really sunk in. Was always just background music or something I listened to while waiting to listen to something else. I feel like things come to you as you're ready to accept them and she was one of those. I'm glad I finally came around because she's got a lot of awesome things to say in her music as well as her online outlets for expression.

27. What did you want and get?
A new sense of self. I still have a lot of work to do, but all the writing I did in 2012 was purely for the purpose of digging up long forgotten ghosts and imprisoning them on the page, allowing me to move forward freely. I called it my accidental memoir but really, it was free therapy sessions. I also call it my emancipation proclamation.

28. What did you want and not get?
A new garden for my raspberries. That's something that HAS to happen this year because the river birch they're under is big enough now to shade them out and I believe that's why we got a fraction of the fruit we usually do last year.

29. What was your favorite film this year?
The Hobbit.

30. What did you do for your birthday, and how old were you?
I think I tiled a patio and/or worked on framing out a deck. I know we went out to dinner, too. But there wasn't a big hurrah. I turned 31. That Mad Tea Party is still on the table for ""someday"". Maybe by the time I turn 35.

31. What one thing would have made your year immeasureably more satisfying?
Finding my drive again. My desire to move forward instead of lying down and letting come what may.

32. What was your fashion concept for 2012?
Uh... I don't know. Does t-shirt and jeans count as a ""fashion concept""? I did work on some original designs for special occasion dresses, though. I've got this asymmetrical black silk velvet dress to put together that I just found the most perfect embellishment for so I'll be finishing that soonish, maybe in time for the next Music City Burlesque show.

33. What kept you sane?
Writing and my tattoo that was done specifically for that purpose. For the most part, it's working. When I'm breaking down, I can stare at it and any feelings I have about giving up feel like a betrayal of what's now imbedded into my skin.

34. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most.
Stoya. Yes, the porn star. And no not necessarily because of her porn. That's the least of her accomplishments, I think. I follow her blog. She's really well read and thinks and writes about really awesome things. Plus, she's gorgeous and without a hint of fake physicality.

35. What political issue stirred you the most?
The cult of ignorance, rape culture, and gun control.

36. Who do you miss?
""I miss my drummer, my dead step-brother, and the pit croooooooowwwd, and Chuck and Matty, if they could see me they'd be soooooo prooooooouuuuuud."" *ahem* Sorry, still hearing ""Lost"" in my head.

No really, I miss my step-mother, of course. I still miss my mother on occasion, even though she's been dead for 18 years now. And Mary, who passed 14 years ago last week. And Mike and Beaudeatte and all the others who were taken too soon.

Most of all, I miss my best friend, Brandy, who is on the other side of the country. We talk in texts almost every day, but the distance between us has grown palpable.

I also miss myself, sometimes.

37. Who was the best new person you met?
Tough call. I met a lot of really great people. But I feel the most connected to Kayla from burlesque class. I don't know, we just clicked really well.

38. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2012.
That dredging the deep wells of hurt in your memory can be more painful than the hurt was when you first went through it. But it's a necessary step in truly healing. For something to be created, you must first destroy what stands in the way. Out of the ashes... and all that jazz.

39. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:
""No one's ever lost forever, they are caught inside your heart. If you garden them and water them, they make you what you are."" - Amanda Palmer and The Grand Theft Orchestra from ""Lost"", of course.</lj-cut>

Looking forward, I'm realizing just how much time I spent in my head last year. I have huge blocks of time that I feel like nothing happened because I spent that time writing out my inner thoughts or just sitting and thinking and meditating. It's nearly as bad as the years of my late teens and early 20s that were spent in a drug and alcohol haze, except I was completely sober. I found that even when I was with people, I wasn't really present. If there's one thing I want to do differently this year, it's that I want to be more present. I don't want to lose this introspection because I just wind up feeling shallow when I do that. But I need to find a way to balance that with sharing a life with the people I love. I feel like I've missed out on so much of your lives because I was so wrapped up in my own. I need to force myself out into the world more often.

As Amanda Palmer would say, namaste motherfuckers.

I need that on a shirt."

"event","So, I had kind of a fail of a CostumeFebruary. I blame my spectacular ability to find a million other things I ""should"" be doing instead of working on costumes. Let's revisit my list, shall we?

<b>Lady Wolverine</b> - Fail. Ran out of budget and subsequently ran out of will to try to pull it together with what I already had. I probably won't get back to this until the first of the year, aka CostumingMay.
<b>Elseworld Batgirl</b> - Fail. I basically just didn't feel like working on her, so I didn't. I've got a sheet of Sintra with her 2.0 armor pieces all marked off and ready to be cut, but I just didn't care enough. Again, probably won't revisit this until CostumingMay.
<b>Celeborn</b> - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! No, really I did do a few things, like that <a href=""http://mellymell.livejournal.com/379574.html"">fabric dyeing adventure I posted about</a> and I've finished the endless ironing on the damask I'm making his robe from, which is actually a huge deal. I've got exactly 30 days to get him to wearable for the Hobbit midnight premiere, which I'VE GOT MY TICKET FOR BITCHES! Locals, we're going to the Opry Mills theater at 12:05, the High Frame Rate 3D showing and then probably again to a Saturday matinee when more people are available and the kids could possibly join us.
<b>Sexy Gandalf</b> - Success! Fixed his hat, said fuck it on the gloves and I'm calling him done and permanently off my list. I wore him to two Halloween parties and the one night I attended GMX.
<b>Katniss Arena for a 9-year-old</b> - Success! She looked freakin' spectacular! I need to see if I can get the pics from her mom and get her permission to post them because this turned out really great, even if we had some technical difficulties with making the bow and such.
<b>Zombie for a 5-year-old</b> - <a href=""http://mellymell.livejournal.com/379217.html"">Success!</a>

Let's revisit the overall list of what want to accomplish before next Costuming New Year (aka Dragon*Con).

<lj-cut text=""It is stupid how much this has changed in two months and even more stupid how much it will continue to change in the next ten months.""><a href=""http://mellymell.livejournal.com/375316.html"">Here's what I originally said I wanted to do</a> And here's that list revised to reflect the current state of affairs:

<u>In progress/Collected materials for:</u>
<b>Celeborn</b>
<b>Arwen Angel Gown</b>
<strike>A New Hope Leia</strike>
<strike>Lamia</strike>
<strike>Historical Aurora</strike>
<b>Lady Wolverine</b>
<strike>Super Sekrit Project #UWS01 It was Selene from Underworld, specifically the second movie with the magnetic holsters for the Walther P99s. Yes, I've sourced EVERYTHING! I already have a kit from a guy in the UK who's going to cast some custom fangs for me. But I think I'm going to switch it over to Sonja from Rise of the Lycans. I mean, armor and swords and chainmail OH MY! I don't expect to have it done in a year. But I want to have it on my list of current projects and work on pieces as I'm able.</strike>

<u>Repairs/upgrades:</u>
<b>Blood Red Gown</b> - hem or line sleeves, finally sew on braided trim to edge the bullion, consider refitting upper sleeves, consider weighting the undergown to keep it from creeping up and maybe hooks and eyes to keep overgown straps in place.
<b>Dream Gown</b> - Redo all hems with rolled hem foot. I almost don't want to wear that costume again until I can fix those embarrassingly messy hems. At the time, it was the best I could do. That is no longer the case.
<b>Elseworld Batgirl</b> - remake all the armor from Sintra with velcro attachment to suit instead of snaps, take in the suit (or replace it) and consider making an applique for the emblem to cover up my sloppy stencil paint job, make detachable gloves or maybe velcro closed slit at wrists so I can at least free my hands from the suit when necessary, finish kneepads, finish installing boot soles on suit, eventually work on either molded leather version of cowl or get the guy on RPF I was talking to do a custom latex one for me.

<u>The Wishlist</u>:
<b>Elvish Bathing Suit</b> - This will probably consist of me appliqueing something elvish to a store bought bathing suit.
<b>Thranduil</b>, based on the image that came out with the crazy spiky crown and the weird looking metallic gold fabric. I may go with a brocade and/or a taffeta instead of something that's more accurate. But I want that crown!
<b>Amrod</b>, The Weasley Twin of the Feanorians, collaboration with Becca who has agreed to be Amras.
<strike>Merida from Brave</strike>
<strike>Maleficent</strike>
<strike>Aisling from The Secret of Kells</strike>
<strike>Sweet Pea from Sucker Punch</strike>
<b>Avengers Black Widow</b> DAMN YOU KATE!
<b>Lili von Shtupp Black Cabaret <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8182410828/"">from Blazing Saddles</a></b> because I still haven't learned to shut up on costuming threads and not say things like ""I've always wanted to make that!"" because that automatically recruits me to do just that.

So there's that.

"event","Before Chris left for work yesterday morning, he noted that he hadn't seen Mogwai (our cat) at all since he left home Thursday morning for work. I didn't really think anything of the fact that I hadn't heard constant, desperate meowing in the morning like usual. I hadn't really seen or heard him since Thursday afternoon when he desperately wanted to come out and see what I was up to in the garage (preparing a frame to hang some pegboard in the office closet and repairing the drawer from the desk in there so I can put all my stuff back in it, in case anyone besides the cat was curious).

After taking Jonah to school, I made it my quest to search out the cat, where ever he may be hiding. I looked literally every where in our house. Even places that there's no logical way he'd get into like the closed up attics. Because if there's anything cats aren't, it's logical. I know he went into the garage and I was pretty sure that was the last time I saw him and I noticed there's a tiny crack under the garage door where, although unlikely, it's possible he could have gotten out. So, with the assumption that he escaped the premises, I fortified myself with a cup of coffee, laced up my hiking boots, wrapped up in my warmest hoody and ventured out into the thawing morning on what would become a wild goose chase, if it hadn't been a domestic cat chase instead.

I wandered the tree line and the field behind our house, checking out the awesome treehouse our neighbors are building by the creek. Then I made my way to the front of the house and started up towards the pool and the playground area and the woods behind them where we found him the last time he got lost. But as I was traipsing around through the woods, clicking my tongue and calling to my stupid cat (who, by the way, turned up in the garage about three hours later), I literally almost ran into this:

<lj-cut text=""More pics and details this way."">That is the only stone of many that is standing in its entirety and even a bottom corner of it is chipped off. I thought it was completely blank at first, but I noticed the initials <strike>B.</strike> (see ETA below) R. E. H. as I looked closer.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8170411494/"" title=""IMG_20121109_085259 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8170411494_52307f170a.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_20121109_085259""></a>

Actually, the contrast on my phone screen was very helpful in making out some of the details better than I could with my naked eye.  I looked around to see several more smaller stones and started poking around, snapping pics and uncovering larger stones which had fallen or been knocked down at some point. The full set is <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/sets/72157631976745278/"">here.</a>

Only one other stone had an inscription beyond something strictly decorative and it was in three pieces on the ground. From what I could make out, it says, ""In memory of <strike>[can't make out the full first name, but I can see what I think is chel as the last four letters]</strike> (see ETA below) Rachel E. Howington who was born Feb. 15th, 1813 and departed this life Oct. 2nd, 1889"". I did a cursory Google search on my phone while I was standing there, excited about my discovery and hoping to find some record of this person and perhaps a clue as to who they were and maybe who the others might be that are buried there. I haven't found anything as of yet. The age on it is bound to make that difficult and I'll probably have to read a bunch of really lengthy books dealing with the history of the area to find even a possible mention of this person. But I just think it's so neat to have this little slice of hidden history up there!

Jonah wanted to see it today, so I took him up there. He took Giraffie because he was a bit spooked out by the prospect, but too curious not to want to go up there. Once we got there, he realized there was really nothing spooky about it. It's just a few broken headstones in the woods.
</lj-cut>

ETA: RACHEL E. HOWINGTON! That's a footstone with the initials, I'm sure and it's R. E. H. not B. E. H. I looked at the pics one more time and I noticed the partial letter before the CHEL of the first name looked a bit like the leg of an A and then it clicked and I looked at the B. again on the footstone and sure enough, I'm pretty sure it's an R. Sadly, again, given the era this is from, it still doesn't give me much to go on and I still can't find a Rachel E. Howington in this area with those dates, but it's something. I've found Howingtons in the immediate area (as close as an area called Scottsboro on Ashland City Highway just north of I-40 where there's another Howington family cemetery), but not Rachel E., yet. Considering this area was settled in the late 1770s/early 1780s, she could have been a second generation settler. Fun stuff!"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Likely the only political post you&#39;ll ever see me make, with perhaps the unforeseen exception of a specific issue on which I might want to raise awareness."">I was in sixth grade and I had made the All-City Choir which is a thing you had to try out for and they did a big concert after a few weeks of rehearsals. I can't remember if it was all middle grades together or if I was in a specific group made up of only sixth graders. That doesn't really matter much. Because eighth graders can't vote any more than sixth graders can vote.

So, I was at rehearsal one night and maybe they were working on the boys part or something because the two girls next to me were talking about something and I was doing my best to politely ignore them so as not to be thought of as nosy. I didn't really know anyone there. Or if I did, I wasn't seated anywhere near them, since they arranged us first by voice (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) and then by height so that we'd all be seen on the risers. I was almost always in the back row... because I've always been an elf. Even in preschool I was the tallest kid in the class.

But anyway, they were talking and giggling and trying not to get caught. And I was ignoring them because this was the year that school kind of broke my spirit and I was always on guard because I was always getting picked on for being one of the only white kids in school. These girls were white. I thought there was less of a chance of them picking on me. Maybe. But I was wrong in the most ridiculous way.

At one point they both turned to me and asked, ""so, are you for George Bush or Bill Clinton?"" I just stared at them blankly with this look like, ""uhm, did you really just ask me that? What the fuck does it matter who I'm for? I'm ten years old and so are you probably."" I squeaked out a timid, ""I don't know."" They looked at each other smugly and said, ""she's probably for Ross Perot."" And giggled to themselves. We didn't say a word to each other through any other practice or the performance.

But I sat there, feeling dejected. And feeling really, really confused at why I felt dejected. I had no idea who stood for what and who had what policy on what big adult problem I tried not to bother my sixth grader head with. I knew only what I had seen in Saturday Night Live skits with Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman (rest his soul... aw, now I'm sad). I'm pretty sure these girls had no idea except what they heard their parents talk about at the dinner table every night. It wasn't like they weighed the issues and made up their own minds. And there's still the huge glaring fact that none of this should fucking matter to a middle school student who has at least five more years, or more than likely eight, before they can vote.

I was raised under the notion that it wasn't polite to discuss politics in mixed company. My mom would never even tell me who she voted for. She always said you don't tell people. It invites conflict. This was the household I grew up in. She listened to Rush Limbaugh everyday, but I couldn't really make out what point he was trying to make through the sound of loudly rustled papers and throat clearing. So I never really understood what side he was on until I was older and as a kid, it wasn't really my job to care. Knowing what I know now, I can guess how she probably voted. But since I was still so many years off from voting age, I really didn't make it my business to follow politics, as if I could fully understand it anyway. As if these girls could fully understand it.

Their smug laughter at my expense stung just as much as if they had made fun of the way I wore my hair or the music I listened to or the way I talked or something else I thought defined me at the time. And I sat there, distracted for the rest of the night trying to figure out why this bothered me. Really, it was just their tone of false superiority. And that rings true through any sort of bullying. It doesn't really matter what the bully is making fun of you for. That they lord it over you that they have something better is really all that matters, even if it's completely baseless (because it almost always is). Even if you shake it off, there's always this nagging feeling that you should have stood up for yourself instead of falling into the script of the victim. That you should have said something to make them feel stupid for laughing at you. Turned it around on them. I guess Gandhi would be proud that I didn't. And I guess I've learned not to engage idiots in processing this experience. The value of the lesson is not lost on me, but I hate that I had to sit there and squirm like there was something wrong with me because I didn't know, nor did I care, who I would vote for if I were 8 years older.

Now I look back on this and I think about those girls and where they are now and I think about the fact that they probably still don't know who stands for what and still probably haven't weighed the issues that are important to them and made up their own minds. I think they probably haven't because in my jaded outlook, I feel like a frightening majority of voters don't. They watch the news they prefer and narrow their scope to only those with whom they agree, never challenging their outlook. Never forcing themselves to objectively look at something. Always afraid to admit they might be wrong. Most people are constantly backing themselves further into whichever corner they feel the most comfortable.

I see it all the time, adults attacking each other like this. ""How can you be so stupid to believe [candidiate]'s lies?!"" As if there is such a thing as a politician who doesn't lie or at the very least isn't trying to bend the truth in an attempt to sell you on them and gain your vote. But this is scary. It's one thing for stupid sixth graders to think this way. It's another thing entirely for them to never grow out of it and become voting adults who think this way. It's bothered me now for 21 years. It's a game where no one wins. There's almost never an intelligent debate, even amongst people I know for a fact are extremely intelligent because they're my friends and loved ones and I know they're better than this. But for some reason, it always comes down to lowest common denominator. ""You don't agree with me so I'm going to insult your intelligence because the only way you wouldn't agree with me is if you're stupid.""

At ten years old, I checked out of the political process forever. I still show up to the polls on election day (or before). But apart from watching The Daily Show and The Colbert Report which both make a living laughing at this ridiculousness, I do not engage in the political process at all. Not even to say, ""I've voted!"" or ""I support [candidate]."" Because honestly, I haven't seen a candidate that I can say I support. I'll vote for one. But it comes down to how much I can tolerate them by degrees. I weigh the pros and cons the best I can and I check a box. I don't watch the news. I don't listen to the radio. I look shit up and try to verify it from multiple sources if I can (and if I can't, I throw that entire point out, because if you can't verify it, you shouldn't make a decision based on it). Then, I make a decision in the silent privacy of the voting booth. I mean, if you know me and know what's important to me, you can probably take a guess at who I might vote for. You might be wrong, but you could take a guess. And that doesn't mean that candidate has my support. It just means I think they might focus on what matters to me.

Honestly, I couldn't care less about the presidential election. I really, really don't care about those asshats anymore. I'm over it. I care more about getting a local guy to our State House of Representatives because of the awesome things he's done for our community as a City Council member. I just really can't be bothered by this bickering anymore. And I can't help but ponder the rantings of the tinfoil hat camp that all this is on purpose to keep us fighting each other so we don't notice the bullshit they're pulling while we're not looking. I don't really believe that, but it's hard not to think it sometimes.</lj-cut>"

"event","So, I'm staring down the barrel of a loaded gun in that I volunteered to dye and cut fringe into 21 t-shirts for Jonah's class tomorrow and have them back in time for them to paint them into Native American-ish costumes on Thursday. I do not know why I do these things to myself. 

But anyway, while I'm thinking about dyeing, I thought I'd put an update here about some dyeing I did right before Dragon*Con for Celeborn's obi and tabbard fabric.

<lj-cut text=""Because I'm avoiding more actual work on Celeborn even though we're now less than 39 days from the premiere of The Hobbit and he really needs to be done like three years ago..."">Here's a pic of the actual costume for reference:

I started with this:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/6053501974/"" title=""IMG_3790 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6083/6053501974_efb9506926.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_3790""></a>

Which is a dupioni called ""cornflower"" from <a href=""http://www.silkbaron.com"">Silk Baron</a>. Of all their blue tones, this was the closest to the hue I wanted, it was just a bit too saturated. So, I thought I could just strip a bit of the dye out and magically arrive at the lovely icy, pale blue of Celeborn's obi. So I got some Rit dye remover and dunked the fabric in and this is what happened instantaneously:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8159175802/"" title=""IMG_20120823_141253 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7135/8159175802_5c12b5f574.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_20120823_141253""></a>

Fuck. If I had known this would happen, I would have just bought undyed dupioni from Dharma Trading for like a ton cheaper. Oh well.

I scrambled through my dye drawer and found that I still had some periwinkle Fiber Reactive dye from my Dream gown. I mixed it up, prepared the dye vat, cut some swatches and after a few tests (and losing a swatch to the abyss of the vat when it slipped from my tongs), got something I was pretty happy with.

This is the final swatch:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8159176658/"" title=""IMG_20120823_142435 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8485/8159176658_5d43bf6e3c.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_20120823_142435""></a>

And the yardage once it dried:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8159180258/"" title=""IMG_20120823_213028 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7112/8159180258_8671ebc0a9.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_20120823_213028""></a>

And the yardage with the swatch of what it looked like initially:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8159180862/"" title=""IMG_20120823_213111 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7274/8159180862_9600a3781b.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_20120823_213111""></a>

And the yardage with the original swatch and the swatch that got lost in the abyss of the dye vat just for shits and giggles:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8159149737/"" title=""IMG_20120824_085425 by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8204/8159149737_7899d3567e.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_20120824_085425""></a>

Oversaturated periwinkle is pretty! It's also crazy how much it changes color depending on the light. It looks totally different in every picture here.

Interesting aside: I have two pieces of this dupioni that were originally from different dye lots (they're now both from my very own dye lot, thankyouverymuch). One of them got left folded up in a place where the sunlight hit it every single day. I don't know how long it sat there (a week or so, maybe?), but the color had actually faded to pretty much the perfect shade, but only on the part that was exposed to the sunlight. I don't know if this is reflective of Silk Baron's colorfastness of their dyes or anything, but it did cross my mind to just try hanging the entire yardage in the sun to get what I wanted. But I was afraid it wouldn't be even and I couldn't control it enough.

It was instantly gratifying and wicked fun, since it's just basically finding ways to destroy clothing (my weapons of choice were scissors, a box cutter, an orbital sander, a patch of dirt/mud in the yard, and homemade fake blood [corn syrup and food coloring]).

He later regretting choosing such a ""messy"" costume. Apparently he didn't realize that zombies were so messy. In retrospect, if I had made the costume early in the day, the fake blood would have dried and he wouldn't have had to worry about it. But as it was, it was still a bit sticky, so he had to be careful about how he played. I did at least have the foresight not to put any on his back so he could sit down. He also did not like the makeup. And by the way, trying to apply even a haphazard amount of makeup to a five year old's face is challenging enough. I don't freakin' see how pageant moms do it!"

"event","And he's been pretty nuts lately, as far as the ridiculous stuff that comes out of his mouth. He's starting to fully understand swear words. In that he can hear something with them in it and know not to repeat those words. He knows that it's okay to hear them but not say them. I hope this doesn't backfire, but it's unavoidable when a) your father is Chris and your mother is me and b) you take your kid to stuff like Ben Folds Five shows. The other day, I caught him singing along to Rock This Bitch For Freedom and had to tell him not to sing that word because it was a curse word. A moment later, he doubled over in laughter because he suddenly got why the song was funny. I have to admit, that was a pretty great moment in parenting, right there.

As for other hilariously ridiculous stuff he's said lately that are too long for tweets, he went to an all kids Halloween party on Saturday evening. There was a group of three boys and four girls. When I left, they were all split off, girls in one room, boys in another. Which is what always happens. But inevitably, the boys are going to plot together and go mess with the girls and the girls are going to get pissed and there's going to be a mild altercation and they'll have to be told to leave each other alone again. So, when I picked him up, Scarlet told me about this inevitable altercation, but she's had enough of these sorts of parties to know that's par for the course so she didn't think anything of it. I talked to Jonah about it a little bit while we were getting ready for bed and he admitted to ""messing with the girls."" I told him to not mess with girls. That if he's not going to be nice to a girl, he should just leave her alone. That they really hate that kind of stuff. He said, ""what if they're hot?!"" I said, ""especially if they're hot!"" Stifling laughter. Then, I seriously said, ""Jonah, if you like a girl and you think she's pretty, be nice to her. If you mess with her, she's not going to like you."" So, maybe he got a lesson out of it and maybe I can raise a more evolved breed of human male who doesn't have to suffer through that ""pull her hair 'cause she's cute"" phase... who am I kidding? That's exactly the road we're headed down. *sigh*

Saving the best until last, Jonah was tasked with a home<strike>work</strike>fun assignment last week to write a very short story with the prompt ""The spookiest thing"" and they had to dictate it to an adult and illustrate it themselves for it to go in a class book. Since he's all about zombies lately, he of course wrote a zombie story. I took it down in notes on my phone one day so that I could transcribe it later. This is all straight from his mouth. The only place I edited him was where he got way into detail about the setting. We only had like six lines to fill with text and we were describing a dead deer found in the woods that was kind of like the tree on Dagoba that was strong with the Dark Side of the Force, in that it was kind of confusing and didn't really move the story forward at all. But otherwise untouched, here's his story:

<blockquote><i>Once upon a time, there was a little house on a cul-de-sac with other big and little houses. One day they went to the graveyard and decided to raise the dead. So they made a potion and suddenly, when they poured it on the grave, an army of zombies and vampires rose up and started attacking. They tried to fight but they couldn't. Suddenly, they saw a light and it was a man with lasers and bombs and he blew up all the zombies and vampires and defeated them. The end.</i></blockquote>

And of course I really, really want to illustrate it."

"event","I haven't been talking about it much this year like I have in years past. I've not kept running numbers on LJ because it's all up at MapMyRun now and I don't have to keep up with it myself. But for the first time, I'm making huge progress on losing weight. Like more than losing and gaining the same 10 or 15 pounds like I was for the first three years after I started running. Now, I'm still terribly irregular about working out. I get busy and I don't run for weeks at a time. I've started over the three month strength training program at the Y because I didn't go for a month leading up to Dragon*Con everything else was kicking my ass. I was still losing weight by eating healthy, but I would have been doing even better if I had kept with the workouts. And really, it takes 15 minutes to do the five machines I do and another 15-30 minutes of cardio is all the plan calls for every other day. That should be my bare minimum workout that I fall back to when everything else gets to be too much, not my maximum. And it's been the maximum since July.

But there's burlesque, too. Hip shimmies are an awesome ab workout, chest shimmies get your back and shoulders working, football shimmies are both cardio and quad workouts and we have 16 counts of those, over and over and over... on four inch heels. But we also spend a fair amount of time stretching before and after and that's just good for your body to do on a regular basis. Gets the circulation going, stretches out muscles that get kinked up otherwise.

And it's not like I lead a sedentary lifestyle. I'm still at the point where I can go out any day of the week and run a decent 5k. I tried to explain that to Chris last night when he was encouraging me to start working out again. But still somehow, yesterday, I managed to slip into my prom dress. The one I wore my junior year of high school 14 years ago and haven't been able to fit into for a decade. I'm surprised I still have it, honestly. But I do. I asked him how he thinks that happens. That I'm still losing weight and toning muscles even though I don't ""workout"". It's tiling and gardening and cleaning and sewing (cutting fabric feels exactly like yoga the day after) and decluttering. It's being on my feet for so many hours of the day, making sure to keep moving constantly because if I don't, things don't get done and I fall behind and I'm far enough behind anyway.

Don't get me wrong, I believe I should also fit in time to workout. That bare minimum workout I described up there should be more than adequate to keep me fit and there's no reason I can't spend 30-45 minutes every other day to stay in shape and keep making progress on my goals. I'm not making excuses to not workout, I'm just saying that my needs and Chris' needs are going to be different. He's training for his second half marathon next month. He's doing a great job. He works out every other day and runs every other day with one rest day a week. He's lost like 40 pounds and he looks great! I've lost 30 (since January 1st, 10 of it since Dragon*Con, 5 last week while we were sick) and, well, I'm getting there. I can fit into my prom dress, but I look lumpy. I've got a lot of toning still to do and about another 30 pounds to be in my healthy range. But it's to the point where other people notice and that feels really good. Progress after so long of no progress feels really good.

Funny story about it, Jonah is very aware of how health conscious we've been this year. He constantly asks how much fat is in something and I've taught him to pick his cereals by looking at how much sugar is in them (Cookie Crisp has less than Frosted Shredded Wheat, if you can believe it). Asks ""is this healthy?"" when he can't determine if it is or not. And the other day, standing talking to a neighbor in the driveway, he said to her, ""know how she lost it?"" We had no idea what he was talking about. He knew in his head what he meant, but it was totally out of context. He pats my stomach and says, ""that. Your belly."" Then he turns to her and he starts saying, ""by going and exercising at the Y. You can take your kids there and they get to play in Y-Play and you can exercise. You should check it out."" And I just looked at her and said, ""they should pay him for marketing, shouldn't they?"" I was hoping she wouldn't take that to mean he was saying she was out of shape. Because she's really not. When we got in the house, I let Jonah know that she knew about the Y because she had been a member and recommended it to us for years before we finally joined. He just looked at me and said, ""oh."""

"event","So, you know how I posted that list of stuff I needed to get done in the costuming world of my life in the next *looks at calendar* 11 days? Yeah, so I got a stomach virus starting last Thursday, spent two days lounging and whining around the house trying to stay as comfortable as possible. By Saturday, Chris and I were both down to being mostly functional except when we were hungry or when we had just eaten, either of which sent sharp pains through our digestive systems.

I had spent my time sick in various places throughout the house. I couldn't just stay in bed watching TV. Chris was uncharacteristically doing just that. Most of what he was watching was HGTV. I remarked at one point how I'm at a place in my life now where that much HGTV doesn't affect me like it used to. A mere hour of it before would have me ripping something apart to remodel before the afternoon was up. 

We have a lot of projects that are unfinished around the house as it is, which is a major deterrent to starting anything new. You know <a href=""http://mellymell.livejournal.com/tag/home%20improvements"">all those projects I've posted about in the past</a>? There's probably at least one thing on every single one of them that still needs to be done to call it officially ""finished"". Except the guest bathroom. That's officially finished, but I'd like to add a medicine cabinet and a better fan, a light in the shower and now the towel bar needs to be replaced because it's also Jonah's bathroom and this is what kids do. Destroy things. Work is never done.

Anyway, when we put in our hardwoods last August(to present, inclusive), we pulled up our hearth which was a slab of marble that had been cracked in three places and needed to be replaced. We went without a fireplace last year and I sorely missed it. Plus, we've got this big ugly hole in the floor for a hearth where you just see the white underlayment on the subfloor. Roomba always falls in it and gets stuck. 

But really, rebuilding the hearth is low hanging fruit in the realm of ""projects that would get our flooring project closer to done"". But it's slightly higher hanging fruit than, say, ""re-hang all our artwork and wall decor from the painting we had done in the freaking spring"". I mean, that would be a reasonable task to undertake when you're starting to feel a little bit better after a couple of days of being sick. Not too heavy of labor and done in a couple of hours, tops. Or maybe ""finish recovering the other four dining room chairs so you can stop moving the cut fabric pieces around from place to place."" That's another good one.

By noon on Saturday, we were at Buy Floors Direct and by 12:38, we were walking out with two boxes of a lovely 4""x8"" travertine tile, just enough to do our 60""x20"" hole in the floor where a hearth goes.

Two days and several trips to home improvement stores later, we're halfway through tiling not only the hearth on the floor, but also the surround between the firebox and the mantle. Because there were slabs of marble there that matched the old hearth and they looked kind of yuck with the travertine we picked out (a 1""x2"" splitface travertine which looks kind of like rustic stacked stone, but perfect rectangles). I know, isn't that stupid? Similarly, when we finished the floors in the den, we bought a new (used) couch because our old ones looked shitty on the nice new floors. This is the retarded line of thinking you take up when you watch too much home improvement television. So, I'll be tiling for the rest of today and probably tomorrow.

We did take an hour break yesterday when we had a power outage and couldn't work. There is a busload of orphans from Uganda (a traveling choir) being housed in the neighborhood for the next week. Three of our neighbors are housing at least two kids each. So everyone was pulling out their spare bikes and scooters and whatever else they had on hand to give to the visiting kids to ride around the cul-de-sac. We are thoroughly domesticated. There's no doubt about it."

"event","So, it's Costuming February! Like a week into it, but whatever. I feel a bit like I'm swimming in open water right now. I'm desperately trying for order, but inspiration is hella impulsive and you sometimes just have to go where it drags you to get anything done at all. And sometimes you just have to stop looking at all the new Hobbit images and focus on the task at hand. Which is actually a list of several tasks. Actually several lists of several tasks.

<lj-cut text=""Those lists..."">So, on my immediate agenda, as in, have ready for GMX/Halloween in ~20 days:
<b>Lady Wolverine</b> - cut my claws from the pvc, sand/heat shape, paint, assemble claws; get leather for stripes and hem of jacket; alter jacket; pick up buckle from post office (LIKE A MOTHER FUCKING ADULT!); test out belt, buy belt leather if necessary; test run of full costume.

<b>Elseworld Batgirl</b> - cut out armor (I've got it drawn out on the Sintra already and everything, just sitting there), glue/shape armor, paint/seal armor, apply velcro to armor to attach to suit, take in catsuit and remove all unnecessary snaps, finish kneepads, try lenses in cowl one more time, and I think I'm just going to opt for wearing what have become Lady Wolverine's boots because I'd like to do a better suit at some point and don't want to put the effort into building in soles for this one.

<b>Celeborn</b> - Yes, Okay?! Here's a picture of my ironing board two days ago:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mellymell/8060533437/"" title=""Celeborn bitches! by mellymell, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8313/8060533437_8726d30714_z.jpg"" width=""480"" height=""640"" alt=""Celeborn bitches!""></a>

I've fixed his elven potato sackitude but somehow he's shrunk three inches in length or something. Admittedly, I wasn't trying him on with the proper undergarments. That's half of his pain-in-the-assness right there. Having to wear a binder in order to work on his mockup. I know, just suffer through this and I can finish him... and then have to wear a binder the entire time I wear him if I want him to look good. Wait... carry the two... Damn it!

Still to do: fix his sudden onset of hobbititus, remove the upper front panel and make the right side look more like the left side and I think I'll almost have that stupid fucking rolled collar fixed, fix any other mockup issues and get to cutting and sewing because the clock is ticking.

<b>Sexy Gandalf</b> - fix my tiny hat which has become detached in places and somewhat crushed, maybe another shot at the fishnet gloves, this time I'll just paint them so I don't rinse them down the drain.

<b>Katniss Arena Costume for a 9-year-old</b> - This is what my little apprentice decided she wanted to do. She came in Thursday with $30 cash (her budget) and two options: serial killer or Katniss. So we took a look at some butcher's aprons and prop knives, then looked at some Hunger Games reference photos. I showed her Vera's gorgeous Interview dress and other Katniss costumes (she was amazed! As well she should be as they are amazing.) I showed her <lj user=""amaz0n_princess"">'s family photoshoot in NC. ""She looks EXACTLY like Rue!,"" she exclaimed when she saw Gabi. She quickly settled on the Arena costume and grew more and more excited. She really wants to do the gashed up Katniss. She wanted to do the murderer because I told her how to make fake blood. She's excited to use that skill. So, I'm going to help her make a pvc bow and dowel arrows and take her thrift store shopping for the rest. Our big splurge will be a $7 Mockingjay pin from Amazon.

<b>Plants vs. Zombies Zombie (either Buckethead or Disco Zombie) for a 5-year-old</b> - Yes, this is what my son in his infinite wisdom decided he wanted to be for Halloween. So, whatever. I've got my hands full enough and this should be easy to throw together. It gets us off the hook for doing a group costume (I thought I was going to put together Adventure Time costumes for all three of us), which frees me up to make some yard decor this year perhaps.

I know, looking at the list and the calendar, you're saying, ""frees you up? Where the hell are you seeing anything freed up here?"" Compared to most Octobers, this one is pretty tame. Much more tame than September. I mean, we're actually going to get to go backpacking next week!</lj-cut>"

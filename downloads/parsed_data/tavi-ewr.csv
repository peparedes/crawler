"event","i have no clue what is going on with Him. He says it's stress from the sister and family He has to support, He says it's from work, i know His car and truck is giving Him some stress. His job stresses Him out also. 

i bought this ticket to Dallas and i am having nitemares in my head all the time that i won't get to use it. He is acting weird. He won't take my phone calls. He calls me after i am so stressed out thinking He is gone again and He thinks i should not be upset. He thinks that i have a life of roses, if He only knew what hell i go thru. He never asks me........He never asks how i am or if i am ok. Never. 

What have i done wrong? Other than being way overdue to be in Dallas. i am so scared of losing Him but i think i may have to face that reality. i don't want to live without Him. 

He does not understand that i need Him, i love Him and i want us together also. i am feeling now that i am just another thorn in His side.....

stupid thoughts go thru my mind all the time when i am like this, i want to be drunk or high.......i feel like if i was dead everyone would be better off."

Then tonite....another bump in the road. i was waiting for Him to call all nite. He went out with friends and then forgot the phone in the truck when He got home. It's 5:38 am and i am still awake and lost and confused. i am scared. 

i bought a plane ticket to Dallas yesterday. i thought everything was going to be ok. Now i am not so sure. If He can blow me off that easily......

He sounded weird when He finally did call, in a hurry to get off the phone.....that is just not like Him. i know there are so many things i don't know. It scares the hell out of me.

i was going to be in Dallas but circumstances have put that on hold. i don't know where this is going to lead. i am scared that at any moment He will change his mind again. i know there are things He does not tell me. i am not going to press these issues. 

All i can do is to walk on the eggshells, listen with my heart, hold on by a thread. i just pray that things will work themselves out. i love Him with all of my heart, will it ever be enough?"

He calls it ""come to God time"", and it has arrived. i will be in Dallas by the end of this month. i am not sure where it will lead us or what may happen.......or if it is too late or not......but i will be there. i just pray that it's not too late, i pray that He has not lost His love for me....i pray that i have not destroyed everything we started.

"event","i go thru periods of doing this journal. Sometimes it's with His insistence and sometimes it's a need of my own. He wants this journal, to see what i am thinking. i sometimes wonder what He is thinking, where His head is and how He is feeling. Maybe it's not the right of the girl to know these things of her Master...but i would still like to know. i find myself telling Him every detail of my whole day, family, work, thoughts, feelings....funny things that happens or even sad things that happens. Sometimes i feel He isn't really interested but on other days i feel He is. i would like to know more about Him. i would like to know how He is feeling. What He needs. i have always had insecurities that i may not be enough for Him. We have some different beliefs and i know that He craves to talk to people that do have His beliefs.  i have tried so hard to be open minded at times with Him. i fell in love with Him knowing these differences. i have a lot of confused thoughts going on in my head and i thought that maybe coming here today and writing would help but i don't really think it is. When 2 people make a commitment to each other....does one person have the right to know what the other is doing? In our case it's harder to know. We both agree that we love each other but we have always loved each other and both have faltered in our commitment to the other. We always survive. We find each other again and it grows stronger. 

i just don't want to go thru these periods of faltering anymore. i just want us to be strong, i want us to be together, i want us to laugh, talk, share each other's day. i want us to be able to say ""hey i had lunch with johndoe today and he said his wife was pregnant"". i want us to share..... i don't care if He knows who i am talking about and i don't care that i don't know who He is talking about. i just want to share and be in each other's lives. i am struggling here. i can't make what is in my head come out of my fingertips on this computer. Nothing make sense. The only thing that makes sense is that i love Him, i need Him.......and i am begging to be the one He can share with.

i'm just plain scared. Not of Him, not of the life we will have. i am scared i am not going to get that life. Something or someone is going to interfere before i get it. Of course it will be all my own fault. i feel like Murphy....anything that can go wrong will go wrong and it's all my fault. No matter what it is or who does what......it is all my fault. i admit it. i accept it and i own it. The fault lies within me."

The dr's told us last fall that he wouldn't live to see new years....but he did. i am glad he did. Then i catch myself thinking why can't he just go ahead and go? i feel so guilty. Should i just take off and start a new life not knowing when or if i will ever see my dad again? Or should i wait....and be here for him when he goes? i have always been the ""good girl"" .... doing what i am told. Pleasing others and making sure everyone is happy....when is it my turn? 

On the other hand....i have made Him wait. i have been selfish...i am sure He could have found some other girl who deserves Him. i love Him....i need Him....but maybe it's time to make Him happy....... one way or another."

"event","i love Him so much. We spent some quality time together last nite. Talking, whispering, loving.....we both needed it badly. 

i guess i get depressed just watching my dad slowly slip away and sometimes i feel horribly guilty that i find myself wishing it was over already. Not only for myself but for him....he is suffering. i watched my mom die a slow death.....and by the time she died it was like a relief. It's going the same for dad....i don't know why...."

"event","i went back to work after 2 weeks this weekend and i had trouble finding time to do my journal. Actually i like doing my journal. i like doing it for me because it makes me think back about my day and i am also doing something to please Him. 

i kept my nephew today, the babysitter had the day off and so did i....

i think that He sounds a bit depressed. i guess i am not doing a very good job lately of expressing how i feel about Him. i miss Him so much. i love Him.....more than i even know myself. Maybe He is just tired and trying to get used this new schedule...i hope that is all it is."

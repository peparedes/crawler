hah! for anyone who knows me thats obviously a joke.

i stand at school with the people i want to be with and listen to them talk. no words come out....i am completely blank. i want to say something but all i can do is smile like i know whats going on and what people are talking about.I make myself feel lefted out by not saynig anything, but i can't say anything when theres nothing to say. i want totalk more and im gonig to make an effort to. nothing new to me people have said ""luke you dont talk enough"" and its true. everyone stands in a group and talks and i dont know what about sometimes. maybe its not always so much i never talk but i dont get talked to. Or i just plain have nothing to say. either way my mouth is shut like a vault and its ahrd for me to be really talkative.for anyone who thinks maybe i dont talk to you because i dont like you.....its not true im jsut to shy to say hi.

Hey people
I want to start off by saying....when someone says ""he/she is perfect"" or asks if you are prefect. I would immediatly think ""NO""!. Sorry if I offend anyone who thinks otherwise but personally I think you have to have a big ego to think you are perfect. Geoff smittens mom could tell you otherwise because he is a sweet little angel. I'm not a big fan of geofs mom how she tinks hes so ""prefect"". So... as much of an angel geoff is they need to fall uot of the sky.
Back t o journal life.
Today was boring in science me and tyler pretended to be gangsters. Math was shit because i got moved, and I'm thinking im not the only one that talks.But according to my math teacher im also a loser along wit the rest of the people. As a loser I can get pushed around and tossed liek a bag of oranges.mmmm oranges. Lunch was actualyl decently fun because there was liek a mass orgy of people on the stage just foolnig around. I was a witness of an assault. I watch ariel and Clare beat on sandy.good stuff lol. After lunch i had careers and i thoguht we were in the library so i was gonig to hang out wit halec and clare there but we didnt get to go down. After school i walked home.later that night my mom turned into a bitchasouraus again.Getting mad at anything that went in her way. She threatened to take my sweater away but i wouldnt let her.

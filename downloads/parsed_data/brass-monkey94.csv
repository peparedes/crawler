"event","This is so much better than high school! Ok..sorry. Freshman moment. I just love being here. So far, everything is going exactly how I wanted it to for college. I'm studying what I want to... I'm a complete computer nerd so I'm doing Information Assurance and Security Engineering. Even in the introductory classes I'm learning so much. When I get bored or restless I can walk or take the el to places that truly interest me rather than just pass time. Also I'm not getting stuck in the some of the same ruts that my friends are. They are so into partying already that they just kind of skip their homework or don't go to class. Here I can party when I feel like it but there are also other things that I can do. Either way, its not a big deal. Someone is always willing to go with you. Even the people that stayed home are kind of getting stuck too. The Hartford/Hubertus area has a way of doing that to people. People have such big plans for themselves but something happens and they don't leave right away. The next thing they know, they end up buying a house right down the street from their parents. No lie...its kind of sad. Right now my friend is wrapped up in this whole deal that basically started because someone that likes to exaggerate couldn't keep a secret. Small town ""news"" is definitely one thing that I DO NOT miss. Ugh. I'm really starting to feel like Chicago is truly becoming home. I've only been here for a few weeks! It's crazy..."

"event","Today has just been one of those days that I should have just stayed in bed. It has been a strange day overall actually. I woke up late, took a really long shower, ate breakfast (not something I do very often), and was still early for the ""L"" down to the Loop for my first class. Both of my classes went well and we began to get into the stuff we will be learning about. That was decently exciting. From there I left for my home at Seton. Couldn't wait to get back, although I really have no idea why. Maybe it was just the fact that my bed currently lives there. About 15 minutes after I got back my roommate ran into the room and asked if I had any pirate-like clothes. Of course, like any other person I was kind of intrigued. Eventually I got her to tell me that there was going to be a pirate parade at Wicker Park. My bed was still calling so I dismissed the idea initially. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that it might be fun and a good chance to meet more people. I then proceeded to run to my closet and throw things around until I found something that could be remotely considered pirate-like. So eventually we got off the bus near Wicker Park. We saw these two guys that also looked at pirates so we figured that we would ask them where the parade was. These two guys actually happened to be the ""coordinators"" of the ""parade."" They said that two more people would be joining us and the parade was in fact at and in (in as in stopping traffic without a permit) the intersection that we were currently standing at. In all actuality, the parade was supposed to be a demonstration of sorts and the pirates were supposed to be revolutionaries. The connection, however, between pirates and revolutionaries still escapes me. Revolutionaries stand for something and pirates mostly just steal things. Here's a part of the flyer that they were handing out so you can get an idea of how messed up this whole thing actually was. 
     ""You can't fight city hall. Death and taxes. Don't talk about politics or religion. This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line. Lay down. G.I. lay down. G.I. We saw it all through the 20th century. And now in the 21st century. It's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze. We should not submit to dehumanization. I don't know about you. But I'm concerned with what's happening in this world. I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the systems of control. Those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more! I want freedom! That's what I want! And that's what you should want!""
     From there it continues with themes of greed, hatred, envy, and insecurity. Again, these are NOT my views but those of the people that organized it. My roommate just came back now and said that the ""organizer"" got arrested. How fun. Today has been strange indeed..."

"event","So far Discover has been a pretty good experience for me. I'm learning where stuff is, which is good cause I have almost no sense of direction. The sense works better in the city than in the country though. Kind of strange considering I'm from the country. Anyway, I'm also learning about lots of different stuff to do and I'm making friends along the way. That's really good cause I only sort of know one other person here but I don't think I ever see her. Not entirely too sure about that cause I'm not sure I'd recognize her. 

I had lots of fun at the art museum cause I rarely have the opportunity to do stuff like that at home. The only thing that disappointed me there was the fact that American Gothic grew legs and moved to Iowa of all places. Overall day two was an interesting day. It did get kind of long though, especially during the Hemingway part. I enjoy learning about the background behind writers, especially interesting ones, but after doing so much already in addition to all of the strain of moving to college I felt myself drifting away at times. Anyway, this one is for Kaitlyn!!!

Before today I never really knew all that much about Jane Addams. I knew that she was a strong advocate for peace and that she founded the Hull House and stuff but I really didn't know anything about her background or anything so I found all of that information pretty interesting. Seeing and actually being in Hull House was kind of inspiring too. I have been on four different mission trips with my church and it was just so inspiring to see that just a handful of people can make such a difference in the lives of so many people. 

I hope that tomorrow will be as or more interesting than everything we've done up until now!

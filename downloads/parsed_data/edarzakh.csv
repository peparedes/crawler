Just a note for the USAians: Mrs Hudson is played by Una Stubbs, who played the daughter in the British series Till Death Do Us Part, which was the inspiration for All in the Family, where the daughter was played by Sally Struthers.

Oh, and I figured it was Mycroft as soon as I saw him. I loved the original books. Now we just await the arrival of Moriarty."

I had my mum come up at the end of last month to stay for a week, which was quite nice untill she started rearranging my life. It was a good rest for her, and what was scary is she got to see some TV she would never have seen because it's on too late. Like Nurse Jackie. And she loved it. But I don't think she'll see it back home. We watched some movies - my collection isn't really ""mother friendly"", but we found a few she watched more than she snored through.

I'm all booked for my holiday so I'll be away for just over two weeks at the end of the year. Just don't take that as a reason to come and steal all my stuff, 'kay.

As far as work is concerned, I really don't know what's going on. There's work, but not chargeable, so they're reluctant to spend money on anything the client will pay for, and of course our clients are hit by slow-buying customers too. However in general, the economy is floating just above water, so we'll probably get through it with a few sacrifices.

One thing I have been noticing is something I call <i>Disassociation</i>, where people have lost the ability to connect in p2p conversation; they prefer staring at a monitor, checking their cell, and in general avoiding anything that requires more than five minutes to resolve an issue. For instance, I had missed the staff meeting, so I had the following exchange with A:
Me: Did anything come up I need to know about?
A: It was the shortest meeting ever. (grin)
Me: Huh? What was discussed?
A: Ne news is good news.
Me: Hey that's not the answer to the question. What news?
A: (starts to back away - we'd reached the 5 minute zone) Uh, couple of good prospects, customer ready to upgrade... (etc etc but definitely what I'd call new)
Me: Thanks. That's all I needed to know the first time.

Argh!

Yeah. Bad I know. It's 2009 and March and I'm finally getting around to posting. There are some reasons, but they're so damn pathetic I won't list them.

<STRONG>Holiday</STRONG>
I went South for Christmas/New Year - another quiet one, but I managed to bully my brother into giving me some more time, which involved him paying for dinner so the two of us could have a talk, which wasn't nearly enough. And his son was in town (over from Oz) so I caught up with him as well. 
Christmas Day was at my uncle's, as he had his daughter and grandson there from Oz for the duration. I took a rather crappy vidoe on my cellphone, and posted it to <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH7HN-x1r6Y"">YouTube</A>. It's my mum chattering away mostly.

<STRONG>January and February Went So FAST!
</STRONG>It's mainly been work and stuff for the last 2 months, but I did have some ghosts from past pop up. The first was an email at work from B who managed to track me down. I'd consider her to be the mother of BBSing in Auckland, as she set up a BBS in the 80's, and had BBQs at her place, and many of the people who attended went on to be very prominent in the internet industry, such as setting up ISPs, blogging and more. She is also resonsible for introducing me to a crazy game called Pyroto, but that's another story entirely. She's an amazing lady, in her 60's and working as Administrator on the linux network at the local university. Her husband, of course, has retired. I've been to their place for dinner a couple of times and had great conversations about everything from computers to movies to science fiction.

The other ghost was G, who ""drunk dialled"" me one night, and I had to get him to identify himself. I first met him when he was about 18 at a RP group, and introduced him to computer programming (BASIC) and the pernicious weed. He got married and drifted down south, and we lost touch until he got drunk one night, almost 30 years later. He's been earning $100/hr at contract programming, and appears to have a harem of Thai ladies, both in NZ and in Thailand. He's an interesting character (my mum says I tend to attract ""weirdos"") but with enough common interests to be good conversation.

<STRONG>Books and Movies</STRONG>
I was recommended by J in Sydney to read Old Man's War by John Scalzi, so I managed to track it down, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's <EM>hard</EM> sf but with some clever science and characters you get to like. So I bought the second in the series, Ghost Brigades , which I finished, and am now looking for the third, The Last Colony, which I'll probably have to order from overseas.
And I've just finished reading Watchmen (I forst read it about 20 years ago) in preparation for the movie. I'm really looking forward to seeing that, and I'm totally prepared to accept it to miss out a lot of the greatness that was the original.

There's a few more things yet to post, but I'll leave those for later. Maybe pictures, once I work out how to use Photobucket again.

Happy New Year!"

<STRONG>Visit of the Parent</STRONG>

<STRONG>Ma Stay
</STRONG>
There have been a few highlights, but the standout one was my mum actually braving a passage by silver bird, and staying with me for a week over Easter. Despite her age, she is far too busy, and I always offer her a chance to get away from it and come up here and stay while I drive her around, cook the meals, and allow her to sit back and read and wind down until she gets fed up with me.

It works fine for both of us. She doesn't like walking too far, so she doesn't go shopping or sightseeing, but she did get a chance to see my new car, and visit some old friends. I took a day off work but didn't really need to. It's interesting that our conversation has matured a lot, and we can have a very open and easy conversation with each other. I'm glad that at this age she's still got all her marbles, and although she is confused by technology, she is also astounded by it. She's mastered cell phone texting, email, and almost surfing.

Once she got back home, she experimented with surfing a bit, and confessed she ""accidentally"" clicked on a Match Making link and ended up looking at elderly men looking to hook up with elderly women - she was quite shocked to even think there were such people!

<STRONG>Television</STRONG>

My TV time is very selective these days, and I choose my programs. Lost has just started again, and I have to thank the awesome <lj user=""killerweasel""> for pointing me at Dexter, which I love dearly for its sheer anti-ness of all that is the CSI genre. Dr Who is in repeat mode, and there is bugger all on in the way of hard sci-fi, so I'm waiting for Battlestar Galactica to return.

Movies

I seem to have watched a whole heap of movies since the last update, so I'm not reviewing them, but I'll just add some comments.
<U>AvP Requiem</U> - just a teen slasher horror abomination
<U>Death at a Funeral</U> - very funny, but not quite what I expected
<U>Hitman </U>- nice atmospheric thriller
<U>Cloverfield</U> - I loved it, but I can see how not everyone would. 
<U>National Treasure Book of Secrets</U> - unoriginal, by the numbers, Nicholas Cage as a robot
<U>Jumper</U> - just plain bad physics, and a wooden Hayden Christensen playing a bad good guy.
<U>Vantage Point</U> - this reminded me of Memento, in that its flashback technique open up the plot in a clever way.
<U>Doomsday</U> - kinda zombies with Road Warrior but being British, very dark.
<U>The Kingdom</U> - an interesting, insightful look at terrorism that allows you to see the other side. I liked it.
<U>Ratatouille</U> - somewhat predictable, but a great ride and very clever 3D animation.

<STRONG>Visits</STRONG>

I had S come over for a weekend to help get some shelving set up, but the Saturday we were supoosed to do that, I got called in to work to fix a program, so he went back home. The only productivething was that I fixed it in a couple of hours.

I went to Y's a couple of Fridays ago, picked up a bunch of movies and played Supreme Commander until the early hours. And didn't get to bed until about 7am. At least that sort of behaviour doesn't happen very often. His wife has just had another baby (her 4th, his 6th) and he makes me both envious of his great kids, and grateful I don't have a life as complicated.

<STRONG>Whatever Else</STRONG>

I'm sure there's a bunch of other crap I could share with you, like getting a security system and new stereo for the car, and putting up with work and stuff, but I think that'll do it. So I'll just leave you with <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WfE3493ENc"">this</A>."

"event","I'm back! Two weeks of holiday away from the big city, enduring the agony of dial-up, and now I've been back for a week, so I thought I'd better do the update thingy.

<b>Beforemath</b>
The other programmer, R, was away on holiday overseas in the week leading up, so I had a bit more work to do than usual. Which fitted in with my bathroom being modified into a full wet shower, which did away with the bath, giving me a lot more space and making it look much nicer. I spent 5 days in a motel while it was being done, and managed to get to work earlier than normal. Whatever that is for me, anyway.

<b>Holiday</b>
Nelson is a great little place, but kinda small and slow, and without my own transport down there, it usually gets a bit boring. However it did end up being a ""gathering of the clan"", so there were visits from relatives and various friends passing through on their way to holiday destinations.

Mum's 80th went off okay, but the restaurant was a disappointment - overpriced for the quality, and not easy to circulate. However it was quiet and reasonably private, and it was good that mum's granddaughter was able to be there.

Here's a group shot of most of the family gathered at mum's:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v105/edarzakh/LiveJournal/Christmas2007Family.jpg"" title=""""  alt=""Christmas 2007"">

Top row, left to right: Bro, son of cuz2 and cuz2, cuz1. Bottom: Uncle (81!), Mum, cuz1's wife, cuz1's daughter, fat bugger.

Mum cooked Christmas dinner (for the <b>last</b> time, she said - again) and nothing really interesting in the way of presents. My brother didn't turn up as it was his step-daughter's birthday as well, so they we having a big family thing, and it would have been chaos for mum with a bunch of kids. We dropped round at his place for his birthday the day after, and had a pleasant time sitting outside getting fried in the sun.

Saw <u>The Golden Compass</u> at the movies - not bad for special effects but a bit rushed with the plot and you really had to concentrate to follow it.

Went to a restaurant called LoneStar for one of the biggest meals I've ever had - 350gm steak and loads of fries and coleslaw.

<b>Aftermath</b>
I went to work the day after I got back just to prepare myself, but there isn't much on at the moment so I took it easy. That continued for the weekend while I caught up on all the internetty stuff, much liking the return to broadband. Went over to Y's on Monday for an excellent curry cooked by hi smother and to meet his father over from Australia, and then played computer games until after 2am. Which meant I didn't really feel much like going to work on Tuesday.

I think I'm almost back to normal now..."

<STRONG>The Zoo
</STRONG>Some time ago, I did a very small bit of programming for a client I had inherited, who was running a very very old program that should not have been still using, however it printed member labels for her, and she wasn't interested in using anything else. So she kept in touch, and occasionally got me to apply bandaids. For the last few years I've just done them and asked her to make a donation to a charity of her choice. Anyway, for the last job she sent me a family pass to the <A href=""http://www.aucklandzoo.co.nz/"">Auckland Zoo</A>. Since I don't have a tribe, I gave it to my friend Y, who does. He suggested I go with them. Since I hadn't been for several decades that sounded good to me. Getting him and his tribe organised was another matter, and it took a few weeks before it all came together, and even then we started too late. It was still fun, as the zoo is very well laid out. Most of the animals weren't interested in displaying themselves, or were asleep, but we did see the lions, a few monkeys, zebras, a giraffe, ostrich, cassowary, elephants, a kiwi, tuataras, a very comatose alligator and various birds, insects, reptiles etc. I went back to their place, and had fish and chips, and played computer games for a while. It was a pleasant afternoon with a family who kinda regard me as their uncle.

<STRONG>Movies</STRONG>
I've watched a few of these in the last few weeks, but I can't really recommend many. 
<U>1408</U> A horror movie with a difference and a few twists. John Cusack makes it worth seeing.
<U>Hatchet</U> An amazingly gory movie that uses the device of inventing novel ways of slicing and dicing.
<U>Rush Hour 3</U> Don't bother if you've seen the others. It's a by-the-number replay.
<U>Skin Walkers</U> A werewolf movie - slightly different and minimal special effects but still werewolves
<U>WAR</U> Jason Statham and Jet Li - an interesting combo and lots of action.
<U>The Condemned</U> A bunch of death row inmates and Stone Cold Steve Austin let loose on an island - you know who the last one left standing will be.
<U>The Reaping</U> I never really figured out what this was trying to get across. Some sort of religious apocalyptic old testament ""The End is Nigh"" babble. Nothing very scary, and if it doesn't make you look at what faith is, then it will be forgettable.
<U>Disturbia</U> Worth watching just to see how similar (and how different) to The Rear Window it is.

I think I watched a couple more, but if I list anymore you'll probably think that's all I do.

<STRONG>Stereo</STRONG>
Since my last stereo got stolen last year, I've been using my old one, where the tape deck doesn't work, it only plays one CD at a time, and the tuner is starting to die. So I priced a new one that had MP3, audio and USB input at $289 then just happened to see it in a clearance warehouse for $198. So always one to save money by spending it, I got it. It's not a massive home theatre, but it has a 5CD stack, and sounds nice. It's a keeper, so long as the scum don't go shopping for it.

<STRONG>Car</STRONG>
I finally picked it up today! Yay! It's a little beauty, and despite being 7 years old, is in near perfect condition and drives like a dream. It's so much easier to drive around knowing it has the power to get in and out of traffic. I'll have to put a decent stereo in it, as it's just the factor install, which doesn't get most local FM frequencies. However that will come after I pay insurance, and possibly get an alarm system installed. <A href=""http://www.finda.co.nz/classifieds/vehicle/listing/4j11kp/honda-integra-2000/"">This</A> is the model, but mine is <STRONG>BLACK</STRONG>!

I've booked my tickets back to the homeland, so I'll be without broadband after about December 17th for two weeks. I consider it a detox. My mum's 80th birthday, and her grandkids will both be over. It will be unmissable.

So, until the time/space continuum warps again, I'm outta here."

<STRONG>Winter Dies! Hah!
</STRONG>It's getting warmer. Yay! And I've even spotted some blue stuff up there in the grey. It's just been drizzly, mizzly crap for what seems like months. And I have no clothes drier.

<STRONG>No News is... what?</STRONG>
Not a huge amount to update on, as I've forgotten all the exciting stuff. The new car may be on the way, as I've been allocated a certain amount to spend, and I just have to go and look (again!) for a suitable one. Maybe I'll just call up the cate sales place and get them to find one for me. They need to earn their commission. My current vehicle is slowly dying still, making weird noises and using far too much gas.

<STRONG>Flickeries</STRONG>
I've been catching up on movies, so here's a list:
<U>Mr Bean's Holiday</U> - typical Bean, with the usual funny faces, and a cute clever ending. It's drawn out, but worth waiting for the gags.
<U>Norbit</U> - total crap. I forced myself to watch it in case there was a trick ending, but it was predictable, annoying and just not funny. Eddie Murphy likes dressing up in fat lady suits. Nuff sed.
<U>The Pursuit of Happyness</U> - very uplifting and well done. It was good to see Will Smith do a movie he seemed to really believe in for a change. Sometimes you wonder if the guy didn't just give up his dream, as all sorts of shit got thrown at him.
<U>Barnyard</U> - guy cows with tits. Yeah. That was supposed to be funny. Everything else was downhill.
<U>Bridge to Terabithea</U> - really touching kids story, with some sad places, but absolutely delightful with a clever integration of reality and fantasy.
<U>Pan's Labyrinth</U> - definitely not a kids story. Tragic and scary in parts, and more of a socio-political commentary than a fantasy. The special effects were amazing, but really it was an allegory.
<U>Surf's Up</U> - recommended highly for a good enjoyable chuckle. Penguin surfer dudes, and so much better done than Happy Feet. More for the older folk like me.
<U>Die Hard 4.0</U> - totally mindless unbelievable violent geriatric Bruce Willis on steroids insanity, and a shit-kickingly enjoyable ride. Watch it and forget it.

</STRONG>Just gimme a bell... Everyone has been shuffling around this last week, taking days off calling in sick. So I get a dribbly snout, stuffed-up sinuses, and now it's working its way into my innards. ""Just a cold"" I keep saying. Of course, the weather is crap - drizzly cold rain still, and little chance of sitting in the sun for a while. Of course, it's winter.

<STRONG>Movies</STRONG>
With nothing much else to do, I managed to see some movies.
<U>Dead Silence</U> - Ventriloquist dummies. Killer dummies. What else can I see. Nice production values, reasonable acting, but it was just another ""dead person makes more dead people"" plot.
<U>Surf's Up</U> - now this was fun. They could have done it with otters, which are way cuter, but since penguins are oh so fashionable right now, it had to be penguins. Some suggestion of inter-species ""get it on"" and the usual fuzzy kids cracking fart jokes - I still laughed.

Work might have resolved itself. I admitted I was kinda grumpy, especially that a major project I had been responsible for over a year ago got pushed back <EM>yet again</EM> to a later release, and some work is starting to trickle in. I still get R standing over me to show how he does stuff his way, but I deal with it.

No word on a car yet, apart from paper shuffling I need to get done first. In the meantime, my current one seems to know its due to be retired, and it's making ""old man"" noises. I have to ignore them.

<STRONG>Ride in my car, car?
</STRONG>I desperately need a new car. My current one has lasted me for 15 years, but it's rotting away, and to get it fixed will cost more than it's worth. However I depend on a bureaucratic government agency for the funds, and for that I have to jump through flaming hoops and fetch sticks. I've seen exactly the car I want, but it is apparently too old for their criteria. Godammit, I don't <STRONG>care</STRONG>! And my licence has expired so I have to go and run that down as well before they'll give me another ladder to run up.

<STRONG>Work</STRONG>
I've mentioned before that my co-programmer R pisses me off sometimes. He likes to do things his way, and feels better if everyone else does it too. So instead of teaching me how to do something, he needs to use my keyboard and do it for me, and then I don't learn. And I have to ask him again.

So I have a problem with a program and ask his advice. Instead of talking it over, he grabs the keyboard and starts rewriting the program. There was nothing wrong with it! It turns out there is a weirdness with the language that caused the problem, and he remembered after he appeared to insist it was something wrong I had done. After changing syntax, formatting my code his way, etc etc. Blah.

So then I come in today and find my development environment has been changed. We use slightly different setups, and there is no reason for him to make mine the same as his, except we had discussed it, and I said I was prepared to use the same base setup as him so if anything was changed it would affect both of us, rather than having to change our setups individually. Ah, so instead hes' just replaced my commands with his, without saying so. I spent over an hour making them all work again. Crap! I sent him an email anyway, just to let him know. He was off sick today, so hopefully he gets better.

I just turned all the bloody heaters on and ignored potential global incandescence for a while. It's actually not too bad if the icebergs aren't circling the archipelago like wagons, but the South Island is sure getting hit hard.

<STRONG>A Plethora of Geekin's</STRONG>
My employment came through with a nice bonus. I squandered it on a new system that (hopefully) will play all the new games I won't be able to afford. I did pick up Supreme Commander for half retail price, and love it - it just takes too long to play a game. Argh!

<STRONG>Movies
</STRONG><U>Idiocracy</U> - watch it! It's a horror story about the present. The ending is a bit too cutesy but all you smart people need to get to having samrt young 'uns or the world is doomed to hell in a trailer park.
<U>Fantastic 4 II</U> - great fun, in a tragic kind of way Tragic in that I will never see Jessica Alba as hot as she was in the movie.

Okay that's enough. Just thought I'd better catch up as the computer with Semagic installed on it doesn't seem to be making loud noises any more."

You know those packets you put in the microwave for 3 minutes and turn into a big-arse bag of popcorn? Well, I've just eaten a whole one of those. I may regret it. But it was so addictive, and helped me watch Men in Black II all the way through for the 97th time. About.

<b>Bionic Granny</b>

My mum had a hip replacement a month ago. She's been in  massive pain for over a year, taking painkillers just to make it through the day. So they booked her in for the million-dollar joint job with three weeks notice. She came through fine. Now she's just climbing the walls becasue she can't drive the car for a couple of weeks. However I bet she sneaks one before the time is up. She's already walking round the block with a crutch and an attitude. Unstoppable! The best thing is - no pain. Cool.

<b>Time keeps on...</b>

Another weekend. We're out of daylight saving now, so the evenings get dark quicker, although the weather is still moderately warm. I'm finding it quite good working later once everyone as gone home, as I can get more thinking done without the madness during the day. If I have a good project to work on, it's even better, as I don't have to pester anyone.

In the meantime, here's some links I found with StumbleUpon:

<i><p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1""><strong>What   Is Intelligence, Anyway?</strong><br>  <strong>Isaac Asimov</strong><br>  </font></p><blockquote>  <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"">What is intelligence,     anyway? When I was in the army, I received the kind of aptitude test that     all soldiers took and, against a normal of 100, scored 160. No one at the     base had ever seen a figure like that, and for two hours they made a big fuss     over me. (It didn't mean anything. The next day I was still a buck private     with KP - kitchen police - as my highest duty.)<br>    </font></p>  <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"">All my life I've     been registering scores like that, so that I have the complacent feeling that     I'm highly intelligent, and I expect other people to think so too. Actually,     though, don't such scores simply mean that I am very good at answering the     type of academic questions that are considered worthy of answers by people     who make up the intelligence tests - people with intellectual bents similar     to mine?<br>    </font></p>  <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"">For instance,     I had an auto-repair man once, who, on these intelligence tests, could not     possibly have scored more than 80, by my estimate. I always took it for granted     that I was far more intelligent than he was. Yet, when anything went wrong     with my car I hastened to him with it, watched him anxiously as he explored     its vitals, and listened to his pronouncements as though they were divine     oracles - and he always fixed my car.<br>    </font></p>  <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"">Well, then, suppose     my auto-repair man devised questions for an intelligence test. Or suppose     a carpenter did, or a farmer, or, indeed, almost anyone but an academician.     By every one of those tests, I'd prove myself a moron, and I'd be a moron,     too. In a world where I could not use my academic training and my verbal talents     but had to do something intricate or hard, working with my hands, I would     do poorly. My intelligence, then, is not absolute but is a function of the     society I live in and of the fact that a small subsection of that society     has managed to foist itself on the rest as an arbiter of such matters.<br>    </font></p>  <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"">Consider my auto-repair     man, again. He had a habit of telling me jokes whenever he saw me. One time     he raised his head from under the automobile hood to say: ""Doc, a deaf-and-mute     guy went into a hardware store to ask for some nails. He put two fingers together     on the counter and made hammering motions with the other hand. The clerk brought     him a hammer. He shook his head and pointed to the two fingers he was hammering.     The clerk brought him nails. He picked out the sizes he wanted, and left.     Well, doc, the next guy who came in was a blind man. He wanted scissors. How     do you suppose he asked for them?""<br>    </font></p>  <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"">Indulgently,     I lifted by right hand and made scissoring motions with my first two fingers.     Whereupon my auto-repair man laughed raucously and said, ""Why, you dumb     jerk, He used his voice and asked for them."" Then he said smugly, ""I've     been trying that on all my customers today."" ""Did you catch many?""     I asked. ""Quite a few,"" he said, ""but I knew for sure I'd catch     you."" ""Why is that?"" I asked. ""Because you're so goddamned     educated, doc, I knew you couldn't be very smart.""<br>    </font></p>  <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"">And I have an     uneasy feeling he had something there.</font> </p></blockquote></i>"

"event","<b>Heritage</b>
We've just had a national holiday here. Called Waitangi Day, which marks the day in 1840 when maori and european signed a treaty to declare they were one people, in one country. It's interesting to note that maori for treaty is <i>tiriti</i> - a phonetic translastion. Which means maori didn't have a word for treaty - or a contract which represented an agreement between two or more parties.

Now there are groups carrying banners today asking is to ""honour the treaty"". I wonder what they are asking.

So today, although I intended to go out somewhere, I stayed home, cleaned the car windows, and made a concerted attack on the book I'm reading, The Broker, by John Grisham. It's not my usual book. My niece gave it to me for Christmas, and so far it's an addictive read, in that I'm involved with the main character.

<b>Milestones</b>
It was my birthday on Sunday. I'm now at that age where it doesn't require ceremony. I had a few phone calls, but mainly spent it quietly pottering about. At work on Monday they'd rigged my speakers up so they played Happy Birthday when I got to my desk. And the boss's wife made a cake. So there was some degree of ritual about it.

<b>Movies I've watched</b>
<u>Snakes on a Plane</u> - totally predictable and monochrome acting, but a blast nevertheless.
<u>Little Miss Sunshine</u> - one of those quirky little character comedies, and you know what's going to happen, but you have fun getting there.
<u>Chaos</u> - Wesley Snipes as a bad guy - yet another bank robbery thriller, lots of action and twists, total fluff.
<u>Terrorstorm</u> and <u>Loose Change</u> - the 911 conspiracy movies. Terrorstorm is crap and far too hyped to be believed, whereas Loose Change is well put together, and although is one-sided, asks a number of very interesting questions, without answering them.
<u>Monster House</u> - it's CGI animated and looks like it should be a kids movie, but somehow it's stuck in between genres. Some very well done MoCap. It's just a standard ghost story that's been done before."

"event","While I was down south, I discovered some of my old English essays and exercise books. I remember English in my teens as a labour, where the teachers didn't appreciate originality, but preferred the ""party line"" - to know and appreciate the classics as they did. So I did, and discovered that even Shakespeare, Bacon, Asimov and Tolkien would have had to have been original at some stage, and through that, became known.

I wrote weird, anarchistic prose which received low marks and disparaging comments. As a result, I veered into science, and avoided the ""mundane morass"" of the arts.

I discovered this link with StumbleUpon, and wept a little for my forgotten future.

"event","I've been back for almost a week now, so I thought I'd better register my emergence back into the vUniverse. Almost 3 weeks on a diet of dialup teaches a few basic truths about dependence. It's possible, but not desirable. Like giving up smoking. Which I tried to persuade my brother and his wife to do, with the realisation that no amount of persuasion is going to make any difference until they find they really have to.

So it was a good break. Spent a lot of time talking to mum, as I didn't have my own transport. Town is close enough to get there without driving, and the weather stayed fine the first weak so I got the major shopping done.

Christmas day was quiet - we decided not to do the community mayor's dinner again, so it was just the two of us. L took her neighbour to it though, and enjoyed herself. She wasn't really able to see much of me as she had messed her shoulder up, and was limiting driving. However she shouted me Casino Royale (very good fun) and dinner at one of the most expensive restaurants in town, a very good Japanese one.

I even got to see more of my brother this time, as they came over for evening dinner on New Years day, and spent several hours. And then my neice came over from Perth and I saw her a couple of times as well. She's not too happy with the limited attention her dad is giving her, but I suspect there's more to that than the parties involved are telling.

The weather went to crap for the last week, so I didn't go any distance, but I was happy just lying around, staying away from computers apart from teaching mum how to do email, and reading.

Here's a pic from my phone cam of the centre of the town from about 5 minute's walk away, across the river:

<b>Desk Pad</b>
I'm a frustrated artist, so ever since I've had a clean white pad of paper on my work desk, it has sooner or layter become covered with artwork. Not just doodles, but drawings, ideas for sketches, attempts at drawing stuff from memory, cartoons. There's someone somewhere who I gave a whole bunch to, and I have no idea where they are now.

At my current job when I've filled the pad up, I give it to the boss to take home to his kids to have a laugh at. I rescued the latest one so I could rip some scans off it. About half of the pad is just numbers, notes and jottings. The rest is just random mind-poo. Here's one example of what I come up with when I should be working:

"event","It's been an interesting, and slightly busier than usual, couple of months. I just haven't felt motivated to update the journal, and then the things I wanted to post just got backlogged. So there'll be a batch of these, and initially rather out of date.

<b>Cousins from the Past</b> 
Quite a few years ago, when I was about 10, one of my uncles moved to Australia, taking his two daughters and son with them. The daughters were older than me and the son was younger. We got on, in a cousin-ly way, and because the kids established themselves in Oz with families and such, they rarely made it back to the mother islands. So I didn't see them for many years, and then it was the daughters when I went to Australia, and one came to NZ.

The son, D, made it to NZ a couple of times but our paths never intersected, although he got to see my parents and brother. So when he said he was stopping by in Auckland airport on the way to Niue, I made every effort to see him there. Although it was only for an hour or so, we had a great conversation, and since he is involved with geophysics (he was on his way to Niue to install tremor detecting devices) we talked scientific stuff, computers, and what was wrong with the rest of the cousins. As we do. I probably won't see him for another decade or two, but it was a good affirmation of family ties.

A week later the son and daughter of my other uncle were returning through Auckland after their father's 80th birthday, and I was hoping to catch up with them as well. However I wasn't told the departure time and missed them by about 10 minutes. I've seen them more often than D so it wasn't a huge loss, and they come to NZ sometimes anyway. I'm running out of family members fast, so I thinks it's real important to keep contact.

<b>Me</b>
I went to company Christmas dinner a couple of weeks ago, which I'll write about later. Some photos were taken, and the one of me made me look particularly jovial (only one wine and a beer, 'kay?) so I thought I'd post it here.

Couple of movies to recommend: <b>16 Blocks</b> with Bruce Willis - like Die Hard 3 but with a few twists. Rather mundane but worth a watch. He's getting old and he didn't run and shoot as much.

<b>Nanny McPhee</b>
Mary Poppins it ain't! Cleverly done, and kinda sweet at the end. If only some real-life nannies had powers like that. If you like predictably happy endings, this'll do.

<b>The Brothers Grimm</b>
It's a Gilliam, so it had his touches, but less wacky than usual. A very interesting amalgam of fairy tales where they are more related to the original versions than the Disney ones. Darkish (isn't that just Terry!) but enough romance to satisfy.

<b>Over the Hedge</b>
I might have already mentioned this one - it's a hoot.

<b>The Road To Guantanamo</b>
This is a story of what happened to a group of British friends who simply went to Pakistan for a wedding, and got caught up in the War Against Terror. It's based on reality, and if it's believable, that so-called war is just creating more terrorists.

<b>Inside Man</b>
A bank robbery beautifully planned with some nice little twists to it. Worth watching if you like thinking as you watch.

<b>Music</b>
A from work asked me if I liked blues - he knows I do as he's got a good idea of my tastes in music. He wanted to go to see a NZ blues band, Darcy Perry, and his wife doesn't like going out to such things. I jumped at it, as I don't see much live music these days. Parking was a hassle for a midweek evening, but apparently Ben Elton was on at the same time, and he's reqally popular. 
The band was awesome - a 2 hour gig, ranging from solid thudding blues to light jazzy to rock to cool vocals to reggae - an excellent selection. I was jumping up and down in my seat after the second or third number. Here's some <a href=""http://www.darcyperry.co.nz/"">more info</a>.

<b>Movies</b> I saw the shorts to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327084/"">Over The Hedge</a> a while back, and it looked like fun, being a Pixar production. I finally got my hands on a copy, and it is great - thoroughly recommended, with some wild animal characters. Very predictable plot, but the little in-jokes and characterisations really make it work as entertainment.

<b>Games</b>
Since the demise of Pyroto and then BM, I haven't really found another on-line game like them, so it looks like we have to roll our own these days. So there's yet another one in development at the moment, and it's at the stage of looking for players to try it out, make recommendations/suggestions etc. It's kinda raw and buggy, like a feral possum, but we'd like to know where to take it from here, and if there's any interest still.
If you're prepared to make constructive contributions to get it underway, leave a comment, or send me an email (address in my profile, I hope).

<b>Blokarting</b>
The company social club had a bit of money to spread around, so about eight of use went out to a park to try out driving round in three-wheel carts with sails. <a href=""http://www.blownaway.co.nz/"">Here's the website</a>. C had already driven one, but the rest of us were complete noobs. It was surprisingly easy to pick up, and some even dared to try out the larger sails, which meant <i>more speed..</i>.

Apart from that, it's been a reasonably quiet month. So far."

But she made it, depsite her misgivings about travelling. She was here for a week, and I had given her strict orders to take a break from her usual activities of cooking and cleaning. I did all the meals at home bar one, when she did a corned beef and cabbage dinner for me (I don't do those) and we went out for dinner, her shout.

She went and stayed with an old school friend for a coupel of nights, which gave me a chance to catch up on my late nights/late mornings.

On my part, the whole aim was to get her away from her mad social life, and just sit and rest for a week. Which is what I always do when I stay with her. By all accounts, mission was accomplished.

My brother picked her up from the airport, but she hasn't seen him since. His comment when he met her: ""Where are all the parcels?"" - I guess he expected he to have done lots of shopping and brought him back a present. Hah!

My routine is almost back to normal, although I think she threw a whole lot of stuff away that I might miss sometime later."

I discovered Google Video a while back, and spent many a happy hour letting myself be entertained by 20 second flicks - thats' about the average attention span of a goldfish, innit?

I'm suffering from a major dose of procrastinationism these days - and I'm sure it stems from a weird thing I've been noticing - that I get somewhat disturbed by change. Something that gets moved at work so I can't find it or use it, things where they shouldn't be, not knowing what's going because I wasn't there at the time. Also I find myself observing routines, like the things, and the order of doing them before I go to work. Almost like OCD, but not quite that bad, but I can see how it happens. You get used to (nay, <i>comfortable</i>) with the way things are and perform rituals to ensure they stay that way.

So when a disturbance comes about, there's a reconnection with the repetitive rituals to restore the balance.

I'm noticing this stuff, so at least that's a good sign.

I'll try new stuff out when I can. It just may involve me getting away from this screen a bit more - I feel the onset of addiction.

<b>Vinyl Ages</b>

I got a deck to allow me to play my collection of vinyl LPs a while back - actually, to feed them into the computer so I can burn them to CDs. A simple process, but rather tedious. So far I've burned a collection for the amazing <lj user=""Melinika"">, and moved a couple of discs over to plastic. If anyone would like to hear what <b>Matching Mole</b> or <i>Stomu Yamashta's</i> <b>Go</b> sounds like, just let me know and I can throw over a MP3. At the moment I'm listening to a band called <b>Greenslade</b> who I think I bought because of the cool <a href=""http://www.rogerdean.com/"">Roger Dean</a> artwork on the cover.

<b>Distractions</b>
These days I'm spending far too much time playing Day of Defeat, not that I set myself standards about such things, and I'm also getting entertained by <a href=""http://cities.totl.net/cgi-bin/game"">Four Cities</a>, whereas my interest in <a href=""http://www.kingdomofloathing.com"">Kingdom of Loathing</a> has waned, and is mainly a means of keeping track of a few of the Badde Manors/Pyroto refugees.

<b>Movies</b>
Here's bunch of recommendations - you <b>must</b> see <b>Syriana</b>, and <b>Lord of War</b>, and put the themes in context with what is going on at the moment. And think, rather than judge.

I finally got to see <b>Serenity</b> - it's even better than the Firefly series was, and as one reviewer suggested, it's got the elements of the first Star Wars movies - factor in gobs of swashbuckling.

I saw <b>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dean Man's Ches</b>t at the movies and it's a lot of fun - Johnny Depp just takes his boots off and splashes around in the role. <b>Superman Returns</b> is rather slow but makes some interesting points about the whole superhero schtick - I wouldn't get overly philosophical about it, but there's more <i>deep brooding</i> than rampant heroism in this one.

<b>Easter</b>

I went down south to the hometown, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of my grandmother's birth. In a way, it was good that she didn't make it, as she said she never wanted to be that old.

I arrived the Tuesday night, mum picking me up from the airport, and although I intended to go into town for the afternoon, I ended up giving her some computer lessons. She's determined to use it, and not getting much out of her SeniorNet course, I thought I'd better set her straight on the basics. We had some success after I reconfigured Outlook Express, and managed to send emails to each other.

Thursday we went to a restaurant called Smugglers for the birthday - it was a great feeding place, but noisy and crowded. My brother almost wasn't going to turn up as his wife was going to have her grandkids, but I think some heavy persuading was performed, and they were in attendance, albeit a bit late. Still, it was worthy of the matriarch, and she would have enjoyed herself if she'd been there.

Friday was raining, so no town trip for me, but I used it to give mum a few more lessons and spend time talking.

Saturday brother P and his wife and my friend L came out to the airport to see me off. It was a brilliant sunset flight with good views of a cloudy skyscape. I landed in Auckland and A from work picked me up and took me home."

One of the reasons (just one) for infrequent updates is that the Firefox extension, Deepest Sender, that I used for posting to LJ has borked, in that it tries and tries to post and just gives up. It seems to have happened since the server move. If anyone has a solution, you may be rewarded with more frequency.

<b>Weekends</b>

Last weekend I had S over to watch a few movies and check out his XBox, since I'd never seen one before. I found the console awkward, having been raised on the mouse/keyboard combo. But if console games advance a generation or two, I could be enticed.

He watched Zathura - I'd already seen it but it was still worth another glance. Very much a kids movie, so he borrowed it to show his nephews.

Then we went out on the Sunday to see <i>V for Vendetta</i> - a rather clever take on the Guy Fawkes legend, and somewhat contemorary, in regards to a totalitarian fascist state rising out of fear of terrorism.

<b>Easter</b>

I'm going down to the hometown on Tuesday for an early Easter, as the 13th would have been my grandmother's 100th birthday. I'm glad she never made it - she would never have been aware of the attention she deserved. We'll drink a toast to her memory. I'm just hoping my brother turns up.

This might be a little long, but bear with me. If you don't have a bear, grab the nearest raccoon.

Last week I got a call from someone from Victim Support, an organisation for helping people who are victims of crime. It's run by the Justice Department, but separate from the cops. Anyway, since I had been Burgled By Scum twice, I was considered to be a <i>victim</i>.

So I was told that I might be deserving of a free BurglarScum alarm, professionally installed and everything. Even better than the one I bought myself. So I arranged for the chap to drop in for a chat this Monday.

Since he didn't phone beore I had to leave for a staff meeting, I assumed he'd call again to arrange a later time. As it was, he called during the meeting, so I suggested he see me at work. He arrived, we met, shook hands, and he confirmed he'd arrange for the alarm people to call and set it all up. Done.

So then after work I went shopping - a little later than usual as I wanted to make up the time I spent in the meetings.

I was trundling down an aisle at the market, adn someone called my name. Someone I didn't recognise. He realised this, and introduced himself as the son of a friend of an old neighbour. He was a <b>lot</b> younger in those days, about 10 or 15 years ago, so it wasn't surprising he was a total stranger. We chatted, he said his mum lived quite nearby and would be interested to get in touch, we shared our mutual love of computer games, and we shared what we did for jobs.

Now here's the weirdness.

He works for the same company that will be installing my BurglarScum alarm, which had been arranged only a few hours previously.

I was aghast. Nay gobsmacked, and my quizzicalness was obviously apparent to her. She responded by adding ""it's not for me. It's for a friend, and it's under protest"". So I pointed out that both cuts were insanely expensive but very yummy, and she indicated she didn't want to spend lots of dosh anyway.

So I steered her to the honey and soy marinated BBQ steaks, she said ""well, it's only for a barbecue anyway"" and with a flourish of satisfaction and solved problem, swept the bleeding protein into her trolley. 

Another good deed done!

However my evening repast consisted of spicy noodles, a couple of slices of Vogels bread smeared with plum jam, and a nice hot cup of tea. Yummers.

Argh!

Success! Yay! Now the buggerulars will know they're moving around and stealing stuff because a box is shrieking at them.

<b>Account-ability</b>
After mucho procrastination I finally got my incomes and expenses entered into a database so I can print them out, one year per page. Now I hope the accountant will be able to drop by on Thursday and check them through. I still need some historic values, but they may be more hassle than they're worth.

<b>Game Stuff</b>
I've taken a break from BaddeManors for a while to get some urgent stuff, including the above, done. I love the game, although not so much in its present form. I'll see how it goes but for those interested, it should only be a matter of days... or weeks.

In the meantime I'm playing a game called Four Cities. It's fun in an exploratory sort of way - as I play it it actually gets more interesting, with little bits of humour. It still lacks the challenge and communication that is Pyroto and BaddeManors.

<b>Free Calls?</b>
I tried out yet another VOIP client today. It promised free calls to landlines in selected countries, so it sounded worth it. Here's the link http://internetcalls.com/en/index.html - see if you can find the small print.

I called my mum, talked for an hour with a very frustrating half-second delay, and then it cut out. Apparently I still need to credit an account with 10 euros.

Maybe.

I'm still feeling a bit down, especially after finding all my DVDs taken. I'm still remembering what some of them were - for instance, a special director's edition of Donnie Darko.

So I gave myself some therapy by spending $300 of vouchers on a burglar alarm (just a cheap whiny one), a new DVD player that will be CHAINED DOWN! and another MP3 player. I watched Sin City the other night all the way through, and noticed stuff I didn't see in the theatre - <b>awesome</b> movie. Awesome.

<b>Television Favourites</b>
They've started <i>Stargate Atlantis</i> here - finally. Bad news is it's on a poor reception channel. It looks good, but I suspect the characters are going to suck from the pilot episode.

<i>My Name is Earl</i> continues to delight - I love it. Some episodes fall short, but the last one about making fun of other people's accents was brilliant.

<i>Lost</i> is up to Ep 3 and is getting manic. Psycho hatch dweller, psycho Michael whining for his kid, and psycho natives.

<i>Invasion</i> is fairly standard pop-people fare - it looks mildly predictable, but it's attracted me so far. Being just after The 4400 finished, I think there's some subliminal programming going on here to prepare us for the aliens.

I'm just waiting for the accountant to come and show me how to do my taxes, so it looks like I'll be taking today off work. It's a nice hot day - I think I'd rather be where there's air conditioning."

<lj-cut text=""Under here"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sisters next door</span>
Mum came in from outside, a bit breathless, and said she had been picking fruit off a tree in the empty back property, with the new neighbours. ""Nice girls"" she said. ""Just moved in to the little cottage. No men around. On had a tshirt that said 'Gay...' something. Do you think they might be...?"" ""Yes, mum, very possibly"" She giggled a bit, and said that they'd make good neighbours and she'd made friends already. My mum's getting a bit more broadminded these days.

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Christmas Day</span>
Mum had decided not to cook dinner on The Day, as it's really only down to her an me, so she bought a ticket to the Mayor's Dinner. It's for all the old lonely people who would otherwise be on their own. She thought my bro might get the message.
Anyway, bro P turned up at 10am to get his presents, then took off to his wife's relatives for more socialising a few minutes later. We toddled off to the dinner and met my friend L there.
It was a great dinner - the pre-dinner ""entertainment"" was a bit bleak, but there was lots of food, pudding, prize draws and everyone got a gift.
I was hoping L would give mum a lift back home, but she took off suddenly with her neighbour who was also there. Mum did not enjoy the walk back - she managed the walk there, but in the heat and after a meal, it was a strain for her. I was not very pleased with L about that. So we just took it easy for the rest of the day.

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Boxing Day</span>
I was supposed to go to P's place because it was his birthday - mum didn't show much interest, so it was going to be just me. However P's wife's mother suddenly got very sick with an abdominal aneurism, something that was due to happen any time, amd was taken to hospital with little chance of living. She died peacefully the next day, so the rest of the holiday I saw very little of P, and nothing of his wife D. She was shattered, and it was not a a good time.

The funeral was a few days later. Mum went, and said it was one of the weirdest she had been to, and she's been to a few lately. P and D left to go north to see D's daughter and granddaughter a couple of days later, so we probably got to see P for a total of about two hours for the whole holiday. That was a disappointment, as I haev always regarded my trip to Nelson as an opportunity to see all the family.

The rest of my time there was quite restful. Mum and I went to see Narnia, which I'd totally recommend, although she had a weird claustrophobic attack at the start, whcih scared me a bit, but she got over it after she went out for a glass of water.

On the whole, it was a good time to spend with mum - we had some great talks about things we would never have shared years ago, and I just felt she was very lonely and missing my brother.
I left her with a laptop computer I got from work, so she could learn to get emails. She's determined to make it work, as she can see so many people she knows using them these days.

</lj-cut>
So I got back to Auckland on the Wednesday and was in at work on the Thursday, as R was leaving for Malaysia on Saturday and I needed some time with him.

Now it's all back to normal."

It's a tradition I arrive in Nelson on the 18th in time for mum's birthday on the 19th - it's like my birthday present to her. There's nothing much I can get her for a present these days, so we've agreed on that.

She insisted on shouting a birthday dinner at the Pheasant Plucker - a restaurant in a puub just along the road - my brother P and his wife came too, which was quite a surprise, as they never made it for mum's previous birthday at all.

The rest of the week was mainly going into town (only a 10 minute walk) and looking around the shops figuring out ideas for presents. Not too many family and friends left to consider these days, so I figured out a book for my brother, and he and I decided to get mum a DVD player between us. As I've given up on ""surprise"" presents these days, I asked mum first if she'd like one, and she was okay about it. I just had to teach her how to use it.

The DVD I had brought down for her didn't last the flight - although it was working perrfectly at home, it must have been dropped as it refused to read discs. It was only $50 - we dropped it off at a repair shop but they just charged us $40 to tell us it wasn't worth fixing.

I always have to get myself a present, so I got an MP3 player - $50 for a 128Mb one, which is a couple of CDs worth - I want to use it at work to zone out as it's very distracting with phones going all the time.

I got L some small speakers for her laptop - they aren't great quality but are designed to fit in a bag so she can use them for presentations.

I managed to bully my brother P into meeting me for a drink in town - it was tricky as his wife was having an after-work party so I had to kick his arse a few times. Anyway, it was a pleasant conversation over a beer or two, and although we didn't get to discuss anything really serious, it established that we were still capable of a brother-to-brother relationship. It was also made interesting by encountering his ex-wife on the way to the pub and seeing his reaction while we stopped and chatted. He was rather uncomfortable.

I'm off in a few hours to sunny Nelson, to spend a couple of weeks with the remnants of the family. Aah, two weeks of sleeping, watching TV, visiting, shopping, seeing movies (King Kong! Narnia!) and generally giving the brain a rest for a while.

I have a laptop on loan to take with me, so I'll be able to catch up with email, LJ and BM. It will be severely rationed.

I'm taking my DVD player down with a bunch of movies so mum can catch up on a few she might never have seen. If she likes having a DVD player, and can use it, I'll leave it with her, and suggest she joins up with a hire place. She'll probably say she doesn't have time, but she does need to slow down.

"event","I've just got back from the annual company dinner, this year held at a restaurant named <a href=""http://www.hammerheads.co.nz/"">Hammerheads</a> - we'd been there before a couple of years ago, and although expensive (about $50 per person) the service and food was excellent.

I had a seafood chowder, pan-fried schnapper on rice with a mesclun salad and very tasty string fries, and a cappucino. I'm full!

There was only one rule - no shop talk - which was quite easy to do as we do that at work all the time. It was good to see the generosity of the directors, A and D, so we didn't feel as if they couldn't afford it, and we accepted it as their way of saying thanks.

We were actually the last diners to leave at about 11pm, which is a good indication of the satisfaction factor.

I had two calls on the machine when I got home - one for the Trust chairman (I'll ring him tomorrow) and my mum, who just wanted a chat. I'll ring her Monday night."

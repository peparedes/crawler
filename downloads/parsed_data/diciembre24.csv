<H2>Little Known Christmas Fact</H2>
<P>Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual trip...but there were problems everywhere. 
<P>Four of his elves were sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. 
<P>Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More Stress. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. So, frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the he kitchen floor. 
<P>He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. 
<P>Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said: ""Where would you like to put this tree Santa?"" 
<P>And that my friends, is how the little angel came to be on top of the Christmas tree. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>i hope every one has a wonderful holiday. I love you!!!</P>
<P>xoxo,dc</P>"

<P><FONT color=#000099 size=5>It is with the saddest heart that I must pass on the following news: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099 size=5>Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community. The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71. Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high with flours. Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for millions. Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough; two children John Dough and Jane Dough; plus they have one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father Pop Tart. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes. </FONT></P>

I guess i always under estimated ""talking"", it helps a lot in the long run, and is really the only fair way to resolve somthing. I guess i've been a sort of hypocrite from that standpoint. my advice to people with problems was to always confront the other party, talk it over, if they listen and you listen most likely things will be resolved. right? maybe i never actually beleived the advice that i, myself was dishing out to others. but, i do now...i know what i feel like now that i've talked, and i have the feeling that life, in general, is going to be getting alot better... for everyone. so to every one who i have ever told ""just talk to them, and it will be ok"", my advice to you does not change, the only differenc is i now believe it myself. Thankyou to those of you who made me realize my own advice, by giving it back to me; and to those of you whose confrontations are not yet solved...""just talk to them and every thing will be ok.""...i honestly mean it this time.

"event","Slow Dance 
Have you ever watched kids
on a merry-go-round
Or listened to the rain
slapping on the ground?

Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?

You better slow down
Don't dance so fast
Time is short
The music won't last

Do you run through each day on the fly
When you ask ""How are you?""
do you hear the reply?

When the day is done,
do you lie in your bed
With the next hundred chores
running through your head?

You'd better slow down
Don't dance so fast
Time is short
The music won't last

Ever told your child,
We'll do it tomorrow
And in your haste, not see his sorrow?

Ever lost touch,
Let a good friendship die
'Cause you never had time
to call and say ""Hi""?

You'd better slow down
Don't dance so fast
Time is short
The music won't last

When you run so fast to get somewhere
You miss half the fun of getting there.

When you worry and hurry through your day,
It is like an unopened gift....
Thrown away...

Life is not a race.
Do take it slower
Hear the music
Before the song is over."

I'm sooooooooooo incredibly glad that bunny and eric got to hang out, i know how terrible it feels to be away from your best friend for that long and how great it feels to finally be back with them! I feel really good about eric and i and even though we havn't been out alone in a while we're still having fun and things are really good between us. he's wonderful! i'm glad that eric and tay hav become such good friends and have sleep overs like every night ( even though they bring out the mean girl in each other.)lol. the show is going to be great, and we're friends with alot of incredibly talented people, and that also makes me happy. I love you all and even thought this happiness may wear off in a little while i'm  going to enjoy it while it lasts because lifes too short to focus on the negetive. I love you all with all my heart!

I can't give solutions to all of life's problems, doubts, or fears.
but I can listen to you, and together we will search for answers.

I can't change your past with all it's heartache and pain, 
nor the future with its untold stories.
But i can be there now when you need me to care.

I can't keep your feet from stumbling.
I can only offer my hand that you may grasp it and not fall.

Your joys, triumphs, successes, and happiness are not mine; 
yet i can share in your laughter. 

Your decisions in life are not mine to make, nor to judge;
I can only support you, encourage you,
and help you when you ask.

I can't prevent you from falling away from friendship,
from you values, from me.
I can only pray for you, talk to you, and wait for you. 

I can't give you boundaries which i have determined for you,
 But I can give you the room to change, room to grow,
room to be yourself.

I can't keep your heart from breaking and hurting,
But i can cry with you and help you pick up the pieces
and put them back in place.

I can't tell you who you are.
I can only love you and be your friend.

I'm sorry to anyone that i have hurt, i would never intentionally do that. i love you all very much. i hope that every one feels better and know that i am always here for you know matter what.

I walked around nyu yesterday and i'm going back today for  the open house so that i can right this trip off as school business. walking around nyu reminded me of eric, i saw some of the director students there and he would fit in perfectly. this both made me sad and happy. sad well we all know why it makes me sad...it makes every one else sad too that he'll be leaving but  it also made me incredibly happy that he'll have such a wonderful time and so many oportunities in college! ...wow! that got really sappy really fast!lol! i don't even know how that happened. closing night of the show kids, have fun and milk it for all its worth! oh i forgot my uncles company is doing work in studio 54 (thats a theatre that used to be a night club)and i got to stand on this huge broadway stage while they were striking the set of a street car named desire. that was pretty amazing it gave me goose bumps...us theatre kids are so easily entertained. ok....now im done. i love and miss you all and i'll see you soon.

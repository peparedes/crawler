You are<br>an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for<br>one reason or another - possibly, you made one<br>tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or<br>maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't<br>commit. In any case, you are faithless and<br>joyless. You find no happiness, love, or<br>acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most<br>days are a burden and you wonder when the<br>hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and<br>sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching<br>picture. You are the one that few understand.<br>Those that do know you are likely to love you<br>deeply and wish that they could do something to<br>ease your pain. You are constantly living in<br>memories of better times and a better world.<br>You are hard on yourself and self-critical or<br>self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved,<br>you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite<br>your tainted nature, your soul is<br>breathtakingly beautiful.

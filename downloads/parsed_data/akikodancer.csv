"event","So Sunday night I called Will and he had been feeling sad. The roads were horrible and I couldn't come see him, so I asked him why. His response: This relationship sucks, he's not happy and he's never going to be. My thoughts, okay so you're going to break up with me, obviously, and I had no idea. So my blood sugar is like 300, so I decide to go home and call him later. I cry home, light candles and drink lots of Bacardi when I get home, get my blood sugar back to normal, and finally call him. I spent like 3 or 4 hours on the phone with him, mostly in tears, and finally everything worked out and he said he really loved me and I said if we were both willing we could make it work and I'm more than willing. So we agreed to try and to communicate better and see each other more often. I have to go now, but I'll go into more details tomorrow.

"event","So I talked to Will and everything is fine. He said he could never be mad at me and he just doesn't understand why I've had two pretty unjustified outbursts at him because he doesn't think he deserves it - which he doesn't. So we're good. 

I apologized to Chinwe yesterday and now we're good, which is really nice - I've really missed her. She's been going through shit with her friends and fighting a lot with Drew. She said she's never had an orgasm, either - so that's kinda depressing. 

I went over to Will's last night to do my homework and I was looking forward to being up in his room or something, but we stayed downstairs and then Alana came and it sucked. But I went home by 10pm, so it was okay. 

Ms. Robbins wasn't wearing a hat today and her hair was shorter, but it looked good. Maybe she's doing pretty well. I am going to fail that class, though, because I never do the questions for the reading because I don't understand ANYTHING in that book. Also, I don't know any grammar whatsoever, and we have a test on Tuesday, so I'm pretty screwed.

Tonight Sage Francis is doing a show at Tulagi's. Claire wants to go but can't pay, so I offered to pay for her - but then I found out that it's $14 and that's kinda expensive. I'm still going to pay for her, but I just hope that it's worth it. 

I'm really excited about going to Miami. Leif is going to come and I really hope Katie comes!!! That would be soooo awesome!!!

Joan and I are trying to plan a trip for spring break, but we don't want to be boring and go to Mexico, but we don't want to pay a lot either, so hmmmm....

Well, I'm bored, so maybe I'll try to do some homework - yeah right.

"event","I have to go and talk to Will tonight and I'm frankly quite terrified. I honestly believe that if it doesn't go well, it could be the end of us and that is the last thing that I want. I have decided what to say to him - with help from Claire and David. David said he would be pissed if his girlfriend said that stuff to him in front of his friends and Will sure is. He and Claire also recommended, though, that no matter what I don't compromise myself. So I plan to first of all apologize for my mistake in attacking him so unthoughtfully and non-delicately in front of his friends. I think that there is no excuse for that and I messed up for sure, but I am truly sorry. Honestly, I just forgot that his friends were there! Then I will apologize for attacking him about how he lives his life, because honestly I don't really care and he ought to live however he is happiest and I, as his girlfriend, of all people should recognize and respect that. Nevertheless, he should not have told me that he was going to come if he wasn't really going to. He let me down and made me sad. But I do realize that it is somewhat hypocritical of me to be upset about it, as I know I have done the same to him. But it did upset me and that's why I responded in the manner that I did. Then I have to listen to him..... I know he will say that he can't go on fighting with me every weekend - that sucks. I agree, but I honestly think we have to work through some things that keep coming up in order to move forward in our relationship. I also want him to know that I wouldn't be wasting my time with someone who I couldn't see myself with in the long run. And I know that I may be leaving next fall, but there are a lot of variables and for all I know, I could not get accepted anywhere and end up going to CU. In this case, we wouldn't have any trouble staying together. And even if I do leave, what was meant to be will happen - if it's true love and we were meant to be together, I have to hold on to that possibility and not mess up the amazing present that we have based on the possible outcomes of the future. It is worth it to me to give up everything now and live in the moment and perhaps everything will work out and we can stay together forever and get married and have kids....I'd love to do that with you, Will. I want to grow old with you and sit on the porch and tell our grandchildren stories... I love you. No matter what I have to be true to myself and live in the moment and right now all I know for sure is that I love you.
 
God - I guess I got carried away and started just addressing that directly to Will! Well maybe he will telepathically get the message. 

Well, I'm at work...not exactly working so hard...but I've been REALLY sick, with the flu or something. I have to go to Shelley's around 6pm, but I think I'll leave here around 5 and go get some tea and think a bit. After Shelley's I have to go over to Will's.... I really hope it all works out! Wish me luck!

Ciao,
Laura"

"event","So right as we (Claire and I) were getting to Will's house tonight, Peter (my cousin) called. He said his regiment or whatever had been called to Kuwait - as many have been now to fight in Iraq. So there really is going to be some kind of bullshit war and my poor cousin has to go fight in it!! He hasn't even lived yet! But first, for a month he's going to be training at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, so if I'm allowed to, I'll go and visit him. It's really sad too because he did get accepted to the University of Utah!! Which I think is amazing, but now he can't go for another year or so....depending....Even Peter, a staunch Republican who has been interested in war since he was born, no longer supports Bush's decisions and says it's just a political battle and there is no real need for war. Yet Bush gets angry at the members of the UN who ask for more time for the weapons inspectors. And he completely avoids the North Korea issue. His mind is set on killing Sadaam Husein however possible and whomever gets in the way or who happens to be possibly affected is unimportant to him. What a fucking asshole!!! Drop Bush, not bombs!!! Fucking A, I'm so upset. We spend all this money and effort on bullshit when we could be finding cures for diseases and funding education. I really hate America sometimes. And then you see in the newspaper - on the front page - an article about how Americans are fat (or how they 'supersize' their meals). NO shit!!! Who the hell prints this shit? Are you a fucking idiot? Or a really FAT fucking idiot? I cannot get over how much money is spent on weightloss and exercise stuff in the US while billions of people are starving all over the world. I am thoroughly disgusted with our sick, money-greedy, glutonous nation. Fuck it."

"event","So Claire and I and her friend Colleen went snowboarding at Winter Park today. It was really fun and a really nice day, except that I got low after lunch and couldn't really move much. Anyhow, I invited Claire up to my house to take a hot tub with me after snowboarding and then to Will's after that and so she said yes. Well, I dropped Colleen off at the dorm and invited her to Claire's suprise party while Claire was grabbing her suit. Anyways, she called David and evidently he was really mad at her. I guess the night before they had gone to a party and Claire had been drunk and unruly (what's new? - just kidding!) and spilled a drink on the carpet, etc., etc. Well Claire evidently invited David up to her dorm room and he said he no thanks but she said she really wanted to have sex with him and he still said no. So she got pissy and called him an asshole or something and blah blah blah (that's all I got of the story). Well I guess he was pretty upset and said it wasn't going to work out if she didn't stop doing those kind of things. So Claire resolved to never drink in front of David anymore, but that's so not Claire's nature that it's kind of sad. But I guess everything is temporarily okay and hopefully will stay that way. Best wishes Claire and David."

"event","I'm so upset I'm too drained to cry. I wish I could - just let it all out with tears and then have him kiss me and have everything be okay. But it's not okay. It's this goddamn existentialism thing that's getting me - i feel almost void of emotions and yet I know that actually that's only because I'm too upset to let myself feel any emotion. I keep thinking about M. Meursault in Camus' The Stranger and Marie.....I guess I'll go and call him again.
I need to call John too...but that's on the backburner. I can't work until everything is okay with Will and me."

"event","I am so depressed. I really miss Will. Last night I yelled at him and said that I was sick of the whole wussitis thing because I'm diabetic and enjoy sleeping and need to work hard in school and I'll never live up to being like Claire and being drunk as fuck all the time....and furthermore, when I feel like guys don't listen to me it pisses me off because I'm a raging feminist and I feel pressured to drink and smoke pot and just because I'm not addicted to pot or alcohol shouldn't mean that I have this fucking ""wussitis"" bullshit. Then he said that it was like he said earlier in the week, we're incompatible and if I want out then fine. And I said no, I love you. And he said it's okay, I'm fine being alone, I'm used to it and ran inside and slammed the door and went up to his room. When I got home I called and said ""I love you and I'm sorry and if you want to, when you feel ready, give me a call."" And now it's two in the afternoon and he always gets up at nine in the morning and he hasn't called yet and I think I'm going to die. I really love him and can't live without him and I thought he felt the same way, but now I don't know. Maybe he's just scared and he really does love me but he was afraid and so he just took the easy way out. I have finals this week and I don't think that I can go on living - I am so upset. Will, if you're listening, I love you baby and I hope you'll let me apologize and we can work things out. I can't live without you."

"event","So last night I went over to Will's - I only intended on staying shortly (an hour or less), but he was really tired and I made him go to bed and gave him a ""goodnight"" kiss......oops! Things got hot and heavy and soon he was feeling me up and kissing my neck...and he unzipped my sweater with his teeth (ooohhh sexy!!!). Then I got on top of him and felt his dick against my pants, nice and hard. Then he was grabbing my boobs again and one fell out of my bra and he sucked it - oh my god!!! And I came....Then we hugged and I tried to leave....well, eventually I left and went home and used our brand-new hottub for the first time. It was really beautiful - a perfectly clear night with amazing stars and the moon. Awwww. And the hot tub is just the right size for 2 people, if ya know what I mean. And my parents are going to be in Hawaii for 10 days in about 2 weeks....Sex in the hot tub for sure!!!"

"event","Well, today some annoying lady in the Sussel lab was bitching about the smell of cigarettes - it doesn't smell at all - shut up, lady!!! God, getting here was a pain in the ass! First, I had to buy gas..okay. Then, the sun was so hot bearing down on me, so I was really uncomfortable. So then I try to park - low and behold, there's a spot in non-2hour, so I try to take it. Oh my God!!! Fuck parallel parking!!! After much aggravation and sweating and probably hitting both cars, I determined either the spot was too small or I'm just not talented enough to park there. Okay, so I calm down and park somewhere else. Then I NEED a cigarette, which I have, but I don't want to smell like smoke. But fuck it, I really need one, so I try to light it. First, I burn my thumb really badly and it hurt a lot. Then, before I even really get a good drag, I see this guy who looks like Dr. Chase - so I try to put it out and end up breaking it. FUCK!!! So I give up. But then the annoying lady bitching about cigarette smoke!!! AGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Oh well, at least there was no one here, so I'm alone and playing on the internet. So long."

"event","God damn math notecards!!! I fucking hate Ms. Hutchinson - but only 5 more days of having to see her face!!! Thank god. Anyways, I read The Stranger by Albert Camus today. What a book. It made me realize that I really am afraid of death. And that I really love Will and couldn't bear to lose him. I just don't know what Marie did - I think I'd go nuts. It was crazy - quite a headtrip. Well, Taylor is going back to Tulane tomorrow (in New Orleans). He's cool - he's my favorite of Will's friends, so it's sad that he's going. But oh well. Anyways - 20 hours of french - really not done at all. But it's almost the end of the semester!!! Then only second semester and I'm taking all right-brained classes (i think that's right - lit, history, and french). It will be really nice. Well, wish me luck on my finals. Need to sleep - very sore from ballet. Hot tub almost ready for use - FINALLY!!! When my parents go to Hawaii in two weeks - me and Will alone in the hot tub....yeah baby!!! I can't wait. I really miss not seeing him everyday. I wonder if he really would be interested in leaving Boulder and coming to live somewhere with me - that would be wonderful. As much as I ""need to experience the world alone,"" and I guess that is supposed to entitle meeting a lot of different guys, I've already found a really amazing one whom I love to death. hmmm.... life's decisions are really hard - but I am definetly going to leave here to go to school (and to Paris) - with or without Will (even though I really do wish he'd come). Well, we'll see what life has in store for me. I was looking at my baby book tonight w/my parents and it's really amazing what a happy kid I was - and really still am. It's a gift and I'm really lucky to have such an incredible life. Maybe I should stop pissing off my parents so much - I really don't mean to. I would really love to have kids and a great family with Will but first I need to help him be happy and enjoy life. His low self-esteem and unhappiness are his only problems and I wish, for his sake and because I love him and don't want him to be unhappy, that he could really love being alive like I do. I wish everyone could. Maybe I'll introduce him to Maharaji and he'll find ""the light"" or whatever, so to speak. Who knows?"

I've been doing my Columbia application and I always get kinda depressed when it says to list awards and honors I've received because I've never received any. And it's not like I've never competed in anything that I'm good at - Peak Arts Spring Festival scholarship award thing I've competed in for the last several years and have never won even third place (FUCK you Jasmine, Annaliese, and all the rest of you skinny little ballet dancing pieces of shit!) I'm sorry, but I really fucking hate you - I'm a much better dancer than some of you - I am much more beautiful and mature, even if my body does have curves. Fuck the ballet world for wanting anorexic little hyperextended bone-showing bitches!!!!! Why can't I do the ballet that I love and look as beautiful as I feel dancing and not be overlooked by companies just because I'm not a stick??? Have you seen the movie Real Women Have Curves? It's awesome and I highly recommend it to everyone. Okay, I'm done bitching now. I feel much better. Tooodles!"

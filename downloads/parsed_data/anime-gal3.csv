"event","never realized how impossible it must have been,
setting myself on unacceptable axioms.

~
was it too much to expect you 
to see me as how i wanted you to see me. 
beautiful, frail, prevailing, lost. 
floating on a surface of contradictions. 

but maybe it should be enough
for me to try to be the things
i dream myself to be
for me alone. 

you'll love me as i want you to love me or you don't.
~

this is the shedding of facade. 
the abandonment of awkwardness."

Only things I would like to see changed about myself is to be more able to manage my time, have a higher energy/motivation level and stop being so easily tired and distracted, and more aware of my surroundings.

"event","Ted pointed out to me something I didn't realize that people might get the wrong impression of. To clarify, I didn't post that stuff Dave wrote to me so you guys feel sorry for me or think Dave as a dick. Certainly the opposite; I wanted people to empathize with dave in hating me and get his side out. I'm sorry if it appears the opposite. 

Here's the truth: 
I was a bitch and shouldn't have done any of the following (in no particular order).
- I blamed Dave for my own procrastination.
- I blamed him for failing in school.
- I lied to him about wanting to work things out because I couldn't handle the drama. (this issue was a little touchy for me because it's kind of a reaction that i HAD to use with my dad.)
- I hung up on him when he was crying.
- I tried to break up with him near his birthday.
- I started being annoyed by his displays of affections.
- I made him do favors for me and didn't return them back. 
- I held grudges because I didn't know how to compromise properly.
- I was very rarely sincere with my apology and provide correct grievances.
- I'll run away from a fight.
- I didn't take his criticism seriously.

- I should've never told Dave I loved him when I wasn't ready.
- I should've never gone out with him to leave him like that.


Again, not asking you to feel sorry for me. I can live with all of the above, so that should tell you how un-empathetic I can be. 

If there's something I'm missing, feel free to add."

wow. lj. havent' done this for a while. i don't even remember my user names and passwords for my other accounts. now should i start using this account or just continue using my blogger account? i hate having two or three blogs for things... but there are a few people i know who are still using it. meh.

i'm feeling very nostalgic and having these weird reminiscing episodes which sometimes make me cringe a little. i haven't been like that for a while, at least for a year and a half. i don't mind it. i feel very full from the experience. i wonder how full i'll feel when i'm eighty and have eighty years of memories to go through. 

i hate how i screwed up this year, academic wise. but i'm not too upset if i can make up for it this year. yay for physics. boo for making it difficult. so i'll have no life next year (not that i did this year for other reasons). 

people have been telling me about relationships stories which is a subject i'm not very well versed in, lol. but i kind of find it funny and a little insulted. i understand these people are venting, and that's totally needed. however, for example, this guy i met at the observatory is telling how he gets screwed over because he's always trying to be the nice guy and the girl never pays attention to him or stays with him... that and because he's a physicist. he seems like a very mature and smart guy, and it made it that more amusing to see him talk about grade/high school relationships. but i'm sitting there thinking... wait, this guy keeps telling me of how he's going after the girl every guy wants and every girl wants to be. first mistake; why doesn't he ever pick the nice girls to go out with, instead of the class hottie. second he tells me how he tries to be sincere and cool with the girls but is now being bitter about being sincere and cool to them because they didn't return feelings, not totally altruistic in my opinion.  

but seriously, you are a dick if you are nice to a girl but turn a cold shoulder once you realize she doesn't intend to sleep with you. a dick with a persona.

i hope i don't get bitter when someone breaks my heart. i hope i can still understand that it was their decision, a decision they are free to make, and something they have to live with as well. and if the relationship failed because of my faults, then i hope i can realize what they are and fixed them so that it will work out better with the next person i care about. but seeing how touchy it is, i'm not sure i could handle it as well as i hope i can."

"event","I try to be the first to admit to a flaw, a fault, a mistake.  So I'll admit to being stuck in the libertarian stigma.  

Free will, it doesn't exist. I can say that and believe it, but what does it really mean to me?   Does that mean you have no choice? Does it mean a criminal is not at fault for his crimes?   In-doctrine truth says no.  We like to believe we have choice.  The illusion is that we have choice.  We like to think one's actions are explicitly the result of that one person.  But if you take one moment of out of your life to think about how you got where you are.  In that room, reading this article, on that computer, on this live journal, meeting me, getting a computer, internet existing, you existing, computers inventing.... It goes back to what seems infinity.  Were these factors in your control?  What we call ""decision"" or ""choice"" is really just our response to the environment and past experiences and consequential thoughts, it is part of being a living organism. There's nothing wrong about or abnormal or inhuman about it.

So back to the questions: Does that mean you have no choice? Does it mean a criminal is not at fault for his crimes? If Free Will does not exist, then the answer is really yes. No matter how much you don't want to believe it.  Does that mean my life is pointless to live, because all my ""decisions"" have been made for me? No because I don't find that a useful way to live.  And I don't find that a useful way to live because I've tried in the past, and it made life suck.  And I tried it in the past because I had thought of this same dilemma, and I thought of this dilemma because... well that's as far as I can remember.  But can you see, do you realize that my responses are built on top of other responses, experiences, and other influences.  My responses are not predetermined in a sense you can predict it indefinitely (mainly because there are just too many factors involved: the way your brain is wired, way other people are wired, the weather, the responses of all the people in the world)?  But you can predict a probability of how people will respond through science (ie psychology) and research (ie statistics). And when people use that knowledge to control people, there's where we have mind numbing media and horribly intensively purposeful propaganda.  So once you introduce a new thought, once you experience something else, once other people have effected you in their own predetermined way, you're already setting yourself for a whole different future then you might have seen yourself a moment ago (even the thought of the future is affecting your future and that thought was caused by something else (it's just so hard to keep track of causes because you can keep going)).

As for the question of the criminal.  Should we kill a murderer because their life has led them to kill someone else?  I don't think so.  Should we let the murderer go? Uh, no! Should we lock them away in prisons that would just negatively influence them?  That doesn't solve anything except keep them away from the public for a set time, and possibly allowing them to negatively influence other prisoners.  The solution should be to find the cause of why they murdered and treat them, and allow them to be positive influences, and re-enter society no longer as a murderer.  I know this sounds all hippy-cock.  But you and I both know prisons the way they are now don't work.  And more sickening, they can be forced to do outsourced work without pay.

Wait, what about quantum indeterminacy! You science geeks like I know you are will ask.  Doesn't quantum indeterminacy allow for chance?  Um. I don't know if you haven't notice, but we don't live in a quantum world.  Our cells don't even live in a quantum world.  Micro-organisms don't live in quantum worlds.  Nano-organisms are the closest to living in a quantum world.  And even they probably don't get affected by quantum physics (don't quote me on that. I'm still a physicist in-training).  I don't really believe that life as we know it can be derived from at the quantum scale.  But you got me, I have no proof for this.  But it will be my mission to find it.  But it just makes sense.  (And yes, common sense is not the best use of evidence.  But common sense also says we have free will too.)  I love the quote Dave gave me or I read somewhere about this general or ceo or someone relatively smart decided to put two and two together.  Goes something like: If my atoms are mostly empty space, and wall atoms are mostly empty space... omg I can hypothetically walk through walls!  *Runs at wall.* OUCH! Ooops forgot about CHEMISTRY.  Of course atoms having electric fields and forming bonds and intermolecular forces are involved but I hope it is somewhat analogical. I'm sure string theory or that unified theory of everything will be able to tie in quantum universe to human-size universe together, and I will be very interested to learn how it works (biochemistry may greatly benefit), but even then it probably will give proof that quantum indeterminacy does not mean our lives are based purely on chance. At least not since the beginning of the universe. 

In conclusion, how the machinery of our lives work shouldn't change the fact we should be striving for global social justice.  All it does is clarify how we can go about.  And how people have used our determinacy to their advantage and purposefully keep us in the Free Will loophole.  (Even debating about Free Will keeps us in the loophole. So I will not be entertaining any arguments, I'll just have to work on writing a more scientifically proven essay.) All I can ask, is that you take that one second to seriously think of how you got where you are in life.  (Hey if an 16 -year-old me entertained it. You certainly can.) And just hypothetically assume life without Free Will and if the brain freeze doesn't kill you, maybe you can stop believing in libertarianism and then de-constructing all the political policies that are based on it and taking advantage of our belief in libertarian values.

I fell asleep at about 3am and woke up around 6:30am just in time to finish up writing my cards and put my gifts downstairs.

I had a weird dream in between.  I dreamt I had to pretend I was dead or had to hide away from a some mafia boss with the help of a friend and a boyfriend and I was pregnant at the same time.  It was very Kill Bill or Alias.  The first time, the bf or guy hero helped me get out.  The second time a friend came and told me the guy hero had died and I had to hide in the basement of the house I was at because the Mafia boss was coming here and there was not time to go out or the place was guarded. And it ended with me stuck in a room with a gunshot through the door. Because of the sucky ending, I redreamt the second dream's ending, so the third time was like the second except the gunshot went through the friend before it went through the door, with the possibility of my friend shooting at least some of the mafia.

Today was alright.  I got something for someone's mom and two skirts for myself.  I've been wondering what to get for my sis.  I know I can get my bro-in-law an amp for his electric guitar.  I'm thinking of getting her theatre tickets. Should I get three or just two?  I'm thinking it would be the two of us, but would it be right to leave out her hubby or a friend? Not that her hub would want to go (unless it was actiony).  And I don't really want her to think she has to take me, because then it's like I bought it for myself and not for her, so maybe I'll get her two and insist on not being the one going.  I know she'll 'preciate shakespeare, but it should be a night off for her, and she doesn't need to be confuzzeled with Shakespearean language. I'll have to check out where the ticket master is and what shows are available, and all that shizaz."

I've learned one thing for sure, I shouldn't consume copious amounts of caffeine on minimal amounts of food.  Went to play billiards with Dave.  I suck most royally at the game, but I find it addictive to play none the less.  However, I don't think I will play it again while sober.  I have officially and indefinitely tied alcohol with pool.  And since pool is addictive, I think I see where I'm going to be drunk.  

I met up with Sarah.  She most willingly followed me while I aimlessly promenaded down King.  But it was awesome to talk with her.  Saw Maggie too!  Of course we three talked about Kevin.  Oh his bio nerdiness will be remembered forever.  

I had a lady calling from Scotland wishing to buy a giftcard for her son.  The transaction took about 45 minutes to complete.  She had an awesome accent.  I really hope her giftcard doesn't get lost now.  My driver's license did eventually come.  So maybe there is faith left in our postal service."

<lj-cut text=""This is for Dawe."">
So, I'm supposed to be writing about my 'avoiding' tendencies right?  Actually I'm exercising it right now. I'm avoiding calling people I was calling a week ago.  Nice. Why do I like to avoid people? Because I'm a passive person, who doesn't give a fuck.  I mean that should be enough to explain things right?  I guess this is one reason I left home.  I could never say anything to my parents without getting some huge lecture or backlash so I stop bothering.  There's also that idea in my head to shut up and be submissive because if you retaliate you're just a annoying bitch.  Not that it stops me from being an annoying bitch.  Then there's me using my nihilism as an excuse not to bother with anything.  Basically I give up; I'm a quitter, that's why I avoid.  You can't change people.  You shouldn't try to change people.  So if they win the argument, that's great for them.  I don't care either way; I'm not hurt, no one's hurt.  So what if I get offended and don't say anything.  It's not like you'll change your opinions because of it.  More likely you'll think I'm a dumb twit either way: for saying something different or for not saying anything, so why say.  Secondly I'm tired of being the one to call certain people all the fucken time.  If you don't want me in your life, I'm not going to force anything.  Everyone's busy, and I wouldn't make room for you if I didn't have any either.  There, that's also me and my past experiences being the odd one out every time and left out of everything and so now this is how I handle rejection.

This is not self pity.  This is just how I feel.  And any comments on this section other than from Dawe or Sarah will be ignored because you don't mean it anymore than I do.

See Dave, I can't make sense of anything even if I tried.  I don't know why you wanted so much for me to write this.

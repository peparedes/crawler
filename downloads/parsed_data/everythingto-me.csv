I have decided to update because I want to complain! haha Well Drew just left my house and it was awful..I didn't want him to leave because he is going to the beach this week and he will be gone for TWO WHOLE WEEKS! Not one like at Boys' State...but TWO!&nbsp;I am going to miss him so much! But tonight we spent a few hours together and it was great. The movie we watched was horrible, but I was with him so it was okay. I love spending time with him...when I'm with him nothing else matters! I love that feeling! I think I am falling in love...</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>Well that's about it..I've said enough. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>Ohh! I love you Andrew Clay!</FONT></P>

"event","Hi. I haven't updated in a while and I am really bored so I guess I will update. :) Well today, Christina, Megan, and I all went to Karen Davis's house to visit her. We found out where she lived, but when we got there no one was home. We just kinda chilled on her front porch for a while. We got a little hungry so we went to Wendy's to eat and then came back. Luckily she was home, but she was getting ready to leave again. We were so excited to see her. She was also very excited that we came. We visited for about 25 minutes or so, but then she had to leave. :( She told us to come back anytime, but to make sure to call so we will get to stay there longer. So, next week we are going to go back and go out to lunch or something. And yes we sound like losers going to visit a teacher, but Karen Davis is the COOLEST! lol 

Ohh! Today is mine and Drew's one month anniversary, and he remembered! I was so excited. But he has a surprise for me in a few weeks and he is killing me because he keeps rubbing it in...haha. Ohh and did I mention that Drew SUCKS at surprises? haha. Well he does! 

Strengthening and conditioning for SV cheerleading starts tonight. I am kinda excited to start back, but it's sad because it's my last year of cheering! :( It is very exciting to be a SENIOR though! But I really hope our team is good this year. I mean it is my last year and I really want to have a shot at winning State! We had a shot last year, but we got SCREWED! I am not gonna even talk about that. 

Well I think that's it for now.

Later!"

"event","<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=1>So today we had a cook out at my house and my terrific boyfriend, Drew, came over! This weekend Drew and I have been to three cookouts. I have come to the conclusion that cookouts are cool because it gives me a great excuse to spend time with Drew! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=1>So Drew and I went to Amanda's to watch fireworks tonight and now I am getting ready to go pick her up so she can stay the night with me! Yay!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=1>Ohh and Drew..I would love to go out on the boat with you tomorrow. I will have to ask though! But if you aren't sick of me yet then I would love to be with you all day tomorrow!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=1>But I had a great time today with Drew and so far I've noticed that no matter how much time I spend with him I still miss him when he leaves. I am going to go pick up Amanda now. I love you Drew.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=1>Later.</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Last night Drew and I stopped by my mom's friend's house to show her my car. It was fun. She is crazy. I love her and so does Drew..lol. Then we went to my aunt's house in Wayne for a cookout. It was fun at first, but then I got sick of it..lol. So we left, rented a movie, and went back to his house to watch it. Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because it started POURING the rain and I had to get to my dad's house...in Chesapeake.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>So, this morning my dad and I get up at 7:30 and go eat breakfast with my sister. We came back and then went back out to the bank. When we got back from the bank we washed my car! I went to Olivia's house around 3 for a cookout and got home around 11:15 tonight. It was fun. Drew came with me!! Drew and I watched fireworks too! I love being with Drew. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>But I guess I am finished for now, but I want everyone to know that I love Drew! He makes me so happy! :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Goodnight.</FONT></P>"

Nape, my grandma, Kelly, Debbie, and then KJ. I think that's about it, but I got sang to in a lot of different varieties. It was great! haha Drew surprised me with some flowers! They are gorgeous! Okay well he didn't really surprise me I knew that he had flowers for me..lol! Later I went to Drew's house and we watched Coach Carter and ate some hamburgers. After that I went to Kelly's house because Miss Debbie made me some cheesecake! It was freakin' awesome!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>Ohh! I am having my birthday party tomorrow from 6-9 at my house! It's a pool party. It's gonna be fun. We are having hot dogs and chips to eat and then we are having icecream cake from DQ! I am pumped.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>Also, today I am going somewhere with Kristen Johnson, Kellie Cyrus, and Linsey. I am pretty excited, but we don't know what we are going to do yet..haha. Tonight Shea and Amanda are supposed to come over to see me because they won't be able to come to my birthday party tomorrow. :( </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=1>Well this morning I got up about 8:30 and took a shower. Drew came to pick me up a little before 10 so we could go swimming, but he couldn't get a hold of anyone so we didn't go then. We went back to his house for a while, and he took a shower. He then fell asleep on the couch...it was so cute! :) His grandma finally called and said we could come over. So we went to his grandma's to swim, but the water was way too cold! We only swam for like 15-20 minutes...we are pansies..lol. Later Drew took me to St. Mary's at about 3 because I had a doctor appointment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=1>After my appointment, my mom and I went to my grandma's for a little while. Then we went to clean the office. I was so tired by the time we were finished. Well when we get home my mom wants to go walking...so we go walking on my road. It was awful. I was so tired. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=1>When we got back from walking I got on the computer and Drew was on! Yayy! So Drew and I talked for a long time. I love talking to Drew..the past few days we have had some really good conversations! :) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=1>Well I am finished with this for tonight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=1>Goodbye!</FONT></P>"

Well I haven't heard from him all week until yesterday because he has no phone service where he is. Somehow he mananged to send me email to tell me he hated it there..lol. He is keeping a journal or something to let me see when he gets back. Ohh and I colored him a picture to give him..haha. We are cool..I know this. His mom also called me to let me know how he was doing. She went up there tonight to stay and they are coming back in the morning. I am so excited.

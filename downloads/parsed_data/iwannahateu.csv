"event","Wow, I am so happy Christmas is over! It was starting to drive me insane. Well I got some pretty cool stuff. And I get to go to Ft. Lauderdale (sp?)! Caroline and me leave tomorrow night! 

Last night Caroline, Dean, and me went to the movies. We saw Ocean's 12. I didn't really care so much for it, but I also didn't see the first one. 

Well today I woke up, brushed my teeth, and Olivia called. She wanted me to go paintballing with her, Dylan, and Zach. I was like I don't know it is way too cold to go. So Zach goes to the place and they say it is way too cold. So we go bowling. The first game I won. And I got some strike. And Zach one too. But Dylan made us get bumpers! But yeah. 

I am so excited for tomorrow, we're going to a Spa! And I am going to dye my hair. And yeah! Oh and my little sister got her ears pierced today, totally cute. Hrmm, I wonder what everyone got for Christmas. Oh on Friday I saw Meet the Fockers! It was so funny. "" ASS- whole "". Mwhahahahha. You have to see that movie. Well I am going to go now and pack, and I hope everyone partys hard on New Years!"

"event","Okay so on Friday I stayed at Molly's house. We had a lot of fun other than the incident with Correy. I don't get why she has to be so mean to molly sometimes, but I guess that is just life. Right now I am at Marshall's party. We went bowling earlier and I got 2 dollars from Mike, from getting a strike and Molly got a dollar and so did Jesse. Tonight I hope I get to go shopping with Molly and Jesse. That would rock. Well yeah tomorrow is Olivia's birthday. She has been hanging out with Ashley a lot and it starting to bother me. I don't think she wants to be best friends anymore, but that's life. I hope it doesn't happen, but I doubt it. Anyways tomorrow I also have to finish my report. Yeah, I hope I can go to Heather's this weekend and then on Saturday is Olivia's party. I think it will be a lot of fun! Well I am going to go now and get off the computer so Molly and Jesse can do some stuff.  And maybe go play Manhunt!

"event","Wow, I had a lot of fun today. I rode with Caroline to Eric's dad's house. It was a lot of fun on the way there. Caroline and I talked about a lot of stuff. She said she can get me a laptop for 300.00 from Nelson. And yeah I will get it in three weeks when Sean and I go down there ( Ft. Lauterdale ) for Winter break. It is going to be saweet! We will be like all going to the mall and crap. And Caroline and I are going to go rollerblading. And I will get to meet Marissa and Josh! Yeah see I was going to go down there tonight so Caroline wouldn't have to drive by herself, but Eric was flipping out so my mom said wait till Christmas. I started to cry. :) I am such a loser. Mitch is going to be coming over tomorrow, and Heather has competition! I hope they win! GO GREYHOUDS!!! They did really good on Halloween. I know they will do good. Yeah so how was your Thanksgivig? I hope good. Sean's birthday is tomorrow. I love that kid, he is so funny! Yeah, today Caroline let me drive her rental car, it was cool. I almost crashed us though. Tee hee hee. It was funny sean was like OH MY GOSH i can not look! I was laughing so hard and then awhen we went to circle k, they tried making me park next to this car and it was backing out so I just went straight and I almost hit the curb. Haha, good times with them! I wanna go paintballing again. Angie, Mike, Sean, and Jonathan are all going to be moving to Colorado, and they're going to get 18 acres and Angie said she is going to open a paintball field, since they don't have one up there, and I told them I was going to be up there every summer helping them! That would be off the chain. Working there and getting to paintball for free. Heck yes! Yeah anywasy I am getting tired because they made me get up early, so I am going to go and watch a movie. Later

Then Cindy pulls a pad out and i went up to hussein and asked him how to use it. he was like i dont know and all of this and armin was like get that tampon away. okay so i walk back to my bus seat and i put ketchup on it. molly was about to puke and we just had to throw it away. it lookd nasty!! Well yeah and then we all went back to school and got to miss 2 periods. At the bell we all ran upstairs and was talking to everyone and then we went ot the 2 floor and went with mrs gioelle.

But oh hes got the brains... dude the shirt i was wearing today.. Everyone was like oh my goodness your boobs are huge, and all this stuff. Yeah and I personally do not think that they are that big. So I asked Omar if my boobs looked like a ""B"" and he said no that they looked like a ""D"". And I told him no and so all day he was like fake boobs. I was like uh no. Yeah that kid is soooooooo funny. Anyways Ashley came home way early because she said she couldn't see. Lame excuse. Yeah, well we had to take her to Lake Howell to  get her car and then we went to Wal-mart. Yeah we were in the baby section forever and then we finally went to the cds and stuff. I got mean girls. Haha... Sometimes I feel as if I am a mean girl and I probably am. I want to break that habit and just be nice to everyone. But oh well. I can't wait till Priscilla's party tomorrow. This is going to be awesome. I hope Olivia is going to go. Well and on Saturday I think we might all go to the movies, so go to Altamonte on Saturday. I think I am going to buy myself some new shoes if we go to the mall, while Priscilla is getting her dress. Priscilla and I were trying to figure out how all of us ( Molly, Jesse, Me, Olivia, Her, Correy, Brittany,) are going to fit in a small car. So maybe COrrey's mom could maybe take us. I don't know. But I want the Lake Howell Fair to come up soon. It is always so much fun at those things. Last year I went with Missy and Kayla. I miss Melissa a lot. I wish we were still alloweeed to hang out: like we used to. I had a lot of good times with her. Well I am going to go and watch Mean Girls, tee hee hee.

"event","In other words, pretty damn well.
I think I have become quite spoiled. Call me crazy but I don't think it's wrong to be paranoid when you don't hear from your special someone for over 24 hrs, especially when the last time that happened it was because he was in the hands of the authorities. It just makes me lonely and feel dependent which is something I don't want to be. As of lately though, I can't be anything but that because I miss my brother a lot. I don't talk about his passing unless someone else brings it up. It only feels real when I think about it and all the good times we won't have anymore. He won't be able to raise my kids for me like he promised, he won't see me graduate from college, he won't be getting crunk with me on my 21st birthday, and he won't be there to ask me to drive him around in my mom's van while he vandalizes the streets of my hometown. This is me being selfish because I've only mentioned the things he's absent from in my life. He also won't be there in the lives of my two favorite midgets in the world, he's not going to live to see others pass before him. I have to that. He gets to be in heaven. He gets to know what it's like, unlike us down here, what it's like not to suffer. That's great right? Well down here I get to deal with the fleshly world and all its unknowns and all the plans I want to make but I'm too afraid of what will happen if I do. I'm afraid of losing something I think is good and not finding something as good or better. It just makes me want to hold tight because if not I'll lose it all. I fee like I should be grateful for what I have and not question it...and I am grateful and I have so many wonderful people in my life right now, but I'm also on a hunt to fill a void and that might not be possible."

"event","so i just realized that i would never acknowldge love even if it stared me in the face and even to this day i would never say that i have ever truly been in love with someone. why? is probably what you are asking. well the answer i gave a good friend of mine was if i acknowledge that its love then there is the chance of losing it and losing &quot;love&quot; is not something i want to do. i get all too sad when i think about losing something as good as love... i mean i know its life, and i know you lose those you love eventually but if i just lose something &quot;good,&quot; something that is a lot like &quot;love&quot; but not necessarily that then im safe. and i've never been one to play it safe, except for when it comes to my heart and i can just lie to myself and make feel a whole lot better in the end or for the meantime. &nbsp;

i need to keep my door open 
i need to not dwell, if i could call it that at all... to not think of the what ifs and instead think of the could bes 

you said your vows and you closed the door, on so many men who could have loved you more 

to say it is one thing but to actually do it is another 

i need someone who will show me and so my door is fucking open!

As fun as it may be while youre are doing it, knowing that you have to leave in the end only makes things worse and learning the truth hurts more.<br />Lesson #2- Jesus thank you for the jams. All the hip hopz and folkz make me feel okay with life.<br />Lesson #3- Working out feels good, do it.<br />Lesson #4-&nbsp;Reading books makes me feel uber accomplished.<br /><br />So... some goals of mine(mind&nbsp;you, not resolutions, but goals)<br />*READ&nbsp;MORE<br />*Pick a schedule for working out<br />*Get sleep<br />Talk to new&nbsp;people<br />*Cook more, food is good, especially when you cook it<br />Do my homework<br />*Have some adventures...road trips, write in a&nbsp;book,&nbsp;go to shows, stay up late&nbsp;and watch the stars...<br />Go&nbsp;to the capitol! I&nbsp;have to for my class I'm pretty excited too =D<br />Plan some badass programs for my girls<br />*pass it&nbsp;on</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I really like this quote and its appropriate sadly.</p><p>&quot;this is love? when you notice someone's absense and hate the absense more than anything? more, even than you love his presence?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>its the stupid fucking distance, im so over it. i have no choice.</p>"

has there ever been a moment in your life when you realized you just were not bored anymore? 
sometimes i feel like there is not enough time to fit everythig into it anymore but it's actually pretty fantastic. between doing ra stuff, working at the coffee shop, goen to classes and playing flag football i swear there is no in between. but seriously it is nothing like home i mean, not that home is a bad thing its just everything is non-stop right now. i seriously thought to myself the whole almost two months ive been here have been filled and not once have i stopped and thought to myself that i was bored so...


So touch me or don&rsquo;t
Just let me know Where you&rsquo;ve been
We could leave it alone,
I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s someone who knows
Where you&rsquo;ve been
You never worked well with our group
Not with the faults we found
So we fixed you with cement galoshes
No one can save you now
Unless you have friends among fish
There&rsquo;ll still be no air to breathe
You could drink up the entire ocean
I&rsquo;ll still find someone to be everything we know that you&rsquo;ll never be"

i arielle kassner am done with high school forever, well almost. ive still got to get my yearbook and have it signed by everyone i love and care about, wear my gown tomorrow, clear and most importantly graduate haha.

anywhoo.... i am up at this very moment, well clearly because i cant sleep and chiefly i have a few things to complain and rant about because this is livejournal ey!

damn oh man i should not have messed with all the bumps on my forehead cause now it looks like i have the chicken pox or somthing haha, hmm there are worse things i could do as rizzo once said. yeah man i hate my skin.

hmmm another reason i am up may be due to the overwhelming anticipation in finding out if i stayed in top ten. im pretty scared about that actually... at one time in my life i didnt care about it because i wasnt even top twenty my sophomore year right???? gah though it is too too stiff this competition of mine and i must admit that it wouldnt matter if i made top ten cause im going to college right? NO, hah i want it so bad actually. me the one who really does not enjoy drawing attention to myself at church because i am a sinner, me who is a shy public speaker. i want that honor, its selfish i guess but it is making me nervous

mainly cause my group crapped out on a final project and who knows what kind of a grade i'll muster in that class now, GAH! i havent let myself think about it all weekend but dayum!
on a lighter note we are getting yearbooks tomorrow ey!

so im going to st eds in the fall jic some of you didnt know by now
i dont know where else to go with this i was thinking about making an awesome end of year post, but those are usually for new years and such.

its the end of the world as we know it
haha and i totally dies laughing cause
memento mori (remember you will die) something like that i wrote in my freshemen letter
and i think thats what i'll go do! read, cause i miss doing that :D"

It scares me a little in a sense.<br />So one of the main things about my dreams is i keep dreaming im pregnant or that i think im pregnant and im scared as hell in the dream. Other things are that theres this one person who kept trying to convince me we had sex and i didnt remember anything becuase i was drunk, but that it didnt hurt or something. And then i was freaked out about being pregnant again. Also in that dream this random guy from Burgess showed up in it and i liked him but had the other guy who i supposedly had sex with hang around in my way.<br />And last nights dream was extremely freaky in the sense that i was pregnant and felt it and it was weird! Like i could feel the child inside me and the swollen belly.<br />I have no idea what to make of this but im tired of having these dreams<br />and i am totally not having sex any time soon.<br />Got any ideas?&nbsp;<br />LOL shelby what does your dream book say about a situation like this?</font></p>"

"event","<p>You guys this year has been amazing i agree with dominique :) Its had its ups and downs yea, i think imma do the short paragraph like shelba and let some pics speak for themselves.<br /><br />So last new years eve i started the year off with EJ! he's a great kid we all love him! Ive watched tons and tons of awesome movies, did OAP and was a crazy convulsing ho on stage. i cant wait for this years :), We said goodbye to some lovely alumni and we miss them so, IM A SENIOR NOW! whoa, theatre has been awesome despite all the crazy new hooligans( i dont mean that in a good way like the movie i came to be obsessed with over a period of time. i think ove eaten a lot more chinese too actually cause of dominique. we've had a couple adventures in the park late at night too. remember the walk home this summer domino? car rides with my two weasel drivers too! elisa and dominique. gotten closer to all my chikas :) met some new people and formed some awesome new friendships. I rode my bike to judsons house one day and we spent the day together. i asked kyle to marry over the summer too i think he's my husband now. HMMMM i was a dr. and a chinese man, cant wait to see whats next~~~ i recently learned this year that im TOP 10 in ma class, i think thats real cool too, a hellavan accomplishment if i may say so myself.oh man my house got robbed that sucked! and hmmm everthing got stolen so i had to start over ive had two cameras and mine broke twice too,,, now you cant see the pictures you take. i got an ipod and its music is love and helps me sleep that thing is so totally coming to college with me. i went without headphones bc of some stupid caca head&nbsp; and i almost died. we've jad a few trips ;) quite more then i planned for at least. Ive been going to church more and i love my gurlies. I really do love God despite everything and i may not agree with everything the church( christian, catholic, ect) stands for but my beliefs are in him and thats what matters. this is turning out to be a long paragraph. its weird how people drift from each other and other people take their place. i cant wait till this year so i can make the most of it in every aspect because there are a lot of new things coming my way..........a big one is college. PEACE To my gurls and Patty and all my invincible jew boys too:D i cant name you all cause it would take too long but all of you are LOVE<br /><br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""PICTURES MHM"">Well these are all obviously out of order, but enjoy loves,,,maybe? and some of them maybe two or three arent mine<br /><br /><br />trash<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/hothearts3094.jpg"" /><br />this was at a jesus thing i went to earlier in the year,,,&nbsp;<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/hothearts3066.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/hothearts3044.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/wethairandstuffs004.jpg"" /><br />i have a couple of these kissy pics<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/arielaho.jpg"" /><br />TASC,, one of em<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/theada.jpg"" /><br />PROM! <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/kalisonmauriceandme.jpg"" /><br />video tech kids!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC00570.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC00449.jpg"" /><br />mwuahahahaha<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01115andsome.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC02304and.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01696.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC02222.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01842.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC02214.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/05-11-2006095000PM.jpg"" /><br />yea boi!&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01552.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01545.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/anythinggoes.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC02437.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/aridomHAWT.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC02142.jpg"" /><br />halloween!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC02193.jpg"" /><br />hah preview for homecoming <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01795.jpg"" /><br />she made me a cake :)<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01788.jpg"" /><br />oooooo he was cool<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01785.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/theada.gif"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/f060b0bc.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/d52c0981.jpg"" /><br />reveille is luv<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/1cd9a3b3.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01607.jpg"" />shhh i found it<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01328.jpg"" />remnents of the flud<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01276.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC01196.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC00978.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c169/Pilot_Darko/DSC00972.jpg"" /><br />el paso died this summer just alittle bit...

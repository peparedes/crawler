"event","<P>well i never got to write about my awesome weekend. i saw&nbsp;<FONT color=#33ccff><U>OSCAR</U></FONT> on saturday, it was great. we just went to busch and spent the afternoon by ourselves. it was our first weekend just by ourselves, it was great. we just walked around and watched all the shows, since we never saw any of them. we went to the mind over magic thingy and umm that thing was umm retarded. we were just laughin at it cuz it didn't make any sense. it was really great seeing him since we hadn't seen eachother in like 2 weeks. </P>
<P>then yesterday i went to sinta's house in kiln creek to go trick or treating with the kids. my little brother got alot of candy, the people in kiln creek gave out real candy not the lil snack sized ones. it was hot. but yea i think that was all about sunday. not too much happened. </P>
<P>umm today i started behind the wheel. umm i didn't think i was that bad of a driver until she started talking about it... maybe its just cause i'm not used to the car yet. i seem to drift to the right alot. i don't kno why. and i zoned out a couple times. i def need to work on that. i just don't like the car that we're using cuz its just big compared to my car.and the gas peddle is so damn sensitive every time i pressed on it the car would jerk. pissed me off. but yea i think i suck at driving at this point. it will get better tho. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>You are a <B>XSIG</B>--Expressive Sentimental Intellectual Giver. This makes you a <B>Teddy Bear</B>.<BR><BR>Hee! I just want to give you a big squeeze. You are tender, honest, generous and fair. You are an excellent kisser and a sensitive, communicative lover, and you know it. You would never intentionally hurt someone's feelings or overstep his/her boundaries. You have beautiful eyes. <BR><BR>Most people take your laid-back attitude, blazing wit and subtle sexiness and stick you in ""friend."" But some see your extreme hotness for what it is and latch on. This means you have a few members of your target sex in the bank at all times -- I call this ""money in the sex bank"" -- but you're too sensitive and thoughtful to exploit them. More than once. <BR><BR>You are so rational and deliberate in an argument that it can frustrate and exhaust your partner. Your fights can take forever, but your press on with them until they are completely resolved and both you and your partner are satisfied. If your partner is weak of will, s/he may just give in -- be wary of this! An emotional or passive-aggressive outburst later will hurt and horrify you. <BR><BR>It is *critically important* that you are able to respect your partner. The moment you lose respect for him/her, you lose everything. <BR><BR>When you make friends, you make them for life -- you can go without speaking to a friend for years and pick up right where you left off. You are completely faithful, both physically and emotionally. You are the second best (to XPIG) parent of any type. <BR><BR>If you are male, you have a huge shlong.

"event","k well yesterday was a boring day. cleaned up in the morning and took a morning nap, then talked to <b>oscar</b> for a lil. i was supposed to go to the mall with felix and jonathan so i could see wut they're gonna wear to homecoming but they never called so i went to my aunts house instead. lots of food. so yea i ate, and we were watchin cold mountain. it was a good movie. in the middle of the movie jaron* called, very upsetting. told me things i didn't wanna hear and basically made me wanna cry. i hate when he calls out of no where. he only calls like once a month just to see how i'm doin and the convo always ends up with me being upset. then came home and talked to <b>oscar</b>. then went to bed. 

* for the people that don't kno who jaron is... first and only black guy i've ever dated. broke up with me twice and next day ended up with another girl. THE NEXT DAY!after the second time me and him broke up i told him straight up that i would NEVER go back out with him just to avoid getting hurt again. he would ask me out pretty much every day and always got the same answer...no. one time he practically begged me. it was funny. everytime he called me he would always tell me he loved me and at one point i did, but why would he have hurt me if he ""loved"" me. he ended up moving to portsmouth back with his mom and for awhile he stopped calling so i pretty much started to stop thinking about him and moving on. but everytime i start to forget about him he always calls. and tells me that we'll be together again or some other bs. when he called last night it was a complete surprise and it was weird because i kinda forgot about him. but of course he basically told me the same old bull that he used to and he said he meant it. sure he did. i told him that i have a boyfriend and that nothing will happen between me and him (jaron) ever again. he needs to stop calling me. 

k i'm done.

Didn't have to go to church&nbsp;since i went to mass last night. so i chilled then at 11:50 went and picked up my lil bro at sunday school. then went to texas roadhouse and met up nini, kris and their fam. i couldn't eat my real meal cuz i ate too much of the appetizers. but i brought it home... mmm yumm mashed potatoes. it was so boring but i decided to text <FONT color=#33ccff>oscar</FONT> so we were talkin thru that for awhile. :-D so that pretty much made my day. and the texts from later in the day made it so much better. :blush face:</P>
<P>then after i went ot the mall and got my <FONT color=#ff6666>pretty pink jacket</FONT>. oh its gorgeous. its on my pics page under random... lol. OH YEA and yesterday. i got some <FONT color=#cc33cc>glasses</FONT> from work. i call them my super star bug eyes. they're hot u have to see them. lol.</P>

"event","<P>so yea, yesterday i went to busch. 10-10 long ass time. but it was fun. :) chilled with the church. i thought it would be pretty lame but it was fun. chilled with joamarie most of the time. rode some rides. then we had mass (it was youth catholic day at busch.) me and jo were just basically patiently waiting for the bruton football game to be over so adam and <STRONG><EM>oscar</EM></STRONG> would hurry up and see us. they got there around 6:30. :)got on the haunted train thing. that thing was lame. then met up with becky and nate at the smoke house after. then we all went to the haunted house near the festhouse (yea i can't spell) lol i was like running thru that i was soo scared. lol got hit in the face with like tons of stuff. i'm glad <STRONG><EM>oscar</EM></STRONG> was there. :) </P>
<P>but yea i'm just gonna type out the anger i had at one point. yesterday was supposed to be a group activity. unity within the youth group. don't think that since u were with your girlfriend that u can wander off and do u'r own thing. thats so rude and it pissed me off. me and jo were there with guys but u didn't see us leaving the rest of the group. if we're goin one way u should suck it up even u don't want to and just go with us. don't whine about where u want to go. u ruined the mood in the group and i was really close to screaming. u shouldn't ruin a group thing just so u could be happy. u have to learn to compromise. the world doesn't revolove around u. u made urself look like an <U>ass</U>. </P>
<P>k thats all :)</P>"

"event","yea well i guess i'm not talking to anyone anymore. :sad face: it sucks bad cuz i mean it is the right thing for now but it just doesn't feel right at all. he probbaly thinks i'm a complete bitch even tho he says that he's fine with it and everything... i hate myself for it. but my head is completely just screwed up and i don't want to stress him with that. i hate that i assume that all guys are the same way and will just end up hurting me. i thought jaron was different... asshole broke my heart. so u kno i'm just takin wut i'm used to and dealing with it now. and gus is right. not all guys are the same and i should get used to that idea. i mean i should just put my guard down, u kno, cuz maybe this time it won't turn out so bad. but i'm just scared. cuz if he won't hurt me... i'll hurt myself. not in a phsical way... more mental and emotional kind of way. i just need to get my head on straight and until then no seriousness. i don't want to risk anyone hating me anymore than now. i'm just gonna wait til december. i got three months to straighten up and work on my outlook on things. hopefully he'll still want me in three months. if not i'll just be forced to live with my mistakes."

ugh and then people at work!!! customers come up to us askin us how much something is when all they have to do is freakin flip the damn shit over and the price is <b>RIGHT THERE!</b> they're staring RIGHT AT IT! and they come up to us and are like ""how much is this"" <b>WTF? ITS RIGHT THERE!</b> i mean i admit some of them don't have prices on it but FOR REAL fuckin look! ugh its so annoying. and oh ""umm do u take the vouchers here"".... umm this is water country and it IS merchandise and u'r <i>IN</i> a store and the stuff in it is considered merchandise...hmmm i dunno if u use it here? ugh freakin dummiessssssss!!! 

ok but enough of that frustration. while i was workin today sarah m told me that we have roxy swimsuits in the stock room for <b>$9.99</b> each for the bottom and top! omg i love my new swim suit. its so pretty its light orange and yellow. i'll take a pic of it and put it up herr. sometime later."

"event","me and nate hung out and watched a movie ""alien vs predator"" yea i never heard of it either. i saw chris from summer school there. :-D after the movie i talked to him for a lil then went to go walk in the rain. if i wasn't wearin new shoes or new jeans i would've jumped in every puddle. theres something about the rain that reminds me of my childhood. i don't kno why. hope it rains at work cuz i think i wanna play in it. i don't kno wut i'm gonna do about tomorrow. :-/

oh yea and eww on the way home jaron called like three times...i ignored every one of them and then i think the second one i like opened and closed it, so maybe he'll get the hint that i don't want to talk to him but my dumbass didn't close the phone all the way... i don't think i talked about him that time. lol 

well i'm kinda bored and tired so i'm just gonna lie down and listen to the afi cd that nate let me borrow."

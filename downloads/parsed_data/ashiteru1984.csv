Like my icon, isn't he cute?

Anyway, school's been out for a week.  Thank goodness!  I pulled two all-nighters this semester, isn't that nice?  Sense the sarcasm...  I must say I was very worried about what grades I would get this semester, but it turned out to be really good.

<b>InDesign Advanced</b> - B
<b>Flash Basic</b> - B
<b>Drawing I</b> - A
<b>Illustrator</b> - A

Aren't ya proud of me?

A big congratulations go out to my sister who graduated this past Thursday with high honors!

I am very proud of myself cause I learned how to join a community <lj user=""30_kisses""> and I posted a request in for Yuki Sohma and Tohru Honda from Fruits Basket.  Don't be mad at me Tohru/Kyo fans, but I really do think there is something between Yuki and Tohru and so, I am going to write about it.

Well, that's it for now.  I swear I'm gonna fall asleep on my keyboard.

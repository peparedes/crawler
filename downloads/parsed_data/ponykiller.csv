Blood and gore is always a plus and that predator guy is so cool lookin with his freaky mask an his like I dunno gory habits of sitting on towers and beheading people then putting his spear in the air and waving it around, letting lightning get into it and electricuting him. ultra hardcore. Anyways if youre still reading this youre probably like wtf. But yeah I wanna see aliens vers predator. And I havent gone 'ballin in a while maybe that's the source of my bored/sadness. I dont see the point though all I've wanted to do was start a team and there arent even tournoments held here cause no one plays cause it's 'too expensive' which I guess it is but I dont care you should play anyways.

And tomorrow I get to make my headache worse by going to change my class(hopefully) or I'll just have wasted time goign to the office and figuring that I couldnt change to driver's ed cauwse I a too late or some bullshit.

The most open minded of all metal genres. You have<br>no problem with breaking down in the middle of<br>a song with a Xylophone Solo if the song calls<br>for it. You also usualyl incorporate more then<br>one vocal style in your music, which makes for<br>a good change every once in a while, so you're<br>also one of the best sounding of the genres.

I dont know yet though. it's impossible to get a hold of my dad, that issue really pisses the shit out of me but it makes my dad mad at me cause I never contact him. he's a real bitch about being in contact it's really gay. Egh. like call him every week to check up on stuff. it's like OH HEY WHAT DID YOU DO THIS WEEK?
I played computer games till 4-6 every day then slept till 5 pm. how about you?
oh, I went to work and this weekend I had another kinky episode of sex on my boat with my girlfriend. 
oh lovely. 
   I'm not angry at my dad that's just the way he is. I'm no angry at my mom that's just the way she is. I get caught in the middle. I knw that sounds soooo typical to get 'caught in the middle' but it's so true. And I'm not gonna decide to live here or there, cause people expect me there and here. So I dont give a flying fuck. woah I rambled a bit there. I wonder if anyone will actually read it this far. or godforbid comment. 

   So I went paintballing yesterday with weiss and rags. lands. and I guess we had an okay time. MY mom played with us and she did better than any of us. ( i have an excuse I was using shitty assed paint that was like two weeks old that ruined my day. I cleaned out my gun thouroghly today and cleaned out the already dirty brand new ball detent that has a stripped screw the first day I got it. lol. But let's see here Oh I got an MRI scan today it reminded me of that movie where jackie chan was in it. Or jet li. yeah it was jet li and he went in it and his evil twin from another dimensin tried to kill him inside th e mri tube it was badass. but yeah. they wanted to inject metallic dye in me but my mom declined so I was like GODDAMIT FUCKSTICSMhg aieduhgif. Cause I duno that sounded like the coolest thing ever to get injected in me. I'd be like METAL MAN. or boy. boyish man. manish boy. whatever.

That was for a day then like 3 days in london with my mom. I saw all the stuff. And I pretty much know how to get around there now. via  the 'tubes' (underground train you cunt). and like I saw the 'stuff' (the huge fucking ferris wheel, that one palace where they have the guards I forgot the name I'll remember it in a minute. and big ben and the tower of london. I want to go back there. It'd be 1890751386906754269075412694 more fun if I had went with any friends.

"event","yep so what teh fuck is wrong with my Inty explorer, it just RANDOMLY FUCKING CLOSES TE pAge. k. 

So like I woke up, my mom made me go to the place of snobs, the golf club resturaunt. It sucked ass I got my right to have long hair violated by some asshole in a desk. He told me that 'If I wanted to stay in this nice resturaunt I'd have to get that..hair out of my eyes, or get out' What a fucking wanker. I swear to god, What difference does it make how much the asshole in the table next to me paid for his little shit rueben sandiwch, or fish taco, you cock sucker. The thing taht really pissed me off is that if I had been PAYINg for my shitty disquisting over priced overrated meal, He'd left me alone. Cock sucker. 

   Then, another social..distaster.... my mom invites her stupid-arsed hairy friends to the party, and this bitch happens to have a son the same age as me (not as cool as me however) like, all he does is surf and ask girls out, what a boring existence. So like my mom mentioned my precious p-ballin device and like they started askin questions about my beloved sport, and i was like uh yeah no I dont play in the fucking woods OMFG WHY DO PEOPLE THINK WE PLAY IN HTE FUCkinG WOODS. so like then this sydney lady asked if her son could go with us sometime. (of course he really doesnt want to) but you can tell she thinks I have social problems (IE the long hair, aqua shirt with pink stripes, whatnot etc etc) so she's like MAYBE BRYCE COULD GO WITH U SOMEtimE. I'm like thinking oh okay whatever, so then she was like OH IF HE ISNT GOING SURFING. <that was his backup plan in case he didnt want to play paintball with the psycho-agressive cool kid. How fucking lame. i mean seriously, first of all wench I dont have a social problem with people I get along with people that I give a shit about, obviously not you bitch. Yeah. 

on a brighter note, I picked up my precious marker today, it's inside o-rings hav been dealt with lavishly, it doesnt leak out the reg, it's quieter, more accurate, blah blah blah, and I hgot a stainless steel hammer, and OH LOve A FANG TRIGGER <3 It shoots fast as fuck. 

oh my mom bought a LIVe lobster, I took a few pics of it theyre lovely (not with my digi cam, which I lsot likea  moron that I am) 

-farewell till later."

"event","What an eventful weekend...I wish I had my digi cam but FUCk where'd it go...but oh well so like my brother rickert has some wierd fucking friends, they are the most perverted, immature group of people I've ever seen. This one kid named jacob was up all night trying to make this halluciogenic drug out of bananas. I helped him, and I have a baggy of it in my pocket. I dont want to smoke it though smoking freaks me out for some reason, I hate smoking it's so gay but anyways. Then this fucking fat-assed kid named chase wouldnt SHUT THE FUCK UP the whole night his voice is sooooooooo fucking annoying I'll kik his ass I swear to fucking god and he kept picking up my gun and playing with it I was like GET  THE  FUCK OOF MY GUN YOU PIECE  OF FAT SHIT. so like yeah they stayed up all night and lit fireworks inside my mom's furnature and for fucking finally my mom noticed that they were up to no good and gave them a little lecture about respect of people's property, banned them from the house, and then took me rickert and this cool mexican kid named antonio to the paintball place. Rickert and the mexi-kid went airsofting. I went paintballing for somee of the day, I only played like 2 or 3 rounds, but soon I got sick of playing with fuckin nubs that shoot me and I'm on their own team. So I unloaded a few rounds on my own team then pissoed off to the airsofters, cocky and loud as ever, asking them all if I can borrow one of their gunz. It was pretty nice, I got to use the little mexican kid's m4. However, I played a bunch of airsoft, and I realized why rickert refuses to play paintball is because...IT HURTS TOO MUCH THE FUCKING PANSY. However, I have lost all fear of getting shot, I am now the most aggressive person I've ever seen my age. So yeah airsoft sucks, I cant even feel it when I get shot, I went all badass with 2 pistols and like ran down the field and didnt go out cause I didnt feel any of em hitting me. it was pretty coo. 

  then my mom kidnapped us and went to her friend's house in LA. I have no idea what that was for but we stayed the night there and went to some public pool with my mom, the kids, my mom's friend and her two hott hott daughters that were..cheerleaders. I hate cheerleaders all they talk about is being tan, and boys. So I was generally really quiet around them, and I sounded likE i was shy or something, but the fact was that I didnt give a flying fuck what they were tlaking about it was so gay. So yeah then my mom took us to my grandma's house and I thought about how old people die. She isnt gunna die anytime soon, but it makes you think. so my mom drove us back here, it's 11.15 and my mom told me to go to sleep an hour ago I think I will soon. 


I love you goodnite."

"event","I need to stop getting in fights with my mom lol. I cant help it though she's just so fucking stupid. like I was sittin the computer and it was like 10 30. And she was like GET TO BED. I mean what the fuck I stayed up till 3 the past 2 nights what the fuck so like then she wigs out about this passport thing, saying I broke a promise that I was suposed so bring it here. And she wont stop bitching about it. I have no rights because I dont want to lose my passport here. NEways. I just watched this movie called Gacy. Pretty wierd. And then I watched the last half of Big Fish. Ive seen it like 3 times now. I cried at the end of it I have no idea why, but it was li ke the third time Ive seen it and I never got anything the last 2 times I saw it. pretty dam wierd. It's not even a sad ending, it's happy why the fuck was I crying. Egh. It made me think about my own parents. My mom has heart problems. She's half crazy, and thinks that people are bugging her. So her own dilusions will kill her one day. I'm really scared she'll kill herself or something. And most the time I'm so pissed off at her that I'll tell her to go kill herself. Then I think later that she'll take it seriously and that I'm her oldest son talking to her like that. It's all because she's being an ass about everything, and no one see's what I'm talking about, they just think I'm a testasterone-imbalanced 15 yr old. Which isnt true, my mom is seriously...ill or something it's really fukin gay. Help me lol."

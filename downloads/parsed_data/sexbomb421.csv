Uconn played NC State. that was an interesting game, i was rooting for Uconn btu felt guilty cuz it was against my school. but i've loved uconn basketball for years and years.. cant replace that. plus they are just awesome! uconn beat state by 14 pts :) whoohoo! they didnt play to well either. Went easy on State. well they are missing Shea Ralph and Svetlana. but didn thold them back too much.. 
neways.. i had to drive my mom to the airport @ 5:30 this morning!! arg. i am sooo exhausted. :p we stayed up late too... and today is my hardest day. 4 classes. i have a paper due wed and an exam wed and a project plus a test on friday. and possibly a psych test thursday. im soo dead.. this week is gonna be hell. i work tuesday nite and then not till fri afternoon. i hope i make it thru the week. im going to a hurricanes game friday nite! :) i love hockey! then Raleigh Relays are this weekend here @ state. i wish some of my friends from home were competing. :( but nope. ohwell. 
Heather wrote me a  really cruel email. took her logn enough. i've held back writing to her. ive written her letters but didnt send them. it made me cry. i cant beleive the studd she said. she has no heart. what a bitch. :(
ohwell. i got better friends than her.

"event","tomorows friday. which means the next day is Sat. and my mom flies in Sat. morning. i cant wait to see her. this week seemed to drag on and on... :p
i have a quiz tomorow in ans horses. still havent studied. im such a slacker. i was just tired from work. made no money once again :( sucks. its been so dead at work lately. :( i really need money. especially after last week. i spent/lost so much money. and a friend. :( ohwell. the mexicans @ work were hitting on me tonite. i dont speak a word of spanish so Gabe had to transfer everything. they asked me if i liked mexicans?heh.
neways... still going thru some innerturmoil (did i spell that rite?).. about lots of stuff.. guys. i dont know what to do. i've gotten so used to my single life now. i dont know whether its i'm scared or what. i have had alot of bad breakups over the past year. but i'm over most of them. well ya'll know getting over Jon has been a process... until i find someone to replace him in my heart he'll always be taking up that space. 
i dont know if i could be in a serious relationship.. i am real busy with classes and work. i wouldnt have the time to see someone everyday... i no longer have the *need* to be with someone like i used too. i'm content on my own. but i could be missing out.. who knows, maybe i should give someofthe guys i've been asked out by a chance. i'm too cautious and picky.. ok i'll stop now cuz i do have to study at some point tonite. i slept thru my classes today. i went to jillians last nite with Vonnie, Mickey, Erin, and Lisa. it was alrite. nothing special. danced with Ryan and Zappo... no comment there. i wasnt in the clubbin mood. but i had some beers and whisky so had a good buzz going on. ;) once again didnt pick up any guys @ the club.. havent yet this year. ohwell...
i'm going to the Bon Jovi concert! with Jess and some people from work :) yea!

see that was him jumping on the keys. =)
neways.. i'm just stalling.. as usual. i dont wanna do my webassign for chem. that would require work. im too tired to look up stuff. :p
oh i worked tonite. 4-11. made $20. yes that sux!
blaaaa. oh well. only burst into tears once @ work. just about anything will set me off now.. 
i'm just still depressed over Heather. i just miss her. i blocked her on aol so i cant talk to her. still debating whether or not to write to her... :(...... ugh. doesnt help i have pics of us up in my room. ohwell. treat it like a breakup with a bf. i guess
neways! happier topic. my mom flies in sat morning for the weekend!! i cant wait to see her. i have been real homesick these past 2 weeks. i want this semester to hurry up and get done with.. well part of me does.. at the same time i dont wanna go home.. my parents are divorcing at the moment.. still. its been due for a long time.. so its no surprise to me. now i just have to deal with the crap that comes with it. we are prolly gonna have to sell the house. which breaks my heart. i love that house. i'm not a materialistic person but that house means alot to me. theland its on has been in our family for over 300 yrs. my cousins live next door. and 2 aunts 2 doors down. plus the gorgeous RISLEY resevior across the st and the land.. etc... 
thats the only home i've ever known. before college that is. and going home to somewhere else. another house with only one parent in it.. it will just be strange. like i dont belong somewhere. ok i'm getting upset so i will stop now. i hate this.
i swear i mite have bipolar disorder. i keep on switching from being depressed and sad to being happy. before break i was soo happy. nothing could bring me down. everything was perfect. and now.. its all come crashing down... but it can only go back up.. i suppose. we'll see. i'm used to being sad neways. so dont worry about me. i know how to deal with it.
well i'm gonna attempt this webassign then get some sleep before another busy day tomorow.

"event","arg. i have a paper due tonite.. i havent started writing it yet. i'm so dead. its only the rough draft but still. i gotta write some bullshit by 6:00 tonite. i did alot of reading and research last nite for it. i cant beleive my teacher made it due the day after spring break. thats so mean. :p like she relaly expected us to work on it over break. actually i could have if i had known Tony was bringing his computer. but i didnt and it hasnt been worked on at all. i worked 6 hours yesterday. had money lost (again) somehow..:( my life keeps on getting better and better. the whole time @ work i was so sad. i ended up crying alot. coudlnt help it.. as busy as i was my mind kept slipping back to the past week... heather and all. i wish i could just be pissed off and hate her.. i am mad that i lost all that money and my stuff. it just hurrts to lose a friend liek that. to be treatewd that way. i really dont know what was wrong with her.. i cant understand how you can treat someone who u claim to be your *best Friend* in such a way. i could never do that.. especially if my friend had doen all that i had done for her. now maybe im missing something here... i dont recall doing anything or being mad/short/snappy with her. i pretty much was just the same ole D. i was considerate and treated her like a guest. didnt mind paying for dinner and getting into clubs and such. i didnt mind treatig her. but it seemed the nicer i was to her the meaner she was to me. never said thankyou. just complained. and then when i asked for her to pay for something... for herself she bitched.. and bitched and bitched....
the first day she was here.. instead of paying me back for the plane ticket that I bought... she gets her nails done. how vain is that. i'm sorry im bitching.. this is therepy for me ya know.. you've prolly all noticed this by now..  just dont know what to do. i got stuck with HER parkign ticket when she was driving MY friends car. as i was packing up my stuff, ya know as she was yelling/screaming at me ""bitch, cunt!"" etc... i kinda blocked it thru my tears.. she puts the ticket in my purse. so thats more money that i dont have.... im mailing her mother the receipt for it. and her mom actually had the nerve to call me and tell me to mail heatehrs stuff home. liek i have that money. she will get her f***ing slippers and crap when i get my money and clothes and the rest of the stuff she stole from me. 
:( i don tknwo what to do.. this is gonna keep bothering me and eating at me... normally with any friend if we have a little fight or whatever i am always the one to back down and make up.. not this. not here. i have better friends than her. obviously. i didnt deserve to be treated like that. shit. :( 
ok well i guess i will do soem more research now.. i have lab in 20 mins neways.. so thats leves me 3 hours to write this paper before class. wish me luck.."

"event","so go ahead ask me about my spring break.. i dare ya too...
definitly wasn't what i expected.. i learned a harsh lesson. losing a friend is sadder and harder than losing a boyfriend...
yea so my (ex) best friend Heather flew down here for Spring Break. i was really excited about seeing her and going to Myrtle Beach together. ended up being a nightmare. i cried everyday. i don't recall her saying one kind word to me the whole week. i bent over backwards for her. bought her plane ticket, fronted money, bought food and liquor.. everything. never once do i think she said thank you or offered anything. borrowed/TOOK my stuff. w/o asking. now i think i'm pretty generous and shares well with others. i dont mind lending out my clothes and stuff. but she seemed to think everything of mine was hers for the taking. ruined a favorite shirt of mine, didnt say sorry.. bitched at me for EVERYTHING! swore at me constantly. pissed off every one of my friends. i had to calm everyone down and convince them to let her stay. almost got in a fight with them. was rude to everyone! had a constant attitude. made me cry. why am i such a pushover... i'm too damn nice. i shoulda left her ass in myrtle and gone to florida midweek like i was tempted too. well i did finally leave thursday. ran into Ross and the golf team thursday nite and spent the remaining time with Ross ;)
 i just could not take it another second. to much drama and stress and tension. i got so depressed... but i'm back @ school in my dorm room. very happy and content to be here. 
i lost a best friend. people change after high school. i grew up and built a new life for myself down here, 1000 miles away. i dont know if heather was jealous of my life and happiness.. it was a collision of worlds. she always has to be the center of attention and a princess and selfish. that doesnt fit the definition of a friend to me. 
i have plenty of good friends. Nikki, Amy, Kimmi, Allison, Angel, and all the AGGIES back home will always be there for me. and i've made wonderful friends at college.. kinda worried about one of them but i'll see.. i dont know what to do now.
it is alot like breaking up with a boyfriend. you still have the pictures up and the memories. but the very thought of that person makes you angry or makes u cry.. 100 times stronger when its a friend.... ohwell. just move on. learn a lesson.

"event","well today was nice. i didnt get outta bed till 12:30. slept thru my 2 classes. oops. my alarm didnt wake me up and Margaux didnt call me... so i didnt get up. ohwell. ive been real good. only missed those classes once so far. last semester it was a diff story. never made it to Bio. i cant believe i passes that class.. hmmm. neways. so i worked 4-9. made NO MONEY!!! sucked. but it was fun as usual. guess its worth it. there's just way toooo many people that work there now. they need to stop hiring people.. seriously. i mean i like everyone that works there. love em all. great bunch of people. but i need to actually make some money. i would go somewhere else but 
1. no car 2. i love my job
ya know... ohwell. 
what can u do. i cant believe spring break is almost here. this semester is flying by. way tooo fast.. Heather comes down Friday. unless it snows too much then sat (hopefully). we're going with a bunch of people from work. they rented a cottage. its gonna be packed but lotsa fun. 

i talked to Carly for forever tonite on the phone. she was down here in NC for the past few days. wish we coulda gotten together but it was still nice to talk to her. we talked alot about Jon. got me to thinking about him again. i hadnt in a while. well reallly thought about him :(  i still miss him. its been so long since i talked to him or saw him. it would still be hard. but i dont know. i just wonder how he is. it seemed everything that could have possibly gonewrong did all at once. :( i wish i could have been there more for him. but it was too hard after the way things ended. ya know.. so many times i've just wanted to call him or write to him. but i know what he'd say or not say. but then again how will i ever know... if it's been this long and i still care about him and have these feelings.. maybe that says something. i'd like to someday.. but it mite be better to just let it go.. we've moved on in our seperate lives. i'm so far away now in school. and he's got his life and his gf Stacy. i only wish him the best. all i can do is ""tip my hat to her"" like he did to shaun. :( ohwell. someday i'll stop missing him. doubt if i will ever stop loving him though. he'll always be in my heart. sorry if i am going on about him. i dont know who reads this, you may not know him or the story, but maybe you've been thru something like this and know how it is to regret and miss someone so much your heart aches. im just afraid i'll never find anyone that made me feel that way. he was my best friend, made my heart smile. he completed me. the very thought of him made me soo incredibly happy. i loved him so much. oh man, here it all comes. ""everything's changed except for the way i feel about you..."" i have a 1000 songs that remind me of him. perhaps i shoudl delete them but i think there's something wrong with me that makes me want to cry over him still. i still have pictures up of him in my collages of photos, and still sleep with the tiger he gave me. still think of him everytime a red ford 150 goes by thats rusted over. or see to be able to relate to every sad country song. maybe he's the reason i got a thing for cowboys. i admired him.. as stubborn as he was and couldnt swallow his pride.. he was an individual. he's changed though. from what i know he's not the same ole Jon... he's changed. i dont see how he couldnt have with the stuff he went thru. but deep down.. maybe if i tell him all this. the old Jon will hear me. but i gotta face reality. and its unlikely he'll ever read this or i'll find the heart to tell him. he doesnt need me mixing things up for him nemore. ""whats meant to be will be"". i just hope he isnt what he seems to be. i hope i didnt really throw away the best thing to ever happen to me... ohwell. i just gotta hold fast to my memories. nothing will ever erase those....
 neways..seems like everything has gone downhill since i stopped running. i've gained weight. :( hardly ever work out. i get to the gym once a week now.. i ran 20 mins last week. :( i miss it so much. but i just dont have time. with work and school. i do study more this semester and have barely any spare time now that i work. and i must have a social life. :) ya know.. neways.. i will try to get back into running this summer and maybe do cross-country. i do miss it but i have other things to fill up that time. and i gotta face it that i'll never be a awesome runner. i was good in high school. -varsity, all conference, captain, and all that jazz. and here @ state: its a whole diff story. i cant compete with the team. heck half of them are all-americans and we were ACC Champs this year. i know i could work my ass off and maybe have a chance next year of competing but realistically i could never be at their level. :( but i loved cross-country this year. heck i wouldnt of made all my friends i have if it wasnt for it and being an athlete and all. otherwise i prolly wouldnt of met all my friends :) 
well i'm gonna try to go to bed. dotn know if i will be able to fall asleep cuz of the xtra sleep i got last nite. :) 
well sweet dreams

"event","this week has been a week from hell. exam in every class. midterm or 2. 2 papers. plus work. i'm ready to die. well at least tomorow is friday. actually its after midnite so i guess it already is. :) i got my exam in 9 hours. hope i'll do okay. this semester is so much harder. plus balancing work.. and still trying to run. man, i miss running so much. it was such a big part of my life for so long. 7 years. and now.. its strange not running and dealing with the problems that come with it. (umm a bit of weight gain). but im trying to get back into it. i ran today. only 20 mins. plus 20 on the running machine @ the gym. to think last semester i was running 70 miles a week. and now.. a few days a week. i still dont know if i'll do crosscountry. as much as i miss running.. i dont miss having to go to practice everyday. dont get me wrong i loved my team. i found my best friends here thru it and all my other friends from being an athlete. but having my afternoons free to do as i please.. study, work, relax, and run on my own. neways... i'll see what kind of shape i'm in come this fall. 
i miss home. its even harder now that i went home last weekend. its not that bad but i wish sometimes i was a little closer to home. maybe i should have gone to Uconn. be 20 mins from my house. but my life wouldnt have changed in the way it has. being far away and so independent has made me grow up and change. i'm just me @ college. ya know what i mean.. well i really should get to bed now. and get up early to study a bit more. Goodnite..

BUT i ended not having to work cuz it was gonna be slow and my manager is very understanding and told me to go study. he's so nice! i love my work. so much better than my last boss. Lester. he was so hard to work for. made me cry too. but i did love that job. i got to play with animals all day. who wouldnt love to walk around with a parrot on their shoulders. :) ohwell.. so  now im gonna study for my midterm tonite and relax!! i forgot what that was... hopefully going to the club tonite with kristy (from work) but im not sure yet. depends on if im in the mood. i've been feeling kinda rundown. ohwell.

but i just dont enjoy myself like i used too. maybe its becuz im not looking for a guy o=rite now. but that was never it. well i did kinda give up on that.. but grrrr. nevermind. so i didnt have muchfun. disappointing. Although Ross and Margaux and like 20 people i knew showed up after awhile so it got better. but not much, blahh. perhaps its becuz i've just been depressed lately. kinda homesick. luckiy i go home this weekend :).
the last time i had been at jillians was that time i went with Tyler and all the soccor boys for the first time. ehh.. neways. not gonna think back on that nite. 
oh well. but im still thinking about Jon and that makes me sad. oops i mentioned him. damnit. i try soo hard not to think abotuhim or talk about him anymore.. but everyoncein awhile i falter back. i still miss him so much. ( yes we broke up over a year ago officially but it was around this time last year that we had a kinda ""affair"") or however u wanna put it. but i was kinda with him atthis time and things ended bad.. etc...im pathetic. and ever sinc ei hurt him i have been hurt repeeatadly. every guy has managed to burn me. so thats why i dont want a relatioship. im sick of having my heart broken and scarred. so thats why Danielle is still single. i dont want anymore empty promises.
ok im gona go to bed now before i get sad more. i go home fridaay morning1!!!!! thats something to look forwardf to.!! yea :)

they are tori amos lyrics and quotes. i used to be obsessed with her... not nemore. but she's still one of my favorite artists and her music means alot to me. if you are a fellow toriphile/earswithfeet then you know what i'm talking about if not then it probably just seems like nonsense. but i suggest you go download a few of her songs and listen to the words.. :)
here's a link to a great website:

here's the lyrics to whats playing rite now:
Baker Baker

 Baker Baker baking a cake make me a day make me whole again and I wonder what's in a day what's in your cake this time
 I guess you head he's gone to LA he says that behind my eyes I'm hiding and he tells me I pushed him away that my hearts been hard to find
 here there must be something here there must be something here here
 Baker Baker can you explain if truly his heart was made of icing and I wonder how mine could taste maybe we could change his mind
 I know you're late for your next parade you came to make sure that I'm not running well I ran from him in all kinds of ways guess it was his turn this time
 time thought I'd made friends with time thought we'd be flying maybe not this time
 Baker Baker baking a cake make me a day make me whole again and I wonder if he's ok if you see him say hi"

"event","So I've not posted in quite a while and this post shal in itself not be much. What do you guys think of the Coutry Crock family? I was noticing today that their commercials have slowly built this family over the past few years. I remember when I was fairly young the commercial was the guy and his wife having breakfast when she artfully tells him that she's eating for two. Now it seems that the family has in addition to the kid I remember added yet one more. Now as to what any of this has to do with anything else is a vaild question. Let me simply add then that I am becoming increasingly anoyed when products attempt to link themselve with sweet family moments. Now, some products can and rightly should link themselves to the family. Afterall, who doesn't remember what brand of gun cleaner their father used? Butter, however, is one of those things that's the same no matter who made it and noone is going to notice when momma brings home Lando'Lakes or Kroger instead.
 Now, I'm begining to wonder how many people ever come accross my little journal here. So, if you even have nothing to say if you could post something even if it's just ""hey yo."" I'm interested in seeing how many people still monitor LJ at all."

"event","So I finally got to use my telescope last night :) It weighs two tons but it's worth it once you finally carry it outside. Unfortunately, I couldn't convince an observing partner to adventure with me yesterday so i was limited to my backyard for observations.
 Unfortunately I have a neighbor who is for whatever reason terrified that someone will sneak up to his house. To this end he has placed a massive motion sensor spotlight at the edge of his fence line. This wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for his tiny dog which everytime the light goes off simply has to run and hop infront of it ensuring that not only is the light blinding but that it occasionally blinks!
 It took me a long time to align the mirrors and adjust the spotter in the dark, but once I finally had it all set it was time for a tuning shot. Unfortunately, last night was a moonless night. The moon is rising really late these days so i had to find something else to aim for. Knowing only one other object that would be easily visible I took aim at the sword of Orion. Suddenly, and to my utter shock, the eather spray of the Orion Nebula came into view! It was a little washed out by the lights of the city, but one could still easily tell what it was. I jumped for joy a little.
 So I repositioned and began searching for Gemeni. Finally finding it I dropped down to just above the tree line. As I slid along the horizon I found the object I was searching for and the rings of Saturn danced into my view. It was just as lovely as I recalled and made me wish for a moment that it was July so I could turn to Jupiter next. I would have turned next to Andromeda but the sky was simply too bright to spot something so remote. Let us close with Batty's qupte, ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe..."""

"event","Greetings, 
and you thought I was dead ;)

 Unfortunately for you I have returned once more to bore you with my antics. I recieved notice from Celestron that my new scope will not arrive until Febuary :( most sad. I suppose this is the price that I pay for getting something half off though. It should still be here in time for some viewing this spring even if I miss prime Saturn viewing time. Stay on the look out for Titan this week though it should be visible even through a 60mm. My 60, however, will probbaly fail to show it because of its inferior optics :( Anyway, if the sky should clear.
  This might be a good time to mention that my subject has nothing to do with my post, I just saw one on television and had to spread the word! Now to continue with this aimless meandering, day time television becomes trashier every day! I actaully just heard a Spanish small claims court judge, on one of those fake judge shows of course, say, ""You're one taco short of a combination plate.""
  Some of you may be wondering why I've been so dodgy as of late. This of course is my own business. I am currently engaged in a growing legal dispute which is also my business. I also seem to have been poisoned in some way, which explaines my randomly missing various classes.
  Okay, so today's real question is what I should use as my new magician name. I'm thinking, ""The Incredible Trevor"" but I'm open to any suggestion.
  Don't get mad cow!"

"event","Last night around 3:25 I was returning to Macon from Atlanta. As I turned off of the interstate, my front left tire decided to spontaneously fail. The rapid loss of pressuer send me into a flat skid barreling sideways for a curb. I knew that my Jeep would certainly flip when it hit the curb, as it was already on two wheels. I quickly turned into the skid, jumped the curb and blew out the tire.
  So now, I'm stuck by the side of the road it's 3:30, I have a spare tire, but my jack sucks. I call my friend Logan, one of my few real friends it seems. Logan is horrified by my predicament and quickly offers to drive from Atlanta to assist me. Tempted as I am to accept his kind offer, I know that it's not one I can reasonably ask, besides, I have lots of friends at Mercer who will certainly be willing to drive to Riverside to pick me up or help me change a tire.
  First, I call my cousin Jack. Certainly my cousin will come to my coaid! ""ring.......ring.......ring"" no answer. I decide to call Kellen, certainly Kellen will come save me! I call him ""ring.........ring.........ring......ring.......ring"" no answer. Well I'll call my room-mate Jacob! Certainly a room-mate will come to my aid! ""ring..........ring..........ring...... hello?"" Yes! I was overjoyed at last help was coming to me! ""Dude, I've just been in a wreck, will you come and get me."" He responds, ""Yeah man, where are you?"" I tell him and he dashes off! So I'm standing here in the freezing wind awaiting the arrival of Jacob. Twenty minutes later the phone rings, ""Dude, my car won't start.""
But that's alright, I still have more friends! So I call Jeff, my room-mate since freshman year. My self proclaimed ""buddy"" whose always asking me for favors and such. He answers, and I say, ""Dude, I've just been in a wreck will you come help me out!"" He responds with, ""I don't have access to my car right now, I'm at (someone's) house. Can you call someone else!"" By this point I'm getting rather flustered! I would have dropped a date with a supermodel chess master to go save these guys! I think of calling John knowing that he at least will come stand next to me and moan about how cold it is, but remember that he is out of town. So I call Loretta. I don't really know Loretta that well, but I assumed, foolishly, that people were like me and anyone that called them at 3 in the morning needing some assistance would recieve it! She agrees to come get me and to call me when she gets close. After about 25 minutes she calls back and asks if I can call someone else. 
 At this point, Logan, my true friend, calls me and asks once more if he can come and get me. I tell him that that's crazy and that I'll just try to use a compressed glue air can to fix it. I walk, in the cold, in a coat and tie, to the BP. As I enter the clerk dares to ask if I'm having a good day. When he sees the fix-a-flat and the tie he immediately says, ""I guess you're day's not so hot."" Turns out there was a massive hole in my tire so the fix a flat did absolutely nothing beneficial.
 Finally, I'm just lonely and really need someone to have some pity on me. I call Cheyenne, who doesn't answer. After another twenty minutes or so, I call her again and this time recieve a text message which says simply, ""Bloody Hell."" I text her that I've been in a wreck and she immediately calls and comes to get me. I don't really know where she was but it took her quite a long time to appear, well at least it seemed that way because it was freezing cold and I was alone in the dark by the side of the highway. Finally, she shows up with a flashlight and I beign trying to jack up my jeep to change the tire. My lame jack fails and nearly drops the vehichle on me. So it's off to wal-mart. I purchase a set of screw drives to remove my hubcap and a replacement jack. This second jack works fine until it become jammed underneatht the vehichle, in order to get it un-jammed I was forced to break it. Therefore, it was back to wal-mart for yet another jack! Finally, I concluded that there was simply no way that I was going to raise the vehichle high enough without blocks of some sort, so it was time to admit defeat and call home.
 Cheyenne sat with me all night and helped me fight against my failing car, the weather, and my own ill temper. Logan was always on hand and willing to assist me. The rest of you guys, except maybe those who didn't answer their phone are just lame! Jacob, is maybe not quite so lame, his car at least didn't work, he merely lacked the creativity to find a path around this obstruction. Jeff, was simply not a friend. Loretta, I don't really blame, she didn't know me that well, but I will accuse her of being kind of evil. If she'd called me I would have gone to get her.
 So, for the next few days I'm going to be re-evaluating my friendships with you guys, if I run up and break your nose or decorate your room with profain sayings in ducktape you'll know how I feel about you. When someone calls for help, you help them, I don't care if you're busy. I would have come to help anyone who asked me! Those of you specifically mentioned for hatred here, however, I will probably never assist! I guess I really would rather be alone all the time than be friends with people who act the way I've seen folks act over the past few hours. I returned to campus this morning at around 9:45. I owe this entirely to my family, and the only friend whose ever really given a (use your favorite here) about me. If you feel bad about abandoning me by the side of the road, you probably should!"

"event","If you've known me for any ammount of time, then you know I obsess over two things above all other, proper etiquett and tea. Unfortunately, today's topic will not be so exciting as how to properly lay out a dinner table, today I must bemoan the state of tea in the U.S.
 I whine today of Bigelow's Vanilla Chai. Now on the surface this sounds like a brilliant idea, combine all the wonders that are Chai with all the wonders of vanilla into a single wonderful beautiful symphony of flavor. This, however, is not what has happened! Instead of my beatiful dance of taste and scent, I am given only a dull flat drink with no back-bone. A good chai served black should taste almost of chocolate and pepper, instead this tastes more like Bigelow's wattery Earl Grey. Now I do love their Earl Grey, which is a tea sometimes brewed too strong. Grey is a delicate tea, which must be brewed to the perfect place, else it will break. Chai, however, should be brewed strong and hard. It should be diluted with gasoline! It should never be described as weak, s'pecially when served black as is my custom.
 Perhaps it is Bigelow's corporate policy that is to blame for this most unfortunate of teas. Perhaps their quest to provide flavors matched to the ""American"" pallet just cannot satisfy the buds of a long time tea fanatic. I cry to say this, but it seems that the best of grocery store teas t this particular moment in history are made by Tazo teas. Tazo as you well know is the official tea of that most evil of shops ""StarBucks"", but I suppose not even I can compete with the simplicity that they offer. A tea in a bag which tastes like one I could make myself from a porper spice set and a good assam. I just hope that the flawless Earl Grey metropolitan that comes to me from the ""old country"" arrives before I lose my mind utterly!"

"event","Well it seems that there is a place where lonely folks gather on a rainy night. A place where those who have nowhere else to be appear to warm each other's hearts. That place, most venerated, is the student center study lounge.
 Last Friday I met an attractive young woman there who was frantically studying for some sort of poly sci exam. As I walked to my mailbox, I noted the way her eyes followed me. This emboldened my frail spirit into speaking with her. Thus I did approach her and make my announcement that there are only two types of people who go to the student center to study, those who are escaping from a horrid room-mate and those who wish to be interrupted.
 I suppose it was to be interrupted that I went there this evening. Hoping that if I sat in the open and studied someone interesting would happen along. A most depressing prospect, but I suppose even our whimsical God occasionally blesses us with a fortutious occurence. When I arrived I heard blessed music. The delicate notes wafting through the abandoned lounge. That mysterious older gentleman who hangs around campus sometimes was playing the piano. O' bliss, he did play it wil fingers rather skilled. Though I cannot say that his style was perfect, or dare I say even better than average, it was to me on this night as the very breath of the universe.
 I knew not the piece which he played that moved my weakened spirit. A rolling piece with a violent accompniament! The music ran as thunder and waves mixing all the beauty of Heaven with the passion of Hell. I sat there as long as I dared, piece after piece, note after note. Every so often he would lift his head and look back at me. In those moments I looked down, pretending to be pre-occupied and perhaps even annoyed, yet I was with him. Though I hope he did not realize it. A man is most at ease when he does what he loves alone, I suppose I wanted to see him alone, and yet not destroy the beauty of his moments. I sat holding my own useless hands, whith fingers that long so do act as his, yet never shall. I stayed as long as I dared. Ms. Ard eventually came to ask what I was doing, I know she did not understand when I explained. How could anyone else know. As he played I felt my spirit stir, I felt my heart leap as it has not in some time. I felt like I was for one more moment warm."

 View 1- I've always thought it would be really cool if I were related to a pirate or something. Unfortunately, pirates always fail to produce many offspring, but it turns out that there was a Shurling who was a sea captain sometime in the mid 1800s. Now that's pretty neat, but what I find even neater is that this same man was Irish. Now that's just plain cool.

 View 2- I always wanted to be related to someone either cool or famous. There was a Webb, my other line, who was a crusader. To this Crusading Sir. Webb our family crest was issued by Queen Elizabeth 1st of England. Having a family crest is cooler, but this man's granddaughter is far cooler than any other human being who has ever lived.

Mr. Shakespeare, unfortunately, never made much money so when he died he was able to leave his son William only very little land. So ha, people top that William Shakespeare is my cousin."

 A.A healthy six-figure salary, a solid 401k plan and a nice car.
 B.A PhD
 C.A book of T.S. Eliot poems in his or her back pocket
 D.A totally hot bod.

And to satisfy my own curiosity you must also answer why.

"event","O' great spirit of air conditioning, I apologize for all of my transgressions. I regret my use of the heretical fan instead of coming to thee directly with my problems. I weep that the EPA has banned thy most ancient and wonderful freon because it ""destroyed the planet"". I have not been recently to thy holy land, Trane, or worshiped in the temple of thy glory, Sears. Please I pray restore to me the cool breezes that once blew through my car, my home, my mother's car and the home of she who has wandered farthest from the sacred land of thy birth. In the name of the almighty chiller, temp hold.

 In other news, it seems that all air conditioners that I come close to suddenly fail.

"event","So I had this dream the other day. In my dream, I was working for this british company that for some reason had to video congested traffic. My crew and I were assigned to Paris, which makes me wonder why it so particularly had to be a British company, and to the area around the Arch de Triumph. Really, my job was simple. I was supposed to drive around and around the circle there until traffic became so congested that it stopped. I would then jump out of the car and video the traffic. When it started moving again I would dive back into the car and speed off.
 We were doing this one day when we stopped for a regular video session. Suddenly, some moron started shooting! Our driver became terrified and tried to speed away. The other fellow with the video camera and I were horrified and began chasing after the car pounding on the windows trying to get in. Finally the car stopped and we began berating the driver for trying to leave us. We insulted him many times before the other passenger finally shouted, ""Freaking STEVE!"" At which point I woke up.
Anyone else have strange dreams lately?"

"event","I know someone will say it, but I'm not crazy. MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED! But let me start at the beginning. Note: names herein have been changed to protect the guilty.
 I was standing at work talking with this girl, let's let her name be Wyoming. When she decided that it would be amusing to place me on speaker phone while a certain, let's call her Ms. Jaq, was listening. So, I'm singing along because little Wyoming told me to entertain myself while she spoke with Ms. Jaq. I'm singing ""Fare Thee Well Enniskillen"" which is a song of battle and heroic deeds, the sort of song that I typically stand around singing. Just as I'm getting to the good part of the song, I realize that I'm not hearing a debate on the other end. ALACK! It was in that moment that I realized I had been placed on a speaker phone. TERROR!!!!! Well actually it wasn't that scary. What does one even do in that situation? Alas, I know not. I'm not sure whether it was luck or misfortune which intervened and brought Travis to speak with me.
 When I returned home this morning, I intended to get a few hours sleep. I say a few because I knew that I was expected to be ready to depart at the ninth hour. Ms. Wyo is doubtlessly wondering how I managed to get so little sleep, but I found it utterly impossible to sleep once I disconnected.
 Around Five, I heard a strange gurgling sound. I naturally went to investigate and discovered the toilet to be over flowing. After some searching about, I discovered the secret location of the plunger, and began plunging. Now, this particular type of toilet or perhaps just this toilet in particular, has a feature which prevents excess pressure from building up and damaging the pipes. This feature causes water to be vented, or in the real world spread all over the floor like a puddle. I fix the toilet and begin attacking the puddle. I began plunging, and due to the increased pressure of the plunging, causing water to be vented all over the floor. Somewhere in the midst of this, the plunger decided to break! This unfortunate turn of event sent me questing after another, which I to my amazement found we actually possessed. After an hour or so, I had both the toilet itself and the puddle on the floor handled. Which is when I discovered that the chain inside the tank was broken! I therefore decided to abandon the project and wash my hands. When I washed my hands, I discovered that the bloody drain was clogged! After a little liquid plumber I believe I have handled the drain, but does it not seem strange that so man things would malfunction in one evening?"

"event","So I was out at the o'l plant yesterevening driving my front end loader. Now the loader felt a little more rickety than usual, and since it usually feels rather rickety I thought nothing much of it. I loaded for a while and was preparing to kick back for a pleasent evening of Irish music and semi sleep, when I suddenly felt that I had forgotten something. I tried to put down this crazy feeling, but it was no use. Once my mind had decided that there was something it had forgotten, there wa no way of telling it otherwise. I typically park the loader very near the building so that I won't have to walk so far in order to begin operating it, but this time it seemed completely reasonable to drive it a little distance from the building before climbing down.
 I went inside to confer with my co-workers about what exactly it was I had forgotten. When we decided that it was nothing and that I was just being crazy, again, I went back to to the loader. What a sight did I there behold! A towering inferno some 12 feet in the air. The cab of the machine had exploded and was being consumed in a blaze driven by burning rubber and diesel vapor. A close call indeed!"

"event","So I bring you two stories to which my subject line can be the only response.

1. I journeyed with Cody earlier to a local fuel station. Cody wanted to pay inside in cash, as opposed to using a card, because the place offered a 3 cent discount per gallon if you paid in cash. Anyway, as I was checking out the fine gift section of the gas station, which included such things as plastic figures of dancing girls, knives, and lottery tickets, when I overheard one of the attendants chatting with his co-worker. This I overheard, ""Man, they're taking pornographic pictures at my house right now and I'm not there!"" He then proceeded to repeat this several times before hanging up his telephone. Now, I would have been intrigued, but I took the time to examine the hairstyle of the man in question. It is easy to tell what sort of woman would associate with a man based on his hairstyle, dress code, and deportment. Since this man had an oily looking mullet, we must assume that the girl in question was a heavy smoker. Since I could not see his shoes, I am unable to make any judgment based on them. Instead, I will say that his accent was thick and sloppy, which is how the man kept himself. After further debating this issue in my mind, I decided to simply laugh and walk out. I do, however, wonder what the heck the man was talking about?

2. So my father told me this one, but it's still a good one. He was in a large meeting with several other men, discussing contingency plans. For those of you who aren't familier with deep southern phrases and sayings, the phrase "" That won't geehauw"" is similar in meaning to the phrase, ""That dog won't hunt"" which means simply, ""That won't work."" Anyway, my father says, ""What will we do if this doesn't geehauw."" He then looked across the table at an Indian man who looked extremely nervous. FInally the man ask, ""Did the just say Jihad? My father told me that whenever someone yells Jihad to run!"""

"event","So I went shopping today, bleh, and had one heck of a stupid time. It all began at Lense Crafters where I typically go to have my eyes fitted for contacts. Now, I should mention that I am now begining to approach the level of disability where I'll require alot of special work in order to see. Keeping this in mind, after my exam I was told that the  rapidly failing health of my eyes required a switch to the new more breathable high oxygen contacts. So I'm fitted and walk out, all excited about being able to see and not worry about having my eyes rot out. A few minutes later, I began to realize that I couldn't see anything. I mean I could see to walk around and such, but as far as being able to read sighns or see people's faces, I could see practically nothing. So I decided that it was probably just the new contacts and that I wasn't acclimated to them yet. A few hours later, however, I was begining to become quite terrified. Since one of my hobbies is precision riflery, I was most upset at being unable to see long distances. I finally became angry enough to go back to the ocularists. There, they finally admitted that no contact was made in my rx. So I asked what could be done and was given the lense size above what I was wearing. I can now see like a hawk, much better than 20/20. I am, however, still left to wonder why she didn't simply tell me that she wasn't giving me my proper contact to begin with?
 In other news, I bought a shoe. Now the one or two of you who know me, know that I am picky about shoes. I was quite fortunate this time. I entered the shop, extended my foot, said, ""Give me two of these"", was given a box, and walked out. I NOW HAVE THE EXACT SAME SHOE!!!!! YAY!!!!!"

"event","So the SKS is acting up again. The firing pin is now stuck in the forward position, which means that should the bolt close, any live rounds in the chamber will fire. As the rifle is semi, it would in effect become an out of control fully automatic rifle of doom. This is naturally most undesirable as well as unsafe. Tomorrow the soaking in brake cleaner begins, as well as the acquisition of another bolt.
 In other news, my vacation request was approved at the mine, so for a week or so after July 4th, very few people will hear from me. Actually, I think it's fairly safe to say that I will be quite difficult to find and few people will take the time.
 The little hamlet in which I live become ever more and more strange. Today, I dined at the local fine eatery, ""The Wing Shack"", and had a twenty minute conversation with this strange old man about the weather. He, of course, was naturally interested in it, as are all old men, whereas I was simply happy for someone to speak with. I think he is perhaps a relative of the woman who randomly approached me in Wal-Mart to say that Jesus loved me and that she was just trying to spread his love. Indeed, such things would drive a lesser man to lunacy. A man such as myself, however, is certainly immune to further infection by a malady from which he already suffers. That he is."

"event","So today, being filled with a boredom which had no equal, I decided to adventure for my weapon. I tried first the local gun/pawn shop right down the road from the plant where I work. BINGO! I walked in and found the fellow who runs the place chatting away with a wirey little man. I asked if he had any Samozaryadnyi Karabin sistemi Simonova rifles. This of course, only earned me a blank stare. I tried once again, ""Do you have any SKS."" This time, I recieved far better results. He quickly produced what he claimed was a Yugo SKS, though I remain convinced that it is Russian, ro at the very least a highbridization as the lock clearly states that it is a product of the Georgian Republic.
 As I examined my favorite of weapons, I noticed the wormy little man looking at me. He seemed extremely interested in what I intended to do with my little SKS, so as my background check was being performed, he decided to inquire. I responded that I was merely looking for a quality medium range medium power rifle that would allow me the magazine capacity for personal defense, as well as the range and power for game in closer quarters such as the Georgian woods often provide. He seemed satisfied and departed. When the owner finally returned he seemed extremely relieved and sighed as he said, ""That was the man from the ATF. He was here today to inspect how I sell firearms."" So great, the one time I go to buy a gun the ATF shows up, just my luck, lol. Good thing I have nothing to hide.
 The gun is a late model Yugo, so it was packed in cosmoline at the factory to prevent it from rusting in long term storage. Cosmoline is now my mortal enemy. It is in every moving part of this gun and there is seemingly no way to remove it! I spent several hours today stripping the gun apart and putting it back together in attempts to remove all of this vile substance, but it seems that nothing short of a complete strip down and a nice soak in mineral spirits or brake cleaner will remove all of this darn grease:("

I am quickly realizing that there is little if anything to do in this microscopic little town. It's quite interesting to work with absolutely no one in your own age bracket. Everyone I work with, even the other summer help guys, have several children, though not all of them legitimate. It just seems that I'm becoming a bit isolated. It's a little lonely and disheartening to know that when I do have a day off I will spend it utterly alone sitting in this house, but then I've never minded being alone before.

I was delighted to discover that my plan includes free nights and weekends, night being defined as 9:01 PM- 5:59 AM. With this happy knowledge in mind I danced to the sports supply store. There I discovered a massive clearance sale! Who can turn down a sports sale? I found a wonderful telescope there which normally sold for around $100 for a mere $30! How could I resist?

"event","""Dude, you're getting a Dell!"" Dude, you're getting a pain in the neck. Now granted I've never had any hardware problems with my Dell lappy, but to be sure it has had some hard times as of late. I somehow once more managed to damage internet explorer. For those of you who haven't noticed, IE is now an integrated part of the Windows operating system. That means that it is nearly impossible to correct any problems with it. So, for a few days, due to my own carelessness in leaving my recovery package at home, I was forced to operate under a Linux distribution. I must say, I will be switching all non-gaming activities to Linux.
 ""Dude our solder jobs suck""
 Jacob's laptop died a few months ago. He, wisely, sent it off to dell to be repaired, but they refused to work on the power mount plug which is where the problem is located. He, therefore, was forced to buy a new machine. Recently, however, I have become obsessed with the possibility that I could repair it. I have therefore spent the last few days with the machine torn apart on the floor of my room. The problem, as I predicted, is a bad solder on the power mount. I spent all day searching for a soldering iron, which I must say is about as hard to find at a liberal arts college as an atheist is to find at seminary."

I come to you this evening with the woes of a mad man. I would have waited a while yet for a post, but a certain someone.... ROBBY.... sent me a ""nudge"" saying that I must post. First, I would like to talk about nudges.
  Does not the term ""nudge"" itself seem a bit suggestive? I mean on Facebook ""poke"" is bad enough, but I don't think anyone has ever used ""nudge"" in a non-suggestive way in my presence. If you mean by nudge, ""To get someone's attention, esp.: through the implementation of the elbow,"" then perhaps it's clean. I personally just find it a strange term. In whatever sense you choose to take it, thanks for the nudge;).
  I wanted to post a poem tonight, but I realized that 99% of my poems are sappy, poorly written, or very long. Then I remembered that I'd just been to see a movie about cigarettes, and that reminded me of something that happened a long long time ago. Many moons ago, I was stuck in traffic. As I sat there, trying to think about almost anything besides how much I wanted to be elsewhere, I happened to look at the car parked next to me. Inside sat this rather attractive young lady puffing away on a cigarette. Now mind you I've never found that at all attractive, but the moment did spur me into thinking that it would be terribly interesting if I did. So then I completely forgot about the whole event. A few months later, I was staring at the sun trying to figure out what I would do that day, so I decided that it might be fun to try to live life as someone else for a while. Enter my alter ego. So while I was experimenting with this whole thing I thought back to the girl in the car and wrote this little poem, which though I don't really like it, has a certain appeal at this particular moment. The errors in grammar were for artistic purposes:

She smoked a pack of cheap cigarettes
Blowin out smoke and whisperin regrets

Draggin her shoes down the road
Crying in rain storms
Kicking up dust
Out of the mud 

A smoke breathing beauty


  In other news, do you think it's reasonable to say that a place only exists because you are there? For as I was laying on the couch earlier pretending to be asleep, I was pondering back onto this field that I happened across one Saturday afternoon. I thought for a moment that it would be interesting to go back and see it once more, so that I could compare the way that it is stored in my mind with the actual appearance of the place. Then I wondered whether or not it would be there at all, because certainly if I found the place and it did not look the same I would never believe that I was in the same place. My emotions on that day shaped it in my mind and I would certainly never feel exactly the same again. I've tried to capture my thoughts on the subject with this poem, though I'm sure it's overly sympathetic and all the other crap that I'm always shouting at people. This is very beta, I just wanted to update with it before I forgot about it.

Out there
	Amidst that sea of stars
	Where all of our yesterdays
	Melt into one
	
	Floats a point of light
	Where the twine of our pasts meet
	The glow where the gentle twist begins
	To wind twine into rope
	
	A place too sacred to exist
	An autumn day, and a sky
	That in memory alone 
	Makes me yearn for it
	
	I tried to find it again
	Our little field along that dirt road
	But I must say
	I have forgotten
	
	The path that we took
	Was so winding
	That it could never be found again
	But I do not care
	
	That place exited
	Only while we were there
	For in itself, it was but a field
	But when drawn upon
	
	By human hearts
	It became something more
	A place too sacred to remain
	To remain hidden along a country road.

  My friends I bid you a good evening, though if you've read through all of this I should perhaps worry that you approach to claim my life. Good morning, afternoon, or evening."

Rice cooker at Walmart $20, Soy Sauce at Publix 3$, Imitation Crab at Publix 4$, Rice at Kroger 4$, Rice Vinegar at Walmart 2$, Seaweed at Walmart 3$, Avocado at Publix 1$, making your own sushi priceless. Indeed it was a very long day of questing to gain all the necessary things, but in the end it was most defiantly worth the effort. Some days it's a good day to die some days it's a good day to eat sushi.
 In other news I've been playing a lot of chess lately. Chess is a contained battlefield, it cultivates the mind the spirit and the soul, and we must always cultivate the soul. Now I know that many of you consider chess nothing more than a game, or at best a battle of wits, but I contend that when played with the proper opponent, chess is a special linking of minds. It is like fencing, an expression of passion, of love, hate, and fear. I've been writing a poem on the subject, perhaps I'll post it soon. But that's probably far too romantic a way to think of chess.
 Well I suppose I'll close with what is perhaps the geekiest analogy ever. These days my life has been like a low altitude hyperspace fold, you never know where it'll take you. Perhaps though we are opening the Chamber of Gaf, the door to the beginning and the end. I think though that, in the words of Arthur C. Clark's Dave Bowman, ""Something wonderful is going to happen..."""

"event","As I drove home in the dark tonight, I had a little time to think, which is always dangerous. Along the way I had two trains of thought which I felt would make interesting subjects for a post, interesting to me at least. The first thought was based on two accusations of cowardice which were leveled at me earlier, and the second in the fine tradition of randomness on the movie ""Blade Runner."" 
(1) 
I've always been an incessant worrier, but I wonder now if what I sometimes consider prudence is in fact cowardice? I don't take strong opinions on many issues, because to be quite honest, most of the things that people worry about are truly unimportant. For example, my roommates are quite concerned over this new fellow who could be potentially moving in with us. While I am not overly pleased with the possibility of living with someone I have never met, I truly do not much care what happens. I just want to minimize drama. I suppose I've never been one to worry about the little things in life. Accusing me of taking any side whatsoever in this discussion is nuts since I simply want whatever maximizes the happiness level in my dorm room to occur. I suppose then that it is not cowardly to keep my opinions on such things to my self simply because discussing them is not worthwhile. 
I read a poster once which broke down the topics which both great and weak minds discuss, ""Weak minds discuss people, average minds discuss events, great minds discuss ideas."" We see then that idle gossip is the most base topic of conversation. Since that is what was discussed today, I had no real desire to become involved. This still, to me, does not seem cowardly. 

(2) 
""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...""(Blade Runner). 

In the cinematic masterpiece the last of the homunculus muses on the loss of his memories as he prepares for his impending death. When we die all of our memories are lost to the world. There is no longer any evidence that those moments occurred. While few of us can claim to have seen any sights as strange as those which the machine man saw, we do each carry with us at least a few memories which we share with no one else. How many have seen the dark emerge from beneath the trees and climb their backs, but have been too distracted by the way that the setting sun plays off of the sparkling eyes of an absolutely breathtaking young lady to realize how dark the walk back is going to be? I wonder then, when we are both gone and the memory of the event passed out of the world, does that mean that it never happened? 
For even when we attempt to record our memories, we're never able to get it right. Paintings cannot record the feeling of the wind, nor the cold of the shadow. Poetry gives us our best hope, yet still falls terribly short of truly recording a moment. I sit here at my desk and notice that there are no photographs anywhere in my room. The picture frame on my dresser has a stock photo, and the one on my shelf contains a copy of a painting of Dante. The photograph, after all, can never capture the essence of the moment. Even moments of intense heartache and pain are important, for without them one could not be certain what true bliss felt like. Let us then keep our memories alive, live them again daily and do whatever we can to insure that they are not lost until we ourselves are.

"event","In the spirit of the New Year I have decided to share a two of my favorite adventures from the previous year. Well I guess they're not my favorite adventures, but they are definitely two that few or none of you have heard about before.

""The First Adventure-
 I have but one true adventure, and it's probably not that interesting, but I enjoy it. I apparently have a distant uncle who has somehow escaped my notice for his entire life. Anyway, this year my aunt decided that as a super fun family Christmas game we would draw names from a hat and you get that person the wackiest gift you can imagine. I got a cousin and gave him a bag massager, it seemed wacky to me. So this uncle gives me a gift card to FYE, which is in it self not strange, unless you know me. For what music do I listen to which FYE would sell? Despite this, I head out to cash my gift card. As I roamed the store, which isn't that much room to wander, I suddenly heard a scuffle. ""You don't know who you're *freaking* dealing with,"" shouts this giant man. My dear reader you may be certain that when I describe someone as giant, they truly are. Then this tiny, the shortest of the short, girl who is apparently the manager steps up and shouts back, ""Oh yea, well you don't know who you're *freaking* dealing with either. I'll call security and they'll pitch your ass out!"" So eventually, security shows up and chases the guy down the hall with the store alarm blaring. Later as I talked to the girl who had battled the man, I discovered that all of this was for two R-Kelly CDs. I amazingly know who that is and, having heard at least one of his songs before, wonder why the man bothered. He could have just as easily found one or twenty copies of the same CD in the garbage.

The Second Adventure-
 This one is a bit strange, but I'm certain that at least one of you will recognize my position. Early one Saturday morning several months ago, I left Macon in a dense fog. I remember the morning distinctly since I was supposed to leave the previous afternoon, but we all know how certain distractions can creep into one's life and inspire one to linger watching old movies and wandering campus, that was a fun evening. The next morning, as I drove through the fog, I decided to take the most direct route home, through the forests. It was there that I encountered the first strange sight of the day. There in the middle of the road lay three large black dogs. Lab mixes most likely, but I must say that they had about them the very look of the dog which portends doom. I blew the air horn several times, but the hounds would not be moved. Instead, they stood slowly and stared at me as they swaggered back into the forest. I put the dogs aside and journeyed on, for I was late for the festival. I put the dogs out of my mind, until I passed the cemetery on my way back. There lay three dogs, almost exactly the same, atop a grave. I didn't find out until later that day that my grandmother had died. Pretty strange eh?

Thus concluded the adventures of Sir Richard. He retired and went into the west where he became a little known story teller who ultimately tripped over his own feet and fell into a pit out of which he could not climb.""
 I thought the ending was quite suitable, since I certainly wouldn't want someone else to come along and write a spurious second part to the adventures of Sir Richard. Remember though, the adventures themselves are true."

"event","Now I shall relate to you a few of my adventures as of late. For you see o' my beloved readers that I have not actually been slain by dragons, as has been reported in so many circles. I have simply been engaged in that most barbarous of activities, the mass production of essays and papers. To this end I have kept myself from sleep for two nights now and must confess that the hallucinations are beginning to manifest themselves. Why earlier this very evening I imagined that my roommate, who need not be named, came walking by in his idiotic bicycling outfit. Now I have told him on many occasions that this outfit is ridiculous to wear when indoors and only makes him look even more annoying than that horrid bicycle of his sounds. O' wait, that wasn't a hallucination! It actually happened! ahhh. But, I digress from my primary point which I seem to have forgotten somewhere along the way.
  I suppose the time has come for me to ponder my feelings about the end of the semester and our rapidly approaching holiday. While I always enjoy Christmas as a time with the family and away from school, I find myself fairly reluctant to move back home. Many of you I'm sure would argue that I don't really live here to begin with, but in truth I spend more time here than I do at home. Oh well, I attribute most of my mental wanderings and this strange feeling of paranoia which I have developed to my exhaustion."

 My more distant readers have no doubt assumed that I have fallen victim to some accident. Let me assure these poor confused individuals that I still live. I have, as of late, found a more interesting way to occupy the time in which I typically wrote these semi-worthless little posts. Also, I have begun keeping an offline journal under heavy encryption, perhaps some day I will let some of you read segments from it. I would also like to apologize to everyone who has had to put up with my weird moods this week. I suppose I can attribute some of it to complete mental exhaustion, but the rest I must simply call weakness of spirit. The source of this melancholy I must say is quite embarrassing, as it is utterly contrary to my philosophy of life. I was for a moment deluded into believing that school was intended to make me a more employable person. This belief, however, I have abandoned and re-settle firmly on the fact that the only things in life of any importance are the people who journey with us. Sorry, I don't have a whole lot to contribute today."

"event","I've been having some interesting thoughts on the subject of sleep, well at least I find them interesting. A few years ago I would have said that sleep was a waste of time. In high school I almost never slept, except as a result of burnout or the so called Yuppie flue. When I came to the university, however, I found that many people are actually addicted to sleep. What I mean to say is that when they get bored they nap, even in mid-afternoon. Now I'm a big fan of sleeping when you're tired, a nap in the afternoon after spending all night inside some ancient and arcane tome is certainly acceptable, but some people seem to just sleep. Last semester I was always pressed to find a place to study because my roommate would be asleep in the middle of the day. In normal standard human style housing this would not have been a problem, but our room was anything but standard human style housing. Anyway, I guess I've come to terms with this little addiction because as my sign proudly states, ""Sleep is for the week"". I'm sure all of my fellow non-sleepers will agree when I say that the problem with insomnia is not the lack of sleep, it's the over abundance of awakenings."

"event","Well I've decided that I will make a serious post, a rarity for this journal I know. Today was the annual Kaolin Festival, which for those who are thinking, ""What the devil is Kaolin,"" is the mineral which enables my tiny little home town to survive and is used primarily to make paper white and or glossy, think National Geographic. Anyway, I was terribly shocked when during the parade the float for my church came down the road. I long ago spoke of what I call ""church punks"" and I'm certain that you have all seen these people they are the sort who would on the average Saturday night be leaning against a wall opening and closing a knife behind a veil of smoke. So these terribly dodgy individuals decided that they were extremely religious and joined my church's youth group. Now, I'm always in favor of someone finding religion, but these people show no improvement. So anyhow, they're on the float wearing all black jackets, except for one fellow who was wearing a camouflage jacket. I, standing on the ground, was shocked by their blatant disrespect for our older members. All they had to do was dress nicely and wave at the people, but no! They decided to dress like criminals and just sort of stand there chatting amongst themselves. I know this post makes me seem a bit evil, but had you seen these people you would have been outraged, I mean really who wears a camo jacket to a church function of any sort?"

Anyhow, today's true thought is about Bonanza that greatest of T.V. shows. Did anyone ever notice that the shows follow a really predictable plot line? Little Joe always gets in trouble, which is quite often amplified by the presence of Hoss. On occasion Adam will do something rather pointless somewhere between Little Joe's problem and the final act, but he's usually out of town. Then Mr. Cartwright, is that how they spelled it, would come and overwhealm all of their foes with his greatness. Just seekin some thoughts?"

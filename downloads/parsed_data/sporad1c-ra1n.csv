"event","i never ever write in this shit but i figured i should give some sort of an update.&nbsp; this year has been totally insane. ive gone through boys the way i do my trashy romance novels. it seemed like i could never really find someone that i clicked with. someone who didn't annoy me to the max and wasn't clingy.&nbsp; i think.&nbsp; ive found that someone now. James is just like me in alot of ways. we click really well and im happier now since ive been with him then i was before.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

school wise ive been a bad bad girl.&nbsp; i skip it way too often and when i do go i never get any work done unless im working on a client. it's not that the work bors me, it's just that i hate working on my doll and the stupid rules that the managment keeps making.&nbsp; like if you're a minute late you get an absent day/15$ fee. not cool.&nbsp; im pretty much almost done tho.&nbsp; probably like 200 or less hours left. it should go by fast. i still love the cosmetology profession tho.&nbsp; so if anyone needs their hair cut or dyed let me know. 

work. oh jeez how i dislike it. stupid fucking target.&nbsp; either you're getting yelled at for not taking a break or not showing up when the break schedule differs from the one the manager has.&nbsp;&nbsp; im so close to being fired i swear. yet they haven't done it yet.&nbsp; i hope i don't tho cuz ive got too much debt w/my dad.&nbsp; i hit a dear a couple weeks ago and have to pay my dad back for fixing my car. ugh. and i owe money to school.&nbsp; im gonna be soo poor.&nbsp; i need to find another job. preferably in a salon. 

ive been partying way too much lately. anyone want to party it up with me?"

On Monday he got really pissed at me for lecturing Peter, telling him that we needed to leave since I was bringing him to work and since i was being nice because this weekend he had been mean to me so i didn't have to bring him anyways (wow long run on.) So my dad was full on screaming at me and came at me with a cooking spoon in his hand like he was going to hit me.&nbsp; It was insane and scary. I've never in my life seen my dad this mad before. It really upset me because i didn't do anything wrong.&nbsp; He's the one that's been a jerk to me all weekend long.&nbsp; On Saturday we went to newport so that peter could visit a friends and the whole time my dad was yelling at me about not believing in god and calling me a liar because he dream that I said something mean about Peter before we left.&nbsp; I didn't say anything about Peter except that he was sleeping and that dad should wake him up if we were going to leave soon.&nbsp; It really hurts me when he calls me a liar since I don't lie anymore.&nbsp; I know i used to lie alot about little things when I was in high school but I have outgrown that.&nbsp; I hope he apologizes because I'd like to have a relationship with him and if he keeps treating me shitty then I don't think i can . 

So all weekend I'd been sneezing like crazy because of my allergies.&nbsp; Then last night around 11:30pm i started wheezing and coughing up mucus.. (wicked gross.)&nbsp; It got soo bad that by 4:30am i couldn't really breathe well.&nbsp; So I woke up my mom and she called the doctor and the she told my mom that I should go to the hospital.&nbsp; It was scary since I couldn't breathe. The doctor in the ER told me that I had had an allergy induced asthma attack.&nbsp; So now I have an inhaler and am on some sort of steroid. oh what fun."

I had camp orientation this week and I start camp monday. 
I'll be doing after camp @ sunrise park on mondays+fridays.
I met a really nice guy today.
Too bad he's illegal.

Tomorrow is my 20th birthday. 
It's weird because I still feel like a more mature version of my sixteen yrold self. 
Im doing the same things I did back then minus going to high school. 

Mom, Peter and I are going to Newport, RI for our bday.We leave today and come back tomorrow. It's suposed to be for both of us but I feel like we're just going for Peter. He wants to go to visit his friend Joe on friday. I wish there was something fun i could do for my birthday but my only good friend I'd wanna share it with is six hours away. Hopefully the Lake George things happens and I get to visit Peter in Ireland. That'd be the best."

when i go home the only friend i'll have is peter and im totally okay with that.&nbsp; especially now that he can keep a secret.&nbsp; it's gonna be really sad when he goes off to ireland in august and i'll be left at home to be bitched at every day by my mom.&nbsp; im gonna miss him alot and im gonna be way jealous. lol. that lucky jerk.&nbsp; im really proud of that guy.&nbsp; he makes the deans list every semester and works his ass off even though there are more fun things he could be doing.&nbsp; i wish i could be like that but i just hate writing and school work that isn't going to help me with my future job at all. it is pointless. i need to have a reality check and get my butt in gear. i can't keep slacking off. im just not cut out for school. which has screwed me. now im going to have to pay my parents shit loads of money for the past semesters fuck ups.&nbsp; also i'll probalby have to pay for cosmetology school on my own. at least that is only 5 thousand. 

this summer is gonna be filled w/ working non-stop. so if you want to hang w/me then it'll have to be free because i won't have any money. especially since im paying for my own car insurance and gas now. im gonna be a poor bitch this summer. lol.&nbsp; the only real fun im gonna have is when i go to lake george w/jess,mike,and a friend of my choice. idk who yet. it'll probably just be peter.

im probably gonna go play the sims now.&nbsp;

"event","the party sucked. 
i only knew three people. 
mike, chris[from acting class], and jim bouchard[who pretended he didn't know me].
i stood around for three hours either watching them play guitar hero or watching mike play the drums while jim played guitar in the freezing basement. 

it definately would have been more fun if john or karen were there. 
i need to hangout with those two soon. 

i can't wait till winter break. only four more days<33"

"event","exams next week. 
i am soo happy that school is almost over. 
hiding my septum piercing from my parents isn't hard at all. 
which is nice. 
i can't wait till it heals fully so that i can get a circular barbell. 
georgina, the piercer, thought that a retainer would be more comfortable if i had to hide it. 
buttttt once im at school i wont have to hide. YEI!!

ive got almost all my xmas shopping done. 
i still have to buy peter and siena presents. 
i have no clue what to get peter. 
he is so hard to shop for. 
hmm. peterrrrr- GIVE ME IDEAS!

ive already made two friends at coby. 
cynthia and tom. 
im totally stoked to hang out w/ them in january. 
now all ive got to do is save up $1thousand and i'll be golden."

"event","i love my friends. <br />and people are actually making plans with me.<br />which i really nice. <br />today i hung out with karen and john at the mall. <br />john went by the guy with the electronic swirly thingy. <br />the guy asked him if he liked it and john said that he'd rather poke his eye with a pencil. <br />HAHA. <br />that is one funny guy. <br /><br />im so excited for the 16th. <br />i'm getting my septum pierced AND going to a concert w/ liz!!!!!<br />YEI! i haven't been to a concert since august. <br />dancing is a must. <br /><br />but shhhhh! my parent's don't know about the septum thing. <br />so keep it on the down low. <br /><br />my nana&nbsp; is in the hospital still. <br />might be comming home tomorrow. <br />i made her day today and brought her a piano scarf. <br />she LOVED it. w00t. &lt;3<br /><br /><b>EDIT: i am going to wait to get my septum pierced until i get to SUNY cobleskill. <br />my new bff tom is gonna come with me.&nbsp; to empower me. lol. <br />he's spiffy. &gt;^-^&lt; </b>"

"event","so my nana ended up not having surgery on friday. they knocked her out. and then went through their check list at the hospital. apparently whoever was supposed to get the extra blood forgot. so they couldn't do the surgery. she's having the surgery tomorrow tho. 

also my uncle larry was admitted to the hospital too. his leg is infected. this is a cause of the diabetes he has. larry's twin brother, my uncle steve, died a few years ago because of diabetes and the events leading to his death started w/ his leg becoming infected. my dad doesn't think that larry will die. mostly because the doctors identified the problem earlier than they did w/ steve. 

hopefully both of them will be fine. 

peter went back to school today. im going to miss him but sometimes i wont because he makes me so mad. he told mom that i was thinking about getting my septum pierced and she totally flipped. she said that i couldn't live with her if i did and that she would tell my dad. which would make him angry but i still think he would let me live with him. and they don't even have to know if i get it pierced or not if i get it done w/ a circular barbell. i wish peter would just not open his mouth. he can't keep a secret. which is sad. 

oh a happier note, im getting more and more psyched for going away to college. all ive got to do to guarantee that mom will pay my way is to get a C or better in all my classes. that is gonna be tough when it comes to history but maybe i can get my teacher to let me do some extra credit. she seems nice enough. i really need to get out of here.  i am just reminded too much of the past and i want to forget all about the people who hurt me so much. i can't forget unless i get away from the things that remind me. i saw jillian at the mall on friday morning. it was kind of depressing. but i didn't say anything to her. i wouldn't anyways because her mother was there. one of the few people that i actually hate. i don't think she saw me. which is good. i still don't understand how a perfectly great friendship could just fall to pieces like it did. it's sad.

wow that wasn't much of a happy note. but w/e. 

here is something happy: i am definately getting a new camera for xmas. most likely a canon powershot A530. and i'll be drawing more pictures in math class. karen thinks that i have artistic ability. so im gonna draw a different picture during each class until the end of semester. maybe i'll post them on here. i feel like a little punk highschooler by not paying attention in class but it is soo easy and way boring. yei for math being lame!!"

"event","today was&nbsp; kinda sad. 
my nana is in the hospital. 
she has three blocked arteries and a hole in her heart.
her surgery is tomorrow.
we're all scared that she is going to die. 
i love my nana so much. she is the nicest, most loving person i know. 
i really hope she doesn't die. 

tomorrow i am braving the crowd and going shopping mad early. 
bad idea. i know. but it'll be fun. and the sales could be good. 
energy drinks will be a must since i have to work from 10am-3pm. 
MADNESS!!"

I'm teetering on the thought of quiting dance. I've been doing it for so long that i've begun to get annoyed with all the bullshit. Honestly like you think after a certainn amount of years, youd get recognition... :( Nope. That's all i wanted.
But now that i'm in my 2nd year of college i figure that it's time.. i have too much on my plate this comming year, i  can't afford to waste my time. The whole studio fusterated me and upped my stress farther than you can imagine. I'm tried of crying of fusteration. i'm tired of being sick. And the final decision was the fact that it was costing me so much money.. this year, i'd imagine to spend at  least 1000$ on dance. i'm gonna save for my car instead.

So all that to say, "" Christina, you did the right thing.""  it's not worth it if your not happy.   

All in all, leave me comments and let meknow what you think..:)"

I'm working like a mad woman and i'm hopeing tonight to go to the movies, either with Zac, or with my sister. Either way i'm going to see a movie, which makes me excited that i wont be wasting my time on Msn. 

I've noticed that everyone isgetting Blah. i bet it's because of the constant heat, everyone is fusterated and bored. you dont wanna leave your house cause it's soo cold but you wanna leave cause your bored. it's a real bummer.

I bought thisfunky chair at walmart yesterday, Oh man, it's sexy. Ilovvveee it. its so nice to sit on that it's hard to  ever get up! it's awesome
 so  At anyrate, i'm going to Arizonas on friday night :) with Dee! i hope som, i eally wanna let loose and go wild. i'm excited.

At anyrate. Good day."

Number 1 : I  dont fucking sleep... like i think i'm going to go to a sleep clinic becuase i can't sleep and it's not making my life easyer. i act upon things and i'mnoteven getting any sleep.

Number 2: My room is making me angry i clean it and it doesn't even dfeel like i did any thing.. :@ iit'smaking me mad.

number 3: i work and work and work, and i never go out.. i never see my friends or getto go out..it's sad i really miss everyone somuch and i can't wait to see them. 

But on the bright side,i'm working and making money, and i'm glad that i have the means to buy things and i'm saving alot. I guess not going out to the movies and saving from buying fast food is helping meto save money. I know that when i do buy things i make sure i'm gonna ACTOUALLY need it. :)
More good news, i'm loosing weight! i guess no fast foodandexcersise is helping lots.. and i'm glad.. 
Now the reason why i know i lost the weightis acoually a funny very embarassing story.. And it involves a bathing suit. :| :|

Sothe night got worse. we got in the van after the club and decided to get some food! We goto  the closest subway and guess whowe meet there.. 2 guys that danced with the2 gurls that i was with... EVENTOUALLY WE WERE BACK IN THEFUCKINGVAN DRIVING TO A FUCKING HILL IN DOWNTOWN HAMILTON. If i wasn't cheezed enough for now being lost. the 2 of the girls and the guys decidedto  go for a walk.. leaving me and 2 others in  the van, FOR  OVER AN HOUR. Ok ask me if i wanted to  kill me some people.. They didn'thave their cell phones with them either... 

So they come strolling back up like evertything wasawesome... meanwhile i was sharpening my knive.. lol..
And theyre like OK! we haveto get back to the QEW lol. here we go.. we get lost trying to find it and we then discover that the 403 links into the QEW..but we were going in the torontodiretion..

WE finally turn around and i  see things that are familiar, LIKE THE BURLINGTON SKYWAY.. Fuckers.

I  Get back toSharons place... and it's like 6 am.. AND I GET TO SLEEP  ON THEFLOOR! WHOO HOOOOOO
I tell you... i was on the floor, like no matress.. noblankets.. FLOOR, YAY

I called my dad shortly after to pick me up.. my back and legs were hurting fromdancing for like 5 hours.

Socontinuing on with my bad  day.. i was sitting at the computer reading and  writting and chatting and singing.. lol,and everything else.. when my dad tells me there's Boys here to see me.. Somy face had the dumbest expression on it.. And it was Mario,  Steve and Jon.. 
Iwas surprisedthatthey rememberedthati was home.. they  tookmy outand we laughed at theirstupid jokes and stupidity in general... it was great, like old times...
When they droppedme back at home.. i had togoto work.. andlet me tell you , theusually 10 minute walkturned out tobe like 25 minutes..i was dragging my ass there.. i would have rather ..... anything elsethan go towork..
i had been speratically talking to my mother through out the day.. and she knew howmuch i felt like ass.. i had beencrying toher all day.. she'dtriedher best  to comfort me and i love her for it.. she's so cute

And well as you can guess, everyone atwork was so bitchy.. nice eh?

BUT the best part ofthe night was when mymom surprised me atthe store togive me a hug. i love it.... andshe bought mea necklace.. her reason wasbecause i'm special...isn't that awesome?! I love her...

Soi get homeat 9 and i findout that nothing is gettingbetter here... 
If only people knew....
I can't do anything about it though... itseems minds are already madeup.. 
it's ok though we live to die and that's  comfort enough for me.

Iknow all this drama is sad but comon... who is everyone to tell everyone who to be friends with?
I'm sitting here thinking about whats going on,and alls i cando it smirk.. 
Doesn't anyone understand that this shit is just sad...
Whine whine whine... that's all i hear..

Oh I have and idea! How about everyone wakes up and realises that not everyone will always be friends all the time..
i know i have to be a bitch about it.. but comon someone has to..

With my situation, i know that i dont hate anyone.. i'm just sitting here enjoying my life with my real friends... i'm not gonna pretend who isn't my friend... 
if you choose not to talk to me, that's fine..i  dont care.. i know who my friends are.And last time i checked we as friends communicate. i dont need you to pretend and communicate just becuase i'm present.. lol,i've got plenty fakes in my life i dont need anymore..

SO, if your reading this.. and your affected... how about you talk to me.. if you care that much about me and the situation.. 
But i assume you dont cause you never talk to me anyways..

So how about everyone stops and thinks about our situation here... and let's not blame anyone..
DO you see what exactely the fucking problem IS!?

I'll let youknow what it is... 
It's alittle something called being self-centered.. 
I'm not saying everyone is guily or innocent... i'm just looking at the fact that everyone is always looking out for number one..EVERYONE DOES IT.It is wrong? Should we conform and appoogise? or stand strong to yourself? 
That's the little problem in this situation.... It's the awesome never ending problem, i like to call LIFE.
We create this problems  almost automatically every FUCKING year...
Isn't that funny?
Sit back and think of that..
Isn't it funny, that we've never ALL gotten along? WE'RE always fighting for unity or seperation.. 
For unity? i mean to always get along with everyone... i doubt that will ever completely happen.. World war  one wouldn't have happend then
And for seperation? I mean who exactely are we fighting with? Our stubborn selves? or our urge to fight for our opinions and our thought and OUR OWN judgements?
Ha Ha
Think About it...we've all had our outkast times.. 

This girl right here thinks that this is quite amusing to watch...

Hmm i think i'mdonefor right now... like i said.. this  is pethetic.. LOL....

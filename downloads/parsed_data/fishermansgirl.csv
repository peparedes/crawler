We got married on 8/25/07 

5 hours later - we got pregnant! 

YAHOOO! 

A baby is on the way! 

Due middle of May. 

I am 7 weeks along, no the math doesn't work. but if you know anything about pregnancy you'll know they date from the your period not conception. 

Sounds screwy, when you know you've only be pregnant for 5 weeks, but they say 7."

It's going to be a quiet birthday... that's been awhile. But should be interesting enough...  this be my first sober birthday since sometime around the age of 14 or 15 I'd say."

"event","I've got routines for when he's here, routines for when he's gone, Routines for when he's here and I have to pretend he's not. Pick up the mail, scan for important stuff, get it ready to send off, make note of what needs to be paid and when. Remember that storage unit gets paid 1st of the month. Remember to keep us up on cc payments and such and such. Interesting, how easily it was to click right back into it. Maybe I never clicked out. I like it. It seems to be part of who I am. Anyhow, My God is so great, so strong and so mighty there's nothing my God can not do! I miss my church and my kids.... only one more sunday without them..."

<P>I am home. At headquarters. Where I live. It doesn't feel like home. It feels temporary. Or like time's almost up. Who knows. I am tempted to start the application process for Multnomah in the spring. I don't think I want to wait two years for it. More prayer, but what is this desire I have in my heart. What is it?? Lord, It's bigger than I am. This dream &amp; I can't keep it down. If it's you it will come to pass, maybe next year, maybe in ten, maybe in fifty. Thank you, Lord!</P>
<P>I just had a wonderful nine days, on the road away from here. Away from Bellingham, but not away from what felt like home. Maybe I just consider this base camp for the time being. Who knows. </P>
<P>Just looked at $$$ spent on the trip. It was fun, it was worth every penny. Next time I'll know where we can crunch the dollars, but no use looking back and thinking OUCH that cost us a bunch. I had the time of a lilfetime &amp; so did he. </P>
<P>Off to new starts. New beginnings. Figuring out school and a new job. ASAP. I need a new job. ASAP. Maybe the right one is out there waiting for me. I feel like I need to really really get my life in order. Like I am preparing for something. Something big is coming soon. Not real soon, but soon. And if my God is telling me to get my butt in line for it then so be it... </P>

Like I told Justine I love her and I do. I told her I didn't want to be a problem so I would stop trying to get her to dump her boyfriend and other nonsense. The only thing I can do is give it time. Something is bound to happen, I hope.......
To those in need your in my prayers. Tiger Army rocks ""Roses can't take the pain"" I mean come on that line kicked ass. Well I'm outta here."

I rediscover every day that life is the most beautiful gift you can ever give or recieve. You can do whatever you want with it. So if you've been paying attention to my journal entries you'll remember that I have a crush on this girl named Justine. But the problem is I think we agreed to wait till she got to high school to get together. She also had a boyfriend, and I'm to nice of a kid to try and take a girl from somebody, not like I really could though hahahaha.
So its pretty much me sitting here waiting for her to get to high school. Alex just snapped a goddam wash rag in my goddam face and it real bad. hahahahah. I'm stinky I need a shower. Peace out bitches."

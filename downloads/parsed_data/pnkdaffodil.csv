You are definately one of a kind, but don't let it go to your head... oh yeah, I probably wouldn't want to mess with you or tell you this to your face. </TD></TR>

"event","On May 12, 1907, a Philadelphia school teacher named Anna M. Jarvis held a small ceremony in honor of her mother who had died two years before. Soon afterward, incensed at what she saw as widespread neglect of parents by adult children, she began a campaign to create a national holiday. Her seven-year campaign bore fruit in 1914 when President Woodrow Wilson declared the second Sunday in May a national holiday, to be called Mother's Day.

Anna's joy soon turned to disgust as florists and greeting card merchants began aggressively promoting the new holiday to increase sales. She watched in horror as her initial vision of the holiday was lost in an orgy of crass commercialism. 

""I wanted Mother's Day to be a day of sentiment, not of profit,"" Anna said. Bitter and enraged, she spent the rest of her life in futile efforts to have the act repealed. She lobbied, wrote thousands of letters to public officials, and filed lawsuits to stop Mother's Day celebrations. By 1923, having spent all the money she had, Anna stepped up her campaign with more aggressive methods, culminating in her arrest and imprisonment for disturbing the peace at a Mother's Day convention. Defeated and impoverished, Anna lost her home and spent her final years in a sanitarium, largely supported by charitable contributions from grateful florists. 

Anna Jarvis never married, and never became a mother herself. Shortly before her death in 1948 she confided to a reporter that she was sorry she had ever conceived the idea of Mother's Day.

"event","finally got to talk to him face to face last night. if you can even say it was talking. i knew what was going to be said, it was already hinted at. but laying there actually seeing him say those things was even worse. theres no words right now to describe the horrible feeling i have. 

the wierd ironic thing is that at the same place that we met, we ended. the city, the room. exact. 

when i went to work the other flight attendant asked how things went, i told her, and she siad to me ""you dont seem too heartbroken about it, you must have not been in love with him too much."" 

the problem with that is that i was. 

i am finally realizing the downsides of this job. and i dont know if i like it."

"event","sorry kids havent been keeping up on this thing. so heres the short of it..

been off of work for almost 2 weeks. and that means vacation with travis. so this time we went to new orleans. and yes those girls gone wild vids are correct when they show girls flashing every where you go. and no erin, i was not one of them. suprising huh? we went right before carnivale/mardi gras so it wasnt really crazy, there was still lots of boobs out there. 

then it was to san diego for a little sight seeing where travis lives. i am jealous. warm and sunny all year through. hopefully soon he will come to chicago to enjoy our cold-windy-grey days. 

home for a couple days. 

and in a few hours i am off to las vegas with eve to see social distortion. 


hopefully soon i will give details. maybe."

"event","Maybe our mistakes are what make our fate. Without them, what would shape our lives? Perhaps if we never veered off course, we wouldn't fall in love, or have babies, or be who we are. After all, seasons change. So do cities. People come into your life and people go. But it's comforting to know the ones you love are always in your heart. And if you're very lucky, a plane ride away."

"event","so sitting around yesterday and the phone rings. Unknown caler shows up on the caller ID, i am thinking who the hell could this be. i answer and a lady with a southern voice says, ""hi my name is robin and i am calling from southwest airlines"" i freeze. i know what shes already going to say. in short, i got offered my job at southwest officially. i get to go to dallas august 2nd. while i am excited to go texas, in the summer i imagine will not be very enjoyable. 

but...

while going to dallas for a month with all expenses paid is rad, i wont have the usual people around like i do now. but it is only a month i can always call them. plus there will be alot of people at training, so theres new friends. 

getting through training, not so hard hopefully. but when i do get finished, i get my assignment as to what city i have to go to. chicago is of course at the top of my list. but i may get to move to california, baltimore or florida. which i am very excited about, but that means once again not seeing people often. i dont know if i can deal with that. 
moving away from everything i know, is one tough decision.... and i have 1 week to figure it all out. ahh."

"event","a lot of things have happened since i last updated. i told myself i was going to actually update this thing.. not like anyone reads it but still. so the week of the reverend went very well, the show in champaign was great, there wasnt a lot of people at all so things werent very packed. which is nice. so while in champaign jimbo, came up to marynia, adam and i as we're sitting at a booth drinking our beers. hes a relly nice guy. chit chatted for a bit. after that on to madison, our flight there was ok, no problem, got to our hotel got lunch took a nap, went out to dinner with hannah (who i havent seen in forever) and then went to the show. yet again upfront and a good crowd a little over filled, but nothing too bad. so as marynia thought we were just going to go back to the hotel after the show, we decide to wait around and see of jimbe comes around again. we go to the back, and scott (drummer) comes out and starts talking jim, (the rev.) comes out starts talking and then jimbo, and bobby the roadie. Its was quite a awesoeme time considering the only people there was me marynia and 2 other people. we talk for a long time eventually jimbo brings us on the bus gives us a tour, shows us pics of his family (his son austin is the cutest thing ever!) and go to a bar next door. and as we are talking i mentioned what i do for a living, and scott gives me his phone number with hopes i am going to fly him somewhere for free, we'll see about that. its very odd having a 'sorta famous' persons number in your phone. marynia got bobbys number and that was that. our flight back to chicagio was horrendous, the one we were to get on was full, except for 1 damn seat so marynia goes ahead with hopes that i will meet her in chicago in like 2 hours. not bad right? wrong. that flight was at 1055am..i got into chicago at 330pm. the next flight was delayed due to weather and crap. but i eventually made it home and to marynia. we were told to call bobby when we were in chicago and thats just what we did. that whole weekend was awesome. calling off work to go be a groupie for week. thats fun."

"event","i hate this whole situation between chris and i. i talked to him (finally) a couple nights ago and found out hes going to vegas this week. ya fucking vegas..we all dont know what can happen there. especially when Viva las Vegas is going on.. i was livid at that when i heard that. i told him that i wanted to go on vacation with him months ago, and he always said that he wanted to save his vacation time for later. which was fine with me at the time. but now all of a sudden you take vacation time and go to vegas? ya this wasnt convieniently planned at all was it..  its just the thought of him doing something without even having the decency of ending things officially with me makes me lose all the respect and trust i had for him. i honestly thought he was a better person than that. he obviously isnt and might as well go start dating his ex girlfriend again.
 
everyone is trying to tell me things i should do about this. but its hard trying to just forget about someone that was a considerablly large part of your life, when you dont know whats going on. i mean there could be nothing going on in vegas or this past month, not a big possibility, but still a possibility right? theres just this part of me that hopes that nothing happened...theres a million thoughts in my head about what i should do, what went on when i wasnt around, a reason.. this just puts me back to where i was over a year ago.. and i finally thought that part of my life was over with. i just wish he would fucking realize what hes putting me through. so i could just get on with everything one way or another.


i also saw allison the other night and kinda sorta mention something about seeing a pilot at work to her... but i still have yet to even talk to him. i kinda said it so that she would tell chris, and he would get upset. 

i think she told chris...
and 
i think i regret saying it..."

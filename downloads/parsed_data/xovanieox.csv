I wore cologne to get the feeling right
<B>We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV</B>
And that's about the time that she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

The lights below...they spell out your name.
You're comfort on my mind and you're with me all the time.
And lots of feelings that I can't explain.

I won't spend another night alone.

Out of every guy I meet, no other can compete
I'd ditch 'em all for a night with you.
I know you don't believe you mean this much to me
But I promise you that you do.

I won't spend another night alone.

If I had one wish this is what it would be...
I'd ask you to spend all your time here with me,
And we'd be together forever.
We'd buy a small house in south central L.A.
Raise lots of kids then we'd both join a gang
Just as long as we're together.

The things you make me wanna do
I'd rob a quik-e-mart for you
I'd go to the pound and let all the cats go free
Just as long as you'd be with me.

I won't spend another night alone.

today I made you a mix tape
and I decorated it with lots of stars.
it had all my favorite songs.
there was jawbreaker and armchair martian
built to spill and the descendents.
hell I even put one of ours on it.

falling for you was the easy thing to do.
if only somehow I could make you hang around.

today I made you a mix tape
to say exactly how I feel inside
and make you feel it to.
these are the songs that make me smile
and cry myself to sleep at night
when I'm lying without you.

I love you more than I ever loved anyone before.
hey silly boy I'm begging you.

all of these songs they remind me of you
I hope that you like this song.

did you ever listen to the words and melody
do you feel the pain inside
the way that it hurts me?
when your in your room at night
I hope you'll be singing along.
and make me a tape of your favorite songs.

<B>Complete and total adoration,
My gift to you, my heart was yours,
In ten weeks you shaped it,
In one night you murdered it.
Torn from my chest and laid at your feet,
That first step that you took was the worst.
Since then you've walked a thousand miles in solace and short remark,
And I still have these memories,
But will never see what we could have been.
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go?
Remember, cause that's all you can do.
We'll never make another memory,
We'll never make another memory.
I wish I would have died in your arms the last time we were together,
So I wouldn't have to wake without you today.
This time I thought things were real,
You said they were,
What happened?
You were a priority,
Was I an option?
I let you see a side of me that I don't share with anyone.
Promises are just words unless they are fulfilled.
Knew from the beginning all I had to offer you was my heart,
I'm just sorry that it wasn't enough.
So, we'll go our own ways,
And hopefully you'll remember these things I've told you,
Hopefully you'll understand that everything I said is in sincerity.
A broken heart is not what I wanted from this,
But I guess I've learned from it.
But aren't you supposed to learn from your mistakes?
I don't consider this a mistake,
I just wish the story didn't end this way,
Cause I'm still in love with the person who helped me write it.
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go?
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?</B>

Thinking of the words to say,
I'd like to think that this was fate.
Reference to a song you love, 
Spell confusion with a 'k'.
Like a star without its strings, 
I'm hanging here on these two wings.
For that smile and those eyes...(I'm falling)

If time could stop, how could I make this more poetic?
When there's nothing more pathetic to be said...

You bring me out, show me light, 
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.
You carry through, you make me smile.
If it were you and me tonight,
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you,
For you...

If you ever had the chance,
Would you make your life seem right?
Or would you only hold it back,
The good times, the hard, and the bad.
Whatever you say is alright,
Just as long as there's no doubt.
Could you look me in the eyes...(And say hopes died)

If time could stop, how could I make this more poetic?
When there's nothing more pathetic to be said...

You bring me out, show me light, 
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.
You carry through, you make me smile.
If it were you and me tonight,
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you.

Our wish,
Each time,
Keeps me returning to you,
Night after night...
Lift me up as high as the clouds that warm the sky,
For you and I...

You bring me out, show me light, 
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.
You carry through, you make me smile,
If it were you and me tonight,
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you...

<B>The Sky Could Fall Tonight</B>

You don't care about impossible
Something I wish I could learn from you
Write me down is the best idea you had
Watch the fire fly cause I struck the match tonight

When you help me tight through this moment in time
Pull these words off from my lips
Keep them safe, just remember that we wrote...

There's a hope
There's a light
And I see it in your eyes
And I hope you can see it in mine
(There's a secret held inside)
There's a chance
And a time
That the sky could fall tonight
And I will be here at your side

Watch as the ground turns as dark as the shadows cast on them and I disappear...
How are you perfect when I'm just wasting time
Just to coast inside and I'm waiting for the fall...

When you held me tight with a sense in your eyes
When I'm with you things are right
I'll keep you safe, just remember that we wrote...

There's a hope
There's a light
And I see it in your eyes
And I hope you can see it in mine
(And everything could fall tonight)
There's a chance
And a time
That the sky could fall tonight
And I will be here at your side 

Stars are never out of reach for you just dream (Just dream...)
Hold out your hand and touch the sky
Just dream 
(Just dream...)
Just dream
Tonight

There's a hope
There's a light
And I see it in your eyes
And I hope you can see it in mine
(And everything could fall tonight)
There's a chance
And a time
That the sky could fall tonight
And I will be here at your side
If the sky should fall tonight
I will be here at your side
If you fall tonight I'm here...

<B>Save Me From Me</B>

If you only knew the pain
The pain I keep inside
The pain that makes me ""me""
Then without it who am I
In a room with broken walls
And I'd let you see the dreams
I want you to see

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

And I'm losing my will
Just to hold you in
I'm giving up the hope
That you could have been the one
To save me from me
And now all this will mean
And I'll taste that defeat
I'll give in this once

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

Still I know I'll carry on
Guide me through the life I lost
To find these faults in me...
To find these faults in me

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

To save me from me"

"event","im in such a bummed out mood and i dont even kno y... well i do but i dont... i dunno.

i need to bawl my eyes out... i feel like im gonna have an emotional breakdown... i hold so much pain and anger inside and one day its all gonna come out at once... theres things im still hurt over that are long gone... the honest truth? i miss anthonys world famous hugs that made me feel 100% better, i miss his love and caringness that i just threw out the window and took entirely for granted, and i miss being such a goof with him and having fun, or our quiet moments that were never awkward but peaceful... and i miss how much i liked tibi rite frum the start, how he wus perfect in so many ways, how i couldnt stand to sit beside him and keep myself from hugging or kissing him, just how irresistable he wus to me... and yes, i even miss how with corey i felt so young and like he wus there to take care of me, and did care for me, how much i made him laugh and how he told me i made him feel good 'cuz no ones ever told me that, how much i always wanted to just cuddle with him or hug him because i felt so safe and comfy in his arms, just the adventure of being with him i guess... and i dont even kno if i should bother saying nice things like that bout him, becuz it seems that everytime i write sumthing possibly nice about him it backfires and its like im begging for him back, supposedly... im allowed to say wut im feeling, thats how i feel about the situation. the end. ...things with me and luke are good, and i feel like with him we really have sumthing, but theres that special sumthing that everyone else had that hes missing... hes missing those million dollar hugs, that irresistable-ness, that adventure... but maybe i like it, cuz its simple? he picks me up, we go to justins, we cuddle and hold hands and talk and laugh, and he takes me home... or we go off-roading... i dont even know.

i get so many offers *out* but im afraid to take them... i dont kno where i want to go... i find myself calling jessica more often now, rachel and tasha too... i need sumone to talk to... but the moment i hear their voices on the phone its like i forget bout my troubles but not because i want to... with jessica, i dunno, i want to tell her so bad how much im hurting inside but i cant and that adds to the hurt becuz i luv her so much and i just dont kno y i cant open up to people, even my best friend... and with rachel, i dunno, we have our late night talks and i like her knowing im here for her, but i feel like we cant talk about anything but craig... and the moment i change the subject she has nuthing to say, then its right back to craig... but i luv rachel and i miss hanging out with her, and its fuckin retarded that according to craig we arent allowed to? wtf is that shit?? cuz clearly im such a horrible person and im gonna force her to cheat on him cuz thats wut im like?? FUCK THAT. u dont fuckin kno me AT ALL if thats wut u think, u kno shit all. and then tasha? well, i dunno, it seems like i just cant tell her how i feel becuz we havent been as close for as long... i just need a friend who i can sit there and cry on their shoulder... i need anthony rite now, hes like my best friend cuz hes the only one ive ever been able to open up to, honestly tell how i wus feeling, and cry in front of.... and he wus rite there to hug me and make me feel better. im such an idiot y did i throw that away... we barely even talk now and he has no idea how much i need him... i luv him only as a best friend could, and he has no idea.

everyone thinks im so cold-hearted and im not... i just feel so sheltered like i cant show or explain how im feeling i just dont kno how to and its SO frustrating... and no matter how hard i try to explain, or let one teardrop fall, i cant, i wont let myself... and its so hard. im tired of being so hurt inside and pretending im not... actually i dont even pretend im not... becuz i am a really happy person... but when im sitting at home alone, and no ones answering their phones, all im left to do is sit and think... about how much i hurt inside... and no one even knows... everytime i exhale its like im trying to force a little bit of that pain out but its never enough... and i try so hard to push it out.... and its just not working...

i just need to talk toanthony right now i need him so bad... i dont want to get back together with him thats not y i need to talk to him... i just need him as a friend and it sux becuz ive let him slip away and now hes not here when i need him...

i just need a good friend...

the conclusion to each day.
you are in all that i do,
and everything i say.

you're the smile on my face,
the twinkle in my eye.
the warmth inside my heart,
the fullness in my life.

you're the hand that's laced in mine,
and the coat upon my back.
my friend, my love,
my shoulder to lean on.

you're my silly, mature, caring,
thoughtful, bright, and honest guy.
the one who holds me tightly,
when i need to cry.

you're the dimple in my cheek,
the ever-constant tingle in my soul.
the voice that makes me weak,
the happiness of my life.

you are all i've wanted,
you are all i need.
you are all i've dreamed of,

a swelling of the heart
i never truly thought i would be

you take me by the hand
and lead me by the heart
over a beach of sand
through the grasses that we part

with you i let go
of intuition and sound mind
my feelings i cannot help but show
to a person who is so kind

you kiss my lips so tender
embrace me through the night
to you i have surrendered
myself so hold on tight

so strongly you hold my hand
whisper softly in my ear
i really feel that you understand
everything you hear

i lose myself in you
this close i have never been
these feelings are so new
to have a lover who is my best friend.

I'm getting into you 
Because I've got to be
You're essential to survive
I'm going to love you with my life

Do you know what you are getting yourself into

I've been a liar and I'll never amount to

Help me believe in anything

When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

And then begin to breathe in
The darkest country road
And the strong scent of evergreen
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home.

""do they collide?"" 
I ask and you smile.
With my feet on the dash
The world doesn't matter.

When you need directions then i'll be the guide
For all time.

anywho... my whole right side HURTS... baseball is bad... lol no its fine, im just used to being a lazy ass these days so any sort of physical activity kills me... bah i need the exercise.

so yeah curtis asked me to go to prom with him... josh thomas seems angered by this becuz he did technically ask/tell me to take him first... jeff appears to still be mad over it, he hasnt talked to me yet... my mom seemed to be all about me going with curtis cuz he asked first... lol... meh im excited i wanted to go to prom... my schools proms r pretty shitty, but the people are so much fun i luv them all <3 so yeah i gotta buy my ticket ASAP tho... cuz the prom is on the 13th... sooo mom? $75? please and thank you.

i hope i can go out tomorrow nite or at least have sumone over... i dont mind not going out, but company sure would be nice... i wont bug the parentals until tomorrow.

im kinda curious as to the situation between me and luke... i think i kno wut will inevitably happen, but i kno i dont think i want it rite now... im thinkin come tweed time, or shortly after, id be ready... and my only reason behind that is, well, theres prom... and i dont wanna go to prom, with curtis, and have a bf... itd be kinda awkward... and me and curtis are always really flirty and stuff i guess, so id be all oh hell no not again... so yeah, im holding off the inevitable till im ready.

I'm sittin' here all by myself
just tryin' to think of something to do
Tryin' to think of something, anything
just to keep me from thinking of you
But you know it's not working out
'cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
to leave the rest of the world behind

Well I didn't mean for this to go as far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close and share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back/but I know you did

I'm sittin' here tryin' to convince myself
that you're not the one for me
But the more I think, the less I believe it
and the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
will just kill me if I'm on my own
I know it's not the smartest thing to do
we just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight

I'm sittin' here tryin' to entertain myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration goneit's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything I see reminds me of you
Oh please, baby won't you take my hand
we've got nothing left to prove

And I didn't mean to meet you then
we were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
the way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love, but I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
No, you didn't mean to love me back
But you did

people gain so many brownie points with u, and then stuff like this happens... and they lose a few. thats how i look at it... i just hate being let down or having plans canceled - especially when im missing school for it.

when i wus told about milt, i honestly felt so sad... and i wanted to be there for everyone... but nope, i cant go.

and i feel bad in a way, if im mad... but like, im missing school just so i can end up sitting at home?

and maybe im so bitter becuz im not able to go out all week... school = get home around 330 and then leave at 430 to go to drivers-ed, where i dont get home till 10... like my life sux big time this week. i hate it.

im glad curtis came over last nite... it gave me sum entertainment for like an hour or so... thank god.

so i guess im outtie... i hope this doesnt happen tomorrow nite... if a dirty jeep doesnt come get me after drivers-ed tomorrow nite, oh hell no... thatd be so shitty. i think id snap.

without them we equal nothing
And all I can see is the place I wanna be
Suddenly my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down
But keep away from me... keep away from me

-//-

This puzzled look you stare to me says
""You put me back together""
Her head's down, she waits impatiently
Scattered in my heart, torn up and ripped apart
It's ripped apart..

Wind strong in my face, I'm still staggering through
I'm closer to the ground than I will ever get to you
Dirt deep beneath my fingernails, I'm gripping to the floor
I'm searching through the world, always looking for something more

And these cold winter nights, without you next to me
It feels like twenty below
Frostbite on my heart
This pain and suffering are feelings that you don't know

-//-

It seems like just yesterday.
when we would stay up late out on your front lawn
talking about where we've been and all
the places we're going.
we would lose track of time watching
cars pass us by and I would sneak back
home before the sunrise
.....and how everyday would seem so long
and every night would go
on and on and on

so long sincerity, escape from reality.

-//-

Your Insecurities are on your heels again
never let them get the best of you never let
those demons in your head. just stay away.
cut off all communications, do whatever
do whatever it takes, just walk away

you cant say that I'm the one whose changed
cause I've been this way forever
and forever I will stay the same.
you cant say that I'm the one whose changed
cause your the one whose changed.

I want to break my legs just so I won't forget to be nice to you.
I am not me.
Think about jumping backwards into a pool of salt and knives, now that's real pain
Not like your heartbreaks and tears.
I can't believe that was me.
I am not me.
I used to say, ""I can't let me be who I am"" I am not me.
I am alone with you.
I'll stay alone with you.
Let's try this theory of nothing means nothing.
If nothing meant nothing, then why did it hurt you so much?
I want to break my legs just so I won't forget to be nice to you.
There's so much left to say, the hardest thing to say is that I'm sorry

east side west side where do I stand when you walk in.
did you forget me, I wasn't gone that long,
you may think I was, you weren't thinking at all.
I won't let you just stand and walk away.
I'm sorry that I'm not sorry,
because it's the love of my life and the life that I love.

"event","yesterday... uhmmmm ended up goin to chill at kellee's with tibi... its kinda sweet, how bad shit happens and u can still come outta it with friends, and new ones!! even if kellee and tibi dont hook up, i kno they'll be good friends... it wus a good time... it wus awkward being in that house again and chillin in kellees room instead of his :S ... i almost saw them as we were goin to the door, i ran away so fast, and just stood by tibi's car... and then we got in till they left... i cant face them... especially for the fact they all think im sum huge whore, i cant deal with people who's perception of me is so wrong and horrible, and for no reason... i missed his mom, shes too funny!! and as we were leavin her dad wus yellin, *sigh*, funny old times lol... kellee wus so wired it wus hilarius, ive never seen her like that!! its becuz of her chocolate bunny, that tibi refused to eat becuz its fattening! lmao... 

after tibi and i evacuated there, we went to rachels... originally i wus goin to rachels and mike little wus comin to get us, but i dunno he wus in whitby and aleisha had passed out... and tibi wus headed to this guy rileys party, where rachel and i were supposed to go... so we ended up just goin with tibi to meet up with pedro, alex, and bub... and then we all went to the party... as soon as i walk in the door, i saw owen!! i havent saw him in forever, it wus nice... and then i saw joey! and barnes! and megan wus there! uhm oh and then i wus standin there talkin to owen, and BAM mason comes around the corner!! that wus sweet we had a little talk... i asked him bout when he talked to ""him"" and he wus like yeah whatever i told him shit and bout how u resisted big time(which is true x3), but it doesnt even matter now and i wus all ur rite, cuz clearly it doesnt make a difference anymore... and then, he hugged me and he said in my ear: my girlfriends here. whoa. buddy hopped all over me that nite in quebec, and he has a girlfriend!!! whoooaaaa. and she wus in quebec too. double whoa. but anywho, we left the party becuz supposedly a neighbour had called the cops...

then rachel and i were just sittin in tibis car while him and the boys burned outside... and then we saw guys frum my school!! got all hyped and talked to steve for a sec... then as we were drivin away, i saw like EVERYONE (inman, rich, steve, josh, everyyyoonneee) and i wus talkin to them out my window, but tibi just drove away... how veird... anywho.

so then we went to this school parking lot so the boys could burn sum more... and then pedro comes to tibi's car, and informs us that kevin is coming and he has sandro, gak, eric, and sum sean guy (who rachel and i named BUFU becuz he def. looks like the chinese guy off of how high - trippy.) so then tibi got outta his car to go burn and eric, gak, and sandro got in the car to chill and talk with us... and then smitty came!!! and then mullen and ashley... i havent saw everyone all together in one spot in SO long, it wus wicked!!! then smitty wus leavin and tibi wus still burning, so rachel and i decided we'd leave with smitty...

so smitty wus drivin, eric stole shotgun, and then it wus me rachel and sandro in the back... prob. the funniest car ride of my life! i feel so protected when im with those 3, i forgot wut it wus like... erics a tank, so is sandro, and smittys just insane... but it wus fun. we drove around till we finally found this random girls surprise party, it wus lame, so we evacuated ASAP. the boys were all dancin like 'tards to techno and shit in the car, it wus hilarius... however *blah* i wus feeling, it wus gone cuz they made me forget... and rachel seemed to be havin a good time, as much as she could, and it made me happy to see her laughing and stuff!! 

then rachel and i came to my house... at like 1-130! hahaha... uhm and rachel and tibi chatted online for like an hour, had a huge heart-to-heart... i dunno if it made her feel any better, but he sure had sum good points and suggestions. i havent been out driving and goin to different parties like that for sooo long, i missed it... those kids r all so crazy, it wus refreshing, like a huge breath of fun fresh air. 

so today... my mom is making a ham dinner... how, spectacular.

tomorrow night, tibi kellee pedro and i are chillin... i believe we are goin to watch the sunset out in the boonies and they're gonna burn... it'll be a nice, peaceful, happy time!

i think im gonna hang out with rachel during the day tomorrow... hopefully!! maybe she'll come with us tomorrow nite too!! that'd be nifty.

I'll never hear you say that you love her

My Nose runs the shade of red
I'll never smell your sweet cologne
""Happy Days"" have all gone by
These happy days aren't yours and mine

What do you do
When all you can do is wake up and die?
And what do I do
When every single song I hear reminds me of you?

Why do I keep doing this to myself
I'm asking these questions
I'll keep staring and screaming up into the sky
Until I find you

My Mouth bleeds the shade of red
I won't ever taste your lips
Those ""cotton candy"" kisses of death

Last but not Least
I won't ever touch your skin
Just one last touch but you've been contaminated
So never again

So I'll hit the pavement
it's gotta be better than waiting
and pushing you far away
cause I'm scared.
So I'll take my chances
and head on my way up there.
'Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten.
(8)

(8)
Dig a ditch deep enough 
To keep you clear of the sun 
You've been burned more than once 
You don't think much of trust
(8)

(8)
I heard about your trip.
I heard about your souvenirs.
I heard about the cool breeze, in the cool nights,
and the cool guys that you spent them with.
Well I guess I should have heard of them from you.
I guess I should have heard of them from you.

Don't you see, don't you see,
that the charade is over?
And all the ""Best Deceptions"" and ""Clever Cover Story"" awards go to you.
So kiss me hard
'cause this will be the last time that I let you.
You will be back someday
and this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service
to keeping you away.

I heard about your regrets.
I heard that you were feeling sorry.
I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us.
Well I guess I should have heard of them from you.
I guess I should have heard of them from you.

I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers,
I'll be all right when my hands get warm.
Ignoring the phone, I'd rather say nothing.
I'd rather you'd never heard my voice.
You're calling too late
too late to be gracious
and you do not warrant long good-byes.
You're calling too late.
(8)

(8)
This damp air
is fighting my defroster.
My sighs they ring victorious
& fog this tinted glass.
It's clouded
& so is my head.
The hint of these new tears are sharp.
I try to choke them back.
It's useless.
I am useless against them.
They are beating me with ease.
(8)

(8)
So quiet
another wasted night,
the television steals the conversation
exhale,
another wasted breath,
again it goes unnoticed.

I'll wait until tomorrow
maybe you'll feel better then
maybe we'll be better then
so what's another day
when I can't bear these nights of thoughts
of going on without you
this mood of yours is temporary
it seems worth the wait
to see your smile again
out of the corner of my eye
won't be the only way you're looking at me then 
(8)

(8)
Road rules apply
there's so much action,
you're getting busy.
I'll call your cellular phone
to tell you TV night was
lonely without you
& so am I...
so am I.

She had a history of killing herself 
I had a habit of dying 
I think she gave me something to live for 
I guess I helped her pass her time 

And I had a vision of seeing things straight 
She had the heart of a liar 
I never saw her leaving me once 
She never felt me beside her
(8)

(8)
So this is odd,
the painful realization that has all gone wrong.
And nobody cares at all,
and nobody cares at all.

This is incredible.
Starving, insatiable,
yes, this is love for the first time.
Well you'd like to think that you were invincible.
Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time?
Well this is the last time.
(8)

(8)
This basement's a coffin
I'm buried alive.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
'Cause you're gone
I get nothing
and you're off with barely a sigh.
I never said ""Good-bye""
(8)

(8)
Which of the bold-faced lies will we use?
""I hope that you're happy""
""You really deserve it""
""This will be best for us both in the end.""

But your taste still lingers on my lips
Like I just placed them upon yours
And I starve...
I starve for you!
(8)

(8)
Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And covered with a perfect shell
Such a charming, beautiful exterior
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
Perfect posture, but you're barely scraping by
But you're barely scraping by
(8)

(8)
So much for all the promises you made, they served you well 
and now you're gone and they're wasted on me. 
So much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well
and now it's gone and you're wasted on me.

Do what you must if that's what you wish, 
I can't be a pardon to this
you have a sense that you were born with
You'll find a way to make things right.
(8)

(8)
she said ""i've gotta be honest,
you're wasteing your time if you're fishing round here.""
and i said ""you must be mistaken,
cause i'm not fooling...this feeling is real""
she said...she said ""you gotta be crazy,
What do you take me for? Some kind of easy mark?
""No, you've got wits, you've got looks, 
you've got passion, but I swear that you've got me all wrong.""

and i said ""i've gotta be honest
i've been waiting for you all my life.""
for so long i thought i was asylum bound,
but just seeing you makes me think twice.
and being with you here makes me sane,
i fear i'll go crazy if you leave my side.
you've got wits...you've got looks,
you've got passion but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight?
(8)

(8)
sharp disaster in a fresh new coma
was it worth it when it was over
proving yourself right
you'd make the biggest noise
well.. i'd lock my hands behind my head
i'd cover my heart and hit the deck
i'd brace myself for the impact if i were you
(8)

(8)
I heard that you were living well, but you don't look like your living to me
though the sparkle is gone, the smile is in place so that everyone watching can see
You've got them all convinced, but I know it so well
that you can list your friends, but you can't count on them

Hold it now
you've got everyone convinced that your alright
when no one else is quite as vulnerable
(8)

(8)
I was away for a while 
But I'm hoping someday you'll forgive me 
Though I don't deserve it 
I'll cherish it well if you give me one of your new starts

Just one more last chance 
I swear that I'll earn it 
If you front me for now 
I'm good for it I swear 
I'm better now I swear 

In earlier days, they'd persecute people 
They'd carry them off, and hobble their legs 
For lesser offenses, and how I have harmed you 
And still you allow me to walk free of pain 

Though I punish myself 
I will never settle 
The debts I've incured for scorning the face 
Of absolute beauty, and measureless grace 
And though I once mocked you 
I'm dying to pay for it now 
I'm dying to pay for it now 
(8)

(8)
I'll be living off your phone calls
in your letters and your postcards
Every single word is like a secret wish come true
Who cares if were apart for the big days
It's the small ones that made me fall in love with you
(8)

(8)
So turn
Up the corners of your lips
Part them and feel my finger tips
Trace the moment, fall forever
Defense is paper thin
Just one touch and I'd be in
Too deep now to ever swim against the current
So let me slip away 
So let me slip against the current 
So let me slip away 
(8)

(8)
I wasn't well for a while 
I savored the things that I knew were sure to destroy me 
And that seemed to hold me 
That seemed to carry me where I couldn't go
On the strength of my own 
Well, I should've known
That gets me nowhere 
I've learned that now I swear 
(8)

pressed the seven sequenced silver panic buttons,
the distress calls that fall on a distracted short-wave signal.
a metronome timed to my panic stricken breathing
and a pulse conducted by our dying lines.
you said my heart sounded like a payphone in the rain.
distorted, distant, scrambled and desperate.
baby, i swear to god tonight i am sober.
it's the reception between us that's failing.
everything's coming out all frenzied and confused.
she's got what it takes to make collapsing a habit
and a dance out of a tantrum fit (it's tragic but i am sobering up).
pick up the phone.
tonight i feel like the hero of a rusting war.
my touch has the timing and precision of a car wreck.
no use translating the trembles.
they're symptoms of repetitive testing for fluctuation.
if i come back home, i am bringing back the bends.
so give me a kiss. let me taste the reptilian appeal.
say it again baby. does it turn you on? does it get you hot?
i get a little hysterical sometimes.
the panic you shouldn't have been so sentimental.
all that kicking and screaming.
everything i touch starts peeling.
we malfunction like machines.
get up off the floor and answer the phone.
i want to be a big star.
didn't want to touch so hard.
open the door.
i am your deviant satellite, an orbit defected by the ballast of words.
you're the reason for collisions.
i am face down like a sailor washed up under your window.
tonight is a shipwreck.
navigating through disorder.
now every electric star hums like a telecaster.
how punk rock is that?
you're so oblivious.

Your piss is going sour... my mouth is full for the last time.
Don't think I don't read the gossip, don't think I

You're broken, and I'm laughing, you're broken-go
drink your life away. Go fuck your life away with your

Just go jerk off on your fucking stomach, impregnate
yourself. You're born again, just like you've always
been. Every fucking year... this year you abort
yourself-get the fuck out of my life.
Never come back, I don't ever need you around. What we
shared means shit to you. Laugh at me all you want,
but I'm living what you once wanted. And I'm happy...
happy to be alive with real friend who don't spit in my face.
Real friends don't end friendship with change. It's
really hard to realize that you've stooped so low.
I've given chances, I've tried to mend... but it's all

Tonight I will sleep well. Tonight I realize that I

Those fists won't reach where she lays tonight. Your
little star in the sky just fell. For every minute she
spent in your heaven, was just a minute more in her hell.
Away from this world is her place in this world. Where
the sun's rising doesn't bring with it pain.
You have lost her now... she has forgotten you now.
Her nightmares and secrets washed away. The past won't
escape with your tears forever encased in hollowed out
soul. And that day when the smoke finally clears... your
dark, empty life will be the only one you know. This
picture of her, dead in your arms, will hang from the
nail that she drove through your heart. Your little
star in the sky just fell.


<B>Mordecai</B>

[Day one] Asleep mid-sentence- the words fell apart. No one is listening 
anyway. This day will soon turn black and my ""wants and needs"" will spill 
on my burning ashes. I learned to be selfish today...I learned to be 
alive. These things I care for are for my personal gain and my person 
happiness only. Why should I sit in your chairs and satisfy your 
standards. I've done it all before and I've confused myself a thousand 
times. The tragic day that I call morality just doesn't do it for me 
anymore. No more choices, just standing in the cold. The day will turn 
black and I will have either lived or died. Asleep mid-sentence- my words 
fall to the ground. Swept into this dreamland. Economic satisfaction, 
never succeed. But happiness has its place. Justice will not lie in your 
corner. New day towards death, only compassion for my own needs make my 
need necessary.
[Day two] Throw myself in the corner; I have nothing to complain about
here. A tragic day seems too peaceful to most, spoiled ambitious turned 
my heart to black. I'm figuring out this realization process- the process 
to never look upon bitter ground. Living dreams, loving dreams, awakening 
to what I've always dreamt of. The familiar sound of lovely love from the 
love of my life will keep the notes coming. From the reciting of the 
show, from the plip and the shevanel, from the grind that annoys, and the
sarcasm, they all hate...forever I worship. I'll kill, love, and hate for all of you. 
Thank you for the best part of my life."

in the bright morning my courage falls weak no excuse for my actions, no where to run consequence comes like raining fire, burning every part of me... showing no mercy the day that i thought would never come, has arrived here i lay, a victim of my own decisions i've exchanged the wisdom of God for selfish pride...thus my down fall my appreciation is laced within apologies, for not becoming Your plan grace is where i lay my head for this is where the angels sit... and she spreads her silver wings to offer shade for my pale skin from the blinding sun of consequence consequence...no where to run, but to Your arms in all my shame...reconciled as i weather the storm, i fall to the ground i look to the sky, then His hand reaches for me....alas a new day my appreciation is laced within apologies i'll never understand this grace bestowed upon me... alas a new day"

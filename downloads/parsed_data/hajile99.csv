"event","I won Billy Joel tickets!!!!!!!!!!!! Hoorrayyyyy!!!!! I'm not sure where the seats are, but I'm sure they're better than what David and I had last time we want, and probably better than the ones my sister, brother-in-law and I got the first time I went. That, and I'm entered into a drawing to win the grand prize, which includes limo service to and from the concert, dinner at one of the restaurants in MGM and several other things. The DJ listed them to me, but I was too excited to pay much attention. I'll listen tomorrow to find out what it is. Haha.

Station Casinos made the ""15 Companies That Might Not Survive 2009"". While I have a feeling it's only listed because they are soon to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure their debt, it doesn't exactly make you feel all warm and gooey inside to read that. Not that it's something I want to think about, but my sister has already offered to help me with my mortgage if I do lose my job. We would obviously still have David's income and I would do whatever I had to do to find another job, even if it paid nothing, just to have something, but at least I know I'll have help if the worst should happen. I would hate to lose the house I just bought because of something like that. It would just mean David and I would have to scale back a lot of our purchases and do what we can to stay afloat until I could get another job. But hopefully that won't happen.

And finally, my housing complex has made the news. I noticed the local NBC station outside the gates on my way home this afternoon, but I couldn't tell if it was filming my complex or something near it. They just did a preview segment for the 6PM news and there was my building! They mentioned something about renters being evicted. The complex is half privately owned, half rented out by a management firm (with many of the privately owned being tenant-occupied). I doubt it affects me at all (I'm sure I would've heard something by now) since I own the place, but I'm not sure who it's affected, whether it be the renters, or the tenant-occupied units. Either way, it's probably not a good thing for my value, which I'm sure has already tanked since I bought the place. I know it'll go back up, eventually, but it's one more thing we don't need right now. Oy!"

"event","So more good news...and then some more.

My parents moved up here on Thursday. They wanted help moving in, which I was going to do anyways, but they apparently wanted more help, which they decided to tell me on Wednesday night. They wanted me to see if I could find anyone. Oy! So I told them that David was off and willing to help if they wanted him.

So, they have finally met David. I can't quite get a feeling for how they feel, but it seems to be okay. My dad even asked if he could come over with me on Friday to help move something. He couldn't cause he was at work, but at least they thought about him. Not much else on that front, but it's a step in the right direction.

And the other good news...despite the fact that I said ""I have a new home"" wayyyyy back on May 31st, it should finally be official sometime this week. The documents are supposed to go to the Title Company sometime early this week and I'll hopefully be signing soon after that. And then David and I get to move in. Yayyyy! Or not, depending on how you look at it. Really not looking forward to the move-in, but will be very happy once I'm in and settled.

Oy it's going to be a long month."

"event","Every time I come back home to Chandler, I get very reminiscent, very nostalgic, very pensive. Much more pensive than I normally get when I'm in Vegas and thinking about home. I always start to wonder how my life might be different if I had stayed in town. I rarely think twice about a decision I make; I couldn't go back and change it anyway, so why dwell on it? But this is something I've always wondered. I'll still never know, but it never stops nagging at me. What would my life be like? What would my family be like?

Five years ago, I would've given everything I owned just to have my family back together. It was something my mom swore to me would never happen; she refused. To this day, I've never understood what started the rift between my mom and sister. It's not the first time we'd been torn apart. But this time, it seemed like it was it. I guess part of me wanted to move to Vegas to forget about all the problems. If I wasn't constantly around the divide, it wouldn't seem so real. Now here we are...it took my sister losing her baby for our family to come back together. It's sick, but to this day, I still thank that baby for doing what I couldn't.

I wonder if my mom would be healthier. That's why I came down so suddenly this time. My mom was in the hospital, going in for surgery. I flew down the next day and surprised her, since she didn't know I was coming, to find her howling in pain from her bedroom. All seemed well yesterday, until this morning when she had more pain. It took my dad and I three hours to convince her that we needed to take her to the hospital. She's still there; hopefully she'll be out tomorrow. I wonder though, if anything would be different if I had stayed. I suppose there really isn't any correlation, other than maybe stress levels, but I don't know if I would've changed that at all. I do wonder if I've spent enough time with her. If I hadn't moved, I would have had 5 more years to spend with her, my dad and everyone else. I was up at 4am this morning, listening to my mom howl from the pain and thought to myself over and over again that I don't think she'll be here by the end of the year. It scares me. I know it's going to come some day, but I'm just not ready. I supposed I never will be; who would? I wonder what my dad will do when that times come. I know he's strong, but I just can't imagine how he'll deal with it. I pray it's not something any of us will have to deal with soon, but it's definitely crossed my mind, especially considering her failing health.

I wonder what my life would be like. Would I be with David? I'd like to think so. I can't imagine life without him now. I know we seem like a complete mismatched pair, even we think so, but we love each other, and that's what matters.

And that brings me to my other...perplexities. My sister and I were talking a few months back about how her and mom were discussing me being gay. Long story short, we decided it was about time I talked to them about it, since it's been the elephant in the room for the last five years. But we both decided that I would talk to them about it, but that it had to be in person because anything else is just too impersonal. That was March. This is the first time I've seen them since then, but I don't really think this is the opportune time to bring it up. The last thing I want to do is make my mom more sick, worried, angry, upset or whatever. But if not now, when? I could just bring it up with my dad, but I don't think that'll help clear the air with her. And then, if I do bring it up, do I mention David? I told myself I would, especially once I bought a place, because then I have nothing to worry about. I wouldn't be tied to them financially whatsoever. And even though that's still up in the air, I've wanted to tell them. I told David I wanted us all to have Thanksgiving together this year; I doubt that'll happen, but it's a nice thought.

So now I have no idea what I'll end up doing. If my mom doesn't get discharged before I leave on Tuesday, I'm almost sure I won't bring it up. I at least want her to be at home for it. I don't think it'll be as bad as I imagine it, but I usually like to prepare for the worst. I still don't know why I'm so apprehensive about it; I suppose I just don't like cutting ties, and I'm always afraid that's what will happen.

*sigh*

So many things running through my head. So little time to figure it out.

I suppose I shall see what ends up happening...."

"event","So we have some little updates in the house-hunting. David and I found a single-family home that we absolutely loved. We went into it and both immediately loved it. So we rushed over to the realtor's office and got an offer pushed through on Monday. It's a foreclosure and the bank said to give 5 to 7 days to hear back, so hopefully we'll hear by Friday, if not, it won't be until Monday, at least.

I also just heard back from my realtor about another offer we had out on a condo that both of us liked, though not nearly as much as the home. They've counteroffered my offer, but I haven't quite heard yet what that offer is, so we'll have to see. Before I do anything on this place, I want to find out back from the house, because I  think we agree that we definitely like it better than the condo.

We shall see what happens. Either way, it's finally starting to feel like something is happening with finding a place. Hopefully we'll get this going now!"

Tonight on NBC Nightly News, McCain was interviewed for a few minutes regarding the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. I don't remember word for word, but essentially his statement, with my interjections in parenthesis, was, ""People should not be judged by the color of their skin (only by their sexuality...). All people are equal (unless you're gay...).""

"event","Oyyyyyyy I am SO tired and sore right now. I decided to go on a hike this morning to Juniper Peak out in Red Rock. It's about 4000 foot elevation gain in about 3 miles, so it's pretty steep most of the way. The beginning is just a trail that leads to a wash that you follow into a canyon. The wash is full of boulders that require scrambling over, through, under, etc...as well as pointy trees and cacti that like to poke you ferociously. After finally clearing about a mile of nothing but boulders, you scale several rather steep limestone slabs before reaching another bouldering section just below the peak. The hike started out with 8 people, but 1 decided to stay behind at the limestone cause he didn't feel comfortable with it; the rest of us went on. We get to the base of the last bouldering section just before the summit and it starts to drizzle a little bit. Nothing too worrisome...it was barely doing anything. So we start up these boulders; 4 of them got a bit ahead and three of us were bringing up the tail end quite a bit behind. The four got to the summit before the three of us did; in fact, we were about 30 feet or so from the summit, when all of a sudden it starts pouring rain down. Then the rain turns into snow. We put on some gloves, long sleeves, etc. to make ourselves a bit more comfortable and start to ascend the rest of the way to the summit. Well, the others are coming down, telling us not to go up there; it's apparently howling wind, freezing rain, etc. So, we made it to about 15 feet from the summit. Close enough :P

So we start descending...and it's still pouring rain...and still snowing...and now, with the wind picking up, it starts getting colder, so there's literally ice flying through the air (not huge pieces, but frozen raindrops) that are pelting your face relentlessly. We hiked back down the limestone slabs and into the boulders for about another hour and a half before the storm finally started to let up. We still had some wind, but no rain...and definitely no flying ice. Oy!

And now, my arms are just killing me. I can't even lift them above my head without being in pain. Hell, propping my arms up to type is killer. Other than that, I'm not too bad...a scratch on my elbow and a scrape on my right shoulder...and a little swollen, but other than that..it was... fun, if not a bit harrowing. :P

And now I'm exhausted. Bed soon...and it's only 7:30..."

"event","So I officially have a new job. I had an interview of at Red Rock, a sister property of where I work now. The lady was really nice and told me in the interview that she already had a ""plan"" for me. Even though she didn't offer me the position right then, it was pretty obvious that if she was planning where she wants me so thoroughly (it was pretty detailed), that I was going to get an offer. And I did. She called a few hours later and offered the position.

I put in my two-weeks at the front desk. My official last day at Fiesta will be February 4th. I'm not sure what my schedule will be like over at Red Rock, but she did say that depending on what I was doing each day, I'd be coming in between 5a and 7a. Oy! Oh well. I'll get used to it eventually.

The bad news is that it is a bit of a pay cut moving over, but it'll get me into the accounting field and hopefully I'll be able to move up pretty easily. There's three audits to learn in the department and the more I know, the more I get paid. I can basically set up my own course as to when I want to learn the additional audits. Once I know and feel comfortable with one, I can choose to learn the second and then the third so I'll be making more money. I'm not quite sure how long that'll take, but that's going to be my goal for the time being.

Anyways, so that the plan for now. 13 days till Red Rock, 8 days of work at the front desk."

My dad called me on Thursday night to tell me that he just found out my Uncle was in the hospital. He apparently had a stroke. I get the job of calling my sister up and telling her so she can tell all of our other relatives.

On Friday, I call my mom and find that she was in the hospital the night before because she wasn't feeling well at all. Apparently her blood pressure was something around 250/150 (or something equally as high), but they did an EKG and everything was fine. They got her blood pressure lowered. She made an appointment with a cardiologist for Thursday to see if anything is wrong with her heart.

On Saturday, we finally hear again from my Uncle. He apparently had a stroke an has a brain tumor. We still don't know if it's operable or not. He'll probably be in the hospital at least another week. We're thinking the outcome doesn't look so good, especially with the brain tumor, but we'll see. He's apparently talking okay and everything, so he's doing decently, but who knows how bad the tumor is. Oyyy...

He/she will have the final say in which candidate gets the internship, so I'm one step closer. I'm not quite sure how many people were up for it or how many are still in the running, but my chances are at least remotely higher at this point.

I was in the gym when they called. UNLV opened up a new recreational center with a great cardio room in it. I'm still trying to figure out whether or not it has a weight room, because if it does I surely haven't found it yet. But regardless, I've been wanting to lose some weight so I figure I might as well go to UNLV's since I've paid for it for the last 3 years anyways. I'm trying to do an hour on the treadmill each time I go, though I've only managed that two of the four times I've gone so far, but I've seem notable improvement between those two times.

"event","WooooooT! I have an interview on Monday for an internship at a local accounting firm! They wanted to make it for Friday, but I have to work, so they pushed it back to Monday. I go in the middle of my break for classes (12:45p-5:30p) at 2:30p. Good thing I went to Kohl's and bought some nice shirts and some ties already. Now I'm deciding whether I'll wear one to school or if I should stop back at the condo in between and change. I'll probably do the latter so I won't be as hot and my clothes will stay nice and clean. We'll see though...

Wish me luck!"

Photos from this trip are in the folder titled ""DC NYC Israel 070207 to 071807"". DC, NYC and Israel are split up into separate folders from there.

"event","Yayyyy 15 days!!!!! I'm excited!!! I think right now the most exciting part to me is going to DC for July 4th. I'm sure the Israel excitement will hit me once July 4th passes...or once I leave for DC, but regardless I'm wayyyyyyy excited.

For DC, on Tuesday the 3rd, I believe I will go to a different Smithsonian Museum than I went to last time. I was also considering looking into whether the Supreme Court was in session, but I doubt it. Jill and are supposed to meet up for dinner. Then on the 4th, I believe Jill is basically planning. I know she mentioned a concert of some sort, and of course fireworks over the Potomac!

I've gotten part of NYC planned out. I fly into NYC on Thursday morning, going to drop my stuff off at the hotel and go sightseeing in the city. Thursday night I'm going to see Rent at 8pm. Friday I'm going to see about getting up nice and early and heading to the Rockefeller Center for the Today Show. That may not happen should I choose to actually sleep instead...and there's a good possibility of that happening. Friday I'm heading over to Battery Park to hop the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Then sometime after I leave there I'll be heading over to the Empire State Building. I want to hit the observatory there before sundown so I can get a good view of the city, and then watch the sunset and see the city light up. Saturday I haven't quite planned out yet...but I'll figure that out soon hopefully. That and the day I come back from Israel, but I may be too tired to do much of anything.

Still don't know exactly where I'll be going in Israel. I have an idea, but don't know for sure...

I'm excited!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Still haven't heard anything official about going to Israel. I e-mailed them earlier in the week and they told me they were buying tickets this week and I should know by Friday. Still waiting...oyy. If I don't hear from them by tomorrow, I'll be e-mailing them again. I think there's a good chance I'm going, but I don't want to buy plane tickets and such without knowing for sure, especially cause I'm only guessing the trip leaves out of NYC.

If it does, my plans have changed a bit. I finally got a hold of Jill; she's in DC doing an internship right now. If everything goes as planned, I would fly from Las Vegas to Washington DC on July 2nd. I'd spend until July 5th in DC (meaning July 4th in DC!!!! How cool would that be?!?!?!), then fly to NYC and spend 2 nights there until my trip to Israel leaves on July 7th. I'd spend July 7th through the 17th in Israel, coming back to NYC on the 17th, spending the night and then flying back to Vegas.

I found a perfect combination of flights, but I can't book it until I know I'm confirmed, so I'm hoping the price doesn't go up by the time I know...oyy. The flights I'm looking at are only $348 total, which includes LAS to DC, DC to NYC and NYC to LAS. But I have to wait...so hopefully I'll know by tomorrow at the latest and be able to book the trip.

Once I hear, I'm sure I will report to everyone. Pretty sure I'll be going, but don't know for sure... we shall see...."

"event","If anyone is interested in signing up for Netflix, I got some free month-long trial offers in the mail that I don't need since I already have Netflix...so if you want to try it, let me know...I've got four of them.

Still haven't found out whether I'm going to Israel or not. I had a second phone interview with them on Tuesday and they said it would be another two weeks before I find out. It's really frustrating trying to plan an extension and possible other side trips. Arghhh...hopefully I'll find out soon so I can book my flight and decide whether I want to do Egypt or something, or maybe New York...oyyy I dunno. But first I have to find out whether I'm going or not... Blah...

Nothing much happening. Just busy with work. Going for a hike later today. Yay fun.

"event","We totally pulled it off!!!! WOOOHOOO!!!!! I've been wanting to do this since Janelle was still the manager because it would've been absolutely hilarious to see her reaction because of how much she <i>hated</i> Post-it Notes. But anyways, I was considering doing it for April Fool's Day but figuredi t wouldn't work out until I randomly remembered that Alana was coming in for graveyard tonight. So, as soon as 5p hit, I flew out the door at work and drove over to the Wal-Mart and bought 3 packages of 1200-count Post-it Notes. I flew back (took me about 15 minutes in total) and, with Edgar and Alana S.'s help, we got to work. We began plastering Alana's office with hundreds and hundreds of Post-it Notes. It worked out perfectly cause we had 4 colors, so one wall was all blue, one pink, one yellow and one green. I even started to put some on the ceiling and had Post-its hanging from the metal bars between the tiles, but most of them fell down. But regardless: her desk. her chairs, her filing cabinet, her calendar, her computer, her telephone, her Bamboo plant, her printer...everything. Post-its <i>everywhere</i>. It was absolutely hilarious. I actually had a hike to go to at 6:45p, so I bailed and left Edgar and Alana S. to do the rest of the work. I told them I'd be back by 9:30p to get some more, if needed and help finish....but I ended up not even getting done the hike until 10p. So I flew out of the trail area, ran into Wal-Mart (again!) and bought a disposable camera (no more Post-its were needed) and flew to work as quickly as I could. I was hiding in the office behind her chair to get a picture of her reaction when she came in. It seemed like it was taking forever cause all I could hear was Alana and Edgar and Alana S. chatting it up outside the door. She finally opened the door and just started laughing. It was the greatest thing ever! Ok, not ever, but it was way too much fun. We're keeping our work up until Monday so everyone at the desk can see it, as well as Eric. I got a whole camera full of pictures, so I'll probably post them in case someone wants to check out our work.

And now? Time for sleep, since I have to be back at work at 11am!

Woooooo that was fun!!"

I dropped my car off at the mechanic again. I took it over to get a freon charge on my A/C because it hasn't worked well (Read: At all) since the tail end of last summer and I just haven't done anything about it. But then when I was driving aroudn on Tuesday I nearly died from the heat, so I toko it over and goti t fixed. It worked for two days and then started blowing hot air again...so I took it back to have them find the leak that probably exists that they missed the first time. Oyyy...

My phone did the strangest thing earlier. I was checking the time and foudn that it randomly had skipped back an hour. I couldn't figure out why or how...so me being the master and fixing things...shut the phone off, turned it back on and all was well. Haha...go me.

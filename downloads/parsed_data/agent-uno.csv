I have zero motivation at work, yet I still do my job. More proof I can do this in my sleep. Or hungover. Which I've been doing a good deal since the day I put in my notice.

I just want it all to be done with. JFK said it right that ""we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard."" The right thing to do and the hard thing to do are usually the same. If it was easy it wouldn't be worth doing.

What do I mean by that? Well, I do and did want to leave on good terms. I did enjoy my job, except for the parts that I absolutely fucking hated. Plus, I don't want to fuckover the people that I work(ed) with. So I put in my two-weeks, which IS afterall a courtesy, and not requirement. I did it to be gracious. And it's a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. So it may not be easy, but it's what I feel is right.

Fuck it! I'm sick of talking about my resignation!

Had class tonight. We got our tests back from last weeks Astronomy test. My first test I got 86%, this tests results were 77%. WTF? I am better than that! After going over the test in class tonight, almost every one that I got wrong was due to bad phrasing/wording from the terrible teacher who learned English as her second (at least) language. I debated (along with half the class) but she persisted. Looks like I'm gonna have to get a few more cups of coffee in me before the next test and the final so that I can go over the questions with a fine-tooth comb. 

Cuz this is bullshit. *shrug* Either way, I guess I'm sitting at a solid B so far.

Moving on to Religions: Studied tonight for Judiasm.....jesus! (no pun intended)....the book we're using must assume that no one in america ever attended sunday school. Moses in an arch, the burning bush, the plagues, mount sinai, the 10 commandments....... there wasn't a fucking thing that I didn't know in there except for the fact that the Pharaoh's daughter gave him the name Moses, so that name is not Hebrew, it's Egyptian. Whoopdi-ding! I prolly knew this already but simply didn't think about it.

It's the first complaint I have about the book so far, but you all know me. Well, some of you do, anyway.

Work & Class tomorrow. Work Friday. Saturday is Halloween parade (hope to attend if I can wake my ass up early enough) and then a Samhain service at the Mpls UU church. Should be interesting. Work Sunday and Monday, then FREEEEEEDOOOOOMMMMMM!!! Tues off, then Class Wed & Thurs, going-away party Friday, and bonfire party at home Saturday.

.....can't wait till I have nothing to do.

Back to Religions class, random question: What Religion should I do my Presentation on?"

Duke,

It is with mixed emotions that I inform you of my resignation, effective Nov 1st.

I do realize that my decision comes at a bad time for the team. Please understand that this bad timing is not, and was not my intent. I have not come to this decision lightly. I have been seriously thinking about it for the past several months, and I feel that leaving before the Holiday season starts is better for all involved, rather than putting it off.

It has been an extreme pleasure working with you, and for Apple over the past four years. As the Retail Division has grown from it's infancy into what it is today, I am glad to have been a part of it, and I do not wish to leave on bad terms. I consider myself very lucky to have been a part of Apple Retail since the beginning, and even more lucky to have been under your management. Both the position and you yourself have taught me more than I could have thought possible about Retail and Customer Service, and I am very grateful for the experience and wisdom, and am happy knowing that I will carry on those things in my future endeavors.

My reasons leading up to this decision are many, but in the end it comes down to one: I love the company, I love the product, and I did love the job, but lately my heart has simply not been present in my work. You have told me in the past that working for Apple is an ""At-Will"" position, and I agree with you completely. So if my heart is no longer in my work, that is not only not good for myself, but more importantly, it is not fair to the team.

Due to these reasons, I feel that it would be best if I stepped down from my position.

Regards, with Thanks and Admiration,
-Scott"

Sounds like karma bit me in the ass on this one. Don't care. Show kicked ass! Hear that? That show kicked karmas ass! So fuck you, karma!

Thankfully I have a few days to figure out how to get it fixed, prolly end up doing it myself, and I can borrow my roomies van in the meantime.

"event","Found a way to see NiN tonight anyway. Fucking amazing! Better than sex! Seats were awesome. About 50 feet away from Reznor! Bastard cut his hair! Oh wait....shit....speaking of which, tonight was the first night that I was sorry I cut my hair. I wanted to headbang! It felt weird not having it.

I haven't felt that fucking thru-and-thru good in a long time. I needed it. It was a blast to just scream my fucking lungs out to the music that got me thru the hard times in life, hands in the air, stomping back & forth, head thrashing, worshipping good king trent by chanting his words till my throat throbbed, my ears bled, and my soul released all it's negativity into the ether. I could've died happy in the hour or so after he left stage.

The show was shorter than I had hoped for, but I'm not complaining. It would've been awesome to see him do more of his older stuff, but I was delighted by his performances of a few tracks off Hate Machine, Downward Spiral and Broken. Before tonight, I wasn't a huge fan of the latest album, but now I think I'm gonna have to give it some serious time, as a few of his performances were amazing.

It was also really fuckin cool to see how a drummer actually plays some NiN riffs. I've always wondered. He had a mostly analog set, with some electric drums and a couple triggers, and they then must've looped in some of the background riffs on some songs, cuz he clearly wasn't playing some of it. But for some songs that I have not for the life of me been able to figure out how a human plays, I finally was able to see it tonight. Amazing that this drummer has only been with the tour for a few acts so far. He was great!

Le sigh.....I should've gone to see NiN for the first time years ago. But now I'm gonna go try and sleep.....wish me luck :)"

Between an email from Duke (my GM) the other day, and a store-meeting tonight, things seem to be looking a little up compared to before, and I am feeling a little refreshed in regards to how he views his subordinates, namely me.

After discussing it with one of my closer buddies (thanks, Gonzo! Was good beyond words to see you again, as short as the visits were) and thinking about it a bit more, I realize that I shouldn't be as close-minded and short-sighted on the whole thing as I have been letting myself be lately.

It's gonna take some time, and I should know more tomorrow, and even more in the coming weeks, but I think I'm gonna try to stick it out for now. A month or two down the road, I may be back where I'm at. But then again, things may work themselves out.

Either way, I do plan on letting my GM know about my attitude lately, and that he & the whole situation are of the primary causes of it. Maybe it'll help? I don't know.

Stay tuned!"

"event","The guest-speaker for my religions class tonight was for Buddhism. Weird. I've read up on it enough, and we talked about all the usual stuff you'd imagine with Buddhism. Ego, Poverty, Monks, Meditation, Karma, and so on.

Then the class started throwing out questions about reincarnation. The class being almost exclusively Christian-based, you can imagine the types of questions. Then the guest-speaker brought something up that I felt stupid for not thinking about before: The idea of reincarnation extrapolated with parallel realities! Holy-mind-fuck, Batman!

Instead of thinking of reincarnation as the History of Your Soul in the general sense, in a linear time-line, think about it as cross-existence all at one time. Or think about it as moving from one existence to the next, into a different but parallel universe! For those of you who have seriously thought about parallel realities before.....wow... Fucking wicked. And it makes just as much sense, if not perhaps more so.

Our traveling of the ""Great Wheel"" of enlightenment, as he referred to it as, it makes you really wonder where you are currently at, in a lot more ways than you might have previously thought.

*shrug*

Anyway. Towards the end of class, he had us all sit on the floor and meditate for 10 minutes straight. Have you ever done this? It's a short period, but yet not. 

Very interesting experience. Once I assumed the correct posture, all was cool for the first few minutes. My eyes went somewhere between open and closed, and my mind started to relax to the point of not thinking. I lost focus on my breath-count, and pretty much everything else, turning off my active conscience. Then my leg started to fall asleep, and I was brought back. Changed positions and continued. All going cool and well. Started to feel like I would fall asleep.

And then outta nowhere, I suddenly felt the need to pass-gas, a completely normal bodily function. I thought 'Fuck! I'm in a room with 30 other people, mostly women, I don't know if this is gonna make any noise or not, we're all quiet as could be, and there's a half-dozen people sitting within smelling-distance of me'.....as you can imagine, it was about as hilarious as it sounds, both inwardly (FUCK!) and outwardly (HAHAA!)

Thankfully, The Buddha smiled on my soul and the feeling subsided shortly thereafter. And oh MAN did I let one rip when I got home!"

"event","Ever since my army brother got back from Iraq this past spring, we seem to be getting along a lot better than we used to. He has always been the black-sheep of the family, myself being somewhere directly in-between him and my oldest brother. I'm not sure what has changed, but I am happy that it has.

I've gone out for food or drinks with him more times in the past four months than I ever have in my life. The convo is always interesting. Sometimes we talk about the war, other times about life.

A few nights ago I mentioned to him over beer & food a book that I had heard about and picked up. It's called ""The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell: An Accidental Soldier's Account of the War In Iraq"". He told me that when I was done reading it I should loan it to him. I sheepishly admitted that I hadn't started reading it yet.

So today on my day off, I slept late, went to Cheapo for my bi-monthly music fix (new 30 seconds to mars, and another Floyd album I didn't own yet), then retired to Denny's by myself and started reading said book.

Barely touching my food, 130-some pages into it in a few hours, and I'm 2/3rds done. Altho so far it is not as good as the reviews seemed to indicate (IMHO), it has definitely been a lesson into what he lived with for his tour over there.

It's weird. While I was around page 50 I heard some of the geeky-regulars at Denny's talking about the war. I know it's obvious, but I am still surprised that the war is on everyone's minds. At that point I pulled up my laptop and started importing some pics my bro sent me while he was away into my iPhoto app. I took a brake from reading once the import finished, and slowly went over them.

There is a chapter in the book that hints about the author picking up a stray dog, and then the pics my bro sent me had a stray dog in them, eating their leftovers.

So far, the most gruesome part of the book is the author remembering an incident where the drunks and beer & whiskey sellers along the Tigris had an attempted car-jacking. Now remember, alcohol-consumption is a direct violation of the Qur'an, so I found this particularly interesting. Apparently during the car-jacking by the locals, the american soldiers heard two shots fired. The soldiers fired back at these law-breakers. The first one was killed. The second took a shot to the groin.

Once the Iraqi paramedics got there, it was realized that the man suffered a .22 caliber M16 shot that hit him in the tip. It traveled up, bounced off the pelvic-bone, and exited out one of his testicles. Apparently, the American-Medic that also responded radioed back ""How the hell do you bandage this sort of thing?"" and got a good laugh from the Infantrymen.

They also found out that this man had just been married that night. The Iraqi paramedics thought this was a terrible thing. As I cringed reading it, so did I. But then the author says how his fellow-soldiers thought ""Well maybe you shouldn't have been trying to do a car-jacking on your wedding night"", and for some reason, it made sense, and I couldn't disagree.

Fucked up as it is. No matter how much I hate the war. Even this author says he didn't agree with the war. But they fought anyway. Their war wasn't politics. They had no say in the matter. Just had to carry out their duty, such as it was.

The book is brutal, raw, and honest. The Author talks about how Command breaks down. How lowly-soldiers get blamed for things their superiors should get hanged for. How alcohol is a bad way to get high in the 130 degree heat, but morphine has less side-affects, and drugs are sought-out by most soldiers. How rumor spreads faster than fact, and career-men are more interested in politics & glory than making sure their subordinates are safe.

I haven't finished the book yet, but I'd encourage anyone wanting a serious report from the war to pick it up. It's a quick read, so far. Though I am not sure it's worth the $24 hardcover price-tag."

This has been a long time coming, and is with many mixed feelings. I'm sick of retail, customer service, and to a great extent, the computer industry as a whole.

Reasons are many.... I am sick of the customers never-ending complaints, despite the few & far between thankful ones. Sick of incompetent coworkers. Sick of stupid policies. Sick of the hours, especially. I want my weekends and evenings back. I'm sick of coming home and it taking three hours or more just to feel at peace with myself due to the stress. I'm sick of not sleeping unassisted. I'm sick of the pain in my stomach that only happens on days when I work. I'm sick of people trying to tell me how to do the job that I've been doing for over four years. I'm sick of waiting for a promotion that was promised to me 10 months ago, and I MIGHT get in November. I'm sick that I just found out someone who was hired a year ago is making more money than me, despite my three years tenure before them. I'm sick of doing my mgrs job for them. I'm sick of being the go-to person for everyone and everything in the store, just because I've done it all before and have worked there longer than all but one other person. I'm sick of consistently having 12 days worth of work to do, and being expected to get it done in 7, including interruptions. I am sick of watching my general manager get rich off all the hard work of his subordinates, with his eleven couches and six full-baths in his mansion, not to mention his boat and his golf-cart that he bought just because ""the neighbors have one"". I am seething with animosity for his unborn children, and laughing at him when he declines coffee, tobacco and alcohol, him not-quite admitting that his sperm-count is low. With all this stress, is it any wonder why, Duke ol' buddy?

I want to learn a new trade. Electrician, Auto-Mechanic, Carpenter. It's funny. I used to want to learn a study, not a trade. Study of theology, history, astronomy, physics, or whatever else interested me. I still would like to learn that. But life seems to not work that way. The Library of Alexandria burned a long time ago, and no King sends for scholars to make him & his country look good anymore. So I am stuck taking a class here and there on the topics that truly interest me, while trying to figure out how to get by.

Anyone have any advice to offer someone who wants to quit with no Plan-B?"

"event","Change is....new.

Alright, so I finally started school in the end of August. First time back in a classroom in nine long years. Astronomy & World Religions. Who would've thought that I would hate the Astronomy class and love the Religions class? And the reason for each is the instructor.

As an Astronomy buff over the years I know I shouldn't expect an Intro-To class to be hugely informative for me. I've skimmed thru the book though, and there are things that I either don't know, or need the refresher on. I love the topic. So why do I hate it? The teacher is terrible! Everyone in the class thinks so. In four weeks we've covered only two chapters. WTF? *shrug* Oh well. Hopefully it improves. I was tempted to drop this class & take it again with another instructor down the road, but a grant paid for it, so I figure I should stick it thru. If nothing else, it'll ""build character"" I guess.

My Comparative World Religions class on the other hand has become the highlight of my week. The instructor is truly amazing! Every week I am psyched (yes, I used the word psyched). The guy is hilarious, yet down to earth. He has a doctorate in theology, and he teaches at a friggin community college! Go figure. He knows is shit. Each week we have to read a chapter about a new religion, and then the following class he has a speaker (usually a priest/equivalent or a teacher) come in to give us a presentation on that religion and answer any questions. Tonight was Islam, the speaker was equally amazing as my professor, and as you could imagine there were LOTS of questions, but I think I have a much better understanding of Muslims now.

In addition to all the guest-speakers, we also have to attend two non-familiar religious services and write a personal-account of the event. We can choose from a long list, and I may decide to do more than two, just for the hell of it. I am hoping to attend a Wicca ceremony, maybe for Solstice or Samhain. I also want to visit either a Mosque or Synagogue, or maybe a Native American service. We'll see.

I'm really looking forward to these outside assignments. I've always said that if/when I have kids I want to expose them to all types of religion, by doing exactly what this assignment is. The ""final exam"" for this class is that we have to prepare a 20-25minute presentation on a religion of our choice, and give it to the class. This idea scares the hell out of me, as I am not a good public speaker, but I know I'll get thru it. I have to.

Moving on... my good friend Adam finally left for NY a week ago. I'm gonna miss that bastard! I kept wracking my brain trying to think of a fitting going-away gift that would actually mean something to him. I finally had a halogen bulb explode inside my brain, and decided to sketch a picture that I took while we were in Vegas last Feb. I haven't sketched anything in over 10 years, but for some reason last fall I had picked up a sketchpad on a whim. So I pulled it out, and after an hour had a pretty damned good picture in front of me. Finished it the next night, asked my roommies for their opinions (they were impressed), put it in a frame along with a bit of cash, and wrapped it up.

I still can't believe I was able to do that good of a sketch after a decade of not drawing a damned thing. I'm still not sure if it was the money that pleased him, but when I gave it to him he seemed to really love it. For about five minutes he just kept staring at it and saying ""Wow"", mixed with a few ""I can't believe it""s. Since he went to school for art, I finally asked him to give me his real artistic opinion and not just be nice to me. He told me that he knew other artists who'd been drawing for years who couldn't have done as fine a job.

Of course, my negative side wants to say he was just saying it was good, but even if he was, I don't care. *I* was proud of it. I just wish I would've scanned it before I gave it to him. Hopefully I'll get a picture soon, at least.

And on another note of change, my long-time friend and roommate Katy, who WAS engaged to my landlord, has recently moved out. It'll be weird having her not live here anymore, especially when I will be living with her Ex (whom I've become friends with over the past year)."

"event","Hey Jen,

Since I don't know how else to get in contact with you short of responding to a livejournal msg (which I'd rather not do), I chose to contact you via myspace, and post this as an open-journal to my own LJ page.

I briefly spoke to Adam tonight and mentioned the LJ stuff.

Despite the fact that I posted to Adam's LJ to extend the invite for you to come over for a bonfire tonight, and despite him not replying to say anything, yet you replying in the way that you did, the invite still stood, and I meant it. You could have come over. I wanted you to. I so rarely see the two of you together that I thought it'd be cool, especially with BOTH of you leaving for NY soon.

I know that Adam has a lot of friends and acquaintences, and I know that some of them treat him like dirt. I know some never call him, but then when they do, they expect him to about-face whatever he is doing, so they can spend time with him. I know some insult him, or poke fun at him.

I don't know if you think I am one of them or not. To be honest, I don't care. Similarly, regardless of whatever you meant by your five LJ responses (and yes, I saw all five of them, including the ones with personal insults directed at me), I also don't care. They're your opinions, and you're entitled to them.

I would like to ask a number of questions in regards to the LJ comment(s) which you left. But, because I know that arguing online only leads to further arguments and more complications, I will not.

So I will close this email by saying: I don't know where the hositility came from, but I wish you and your loved one well on your travels. I hope that as little that can go wrong does, and that the gods smile upon you. Your love for eachother can carry you a long way, and I hope that the friends you will have can carry you the rest of the way. You are both lucky to have found eachother, and since I am friends with Adam, I am glad that he has found someone whom he puts so much faith into. And I am sure that works both ways. I hope that someday down the road, I may visit the two of you, and that you both will welcome me for a night or two into your home during my travels.

Whereas my post to Adam's LJ was sarcastic, this email is sincere,

Your Love's Friend,

Add into this mix a handful of new seasonal employees who aren't, umm...seasoned, yet? And it leads to every day starting a project that should only take 30 minutes, getting interrupted every five minutes with something else that takes 15 to assist-with or do for someone, so each of your primary tasks can take hours, and you have plenty of them to complete, but no dedicated time to complete them.

A lot of frustration and annoyance, especially when you tell one person to tell another that you have too much work to do something and your mgr then tells you to do it anyway.

I digress..... just after my lunch today, I get an IM from a very old friend of mine, who has lived in Denver for the past 4 or 5 years, and I haven't seen in a year and a half. Not abnormal. But then he asks if I want to grab a beer with him tonight. Huh? He's sitting in the Denver Airport and his flight will be in around 10pm.

Hell yeah!

So the rest of the day I was left all giddy looking forward to seeing him, and stuck dealing with work. Made the day even longer and more annoying.

Finally get home, get a TM that he's been delayed. Put a pizza in the oven, and then he says he's all set to hook up. Scarf down pizza in five minutes, then go pick him up.

Head out to Bennegins for two-for-ones. I had already called a couple friends to see if they could meet up with us. They do after a bit. We sit back and talk about old times for a couple hours. Stories none of us have thought about for 10 years or more. Reminisce about our younger days, and all feel a little younger while realizing that we're not old yet. Catch up on life events, eachother's families, friends, etc. All in all, a good time.

But far too short. A few years cannot be summed up in a few hours. Alas, altho he'll be in MN for the next few days, he's gonna be out of town with his fiance'. I can't argue with that. Says he might be able to hang out again Sunday night before leaving for Denver again on Monday. I hope it'll work out that way, but can't argue with it if it doesn't.

Anyway, made for the highlight of my week! Feeling all nostalgic, and such. Just wish we could've spent more time catching up. Hopefully things will work out for Sunday.

Good to see you, brutha!"

"event","The Ticker read ""NO MORE EXCUSES"" as all four of the greatest members of Pink Floyd took stage for the first time in over twenty years, Roger Waters finally putting his differences with David Gilmour behind him for one of ten concerts conducted simultaneously.

The Live 8 event on July 2nd was organized by Bob Geldof, the same man who played Pink in the movie The Wall over twenty years ago, and who also organized the 1985 Live Aid benefit concerts in London & Philadelphia to benefit Ethiopia.

But this time the concert was not a benefit: It was to raise public awareness about the G8 Summit being held in Scotland by eight of the most powerful leaders in the world. The issue: to forgive third-world African Nations of Past Debt, and to improve & increase Aid to them, helping to improve their ways of life, and promote trade with those nations.

But this time Geldof went beyond anybody's expectations in terms of scale, and began the largest organized event in human history...

Announced on May 31st, Geldof initially announced six concerts, being in London, England, Philadelphia, USA, Berlin, Germany, Toronto, Canada, Paris, France, and Rome, Italy. Along with this announcement, he called for a million people to march on Edinburg (where the G8 Summit was to be held) on the day of the concerts, and asked people to sign an online Petition List to the G8 Leaders.

On June 7th, a separate concert was announced for Edinburgh on July 6th as the climax to the rally, labelled ""Edinburgh: The Final Push"". 

On June 15th, in response to criticism that the announced concerts were too ""white"", a 7th concert is announced for June 2nd at Cornwall, England, featuring all African Artists. On June 16th, Geldof announces two more concerts to be held at Johannesburg, South Africa and Tokyo, Japan. On June 27th, a tenth show is announced for Moscow, Russia.

On June 22nd, along with the BBC and dozens of Television and Radio stations across the globe, MTV/VH1 announce they will broadcast all of the Live 8 Concerts simultaneously. July 2nd, AOL Music begins broadcasting all 10 shows via Windows Media Streaming on the internet simultaneously, the first time an event of this size has been broadcast on-line. Between all the broadcasters, early estimates show the global broadcast coverage at 85% - Nearly 5.5 Billion people. Later estimates revealed that approximately 2.5 to 3 billion people actually witnessed the event during it's live broadcast in some fashion or another - approximately 40% of the world's population.

Wow!

At the end of the day on July 2nd, more than one-thousand musicians had performed at the ten concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks, 2,000 radio networks, and at least several online networks. More than one-million tickets combined were given away via lottery to all of the shows. Some ended up on eBay, before Geldof begged the auction site to pull them, and even suggested that Hackers try to take down the site to prevent people from ""scalping"" them for thousands of dollars.

Critics Criticized about the rich musicians not giving their own money, and about the lack of african artists at the concerts. Still others thought there were better ways to convince the G8 Leaders to do what we, the public, wish them to. 

But in the end, over 2 billion people saw it. At Least 2 billion people knew about it. 250,000 people marched on Edinburgh that day, 3/4ths shy of what Geldof hoped for. The final numbers aren't in yet on the Petition, but at last count it was at 26million.

Regardless of some of the numbers not being what we all hoped for, I think we can safely say that this was one of a few moments to go down in history, for a handful of reasons.

But in the end, some of us, such as this writer, were simply glad to see Pink Floyd reunite for the first time in over twenty years, no matter what the cause. I'm just glad that it ended up being a cause I too believed in. Cuz it's pretty rare when, in our adult lives, something makes us feel as giddy as a school girl. But when I finally heard that the band took stage as a group, and then when I finally saw the video 24 hours later, there is nothing that can describe my feelings. It was like seeing the Beatles reuinited, minus all the obvious miracle crap. But it was a miracle to me, nonetheless.

To see Roger Waters and David Gilmour on the same stage, performing music they both have done before, giving big smiles to eachother, and the other band-members while playing their set, and all seeming to enjoy being on-stage together......well shit...... no offense to Africa, but.....that was worth more than anything I could've payed for a ticket that I couldn't buy, but would have anyway. 

I agree with the cause, I commend Bob Geldof for the amazing act he was able to pull off, and I think the world has grown a little closer as a result of all this. Additionally, I hope our G8 Leaders do the right thing. 

But for Pink Floyd reuniting? None of the rest matters to me.

After dropping my buddy Kent off and rounding the corner towards home, the familiar and unholy smell of an insidious skunk filled the air. To be nice, it could've been roadkill for all I know, but either way, it friggin stank.

I walk in the house, and am immediately tackled by two full sized dogs happy to see me, and even happier (or perhaps pissed off) to point out a third dog, less than half their size, inside a kennel in the entry-way.

Oh yeah! We agreed to watch my roommates uncle's 13 year old beagle while they went on vacation. Oh yeah! I agreed it could sleep in my room to keep her out of the way of the two much larger, much younger, and (I am about to find out) much less annoying dogs.

Sweet little Angel, or at least that's what they named her. Maybe she's homesick, I dunno. But the little bitch wouldn't stop whining the second I let her in my room. She's 13 years old, has a handful of (healing) sores on her body, a bunch of tiny fat-tumors, and my rommate tells me that a few weeks ago her eyes started bleeding. Out of nowhere. Vet fixed it, and now she's back to normal.

Normal?!? A 13 year old dog is NOT normal! I love animals, dogs especially, so don't get me wrong, but they should put this poor creature down! Out of it's misery. And they should especially do something to make her quit her whining in my room while I'm TRYING to get some crap done.

But I'm not bitter.

""Outside?"" I ask. Tail wags, whining slows. I put her outside, fending the other two dogs out of the way. She does her duty, so I figure that's it. Back in and she starts whining again.

""You want to see the other dogs?"" Tail wags, whining slows. I let the other two dogs in. They keep going after her and I call em off. They finally settle down, and that damned noise starts again. Is it illegal to wrip the voice-box out of a poor old dogs throat, I'm wondering?

So I throw the two dogs back out, and the whining continues. I try to get her to lie down, play dead, be dead, doesn't matter, just make the damned noise stop! I feel like I'm pleading with an infant that's simply throwing a tantrum, and begging ""Learn to speak, you worthless ape!"" only when I realize my mistake, and go back to simply asking her what's wrong, and realize that's not gonna do the trick either.

So I go get her kennel and bring it in. Every time I leave the room, the whining gets louder, bordering on a bark. Damn, I hate Beagles! I set it down. She sniffs around. Goes in, comes back out, then looks at me. I envision Stewart from The Family Guy, saying ""Victory is mine!"" I sit down at my desk, go back to my computer.

Then, there it is again. Soft at first, but definitely getting louder. I ignore it.

FIVE MINUTES go by, and it suddenly stops. What the fuck? Pretend you didn't notice, I think to myself. I glance over with my peripheral only. She's lying on her side, outside the kennel, calm.

Ahhh.... so those things they tell us about neglect must have all been bullshit. Just ignore it. And it will go away.

It's a good thing the past couple days have been so cool, cuz if I gotta go thru this every night for the next two weeks I think I'll change my name to Nick Nadeau and start couch-hopping till this little mutt is outta here."

"event","So I ran across an article on the internet today that I thought was both hilarious and at the same time just wrong....

Apparently Microsoft UK is putting together a contest for Teens in Britain, aged 14-17. The contest is called ""Thought Thieves"" (holy orwell, batman!), and is about Intellectual Property. The idea is that each contestant will make a short-movie, meeting key criteria as posted on their site, about how Intellectual Property Theft hurts people. Not Corporations, but people. Okay, I'm listening.

Each short-movie submitted has to have all the usual waivers, and if Microsoft finds any of the material to be questionable under Intellectual Property, Trademark, etc laws, they can disqualify you. So they encourage the kids to do their homework on the topic, I guess.

Okay. All well and good.

So what's the punch-line?

Well, in order for any contestant to win, they need to sign over the Intellectual Property Rights to their short-film to Microsoft, and are forced to WAIVE all ""moral rights as deemed by Microsoft"" to their project.

So they are using these kids to put together a short film demonizing Copyright Theft and such, so that they can (I can only assume) use these films in a fashion such as the American Military used films on VD in the 40s amongst recruits to help cut down on the problem, only for Microsoft to be (more or less) outright stealing all the rights to those films from the CHILDREN who MAKE them in the FIRST place!

And all of this coming from a company who (almost admittedly) outright stole/copied every single one of the products that they have made billions on over the past 20+ years!

And on top of all of this, who the fuck in Microsoft thought it would be a good PR move to use the title ""Thought Thieves""? The phrase is so closely resembling that of ""Thought Crime"" and ""Thought Police"" from 1984, that I can only think some well-read punk at Microsoft said it as a joke, and some moronic supervisor thought it was a great idea. I just wish some American media company would pick it up and run with it, poking fun the entire way.

Typically I bitch about the cultural problems in THIS country, but I guess that in order for a corporation that's bigger than any government in the world to pull something like this, they have to go to Europe.

When will people come to the realization that Intellectual Property has it's place, but that place does not extend to Corporate Fascism backed up the Countries and Governments that use their products because they fear being charged more money for what is already obscenely expensive due the Intellectual Property laws that were passed and exist in said country, and were then forced upon the less fortunate and poorer countries and citizens?

"event","Ya know....I've been a net user since the dawn of the web, when Mosaic was one of the only browsers around, and can remember when Explorer didn't exist at all, and Netscape was the new kid on the block. I had my first FTP site in '93, my first web site in '94, and in '95 was one of the only people I knew who used an animated gif for a background image, long before Flash was even dreamed up. Hell, I still prefered to dialup via Term rather than PPP till 98, cuz I preferred the advantages it gave me. Call me old-school...

So why did it take me this long to subscribe to blogs and online journals? Your guess is as fucking good as mine. Maybe it's cuz I figure why the hell does anyone care what I would have to say?

So following that thread (pun intended, for those still faimiliar with the layover from Usenet days, which I'm happy to report aren't dead yet), I finally decided to start a livejournal site, with that whole idea in mind: Who the fuck cares what I have to say? The point being to say it, just to see what little pissants (other than my friends) ever take notice, if any, which I presume will be very few indeed.

And if my friends actually are interested in what I have to say online (gawd knows they all think I talk too much IRL as it is!), then so be it....

So I welcome all you little whipper-snappers to my journal.....and a g'day to old friends!

See ya in the funny-papers....

P.S. As a side note: just as all nicknames I've ever had, I never picked this one. It was thrust upon me by those close to me at a given time in my life, as most nicknames do, in fact, originate for all. It may have been a true dedication to the admiration those said friends felt towards me at the time, or it could have just as likely been an inside joke between them to poke fun at me, at my unknowing expense, especially since I had very little to do with the memes and ideas behind its creation. All I can say is, that despite my moderate paranoia on the subject, they seemed to be saying it lovingly at the time, so I am left with no alternative than to assume positive intent. Cheers!

P.P.S. In the event that my good friends were making fun of me, it might be in their best interest to let me know about it sooner, rather than later, so that I can tell them all to bugger off today and be done with it, rather than finding out about it decades from now, and then being forced to torture them in some manner which I have yet to think of.

P.P.P.S. As a reminder to said friends, if they choose to let me find out about their negative, hurtful, and joking purposes behind said name sometime after my health has begun to fail me, please keep in mind that I will have already set up such devices necessary to torture them after I am already bed-ridden. As a secondary reminder, please keep in mind that I am just anal enough to do so decades in advance.

P.P.P.P.S. As an explanation for this little tangent, I would like to state for the record that I have been in the process of reading the five-book Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy trilogy, as well as another English Author's book entitled A Short History of Nearly Everything, all of which have a very similar British style and dry-humour, and has put me in a rather peculiarly interesting mood lately. I don't recommend it."

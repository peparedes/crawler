"event","So I went to http://www.colorquiz.com/ and was shocked to see how accurately my life was analyzed simply by clicking on colors.  You should try it.  Here are my results...


Your Existing Situation

      Seeks to express the need for identification in a sensitive and intimate atmosphere where esthetic or emotional delicacy can be protected and nurtured.


Your Stress Sources

      Feels that life has far more to offer and that there are still important things to be achieved--that life must be experienced to the fullest. As a result, she pursues her objectives with a fierce intensity that will not let go of things. Becomes deeply involved and runs the risk of being unable to view things with sufficient objectivity, or calmly enough; is therefore in danger of becoming agitated and of exhausting her nervous energy. Cannot leave things alone and feels she can only be at peace when she has finally reached her goal.


Your Restrained Characteristics

      Very exacting in the standards she applies to her choice of a partner and seeking a rather unrealistic perfection in her sex life.

      Circumstances are restrictive and hampering, forcing her to forgo all joys and pleasures for the time being.


Your Desired Objective

      Wants to make a favorable impression and be recognized. Needs to feel appreciated and admired. Sensitive and easily hurt if no notice is taken of her or if she is not given adequate acknowledgment.


Your Actual Problem

      Afraid that she may be prevented from achieving the things she wants and therefore demands that others should recognize her right to them."

"event","waiting, waiting, waiting... I'll never get a job, this is the thought that constantly passes through my mind.  I've been sitting around my room for the last month at least sending out applications and interviewing, hoping that someone will like me and call me and give me a job.  This hasn't been my most productive summer.  I've felt depressed and useless.  But then today, when I had felt like giving up, I got a call from the principal of the Renaissance Academy, an Edison Charter School in Phoenixville.  I was a little shocked because I had given up on that school but the principal called me from her vacation to tell me that indeed they have a math vacancy and they want me!!!  I was so excited I thought I was going to pee myself.  She told me about the salary and benefits and training and I wanted to tell her right then and there that I wanted the job but I held my composure and told her that I needed to call her back.  She gave me her cell number and asked that I call her back before 4, it was about 1:00 then.  So I called my loved ones and told them the news.  I called the other school I had been waiting to hear from and told them I was offered a position and I needed to know if they were interested in me, they couldn't tell me so I told them I was sorry and that they could take me out of consideration.  Then I called the principal back, she was actually on the beach when I called her back to accept the job.  She sounded excited and told me her ""business manager"" would be calling me shortly.  Not 2 minutes had passed and I received the call, he wanted me to come in and sign some papers and schedule my training.  So I've signed a contract, I have a job and I'll be teaching 9th and 10 graders starting in August.  Oh and don't try to find me from July 19-25, I'll be training for my new job, in New Orleans!!!  So I guess I had a good day today, maybe. :)"

"event","So my entire existance this week was dedicated to finding a job and getting my application out to as many schools as possible.  I had to look up school district info, make lists of the materials I needed to send each school, then I made 185 copies including applications and resumes and clearances and transcripts and letters of recomendation and Praxis scores, I got envelopes and labels, I made individualized letters of interest for each school, and finially I had everything ready around 5:00pm yesterday but that is when the post office closed so I decided that today I would send out my mass mailing to 14 area school districts.  So I went to the post office and when I got there I saw a sign on the door that said they were closed in mourning of the late President Reagan.  Everywhere I go, everything I do, I see or hear something about him.  I guess I never realized how important he was until all this came about.  In conclusion, I will have to wait until tomorrow to send out my mailing.  At least I tried to do something today, it's more than I have been doing lately."

BLUE:
At work or in school: I like to be with people, sharing with them, inspiring them, and helping them. I work and learn best when I can take into consideration people and the human element. I flourish in an atmosphere of cooperation.
With friends: I always look for perfect love. I am very romantic, and I enjoy doing thoughtful things for others. I am affectionate, supportive and a good listener.
With family: I like to be happy and loving. I am very sensitive to rejection from my family and to family conflicts. I really like to be well thought of and need frequent reassurance. I love intimate talks and warm feelings."

"event","so i'm a total insomniac...it that the right spelling? .. hummm...oh well.  doesn't everyone just hate those people who can just lay down and go to sleep cause they know they have things to do and they need the sleep. or those people who can wake up in the morning....i'm so not a morning person. sux for me cause i need to get better at it for next semester. i'm excited that i will have more to do next semester but i'm nervious. i'm so used to this lazy-ass schedule i have right now that i'm not sure i remember how to handle a busy one.    ehhh i'll figure it out i guess.

so lets see, i have stupid event of the evening, an off-the-wall-totally-unexpected event of the weekend, and someone who has left me wondering....

lets start with off-the-wall: saturday night i go out to a bar on beale, the one we usually go to. and i see this guy that is there every weekend i think. last time i was there we talked and made jokes and it was cool. it was good, there was not hitting on for either of us, just cool ppl. well this time it was cool again till the end when he seemed less joke-like and more serious. i tried to brush it off cause i hate being in that awkward(sp) moment of ...hummm what is this exactly. but when i was leaving and saying good bye he wrapped his arm around me and have me a peck kiss....i was so shocked there are no words.. no phone numbers were exchanged so ..i mean...i have no idea...whatever...right??? 

now for the stupid..nathan, the dumb ass, is texting me agian saying he misses me and wants me to visit...he says he doesnt want to be with anyone right now .... he doesn't see anything wrong with stringing me along till he figures out what he wants.... and he wants me to come over after the mean shit he said....is he fucking joking? i told him no, i deserve respect, yadayadayada....and told him goodnight! i'm too nice to tell him to fuck off but it is totally what i'm thinking...how stupid does he think i am...how stupid does he have to be to think i'm gonna keep coming back to someone who says ""i dont' wnat you""  fuck off nathan, for real!!!

and the wondering...zippedpinhead...i have no idea who you are ..... i hate not knowing...


goodnight goodnight   ..... oh please God let sleep come......"

"event","Thank you to zippedpinhead. i don't know who you are but i appreciate the words. 

So i finally did something my mom always gave advice to do. She always said if someone really hurt you write them a letter that tells everything, how you feel, how they hurt you, all that stuff. then jsut throw it away and be done with it. move on and be happy. So i did jsut that. i wrote a letter and i threw it away and i really dont care. it sounds stupid but she is right. who ever hurt you doesn't deserve to know how bad it was for you. it was good to write out all the things but i'm glad i didnt' give it to him. i had the note for a couple of days and considered giving it to him but i'm done with him so it doesnt' matter anymore. i'm happy and i feel such relief.

so i have this paper that i'm writing for stupid marketing. it is no fun at all. sometimes paper are at least interesting cause of the topic but not this one. i think it is jsut causee i'm not so fond of marketing in general. it's like management, it seems so obvious. i still wish i could jsut philosophize forever. but i would be so poor and miserable. i dont wnat to be rich or anythign but i want to be comfy. Matt is helping me with my paper so it should be great. i want an A in the class but i think i'm only gonna get a B. oh well that's bettr than  a C or D or F. ;)

my sis is finally gonna get a land line so we can call her lazy ass. she has a cell phone but they really arent dependable all the time. and i know how my sis works. it's too convient for her to be able to jsut turn it of and say 'wow service must be really bad up here daddy i didn't know you've been calling for 3 days strait'. she is the bad daughter. it is so funny sometimes. i will always remember her saying ""ok, so we need to get our story strait."" so funny. i'm like ""lacey, seems like the truth is a pretty strait story and you usually cant fuck that up. but lacey does like to keep her secrets, i jsut like to keep it real with the folks. i try not to lie. i went through a phase where it was the only choice they gave me but on a regular basis i will be honest with the rents.

anyway, boring topic. but i'm out....gotta get back to that stupid paper....."

"event","i was in a pretty good mood on monday. i told nathan, the guy that wanted to talk to me, i wanted to come see him play b-ball on wednesday. he said 'no, dont' come'. that pissed me off. so then i was gonna go anyway to piss him of and show him i can do whatever i want. but i didnt' get to go.  so tonight (thurs) i finally talk to him again and i have to tell him to call me back later. Finally i call him back and he won't answer. he texts me that he doesnt' want to talk to me. this all comes out of no where. i tell him he needs to make a decision on if he wants to talk to me at all or not. finally it comes down to him saying he doesn't want me at all. well, fine. i say i'll leave you alone, you leave me alone. he trys to say sorry and i jsut tell him his sorry means nothing after all that happened and all the time i wasted on him. he keeps saying sorry like 3 more times and i keep saying leave me alone. even his friend texts me hes sorry. ok so i think its over and whatever. but no! it's not. i get a text from him asking why i was texting his friend, but i wasn't!! basically it all comes down to alot of 'forget you' 'you are fucked up' and 'delete my number'....yadayadayada. 

this is what i get for giving someone i didn't really like a chance. never again. this is so stupid. i jsut want to be happy and have fun. all this drama is really not worth my time. 

i want to go out and enjoy the time i have left in college. i will have fun regardless of other people and what they want. i will study and graduate knowing my future will be filled with success. nobody will get me down anymore. i will not let anyone have any kind of hold over me. people can do and say what they want but i am who i am and will always be true to that.

"event","so i have the greatest friends the world could ask for. i really do. i mean it is not always gravy between me them but when is any human relationship 'clean'. life gets messy, but at least i have the best girl friends to do all this 'life' with. 

i'm gonnna put this in order of knowing them.

Janine is my bestfriend for fucking ever. she is my soul. she's crazy and artistic and free spirited and i'm the counter part of more controlled and organized. i like numbers and she likes art. i like to look at photos but janine can take the photos that ppl want to look at. this is the one person in the world that knows as much about me as i do. 'friendship is two bodies and one soul.' i love my janine, she is my family, my heart, my soul. 

Laura i met on regristration day the summer before freshman year of college. we werent' friends at first but we became close friends as the year progressed. she is the one person i can be completely honest with and she will jsut say 'ok, cool'. we are so honest to eachother it is disturbing at times. she is intertaining and the dirtiest happy hippie i ever met. anytime i have ever really needed her she has been there and told me the truth with nothing holding her back, she would never lie to me to save my feeling and i treasure that so much. the friend i could never live with again. 

Kelli who i lived with my freshman year and live with now. we were thrown together in a dirty dorm and from the filth grew a friendship that surprises everyone, even us at times. we are nothing alike, except for our passion, and our real life situations. we can relate to eachother on a very real level and we are the voice of reason in eachothers heads, we are the person on the other line at 3 in the morning when we are upset and have no one else to call. kelli and i can fight and in 30 minutes be laughing about the fight. we get on eachothers nerves but i honestly dont think we would have it any other way. i am kelli's number one fan and she is my number one defender. 

Mahala got stuck livin with me and laura the second year of college. it was really weird when we were getting to know eachother cause it was like talking to ourselves. we were so much alike, same birthday, same color eyes, skin, hair, same major, same dislikes and likes. it was the weirdest and funniest thing ever. as we got to know eachother we learned that although we had many similarities we had jsut as many differences and these weren't jsut differences. where we differed were complete extremes of eachother. i admire mahala for her strength and her view of life. she's my sister from another mother. 


These are my girls. these are the people i can depend on no matter what. they do not all get along or even speak to one another but they all have one thing in common. i love them all very much and would not trade any of them for anything. 

All my love to my true friends that keep  me going every day when i don't feel i have a reason. i remember i have 4 reasons that need me as much as i need them. Friendships is amazing and i am blessed!! Janine, Laura, Kelli, Mahala...love love love love."

"event","so i'm sick. thought it was alergies then i woke up at like 6 in the morning with an achie chest and sinus problems. i feel miserable and the first thing a friend of mine says when they see me is ""you are wearing the same thing i saw you last in"". ok first of you are in my appartment so i'll wear what ever the fuck i want and second i have been in bed for the past 20 hours feelin like shit i'm not really dressing for fashion when i'm going to the kitchen so i'm gonna put on what ever is right next to the bed. I mean for fucks sake!! 

i want to leave memphis so bad. i don't think there is much for me here and i don't even think the school is worth it right now. i wish i could just go somewhere else and be done with this fucking city. ever since i came here i've been miserable and i dont' see that getting much better. 

i hate this life i lead. so many people ask me where i've been cause they don't see me anymore but the truth is i dont want to be seen. i love to hang out with people but i'm not hanging out with the people i want to anymore. 

my first year here was a huge mistake. a mistake of epic porprotions(sp). and i learned so much from it but now i can't move on from it. people give you a reputation and you can never live it down. i am so much more, worth so much more, could do so much more, but not here. Memphis is my cage. i keep telling myself that it is only a year and a half more, then i can leave and never look back. but it is so much harder than that. 

i've already put my parents through hell coming to this school and in the last hour i tell them i can't stay? that would kill them but not before they kill me. 

my living situation is getting worse and worse by the minute and i liked school and classes when i knew i would see a freind but not anymore. i don't see any friends anymore. i feel like i have nothing here and am not wanted by anything/anyone here.

i dont' know what to do anymore. i'm at a loss."

But every bruse on my heart you gave me
See we tried but we fight then we cried
now it's over babe it's over babe.

When I met you I knew you would be the one
me cause looking at you made me feel kind of crazy
now what you asked I almost did it automatically
but it was nothing compared to the joy you gave me
Although I know that what we had it wasn't perfect babe
you fooled around, but see back then it didn't phase me
I thought by staying, trying to change you would be worth it babe
but now I see that trying to change you only changed me
All these tears,and all of your lies
all these years and now we're saying goodbye
it's over babe

Now I'm thinking that I never should have dealt with you
all this screaming and this yelling that we go through
raining late at night I'm sitting waiting up for you
just to tell you how I hate who you turned into
see ain't no way I'm gonna sit and take this shit from you
I'm never playing another day of being your fool
I wasted all my time on something that just wasn't true
I should have known I could never ever change you
All these tears, and all of your lies
all these years and now we're saying goodbye it's over babe

I'll never forget what you did to me so I'm gone
I'm leaving leaving baby

I'll never forget what you did to me

I'll never forget what you did to me"

"event","basket ball game tonight. not a real one, just a red and white one (as in its CBU agains CBU). Fun, of course i wore the infamous Kelli shirt. i am her fucking #1 fan. 

sometimes i just hate going to games cause everyone is sitting with their bffs or girlfriend/boyfriend and it makes me sad. i remember how i was my freshman year and what my goals were for myself in college and i feel like a dissappointment. i dont' want to be sad in this journal but i am kinda. i want janine to be around. i miss having a close group of friends. 

i miss the old basket ball games. its not the same anymore, i'm fucking hated. guys can't sit near me or talk to me really cause none of them want to be seen talking to me and the girls just plain don't like me either. 

i wish i could fucking leave this school and this city. i only have to be here for 1.5 more years, thank god.

OMG i saw this guy i met in the bar on friday night here on campus just 10 minutes ago. Fucking insane. i looked at him...said hey...and as he was passing he says 'bet you dont' remember me' and i said 'from friday night'. HAHAHA damn, wonder if he knew me at the club. Damn that would be fucked up if he did. eeeerrrrr i HATE guys such fucking losers. Be real, i mean is that so hard. don't play with girls and don't deceive them. if you can't get a girl to like you by being honest and real with them you need to keep yo ass at home.

"event","ok lets see. i do have good things to tell but for me its bad to talk about the good things that are going on because right when you say something all hell breaks loose. when i have something good i dont' like to talk about it because if fear of losing it so it's really hard for me to be all happy go lucky with what i say.

i like to talk about things like movies and books because no matter what i say or do they wont' ever change. There in lies all my happiness, maybe it's not the look into me that people wish i would show but too bad it is what i'm willing to let out.

i think that is what is really what makes me different. i don't like to show how i really feel, good or bad, about something. i've gotten so good at hiding my feelings people around me rarely see what i'm really going through. i dont' know if its a good thing or a bad thing, all i know is its  me. 

Although, i do believe that some of what i write is more personal than what others right yet they criticize me that it's not good enough i should try a little harder. i'm not gonna write everything i did today or yesterday. I'm gonna write my feelings and what is going though my head rather than what my body is doing as i move through this world. 

but if that is what people want to see well then ... i woke up, wrote some of my accounting paper, watched tv, helped my dad (oh how he loves me, i love the father/daughter relationship, it is so special), then ate some food and went to buy kelli a bday present (she's gonna like it to...even if i have to force her to!) and now i'm doing this instead of finishing my paper. The most important thing for me to do and think about right now is this damn paper. but my real motivation for doing it is so i can go out on a date on sunday when i get back to memphis. (this is what i refuse to talk about)

i can't wait to get back to memphis. i need to get a job cause i'm so poor right now!!

"event","so i'm not making progress on this stupid paper. i'm such a procrastinator!!! but i'll get it done and life will go on. 

so i am ok right now. everything is relatively good. if i dont think about shit too much its all good in leahtown.  

my knees, well all my joints but it starts with my knees, hurt when it gets late and i get tired. it awful but i can't do shit about it.  

i love movies. the way they take you away from your real life. for two hours you can escape to a world totally different from yours. you can get lost in emotions that make you feel like you could fly. its an amazing thing what movies do to people. it moves us and drives us. people will alter their whole lives jsut because of a movie they saw. this is the most amazing thing in the world to me. i wanted to be a film director for so long. i wanted to make people feel what i created for them on the screne. but i learned that that wasnt' something i could really do so i gave up that dream but i will never give up my love for movies. Movies can reach inside you and squeeze your heart until you cry and love and hate. sometimes it opens your eyes to something you never knew about, it makes you see from a perspective that you would not have had the chance to otherwise. 

books do the same thing but it is more personal. the visual is individual to each reader. it is deeper and you are closer to the story and the characters because if the author is good they make you feel like you are there. you can smell and taste and feel and see everything as if it were happening to you or you were actually there. you become close to a character where you get angry if they fuck up and cheer for them if they do good. the most amazing thing is how the characters that are most vivid to the readers really do live in the authors mind. for the authors they are real. its not fake or made up, their characters live and exist in their imagination. its like they writer is merely opening a door for us to walk into and explore their mind, which could be a world of fantasy or reality or the past or an alternate universe. it can be anything but never fake because it is real to the author. and it becomes real to the reader. ummm how i miss my reading time.

maybe if i get this paper done i'll have some time to read!!! uuuhhhhhhmmmmmmmm"

"event","i know what i should do but i don't know if i'd be happy doing it. i think i should stick to the more lucrative accounting yet i don't think i want to continue on a course that leads me to doing accounting all my days. if i decide to go into something else with my accounting degree i would feel that i wasted alot of my time learning something that i know i don't want to use. i don't even think i know what is interesting to me anymore. accounting, finance...nothing. i really just want to move on to the next stage in life. i'm getting tired of learning and having little control and money always going out of pocket. i'm ready to have complete control and earning money and doing things. but i know that in order to have the best the future can offer me i have to get through this shit. it's so hard to say motivated these days. i used to enjoy learning and knowing things, but now .. i just dont know. 

our lives are so short in the span of all of time. we live for merely a moment. nothing i can do will be memorable in the future so why not live the most ordinary life possible. why strive for great things when most likely you are not the only one doing it and all together you are all just ordinary becuase normal and ordinary and therefore extraordinary are all relative. if we all strive then none will surpass while if we all just do what we can eventually the one who really wants it will stand out for striving for it. we can't all be the best. i don't even want that any more so what am i doing. i could go into finance and be an average finance major with my great work ethic and get a fine job and enjoy the little things in life that those people trying to reach the top don't have time for. 

who knows. i guess i jsut need to figure out what i really want out of life and do the things that will get it for me. (but i still don't want to disappoint anyone)"

"event","why do guys think because you've been hurt by someone in a certian way they can hurt you like the ones before them have. does it not matter anymore to people how others feel. i'm so hurt. so tired of being abused because other people aren't even considering how it is making me feel. 

the biggest fear i have is of letting go and giving in to my feelings and finding that i get left again. i'm afraid of what will happen once i finally open up to someone. D never tried to understand me or get to know me. i knew him, or thought i did. hell i thought i loved him but in retrospect i now know i was not in love with him i just loved him, as a person. i never told him how i really felt and what i really wanted from him. i just assumed what he felt and just reacted to how he treated me. that ended very badly. i hurt myself over the entire situation. 

before him i was told i was ugly, fat and basically no good by many, even those who didn't know me. Made me think the way they saw me was how i really was. that's why i have such a low self-esteem. that's why i let people run me over, because i've been told i wasn't worth more. Then the way i was actually treated and allowed people to treat me made it all true. i never really understood this, i just let it go. if i had known this i would never have let any of the things that happened happen in the beginning. 

The next painful experience was E. He wasn't anything, he was interested in me, but i was not going to go after him. didn't think much of it. then he really went after me. so i gave him a chance, i got to know him. we made the mistake of having sex too soon. and of course it was all my fault, not his at all. i mean he's a guy and that's what they want, right? i should know that and not give it up so easily. but can he not take any blame for pushing me so hard. i liked him, wanted him. thought we were opening up to eachother. i finally thought i had met someone who would want to be with me. who would know all my faults and like me anyway. someone who would have respect for me. but damnit it was all in my head again. he found my reputation (which is made totally of my mistakes that i wish i could change but must live with) too much, he decided i deserved no respect and he treated me terribly. he decieved me and told me he really liked me and was ready to be really serious about our relationship. he fucking talked to me every day and was jealous when i even talked bout another friend. he would call and leave me messages saying how he missed me. is it so easy for guys to lie and decieve someone like this. later it got worse and i stopped talking to him, then i come back to memphis and he wants to see me again and he comes and i can feel the connection again, and it kills me. i think its real and i want it to be. i'm willing to forgive if he's willing to be real. but this time i can tell when soemthing's up. he gets pissed at me for a reason he has no right to. if can feel that the reason is bullshit, its just an excuse for him to leave again. this time i can't handle it and i fight him, i mean fist-to-jaw. i go crazy. you know why this is totally fucked up, besides the actual physical abuse(and i'm very sorry about that). i am totally not violent. i don't like to fight verbally and most definaltely not physically. but he brought me to the point where i would have beat the shit out of him had i had the strength. he could have hit me that night and i would not have cared.  later we talk again about it and he says of course he was never serious about me. he knew my reputation and he wanted to keep the 'tradition' going. he wanted to be another name on the list of men who have taken advantage of me. who have decieved me. what kind of person wants that. i told him how i regretted the shit i had done, how i wanted to change. he lied to be so he could do me the same as all the others. does it really make me the idiot, i just wanted to be with someone i liked and to finally be open, to not hold back. and again a little after telling me this he tells my best friend that he really did like me he just felt like it was moving too fast and he needed me to leave him alone. yet he was alwasy the one saying he was my boyfriend, i always said no it's too soon and we werent' really like that yet. instead of telling me this he pushed it more and more. so whats' the truth? the truth is it doesn't matter anymore becuase the damage has been done. from the moment on my birthday weekend, from the moment he said he never cared at all i knew i was totally different. i knew i would never trust again. i knew every man i meet will be the same.....

they all want sex, they want pleasure over all else. they want their own comfort over all else even if it's an entire person. now i'm faced with someone who wants me to open up to him and all i can think about is all the evil things he will do to me. all the evil things they have all done to me and how i'm the one to blame because i'm a stupid girl who let it happen. i can't blame any of them it's all my fault. i can only look in the mirror to find fault. but it doesn't change that i'm so scared. i'm so scared it physically hurts. 

i don't know what to do anymore. i'm scared and alone and am totally lost.

YOu will find that one of them is wrong."" and i agree to a point but sometimes i truely feel that the contradiction is true. sometimes the actions are not wrong its how you go about doing them. so maybe i'm not bad for doing what i do, i'm bad for doing the things i do like i do. so am i good or bad? did i mean to do wrong? did i mean to fuck things up? am i a bad person for being so stupid as to make the same mistakes too many times? is it bad or jsut plain stupid? i know what i should do and what i want to do but sometimes i feel like if i pick one or the other i am getting cheated out of something. 

i know what i have to do to make my life better, to stop being miserable. but doing it is not easy, which is how i know it's what i need to do. i mean, who came up with the rediculous idea that the right/good/honorable thing to do is the harder one. why must it be that way. why can't the good thing to do abe the easy thing. why must we struggle and deal with so much pain. should being human already count for something. ""its not supposed to feel this way, its not supposed to hurt this way"" 

I want to be successful. i want to be happy. i want respect. i want to feel like have accomplished great things. i want to feel like i impacted someone's life in a positive way. i want to have fun. i want to be challenged. i want so many things but the truth is that all the things i truely want are the things one must work their ass off for, you have to struggle for these things, and fight for them. sometimes i feel so weak like i jsut want to give up. the time i'm alive is so short in the long run anyway what difference can i really make? i should just go out and enjoy myself for now, right? do we alwyas have to look toward the future, can we not have joys right now without the terrible consequences?


ok i'm tired for now but i will return damnit!!"

"event","i think i'm finally at my breaking point. nothin is going right, i keep making mistakes or not being satisfied with my decisions. i'm not necessiarily making the wrong decisions anymore i jsut haven't made a right one in so long.  i just want to get this shit over with, school and memphis and immature boys. i'm done, no fucking more. 

i don't think i'm depressed. i think i'm just worn down. finally i jsut want to get through. 'gotta get through this'

I will turn to Kahlil Gibran. his writings always mean something to me, they always fit my emotions and philosophical spirit. it is long so if you don't want to read it don't. but it is definately wise! 

I will be happy again. no need to worry bout me..i will always survive and continue on and people will always see me as strong no matter how i really feel...

We and You:

We are the sons of Sorrow, and you are the 
Sons of Joy. We are the sons of Sorrow, 
And Sorrow is the shadow of a God who
Lives not in the domain of evil hearts.

We are sorrowful spirits, and Sorrow is 
Too great to exist in small hearts.
When you laugh, we cry and lament; and he
Who is seared and cleansd once with his 
Own tears will remain pure forevermore.

You understand us not, but we offer our 
Sympathy to you. You are racing with the
Current of the River of Life, and you
Do not look upon us; but we are sitting by 
The coast, watching you and hearing your
Strange voices.

You do not comprehend our cry, for the
Clamour of the days is crowding your ears,
Blocked with the hard sustance of your 
Years of indifference to truth; but we hear
Your songs, for the whispering night 
Has opened our inner hearts. We see you
Standing under the pointing finger of light,
But you cannot see us, for we are tarrying 
In the enlightening darkness.

We are the sons of Sorrow; we are the poets
And the prophets and hte musicians. We weave
Raiment for the goddess from the threads of 
Our hearts, and we fill tehe hands of the 
Angels with the seeds of our inner selves.

You are the sons of the pursuit of earthly
Gaiety. You place your hearts in the hands
Of Emptiness, for the hand's touch to 
Emptiness is smooth and inviting.

You reside in the house of Ignorance, for
In his house there is no mirror in which to 
View your souls.

We sigh, and from our sighs arise the 
Whispering of flowers and the rustling of 
Leaves and the murmur of rivulets.

When you ridicule us your taunts mingle
With the crushing of the skulls and the
Rattling of shackles and the wailing of the 
Abyss. When we cry, our tears fall into the 
Heart of Life, as dew drops fall from the
Eyes of Night into the heart of Dawn; and
When you laugh, your mocking laughter pours
Down like viper's venom into a wound.

We cry, and sympathize with the miserable
Wanderer and distressed widow; but you rejoice
And smile at the sight of rsplendent gold

We cry, for we listen to the moaning of the 
Poor and the grieving of the oppressed weak;
But you laugh, for you hear naught but the
Happy sounds of the wine goblets.

We cry, for our spirits are at the moment
Separated from God; but you laugh, for your
Bodies cling with unconcern to the earth.

We are the sons of Sorrow, and you are the
Sons of Joy....Let us measure the outcome of
Our sorrow against the deeds of you joy
Before the face of the Sun...

You have built the Pyramids upon the hearts
Of slaves, but the Pyramids stand now upon
The sand, commemorating the Ages our 
Immortality and you evanescence.

You have built Babylon upon the bones of the
Weak, and erected the palaces of Nineveh upon
The graves of the miserable. Babylon in now but
The footprint of the camel upon the moving sand
To the nations who bless us and curse you.

We have carved Istar from solid marble,
And made it to quiver in its solidity and 
Speak through its muteness.

We have composed and played the soothing
Song of Nahawand upon the strings, and caused
The Beloved's spirit to come hovering in the 
Firmament near to us; we have praised the 
Supreme Being with words and deeds; the words
Became as the words of God, and the deeds
Became overwhelming love of the angels.

You are following Amusement, whose sharp claws
Have torn thousands of martrs in the arenas
Of Rome and Antioch....But we are following
Silence, whose careful fingers have woven the
Iliad and the Book of Job and the Lamentations
Of Jeremiah.

You lie down with Lust, whose tempest has 
Swept one thousand processions of the soul of 
Woman away and into the oit of shame and 
Horror....But we embrace Solitude, in whose
Shadow the beauties of Hamlet and Dante arose.

You curry for the favor of Greed, and the sharp
Swords of Greed have shed one thousand rivers
Of blood....But we seek company with Truth,
And the hands of Truth have brought down 
Knowledg form the Great Heart of the Circle
Of Light.

We are the sons of Sorrow, and you are the
Sons of Joy; and between our sorrow and your
Joy there is a rough and narrow path which
Your spirited horses cannot travel, and upon
Which your magnificent carriages cannot pass.

We pity your smallness as you hate our
Greatness; and between our pity and your
Hatred, Time halts bewildered. We come to 
You as friends, but you attack us as enemies;
There is a deep ravine flowing with tears
And blood.

We build palaces for you, and you dig graves 
For us; and between the beauty of the palace
And the obscurity of the grave, Humanity 
Walks as a sentry with iron weapons.

We spread your path with roses, and you cover 
Our beds with thorns; and between the roses
And the thorns, Truth slumbers fitfully.

Since the bginning of the world you have
Fought agains our gentle power with your
Coarse weeakness; and whn you triumph over
Us for an hour, you croak and clamour merrily
Like the frogs of the water. And when we 
Conquer you and subdue you for an Age, we 
Remain as silent giants.

You crucified Jesus an dstood below Him,
Blaspheming an dmicking at Him; but at last
He came down and overcame the generations, 
And walked among you as a hero, filling the
Universe with His glory and His beauty.

You poisoned Socrates and stoned Paul and
Destroyed Ali Talib and assissinated
Madhat Pasha, and yet those immortals are
With us forever before the face of Eternity.

But you live in the memory of man like
Corpses upon the face of the earth; and you
Cannot find a friend who will bury you in
The obscurity of non-existence and oblivion, 
Which you sought on earth.

We are the sons of Sorrow, and sorrow is a
Rich cloud, showering the multitudes with 
Knowledge and Truth. You are the sons of 
Joy, and as high as your joy may reach,
By the Law of God it must be destroyed 
Into nothingness, for it is naught but a 
Thin and wavering pillar of smoke."

"event","about 5 hours ago my great-grandmother passed away. my dad called when i was on the way to a friend's house. he said, ' leah Grandmother passed away tonight' and what i felt was the most awful pain in my chest and my eyes fill with tears. i can't speak, i can't think. my vision gets blury and all i can remember is how much i love her. she was always so nice, we had to talk so loud for her to hear us and she couldn't see anything. i was always so shy even around her. but she knew, we had a connection and i loved her/ love her i will always love her. i remember she is the first person to ever get me to eat lamma(sp?) beans. i always hated beans of any kind and she said i would like these. so she went to the little kitchen and started to make a pot of them, and it was like 2 in the afternoon. But i ate them and i liked them and every time i eat them i think of her. she had trouble walking, like most really old people do, and there are 3 steps from the living room door to the garage. i was about 10 maybe and we were visiting and every time we had to all go somewhere i stood on the steps and held her hand as she came down them. i remember how soft and warm her hand was, and she smiled so big, she was so happy someone wanted to help her. many years later she still would recall me as a little girl helping her up and down 3 little stairs. i remeber how i cried when she fell in the house and hit her head on the piano and had to have surgery. i was so worried that she wouldn't recover. but she did, she is ...was a damn strong woman. she was so cute with her hair all buzzed off from the surgery. she couldn't go get it permed like old ladies do so it was strait for a while and i jsut loved it. she pinned it back with little bobby pins and it was so soft and she looked so beautiful to me. 
i love her and i will miss her. Dovey Killingsworth."

we dont' need no more trouble
what we need is love

Avril:

doesn't really matter how i feel inside cause life is like a game inside,
then you came around me the walls jsut disappeared
i'm unprotected
i've never felt like this before 
i'm naked around you 
does it show
you see right through me
i can't hide 
i'm naked around you and it feels so right
 
mos def:

what it is what it is what it is what it is

feed me fuck me love me touch me
this whole world is cold and ugly
what we are is low and lovely

close your eyes and i'll be right there
wide open
all over ....again

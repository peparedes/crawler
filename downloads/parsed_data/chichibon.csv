I have gone to 3 colleges/universities in Cali...
I'm in love with UC Berkley!! It's way better 
than VCU..
Damn, i should have went there..but then,
I could have never met my LOVE, my great Friends 
that I have NOW and a job!
My family out here has told me that I can 
live with them if i go to school out here
in Cali..I'm really considering it..But 
I want my BF to be with me...
We'll see...Perhaps one day!

Well, Friday night was a blast with my coworkers and friends.  We went to Banditos and damn was it a Yuppie bar.  It was fun b/c i went with a bunch of kickass peeps.  Afterwards, we went to Bottom's Billards to meet up with Phil.  He was recovering from his buzz and game.  They stopped serving food there, so we went to 3rd st diner.  Phil came along too. For some reason, Phil was being really affectionate to me in front of his uncle and my friends.  He's usually not like this b/c he dreads PDA (Watevs!!!)  Neways, I really liked it and i missed all the mushy stuff.  

Wellz, i had to take my manager and my friend, nina home so me and lei got home around 530am.  Remember i had to work at 8am.  I only had 45min of sleep.  After work, i went home to VA BCH.  I met up with Roger at Barnes and Nobles and told him that i don't want to be with anyone either and that we would remain friends..I just told him that It's just bad timing right now.  He told me, things would be different if we lived closer to one another.  I'm like watevs...moving on.  I also told him that i'm not gonna call him all the time cuz he get's boring after a while.  
So i finally make it to my mom's house and damn, she remodeled the downstairs.  It actually looks good b/c we have hardwood floors now.  I really missed my mom and i missed my doggies!!!

Ohhh LJ, check this out.............
I sleep with my mom when i go home to see her and do you guys remember mentioning that i cuddled with lei...Well, i caught myself almost cuddling with my mom.  Subconciously, i'm thinking of someone, most likely it's Phil and then later on...subconciously, i'm kissing phil in my dreams, but it's actually my dog kissing me...YUCK!!!  hehe

You know what??? I don't have Urban studies tonite, it got cancelled!! Yes
Does anyone want to do something tonite??  Hmmm, maybe not, i have to study"

"event","I am Scorpio, My Lover is Leo

This is one of the oddest combinations in the zodiac, yet I see it working all the time. Definitely have a go at this relationship but be prepared to put in a lot of elbow grease. You are a water sign and Leo is fire, a terrible mix if there ever was one, yet I have seen it work in many cases. My grandmother and grandfather were this mix. Oh, you can imagine the drama, the intensity, the loud arguments, and the slammed doors! But there were hours of hearty laughter, warm and cozy family Christmases, walks together in the snow, reading alone and out loud to each other on the porch, a big family full of children, and many, many nights filled with music and good food. This Scorpio and Leo shared a rich life, and it was evident to all that they adored one another. 

As a Scorpio, you need intensity and will accept nothing less than grand opera for your life's script. You want to be loved all the way down to your toes -- deeply and completely. With a Leo you will get your wish. Leos have big hearts and approach everything with their arms wide open; they do nothing on a small scale. Scorpios like to be in control, but your Leo lover also likes to be the boss, so right off the bat you've got a power struggle. Both of you have VERY strong personalities, and both of you are fixed in your opinions. Be forewarned, this isn't going to be easy!

Yet if you try, this can be the love of your life and your Leo will fill your days with happiness and the intense drama and emotion you crave. This match is a yes!"

I went in my room to get something and it was even louder...My gosh, my neighbor upstairs was getting it on with someone.  How envious!  Lei was in the living room and WTF, she even heard her moans and screaming.  It must've been REALLY REALLY GOOD, but we noticed that it went for a SHORT TIME.  Damn, when i bang bang bang, it goes for hours and hours.  But THOSE were the days..At least someone was getting it on in our building..I'm jealous..

Ohhh One thing, i didn't even realize...It's really cold in my apt, so i sleep in the living room with lei on the futon.  Lei woke me up and she was like, EEEWWWW you were cuddling with me...GROSSED OUT, YUCK..i was in a deep sleep i guess and i guess i was dreaming of ORLando Bloom or my all-time Favorite cuddle buddy, Phil.

If u have been reading my journal entries, I have 2 guys that i usually tend to talk about a lot.  1 is Phil, who is here in RVA and 1 is Roger, who is at VA BCH.  I've been talking to Roger for a year and some change.  He was in the army and now he's back in VA BCH(he was stationed in KS and then he went to Iraq)..I liked him until he told me that he wanted to take things slow b/t him and I, i'm like damn..If u liked me, the same way i like U, i wouldn't have to hear that BS-lets take it slow SHIT! Ouch.. =o(
SO now, he's been wanting to visit me in RVA, saying that we are seeing each other..Honestly, i don't know what to feel right now about him.. And then there's Phil, damn...what am i suppose to do??  Should i keep both, 1 or the other, remain friends?? 

What i want to do is to really focus on school..my intentions are to limit these guys and soon drop them and hopefully remain as friends..My feelings are in the middle. I thought i knew who i would choose, but i'm uncertain..

"event","Yesterday was my first day back from school.
Tues looks like this:  Spanish 9-950
                    Survey of Asian History 11-1215
                    Intro to Urban Development 4-640
So my day runs smoothly, new faces in Spanish...
I have a couple of friends in History and all of 
a sudden I'm walking into my Urban Dev. class 
and the first thing i saw was a beanie cap with
 a red FOO FOO ball on top and i was like NO, 
it can't be...I had to do a second scope and it was PHIL..

*Note to LJ,  Phil was my TA in my Anthropology class, we (are/were????) seeing each other and now he's in another of my classes, but this time we are Classmates
*Another NOte, never date/see/hang out/do extracurricular activities/etc.. with your TA

I sat next to him and i can't concentrate, he's 
trying to avoid me, but he can't hehehehhehe..
LEt's just say, we both got distracted that
we weren't payin attention to our professor.
Of all the classes at VCU, he has to be in
my class, WTF??  I'm trying to stay or get
away from him, but Fate, damn fate wants
us in the same class..
I went home and told Lei my news, she also
told me that this weirdo guy that i don't 
vibe with is in her class..damn

Later on that evening, Lei, Courtney, and I
head out to the gym to get our workout on..
30min on the elliptical, I did bench presses 
and pull ups
* Motivational Goal is to look good b4 heading out to Cali/Las Vegas for SPring Break 2004!  Whoo WHoo, HOLLA
So, me and Lei smell something NOT SO 
FRESH cuz u know how we all sweat after
 a strenous workout..well it wasn't me, or lei
i dunno who it was, maybe it was the guys 
at the gym, but they STUNK, who knows*

Phil calls me and i ask him if he wants to 
drop by and he does (sometimes he tells me NO, he's too busy with school)
we talk outside, acting like a couple
in my head, are we?? are we not??
Honestly, it feels good around him 
and i like that.  
His roommate calls him up and asks 
him where he's at, HE replies, 
""I'm at my GIRLS house""
i'm shocked!!  like i said, 
Am I?? Am I not??
Here's the downfall of the night
with Phil..
blah blah blah, right..next thing u know
it..i accidentally call Phil, Frank (one of my good guy friends)
Ooooooops..I really had to explain to him 
who Frank is...hehe
kiss kiss, hug hug...In my head i'm laughin!!
G-nite and he leaves

I had to call Frank up and tell him
what i accidentally did, He was
laughing so hard...Damn!!

Today, i had just SPanish from 9-950
and now i'm on LJ.
Have a great day!!"

Saturday-Me and Nina night!!  We went back to Catch 22 at the Bottom...we were trying to be cool cuz we had VIP passes, shit, i didnt see it on the pass that u had to be at the club b4 12..daym we got there after 12..the bouncer was like, sorry ladies, gotta go to the end of the line..I was like ""Hellz NO"" the line was long as hellz.. Me and Nina went to Bottoms Billiards to get some drinks..I saw Phils uncle..He's pretty cool, playboy type, I can't believe i got to know him and Phil a little better.. Ohhh while me and Nina was drinking, an Old dude came by and started talkin to us...Lets just say, HE RUINED OUR BUZZ!!  I hate that feeling =o/

Sunday-Frank drove from the beach to RVA and had sushi with me, Lei, and courtney.  then we went back to the apt and then we went to Ipanema..afterwards we went to MOJO's and then we went home!

I should do something productive, like go

Weird thing to say, I'm happy that school
is starting tomorrow probably b/c i'm 
tired of staying on Idle.  I need info
in my brain and system..I really need 
to do better in school this semester, last
semester was my downfall, I've never had a D
on my transcript and if i want to get into
dentistry, i have to get rid of that D and get an A..
I'm sure i can pull through, when i first started 
i had a 3.5GPA and now it's like 2.7GPA..WTF??
I can do it again, just a lot of studying and 
concentration..NO distractions, NO Boys/Men..
However, i will though make new friends in 
each of my classes so i can obtain study buddies and 
maybe go out for some coffee in a couple of my 
favorite coffee shops in RVA..
This is sad, there isn't any food in our fridge, 
except apples that i bought last nite..Maybe 
later on, i'll make honey, citrus, lemon, chicken..sounds 
interesting..I'm just gonna put some shit together and
see what happens..Shoot, at least me and lei have
rice...If this turns out Great, i'll send u guys my
recipe.

"event","For the past hour, i've been reading entries and replying to them..I want to welcome my new friends on LJ...Thanks guys!! 1love

Friday nite:  I didn't have to go to work tonite. Yay!  My manager called me and said that i didn't have to come in since the store was blah!  I was down with that, so i played on LJ and watched How Stella got Her Groove Back.  Damn, that's a good movie, Mmmmm...taye diggs 
 *~*~Wishful thinking...One day, when me and Lei become successful professionals, I bet we are gonna pull a move like Stella and her gf..
Chi: Hey Lei, Lets go to Jamaica
Lei: Ok!
Chi: Isn't it my turn to pay for our whole shit?
Lei: Yep!
Chi: No doubt, I'm banking anyways!!
Lei: I'll See u there!!
Chi: Let's get a 20yr old while we are at Jamaica!!
Lei: Hellz Yeah!!
Chi: Werd!!
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha 

So, i went to my neighbors apt to finish watching the Stella movie and i played with his pus pussy, Connor.  He's a good pussy cat!!  Makes me want to get one, now.  My co-workers called me and asked me if i was still down to go out tonite, i was like Hellz Ya!!  IT was so funny how we made a party line with our cell phones, we were able to connect 6 peeps in 1. I've never done that b4..Sweet, Technology!! 
I left Lu's apt and went back to mine to get ready.  It was cold last nite, so i just wore a cute top and jeans.  I went back to Lu's apt to wait for my co-workers Angel and Nina to call me.  They finally arrived and i introduced Lu to Angel and Nina.  My co-workers are 2beautiful Nubian princesses.  I love these girls, they are so sweet!!  We were suppose to meet up with another co-worker, Tiffany, but she and her friends wanted to go to another club..Cool!  We ended up going to the Bottom where we went to Catch 22 (yucky 18 and up club)  Shit, we paid $5 for a crappy DJ with crappy music.  {I'm legal and old enuff to drink}

Here's wat happened inside the club:  We were all dancing with one another and all of a sudden, some nasty hispanic guy comes behind me and starts dancing with me, I'm grossed out cuz the dude was a midget!!  yes, a MIDGET!!  I was glad that he was shorter than me, but his face was on my butt!! heheheehee 
Sad thing, was that my friends didn't save me..hehehe..however, there was a security guard who witnessed my uneasiness and he pushed the midget away from my ass...Ok, so the midget is gone and me and girls go on the stage to get freak nasty...Next thing u know it, the music goes bad and we step off the stage..Once, we get off the stage another nasty hispanic guy with a pony tail starts dancing with my butt again..I'm like WTF AND THIS DUDE IS GETTING HARD, i'm Loud and Grossed out!!  The security guard see's this and pushes him off of me again...Damn, my friends didn't save me again..haha..It hits 2am and we leave...

WE HUNGRY, so we all went to 3rd street diner and we waited for an Hr for our food...Ohhh the cool thing is that we made friends with Shortee, he was the MC at Catch 22..he gave us free passes to go back next week...I was like WErd!! 

I met up with Phil at the diner, we were all tired so we left...me and Lu gave goodbye hugs to Nina and Angel.  Phil, took me and lu home...Lu leaves his car and me and phil chill!!

Dude, wassup with him...I've observed him from the 1st month until now and u know how it's always happy-happy HOneymoon stage and the 1st month is always awesome, and it hits the 2nd month and it's like damn, 30day trial is up and he wants his $$ back guarantee..( he neglected me =o/ ) Something gross and traumatic happened to me while i was with him (only a few know) and from that he's really into me again...Wassup>>>>???? 

Ohhh PS,  I'm fascinated by my fish and i also forgot to mention, eventhough lei already posted this on her LJ...My tongue got stuck on the spoon while i was eating UBE icecream early this morning when i got home..hehe"

I must say, What a weekend and a early week for me-
Friday:  Got home from work, Hung out with Shannon, met up with Lei and Zhana at Ipanema's, went to Bottom's Billards to meet up with Phil, played pool and drank until i got too too drunk.  I didn't mean to say the things i Yelled out my car to u, Phil (I love u, eh??)  I didn't mean to scare Shannon by doing sucking dick motions with my hands to a car filled with guys who wanted to do nasty things to us.  So, we headed home to my apt and saw that Lei and Zhana were pulling up to the garage.  I didn't mean to jump on a pickup truck and pretended it was a trampoline and i didn't mean to hump nice cars before entering our apt complex.  The poor bushes in the courtyard, I didn't mean to hide behind it and try telling my friends that they couldn't see me..hehe..My poor courtyard, i didn't mean to run around crazy and try to pee pee on U...My poor apt complex, I didn't mean to run inside the stairway and spit on your stairs while running to the second floor..hehe  Finally we all reached the apt..I was Ok and took a nap while Shannon read me a story and I puked!

Saturday:  Guess who calls me at 4am?  Phil!!  He was just checking up on me and wanted to know what happened to me during New Years.  We ended up talking till 7am.  I had to work @ 10 am till i dunno.  I went home and stayed there to sleep.

Sunday:  Roger came to Richmond to visit me.  I showed him around our Ghetto Fabulous city and i even showed him off at H&M to my co-workers.  Can i tell u that this man eats a lot.  I don't know if i could ever live with him b/c he eats too too much..Hehe, he's still Hot to me..Ohhh let me tell U, i'm all about cuddling, he didnt even cuddle with me...WTF, i was cuddling with him, isnt it suppose to be the other way around??

Monday:  Roger was still here..Poor thing, i took him with me to do my errands..It was a rainy day and i felt so tired so i napped with him on my futon.  I had to go home b/c i had to go to court the next day to pay for my stupid traffic violation.  Roger went home as well.. Check this out, I hung out with my mom at home, then i went to see my homegirl, Denise b/c she was leaving to go back to Japan the next day, afterwards, i went to see Roger at his house and we watched tv together and he played his keyboard for me, and finally, i went to see Frank.  Frank, is a guy version of me.  He seeks passion, but he can't find it.  He's seeing a couple of girls, and me i'm seeing a couple of guys..I love it that we can talk to one another about he/she.  Its great!!

Tuesday:  Woke up early to go to court, my gosh it was at 11am and u know wat? i didn't get out of there until 230pm..Man, i was the last person to be called upon.  My mom is so funny, i took her to court with me and SHE wouldn't stop talking..She was joking everyone, including the lawyers, my gosh.. Note to oneself, DON""T BRING MOM TO COURT!!  I payed my fee of $59 and rushed home to my mom's house b/c i had to pick up my laundry and go back to richmond to work.  I made it to work.  I hung out with Phil and watched a movie at my apt.  He however stayed a night with me and cuddled!!  He's the best cuddler by far.

Wednesday:  Remained lazy, had a full 12hr snooze with my cuddler..It was very nice..Hmmm, i need to do my laundry, get gas and by some food..that's wat i'll do..Until then!!"

"event","New Years!!!
I really thought i would spend New Years by myself here in Richmond..I was getting sad and depressed, but i really didn't think too much about it b/c i was cleaning up my room and apt..I called up Luke and we went out to Bogarts for New Years..It was great, i had my rum and coke, a free tequila shot, and champagne..

Roger called me to say Happy New Year and wished that i was there at the beach to give him a New Years KISS!  I told him that i'll give him one when I see him again.

Ohhh yeah, Luke was trying to take advantage of me, but i wouldn't let him.  I'm good like that!!  I only like him as a friend that i can hang out with, but nothing more b/c i don't want to ruin a friendship.

New Years Resolution:
*quit smoking
*get better grades in school
*fall in love
*pay off my bills
*lose 10lbs
*hook up my apt
*travel
*renew my passport
*eat healthy again
*read more, write more
*go to the gym more

there's more, but that's all i could think of right now.."

You definitely qualify as kinky - and not just occasionally.

You've exhausted every fantasy, but you're always open to new ones.  
<br>
Your sexual encounters are usually spiced with role-play, bondage, new positions, 
props, and fun fetishes.

"event","ok here goes. DOMO MERI-CHAN!!!! *KISSES CHEEK* hehehehe ok first off i had fun last weekend cuz i spent friday night at meri-chan's house and went insane literaly:P ya i missed her so much,it was greta to see her again. she was nice enough to let my ""vanilla"" come over and visit w/me. he had a lil fun, but he was mostly freaked out by how wild we were. then saturday i went to spend the night at jordana's house. it was ok. i would rather spend time w/her big sister instead though, cuz at least she wouldnt hit on me constantly. ya, she had the nerve to ask to take a shower with me. that totaly freaked me out. she knows i dont like that kind of thing but she chooses to ignore it her fault. then on sunday mark came over and we had some ""fun"" *wink wink* '.~ then we decorated the tree. i dont x-as all that much though. but anyways i think i shall go now.
suki-da risutokata ^.^ *kiss* miss ya 
your mana-neko"

+back into going to the gym every day
+living in southwest and to boot---coolidge with people i love in the fall
+getting drunk while wearing a toga tomorrow
+/- working all the time
+new car
+loving my family all summer
+reading good books
+my boyfriend always, and loving my true, real friends

things causing me stress:

- depressing weather
- where is all my money going?
- why does birth control put a solid ten lbs on you and it wont move..ever
- doing the same thing every week night
- being bored in lunenburg
- deciding where to live next summer
- why is transformers so sick i thought it sucked

i always have to organize my life which does not explain why i usually drive around in a car filled with my shit or i can never walk in my bedroom BUT...i always make post its and to do lists. and i felt that i needed to organize my thoughts of how my life is going, you know, on the surface at least"

"event","Whether it's through livejournal, talking, exercising, or what not...I gotta freeee my mind, whatever that means.  Problem in life right now: I am way more concerned about others happiness than my own. Example: I can't tell this girl at my school that I don't want to live with her next year because I do not want to hurt her feelings, but I really don't like her. I let people break my things, wear my clothes, drink my alcohol, etc, and I can never say no. Also if someone is not funny, I still laugh because I don't want them to feel stupid! People who never give me money for gas: I give them money EVERY time, because I can't not! Even though I really don't want to! Okay that's enough of that problem.
Next thing: I love hotdogs, I don't care about being skinny, I don't care if I'd rather wear sweatpants every single day than anything else, oh WELL! (So stop using facebook as a porno website all you gym rat girls) They would probably say ""you're just jealous""....well fuck yeah i am
Next thing: I am still currently very in love, very happy. BUT a girls gotta have girlfriends. I'm a firm believer, however I cannot stand girls so this proposes a problem. I believe Alyssa and Sabrina will be maids of honor. Since I transferred here this year, I think next year will be a little more girl filled.  I'm very happy about my decision to have come here and to live with my friend Sara (not the girl from top paragraph)and I think next yr will be fun :)

Okay that's about it for now, pce love and hotdogs"

"event","I go to college now. I sleep on the top bunk, sheets and comforter are pink and my room smells like cinnamon because that's the kind of air freshener we got. The first day I got here it felt like a bad summer camp. I looked out my window and saw kids unpacking and it was sweltering hot, and at that point I wanted to die, because what the fuck was I doing in Rhode Island when I had the best summer of my life in Lunenburg Mass just two days earlier? Anyway those days sucked. The first week of classes reminded me that I like learning, I just lack the ability to wake up any more than 10 minutes before my class and proceed to go in sweatpants when all the girls here dress like it's prom every day. The first weekend Eric visited, had so much fun together like always. Second weekend, I went to umass friday night (started crying when I stepped in a puddle with my uggs- thank you captians) and went to the taylor swift concert saturday night. Third weekend,do not remember thursday night, woke up with cut on knee. Sabrina stayed all weekend, made me miss home being with her. We watched old laguna beach episodes in my bed and went for walks and were hung over together. Fourth weekend (today) traveling to umass until Sunday. I have friends here, but it really sucks when you finally find someone who you get along with so well and then you have to leave. When knowing one person changes your outlook on life, hence the reason I'm not going nuts in college. I'm not sure what's going on with me, I'm starting to find more happiness in eating soup in wool socks in my dorm than going to frat parties where there are ice luges in the bathroom. When you find someone you love spending your time with, time seems wasted when they aren't there. (I love you)
Anyway back the reason why I'm writing in livejournal, I have no idea. My major is journalism, maybe that's why, I've been doing so much writing lately. Oh wait I know why, it's because I'm absolutely starving but it's pouring rain so the idea of me exiting my warm bed to walk to the dining hall is really unrealistic. I'm doing this to keep me busy so that I don't think about a honey wheat bagel with cream cheese and guava juice. fuck it, going to eat..see ya!

p.s, i run now. and i kinda like it"

"event","Who for gods sake would have thought I would be graduating high school on saturday. Somehow I still don't really feel much of anything. I mean lately, my life has been pretty much perfect. Summer is here, my friends are my world and I love them more than anything. I have a pretty close to perfect relationship with a boy which is new for me, and my family and I have been getting along. I've been beachin' it and going out and drinking my summer nights away with all the people I love, and everything seemed almost too good to be true, obviously. Now that I've fucked it up (as usual) and been caught in the midst of a bad lie with my parents, they hate me once again and I'm sentenced to (what seems like life) in prison/my home. Yes, goodbye beach week that I paid 200 dollars for, and goodbye car keys, and life, and friends. I had it all together, and now i've spent the last 3 days sleeping in the same spot on my bed full of clothes, and not eating unless it's sushi in small quantities. At least I cried today for real for the first time in fuckin forever, so at least i still gots a heart. bye."

"event","Tomorrow is my last day in lunenburg for a full 8 days. I'm so happy to pack up and get the fuck out, even if it's only for a week. A full week of breezy and sun and mexicans and spas and facials. Not school and not people or fights or family or any of that shitttty. Ah it will be so nice.
School isn't even that bad I guess, I just keep getting dismissed and coming in late because I think it's not a problem. I'm getting good grades though, so whateva.
I just re discovered livejournal which is also nice because I always read everyone else's things I just don't use my own any more. OH and today was a snowday. I real live snowday, and wanna know what i did? ABSOLUTLEY NOTHINGGGGG! And I loved it so much I just showered and slept the day away and it was great because every other day I have work and school and so much to do.
Oh yeah and it's valentines day.
That's also great.

"event","Well the weekend is over. I had a really nice day yesterday, and homecoming festivities were nice and fun and we should have won float but you know, not a problem. In spanish yesterday Jess Hare was like, ""UM, YEAH THE JUNIORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFIED ANYWAY SO YOU'RE LUCKY YOU GOT SECOND"". I was like wow stop talking. I hope she has a livejournal, it was mittens not stockings and had nothing to do with christmas. 
Now that homecoming has passed, it starts to get colder and things start to turn into winter which is really depressing and I'm not looking forward to it. I can't wait until they turn the heat on in school though, some time in November.
Today my job is to make Emily a mix cd for her car, because tomorrow's the big day for her! I hope she gets it first try cause it sucks when you fail.
Anyway I miss little Alyssa, and I had the worst time in Chem without her while she stayed home with her sore throat. On a really happy note, the real girls are going crazy friday night. And saturday night, I gotta take care of my costume soon!
Peace and love"

"event","List things you want to say but never think you could.......
1) list them
2) dont leave names beside them about who its about
3) dont ask questions

(I think I could say these things but I'd rather avoid the responses)

-I've loved you since I've known you, I would be lost without your guidance and humor and I have never met a friend like you before. We are insanely close.

-Sometimes you piss me off and make me want to punch you so you can look at yourself and realize you're not as amazing and cool as you think you are. Other times I am completely content to hang out with you. We shared a lot of things.

-You can be self centered and you over analyze most things, but it's okay because you're more like me than probably anyone I know. We usually have full understanding of eachother's minds, and I love you so much.

-You're one of the nicest people I've ever met. You are never brutally mean to anyone and you have been there for me through everything since we were 13. Sometimes you don't stand up for yourself though, but you give me a hug every day and that really means a lot to me(even though I know you do it to everyone).

-You are one of the hardest people to understand, but I could never imagine my life without you in it. You are hilarious, and you are beautiful and generous. You can be selfish and definatley immature. You already know all of this, and I love you.


-Your happiness is most important to me. More so than your actual being, because you've made it that way. I think I use the word love but that's not true at all."

It's starting to become fall weather and that's real nice. Nice foliage and dry air and all of that. I love when it's octoberrr even though last october beats out any future october that comes my way. Friday went to emily's, then to work, then to the game, then out for a while then back to alyssas where we all slept. Woke up, chilllllleddd and then me and em and sabrina went to emily's house and ben left and alyssa had some stuff to do. We layed outside there, made some wonderful drinks and alyssa came over. Then me and sabrina went to work. Came back to emily's with ben, he helped us out a great deal. The rest of the night I dono, I fell asleep eventually. This morning I woke up at emily's, Justin came and got me and me him and critttt went out to breakfast and went to see his mimi in the hospital. I love her so much! Then I came home. Read my book and then went to pick some apples with my dad and sister. Niceeeee and now I'm back here just talking to myself about my weekend. Alyssa and Ben are in Boston today, I shouldaaaa gone. I need to make more $$. 
Possible job at abercrombie though, I just need to grow up a little bit in age.

it was nice to get away, even if it was rainy and even if we were accompanied by a ghetto fabulous 15 year old some of the time. It was nice to stay in a house just the three of us.
i'll update it with some pictures once i get them. we took an old time photo at old orchard and old men started snapping pictures behind the booth. it was creepy but i laughed.
i can't wait until we can all just live our own lives on our own in our own houses and make our own rules, or not make any more like. even though i'm sure on the day of graduation i'll be in tears, it still is exciting.
well everything is now back to the grind come tomorrow morning.

i love sleeping in. i love staying up late. 
every day was real girls and this whole school thing is going to be different. no more sleeping together every night and laying around every day and doing everything together. i loved that.
the amour this summerrr was beautiful no matter what
i fucking miss that and this is now some type of four year battle that i'll continue to go with every day. i miss driving around all the time and not caring/knowing what time of night it was. there was always these unexpected things happening and it was like i was never ready for anything but everything kept moving so fast. some nights it felt like i watched everything move around me and i was just sitting in my own little world thinking all these things about everyone that i was observing. sometimes i don't even remember moving around with all the people and some nights i remember perfectly and especially some mornings at 5 am. they remind me of salt all over my face and then a huge headache for the entire next 2 days.
you win some you lose some.
i miss the beach and suntanningggg and napping. gah i just miss the sun.

most likely this is boring to read, and i have so many pictures and not enough energy to post them. but anyway peace out summer i love you.
and hi school, i don't care about you.

goodddddbyeeeee everyone sleep good tonight"

"event","well.
honestly this summer blows. summer in general is nice, with warm weather and no homework or anything, and a lot of time to do whatever you want. the problem is just that everyone builds it up like it's the best time of their entire life, for some people it probably is; it used to feel like that for me but not so much anymore.
a few weeks ago it was always girls nights and we watched movies and ate too much food and we were always together every day just us 4. we even got sick of it and so we partied and were crazy for a few nights, and then what happened after that? i'd rather just have girls nights, where we sleep and are together. those seem far away and i don't know why. 
actually everything does. it's so weird when i stop and think about the fact that i'm 16 not 25 or not 10 and that i have things i need to do. i miss when i was little when i never even thought about anything. i just want to never have to think about why i feel a certain way, i always want to be happy and just go about my business.
i slept all day today, or just layed in bed reading and eating granola bars and drinking grapefruit juice. last night i watched some of sleepy hollow and went swimming with peter, i made some quesedillas. i made me one and him one, then my dad yelled at me so i didn't even feel hungry and he ate them both.
anyway i'm doing this right now just to pass the time because i don't know why i'm not with my best friends or something but i'm just not. 
my moods are like fucking tides lately i think i need medicine or something."

"event","Well i emailed my dad today.  It has been a while because I told my parents not to write because i was pissed at how my wife was treating me.  I was trying to be there for her when her dad died on christmas and everything was kosher.  She was asking how I was doing then when I told her I was living with another woman she flips on me.  She doesnt want to talk to me and hangs up if I try to see whats wrong with her.  I think god hates me for some reason.

Well Got more pills and snorted them.  Fuck my life is shit.  I have a date Sunday with someone named Brandy.  Hope that shit goes ok.  I had a zit on my lip and popped it.  Now is all red by my lip and is gonna scar.

"event","From the Mouths of Kids . . . 
These are cute .....

HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHOM TO MARRY?
( 1 ) You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming. -- Alan, age 10

( 2 ) No person really decides before they grow up who they're going to marry. God decides it all, way before, and you get to find out later who you're stuck with. -- Kirsten, age 10

WHAT IS THE RIGHT AGE TO GET MARRIED?
( 1 ) Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person FOREVER by then. -- Camille, age 10

( 2 ) No age is good to get married at. You got to be a fool to get married. -- Freddie, age 6 (very wise for his age.)

HOW CAN A STRANGER TELL IF TWO PEOPLE ARE MARRIED?
( 1 ) You might have to guess, based on whether they seem to be yelling at the same kids. -- Derrick, age 8

WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM AND DAD HAVE IN COMMON?
( 1 ) Both don't want any more kids. -- Lori, age 8

WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE
( 1 ) Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know each other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long enough. Lynnette, age 8 (isn't she a treasure?)

( 2 ) On the first date, they just tell each other lies and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. -- Martin, age 10 (wise beyond his years.)

WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON A FIRST DATE THAT WAS TURNING SOUR?
( 1 ) I'd run home and play dead. The next day I would call all the newspapers and make sure they wrote about me in all the dead columns -- Craig, age 9

WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?
( 1 ) When they're rich. -- Pam, age 7

( 2 ) The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't want to mess with that. -- Curt, age 7

( 3 ) The rule goes like this: If you kiss someone, then you should marry them and have kids with them. It's the right thing to do. -- Howard,age 8 (this one has very good morals.)

IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?
( 1 ) It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after them. -- Mike, age 4 (bless you child.)

HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT IF PEOPLE DIDN'T GET MARRIED?
( 1 ) There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn't there? --Kelvin, age 8

And the #1 Favorite is........
HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK?
( 1 ) Tell your wife that she looks pretty, even if she looks 
like a truck.-- Ricky, age 10"

"event","Ok here is some other funny shit that happened to my friend.  My friend G always used my computer to find girls and shit and started typing to this girl.  They would talk for a few days and she wanted to meet up with him.  G said for me and my friend Heiny to come in case she was ugly and shit.  Well me being me I brought my video camera along.  She said for G to meet her at burger king where she worked.  Hehe that is just funny in it self.  So we go to burger king and G starts looking for a light skinned girl, bout 5-5, brown hair and we spot one.  Man this girl was fuckin hideous.  She had warts and shit on her face and she was like 200 lbs.  She had a picture of G so she came right up to him and greeted us.  We said hello kinda lauging in our heads and she said for us to wait at one of the tables.  As we were waiting we could see her all happy talkin to her friends and braggin cause shes got a good lookin man.  We were sittin at the table and laughin tell G that we were going to leave him there with the girl by himself and he said you better fuckin not dude.  I came up with the idea to tell her that you will give her a ride home after work......and then right when shes about to get in peel out on her.  He said he'd do it.  I hurried to Heiny's car to get the cam and he and I waited behind a dumpster.  It was cold as shit out and it was taking forever.  G pulled up to the door and waited......car idleing and everything.  She finally came out and said her good byes to her friends and headed for the car.....I couldnt keep the camera still a was laughing my ass off to hard.  Right when she was getting ready to grab the car door he peeled out and it was loud as shit.  She looked so bumbed and turned away back towards her friends.  Omfg it was the funniest shit ever.....well thats what the girl gets for lying saying she looked good and shit.  Alright i'm done.  Another story sutra!"

"event","So I was sitting in my barracks room one day when I was still in the Army and had an idea.  I took a shit and grabbed a plastic fork and scooped the shit out and smeared it on a one dollar bill.  It was so rank I almost threw up.  I had gloves on by the way.  I carried the dollar carefully downstairs along with my camera.  I placed the dollar on the sidewalk so the dollar looked clean....you know the shit was on the bottom and clean side face up.  I put it down and sat about 30 feet on some picnic bench and waited patiently.  Some guy was walking by so I started recording.  He was walking all happily and noticed the dollar.  He looked around and all non chalantly picked it up and put it in his pocket.  Well the dollar bill was already in his pocket and had already pulled his hand out when he noticed shit stains all up on him.  I couldnt stop laughing and couldnt hold the camera steady it was so funny.  He was yellin out, ""shit....fuck!!!...damn.""  Instead of throwing it on the ground right away he pulled it out gingerly and walked it over to the trash can.  Well after he left I got it out and repeated it like 2 times and everytime people got pissed and I got a laugh...."

We are just the few who are 30 and under....well davids 30 today and im 25 but yeah.  Im glad his parents came to see him and gave him a few items of clothes smokes and his mother made some good cup cakes that i got to try.  Im really happy for him but its just another sad reminder that I dont have anyone to come see me.  Im listening to BOB Marley now and its a song called is it love or something like that and I makes me cry because I once had love but I screwed it up by getting addicted to my medication my doctor put me on.  Its like ive always hurt inside and the meds the doctor put me on only covered up my hurt and didnt fix it when i got off the meds.  It always makes me cry that people get visitors and im stuck here to watch them be happy....its really fucking with my head.  I went to an NA meeting yesterday and instead of listening to the speaker I was focused on this gorgeous girl sitting in front of me.  She would look at me and smile and I could tell she wanted me to talk to her but I was too chicken to do it.  Im really shy about going up to people I dont know and talking to them.  I was rejected by my mom and fear rejection.  Ive always had girls come up to me and talk to me but not the other way around.  Well I left the meeting early and sat outside in the common area and the girl walked by me and my friend david said man shes checkin you out dude and I saw her look at me again but I let her keep walking away....Damn I should have said something because I need some affection badly.  It doesnt even need to be sex just someone to hold and kiss.  Another reason I didnt say anything is because technically Im still married.  I havent heard from my wife in a long time so I guess it shouldnt matter but for some reason It mattered a little.  God I hate this shit.  Why cant I just learn like everyone else and do whats right.  I figured 5 years in the army and going to combat would be good for me but it only made things worse for me.  Now Im stuck in some place 1200 miles away from my dad.  It was his birthday yesterday but when he called I made sure and not answered because I didnt want him to be reminded of how a son like his was a fuck up on his birthday.  As im writing this someone tapped me and said my father called AGAIN.  I dont know what to do.  I really dont have anything to say.  Im just here working the program and feeling sad everyday I wake up.  God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change...the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference."

Well since ive been back ive had the pleasure in rolling a few times, got really drunk and done numerous other things i shouldnt have.  And you know what i dont feel any better for it.  My new years resolution is to stop drinking, smoking, taking drugs, more meditation, more excercising and basically anything that can help me attain nirvana.  Ive been eating out everyday and i need to stop.  The food in afghanistan was so horrible and to eat like normal food is da bomb and i dunno if i want to stop.

Most of my friends are gone in other countries so basically i just sit here in my room all day and read, sleep, computer, and order pizzas and watch tv.  God maybe afghanistan wasnt so bad after all.  So yeah lets see if i can try to keep all these goals i have....my biggest one is to stop smoking though. well anyways yeah happy new years everyone."

At least the asshole didnt rub it in to much and brought me back taco bell two time zomes away......even though it had tomatoes in it and i hate tomatoes.  I guess its the thought that counts.

He used to work and help support my aunt and there kids but he decided to quit.  He said spirits came into his dreams and told him to stay home.  My father and Step mother would always clown his ass and just be astonished at some of the things he would do.  He then decided that he would change the way he dresses.  He started dressing in Indian type gear with feathers and shit.  When ever relatives would come by and we had a reunion type thingy my aunt would always be emmbarrassed.  I would be too.  But the funniest thing ever that Ive heard is.....wait I got to stop lauging......ok....we had this easter family get together and everything was fine.  Jeff was doing his oddball thing and everyone else was eating.  The guy jeff comes up with like some navaho shit gear on and has an extra plate of food.  He walks away and goes out side.  We all watch where hes going and jeff stops at a tree.  He sets the food down and blesses the tree from what it looked like.  Jeff walked back in and we asked what he did.  He said he was giving food to the indian spirits.  I could tell my dad was laughing his ass off in his head.  Jeff explained that he leaves food out there and the spirits eat it.  Later when he left my dad was like what the fuck is wrong with that guy.  Of course the foods gone.....the fucking squirrels ate the food!!!!!!!!!!!!!It probably doesnt sound funny to people who read this but if you could have seen my dad say it your would have laughed your ass off.  You know how some people can tell a joke and its funny as shit becuase of how they explain it.   well thats him.  anyway yeah what ever this guy jeff is crazy as shit.  I found out he hit my aunt and my dad went over there with a bat and straighted poor ol crazy jeff out.  You know a good old fashioned beating....the kind where you hit him more then he hits you....hehe"

"event","Well lets see.  Where should I start off.  My mother is a drug dependent white trash piece of shit.  I had to live with her for my first part of my life because my father was in prison for 5 years.  Its a long story but my mother put him there.  He educated him self there and got his accounting degree and later became a CPA.  When my dads life stabled after prison I went to live with him.  I love my father to pieces and he's always here for me now.  Ok that was just a fast backround check.

It was early in the morning and my mother took me and my little brother to the park one day.  I think I was about 8 at the time and my little brother was about 3.  We were happy little fuckers at the park.  My mother told me to watch my brother and that she would be back in a few minutes.  I said sure no problem.  We were in a dangerous part of the neighborhood in the south side of minneapolis at the time.  The place is run down and people doing drug deals all over but I was used to it so no problem.  

After about 4 hours of her not showing up I started to worry.  My little brother was crying because he was hungry and I was too.  I told him that mom will be here soon or so I thought.  About 3 hours more past and I said fuck it I need some food for my bro and I.  I carried him around with me and I begged people for some money so my bro and I could eat.  A lot of people told us to fuck off.  They were trash themselves and werent going to give what little money they had to us.  I finially asked some old lady and she gave me like $5.00.  I thanked her a thousand times over and over again.  I walked to the store with my brother in my arms and we bought chips, soda, and a candy bar.  This at least shut my brother up for a little while.  I couldt deal with the crying anymore.

We went back to the park and waited.  A police officer asked us if we were ok and I told him yeah were fine.  I told him that we lived down the street and we were just playing.  I lied of course because I didnt want to start drama and get my mom in more trouble then she needs.

About 6 hours later my mom shows up.  It was about 12 at night and I was so glad to see her.  We had been at that park for about 14 hours.  I could tell my mother was high on something cause she was acting funny as shit.  I bitched her out but I could tell it went in one ear and out the other.  

We got in the car and we were driving down the street.  We stopped at some house that I had never seen before and I asked why we stopped here.  She said she needed to run in real quick and to stay in the car.  I asked if we could come in but she said no.  Well what ever then I said.  Her ass was in that fucking house for like 3 hours.  What a fucking bitch she is.

Anyway that was a memorible day I had growing up.  I could write a fucking book with all the fun stories I have.  But thats another time.  Well anyway yeah I havent seen my mom now for like 7 years.  I have talked to her a few years ago but she just wanted to know if I had some money she could barrow.  She didnt even ask how I was and she had the audasity to ask for money.  Yeah I heard she and my sister are dying.  Apparently my sis got some shit from my mom.  Im surprised she isnt dead yet with all the drugs she has done.  Oh and another fun thing too my dads dying too from Hep C.  I guess he needs a new kidney like real soon.  Its funny how life works out for some people.  After a few years I wont have anyone left.  I dont know what Ill do then.  I probably go to church more and be with God more then I am now.  Well peace out who ever reads this shit."

"event","I asked my friend if he had any good movies and he lent me a movie called Crap.  It's basically the guys on Jackass that made a movie.  In one of the parts there were these three guys that sat down and drank 100 shots of beer.  One shot every minute.  After like the 40th shot they were puking and sick to there stomack.  Well me being crazy and all i decided I would try it.  I asked my friend Guajardo if he wanted to try and he was like I dont know man.  I begged him and told him I'd supply the beer and he finially gave in.  I went to the store and bought a 24 pack of Bud light.  We sat down at the picnic table and got out two shot glasses.  Well the shot glasses were tall ones and acted like two shots so we took 50 shots.  When we started there were like about 3 people watching.  They were sitting next to us telling us how we were gonna get sick and shit but we still went on.  By G's 15th double shot he started to puke.  I was laughing my ass off and telling him he was a pussy.  By about my 30th double shot.....60th shot i began my episode of puking.  It seemes like after every other shot we puked.  We had a pile of that nasty shit on both sides of us.  By about our 40th double shot we had like 20 people outside our barracks cheering us on and laughing at us.  We were already so fucked up and had like 20 shots more to go.  When we finially made it to our 100 shot we couldnt even stand up.  I tried to get up but fell immediatly to the ground.  We were both laughing our asses off as we were puking together.  Then out of nowhere this guy brings some vodka and tells us we have to take a double shot of it to finalize it.  I was like what ever and took the double shot of vodka.  Bad mistake.  I began puking and shit started to spin.  I just went back down on the grass and laid there for a minute.  People all around us were fucking with us and being ass holes.  I remember i was trying to break dance but looked dumb as shit.  We also got it all on tape so when ever i need a good laugh G and I watch the video.

That day was some crazy shit but you only live once and I love doing crazy shit."

"event","Who here loves the mall?  I love the mall.  I love it so much that I will skateboard 12 miles just to go to the mall.  I really don't go to the mall with any type of agenda.  I just go to go.  I especially love going around X-mas time.  Seeing everyone do their X-mas shopping and families having good times.  Good times I never got to experience.

Sometimes when I go to the mall I bring a pad and pen.  I find a seat with a lot of traffic around me and sit there.  I love to people watch.  I just sit there and mark things.  Things like how many white trash people I can find, different ethnic groups, or any thing just to amuse my self.  I look at people and just wonder what kind of life they have had so far.  I wonder if they have had a good life or a bad one.  I wonder what they are doing here at the mall themselves.  Are they just shopping?  Are they there to find a girlfriend/boyfriend?  Are they bored and just need something to occupy their mind?  I mean what is their purpose?  I'll admit I go to scope out the honies but I never act on it.  Sometimes I'll get smiles from someone but I'll just blush and look away.

I love to go into book stores and read magazines, eat at the fast food places, go to bath and body works and get that cucumber melon cream and incense----when ever I go in there I get these wierd looks from females.  I think they think that I'm gay or something but what evers clever.  I just love the smell of that shit.  I love looking at Cd's they might have.  Mostly downtempo, trip hop type or Incubus type alternative shit.  I love going in KB Toy store especially when I'm drunk and play with the little scooters or other shit I can get in trouble with.

Sometimes when I'm with my friends at the mall I'll do shit to get the peoples attention on us.  This really embarrasses my friends.  I'll pretend that I'm retarded and make noises andslobber all over my self.  One thing that I can do good is fall.  I used to think I was a stunt man and shit.  Ill be walking and do this fall and everyone around me will be like are you ok and ill just get up fast and look at them crazy.  It's some funny shit.  I remember when I was a kid at the mall I'd have this gadgit that you could put a dollar at the end and when someone tried to grab it you push this button and that dollar would retract.  Man such good times at the mall.  You all probably think im crazy but what ever.  I have fun at least.  Anyway yeah I love malls.......and taco bell.....hmmmmmmmm  Taco Bell."

We should have been back in Ft Bragg NC a week ago but we are not.  I hate this fucking place and want to go back to the states.  It doesn't look like we will go back to the states now for about a month.  The Uzbeks always beg and ask you for American shit and it gets old.  I miss little shit like Milk, Alcohol, fast food, normal water, a bathroom where i dont have to walk a half a mile to use in the fucking cold as weather, friends, driving, clubs, parties, hehe its funny but I miss that shit.  One day we will go thank god.  I just hope i make it home before x-mas and New Years.  Anyway enough about that.  Im just being a little bitch right now."

"event","I had just gotten off the plain to see my Dad and Stepmom.  I was on leave from the military and was excited as shit to see them.  I hadn't seen them in about a year or so.  I told my Dad I had a ride from the airport to the house, and that he didnt have to meet me there.  I had made prior arrangements with a long time school friend to pick me up since I hadn't seen her in a while.  When I got off she was standing there, and ran up to me with open arms.  I was taken back a little and hugger her back.  It felt so good to be in my home state of Minnesota.  We walked to the lower level to get my gear and then headed for the car.  She started the car and we were on our way.  During the drive we talked about old times and how we used to do some crazy shit.  Just riding in the car looking out the window was nice.  After about 20 mins we finially got to my house.  We got out of the car and I invited her in.  For some reason no one was home so it was just me and her.  I knew she had to work soon so I told her thank you and that I would call her later.  I kissed her good bye and she was on her way.

So im standing in my house home alone and was hungry as shit.  I went to the fridge and looked for something to eat.  It felt wierd to go into my own fridge because i havent done that in a while.  Anyway I found something and popped it in the microwave.  I heard the beep, took my food out then proceeded to eat it.  After I was done I cleaned my dishes and went to check the caller-ID.  I dont know why I was checking the phone but I guess it was just a habbit.  I looked through the names and stopped at one.  It read Caldwell, Jason and then a number.  It couldn't be him.....my brother who I havent seen in like 3 years.  Why would he call here?  Why now?  Did he know I was coming home.  I called the number immediatly and someone answered.  I asked if Jason was there and he asked who I was.  I told him it was his brother Sean.  He yelled out........SEAN!!!!!!!He said it was Darron my other younger brother who I hadn't also seen in like forever.  I was so excited to hear them and I asked who called my house.  My brother Darron said he did.  He said he just called to see if I was there.  He had no idea I was coming that it was just a lucky shot that I was actually there.  I talked to my Brother Jason and told him to come Pick me up.  I was so excited to hear from them and it was only a short while before I would meet them.  I left my dad a message telling him I was gonna step out for a little bit.  If he knew I was gonna see my brother Jason all hell would break loose.  You have to know my family to understand.  I come from a family of criminals.  My mom; One of the biggest female criminals in the Minneapolis area.....shes done everything from massive amounts of drugs, to stealing anything and everything to helping in murders to basically anything.  Shes always in jail or what ever.  I havent seen her in like 7 years.  My Sister fallows in her footsteps.  She does all that shit to but I dont think shes been involved in killing.  She basically lives on the streets and is a drug addict/prostitute.  My Brother Jason who is a former Crips member is way fucked up.  He was a big time drug dealer in the midwest.  They called him the black John Gotti.  He is only half black but they dont know that.  I mean just looking at him you wouldnt know cause hes so dark.  He's been involved in numerous murders and tells me where he puts the bodies.  He says he puts them on his farm in some pig trough and that the pigs eat everything.  Then there is my little brother Darron.  He and I have been raised in many foster homes and didnt really have a glamerous life but oh well thats another story.  Hes only 15 and he does lots of drugs, steals and basically doesnt give a fuck about anything.  I can tell though he just wants to be loved.  His father died a while back from drugs and I think that had a big impact on him.  All of us share the same mother and shes about to die.  She has so many diseases and has done so many drugs that she barely made it through her second heart attack.  Shes in the hospitol now from what I'm told but I have made no plans to see her.  I know when she dies my little brother will have no one left.  I guess he was living with my brother at that time so maybe my brother will adopt him.

Anyway back to the story.  So I have Jason meet me at McDonalds down from where I live.  I finially get to see him and my brother Darron.  I run up to them excited as hell and hug them both.  We chill and talk and they take me over to his place.  It was good for me and for them to see each other.  After a while I called my friend Jake and Emmie and told them I wanted them to meet my brothers.  They both came over in Emmie's car and I introduced them to both my brothers.  It began to get dark out.  By the time night hit we had like 13 people over my brothers house.  All of us drinking and having a good time.  

My brother Jason comes out of his room with this Grayish Pink ball.  It was all chalky and shit and i didnt know what the hell it was.  He sat down and told me to come over there.  He asked if I had ever done crystal meth before and I told him no I haven't.  He asked if i wanted some and i said sure.  He cut up and thick line and told me to snort it.  I was a little scared but bent down plugged one nose and sniffed hard.  It tasted nasty as shit.  I could feel it draining down my throat and i kept having to swallow.  After a few minutes i was feeling good.  My heart was thumping fast and I became really socialble with everyone.  He put another line and I sniffed that one with no hessitation.  After a few more minutes I was even feeling better.  I asked for a third line and he looked at me as if i was crazy.  He was like are you sure you can handle this? I was like yeah no problem.  I bent down and took it all up.  After the third line I was running around all crazy and shit and just wanted to run and run.  I went outside and just ran.  After that got old i went back into my brothers house.  Everyone was having a good time.  My bro even let my friends have some.  I was like Jason this shit is fucking awesome.  He looked at me and smiled.  I was like dont worry bro ill hook you up with $100.00.......i just wanted a little more.  He put some in his glass pipe and i smoked some of it.  Man I was in fucking heaven....it was like a strong roll.....a roll where you are at the highest point in your roll.

After we were done with the meth he asked if I could get some weed and i said yeah i would try.  I called a friend and asked him if he could get an ounce of weed for me.  He said yeah and gave me a price.  I said alright and to meet me at some point.  Before I left my bro gave me his 9MM and told me i was gonna rob his ass.  I was so fucked up that i agreed to do it I said no problem.  I had never robbed someone and it was gonna be fun.  My brother had me take emmie's car and had his friend Sam go with me....just in case anything happened.

Sam and I got in the car and zoomed to the House we were sopposed to meet at.  We honked the horn and waited.  I was nervous as shit and was like man we cant just rob his ass.  I said sam this is what we are gonna do.  When the guy gives us the weed to check out you put the gun to my head and that way it will look like you are robbing us both.  Ill just tell the guy later that i met you at a party and That I didnt really know you.  He agreed and so we waited.  

Finially this little kid comes out and i recognized him immiedialty.  It was my friends little brother.  I was like what the fuck is this.  The kid jumped in the back and by that time i was like fuck.  He says that we have to go down a few blocks to meet the other kid.  We drive and we finially stop and the kid gets out.  A few minutes later the kid and other kid come walking up to the car.  The kid shows us the weed and I hand it to my friend in the car.  He looks at it and is pleased.  He then pulls out his gun and puts it to my head.  The other kid just stood there in horror and I tried to keep a scared face but inside i was laughing my ass off.  He holds it to my head and says drive.  Im like playing along and say what do you mean and i start babbling something.  He then points it at the kid and the kid seriously pissed himself and ran.  I drove off and we were laughing our asses off.

We finially got to my brothers house and jumped through the door.  He was happy that we got the weed and he started break it apart.  I handed him his gun and was happy.  That was like the most exciting thing I have ever done.  When my high came down I couldnt believe i had done it and just felt bad that i robbed someone.  I couldnt even talk to that person anymore because of what i had done.  Oh well we live and learn."

"event","Well today is Halloween.  A day to go out and get your sacks filled with candy.  Well since im stuck here in uzbekistan i guess i wont be able to get any candy today.  Yeah Yeah i know im 22 years old but damn it i still love candy too.  Last Halloween I really didnt trick or treat, well i treated alot with my friend Morgan.  You might know my friend Capt Morgan.  He's always there for me when times are rough and when im lonely.  Ill be chillin and he will yell out, ""arrrgghh maity, come help me swab the decks in the seven seas.""  Ill look at him and laugh but he knows i will need him and i shouldnt delay the inevitable.  So ill go to where the voices tell me too and pick up that nice sugar brown, spiced rum bottle.  You know the bottle where my friend and his feathered friend sit on the ship with all the gold, looking all happy and having a good time.  Damn Capt., always corrupting my fucking head.

So I take Mr. Morgan and we go out to party at some Halloween bash.  If it werent for the Capt. to keep me entertained then the party would have sucked.  I dont know maybe parties are getting more and more pathetic.  People just sitting there talking, not really doing anything.  People keeping to themselves or locked in the little social clubs they represent.  I dont know,,,,I just was bored and ready to go see what else this small town of Fayetteville had to offer, so i left.

I'm one of those people who will do things on the spur of the moment.  For example:  As of right now I dont have a car.  I live about 8 miles from the mall.  One day i wanted to go to the mall.  How do i get there?  I decide to take my skateboard to the highway and skate there.  Pretty fucking crazy.  People honking their horns and people telling me to fuck off and you know what it was fun.  I decided to do it once a week.  Hey its good excersize and i fuck with people.

So anyway I leave the party on foot.  I dont think there was anyway i could drive so i just started walking.  As i was walking i saw kids in different costumes ranging from witches to bumbs.  They were quite ammusing.  My beligerant ass was just laughing remembering how when i was a kid.  How excited i was to go door to door getting all those goods.  How i used to carve pumpkins with evil faces and eat the seeds.  Oh god how i wish i could go back in time and be a kid again, where times were simpler.  

It was about 11 at night and i was about 6 miles away from my room.  I just kept walking/staggering towards the north star.....the direction to my room.  I would walk past parties and wonder if theirs was any better then the last one i was at.  Probably not.  

My Best buddy was running out.  He need to be replaced quick, so i ran and ran until i saw the harsh lights from a nearby gas station.  I went in and turn directly towars the freezer and walked up to it.  I stared in awe at all the pretty colors from each of the neatly detailed 40 ounces.  The one that caught my eye this time was King Cobra.....the cheepest one there....only $1.05.  I was happy and bought it.  I walked out of the store and resumed my mission....although i really didnt have a mission....but what ever.

I was walking again and like 20 mins later i saw a bumb looking through the garbage.  I went up to him and introduced my self.  He told me who he was and i asked him if he minded my company.  He didnt mind at all,,,,,just as long as i shared my king with him.  I told him sure and told him to wait and i went to the store and bought some more at another gas station.  we drank and drank and drank.  We talked about things and how he ended up where he was at.  I think a lot of his talk was bull shit but it amused me none the less.  I shared with him my problems and he seemed amused.  

well after that got old i told him i had to go.  He didnt want me to go but i still had to get to my room.  We said our farewells and i gave him some money to get something to eat.  Shit i was hungry myself.  I had about 30 mins to spare and i saw my all time favorite place to eat.......Taco Bell. fuck yeah i thought.  I ran up to the door and pulled hard.  It wouldnt fuckin open so i pulled again.  Some person on the other side of the glass looked at me and told me the lobby was closed and that i needed to go through the drive through.  I was thinking fuck.  Well my ass goes behind a car and pretends to be in an invisible car.  I pretend to put my car in gear one and drive/walk up to the window.  When i got to the window i even pretended to turn down the music that i was creating.  She looked at me with a snotty face and was like im sorry sir but you need a car to go through the drive thru.  I pleaded with her but she wasnt having it.....so i told her to fuck off and i left.  God i was so fucking pissed you couldnt even imagine.  I was also so hungry.  

I kept going and finially made it to my base.  I got to the 24 hour shoppette and bought some microwavable hamburgers.  They tasted good as shit.  Even MRE's taste good as shit if your drunk and hungry.  Well it looks like my day is almost over.  After eating i go to my builing i live in.  I walk up the stairs and unlock my door to my room.  I walk in and look around....no one there.  I took my clothes off and got ready for my shower before i went to bed.  On the way to the shower i passed my fridge....well i still had some vodka in there so i took it out and drank some of it.  I really dont know what happened after that i think i passed out on the floor half naked.  Oh well i guess Halloween wasnt that bad after all that day."

"event","I was getting ready to join the military.  All i had was a few days ago.  My friends asked if i wanted to go to a party and so i said sure.  I then called my friend Jessica and asked if she would accompany me.  She was more then happy since i was going to leave in a few days.  I picked her up and then we proceeded to janos house.  When we got there a lot of my friends were there from highschool and we said our hellos and shit then went straigt for the alcohol.  Everything was good and we were all good and buzzed.  When i drink i drink to get drunk and i sure as hell was going to get fucked up.  I guess my friend Jessica had the same idea becuase she was puttin down the bottle of 151 to herself.  We were so fucked up i couldnt even really tell where i was anymore.  My friend Jessica gets up and asks me to come with her.  I fallow her and she goes into some room.  We get inside and i realize its a bathroom.  She pulls me in and locks the door.  She begins to pull off her pants.  Her pants are off now and shes just standing there in her underwear.  I was kinda slumped leaning on the door kinda laughing becuase i wasnt aware of her intentions at that point.  She comes up to me and starts kissing me and my mind is racing like what the fuck is going on.  I was like what are you doing we are just friends.  She kept kissing me and feeling my dick through my pants.  I fell back and was just kinda laying there surprised as hell.  I really couldnt move all that much to get her off.  I did not want to get in this kind of shit with a good friend in fear of losing that friendship.  But i got hard as hell anyway....i mean come on now im a guy....if some girls playing with your shit whether you like it or not its gonna get hard.  She then takes my pants off and im still saying that this is not a good idea and that she should stop.  So im sitting there with no pants and no boxers and shes performing oral on me and man she was going to town.  She took of her panties and mounted me.  She was going up and down and it felt so good and i was telling her to stop.  I tried to roll over but was to fucked up...i just kinda laid there and shit.  I really wanted her to get off but after a while i was started to feel so fucking good that i got into it and we did it every style i could think of with my uncordinated self.  After i went i just kinda laid in disbelief....i sobered my self up a little more and just new this was gonna be wierd from now on.  Well after i was good to drive again we headed for her house.  before she got out we had sex again and i didnt mind but that was about the last time i had ever talked to her again.  oh well i guess it was fun while it lasted."

"event","I met a female on Aol one day.  It was sort of a blind date sort of thing and well when i finially saw her i was very displeased.  she was so hideous that i wanted to run but i didnt.  We met at applebees and i said that i would take her out.  We sat down and i was a little nervous because i was in a wierd situation.  We began talking and she had mentioned something about ecstasy.  I told her i had never tried and i saw here eyes light up.  She asked if i would like to try and i told her hells yeah.  Ive triend other drugs and love all kinds so i said what the hell.  I asked her about them and she explained what would happen when i took them.  i was excited now and was happy i had met this girl.  I asked her how much and she replied only $7.00 for a tripple stacked stickman pill.  I later found out that that price was pretty fucking good.

we finially left the restaurant and she made some phone calls and so did i.  She called the dealer and i called some other friends to see if they were interested.  I said i would meet up with them at the hotel that they would later get.  we got to the dealers house and i fallowed my friend inside.  as soon as i entered there was this guy who was laying on the couch and looking fucked up as hell.  his eyes were rolling in the back of his head and was shaking with a smile on his face.  I was thinking this is some bullshit and he was acting to steal my money....anyway i didnt care and gave in and bought 20 pills.

I took 2 of them and got in the car and started driving....no lie in like 10 minutes them bitches kicked in.  the first thing i noticed was i felt good as shit.  then it was dark and i noticed that the lights outside were like prisms.  By the time i finially got to the hotel i was so fucked up and shaking and happy as a mother fucker that when my friends saw me they just knew that these pills were gonna be the fuking bomb.  after about 30 mins everyone in the hotel was rolling.  My friends new it was my first time and kept blowing me up with the vicks inhalers and putting that methol cream around my eyes and nose.  i never felt so fucking good in my life.  My friend who hooked me up with these pills came up to me and i was telling her how much i appreciated it and i was telling her how much i loved her and started kissing her and all and damn when i woke up the next morning we looked at each other and i was just embarrased as hell.  that shit is a strong drug and i reccomend it to anyone."

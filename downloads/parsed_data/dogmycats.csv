"event","Hmm. It is late. I think I will go to bed. What happened today, and recently, with the recently first is: God is so amazing, I pray that in the future I grow more fully into the knowledge of how amazing God is. God's plan is perfect and loving. I pray that God takes my life and my heart, and changes it that it be both a vehicle and a conversation piece to be able to tell people how much God has done. But today was real cool. I went to the college ministry which was awesome, then later went to some meetings about some trips the church might be taking. There's this one after school is over that they bike all around the mid-US, worshipping and serving God, for seven days. And there is also a mission trip thing they might be able to do if we don't go to war or super defconness. I pray that I be humble and patient, very difficult for me, and that God does His will, whatever it is."

"event","I don't really like writting about what's going on. My life is really interesting to me, but usually the only I can tell anyone about makes me wretch later on. I wish I could write like Ernest Hemingway or Thornton Wilder. Or actually, truthfully, I wish I could write like Kelly. I'm talking about frequency and volume, of course, but moreso, the smoothness and reality inherent in the text. Should I lose my whole analytical thing I do so much? 
 
 I used to like telling stories, or writing them. But I think those too were just early forms of my modern day essay. Still though, maybe I can, by a dint of hard work, start over my literary character, and instead of just being weird and clever, become this neat writing guy. Ha. And maybe I can stop mumbling and being illegible in my speech. Maybe I can stop being careless and forgetful. Shesh. Or maybe I can just write about a guy that I really would like to be. So, I think thats what I was doing before with this thing. Ha! Maybe I can stop using the word ""I"" five times in a minute."

There are about twenty five people left in the whole five floors of Cawthon Hall, minus the Ra's, those crazy egyptian sun people. So I thought ""It would be really cool if we could play hide and seek. Hey! Let's play Hide and Seek!"" So my friend and I went and knocked on everyone's door. The results personified:

Playing dead.   This was large majority of people. These were either hiding under their bed from a radioactive turkey-mashed potato creature, frightened from their bird's eye view of my Frankenstein-esqueness, or dreaming their little home for the holidays dreams.

Playing hooky.  This was the unbelievably small minority of people. These were either straight up lying to me, or were actually very busy or very sick.

  I am surrounded much by music. Cds, practice, concerts, rehearsals, whatnot. It was saturating my head with syrupy head goo. There was a Wycliff Gordon/Fsu jazz concert. And it was cool and professional. But who cares about that anymore? Philip Glass Piano Music is this cd I took/stole from the Fsu library this morning. Also in the selection was his second opera ""Satyagraha"", Chanticleer with their a capellaness, and the opera ""der Vampyr"". So I put in the piano one. And so! Bam! awesome! within 10 seconds, my face was cleared of all thought. The first track is ""Wichita Vortex Sutra"", which is like the monkey fattest stamp title I've ever heard. So, I had to tear the cd from my computer, which appreciated its quality, and run, with craziness, down the hall to peoples rooms and say ""Hey, listen to this now."" Of course, they didn't kill and eat me because they knew who I was. But, the weird thing is, their robot heads didnt bust off after five seconds. So back to my room. Franks stereo supports 40 volume levels. These people, these dorm monitory people, which I haven't seen do anything discipliney, said ""Oh, it's too loud....blabberty blabberty.......quiet hours....poop poop."" So, I turned it down all the way to 25. But! Ha. It's still the best piano music ever written, even at a peepeepianissimo level. Ha! Their minds of doom weren't shoveled in by the brief exposure. Oh, oh oh oh.

  Speaking of flushing, I'll relate geekness to you in terms of Flushing the field. 0% would be like super top performance, the sousaphones run around the seminole head in the middle of the field and it looks like a proper toilet. 50% is where they all trip on the lines painted on the field and break their glasses. 100% is where they run around, and then a giant mole demon turns the dirt into a toilet, and they all get flushed to the moley nether regions."

Ok. I had to pick up my tux right after chiefs and I was a little worn out from stuff, but it was cool. The concert freaking was awesome. Harmonie played some good little ensemble stuff and Symphonic band did really well on most of the stuff, although some people thought they did badly. Subcity, computer, sleep. today-4 am wake up! Wait and read Bible and sleep outside of school music. at 5:30 they unlocked the doors and I could get in. I practiced some and ate and went to classes. then sight singing we had a test (which I personally feel as though robbed. The teacher was supposed to play this tune 5 times so we could right it down. i would swear she played it 4 times. But i dont care really now.)Then, now ten minutes ago. I called  housing and tried to pay the bare minimum to not be fined a $100. But she said I had to pay it all. 192.68 today. I gave them 30, out of the 40 that some how appeared in my account. Weird. Luckily, its only a 10 dollar fine per month. so Bam, that kind of sucked, but what does it matter. Now I have English in 20 minutes.
  This is so important that it needs its own paragraph. 
  It is cold today! Its not that hot, melty, humid junk garbage. It was brisk and LOVELY. As I ran to physics, it was like sitting in a chair, drinking sprite, watching MASH. It was awesome weather.
   Will you look at all those numbers in the entry! That totally has to add up to 30.16. So I am finally done with my 200x200x200 cube of digging. Whew!

"event","About the concert I went to yesterday. It was fun and good. There was this one trio for clarinet, cello, and piano, that I really liked. I didnt like the clarniet all that much. And the piano was nothing to write home page about, except for the fact that I'm writing about it right now. But it is definitely nothing to write 2 lines about. But the cello was BODAcaious. I love cello so much that if it was a dog, and I was an antfarmer, I would eat its face off. I don't know if you have seen the independant film ""Hillary and Jackie"" but then again I dont really care. It was a fine movie about this cello playing sister who wasnt good, until her flute playing sister was really good, then she started practicing like a clotheshorse, and she became world famously good, after several years the flute one was mediocre and got married, and the cello one was among the best and went _____. Haha, I blanked it out so you dont know how it ends. It's funny! It was a weird thing to be inspired from, but it did the coalman's job. So anyways, the cello is like the tuba of the wood fairies, no fairies gives you a gay impression but I wont bother deleting it when I have so many other keys I havent pressed yet, its like the Great Wooden Tuba of All-Time-And-Space. The sound is tremendous. The guy that played it was this old foreign guy in  a black velvet jacket that looked really cool, I wasnt sure if it was him, so I didn't pee my appreciation on him.

   The dirt was muddy, the weather had been rainy before today. I can't just go down there and work left to right. I must start at the top and work down. But you know how I survive? There are little plants growing in the forest that turn dirt into bread and mud into water. It's not much, but it feels good and satisfying.

The first one was just like a ""get acquainted with your zombie teacher"" one, but turned quickly into ""listen for a long tim to the zombie lectures."" I have theory M,W,F, which I'm pretty excited about, I can't remember who he reminds me of, but it's definitely someone. I ended up doing lots and lots of extra work than was assigned for he next day, mostly by aggravating accident, and some on purpose, but it was cool because we had a test and it seemed really easy. Class Piano, Fundamental Physics, Sightsinging/eartraining, and Critical writing are on T, Th. Oh yeah, DOOM! Piano is fun/overwhelming at times, but I think I could do really well as I get more comfortable playing in that awful treble cleff (SHAKES FIST FIERCELY)and with two hands at once. Somehow I learned to play Bright Lights Boogie pretty well, although it wasnt assigned, but whenever I play it for someone they laugh strangely. Physics is long and its mostly all copying what he writes on the board, I'll have to read lots of the book to really stay ahead. Mr. Physics reminds me of the old jewish teacher from Boston Public. S/E is alright, Ms. Singear reminds me ALOT of Rachel Hammond. So much it's ....scary? English is a good class to be in if you like to write, but I think it should be called ""Tim's happy fun time hour time of funny happy reading time"" Chiefs is always 4-6 M-F, and it's always bloody doom-ridden fun. Hot Show 1 performance was pretty cool, but I havent memorized all the little songs for every occasion yet. Patriotic Show 2 is coming out next week, and we're starting to look at the Duke tribute jazz music for show 3 also next week. Yawn. Band is here and then, and is going well, with much fun and learning opportunities. Yawn, Boo Yawn. The honors colloquim and music one and the cawthon one are much scary boring so far. I just had my 2nd lesson at 10-11am. Man, I thought I was practicing like a fiend the whole week, like for very much time and with good criticism of it and all, and mind you I'm not saying it wasnt worth it or it was bad today because it was a lot better than before I think, but all the good stuff he said about what I should do to be better at it was all, like, wow, I have to do much practice in a different way. But we have Tuba Euphonium studio today at 2:30. Plus, I'm really looking forward to getting together with the quintet we're trying to do, and do stuff today, and if we don't I'll pummel you to WolfmanTown. My finger nails are growing very nicely, except number 4a got a hair cut accidentally over the past week and is a few centimeters short. I apply dislike, as strongly as I would to anyone, to Eminem. Ok that's it. 
    22 periods of 20 minutes on that stuff is how much is on this sheet log, so anyway. Over the past week I dug 22 rows. That makes 40.5

"event","I have been busy and then not so much, so the thing is I'm finally willing to get with the writing of this thing on a somewhat consistent basis. I posted first on 8-01, and today is early on my birthday 9-4, so since a month ago a lot has happened and been done. That weekend afterwards was just a normal one, we watched men in black and stuff. The week was just being bored sitting around. Weekend 2 was when I started thinking about the audition for chiefs and how I need to order all this stuff. Week 2 was a gradual process of getting stuff ready, closing accounts, appraising property, cleaning room, packing clothes, and getting to where I could leave and it wouldn't seem all of a sudden and panicky. We went out to eat for like a birthday in advance party, which was cool. Dad and I left around 4-5 a.m., and everyone else was up for goodbyes. It was nice. The drive up was cool, very cold and starry and clear, with lots of good music and sub. We got to HMU stood in lines, auditioned on sousaphone, got everything assigned for preseason rookie camp. The Royal Flush is the sousaphone section of chiefs, and the 14 Flush Kidz we started off with went down to 12 then up to 13 at the end of the week. It was really, really very hard on my brain and feet and stuff the week was. We kidz did so much together, that when we finally were allowed to take off our number tags and were told that we all made it, I think we still hang out most of the time untill school started. It again was hard. The feeling you get when you make a commitment to wake up every morning and run a couple miles, and when you've done it for a bit, so when one morning comes that you're extremely tired and aching, and its physically, also the mentals affecting physicality, difficult to get up, the whole week was like that. I would wake up and want to throw up how bad I was feeling, and on the field when it seemed like they were disappointed in what you did, although until then you had thought you were trying really hard and doing pretty well, then you instantly think that you're a terrible person for making someone feel so lousy about your progress. I drank so much water, and showered in so much water, and sweated so much water, to be around so much liquid, you'd think I could stand some mind jarring heat, but it just seemed like I couldn't move anything at all. It was most likely the hardest week on my brain and being that I've ever experienced. But the thing was, I'd always be renewing my focus and resolving to push it harder, and stick it out until the next water break, and when one session practice was over, I'd feel like nothing else, relieved and dead tired, and each time it would add a new little memory of goodness to my file, and I'd be able to pull it out when it's tough and remember that I was able to complete such and such without dying or crying or getting really down on the experience. It's like when you play an online role-playing game and the first few levels are really difficult to a newbie, you are unskilled, unfamiliar, isolated, and vulnerable as the weakest level one wizard, so It's just really hard to gain levels and stuff when you have absolutely nothing, but when you go to the zoo with all the easy animals, it snowballs into this big great character. I'm saying that it becomes with every step more possible. Then it happens that you become what you want and gets crazy fun, while you learn about the people that tried to help you by being so incredibly tough and scary, as well as the other kids youve gotten to know very well. I came out of it only knowing flush, then I met people in Cawthon, which were mostly in music or education or music education, like my roommate for crying out loud. Then I was able to get to know some chiefs, although its that Flush is like a separate entity apart from chiefs, and seemingly not touching at any points, but then I saw how it fits. We went to Josh's apartment to watch the game, and did some stuff in a groupy sort of capacity. I was dog tired Sunday. The first week of classes was alright, neat liberal arts teachers as well as music ones. I can't tell yet how they'll turn out, but I can make good predictions. It seems like I'm just throwing mad money away at books, chiefs stuff, tuba stuff, assorted necessities, and washing clothes. And the meal plan. It doesn't bother me right now, but it may soon, It seems to when I think about it and I care about stupid little stuff like stocks and whatnot. The mealplan is alright, I just need to manage it. 
    So what I did with my house today was this: I took all the word count of this entry and added it to the count of a composition I did for English, which I might post later as a test of how cool others think my writing is as opposed to my biased view, that came to 1562. Then I asked Frank for a number 1-6, kind of like a literature skills modifier, it was a 4 and I multiplied them which is 6248. I felt like I had done a lot of good work and, since each of the rows I'm digging is 200 long by 20 deep, that's 4000 a row, I felt like I deserve more work than 1 and a half rows, so I multiplied it by 10, then divided by 4000 and got 15.62, which a satisfying number although not rounded, so I'll change  the digits around 16.50, which might be about right if you add in this last bit. So I'll add eleven words to make it fit the rubric."

"event","So this is the first one already. I don't do all that much on a daily basis, so I guess this'll have to be just some dumb random talking in my head into the keyboard machine. But it's kind of hard to start writing a thing when your trying to, I find it helps alot to be distracted by something thats pretty interesting but extremely monotonous so if you miss some of it you can fix your memory of the gap with just some random derivation. 
   I thought the tab button used to indent paragraphs.
   Paragraphs, I think, will be at random, but i'll try to give them some meat and fries so they don't get it little eating disorders. 
   I had this idea on this one bus ride thing. I was going to build a house in my head, of course not a physical house but a mental one. What I did so far was start in a clearing in a forest, then walked in a 200x200 square, where everytime I tapped my hand I moved one foot. After that I started digging 20 feet down, but I only got like two rows done, so maybe I can use this thing to finish it."

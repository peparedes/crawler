"event","Sometimes I just can't sleep . Sometimes im just absolutely miserable and don't know how to handle it.  I was thinking about seeing a therapist but its not like they can fix anything . They can't make my mom better and as long as she's sick  I will worry and worrying is what eats away at me.  Its not fair , I still don't understand why it happened to her.   Sometimes when im in a bad mood people ask me why im sad and I kinda just look at them , a lot of people just don't put two and two together , and think , how would you feel if it was your mother ? I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders sometimes.  I've been doing so much I barely have time to breathe. My father telling me I can't go to school for a year pretty much crushed me.  I drove by my school today and got a little teary eyed which is so ridiculous because I hate school.  But he's holding me back and I think its selfish on his part , but im doing it for my mom , even though she has nothing to do with it.
 So a few weeks ago I went to the cancer building for the first time to take my mom for chemo.  The whole day I was trying not to cry.  On the windows in the hallway there were hundreds of little posters the kids with cancer made with words of encouragement and pictures and I couldn't even look at them it was the most inspirational and saddest thing at the same time.  Those poor kids it breaks my heart so much.  You really don't realize these things until they become a reality to you and affect your life. Its insane.  
Sometimes I close my eyes and I see those windows and I just feel empty inside.

"event","Before I went to bed last night I asked my guardian angel to talk to me , to give me a sign to show me anything she could.  I don't pray to god because I don't understand I don't have that faith, I wish I did but its just really hard for me.  I talk to my guardian angel, my spirit guide, whatever she may be.  I've seen her before in my dreams.  She's beautiful.  I had an awful nightmare and I didn't connect it till now.  In my nightmare I was in my house, my parents went to the hospital for my moms surgery, me and pat were downstairs in the cellar (I dno what this has to do with anything but my mom had an incident down the cellar two months ago where something threw a box full of junk down the stairs , that night I had a dream about a shadowed man in her room then I saw with my own two eyes a shadowed man in her doorway that next day) and we heard runnng and footysteps upstairs and we got upstairs and there was like a torando everything was knocked down, the blinds were moving up and down fast, there was knocking, glass. It was terrible.  I got a phonecall,  it was a spirit.  She was telling me shed be here soon to remove them, but we have to wait it out for a while.  I told her we need her now, she said in time.  I went to leave and at the end of the hallway there was a huge man, skeleton, huge bones, just a very big monster.  I woke up, so scared and alone.  I immidietly went to get pat because I was so scared.  But she said shes going to fix it. And I believe my spirit guide sent her to tell me that.  I have never heard my angel talk, so im not sure it was her, I don't feel it was her, this girl was telling me her name was wendy (my spirit guide has come to me with an s name , shane she told me once but I fekt it could be sarah or shaina) but I've seen her walking with a light around her, with her long hair flowing as she walks, a reassuring smile aways on her face.  Another time I saw her sitting on the moon, pointing me in the right direction, running in sinking sand.  I haven't seen her much, but I've seen and felt her pressence enough to know she watches me.  This angel is the only faith I have , she's what ibbelieve in, she's who I talk to.  Maybe she is my equivilent to god, maybe she is my god.  I will not put that much pressure on her.   She merely tells me what's happening, she can't change it.  I can't change it.
Today I learned that my mothers cancer has spread, they removed her ovaries and part of her intestine.  She has two or more tumors still in her body.  She will not know about those because my dads plan is to tell her everything is fine and she will make it through.  The reality is ovarian cancer is strong and she could have had it for years and there is hope for remission but the doctors say it comes back with a vengence.  My dad exagerates, but he says we will be lucky if we have 3 years. He said , would you rather her have chemo that turns her into a zombie so she can have a few extra years , or would you rather her have moderate chemo that keeps her in remission for a few years, but enough that she will be able to go out and work and be happy.  Of course I want her to enjoy life.  I want her to live.  I want her to live her life.  I don't know what its like to be without a mother.  I don't wamt to think about that.  My dad and I cried for hours together.  He doesn't want to be alone.  He's going to ask my uncle to move in.  He doesn't want me to ever leave him alone.  Were all he has.  My grandmother was crying I've never seen her cry.  He told me tomorrow not to cry when I see her. He wants her to think everythings fine , how can I not cry when I see her.  I can't fix it, the doctors don't even know how.  They know how to calm it for a few years , but then what.  What happens when her body is immune to the chemo.  What happens next.  I don't want to ever think of that.  This is all a nightmare it has to be. I can't lose my mom.  My dad can't lose her.  He won't be able to handle it.  I won't be able to handle losing my mom and then losing my dad.  I've never ben so scared.  What happens next, that's all I want to know.  I want to look into the future and see my mom being at my wedding, being there when I graduate college, being a grandmother, I want to know its all there in the future.  That she will make it through this and be there for everything.  I won't put her in a nursing home.  Ill help her and my dad afford somewhere to live when thehyre old and can't work, hell ill get a house with an inlaw apartment, something I never wanted. I've spent my adolecent years trying to get away now all I want is them with me forever.  They drive me crazy but what will I do without them.  What's life without them . How did this happen.  All I want to know is what happens next."

"event","When something lifechanging happens I guess I always come here because I can only verbally get so much out without havung a nervous breakdown.  And there's only 2 people I can really talk to.  And talking does me no good because I cry.  And I hate telling the same story. And now the story has changed so its going to be even harder. I can't talk to my dad because he just repeats , its so bad, over and over.  Sadly many people both my mother and I thought would pull through in a time like this haven't , and I am actually very very surprised, she isn't.  Its sad that times like this you learn so much about people. People you think are close to you.  That my work friends , have sent my mom cards , when family haven't even called.  Maybe I just expect too much. All I know is , I come home and my house is so quiet and it feels empty and sad.  I've never felt anything like it , but it hits me as soon as I walk in the door. And last night was the worst.  But tonight was bad too. Ill never get used to it. And im hoping and looking forward to the day it ends.  Im usually optimistic , I wish I could say everything could be okay and mean it.  How did that 15% chance come through ? These past weeks I have prayed, and I really can't tell you the last time I've prayed, im far from religious.  But I guess that put everything out there for me.  Why would god do ths to my mother, who has done nothing to hurt anyone.  Who has a heart of gold,, gives her all to her job everyday working with the elderly. Does everything for me, im basically spoiled rotten.  She takes me to the doctors all the time when im sick stays all night with me at hospitals throughout my redic amount of illnesses.  Puts up with all my bullshit, we fight a lot but I still love her so much.  She dosnt deserve any of this.  I feel awful that my father won't let me go with them but I guess I would just be baggage anyway.
Through alll this im so happy and grateful that I have my patrick I don't know what id do without him id just be home crying all day like I am right now.  But when im with him my mind is free.and if I need to talk he's always there he always has something encouring and reassuring to say no matter what.  But most of all he just gets my mind off things.  Being with him is so different than anyone else. I don't think I could ever explain it no matter how much I tried.  Its just so simple , not what I was used to in the past , but the way things should be.
Im dreading 10 hours of work tomorroew because im gunna have to tell the story at least 6 times. Maybe I can get away with the I don't wanna talk about it line. Because I can't be stuck alone in my mind for 10 hours.  I always think too much at work, I don't know why."

"event","I know I complain about my parents all the time and obviously I don't mean basically any of what I say.  But there's last few weeks have been absolutely horrific.  Finding out my mother has cancer is the most devestating and heartbreaking news I have ever gotten.  I pray that everything works out for her because she does nnot deserve this. I've never felt so completely lost and helpless. I just wish I could take it away."

"event","I can't sleep anymore , I messed up my sleeping sched the past few nights. Because I was up till 3am everynight being a huge nerd reading twilight. And I will permanently mess up my sleeping sched because I have 3 more books and then maybe by that time ill be able to look forward to the edward version, or read it on the internet. I really didn't wanna get involved in the twilight nonsense, because I thought it was gahabge , but its good shit. And I must see the movie asap!!!
Anyways im here because there's nothing on tv , and im covinced there's someone living in my alley way , also because there is a ghost in my room and im sure he will eventually show himself again and I will have a heart attack.
Im exhausted but everytime I close my eyes my head just races about nothing at all. And I have to keep my ipod on because if I dont I hear things or banging on my window. Maybe im just going absolutely looney tunes , sounds like it to me lol
I've been over reacting about too much lately , I really think I need a vacation of some sort. And by vacation, I mean stay in bed for a week and eat ice cream and watch tv all day. Speaking of tv , gossip girl needs to come back soon. And I can't wait for my preggers girl show. And niptuck and maybe someday rescueme will actually do full episodes isntead of 5 min b.s. Tomorrow night I decided im just gunna write my whole rough draft on gay marriage or whatever I decide, and pass it in tuesday even though its not due for another week, have her check it, pass in the final thursday, call it a day and get an a in the class and get an extra week and a half off.  I can't wait till december 15, in all honesty I have a very good feeling about this day and I am pretty sure doctor feldman is going to tell me my braces are coming off soon and he's going to mold my retainer. And I will be so happy to be brace free even though I might miss them for a while because sometimes I enjoy looking like a 12 year old! I haven't decided if that was sarcasm or not. Im very curious about what ill look like without my metal mouth, I forget what it feels like.  First thing im gunna do is bite into a big apple, maybe chew some celery , eat a gummy bear in a matter of seconds instead of chewing for 2 minutes and eventually losing the bear.
Im really tired of school , im tired of this prerequisite b.s., I wanna get in the program as soon as possible, finish, and get away from my shittyy job, and get a real job , making real money.  I wanna pay off all my debt so bad , it bums me out every week when I get paid and I only keep 20 dollars for gas and like 10 dollars for food for the week.  I wish I never got myself into this mess.  I say I leaned my lesson , but have I? If I didn't cut my charges up, id still use them.  I have the numbers so technically I can still use them, and that's dangerous.  I have spending issues.  I spoiled myself last year buying anything and everything I wanted, and I have nothing to show for it.  I was depressed I guess.  Im happy now but im dissapointed that I allowed myself to sink that low.
I feel like I've went through really weird stages, and I hope I stay in the stage im in now for the rest of my life because for the most part im just calm; im happy and in love and balanced I guess.  
Last year I was depressed and just miserable. (Not to mention I weighed 116 (lmao) pounds. All I did was work and work out and not eat. I miss being able to fit into my size 3 skinny jeans, but I was unhealthy. I legit used to eat a cup of grapes for dinner. ) If it weren't for pat saving me and making me the happiest person in the world, I probably would have melted.  Sometiems I think about what I would have done without pat, life seems unbearable and impossible, as creepy as that sounds.
The year before that, the only word to describe me was I dno, retarded! I look back and honestly I feel like I wasn't myself.  I was never so blinded and confused. And I just wanna go back in time and just slap myself for being a moron.  I learned from that though.  I definately learned you can't help someone who doesn't want help.  That's the hardest lesson I've learned I guess.  Sometimes I wish it never happened, but then sometimes I feel like without that time in my life I wouldn't be who I am today.  I just don't like when people bring up the past, and it seems for some reason , many people like to do that. And its kindof a slap in the face. But I deserve it haha, everyone makes mistakes.  The onlt thing that matters is if you learn from them.
Id love to sleep , but considering I've been laying in bed since 11, doesn't look too promising.

I guess its time to eat catfood and huff some glue to get some actual sleep - as my charles would of course."

"event","I can honestly say that im the happiest I've ever been and it keeps getting better. Well actually im completely absolutely miserable with my home life , everythings been going wrong . But knowing I can escape it all makes everything ok . Im sick of it and im going to be leaving soon. And im excited. I can't wait for me and pat to have our own place and be together even more than we already are.  he absolutely completes me and I can say that we will be together for the resy of our lives with no doubt.  He has managed to change my outlook on everything , he makes me a better person. I feel so lucky and blessed to have him in my life.  I never thought this woudl happen so fast I never thought I could be so happy or rely on someone so much. Its gotten to the point where id be absoluetly nothing without him.  I know that's kinda crazy and anyone else would feel maybe too involved , but I know nothing will go wrong between us , so I have nothing to worry about . He is my soulmate I found my other half. I can't believe its only been 4 months it feels like its  been forever .  4 months seems like abs nothing , I never expected to feel this way about someone even aftera lifetime. I guess time doesn't matter . Ill never forget the first time he looked me in the eyes and told me he was falling in love with me. I felt it too but ibdidnt understand how he could too and how he felt like he could tell me so soon. I always thought there was a time limit on stuff like that.  I was so confused because I never felt that way , it was so differentfrom anything else . And I still get that feeling.  He's everything to me. He's my best friend . I could tell him or ask him anything at all.  I've never felt so safe or comfortable with or around anyone at all.  I know we were made for eachother as corny as that is I know its true!"

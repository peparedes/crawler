"event","Well today we finally had someone come out and candidate for the pastorate of our church. Luis Torrado. He was really wonderful and the vote on it was 31-1. I have no idea who voted against him lol. Even Naomi and Sarah felt very strongly that they wanted him to be the pastor. This guy managed to do a sermon today, and hold the kids attention (remember our kids range from 3-10 years old and the 3 year old is probably autistic or PDD and an 8 yr old is autistic and can be LOUD). He managed to hold the kids attention! Not only that, but the ones who knew how (Chaunte, Cegaan, Kelisa, Naomi) were looking up the passages in their bibles. Even Joe and Joey listened to him. The thing that impressed me was that he held the kids' attention and even though he doesn't know Joey, isn't used to him the whole thing... 

So Joey gets all excited cause he likes this guys story and he gets up and goes and stands behind Joe(his dad not JJ) and grabs his shoulders like he does when he wants someone's attention and yells ""IM AT CHURCH DADDY!!""
Joe: I know honey..
Essy: Shhh
Joey: I am, mom!
Essy: Shut up!
Joey: GAH!

Lol. 

Meanwhile, I told Joe many times over the past two weeks this guy was comin. He talked in the back and I said ""Joe be quiet this guy is  trying out to be our Pastor and he is nervous and you're distracting him."" Joes like ""Okay"" and shuts up. So then ten minutes later he looks at me, points at pastor torrado and says ""Am, who is that guy?"" And Essy burst out laughing and I just said ""He might be our new pastor now hush"" And that was that.

He held the kid's attention, his message was great though and definitely not boring for the adults. That kind of double-interest point really impressed both me and Essy, and the fact that for all of Joe and Joeys talking and Joey deciding at random in the middle of it to start yelling, he didn't flinch, pause, didn't even look back at them like ""what the heck?""

His own son is 23 months and his name is NOLIN. His wife is pregnant too and apparently the baby's a boy. So. Yeah. His kids a little but his son is so adorable. ^^

Oh and Naomi drew me a picture of the powerpuff girls >.> That was sweet"

And as Your mercy falls, I raise my hands
And praise the God who gives, and takes away

However, I am going tonight to meet a woman who needs a babysitter Tuesday night for nine hours to watch her 2 year old daughter, and autistic son, whos age I don't know. I told her I have several year's experience working with an autistic child and she seemed very interested in meeting with me tonight. YAY!

I'm done everyday at 12 and yay! The bus also stops at Franklin Mills on the way back, so one day I'll get off there and go get apps galore. If I really can't keep Paley, which would be my first choice.

Grafton is getting spayed in a few weeks. I need to go to HRS for info on any spay thing like FotA does for cats. If not, I'll just do it anyways.

Next is Ella. Who's getting rather fat and I'm trying to nip it in the bud. She's always been just right for her size, and I wouldn't care about an extra lb but right before surgery is the key there. She's already at risk for a) her tiny size and b) her respiratory system is somewhat weak from the infection she had as a baby.

Work's fine but they call me EVERY FRIKEN MORNING to ask me to come in early. Sometimes so insanely early that even if I rolled out of bed and stepped right on the bus, I couldn't make it. Thats getting old. But I am becoming friends with a girl named Tia. And Taylor and Reed's mom (Taylor is 5 and in my room, Reed is 2 and in Tia's room) drove me and Tia home today because she was late to get her kids and we took them out and signed out so she wouldn't pay 20 dollars. So she drove us home since we missed our bus. She drove me once before. She is very nice. She actually wants me to watch Taylor and Reed on Saturday. I told her I'd let her know for sure tomorrow. I'm going to say yes. I love them they are so adorable. Both have brown hair (Reed's is fluffy and looks like he stuck his finger in an outlet-- Tay's is curly) and light blue eyes. They are both smart and both have a bit of an attitude. They are cute.

"event","I've been doing some research to find out about my ancestors or whatnot. There's a lot of mystery on both sides. My dad is adopted, and I know his birth name, and it's a Scottish name. But it's also a fairly common name, so I can't just call about like 200 people asking if they are related to him. And he doesn't LOOK anything, except maybe Scottish. So maybe he's all Scottish, but what are the odds anymore of being 100% anything?

Moms side: My great-great-grandmother was from the Austro-Hungarian empire but from a village that has probably seen five border changes since she moved to the US about 1910. My great-grandmother doesn't know the name of the village, because it was only mentioned once, when someone in the family sent away for a birth certificate, and the church that held the records for the village had burned down and the records were gone. Her mother's maiden name is Slovak, but the language they spoke was likely Stokavijan, a dialect of Bosnian. The borders have changed so many times that the language and ethnicity probably overlapped. They also lived in an area that was a mix of all Slavic countries and related places.. the languages were so similar that everyone spoke everything at least somewhat and never thought about what their TRUE language was. 

However the one she used at home was Stokavijan, which is spoken in Croatia and parts of Bosnia, by process of elimination by looking up a word my mom remembered her using. It was possible to be a Polish word, but we know for sure that we are not Polish. The word is also used in Stokavijan. Which makes sense for why she was never sure exactly what country they were from. Her mother told them to say that they were Russian, even though they weren't.

So, most likely I am:
1/4 Armenian, 1/8 Luthiunian and/or Ukranian, 1/8 Croatian/Bosnian, and half... Scottish or Scottish and English?

I probably know more now than I did before. I was only positive to be Armenian and Luthiuanian, but now I've figured out what else is quite likely.

Dani scared my today. I thought she was dying. I happened to look over and see her trip, and her foot fell out of the side bar of the cage.. which isn't normal. She then started darting and flopping like a fish.  Which they sometimes do when they are dying, and she's not too strong. So I got her out to check on her and her heartrate was normal and her ears were warm, so I knew she wasn't like DYING but I thought she had to go to Uni. of Penn cause they're open on the weekends and my vet isn't. Well they are downtown and 100 dollars to walk in the door.  I held her for about an hour... and she calmed down.. her heartrate and ears were still normal.. which, when they are dying, their heartrate drops from 350 to about 90 VERY fast... and their ears get like ice. Put her back, got jas out and put her in  a milk crate (Which of course my dad was like BUNNY and couldn't leave her alone) Gave her a HUGE bowl of food and she ate for like an hour and drank a lot. So she isn't dying. And she's walking normal now. But there's nothing to her, she is skin and bones and not quite 2 lbs. She isn't very strong but.. she'll live today.  If its epilepsy there isn't really anything that can be done.. but they rarely die from it.

They still had this fat goofy lop as well, so I watched him for a minute and left. Oh well. It's five minutes from work so I'll go tomorrow.

Aced the test I think.."

<P>I wanted it so bad... I picked up a marten one and he spazzed out and kicked me. I picked up the silver one and it just went limp and smiled and closed its eyes... it's a baby, about the size of a CD or so... but the breed is so tiny (netherland dwarf), that they don't get very big, and its probably still past the 7-week danger zone... It's so adorable.</P>"

"event","Last night was awesome, but today was terrible. So I'll go with the chronological approach.

Prayer service at church last night. Usually I don't have the patience or the attention span, and take the kids upstairs halfway through because they are ready to jump off the walls. Last night it was just Abigail and Michaela though, and while Abby was a bit annoying at first, she calmed down and Michaela, oddly enough, was extremely interested. So I stayed downstairs, and prayed, and such. Well about a year ago during a similar but shorter service, I had this feeling like.. nobody worry about Joey, he's going to be healed. Last night it was like... ""Okay. Now is the time"".. So. I asked about prayer for Joey and everyone prayed and there were so many details of things that were said and happened I can't list in a way that would be reasonable on here. I also spoke in tongues for the first time last night. Wow. I'm there like bhjadfhklafhsdfkjhsfdkh and thinking in the back of my mind ""wow I'm actually speaking in tongues..."" Lol. Stupid me. But praise God... 

Today was terrible though. I got out of work and went to the gym and came out of the gym to finally hear the news that Jellyroll died. I knew there was something wrong with him last night, and this morning his temp was 103.2, which is a bit high, but it was too late to get him to the vet in the morning, so I soaked his ears in cold water, left him a bowl of water and a carrot for hydration and a pile of hay to prevent GI Stasis from setting in. My dad was here today and keeping an eye on him, but he got a shower and when he came back ten minutes later he had died. 

I don't really want to write any more right now. I'm too conflicted, and I have to get ready for class."

"event","I am so exhausted. I went to bed at a reasonable time, about 11:20. But everyone kept talking and coming and going all night. The icing on the cake was Arielle coming out here at like I guess 2:00 and getting on the computer-- light and noise city. Lies and says she just needs to get something, pops on her headphones with some lame excuse about remembering to take them tomorrow, and sits there for at least 30 minutes listening to music and chatting. And she's about the loudest experienced typer I have ever known in my life. She's selfish, and irresponsible, because if she sneaks online and doesn't get caught, she can come up with some lame excuse why she's tired and stay home. I can't do that, and for that reason, since she hogs the bedroom while I sleep on the couch, dad made a rule for her that she MUST be in her room and off the computer for good at 1:00 AM. She doesn't care. She does whatever she wants. 

I got MAYBE 3 hours sleep, so I am not happy here.

Because I am talking to Ryan on the phone,and RPing with him (and Candi) on AIM. 

We're just having so much fun. We RPed, watched Becker, and are RPing some more.

I'll probably get off within the next half hour or so, but I got no where to be tomorrow, so I'm enjoying it.

Mira and Brad are making plans for a date. Anto and Nev are running CBL alone, with Zin and Karou in Spain. Nev's ready to pop and Anto's sick as heck. Fun stuff. Drama drama drama. When's Jackie coming back......

<P><EM>I am so happy because God has blessed me beyond what I could imagine. He has given me the gift of eternal life through the death of His Son Jesus. He has also given me a wonderful family who I love very much. He also has blessed me with new additions to my family; My girlfriend Amy and her family. I love them very much!!! A couple of weeks ago my family was making out our christmas lists and jokingly I wrote the that I wanted a girlfriend and out to the side I wrote I would find this. And little did I know that God was saying,""Ryan, your prayer is answered"". And little did I realize that God would send me the love of my life a week later. Words can't discribe how much I love her and want to be with her for the rest of my life!!! THANK YOU LORD!!!! In other news, I am getting ready to take the SAT in January so I can go to college to get my B.A in Pastoral Ministry. Well, thats it for now.<BR><BR><BR><BR>I LOVE YOU AMY &amp; momflower rocks!</EM>&nbsp; </P>"

"event","Anthony got in a bad car accident and is in the hospital... STICU. Lacerated spleen, cuts and bruises, and they don't know if he'll need surgery. For those of you who don't know, Anthony is the father of three little girls I babysit.. very sweet, smart, beautiful little girls Hannah is 5, Bethani is 3 and Rebecca is 7 months. Bethani has Spina bifida. Anyways, they're great people. Anyone who would, please pray for him and his family. 

I saw on the news some less-than-life-worthy-scumhead-PIG beat a four year old girl, his girlfriend's daughter, to death. Why? She had Spina bifida and he was upset that she wasn't potty trained. IN GENERAL KIDS WITH SPINA BIFIDA CAN'T BE POTTY TRAINED!! MANY OF THEM HAVE SURGERY CAUSE THEY NEED TO HAVE THEIR BLADDERS OPEN FROM UNDER THEIR BELLY BUTTON AND NOT THE REGULAR WAY!!!  (hannah was 22 months when Bethani was born. she told marie she wanted two belly buttons like bethani had, she thought anyway) Apparently, this... I can't even think of what to call IT, didn't know that and decided he was mad and BEAT this girl to death. 

All I could think of was Bethie as I saw her today, sitting there watching Veggietales and happily talking to the inside of her orange plastic bowl which she had been eating ice cream from... her long curly dark blonde hair falling out of its ponytail pathetically as it always does by the end of the day.. her big, thoughtful hazel/indigo eyes staring at everyone thoughtfully who talked to her, befor deciding what to say, if she wants to bother answering at all.. 

Sometimes I hate people. Or the idea that some of these FREAKS walk the streets and that I know that this guy will probably be out of jail within 10 or 20 years or less, IF he goes to jail at all, while people rot for 12 years for tax fraud."

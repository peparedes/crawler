"event","three days to go and she'll be home!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait! She's sent me five post cards so far. I've pinned them up on the wall, with her writing facing out. Her words mean much more to me then the pictures on the cards themselves. They are some beautiful pictures though. Not much else is new. Been working on a chainmaile shirt. That's about it though. Had a lazy kick back weekend. I'm going to finish adding a section to the shirt and then go to bed. Wish I could just sleep till friday, but o well, friday will be here before I know it, but not soon enough."

"event","Erif ma I
Walking atop
Maze walls
A smile upon my face
While the rats
Gaze up 
With thier beady eyes
They wonder why
How dare I
Walk where they 
Never thought to go
So they choose to ignore
I grin as they scurry 
Through thier lives
Trapped by their disbelief
That they do not control
Their very destiny
I try to speak
But they look at me
Like I am talking backwards
Erif ma I
You can see it 
In my eyes
If you dare to look
If you dare to believe"

"event","Sometimes I feel as if my life is a chess game I am playing at. I move things into place to start gaining an advantage, but sometimes I make a wrong move and it sets me back a bit. This seems all fine and ordinary, the only question is, who is it that sits across the board from me?"

"event","At some point I became the legend of my mind. Shaped my form to that which I wanted, and others saw it to be so. There are yet some kinks to work out, but for now they serve to amuse. Live on, live long, live free, the only thing you have to do is die. Everything else is choice. Steps in true love to throw a wrench in that theory. I tried to not love Lauren when I held no hope that she loved me in return, but to no avail. Which I am glad for. I rephrase, the only thing you have to do is die, everything else is choice, except if you are fortunate enough to find true love, in which case embrace it fully, for it will never let you bury it."

"event","its now 11:30pm, in another half an hour it will no longer be my bday, work was interesting, we had a system malfunction and our systems were down for nearly 3 and a half hours, so there was not much to do but sit around and apologize to customers. Before work, when i was walking to the bus stop, i thought, something is going to go wrong at work. Before that at around 2:30am my Lauren called all the way from Venice, Italy to wish me a happy bday, I completely forgot about all the things I wanted to tell her about, the raise I got at work, this journal I was working on, Daggerspell by Katherine Kerr she had let me borrow that I had finished and loved very much, and wanted to know if she had more of her books, and that she reminded me a lot of Jill, one of the main characters, but all I could manage to say was, I love you, and, I miss you, she told me somewhat of her trip, when I first looked at the caller id, when the phone rang it came up ""call unavailable"" I thought, ""lauren's calling!!"" but even after I heard her voice it took a few minutes for me to actually believe she was calling me from Venice to wish me happy bday, you see before she rang, I had just gotten up to get a glass of water, I like a bit of water after waking from dreams, I had been dreaming of Lauren, before I had gone to bed I had waiting up till midnight, Lauren had given me a bday card and made me promise not to read it till my bday, it was beautiful, nearly brought tears to my eyes, she is so amazing, just being her, and just being her, is greater then anyone I have ever known. Forwards or backwards, now or then, this instant, or forever, I always love her."

"event","So some might think by my last post that what is so hard to believe as that? So what a girl loves you. BAH! I say to you. And bah again. It is bloody amazing. She is bloody amazing. I know she will maintain that she is just being herself, but that just makes it greater. She always says things that make me happy. She can cheer me up whenever I am sad. She is pure fire. I love to stare into fires and watch the flames flicker, the colors dancing, the sparks sparkling. That is how I feel when I watch her. She is cool and calm if left to her dance, but try and mistreat her, and she will burn you so quickly and leave nothing but your ashes. I've never wanted a submissive woman, nor have I wanted a dominate woman, but one that was a mixture of both, a true companion, and that she is."

"event","When i was a kid i would make up stuff to impress my friends. I just wanted to be accepted. They did accept me, but I don't think they ever believed anything I told them. When I got older I stopped making stuff up, I decided that the important people will accept me for who I am. People still accept me, but I still think they don't believe the stories I tell, even though now they are true. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out the truth of this world and what it all means. Well, here is a story of truth, but as always you can beleive it or not, thats up to you. 

When I first met Lauren I was drawn to her. I couldn't stop watching her. She was standoffish, and had a habit of dissappearing towards the end of practice without a word. I can't remember why I emailed her the first time, something to do with fighting I suppose. We are a part of a live action medieval and rennesance sword fighting group. Anyways she emailed me right back. We emailed back and forth for awhile then I asked her if she had a instant messanger, so we started talking all night long. We stayed up late playing games, till my computer started acting up. Her and her friends tried to scare me off a couple times, but for some reason I was just drawn to Lauren like I hadn't been drawn to anyone else before. Normally, I can handle being social for a short while, but for the most part I like being alone, but for some reason I could not get enough time to spend with Lauren."

"event","for the first time ever I actually know that someone loves me, in the past i've dated girls that have been obsessed with me, this is not something I brag about, so please don't take it that way, it's really not that great, imagine being with someone that every word out of their mouth is how much they love you, but every action they take contradicts what they say, Lauren, my girlfriend, isn't like that, she actually backs up what she says, she accepts me for who I am, she doesn't drive me crazy, well the bad kind of crazy that is, and that's good, we've been together for five months now, three months according to when we started dating and her parents knew, which is great, we were friends for a year before that, she's the only person I ever want to talk to, and it irritates me to high hell when others try talking to me while i'm talking to her, for the first time i believe this is going to be a happy ending, instead of trying to convince myself its going to be a happy ending, i quess if you wish for something long enough, you just might get it"

"event","I growl for so many reasons, i growl when i am irritated, i growl when I fight, I growl when I am devishly happy, a growl can mean so many things, the main reason i started this journal is because my girlfriend is in europe for three weeks, she is my soul, I miss her badly, so I might talk about her alot here, most likely, i talk about her a lot period, she has the most beautifull hazel eyes, sometimes they look gold, sometimes green, often times grey, the left eye has a red fleck in it, she's smart very smart, she knows a lot about history, and philosophy, and she speaks other languages too, she tells me i'm smart as well, and in my way I am, but its hard to fit in some times, when i'm around her family, I know i don't need too, because she loves me so much. Well I just wanted to get this kicked off, and perhaps i will write more later. hmmmmmm spell check......bah!! i like typos, some i do on purpose."

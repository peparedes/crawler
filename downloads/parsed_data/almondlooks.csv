"event","1. Don't Look Back Into The Sun - The Libertines
I only got into The Libs this year and this song has made an appearence on every single mix CD I have made. I love love love it, and the intro gets me EVERY time.

2. France - Carl Barat
Because Carl's a poet too. OK Peter?

3. Razorlight - America
Just because it's a gorgeous song and I still haven't figured out if it makes me happy or sad.

4. Empire - Kasabian
I think this song was totally different to anything else this year, and it's fucking GREAT for a sleazy wee dance too.

5. Chelsea Dagger - The Fratellis
Anyone who hasn't heard this song is either been away for a long time, or deaf. And it has the catchiest intro of any song ever ever.

6. Deadwood - Dirty Pretty Things
Uft, everyone knows why. And also because it's just good, and I love the lyrics. HELLO bitchy Carlos.

7. Rehab - Amy Winehouse 
Best.female.artist.of the last 10 years. end of. And this song is fucking quality.

8. 8 Dead Boys - Babyshambles
Because it's hot as fuck. I can't be arsed with big rambly sentences ok.

9. Ribticklin - Drew McConnell
The words are.... worrying, the melody is gorgeous and the backing vocals are haunting.

10. Pornography - Client ft Carl Barat
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

11. Janie Jones - Babyshambles & co
It's the best ever to dance about to. And clearly, Drew in a police uniform is a marvel.

12. Over and Over - Hotchip
Laaaaaay back, laaaaaay back. Sleazy as hell. Love it.

13. Shoot the Runner - Kasabian
Because Tom Meighan saying ""she's my queen, bitch"" makes my stomach go funny.

14. Venus in Furs - The Velvet Underground
Envokes a similar reaction as number 10.

15. Lying is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off - Panic! At The Disco
The words are sleazy.as.fuck. And seeing it live transformed me from girl to woman. Or something similar. nff.

16. Tis A Pity She's A Whore - Kill City
Yes it is. Tis also a pity I didn't get into Kill City sooner.

17. I Get Along - The Libertines
FUCK EM. Love love love love love.

18. Everywhere - Yellowcard
It's a cover version yes, but it's better than the original and I adore it. The intro, the way it goes all manic, the violins. *shivers*

19. Loyalty Song - Babyshambles 
Possibly the most adorable song ever.

20. Dance Dance - Fall Out Boy
Because I learned the Pete Wentz dance, and also because it reminds me of someone. And us doing the Wentz dance haha."

"event","was not as good as it should have been. it started off great, then sharon left for her boyfriend which pissed me off. and we were sitting ALL night, hardly any dancing which also pissed me off. 

so then jenna and kerry left early to go to craigs, and since i wasnt going to sit in firewater alone, i left too a bit behind them. but then i lost them and they were at craigs already and since fit man i was with wasn't allowed to go i didn't fancy walking up myself in the dark. so i went to subway with fit man and friend and then fit man got in a fight. which was hot, but scary. he THREW a man through the window in subway. and some guy ran into me and i fell and now i have a swollen knee, 2 cut elbows, a cut finger and a bruised hip. and then fit man got blood ALL fucking down my leg.

but they got a taxi home with me and i pulled fit man and got his number which was joyous.


although, i am stopping drinking so much. when i think how much of a fucking dangerous situation i put myself in last night, it scares me. alone with 2 strange men who were fighing and me hardly being able to walk cos of my knee. although things turned out ok, it's just fucking stupid."

then we headed off to the sauchiehall and met emily of doom and stu and flo. and had a few drinks then sauntered on down to the buff club. grand.

music on all floors was excellent, especially on the ground floor where craig was DJ'ing. HE PLAYED I WISH! HE PLAYED I WIIIIIIIIIIIIISH! i died a wee bit. 

then it was a very drunken stumble up to the chippy for steak pie suppers. i could barely stand up because i am an alcoholic.

so yes, all in all a very very good night out. gutted about emily though, missed her man. 

kerry, hope you had a good birthday and as much fun as i think you did!!

Me and Jenna and Kerry got a photo with him and he was lovely. He looked terrified the whole time he met the fans and when he went ""nothing is working tonight"" I felt soo awfu for him.

BOAK is the word. BOAK i tell thee. then we went to costa and i got a bowl of coffee and a paninininini and a pure rank biscuit that was pretending to be nice. and emily laughed cos i wanted to drown a baby in my bowl of coffee. 

emily stole a nail polish. point and shout at the theif ladies and gents. i tried to steal a ring from topshop but i got AWFULY scared and chickened out for i am crap. 

also, me and emily are starting a farm. an exotic farm with penguins and giraffes and elephants. but also with cows and chickens. ahem.

ALSO, someone buy me the 30th anniversy rocky horror collectors box. i will actually suffer an early death if i don't own it. 

so peter got off with a fine eh? i don't know whether to be happy for him or disgraced at the justice system. i can't remember the posh word kerry uses instead of justice so justice will do fine. and to top it off, i doubt i can afford a ticket for the gig on sunday. *cries into the pillow*

but yeah, don't ever smoke 10 fags in half an hour. it kills. i wish the rain would actually just fuck off. it's pure depressing me to the point of never wanting to leave the house. i'm going to get my hair cut on thursday. gerriiiiin.

someone cheer me up? xx"

- tim curry in rocky horror picture show turns me on more than i care to admit.
- rocky horror is possibly the best musical ever.
- a clockwork orange is not what i imagined. but it's jolly good. i fancy alex.
- i need to find a healthy alternative to cheese and onion crisps. or i'll never lose weight ever.
- after typing out this entry, i reaslise i watch far too much tv.
- thinking about dpt on friday gives me goosebumps.
- someone fancy going to braehead tomorrow?
- i have brokeback mountain and blow to watch tonight. gay cowboys and johnny depp YES!

"event","gawsh that's such an english phrase. anyhoo, last night was FUCKING amazing. mini bar was grand in itself, i got pished as usual. and slut danced many a time with robert. fun for all the family.

then we went to ABC which was jolly good. it's seriousy the indiest club ever. LOVE IT. robert dancing to ""rock the casbah"" the way he did was too funny. so yeah fun fun fun as usual with jenna and kerry. <3 ye both. 

however, we got outside and got chippies, and kerry decided it would be the best idea ever to go on a massive detour. en route i saw superman, the guy i pulled at the halloween party. so i was talking to him and dax (his mate and a guy in my work) for a bit then we got clear of them. then later or on i turn around and superman is right beside us. hmm. anyhaa, me being the pissfaced whore that i am gave in and gave him my phone number. which y'know seemed like a good idea at the time, but he's texted me 9 times today. seriously, he needs to sod off. 

and then tonight i was out for dinner with le famile, and i ran into martin, the guy i used to fancy the arse off of. and my stomach flipped so much. and he gave me a big kiss in front of my dad (great idea martin) and he took my phone number (ahem.) but when i was trying to leave we almost pulled (though i realised my dad was watching) and now i can't stop thinking about him. and it's annoying, because i thought i got over him. 

last niggling point, i moan about my lack of <strike>sex</strike> male presence, but superman asked me to go over to his house, and i pure don't want to. and it's heavy daft.

fucks SAKE. i think about things too much."

"event","i don't know if i like ""i get along"" or ""don't look back into the sun"" better. it's terribly upsetting. at least i have narrowed it down to 2. 

also, i am really quite worryingly obsessed with carl barat. like, i thought nothing would out-do my nick out of rooster obsession, but hi@carl, ruiner of teenage lives. and unless you are worryingly obessed with someone too, (jenna, kim.) you don't get it. *woe* i like him even more than michael hutchence. and anyone who knows me well will testify, that's a whole lot of like!!

on the plus side, i get to see this thing of beauty play live in 2 weeks. TWO WEEKS! oh i am awfully excited. and if me and jenna don't meet him, i shall be ever so upset.

this is all."

"event","""I see the shadow""
by: Ivan G(unit)arza

Sometimes i cry at night alone
Fearing the worst, feeling the unknown
Talking myself outta everything i fear
But is it all worth it, is my life's end near?

Only one path of action stands in my way
All I need is just to gather up my faith
Know that the best thing is for me to end flight
I've done my best, and you no longer have fight

You sit there feeling that I've let you down
When I've endured the pain that most under it would have drowned
I've been stronger than all, and it's come to this end
My life is now over, I cannot pretend

Just one thing keeps me here
But if I am weak, it needs to end my fears
If I am down, it needs to hold me up
I cannot take charge for this last endere"

"event","During the past few days, a question has been emerged to myself. Why does Music mean so much to me? The only reason I can come up with is that, when I feel sad, or happy, or anything, I can always find a song to collaborate with my mood. Even with that said though, I am left with another similar question. Why don't I like the genre of Rap? Before today, I could easily say that I hated rap, that everything about it was bad and so forth. Today though, I believe I have dug deeper into myself to find out what I really meant. Rap is compromised of creating a ""poem"" so to say, and adding it to a rhythm. I myself am a song writer, so I know how hard it is to make words ""flow"" just right. I really believe that if everyone put their mind to it, they could create what I call a song, even more so if they had a certain type of strong feeling at the time they wrote the song. Maybe I have not been giving myself enough credit for songs that I have written? Maybe I am talented in some way, something that I have never had to strain to do as long as I can remember is put words together to explain my feelings. I can still remember when a rap or hip hop song would emerge, and it wasn't something that my parents would not let me listen to. That day is slowly starting to disappear. Although, for the most part, it isn't just rap. Every genre has it's bad moments so to say, and I really believe that those bad moments are what I don't really respect. What makes the people that wear baggy jeans and FUBU shirts so different from your average kid that skateboards and listens to rock? Not much, because they are both the extremes of their own genre. When I first started putting all of this into perspective for myself, I really thought it was just the genre of rap that I disliked, but I found myself wrong. While I have to admit, songs that repeat over and over about hoe this and hoe that, about shorty liking what's in my pants,can be catchy to the ear, it isn't something you will ever catch me spending my own money on. Perhaps being a musician has a big effect on what I call music. I know how to play almost every instrument you would see in a rock band, and I also know all of those instruments could be used to make the beats and rhythms of rap. When a band that uses instruments and raps comes out, I have that much more respect for that music. For the most part, I consider myself a very emotional person. So the type of music that I generally target makes me feel emotional. Emotional meaning strongly about a feeling...and not necessarily sad. So that brings up my conclusion. I don't hate rap. I just hate what MOST of it stands for."

"event","Well, my life has been pretty much topsy turvy from the time Olivia has gotten back until now. But I can honetly say that I have an idea on what being ""grown up"" is all about. While I don't have to worry about bills or payments or money probs yet, I do have to worry about worrying about them later...sorry if that was hard to understand. The good thing is that with Olivia comming home for good, we have more time to plan for our wedding. I won't lie, I was happy when our plans entitled us to get married in May, but I also knew it was gonna be a rushed wedding. Now, we will be able to get married the way we want to. I still believe that I will end up going for a career as a LVN or a police officer. I happen to have an uncle in the SAPD, so I'll get as much info as I can from him. Right now, the only thing that is bothering me is that I don't really want to be at home anymore. I am always bored here, and I am starting to feel horrible about living off of my mom. Most would say for me to take advantage of this ""free"" living until I get a good amount of money under my name. I think that is gonna be the way I do it though. Hopefully, if all goes well, I'll have my own transportation, and a decent apartment in Uvalde before the fall of this year. I can then see about enrolling into the criminal justice program that the school offers, and be ready to move to San Antonio in a few years. I can't wait to live the ""married life"" with Olivia. I know it is gonna be so great waking up every morning to her beautiful face and body, right there by my side. If all goes well, I would probably enroll into the LVN program instead of the criminal justice, but in order to do that, I need to find a good paying steady job. Maybe what I should do is look for work in Uvalde so that I know what is offered. Either way, I am going to do everything in my power to get myself ready for Olivia as soon as I can. I can't explain why, but I would much rather be a couple living together and going to school, rather than waiting for me to get out of school then get married. I feel that waking up to her every morning, and knowing she will be there for me at night will encourage me to do what I have to do more than just doing it to get married. Either way, I still can't wait till it happens. I know that if we both put or minds on what we want, we can get it. I just hope some of it will pass smoothly.

~For you my love~
For you my love, I will do everything that I can.
For you my love, Our future I will try and plan.
For you my love, I will press forward with all my might.
For you my love, My heart will never stop to fight.

Olivia, for you my love, I will do anything and everything in order to give us a great life together. As far as I am concerned, nothing will be to great of a feat for me to overcome, as long as I know you are there backing me up, and supporting me. With the knowledge of us one day living together and being married, I will try my hardest to make things easy for us. Most likely, it will still be a little rough, but our marriage will only be stronger because of that. 

For you my love, I will let my heart lead me forward.

"event","Today my friends I had a wonderful day with my one true love.  Yeah I know I talk about her alot, but I can't help it I love her alot, and she loves me the same.  Oh by the way Olivia thinks I'm too sexy.  We had alot to talk about, especially about our future together.  It's gonna be a little hard trying to go to school and see each other, but we are still gonna love and see each other as much as we can.  We both know it's gonna work out.

Ok friends, I'm back now!!!! (Ivan)

My life is really gonna be changing soon. As soon as I can get established with a good paying job and be able to support myself through school and an apartment, I hope the time will come closer for Olivia and I's marriage date. I'm usually not the type of person that like to rush things, but I don't feel like I am rushing this. One thing that is for sure is that I do want to be able to afford my plans. We've come up with a few plans, which include buying furniture and other things we will have as a couple starting as soon as we have money coming in. This was, we can keep all this in storage and when we do get our first place, we can move into a place....and not sleep on the floor. HEHE!!! WOW! Our own place!! That sounds so awesome. I can't wait till the day comes when I can wake up next to Olivia, in our own house, without the fear of my mom or a cousin or a roommate walking in during....uhm, yeah. 

~Ivan~ and ~Olivia~"

"event","HEHE Sorry Eric for accidently posting this also on your replies...!!!

Well, things didn't turn out exactly like I had planned with Olivia being back. Don't get me wrong, Her being close is so good. I love the fact that I can just drive for a few minutes and get to spend time with her. Being able to talk to her on the phone is great also. I love her to death, but I sense that something is missing. Something that I don't even know what it is. Being here in this shit ass town really isn't helping to much. I feel....depressed. It's a feeling that I really don't want to feel. Not now, not with Olivia just getting here!! But it's something that I can't understand. I know it isn't something brought upon because of a person or anything of that sort. But there are honestly times that I want to hit the nearest object (usually a wall) as hard as I can. My knuckles don't like me very much at this moment, but I must say, it relieves more pain then it creates. Hopefully my mom or Roy will show up soon and relieve me from working here at the store. I think I need to see Olivia, she always seems to have a way to make me feel better. I just wish I didn't feel this way.

On the other hand, Last night was one of the greatest nights in my life. The moment I saw Olivia walking down the exit ramp at the airport was something that I am going to remember forever. But at the same time, I don't expect everything to be up to date with us for a while. 30 days is a long time to catch up with. I wanna know everything that she has gone through. I guess the fact that she is back home, and I am here at my home is making it a bit hard. Seeing her almost every day was something that I depended on. Her making my life complete. Well, I guess this is a good enough sized entry for not having made one in a while. 

The correctional officer thing looks promissing. But I don't know how long it will be before I get my own place. I need out of this town.

"event","Hello to all of you that still keep up with my journal. As most of you know by now, Olivia left for basic training on Dec. 28th. From then to now has been so hard and the time has gone by so slow. But it turns out that Olivia will not be in the Army for long! She doesn't want to be in it anymore, and would rather return to yours truly!!! While at first I was upset because I didn't want to be the reason she returned, incase she regreted it later, I am happy with the turnout. I never really wanted her to leave in the first place, but bit my tongue a few hundred times. It turns out that it wasn't what she expected of the Army, and that she wants nothing of it. Also, she got sick and may be put out on a medical discharge, which is a good way to leave the Army!! Anyways, thanks for all my friends that have supported me through this time away from the other half of my soul. I will soon be united with her again!

Ivan"

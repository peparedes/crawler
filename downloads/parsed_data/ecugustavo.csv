I really like it, it's silver and it's all mine! heh  My payments are like really reasonable and it's well worth it, so i'm all excited today.  It's funny b/c Jason just got a new car too, and they're almost identical, so we get to compare in good ways and not be jealous and stuff.  I'm going to the beach tomorrow to see some family...I have to go there to pick up some of my stuff from home anyways that they brough for me.  I had to work a double yesterday so i'm really tired, but hopefully i'll just be able to make it through tonight.  As Tonka said, and I really did prove this to myself today, ""I dun changed over a new leaf"".   hehe"

"event","Well in case you didn't know, I threw out my back on Monday night. On Tuesday night I went to the ER, and I had a sprained back. I had alot of meds that night and I was put on three prescriptions. It was ok though b/c I had to take three days off of work, and tonight will be my first night back since the injury. Jason was absolutely wonderful...he took care of me with anything and everything I needed, and really put up with me being cranky too. The meds made my mood really unpredictable, and he just put up with it and was wonderful about it. My back still is sore, but much much better.  Just wanted to let everyone know that I was ok.  I'm going tomorrow to hopefully get a new car (a Nissan Altima hopefully).  I just don't know how the insurance and stuff is gonna work, but we shall soon see!!  *crosses fingers*"

He wasn't honest with me and that's not acceptable. SO, that little venture is done. Oh well.  I got the new Goo Goo Dolls CD, it's a 22 track compilation off of all 6 of their cd's, with songs that weren't so popular. It's really good and i'm so excited that it's finally out!!  I went to La Vista's tonight to get some pizza and a drink, and I ended up having a few jello shots. lol I got a little tipsy I guess you could say, but i'm all good now.

Last weekend this guy in Greensboro IM'd me. Like all usual IM's from peeps I don't know, i blew him off. He was persistent though in a good way, not just wanting sex or the like. So we started talking, and actually got along. After a couple of phone calls and talking online for 6 hours at a time we decide to meet, so he makes the three hour drive last night to come to Greenville. I was working a 3-11 at the hotel and DAMN was I nervous. hehe  He arrived at about 10 and my god what a gorgeous gorgeous guy. He looked like he belonged in a GAP commercial or on Dawson's Creek, as my coworker Christina said. lol  We had a great night, walking through campus in the rain and watching Dogma.  I already knew I really liked his personality at this point, so with him being beautiful just added fuel to the fire. lol  I do not go into details, but I will say that somebody's in trouble b/c I have a hickey on my neck. heh  Things aren't official..yet, but I anticipate them being so fairly soon. The distance will bother me, but for somebody to sweep me off of my feet what's three measly hours?"

I'm in the process of moving, and though it's only down the street, it's still very expensive and very time consuming. There's so much to do and so little time to do it. I have 3 days left in my first apartment, and i'm sure going to miss it. I had so many good memories here, but oh well...life goes on.  I'm learning how to drive stick shift also at the moment. It's okay sometimes, but I have a hard time backing up and getting started. I'm borrowing a friends 5 speed so I can practice some, b/c I'm getting a new car in June and mom wants me to get a five speed. We shall see, but right now if I could just get it started every time I'd prefer a five speed for sure.  Saturday is my birthday, I turn 21. YES, I'm going to get fucked up. lol  I can't wait really.  Next week, while i'm in between apartments (i don't move into my new place until the following friday) i'm going to be staying with my aunt who lives in goldsboro. It's only like a 45 min drive to work, and I grew up there so it will be fun. Well kids I'm off to bed now, there's nothing more to say. Keep in touch guys! :)"

Sometimes people just wonder b/c they may have had plans or something to that effect, but it's not always about trust.  My pretty boy did come over, we just had a good heart to heart and things are left on terms of things being thought about, which i'm happy with. I just want a decision that's genuine, meaning both peoples' sides are heard and if he can't see that i'm genuine and if he doesnn't trust that i can fix those little things that were wrong, then that's not the boy that I grew to care for so much.

I'm posting this for everybody to see, and maybe the person who this is addressed to will listen to every word I have to say and try to salvage something special.  Back in December I met somebody who completely swept me off of my feet, and I know I did the same for him. Ever since then we have become closer and closer, on many levels. I like everything about him, from the smell of strawberries n Phil to the dot on his lip to being another Pikachu and Luna.  Last Saturday a part of that ended when he broke up with me, for reasons which he might have been right about.  I'm not upset due to the fact that I totally turned my life around to date him, i'm just upset b/c I think that things were ended too abruptly.  I found out something on Sunday for the first time, without a chance to work on or correct it. I want Phil to know that I trust him with all my heart, and I believe deep down he knows that's true. Now, I want to prove that to him.  I'm making this offer in front of everybody, to show how much I care. We have plans tonight to watch Survivor, just like every Thursday night. I want another chance at this, I know that Phil would be happy with me and I would treat him great, I always did. The things that bugged him I will and have been working on, and if I mean it to him he will show up here tonight by 8pm, to open up to me so we can talk things out. I don't want any phone calls, any online conversations, I just want to wait here and see if he shows up or not. I know that he has nothing else to do b/c we already have plans together, so it's just a matter of if he wants this or not.  I want to prove to him that he's trusted, and he can't deny that smile on his face he always got.  I will be waiting here, and if he shows up I know that he trusts me to konw that i'm honest and sincere about this, and if not then maybe he's just not ready but I trust that I will see my pretty boy by 8pm. I will post later tonight to let you guys know what happened."

An old coworker from the Ramada stopped by, and ended up staying until almost 5:30, so the night went by pretty quickly.  I got to go home a little bit early because the guy that hired me works first shift and he didn't really have anything else for me to do, he had to come down early to make sure I did everything right (which I did) so I could go home at like 6:30 this morning, lucky me!  I also found out that I wasn't stood up by my friend Jeremy, he just had some drama with his ex boyfriend who cheated on him so he ended up going and staying with a friend, which is totally understandable.

I am scared to talk to him, he yells alot lately and gets kinda bitchy because I want to know what's going on. He says it's in my hands but it's not. He needs to come to me, and show me what I mean. He needs to confide in me and trust me the way that he used to. I can look past the fact that I'm still deeply in love with him, because the friendship was always of upmost importance to me, and it still is.

It's out of my hands, I've done nothing wrong and this situation can easily be fixed, it's just up to that person whether they want to or not.  now i'm going to attempt something called sleep."

"event","today is officially one month, and it's weird b/c today was the day that the apartment became really *mine*.  All of my old roommates furniture and shit is gone, so it's all Jon.  It seems that at the one month marker things really became official, i guess it was a trial period or something. lol  I had a rough night last night, hardly sleeping a wink. I'm worried about all my bills and what not, and thank god I got this new job or else I'd be having panic attacks 24/7.  Tonight i'm just gonna try to not worry about anything and have a good time.  i've been busy cleaning and decorating all day and I deserve a fun night out for sure.  I still have alot of work to do, but it's coming along nicely!"

"event","Wow, I am sooo unbelievable proud of myself. I was out of work for a total of 18 hours. I got hired today at the Howard Johnson, full time audit position Sunday-Thursday nights.  I still get my club nights and I start actually on Sunday, which is awesome. I made it. The odds were stacked agains me and I beat them. I could've taken the easy road out, but that would not be being true to myself or my heart. I decided to go for what I had, to follow my heart and take the chance. It was worth it. It would've been worth it either way. I'm so happy with my life right now, and I think this was a test. It was a test to see how serious I was with what I have and how much I care. I passed the test, and I'm so proud of myself. OH, and another thing, one of my best friends Tonka from the Ramada just got hired there too, so I will be working with her once again. :)  Nothing can stop me now, nothing can stop us now."

I called this place called On-line, which is right near where I live, and they're looking for a telephone collection-agent, which is basically somebody who calls you when you don't make your car payments and stuff, and we threaten you, etc.  It's got a base salary but also commissions on your collections, and they like the experience that I have so hopefully this will work out.  The guy is going to call me back here really soon, so all of you who have faith in me maybe i won't let you down after all. Cross your fingers!!

After getting fired, I went to BW3 and my friend Jimmie was there, along with my ex Jason and my boyfriend. All of them were there for me, and so was Cliff (my upstairs neighbor). I think that I will be OK, i'm a very strong person and I know that I can make it!  I'm just so mad, b/c this was so out of the blue and unexpected, and I feel like i've done a really good job there, I've even had 2 promotions in the past month. Oh well, speaking of months late tonight/early tomorrow morning it will be one month officially. A big part of me can't believe that we've made it this far, but the first month is always the toughest, and we have been through one really big tester, so it looks like smooth sailing from here, and it's all good.  And today I'm just gonna stay up and get out early looking for a job so that I can take good care of myself and my kitty, and get ready for survivor night. I really hope that Alicia is gonna be okay, but I ahve a bad feeling that she's the one that gets hurt.  I guess we'll see tonight. Anybody out there, wish me luck and stuff, I have confidence in myself but this is SO hard and scary!!"

As I wrote earlier I was worried about the night dragging ass really bad because I got done so early, but that just totally made my night. They were in the area, going to wal mart to pick up sugar and caffeine for all-nighters they had to pull for art projects.  I like little surprises like that, most people just can't comprehend how much I value that.  Right now I only have less than 2 hours of work left, then I get to go home and go to bed!!! :)  I'm gonna sleep so good today, b/c it's kind of cold outside and it's gonna be rainy (hopefully).

This will be the second time I went to Perkin's today, earlier I had some strawberry pancakes with Phil and Elena. Wehn I was there earlier though I was *not* in a good mood at all. I'm feeling better now though, I got to see alot of friends today that I havent' seen in a while (Rachel, Athena, Linzi) and got to meet some new people, which I'm always up for.  Now hopefully the night won't drag ass too bad. lol  And I found out that I get my new furniture on Thursday, so i'm really looking forward to that.

Me and her are on really good terms now, which pleases me. I hung out with Leigh-chan for a little while today, and she has the greatest game for Dreamcast, called ""Crazy Taxi"".  It's so awesome, you get to drive like a maniac to get people to their stops and stuff, and it's measured on how much cab fare you earn.  What an awesome and original idea!! I then got to go to wendy's and even though they didn't have my baked potato *snarl* it was still good. I got to see the people closest to me today and that has put me in a really good mood. I'm at work now but it's just like I'm not worried about anything! :)  And I don't know what's up with my music taste right now, but hey, these guys are good, I must admit.

I got a new computer today, so this is my first official entry on that.

I was within an eyelash of leaving, or being kicked out it, it seemed.  Now after talking rationally (which is more my style) things seem to be looking up.  I'm very lucky, more lucky that I tend to think I am at times. I have great people in my life, those who truly care about me. I'm excited about going to the club tonight and seeing a friend perform, and I'm making a promise to myself to not start ANY drama or tension, my friends don't deserve that!  Well, I have to start getting ready for the club, and as a friend told me, even though this has been a week from hell a new week starts very soon, and this will all be over.  thank god, it seems that we've made it.  any other challenges, greenville?"

Today is survivor day, it's the one date I know I will have every week, and hence I look forward to it!  Tonight is also amateur night at the club, it will be my first one so it should be interesting. A dear friend of mine is having some problems with some emotions right now, and I'm having trouble knowing where to draw the ""helping"" line. Like I have to know when he says ""no, i'm ok"" and means it and when he says that and really means ""please come help me"".  I'm just going to do my best to make sure he's okay, that's all I can do.  I was also told that if I played a certain artist that I would get a comment on my journal entry, ummmmmmm.....brb.

Since I have made the committment of joining livejournal.com, I guess I must fulfill my part of the bargain. I'm very very scared about a dinner that's supposed to take place later today, and I heard a certain angel say with my own two ears that he knew for sure that my boyfriend didn't really care for me. Not that I believe him, b/c I trust my boyfriend 100%, it's just that that upsets me. I hear alot about the angel, when will he realize the angel is not a true friend? Maybe that just doesn't matter though. I do know that i'm going to live up to all my promises I made, and i'm not going to let anybody take away the teddy bear that means so much to me, the same one that makes getting up in the morning so much easier.

Leigh-chan got me to join, and also one of my best friends is a member, so i'm a member of the club now. :)  I had a great night tonight, I watched survivor like every thursday night (and damn Kucha is kicking ass) and then walked downtown before going to work, which is where I am right now. Lately life has been so good to me, and it's awesome being able to go to bed excited for the next day to come. It shows how i've changed as a person, for to truly be happy one must be happy with themselves.  Now that I have that, it's the greatest thing. Also, I'd like to say that I got the best Valentine's Day gift imaginable. It came straight from the heart and when I received it it almost made me cry. It was so beautiful, and to the person who sent it, you know who you are, thank you so much. Well, i'm out to go to actual work. Going from hardly working to working hard.

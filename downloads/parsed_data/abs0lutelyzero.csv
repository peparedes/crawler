That way, if it's not going well, the ones who are 21 (namely, me) can drown their sorrows in cheap beer. We were going to wait and do it after some of our friends get home from MSU, but...now, there's no guarantee that we'll be able to. Which is sad.

Last night, I had a dream that the Wings played a team made entirely of clones of Shane Doan. There were, like, 8 of them on the ice at one time, and the refs weren't calling too many men. It was horrible."

There were only like...four people there in front of me, so I scurry up and stand in line. When I got up to them, I was pretty nervous, because I was starstruck I guess. We had this thrilling conversation.

Me: Hi, can I get a picture?
Brett: Yeah, of course! Wait, do you want to be in it?
Me: YEAH.

So I hand my camera to some random lady and she takes this gem:

They were both like ""Oh, take your time"" and ""don't be nervous!"" which just made things <i>worse</i>. And I remembered at the last minute to tell Justin that my bff goes to State and was really jealous that she didn't get to come meet him, and he told me to tell her hi.

"event","So, I&nbsp;don't understand <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/30923510.html"">this story</a> at all. Some guy SHOT another guy for talking during The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.&nbsp;I&nbsp;saw that movie last night, and truth be told, if I was going to shoot anyone during that movie, it would've been myself. Who thought making a 3 hour movie out of a 7 page short story was a good idea?&nbsp;It was such a snoozefest. And no, haters, I&nbsp;didn't &quot;not get it.&quot;&nbsp;I&nbsp;got it. I&nbsp;just thought it was really long and drawn out.&nbsp;If it had been 90 minutes...it&nbsp; would have been awesome. But not three hours.<br /><br />I&nbsp;lost my paycheck last night. I&nbsp;fail at life."

Best feeling ever, y/y?"

"event","Twilight was so awesome. I&nbsp;saw it with Brittany last week and it killed me. It was so cheesy and for some reason reminded me of a bad 80s teen horror movie, which means I&nbsp;loved every minute of it. Even better?&nbsp;<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/m15m/19551.html#cutid2"">Twilight in 15 Minutes</a>.<br /><br />Right now I'm reading the book&nbsp;<u>The Road</u> for one of my literature classes, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;loooove it. It's so dark and disturbing and it makes you feel like shit once you put it down (but right now I'm only halfway through it). I wish I was that good at writing, but...not yet. Some day. <br />I&nbsp;pretty much want to read every book ever written.<br /><br />10+ page research paper due Weds.<br />Zero&nbsp;pages done."

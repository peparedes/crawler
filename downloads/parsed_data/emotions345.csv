"event","These past couple of days have been taking me for a spin. I have had to just let everything out. I am thankful for 3 of my bestfriends in the whole wide world- Jasmin, Tia and Darius!!! Without you all I would be messed up and still ""down and out."" Thursday night I had a mini breakdown, then Friday I just let lose and had to let it all out. I have in a since become closer with God and I have become open with myself, which is a major accomplishment. Now all I need to do is work on my communication skills with everyone, esp my parents and a guy friend. But through it all I am now somewhat stable. (Well except for when tom comes and I have to wear this ugly suit that my mom bought me even though I still hate wearing it.)

 All in all I am fine and I must also give thanks to one more great friend: GOD! I thank him for life, health, strength, friends-relationships (no matter how much I despise some of them)and family. (I guess even school.) These things challenge me everyday and I must learn how to organize all of them and give a little time of my days to each of them. God is teaching me that I must organize and manage all of my time to the best of my ability and I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. So to everyone cheerup if you are down and take this journal entry as an inspiration.

TO ALL MY GIRLS: Stop worrying about guys. Become focused and look/feel comfortable with yourself because sooner or later that guy will come around and find you.

TO ALL MY GUYS: Focus on school stuff and important stuff first. Like In Kanye West's song ""get your sh** together"" first before you go mess with some girl. Don't play them or say anything stupid. Be yourself, don't cheat and have fun. (TRY TO STICK TO ONE!)

Well I love you all,
Write me sometime soon! O and get that summer reading out of the way.

   My day started out o.k. I woke up on my own @ 5:15a.m. (That scares me.) I slept from 7 something yesterday till this morning at 5:15 a.m. I didn't even talk till 2:00 in the morning again. DARN! I can say that I can completed rested up. Only problem is that I am EXTREMELY HUNGRY! The guy that usually gets my food forgot about me for the 2nd day in a row!!!! I guess that is good because I can save my own money. BUT I AM HUNGRY! I have a rice krispy treat, but it is not holding me over.
   I have been talkin to someone over the weekend. We have a couple of problems which we have to overcome- nothing major at all- infact they are fun problems I look forward to exploring! Anyways, I hope everyone else gets to eat- cus I won't! 
I got remember that atleast I am still alive and not to be mad at the guy or my growling stomach. Though I will be here later since I got here late (8:30). Anyways, 

I Love you all!

P.S. For those of you who are having bad days with rain think happy thoughts! I know I am! XOXOXO~"

"event","Like my subject says: This week has sucked! Man I am so mad that I have a whole-nother yr b/f I graduate! I need to get the get out of this town!!!!!!! Everything has sucked except for my GGT scores (they sucked but not as much). All I want right now is either straight peace and quiet or some fun folks who go out somewhere with me and do nothing but straight stupid stuff!
   This afternoon, I took the Clorox from the top shelf in the laundry room and placed it on top of the washer machine. I put light clothes in and began to let them wash. I decided to go put some food in my body, cus I can't starve all day. While I was eating, I heard a thud, but I thought nothing of it. I said I would get it later. Later came after about 10 mins. I went into the laundry room and saw clorox all over the floor and on many of my families clothes.  I just cried cus I already had a horrible morning as it was: stuck with the kids who aren't cleaning up anything, but instead ruining everything w/o cleaning up their messes. Plus my ""Visions"" plans were ruined when I was told by my dad that he and mommy wanted to go out on a date to Houston's. So I was just like, my day is kilt! Whew-hew! This makes me even madder/sadder, b/c all week I have been looking forward to getting out of this hell hole and going somewhere. But whatever I am stuck here. I didn't feel good b/f the Clorox spill and I don't feel any better now.

P.S. I wonder what my mother will say?- I don't care. If I look at it on the bright side, maybe we can go shopping for new clothes tonight? W/e! I messed up my 2 fav. pairs of pants anyway. O and sorry Chanee for Visions, I really wanted to be there!"

"event","The prom was a success and I actually had fun. I didn't really dance, except to Betcha can't get like me- and I only danced a fake dance to that for about 3x, which meka took a pic of. 
   Prom overview for me: Mila's pic party, Dailey's restaurant(we were an hr late- an all I ate was cheesecake w/ pineapples and a bit of liquor), prom, then we were supposed to go to a westlake after party (cus the other nahs party was cancelled- like we were really gonna go to it). I hope that those of u who decided to go to Whitney's after party are happy about ur decisions. (Let's hope that no addictions occur in the future.) Then we followed Chris every which way down Peachtree, finally arriving at Steak n' Shake. Steve took us (Jas, Tia, Sam and I) back to the hotel- Residence Inn.We woke up and I had 2 cups of Oreos and creme icecream, then we went out for brunch @ Roasters Rotisserie. - Just as good a Picadilly's, except probably more sanitary.
   I'm sorry for those who night wasn't that great. I hope that in the future (next yr) things will go better. All in all, I must say that I had fun, but I am sleepy.

(My mood is so true. I am so scared cus I did something I never thought I would do.- no drugs, sex, etc.)

Love u guys!!"

   At church, in sunday school they told me that i need to preserve certain times in my life in a memorial. I said that I use the internet- mainly cus I am (or atleast I used to) always be on it. (Writing annoys me.) Anyways, I guess I like this livejournal thing. 
   Now I am gonna start talkin about stuff that ppl actually wanna hear about:
 I'M PREGNANT!!!!! You wanna know who that baby daddy is?? 


For those of u who know me, u know that I am not willing to do anything of that sort. Just wanted to livin up my journal. Are you sad that this is the last day of this wonderful cool breezy break?? That sucks!

G2g though,

Love, peace and happiness!

"event","I don't know how I am feeling now. I guess you could say that I am bored. Ummm.. WEll I finally got to read u guys previous livejournals, well that is up to Chanee's realization story. That is as far as I think that I will go for now. (This is all like one big soap opera.) I'm sorry, but I am also happy for you Ms. Jackson. But like everyone keeps telling you things will get better in the future. Most of us are single, which hey if your like me, you won't look at your singleness as being a bad thing. The single life has its ups and downs, but for the most part I am doing good.

My only set back right now is PROM!! DO I HAVE TO GO?? I am dreading it. Maybe you guys can see it from my point of view:

The Prom (with that music from my sweet 16):
 When I first come in there will be people sitting and dancing. Girls will be hopelessly in love with this one guy for only ONE NIGHT. Most girls feet will hurting all night long. Ms. Krigger wil driving those in the prom committee and our little 10th grade helpers crazy. Somebody's gonna get hurt- physically and emotionally. I feel especially sorry for the emotional, cus its gonna take them a little while to get over whatever problem has just occurred. Girls hair, which they just spent $50,$60, $75, $100 or more on is gonna get messed up. People are gonna try to find someplace to go afterwards and get DRUNK- hopefully no one gets hurt or does something completely stupid that I know of (but that's bound to happen. For the most part it will be a night where you look pretty for a moment only to take it all back down or dance it out w/i 3-6 hrs.

But whatever, I don't want to discourage anyone from going, this is just my opinion. O and I promise that it will look nice. I am on the prom committee and what we- well I don't really think that I did much- but what they have planned for you will look nice!

Well I am gonna head out, I have a birthday party to oversee for Crystal (sister).
O and by the way my birthday is coming up on Wednesday -April 13th. But don't worry about gettin anything- all I want is a hug and to know that you all still (if you ever did) love me!! 

Love, Peace and Happiness

Umm, u said that you get along best with Capricorns, Taurus, etc. and that u and Aries wouldn't get along.

O, but wait, I have something very impo to say. It is something that angers me very much. Why is it that folks won'd stop trippin on a certain person because of the way they look? The way they look shouldn't matter, just as long as that person feels good. (Well if they are like totally unkept, then yeah there is a problem, but if it is minor, such as bagginess or colors, then leave them alone.) What I can't understand is how my good friends can't seem to stop caring about what I wear?? Who cares right?? Atleast I match most of the time!! MAN I went to school to see the play tonight, and everyone was like all dressed up in their attire. Most of them looked like they went shopping at Lenox or somewhere. Must we all fall into this madness that the media has created for us?? IT IS STUPID!!!!! What is this: I gotta look pretty everyday ish, no matter how I feel?? If someone wants to dress a certain way, well gosh darnit, let it be. You aren't them. Let the ish go and go on with ur life!! Thank u that is all!!"

"event","Hey all,

   Keerror this should make you happy. I finally wrote a journal. (Well actually, I write journals, but many of them I write in private about what's goin on in my life once or twice a week.) Hey you guys how do you set up different pics on the side. I want pics!!!!!! 

   Well what's been goin on in my life??? O I got a new permit. (For those of you who didn't know I had lost my wallet 2 weeks ago.) Its the same pic. Well right now I am at the Central library and I only have 5mins left. So to reply to what i have read on everyone else's previous livejournals: 

Makkah- I know I am about a week late, but thank you so much for your words of encouragement. They really helped to uplift my day. I hope that thinks stay better in your life.

Chanee- Don't stress over no boy. In due time things will look up for you in the relationship basis.
Stay happy while you can. I read ur note and it made me feel like I have the world to live for.

Darius- I am glad that your day was great yesterday. Better days are still to come!!

Jamila- I hope that u actually start saying something in response or for your own benefit to these livejournals. (You can't be like me and only have it to read others stuff. J/K!)

Kerror- I hope you are happy I finally am responding to ur complaining. 

G2g times up!"

   You guys are so good at updating so often. Couldn't be me. If you had to ask me how I am doing right now, I think that I am doing fine. I feel like breakin out and singing just the 1st line of the song ""ALL BY MYSELF"", and leaving it at that. Because I am o.k with that. Anyways, right now I could really go for something different and new in my life. It doesn't have to be a guy. It could be a new passion- for homework or some art form. Like my subject says, I am craving for (to the rhythm of ""Chain, Chain, Chain"") CHAIN CHAIN CHANGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well I gotta go,

I am just happy that it is over. I don't want to bring any of my baggage over to this week. I don't need it!
   I don't understand, why can't we all just get along? Why do we have to keep so many secrets from each other? and why can't we all just.... I don't know. I no longer care. If you need me this week, I am here, but first just ask me am I ok.

I'm Kayla. I died when I was two, and since then, no one has liked me or asked to play any macaroni games. 

""Fo Shizz"". 

Actually, I'm 11, and going into the 6th grade. If it isn't plain to see, I love Albedo (as mal says: ""That one crazy mofo from Xenosaga who just won't DIE""). I like video games and anime/manga, such as Kodocha and Kaleido Star. I'm also a big fan of Saiyuki.

This is my first roleplay experience, so please don't be too harsh on me!"

"event","True Story. A religion teacher assigned her class an essay on what makes a good Christian. One student wrote about talking to God and allowing people to enjoy their lives, and supporting gay marriage. The day the teacher was to hand the papers back, she called up the student and told him she would pray for him when he went to hell. The student asked why would he be going to hell, and why he got an F on his paper. The teacher told him that Catholicism is against gay marriage. The student looked at her for a minute, then said aloud, ""I'm gay."" The teacher kicked him out of class as if he had said 'fuck' or admitted to worshipping Satan. A girl in the back of class who had a boyfriend and was obviously straight got up and left too. 

If you would leave the classroom, repost this. It doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, or gay. It doesn't matter if you're Catholic or not. Everyone is a human being and deserves happiness."

Me: *spots road kill on the road* GASP! ROAD KILL!
""Road Kill"": *gets up and leaves*
::Cricket noises::
Me: ... Or not...

We also saw another road kill that was dead. It was a deer. I saw one chipmunk and no squirrels.Wait one squirrel. Then when we took a walk and there was a huge spider I almost ran the rest of the way home. I caught two lighting bugs and the came back to attack me. Jere stayed at the so he saw nothing. We never went swimming and we never went through a hike through the woods.Well we had ice cream every night. That was pretty much our hole week. I was so glad to get home.
      Last but not least I am going to my moms because she is going to Wisconsin with some friends and I won't have anything to do. She is quiting her job and working somewhere else in about a week. So I am going to my home on a couple of days in the week."

"event","I have nothing to do. This is still new to me so..... I still wish Mal could make me a layout but the CD is nowhere to be found. I go to my grandmothers tomorrow at 9:00 am. We are staying at her house for one night and then on Sunday we go to Galena. I did all my chores but I have nothing to do. So bored. Although my dad should get home soon enough."

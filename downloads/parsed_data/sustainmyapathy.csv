"event","Sitting here, in front of my computer, I cannot believe that twelve hours ago I was singing the chorus for 'Suffer Well' along with thousands that tore their throats and lungs out in order to keep up with Dave Gahan's crescendos in that song.

Simply put.

Yesterday was the best night of my entire life.

I do not even know where to begin. The concert was held at a stadium that once served as a Baseball Stadium. Our tickets were not so good, considering we were in the second section of the General Admittance(GA) area, but the first section sold out in minutes. Above, to the sides, there were numbered tiers, but these were too far from the stage. Anyway. Seeing how this was GA, we decided to get there about 5, considering the concert was scheduled for 8:30. Contrary to what I had first believed, our section had very few people in it. So, over all, we got good places. It was incredibly disheartening to see a lot of free space in the GA section before us. It would have made a significant difference to be there, as opposed to where we were.

Hours slowly ticked by, in which I gave myself the chore of keeping myself hydrated. That is the thing about massive concerts-- the bouncing, the singing; all of it tends to give you a rather interesting exercising, and in return makes you sweaty. Then, everyone's worst fear became true-- rain. Thankfully, some people were selling plastic ponchos at really low prices. Granted, these weren't the best of couture, but they did the trick. It was a slight breeze and sooner than we imagined, it was gone. There was a group of Northern people next to us, saying a lot of nonsense that I found strangely amusing, for some reason. They dubbed themselves as a superhero/Jedi/cult group with the capes they bought, so they kept saying all this weird stuff and making bizarre sounds. I stuck to my reduced entourage with Ed and my sister, prodding fun here and there. We managed to sit for lapses, which made us save up our energies for the concert. But at 8:00 we decided it was time to get up.

The opening act, 'She Wants Revenge', came up to the stage at 8:20. A pleasant surprise, because I thought they would come up at 8:30. I LOL'ed as the couple behind me thought SWR was The Strokes O_o; Okay. How can you mistake those two?! I gave Ed a covert snicker which he returned with a more significant chuckle and we returned our eyes to the stage shortly after. SWR sang 5 songs, if I am not mistaken. Possibly 6. Of course. As soon as the lead singer decides to start bonding with his Mexican crowd, a lot of whistles and obscenities were retorted. Personally, I liked this group. I had only heard 'Tear You Apart', but I think they have a nice sound. 

She Wants Revenge left the stage at 8:45, and technicians came to change the instruments. This was my first chance to glimpse at the props Depeche Mode carried. Martin Gore's keyboard were silver-shaped cylinders. I can't remember well... but I believe Andy Fletcher's were as well. Anyway. Lights everywhere, on top, at right and left. Majorly red. There were two huge screen at either sides, in which you could see collages of images of on-stage action and characteristic DM images.

By 9:20, lights went out and it finally started. Opening song was 'A Pain That I'm Used To'. I think it would have been better if they had opened with 'Black Celebration', but it has been ages since Depeche Mode sings that in their concerts. It was followed by 'A Question Of Time', in which we got to see the <i>true</i> Dave Gahan with his sinuous body movements take a hold of the microphone and run amuck all over. He was wearing all black, as expected. Dangerously low-rise jeans, a black vest over his bare chest, and a gray jersey to boot. I <3'ed so much Martin Gore's hat. I'd describe it if I could.

Now, the setlist. I wish I could remember all of it. Sadly, I was way too excited to log it in my mind. The <i>true</i> surprise of the night came with 'I Feel You', where I believed I was going to pass out. Other favorites were 'Precious', 'Sinner In Me', 'In Your Room', 'Enjoy The Silence', 'Home'. I am sad 'Shake The Disease' was not in the playlist, but I had a feeling they would not play it. But nothing, nothing excuses the fact they did not play 'Policy Of Truth'!

'Personal Jesus' deserves a whole new paragraph, as does the closing song, 'Never Let Me Down Again'. You could <i>feel</i> the rush of energies in these two songs. Personal Jesus had no shame, honestly. It was a unified chorus the one we sang. We knew the movements, the pauses, the gestures. You could pick up every single instruments from the acoustics, Gahan's deep voice escalating through the air. With 'Never Let Me Down Again'... I wanted to cry. Honestly. Especially when right in the middle of the song, this rain started to pour down on us. It was so symbolic! With the lights, you could see the drops of rain cut right and down, showering everyone. All hands aloft, shaking in a horizontal way.

I still wanted to cry when it was over. ;_;

The exit of the stadium was the worst! Too many people, way too narrow exists, too much water. I was <i>soaked</i> from head to toes by the time we reached our car. My poncho tore as I weaseled my way through the crowds, so I had to discard it altogether. Amazingly enough, I am not sick today... and my sister is.

Between all and all, this was the finest concert I have ever been to. Yes, I wish I could have been closer to the stage, but the screens made up for that. Besides. DM has one of the best art concepts, showed in his record covers art. 

Sorry to say, Interpol. But someone else has stolen your place in my heart as the best concert ever."

I will not be online in quite a while. I am sorry I cannot make this more personal, by sending you an offline through Yahoo!, but I decided it would be best to write this down for all that would even care to read it.

School has become excruciatingly taxing.

Just today I was assigned a couple of expositions. One is for Thursday, the other for next Tuesday. The former involves a whole unit of my Commerce class. Even though it is supposed to be developed in a team, Angie and I are one member short, considering Sam left for Cuba last Saturday and will not be returning until next week. So, it is up to us to get the grade. I don't even know what Sam will do, though, so she'll probably get a zero there.

As for the rest, my cold is killing me. I lost my voice today, and it seems to be rather fond of its vacation, refusing to come back.

I promise I will make it up to all of you, in the terms we agreed.

Be safe, everyone.

With love,

Ana."

"event","Well, there is not much I have to say. Those who assure they know will be more than likely acquainted with my nature. And that means that while I can be the most talkative person, when placed in front of a computer I lose all communicative powers. Therefore, I would like to excuse on that the rather empty constitution of my journal thus far.

However, I felt compelled to typing because this is such a good day! I am finally recovering from my cold... something that ended really bad Sunday afternoon, shots included. But I would hate to elaborate on that, and if you are really curious, then you can ask for the details.

And what keeps me in such a good mood? Well, I finally managed to contact two of my best on-line friends that had been missing. Seth and Anna. I am glad to see both of them are in good health, and the latter in enough of a good mood to indulge me into some of our truly beautiful and amusing Harry Potter RP. Ha. The situations we force our characters into. ~Snorts.~

Other than that, not much has been going on... other than the dastard achievements of homework, and akin affairs.

Adios~."

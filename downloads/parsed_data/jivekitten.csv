however

- i feel like i should start by saying that if given the choice i would totally buy a 'team jessica' shirt long before i would buy a 'team nick' shirt. 

sure, jessica's strayed from her virgin ways. i have to be honest, though. first off, she's gotten totally h-o-t  hot but i also fully believe that nick cheated. you don't get TWO stories about your infidelity in several magazines without  a single defamation lawsuit. 

seriously.

you cheated on your wife. she got hot and got horny. get over it. 

besides, it's not like he's been hurting for dates since she filed for divorce. 

with that being said, a few things have happened in my life that i feel are documentable. is that a word - documentable? oh well, it is now. if jim carrey is cool enough to make up words, then god dammit, i am too.

so, yeah.

yesterday...

i got a tattoo. of what, you ask? well, you'll just have to see it to believe it. 

beyond that, i guess i do have a few things to say...

i got engaged on may 9th. 
i'm also pregnant with michael jackson's lovechild...

ok, i lie. 

i also drink a lot of champage. so what do i know?

with the implementation of the +/- scale next fall, i can kiss my 4.0 goodbye. it's one thing to get at least a 90 but to consistently keep my grades above a 96 is impossible. 

i guess it was bound to happen, so i really should just get over it. if i were planning on going to grad school, i could see why i would worry. i'm not though. so my obsession with a 4.0 needs to end.

i went to estoria and hung out with some of my favorite people, had a few drinks and some good conversation. i got to watch one of my best friends finally be happy with someone who truly deserves him. i also got to wear a smoking hot leather jacket and beat up on nic when he needed it.  

most important of all, i was able to stop drinking after a few drinks and go home at a decent hour. it feels good to actually use self control. 

lauren and i made a stop for fast food and then met up at my house with jacqueline. we listened to french pop music, played with happy meal toys, told stupid stories, and looked at pictures from the best summer of our lives (2003 for those keeping track).

it was truly a perfect night. now i am off to shari's baby shower. we haven't seen each other since she got pregnant even though we've been trying since november. i'm so excited for her and i can't wait to rub her little belly.

the only thing missing from my perfect weekend is bob. i hope he comes back around soon, i really miss him.

i'm really fucking tired.

so i will just say this. chris and i were once again unable to wait until christmas to exchange presents. guess what i got? i'll give you a big hint. 

it's an ibook! 

ok, so that was basically the answer. fuck it, i'm tired and i've had a couple of beers.

chris also had his phd qualifying exams today. he passed. of course he did. i had no doubt that he would but he did and he was pretty stressed out about it. so it was great news to find out that he passed and the stress is over. well, at least until med school interviews next month. again, i have no worries. what is meant to be will be. i am sure of it. 

anyway, i do want to talk about my weekend and gwen stefani. i swear, they go hand in hand. no really, they do.

right now, though, my eyes are too droopy to continue typing. i just wanted to share the good news of my new present and the outcome of chris' exams.

g'night everyone!

oh! and lauren gave me my christmas present today. it is possibly the coolest thing ever (besides an ibook). it is a lamp that says ""on air"". i can't wait to put it up in my apartment. i love you, lauren, xoxoxo!

if only i had time (or money) to go buy pants that fit. until i do, forgive the bunchy crotch area. that is all the extra fabric that once covered my ginormous belly and thighs. 

--------------------------------------------

finals are over for me a week from tomorrow. christmas break is my favorite break. i can't relax over thanksgiving and spring break because i know i still have massive amounts of work ahead of me. summer break is just too fucking long. my brain feels all mushy when i get back to school. winter break is just long enough that i miss classes again and there is zero stress since i have yet to discover the work that lies ahead of me next semester. 

i think i will be celebrating the end of the semester (and hopefully sustaining my 4.0) at amanda and jacky's party at the mark next friday. come out and laugh at how my clothes are all too big for me. 

---------------------------------------------

the benefit was absolutely fucking fantastic. i loved every minute of it. dan from i am the world trade center is now one of my favorite people. and, hey, why was i unaware that they were so much fun to see live? guess i've had my head up my own ass for the past six years. 

i also spent part of the evening chatting with stephen from boulevard. he's one of those guys that reminds me that eyeliner on (certain) guys is a good thing. although, i am convinced that he is a total manwhore. since that doesn't really affect me either way, it's safe for me to say that i adore him x 1000. 

by the way, cassie and robert are interviewing boulevard tomorrow on the georgia music show and they are playing on friday at the drunken unicorn with creve couer and spy. go see them. 

yeah, so anyway. we raised almost $3000 for the station and everyone had a blast. we're planning an even bigger benefit for the spring. maybe some of you slackers will actually make it out to that one. eh, or not.

"event","i just heard what sounded like chris gasping for breath in the other room. i froze with fear before realizing that he was laughing to himself about something on tv. 

that laugh was the most beautiful thing i have heard all day. it had nothing to do with my brief fear that he was gasping for air. it was just so chris and so sweet and so everything i love about him all wrapped up in one tiny laugh.

this probably makes no sense to anyone else but i wanted to document it so that i can remember the little moments that fill my heart with so much love.

its just that i have been getting calls from the cobb county adult detention center all night and morning. i assumed that it was a wrong number when i went to bed last night. at what point do you realize that you've wasted your entire evening in jail calling the wrong number? and if its not the wrong number, who in the hell thought to call me to come get their ass out of jail? and why aren't they leaving their name in the appropriate spot to let me know that? 

well, if you're behind bars and need me to come get you - please SAY YOUR NAME next time you call. then i might actually accept it."

"event","i'm sitting around the studio twiddling my thumbs, so i thought i might update my journal. 

i'm wearing myself thin these days between school, work and the station. every few days i feel like i'm at the end of my rope but, somehow, i always pull through. most of it boils down to the fact that i have such an amazingly patient and supportive boyfriend. its nice to have someone to turn to when you feel like the world is caving in on you. 

i produced my first show for the station. it was a mistykiss tribute show that i aired on outbreak on saturday night. i did some interviews, editing and recording which means i learned how to use the mini-disk recorder and cool edit pro. it also means that i've started my portfolio. 

i might also be interviewing matt pond pa on monday. i'm really excited but we're just waiting to hear back from their label to see if the slot i offered works for them. if so, its on!

school is going well. i've taken my first test in all but one class, making no lower than 95 on all of them. 

work is, well, work is hell. i hate my job. i am applying for a new one as soon as i finish my resume. this time, though, i'm trying to stay away from the food service industry. i am at my breaking point with the immaturity and drama that comes along with that industry. 

i was inducted into the national society for collegiate scholars two weeks ago. this past weekend i attended yuriko and edo's baby shower. they're having a little girl and naming her momoko which means peach child. i can't wait to see her! 

on sunday, october 30 from 4-6pm i will be doing a free form on 88.5. its called 'monster mash' and is going to be two hours of mashup. greg white is helping me put it together and i'm really excited about it. 

i feel like i've just put together a bunch of really simple sentences to form one long, boring entry. forgive me. i am leaving for pittsburgh on thursday but i think my brain preceded me by a few days."

"event","um, i spent 3.5 hours at music midtown yesterday and was almost ready to start killing people when i made my way to the {insert whatever random sponser} stage for public enemy. 

then all was saved.

you know what, i take that back. things were pretty damn good after watching the beginning of devo's set. those guys fucking rock it to russia. i really would have liked to have seen more but i was far more interested in public enemy. i <3 chuck d and i wanted to peep these s1w guys. 

seriously, i had a grand fucking time. and i think i want to be an s1w in my next life. 

thats all. now i must go float around in some chlorinated water until my fingers get wrinkly."

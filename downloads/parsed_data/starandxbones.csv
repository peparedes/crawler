"event","i apologize about the knife entry... just me being scared/nervous/insecure, right...
i must seem like the biggest asshole to anyone that reads my or another dear persons journal, so this is the last time i'm going to ever look at this site.
no big loss right? maybe i'll know only what i'm supposed to know and be happy.
nothing is going on with anybody, it;s all in my head.
i just can't keep fighting, its killing me/us.
paranoia is a dangerous thing, especially to an obsessive/depressant...
i love you abby, i know that more than anything."

its another drunken night before my day off. 
i am still under the belief that if i am wasted, by myself, on a... shit, is it tuesday? night, then i am simply nursing the beginnings of a problem. hmmmm.
of all the things that i miss the most about abby being gone, i would have to say that just knowing where she is is the worst. i think she is in switzerland now... but i am not sure. onlyy 12 more days.
its funny, when she is here i have her to vent/talk/whine to... but now that she is away, i am writing in this thing again... funny how desolation will push me to whine to the virtual world."

"event","got some work on my arm, not as much as i had hoped, just two hours, so i only had to pay half the $... from the wristto just below the elbow. with the trade of the plaque and shadowbox, that worked out to an hour and a half of time, plus the leftover money credited, gives me three/four hours on the 23 free. since mike is giving me a break in the price, i figure i'll give him a sweet tip tho. we decided on a lotus and water to fill the back of my bicep. that will pretty much be the sleeve! still hoping for the shamrock on the elbow, but i need to wait and see how it'll look with the other stuff. i=excited. abby is at the moulan rouge right now... i think it's pretty funny that she leaves and gets to go all over europe, and to the titty show! ah well, i got to get tattooed. i really hope she likes it, otherwise i'll have to wear long sleeves forever! hah! i figure it's my arm and it was already at the wrist, so i might as well finish it, and in the best way possible. 
tomorrow is going to be fun, my boss ruined this  wicked pissed-off guys irreplacable posters, has no idea what he has done, and i am probably going to have to deal with an irate, no, fucking furious customer. great. steve, ,my boss, will blame it on somone else, and he will keep his job. this guy has gotten away with theft, sexual harrasment, giving away large amounts of stuff, lying and ruining at least two or three other people's art. if this won't shitcan him, then it proves that he is untouchable.

"event","today marks the halfway point as to when abby comes back. this past three weeks has taken fucking forever to go by. i keep dreaming that she comes back, like time sped up and stuff...
tomorrow i go back for another 4 hour tattoo session, hopefully filling from the wrist up to about the elbow, should be easy, as it is mostly fill work. 
i made abby a plaque that says ""girl you want"" with razor blades, bullets and metal skulls. i was going kind of tankgirl-theme with it. i think it came out good. i need to finish this painting i am working on, it is taking too long. i also feel the need to do a large-ish ink drawing, just to see if i still can...
fuck, my shoes (vans old skools, black/red... badness.) are splitting seriously bad. i really like these shoes too... fuuuuck."

 hm. leats see, i am in the midst of some serious tattoo work... abby is gone, leaving me completely alone to drink away the nights.... i've only worked on like two paintings and one stencil during the last three weeks... and i suck. yes, i'm whining to the what... three people that read this... if that... but fuck it, its three more people than i have to talk to. ah, i got the screeching =weasel vinyl i was waiting for, and the nice people at fineprint sent me buttons with it, and a copy of ben weasels zine, blood on the ice. and i found an old discount record... they're really fucking good.

she moves back home tomorrow... 
i really hope the distance dosn't fuck with anything.
i know it is only for a few months, and it is only an hour drive, but somtiiimes even a few inches seems like it is too far.
maybe a few days per week apart will do us both some good, she can hang out with her friends from home and i can slowly finish my coomic book...
i  graduate college in a couple weeks a,d i seem to have lost the stupid invitations... pretty typical thing for an idiot of my caliber. fuck."

whatthefuckever.
my head is so full of shit that i'm supposed to accept that i can't really eat/sleep/think.
i can sleep, but the dreams are too painful.
i can eat, but nothing tastes right.
i can think, but the thoughts all come back to the same thing. maybe i need to drink  more or somthing... 
everyone is taking sides on this and i am left to be the little wimpy kid leftover in dodgeball.
no one is seeing me in the picture.
i want her to be happy, but it would be nice to have at least a few votes for me... just to make sure i am really here.
words can't describe how much i need her, but all she wants is a change. can't blame her... everyone else leaves.
shit.
listen to me, i sound like an emo song.
now all i need is a hardcore breakdown."

"event","why can't i seem to do anything right? i can't even remember to do this thingy regularly.
i think i was born with the specific instructions to fuck everything up as often as possible. i seriously try not to, but the harder i try the worse i screw things up.
i feel like i have destroyed any chance of a good life for abby. i make her so mad and i don't know why it happens. i try to do what she says, i really try to listen, but in the end it seems thast i miss the one little detail that meant the most. i dunno.
she means so much to me and i think she hates me and is afraid to tell me... without her i would have to live in my car, but even my car would remind me of her so i don't think i could keep it... so that leaves moving back with my parents, my father would love to laugh at me again, at another fucking failure. i can't do that. i won't do that.
i have to work from 2:30 till 10 tonight, everybody is going to be pissed or stressed out because of model store. i probably won't be able to do my greens wall because some other store manager is coming to do it. i used to enjoy produce, but here it is entirely too anal and way to stressful.
i don't even have any friends to rant to about this..."

i guess my dumb fucking brain decided to forget that she told me she would be back at 12.....
i left at like 11:30...
she called and was pissed, but wouldn't let me explain, just kept hanging up on me... i couldn't even explain myself...
said i had time to come back, but in the time it would have taken to drive back, i would have had to leave to go to work.....
now i'm the ass, the one who let her down.
i always swore i wouldn't do that...
she means so much and i blew it."

a friend, possibly former friend, is seriously laying the mack on abby... i don't know what to do.

ummm, work is normal i can deal with veggies, my car is a biotch because it needs like $400 worth of work so it can get inspected.... and i just bought it last year....... why couldn't i find a nice corrupt mechanic....
my favorite comic book may be cut short, the artist rob g had an apartment fire and lost the art to the next three issues. he and his cat got out alright tho, YAY!!
my parents officially disowned me because i stood up for myself about them claiming me on their tax returns.... awwww maybe if my father got a job earning more than 8 dollars an hour and spent less money on porn he wouldn't have to worry about who he could rip off.... not like he has 13 thousand dollars in collrge loans to repay...

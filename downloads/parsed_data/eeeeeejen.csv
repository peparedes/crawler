"event","So. It's been a while. Naturally, it's another late night, and I am having the same breakdown I've been having for the last five months. By now, everyone is tired of listening...alas, I have turned elsewhere to find a means of release. Sad. 
The basis of these breakdowns: love..obvi. And committment. I always thought I was totally open to the idea... I was the girl searching for the guy who was willing to commit to me...Right?  =(

It really sucks to be on the outside looking in, now realizing what was really going on the last couple years of my love life; to finally see, all too late, that the man of my dreams was by my side through thick and thin-a best friend.  Let's say his name was Pete.  Pete and I met my first year of college. He was soooo brilliant. Our friendship immediately took off like a rocket...and seemed to be one that would withstand anything.  After a while, Pete confessed his love for me...We dated for a couple months...I ended it. We remained friends, and he'd frequently tell me his feelings for me remained the same.  I knew as time passed that I was falling in love with him, but would never pursue a relationship, because of ridiculous reasons I'd convince myself to believe...

This past summer, I went to Australia. While I was there, in a country across the world from home, I found myself wishing one person were there with me- Pete. While the trip overall was spectacular, each night I'd lay in bed and think about him. If only *he* were there, the trip would be absolutely perfect.  I thought it over and finally decided that I'd gather up all my nerve and tell him how I felt when I returned home-tell him that I want nothing more than to be his. Tell him that all the while, I knew he was -perfect- for me, and the only thing keeping me from him was my committment issue--I knew that if I were to end up with him, it'd be for forever...and that scared me...that's why I ended our initial try at a relationship.  Ugh I was so silly. And ready to admit it and end our separation. 

Naturally, I return from Australia, only to find that he has a new girlfriend. Fuck. Now I am in a whirlwind of questions and emotions and anxiety and confusion. And <b>regret</b>. Did he ever really love me? I mean, he did hang around a couple years...am I just out of luck? Obviously he'd move on, right? But the thing that gets me is, since he has gotten this new girlfriend, our friendship has been shot to hell. He hasn't even personally told me about the new girl--damn facebook. (=  We hardly ever talk, haven't seen each other in the last 5 months...we aren't friends...Pete has erased me from his life. So, now I'm feeling like our friendship meant absolutely nothing to him...after we broke up the first time, he said how he still wanted to be friends...that my friendship meant more to him...was it a lie? Was he only sticking around, acting as a friend in attempt to see if we would start a relationship again? 

I have always been terrible with timing, but this just kills me.  Now all the bloody 'What if's' and 'What could have been's' are racing through my head, and I can't take it. I miss him. So badly. My friends told me to give him space--that he was just avoiding me to get over me...So I did...but now, I don't know if I could even bear to see him..knowing he is in love with another girl..My heart couldn't take it. I would not be able to keep my composure. 

Oh, what do i do???  Now the  only 'advice' coming my way is 'Get over it'. If only it were that easy.  How do I do it? How do I say goodbye?  

I love Pete. 
I love -<i>Andrew</i>-

Ugh. Happy Christmas, all."

As it is, I wonder who controls the world...How we act, how we feel. I don't think emotion should be allowed. I'm just another victim in the horrible game- one of lies, cowardice, misunderstanding.  What's the point?  <br>

Do small moments of pure happiness or love truly predominate all the pain?
I cannot believe that this is the case...<br>

I'm not bipolar or anything, it's just that I have a lot of good things in my life, but a lot of crap, too. You know how people say, oh you have money, or you have two parents that love you, or you have friends, what right do you have to be depressed? It's the standard. It's trying to be what everyone else wants me to be. It's being so stressed out that you can't let go of anything anymore. It just stays with you, until it all builds up and you feel like you want to explode. Yeah. Sometimes I love my life, and, yes I thank God for all the wonderful things in it. But other times it hurts so bad, and I cry, and beg Him to make my life different. Change it. Erase my memories. Just put it all away. 


I wrote an essay today for a scholarship...The topic was ""If you could have one 'do-over' in life, what would it be?"" Naturally, this shoved me into a pool of past decisions which I try so hard to forget, and a never ending list of 'what ifs'. What if I never ended up going to the U of A? What if I took out a student loan and moved to Oregon, Texas, or California? What if I worked harder, went to all my classes? What if I decided to hold on to my virginity all those years ago? What if I didn't go out of my way to piss my dad off? What if Andrew and I were still together? What if I never cheated on Jay...? Fuck it. I guess I've learned you can't dwell on those what ifs...it'll only eat you alive. They say you shouldn't regret anything-that it all shapes who you are and who you've become... <br>

Well what if I don't like the person I have become? <br>

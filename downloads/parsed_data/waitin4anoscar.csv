"event","Not that much of a post this time. I've been really pissed lately because my mom won't drive me ANYWHERE to do stuff. I understand though since I live in Shalimar, but thats just another reason why I wish i lived somewhere else besides Shalimar. So I'll just wait till my dad gets back ,to do something cuz he lives in N-ville, from Peru cuz he's TDY(military slang)"

"event","Well my friend Levi Baumgrass isn't going to be here untill the end of the week. So I havent really known what to do. SO yesterday I hung out with my cousin, Brandon. Then today I went to the beach and got a little bit of sun. I was gonna go to the commons tonight but my friends cant go so i have no one to go with really so o well. I'll probably just go tomorrow night. I don't know. I think the best thing about this spring break so far, is that i get to sleep in for a long time every morning."

"event","Well this is my first entry on Live Journal. I heard a lot of people talking about it so I did it. 

Today was pretty good I guess I have to write a book report for ""Of Mice and Men"" by the end of tonight. So that should be fun.(NOT!!) Well I have a new partner for CFL qualifiers for nationals in forensics. Yeah it was Walt Hartley but he cant make it. So now I have Brian Robertson(REPENT!)lol. But he's pretty talented and with some practice, I think we are going to perform well.

Well off to type up a report. cya."

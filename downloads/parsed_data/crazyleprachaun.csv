"event","When you piss me off i will retaliate and i have no remorse for you if you push me.  Some people need to learn due to their stupidity and utter retardness they should not get into arguments with someone like me i will make you cry. (Oh yeah stupid bitches piss me off).  But on a better note things couldnt be going better between me and mine she's the greatest thing thats ever happened to me yet still it took me almost too long to appreciate to the degree she deserves (IM sorry for that).  I got B.A. Jr. back my piranha heelllll yeahhhhhhhhh.         goooooooouuleaa"

"event","Yesterday was one of the greatest days i've had in a while, first i showed up to work and wasnt scheduled sweeeetttt!!  Than my baby Deana took me to the olive Garden you'd think that would have been the highlight of my day, but than I had the best ride home ever (I <3 you Baby).  A pussy named james decided its still better to run than take an ass beating thats comin. James your still gonna get your ass beat no matter how much you run.  I might get kicked out of my apartment so im gonna move in with someone special to me (Deana) it'll be perfect.  On a differnt subject Mango Buddah is back around.

"event","Everthing is going perfect, I could not be happier with my relationship staus. Never once have i told a girl she ment anymore to me than someone to have around until i met someone in may who changed all of that, and thats the woman that couldnt make me happier.  /ON another note my school is the biggest bunch of bullshit in the world for my phone just going off me not even responding to it caused me to get suspended what kind of horseshit is that./  My best friend has a warrant out for his arrest and is suggested to be armed and dangerous by his own father that wont let him choose where he wants to live but instead his dad would rather than have his son comfortable and not have to worry about B.S. and be able to go to school.  His dad would rather have him being chased by the cops and have him brought back to B.F.E I have a message for you Abel Martinez ""Your nothin but a MUTHA FUCKEN PIECE OF SHIT AND YOU WILL NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING with all this bullshit and all its gonna do is cause problems for you so watch your back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!         PEACE BIIIIIIITCHHH"

"event","Bad days come and go but horrible ones will haunt you for what feels like a million years when you do something you regret as soon as it happens what more can you do than stop and even though what you did was so wrong but you know and you truly are sorry most apologies go unaccepted and blown off but every now and then they get accepted and even though you still feel guilty you know you'll never do it again so you get a feeling of euphoria realizing everything couldnt have worked out better      ""IM in L%*E with this girl""!                    PEACE"

Today there was a huge fire in a building on Oxford Street here in London.  My flat is above a store across the street and about half a block down from where the fire was, so once I'd negotiated my way past the police line I had a pretty good view of the fire.  Luckily nobody was hurt, but they had to close the street for at least eight blocks (for those of you haven't been here, closing Oxford Street is a bit like burning money - it's the busiest shopping area of London, much to my perpetual dismay).  Anyway, the fire was really intense (as you can see from my photo), and they're still working on putting it out almost ten hours later.

Whilst rubbernecking, I began to think about what would happen if a similar fire broke out a week from now.  I counted nine firetrucks, each of which was being used to fight the fire, not to mention all the cops who had rushed in to get people out of the area.  All this and they could barely beat the fire.  Ok.  Take away petroleum - trucks, city water pumps, etc.  I suppose emergency teams would have reserves of some kind, but this fire required the full abilities of the entire fire brigade.  Any limitations on their resources, and it would have been the whole block, maybe even another 1666 (though the lack of wooden buildings and thatched roofs probably serves to keep us a bit safer).

Anyway, I'm just thinking that if emergency teams are impaired that disaster (natural or otherwise) are going to be magnified.  This just keeps getting scarier.  I'm taking my gal to Wales for a long weekend (see entry below).  When it (whatever 'it' is) hits on Monday, we'll at least be in a good starting place.  I hope you all have a good plan and good company."

"event","As I'm sure many of us have been, I've been spending much of my time over the past few days thinking about the 30th, the possible implications, solutions, etc.  I have been very impressed by the ability of some folks to suddenly become (seemingly) full-time researchers, supplying the group with vital background info - so thanks to rumpletoe, yumemirusabaku, staxnet, and everyone else who's been contributing.  I think you're setting a good tone for this community.

One thing that hasn't been addressed in the short time that we've all been communicating has been culture after the shock.  Obviously, basic needs come first, but in the face of the crisis, I think that the arts have the potential to play an important role.  In whatever various environments people manage to establish themselves, a few people organizing a band or a play or creating artwork (etc.) could give people something more than a fire to gather around, as well as provide an expressive outlet in what will surely be a frustrating time.

I recall reading an article (though I can't find it at present) about a group of classically trained musicians in a WWII concentration camp who managed to procure instruments and (with difficulty) permission to play a concert for the other prisoners.  As you can imagine, the event was uplifting for all those involved.  Hopefully the parallel between the post-shock world and a concentration camp is an inappropriate comparison.

In a recent interview in which Bjork was discussing her upcoming release, she said something that has inspired me in light of the impending crisis:

""I mean, the human race, we are a tribe, let's face it...We're all fucking animals, so let's just make some universal tribal beat. We're pagan. Let's just march.""

(I assume the above expletive is a modifier, not a verb)

I don't feel that we need to revert to animalistic behavior (indeed, I hope we grow from this), but I think her attitude is very appropriate for what's coming.  I think that once much of our industry is taken from us - when batteries start to run out and we're left in the dark at dusk every night, I think that we're going to become much more aware of the fact that we're all in the same boat (that boat being Earth) and that we will, in fact, need to stick together - like a tribe, as it were - to survive.  Anyway, I think that music, theater, art, etc. can be what brings people together in the face of the crisis.

So, I'd like to take on the role and responsibility of media/arts coordinator (or some such title) within this little group we've got going here.  I'm not entirely sure what I'll be able to pull together, but for starters I'll make a habit of posting things to this blog to share with you all with the intent of cheering you up or inspiring you.  If anyone else is interested in joining this effort, please contact me (I'm thinking we can set up a community page like the main WWO one, but with a media/arts focus).

Share #1:  Panda Bear - Comfy in Nautica
Panda Bear is one of the longstanding members of the Animal Collective.  His recent solo release, Person Pitch (on Paw Tracks records), is a fun listen - combining dreamy collages of low-fi instrumentation and ingeniously edited-together city noises, Panda Bear's vocals evoke Brian Wilson, making for an instant-old-favorite.  The opening track, ""Comfy in Nautica,"" is a highlight of the record.  Enjoy!

PS - bertrent.imeem.com is NOT me.  I'm at siriusb.imeem.com - if you're not familiar with imeem (as I was until a day or two ago), it's yet another social networking site, but it's very mediacentric and makes it VERY easy to share stuff.  Check it out!"

"event","So I was lying in the grass of beautiful Regent Park today, surrounded by thousands of people completely unaware of the situation and just having a good time - relaxing, talking, sharing food, playing with their children - and I came to realize that my instinctual reaction to the predicament (disappear into the woods and subsist on my own) was not what I really wanted.  The human race is, at the end of the day, a beautiful thing, and I want to do whatever I need to to keep it around a little longer.  Then, as I was trying to decide whether I smelled rain on the wind, an airplane crossing the sky moved into view.  As it passed over me, a bird flew in a perpindicular path - I noticed the similarity in shape.  We mastered flight from observation - all those other crazy flying contraptions failed, but the one that most closely resembles a bird worked.  Then I thought about the articles on biomimicry that mPathyTest has been posting.  I'm focusing my efforts thusly.

PS - I'm going to go ahead and add everyone in the WWO community as a friend (the more friends the better at a time like this, right?)"

"event","Check this out!  This little town in Wales has begun to move away from a dependence on oil.  This is what I'm hoping to see in the coming weeks - a long-awaited return to localism in the face of energy crisis.  Unfortunately, I just don't see how this sort of positive approach could ever work in a place as huge and complex as London.  People are going to panic here - I'm really starting to worry about my physicial location for the beginning of this - I think that's going to matter as much (perhaps more) than the fact that I've had an early warning.  My girlfriend and I had been talking about taking a long weekend in the countryside.  Maybe we'll visit Totnes!

"event","London is bathed in oil.  It's even inside my nostrils at the end of the day.  I'd be happy to see it go.  But I'm so far from home, how would I stay in contact with the people I love and trust?

Maybe I should be establishing rendezvous points or something."

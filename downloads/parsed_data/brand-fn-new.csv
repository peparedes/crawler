Okay, so on Sunday, I had the bright idea to dye my hair black. My mom planned on doing it, but she decided not to, so we had extra dye. So I do it, and I get dye all over my face, of course. So I try to get it off, and most of it does come off, excpet for this giant thing on the side of my face. I started trying to rub it off, and i just ended up rubbing a good protion of my FACE OFF. So, now I have a black blotch on my face, and a burn in the center of it. Nice, I know. So then, Monday I have a game that  I find out about an hour before the bus leaves. (Thanks, by the way, Brianna). I go, and I don't play for about the first half. Then, about 3/4 of the way through the second half, the coach puts me and I'm in for the rest of the game. When the game's almost done, me and this girl both go for the ball, and we collide and smash heads. I walk away with a bump above my head, and she gets driven away in an ambulance. She had a concussion! I felt so bad, I wanted to apologize, so I did to the coach and he said he'd pass it on. The bump's pretty big, it doesn't really hurt, but oh well. So now I have a bump, a burn, and a blotch. Fun fun fun. So yep, the varsity won too, that was an awesome game. They destroyed the other team, ours was like an underdog story. We were losing in the first half, and then they put me (hah, not to sound conceited).

I have no friends. The beginning of the summer was awesome. My life was going great. I had a boyfriend, had dozens of friends. Of course we broke up and no one even calls me anymore.

Not to sound like Liana, but the summer IS grinding to a stop! I hate it. It pisses me off a whole bunch. I have orientation the day after tomorrow. It's going to suck. I hate it.

Well, at least this summer some good things did happen-
-I got an acoustic guitar and a new bass
-became friends with Ling again

You are one big mess of misunderstood emotions.<br>Unfortunatelly you lost all of your friends<br>once you started wearing only black, Gap<br>sweaters and fake glasses. The good news is<br>that you now have a whole new ring of<br>anti-social, well-dressed friends. You sure got<br>a way with style, and the music you listen to<br>is enough to make even the hardest of people<br>break down in tears.

"event","Well I started classes this week which is wicked awesome. I got interviewed for my job in the admissions office, also wicked awesome. I get to come home Friday, triple wicked awesome. Now a little about my friends.

Colleen, is a freak, she is my roomate but she is so much fun. To be honest you wouldnt think that I would have that much in comman with her, but our differences make us understand each other more. 
Curtis is Colleens bf, btw her nickname is coco so ill be refering to her as that. He is cool, he is my C-Dawg....lol We pick on CoCo and she hates it sooo very much....lol
Heather is me....lol we act so much alike but yet so different, i think she and I will be like best of friends forever. I am soooo glad taht I found her because I dont know how I could handle the next four years without her, or CoCo for that matter.

My classes arent taht hard so far, my ES (Erskine Seminar) is about critical thinking and it is sooo fun. My Old Testament class is awesome. My math class sux but yall know I hate math. My art class is starting tomorrow, I hope it is good. My psych professor is a freak. His favorite quote is ""Sex and religion are in excess until you become a professional"" that is the reason he says the people at the seminary dont like him that much. 

I found out they have a ceremony here called Candlelight, its when a girl gets engaged she tells like her closest friends and they make flyers and they have a circle in fromt of Bonner (upper classmen girls) and they pass the candle around one full time then the second time when it gets to the girl who is engaged she blows it out and then she gets into the circle and she tells how it happens then they soak her in water or throw her into the fountain outside of Carnegie (freshman Girls Dorm). Because of that tradition when I get engaged it will be a secret.....well prolly not. Ill leave it to CoCo or Heather to tell and throw me in the fountain....lol

So me and Daniel are trying to make this work, and I sooo very much want it to cuz I love him soo much!!!!!
Kisses to you baby!!!!
I love you always
Love,
Me"

"event","Well guys I finally made it to Erskine!!! I still dont know if I like it or not. I cried for like ever, and i just dont know yet, i cant get over this whole homesick thing, its killing me. 

OMG Daniel, you and my mom were soooo wrong me and Colleen get along great, we are so much alike it isnt funny, its kinda scary actually. I know you miss me but I miss you more than you will ever know and I love you soooo very much, I love you with all my heart and soul. I had a good time at the soiree, it was really funny because there are more girls than guys so me and Colleen didnt get dates.....its your wish come true and Im not even playing. Because she was last and I was two ahead of her. Everyone was so nice and I know you want me to hate it here and come home to you, I want to come home to you as well, but I kinda like it here and I want to give it a shot. Do not worry because no matter what no one could ever take me away from you, I am yours and youra alone, thats how much I love you and no Im not just saying that. I really do love you and miss you so much I want to cry every time I look at your pix.

Anyway yall, I have breakfast at 8 im the morning and if it isnt required I think me and Colleen are going to stay here tomorrow and not go to church so we can get some rest because neither of us has had that much. I love all of yall and miss you all terrible. No matter where I go my heart and soul is still in Gastonia and it will never leave there as long as I have you!!!!

I love you sooo very much,
All My LOve and kisses

"event","well I am soooooooo ready to get away from the hellhole called Gastonia. Many times I believe that I am kept under control by my g-maw because of her breaking down my psyche with some sort of mind abuse. I dont know what to do. 

I do know that my knee has been giving me a fit ever since i went to Carowinds with Kali,Daniel, Mawmaw and Jacob. We had a good time, at least I think we did, I hope we did. Then we went to resonate and told everyone goodbye and that was horrible. I cried so much.

Yesterday, I packed some more and cleaned and spent time with Daniel and I went to the oral surgeon and he said that I was healing fine, then me and Daniel went Wal-mart and bought some more school stuff and some food for the house, then I came home and was all sad and junk.
Then we went to Outback for my ""going away party"" and P. Moose and Amanda were there, and Dusty,Uncle Billy, Aunt Jenny, Chrissy, Josh, Ashley, Mom, Mawmaw, Poppy, and Jacob. We had so much fun, I wish more ppl could have been there. Now i wiah I had invited Lala and Bubba, but hindsight is 20/20. afterwards we (me and ash) went to BAM and got me a mocha, then we waited on Daniel forever, then Ashley went home and Daniel and me brought my car home, amd I went to Wal-mart with him so he could get the rest of the stuff for my picnic, and I came home and crashed.

Today we wemt on a picnic, me and Daniel, and Ashley. Daniel is actually a pretty good cook, yea I gave him a hard time but thats my job. I love him so I have to critiqe him. Then we went to the church and got my check and got a copy of the Case for Christ, which is pretty good so far. Then we went to the pawn shop so Daniel could find out about trading his bass for a five string bass, and i really dont know what he decided but whatever, I was talking to Bubba the whole time, and he was picking on me (nothing new there) and when we left we came home and uhhh he cleaned his bass before he took it back to the shop and then he left and I cleaned and Ashley came over and was with me until about 9 o clock we had fun, we always do and she is gonna miss me...not as much as im gonna miss her though.

Well tomorrow at 5:30am I embark on my newest and scariest adventure ever...Im going to college, Im kinda scared but not really. Im really sad because the friends I thought I once had have suddenly abandoned me and I dont know why, or what is going on, but it really breaks my heart. I was always told that I would lose my friends friend from school and my childhood friends, but I never thought they really didnt like me, or respect me enough to tell me that they didnt want to be friends with me anymore, thats what hurts the most I guess.

Anyway I need to go to bed so I can get up so I can move. I love you guys, Ill do this again tomorrow and let yall read about my pain tomorrow. Love and kisses always

"event","OMG my foot is asleep and it is all tingly....I think I am losing my mind. Well it is about 2:30am and I am wired...AHH the tingly it tingles I cant stand it!!!! ok Im back. sorry, anyway I want to sleep because Daniel and Kali and me and Jacob are going to Carowinds tomorrow and mawmaw is gonna meet us about 10:30 to get boober. i hope we have a good time tomorrow. I dont want anymore arguments this week. I only have like 2 days left then i have to be gone for 2 weeks before I can come home. I dont know if i can handle it. I know that if I only think about school as a job and that I get two days off that I can spend at home I think I can handle this for 4 years. I dont know but i think i can.

I was talking to Dusty earlier and he said Im proud of you, you have been with Daniel for a while havent you. well it was some sort of variation of that and I was like yea. He was like is he a keeper. and you know I think he may be, as long as we can stay together as long as I am in college. he thinks we can, I definately hope so.

Well I know everyone is holding their breath trying to find out about my roomate, I talked to her once and I think we will get along great. She seems really sweet, and thats all yall get to know. I think I am going to email my proffesor cuz I never got an email back. Which is kinda odd I think. First he skipped me in class at orientation, then he didnt email me back, maybe he has some sort of vendetta against me. Its all a conspiricy, they want my soul!!!!!! ok so Im a drama queen, its almost 3am what do you expect? 

Ok well I guess thats all, ecept I am going to the BC / NoGa football game Friday with Misty, I hope it will be a fun time. 

I want to go to bed!!!!! Thats what I am going to do...Bye yall"

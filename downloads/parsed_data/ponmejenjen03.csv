"event","<br /><span style=""font-size: small"">God, I hate being single! As much as I hate guys: their indecisiveness (ahem, &quot;You decide&quot;), their cheesey romantic lines, and the way they make you fall weak to your knees screaming, &quot;I love you, dammit!&quot; I hate being single even more. It sucks feeling like no one really cares about you. Sure, my mom or roommate will ask how my day went, but they don't really care to listen. It's just to make conversation. I hate not being able to cuddle with someone every night. I don't think it's the trains keeping me awake; it's the fact that I have trouble sleeping alone. Just hearing someone breathe is like the lullaby I need to make me shut my eyes and dream.&nbsp;With Bre in the room, I got to sleep in minutes. Now, I fall asleep to the trains whizzing by, shaking the window. I've curled up so close to that body pillow that some nights it's as if I'm going to make love to it. I'm not horny. It's been three months without sex but I could care less if a penis was shoved up my vagina right now. All I want is someone to talk to every night, someone to sleep with... actually sleep with... and someone who will do little romantic things for me occasionally, but nothing over the top. It's awesome having so much time to myself, but I miss the goodnight hug/kiss and phone calls that last until 2 in the morning. I want a boyfriend again.</span>"

Feelings of missing him have come rushing back like the day we broke up. I just keep wishing he were here and could see my new place. The last thing he said to me keeps ringing in my ears over and over again:&nbsp;&quot;I'm... breaking up with you. No one deserves that. So, bye.&quot; How sudden and straight forward! No explanation or anything. <br />Then a few nights ago I remembered how he worked almost every night of the weekend and that even if we were together he wouldn't be here anyway. So it really isn't that bad. Yeah, I&nbsp;miss the great times we had, but I can also think of some great times I had with Marcus and even Owen. There are plenty of other guys like them or better. If I've found love twice, I can certainly find it again.<br /><br />&quot;If love were a God, I'd be agnostic and you'd be atheist.&quot;<br />-- Jen (talking to Dylan)</span>"

"event","<br /><span style=""font-size: small"">Ok, so I should be studying for my finals tomorrow, but I'd rather write in this stupid journal. I've finished It's Called a Breakup Because it's Broken already. I'm sad I'm done reading it. It was a good book and made me think about a lot of things. Though sometimes points made in the book were obvious, it was still funny and cheered me up. I have a list of books I'm going to start reading for the summer. I love reading before I go to bed now. It gets me relaxed and helps me sleep better. I love all the free time I have. Reading is something I've always wanted to do, but never could because I&nbsp;was busy having a boyfriend. I&nbsp;also like scrapbooking in my spare time. I&nbsp;run a lot more too now. 5 miles is probably something I&nbsp;never would have accomplished with a boyfriend, at least with the ones I've dated so far. Now, if I&nbsp;dated a marathon runner that would be a different story. I'm finding out ways to make myself happy instead of relying on a boy. I have turned away from my friends too much. They have been there for me for years so why do I&nbsp;ditch them for a stupid boy that I've known for a short period of time? I don't know if I'll start dating again soon. I'm sure eventually a guy with curly, long, brown hair and dark rimmed glasses that is creative and artistic will come along and write a poem comparable to Robert Graves' work and we will share poetry with each other&nbsp;all night, but until then I am surprisingly happy being single.</span>"

"event","<br /><span style=""font-size: small"">For once, I'm posting because I'm happy and not depressed or sad, which were my moods in my previous entries, I think. This weekend was so much fun. I got drunk both nights, but didn't have hangovers in the morning and I didn't throw up! I'm proud of myself. Haha, but seriously it's good I was able to stop before getting wasted. My counselor and I talked about if I would ever cheat again. I think after everything that's happened, I won't. It may not mean anything to me, but it means something to other people and I should respect that. Wow, a lesson to be learned! I didn't think there was one in this garbage dump of a situation, but I'm well on my way to being happy again. As Greg Behrendt once&nbsp;said &quot;If you can lie in your bed late at night, loving the skin you're in, you can always count on someone to come along and fuck it up with love.&quot; And that is when I will meet someone, when I'm so happy that I&nbsp;feel like I don't need a boyfriend. <br /><br />It was so great to finally do what I&nbsp;wanted to do this weekend instead of skipping the drinking because Trevor would want to hang out. I could relax and talk to guys without worrying what Trevor would think or what's right or wrong in a relationship. It's still hazy to me. At the moment, I am content with not having a boyfriend. I have a lot more time to do things for myself. It's nice to live for me instead of constanting wondering when I&nbsp;will see my boyfriend next or missing him. Now I&nbsp;don't miss anyone, and I&nbsp;can just focus on making myself happy. Someday I will meet a guy who likes me the way I am, and I won't have to change in order to make the relationship work out. </span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: small"">I used to dread Sundays simply because I&nbsp;had to wake up early and go to church. Now, I really hate Sundays because I'm reminded of when Trevor and I broke up. Some are better than others, but today was miserable. I held back so many tears at work. I&nbsp;still don't know why it's taking so long to get over a stupid boy. I didn't need him before we&nbsp;met&nbsp;to make me happy so I&nbsp;should be happy without him. But every night I dream about him. I've remembered quite a few, surprisingly. Usually I can't remember any of my dreams. I wake up missing him every morning so I must be dreaming about him even if I&nbsp;don't remember. I hate it. I&nbsp;never dreamt about him this much while we were dating. It's like I appreciate&nbsp;him so much more now that he's gone.<br />My counselor has helped me&nbsp;to realize a few things. I think talking to someone once a week has helped. I wish I could talk to her more though. This Wednesday is my last appointment. Although, I wish it wasn't. I don't think I'm going to be completely over him in a week. Or even 2. Another month will go by and I will probably feel exactly the same. It still hurts. It still feels like the day it happened. I don't know what to do to make the hurt go away. I'm going to start reading a book titled It's Called a Breakup Because it's Broken by Greg Behrendt. He also wrote He's Just Not That Into You and Bre read that one and said it was good. How pathetic. But at this point, I'll try anything. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. </span>"

If this is what I have to look forward to for the next six months then I don't know what the hell will stop me from committing suicide. How has Marcus been so strong through our break up? It just feels like there will never be anyone better. At this point, I don't care if I run into Trevor on campus. I&nbsp;think I would kind of like to. Just to see his face again, even though he hates me. I've removed him from my facebook, the one picture that I had of us I deleted, and I'm seriously considering burning his sweatshirt out in the courtyard. I&nbsp;would like to keep it, but it would just make things worse, and the process of getting over him would take a lot longer. I wish we could have talked about breaking up.&nbsp;I&nbsp;could have explained what was going through my head, how I would never do something like that again. I know that would have been meaningless at the time because he was so angry, but you would think after a week he would miss me and we could talk about it. How can he not miss me? He said I was different from all the other girls he dated, that he could talk to me about anything. We made each other laugh and always looked forward to seeing each other. How can this sudden break in our routine be completely fine with him? Doesn't he miss having someone there to talk to? I know I made him really happy and everyone says when I was with him,&nbsp;I&nbsp;was the happiest I had ever been. When Marcus and I broke up, it gave me more motivation, but breaking up with Trevor has been worse. Now, I don't feel like doing anything. I've only ran twice in the past week, and I'm not trying at all with classes anymore. I just gave up. Instead of putting thought into my papers and studying like I should be, I'm just going through the motions. There seems to be no point in living. Who the hell would care if I got hit by one of those fucking Cyride buses and died? I want to feel significantly better by my birthday or something's going to change. </span><br />"

I&nbsp;guess I figure if I&nbsp;find this when I'm fourty, I&nbsp;don't want to my last few entries to be as depressing as they are. And I&nbsp;may not remember this relationship I'm in right now.... scratch that, I&nbsp;won't forget. <br /><br />Trevor McGraw. Whether he thinks so or not, has changed my life. Out of the three years Marcus and I dated, I&nbsp;was unhappy for two of them. As independent as I&nbsp;am, I&nbsp;didn't think I needed a boyfriend to be with all the time, but it's such a relief to be out of that relationship even though I&nbsp;wasn't expecting to meet anyone. Dating Owen might have been a mistake. It ruined our friendship and now it's awkward hanging out. But on a lighter&nbsp;note, I'm glad I met Trevor. I&nbsp;was far from ready to date again and didn't even want a boyfriend, but even if Trevor and I&nbsp;break up now, I know there are better guys out there and Marcus is not the one for me. My favorite part about our relationship is how he can make me laugh even when I&nbsp;don't want to. We have the same sense of humor, which is hard to find. Not even Marcus understood my sarcasm. It's nice to see each other every other day, but neither of us are extremely clingy so I don't feel smothered. I'm so happy! Having a boyfriend is actually fun again. </span>"

"event","&nbsp;Ok, so Marcus and I broke up for two weeks before winter break because I didn't think I wanted a boyfriend anymore. I really thought it was over between us. I mean, we had broken up before but this time seemed different. I didn't want to get back together anytime soon. When break started, I knew we would get back together. I don't know if I wanted to or if it was just a feeling I had, but I knew somehow we would work through the problems we had been having and not to my surprise, we did. I think Marcus convinced me more than anything. I know it was wrong to get back together just so we could have sex, but I really didn't care. It's not that I was horny and just wanted to... I wanted to with him. So maybe deep down I did want to get back together for the right reasons, I knew I loved him and that's all that mattered. I still love him, of course but I feel like we have a very weird relationship now. Things are going great, I love talking to him. Sometimes I feel like I want to talk more than he does, but besides all that, something still feels weird. I love him so much, but now that we know everything about each other I can hate him just as much too. He can be so annoying sometimes and then other times I just hate when he's having fun... like I'm jealous or something, that I wish I could be there having fun with him too. Other times, I hate that he is there and I hate that he wants to be a pilot. I even hate that his dad didn't help him with college like my dad did so then maybe he would have considered going to Iowa State and I would see him a lot more. It's good that I'm going to see him in February, but I wish I didn't have to. I wish we could just be together all the time, at least in the same state. I don't know if we are going to get married or if this is going to last a few more years or just a few more months but right now I know I love him... enough to put up with all of this... and hope things will get better in the future."

"event","Ok. I'm not sure if writing this all&nbsp;out is going to help,but &nbsp;it's worth a shot.&nbsp;Recently Marcus has mentioned HIS plans for after we both graduate. He wants me to move in with him while he goes to school in Texas or some other state, doesn't matter. This freaks me out a lot! I have thought about marriage and I've even pictured it a few times but I guess I only pictured the wedding itself, not actually living together. I'm not ready for that! How can he talk about it so casually? I mean, that is a HUGE step! I just don't want to think about it. 

Besides that, lately our relationship seems to be going downhill. I mean, I can't talk to him like I used to. Well, I guess I CAN, I just... don't want to. Is that horrible or what? He's just not funny anymore and we never talk about anything remotely interesting. It's always ""how did your day go?"" And then I describe my day and that lasts for a good 20 minutes and then there is absolutely nothing to talk about! I hate it. I feel bad for not calling him, but at the same time I don't want to call at all because it's so FUCKING&nbsp;BORING!!! I don't&nbsp;know what to do. How do I fix&nbsp;this? Should I fix it? Or are we just growing apart and there's nothing I can do? 

Talking to Bryant helped a lot... more than talking to anyone else so far. I don't know&nbsp;what Marcus is going to say or how he's feeling. He probably won't call me tonight after how our conversation ended last night. God, why can't he just understand I need time to think about things? I'm not like him. I can't just talk about things that important on the spot like that. I need time to think it through. And I probably won't call him tonight just for that reason. I'm not ready to talk yet. I need time.&nbsp; 

Anyway, back to Bryant... he said I should just do what makes me happy and Marcus said something like that last night, but I was in awe of it all and it didn't really click. The thing is I don't know WHAT will make me happy. I'm obviously not happy WITH him, but would I be happy without him? I don't think I would. Then again I've been thinking that we were pretty much broken up today and it felt good. I cried a couple of times becuase he's not the guy I thought I loved, but after ""getting over it"" I realized I can make myself happy in other ways. I mean, what the hell has he done for me to make me happy in the last couple of months? Absolutely nothing!! Parent's weekend was such a bore. We were so quiet, we barely talked to each other. How does he think everything is ok? Isn't he bored too? And then Thanksgiving... yeah the sex was great. It was amazing, but other than that, I was SO BORED!! We didn't even do anything. And when I tried to make it interesting by playing cards, he seemed like he didn't want to. He just wanted to lie there. I used to love just laying down on the couch and watching TV, but I do that so much here that I don't want to do that anymore. I want excitement! I want to go out and actually do something! The beginning of our relationship was great because we went out to eat, to the movies, mini golfing. He always seemed to come up with some good idea. Now all we want to do is stay in and make out. I thought that would make me happy, but it doesn't. I need more! I don't think this is completely my fault. I HATE how he lays a fucking guilt trip on me because I don't love him as much as he loves me and that always happens in his relationships. Well FUCK YOU! I don't deserve that! Go tell that to someone else! Talk to Dan for all I care, but I don't ever want to here that shit again! 

Ok. I can understand you want me to ask more about your day and care that you are at that stupid fucking academy, but I need you to make this relationship fun again. You used to be so sweet and funny. You would take me out and we would talk, actually talk about things that were worth talking about. I can't even remember the last good conversation we had. Don't blame this all on me! It's your fault too! A relationship doesn't fall apart just because of one person. You helped too. You aren't the same person I thought you were. You care too much about the future and ""making our lives better."" I still want to be a kid! Maybe I'm just too immature for you. Go date someone from the Air Force Academy that cares about flying planes and piolot training, you fucking asshole. 

And yes, I care that your family hates me because family is important to me! It may not be on your list of what you want in a partner, but it's on mine. I don't want to marry into your psychotic family. And no, I don't usually think about the future, but that's one thing I have thought about and I don't want to deal with your dad and grandma every Christmas&nbsp;and Thanksgiving. I don't deserve all the shit they said to me and I think you're an ass for still talking to them like nothing happened. I want a boyfriend with a family that I fit into. I can't relate to anyone in your family! That's why I HATE hanging out with them on holidays and driving with them to pick your ass up from the train station. I want a second mom, not one I dread spending time with. Is that too much to ask? I'm sorry you can't change that, but I just can't marry into a family like that. And yes, I think my mom is absolutely right: I'm not just marrying you, I'm marrying your family too and all the shit that goes with it. Now would that really make me happy? 

Aside from marriage, there are things you just don't understand about me anymore. You think working out and looking good is going to make me happy? You think giving me an orgasm and pleasuring me in bed will make me happy? And let's not forget you think money will make me happy... US happy. You just don't understand. I don't need all that. I need someone to make me laugh. I need someone emotionally stronger than myself so&nbsp;when I get sad you are there for me, not crying hysterically thinking I'm going to make you feel better. You are so depressing. ALL the fucking time. ""I miss you. I love you. I want you. I need you."" God if you are that fucking crazy about me what the hell are you doing out there? Stop complaining that you miss me if you love being out there. I don't care if you quit and I don't care if you stay, but stop talking to me as if you are going to come home. Stop ""thinking"" of a solution for the problem if there isn't one. You are so fucking stupid sometimes, I wonder how you even made it into that damn place. Well this is it. You will probably hear this at some point and I'm sorry for the brutal truth, but maybe you feel the same on some points I brought up. I don't know at this point if we are breaking up or going to work this out, but after reading/ hearing this you probably won't want to be with me anyhow. I'll think about if I will care later."

like a wound
but never healed
remembering
the once forgotten
everything
felt real

like a single rose
it will sufficate
and slowly die
left lost
and alone
tearing me up
inside

gone
but not over
not yet
like a book
lying unread
there is still 
so much left

thrown away
pounding down
like rain
the storm
is just beginning
but im still here
hoping and waiting"

With the lies they told to you
And the least they ever gave you
Was the most you ever knew

And I wonder where these dreams go
When the world gets in your way
What's the point in all this screaming
No one's listening anyway

Your voice is small and fading
And you hide in here unknown
And your mother loves your father
Cause she's got nowhere to go 

And she wonders where these dreams go
Cause the world got in her way
What's the point in ever trying
Nothing's changing anyway 

They press their lips against you
And you love the lies they say
And I tried so hard to reach you
But you're falling anyway

You'll never take that away

So expect me to be 
Calling you to see

Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping or you're dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me

I thought that the world had lost it's sway
It's so hard sometimes
Then I fell in love with you
Then came you
And you took that away
It's not so difficult
The world is not so difficult
You take away the old
Show me the new
And I feel like I can fly when i stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
A hundred miles from home
I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you

"event","ok i dont take back what i said about valentines day but this one was awesome. Marcus got me a rose and a teddy bear. Its soo cute!! by far the best vday ever! i wrote him a poem, baked him cookies, got him chocolate, and made him a card cuz i didnt want to give the card companies any profit. everyone said the poem was really sweet, i liked it and i think he did too. i love writing poems. i think i can express myself way better on paper than out loud."

"event","grrr i didnt do so well on my math test, maybe im just stupid and im trying to blame it on a teacher. i dunno... hopefully it just takes time. last night was so awesome! i love brian regan! hes hilarious. the show was great, he came back out when everyone stood up and clapped. i loved it! sooo valentines day tomorrow... i really dont like valentines day. i think its for the card companies because no one bought cards in between new years and easter so they just threw in another holiday to make more money. then again ive never had a boyfriend on valentines so maybe he will change that. well not much else to report... oh by the way my hand hurts in the shower, thanks a lot codey!"

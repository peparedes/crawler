"event","WOW The Starting Line was amazing in conert!! They deftently blew out Y/C lol i dun't care what any one says TSL was much much much better....!!  Well first off we got to the palladium round 4 i think...O mann we saw Kenny and Matt (from starting line) just walkin around out side....then these two girls becky, and isabeal came and we talked with them, ended up hanging out with them the whole time, they were pretty cool kids.  Got into the place...lol i ran got my T-shirt and then ran to the front...i was so happy i got right up in front for TSL!!!  jackie and lisa ended up leaving before TSL played, so it was me becky and isabeal, in the front.  It was so hot there was no one in my way! the two openin bands played...then i saw kenny in the back while they were setting up, he looked right at me and i waved and he smiled and waved back ....then They came on stage and werre just AMAMZING!! They played my fav song ""bedroom talk""  kenny said beofre they began the song ""this song is about sex"" which..is obvious haha, the guiteriest of TSl we kept singin to each other lol thats why its aplus to be in the front!! Then at the end Kenny through his guitar pick and yes i actully cought it@!! i got Kenny autograph too woohoo!! (thanks jackielol) Then Y/C came on, they played sooo many old songs (THANK GOD) they played Finish line!!! Ben from YC was so cool at one point i was zoning out..and wasn;'t really smiling so he was pointing at me and was makin smilying faces... then to make sure it was me i pointed to myself haah and he was like ""yes"" and then smiled agian and i smiled bvack it was hot!!! I got such a good view of the bands and band members when they came over and stood on the speacker b/c i was right in front of the speakers!! It was an awsome concert!  TSL was GREATTT!! they need to come back!

We got to the floor and we got right up at the fecnce in the front.  Sugarcult satrted and it was so cool cuz we were so close to them...but that only lasted two songs....b/c i was right up agianst the railing.....and i was getting smushed and i could barley breath lol so jackie was behind me trying to not have people kill me...so after the second song we just backed up a little bit.  Then NFG came on after them and it was our 3 time seeing them, their intro was awsome...but not nearly as good as Green Day!  NFG finseshd and then we got some drinks and came back to the pit for Green Day.  Oh mann they came on and it was SOOO GOOD!!!! i can't believe how good green day is in concert they keep the crowd entertained adn everything... iT was funny when the lead signer billy joe was felling himsefl up haha and then we sung ""we are the champions"" cuz we had won the wrold series!  They played basket case (of coarse) and they started with American Idiot.  ( haha lisa 'Do the papiganda"")  And then ended with Minority.   It is hands down the best show i have been to.... Lol lkisa the conffetti went all down my shirt lol"

Is hard to hide behind your lies
And I'm locked in my hotel room 
Turning over our goodbyes

I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it

Another lonely night in Amsterdam
The water's moving through the sound
The blood is boiling in my veins
and the food I can't keep down

And I don't care if you don't love me
And I don't care if you don't change
And I could live inside the shadow that I cast for you
If it meant that you would stay
And I'll be home before the morning comes,
You won't have to be alone

So I fall 
I don't wanna feel this small 
You know I just can't handle this 
Handle this at all 
And I'll just fall 
I'll let my heartbeat drop 
I falter as the music stops 
And you watch me as stall 
And wonder when I fall 

I kiss your neck 
I feel you breathing on my shoulder 
Still I'm perfect 
It must be you cause now it's over 
I was so close 
That was the most that I have ever been through 
Now old cassettes and cigarettes 
Will be the ones to save you 
How can you ask for me to stay 
When all you ever do is go? 
Just go 

And so I fall

So you wrote it down 
I'm supposed to care
Even though it's never there
Sorry if I'm not prepared
Is it hard to see the things you substitute
For me and all my thoughts of you
It's eating me alive to leave you

Maybe it's childish and maybe it's wrong
But so is your blank stare in lieu of this song
Maybe it's childish and maybe it's wrong

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be wrong
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song

I'm breathing in your skin tonight
Quiet is my loudest cry
Wouldn't wanna wake the eyes that make me melt inside
And if it's healthier to leave you be
may a sickness come and set me free
Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me

I'm finding my own words, my own little stage
my own epic drama, my own scripted page
I'll send you the rough draft, I'll seal it with tears
Maybe you'll read it and I'll reappear
From the start it was shaky and the characters rash,
A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last
All I have deep inside, to overcome this desire
are friendly intentions and fair-weather smiles"

Then heading of to find volcom stage we saw Josh and Steve, gave them a wave. After that we walked around checking out the booths they had.  After that we headed over to the stage too see ""FINCH"" AWWWWSSSSOOOOOOMMMMEEEE!!!!  they were so good your really close to the stage, so it was great @ the end of finch jackie and lisa lfet cuz they were getting hot or somthing...but me and danielle stayed to Mosh to ""What it is to burn"" a great song.  After that we reliezed that Midtown was playing for 5 min. into Finch and we ran over to Midtown, they were soooo awsome, glad they got back together to start a new album.!! During midtown there was this hotty in front, its awsome cuz when u get pushed by people you rub up agianst them.  verry nice.  after midtown we went to find the midtown booth and we sucecded in finding it ^_^!  like an hr after of woundering around we headed back to the midtown booth, and the lead singer was there AHHH so hott ^_^!  We all went up he was really cool, he said hey to us and gave everyone a hand shack...but i wanted a hug lol so i asked for one and got a hug ^_^,  lol it was great i had a slushie and he asks ""what is that your eating?"" and i repiled ""O, a slushie do you want some?"" and he saud ""yes"" so now techtinly...i've been in his mouth and have his germs. after chatting with him for awhile i asked for a picture and his autograph he was So cool!!! Adfter that we headed out agian, for some more woundering and ended up coming back to the midtown booth cuz they had signing @ 4 pm.  so i got up and got the whole bands autograph and picture. It was cool cuz the lead singer of midtown remereind me ^_^  when I came back!!! woohoo! At the Something Corporate booth i met brian and Josh, at diff. times.  Jackie asked brian what happened to will, and we finally solved that mystery.  I guess he just wanted to do his own thing and he is right now, but they are all still really good friends and all that.  After that we saw New Found Glory, they were cool. I got a new found glory guitar pick ^_^! then we woundered some more, after NFG and we sat on this huge blow up couch to watch MxPx. Oh man Good charlotte was there...but we went to go adn watch the pro skate boarders instead.  After that we saw Less than jake Which was AWSOME!!!!  there mosh pits were so great the crowd was awsome and right after less than jake it was straight to Something Corporate.  and then there was no one else good so we decided to leave.  and that was my day @ warped tour...it kicked ass!"

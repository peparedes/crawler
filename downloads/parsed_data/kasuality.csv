"event","i just updated my journal and it didn't post.  motherfuckers...  anyway, i'll try to reconstruct.

i spent the weekend at my parents place and took full advantage of use of a real piano to learn some satie pieces.  i have since developed a full blown obsession with the man and his music.  upon returning to new haven, i immediately bought a book of pieces and came home to play them on my old synth.  only, when you play large clusters of notes, the tuning kind of warps and certain keys produce statis-like noises.  as amusing as it is to hear the music through various mechanized tones, i have a sudden longing to a return to playing/writing for purely orchestral instruments which, under the spell of sensitive and skilled hands (unlike my own), create sounds far more sublime than any machine can produce.  

beyond that, i've been struggling lately for a direction in my musical endeavors and have considered, among other things, abandoning my delusions of getting and keeping a ""rock"" band together in favor of composing in a more classical sense.  so discovering the magic of satie through actual playing is as much cathartic as it is discouraging.  it's like listening to your favorite band and being inspired but simultaneously realizing that they have already created exactly what you envision creating yourself and that they probably do it much better than you ever could.

but i guess it's best not to question these things.  sometimes it's necessary to step outside of yourself, your own desires and ideas and, in a sense, become a student again.  absorb, expand, filter, and release."

"event","overcast wednesday morning.  i take a trip to get ink cartridges for my printer.  on the way, after a brief tug of war with my consumer conscience, i give in and pull into the new dunkin' donuts on whalley ave for a quick fix of caffeine and carbs.  then the gods hand me my sentence.  in an attempt to cross the oncoming traffic to make a left turn, a suburban lets me through but, blocks my view of the next lane and I smack into another car.  technically, my fault.  i'll take the blame.  then the responding officer tells me i can wait in my car since it's going to rain, to which i reply, ""well, it can't get any worse"".  he chuckles, then goes to shut the door to his car and hits me with it accidentally.  he says, ""i guess it can"".  he lets me off with a verbal warning instead of a $100 fine.  thank god because i don't even have the money to cover my deductible for the repairs.  to top it off, i get back in my car to return home and take out the bagel i got and they screwed up my order and put cream cheese on it.  not to mention the fact that i'm covered in poison ivy and barely have the money to treat that, nevermind the deductible i have to pay on repairs to my car.  

in short:
a bagel i couldn't eat: $1.00
a trashed front end: $500.00
poison ivy medications: $5.00 a pop
mounting credit card debt: priceless"

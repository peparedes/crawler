There are no words.

God.  Sometimes, you just feel so, SO lucky - regardless of mean reds - to have LIFE.  I just want to laugh, or cry, or dance, or SOMETHING, all at once....so I'm going to do the next best thing, and celebrate with good friends, good food, and good times. :)  Party's here tonight.

Other details: I can also start getting off the anti-seizure meds!  Starting now, my dose for the next two weeks is cut in half!  Also, I don't have to have another MRI for another YEAR!!!  A YEAR!!!  WOO!!

But, party calls!  BYEEEEEEEE!!!! :D  

Perhaps more philosophical later, but prob not, have million distractions and mind is going EVERYWHERE!!!"

Heheeeeeeeeeeee...!  

So I'm pretty happy girl right now. :)

Okay, so I got my ahir cut and I LOVE it!!  SO CUTE!  Melikes.  I went to see Ramona, who gave me my AMAZING haircut last summer, and she did it again!  Two for two!

Then it was lentil soup and foccacia bread with Dan, and looking at these AMAZING pictures I got developed randomly...and they were from SOPHOMORE YEAR of college.  FREAKING SOPHOMORE YEARA!!!!  There were some at Christina's house, and a TON from Dan's birthday, including one of me smoking his Cuban cigar and looking quite evil....muaha!

AND THEN IT WAS GOOD TIMES WITH THE BOYS.  The boys being: Dan, Kubby, Haas, Andrew, Mark O'Donnell, and even Dekeyser!  WHOAH!!!!!  Hahaha....I'm a little tipsy happy girl right now. :)  So happy.  Started out at the Firehosue Pub, where I had my first every Amaretto Stone Sour, and it was TASTY.  TASTY.  And I saw Fat Jared!  So had to say hello.  Then we migrated to the Whiffle Tree, where Dekeyser bought me a rum&coke (why's that kid my new best friend?), and we made plans to party this fall: next time a hurricane threatens Toulane, he's coming to U of I and we're going to Bros, where he's buying nme another drink in exchange for a dance. :)  I'll TAKE IT.  And Andrew's going to teach me how to play the guitar this year.  And something else.  There was something else cool about the Whiffle Tree...OH YEAH!  Andrew's going to come with when my dad takes me to the Tree for a beer like he keeps saying he's going to!  ROCK.

"event","Last night I dreamed Record Service was open.  Again.  I had been at a class, and was walking home (in a semi-short, white, fluffy-ruffly skirt, I have to add) down Green Street, but when I went to walk past RS, so used to it being dark and empty, the windows dusty and blind...I stopped in shock: the lights were on inside, and there were people inside!  I saw Dean first, and tried to throw the door open, run inside.  But it was still locked.  But after a moment, he let me in.  And while it felt different - I knew somehow, that this was not my store - it still looked the same, smelled the same...even the floor felt the same to my feet, straight through my shoes and to my heart.  I immediately jumped behind the counter - though afraid that I no longer belonged there, I asked Dean if I could stay and help - and began ringing up sales.  After a moment, Phil came downstairs, looking more haggard than he ever did while the store was actually open - he looked as if he hadn't shaved in days - but happier.  ""Are we open again?""  I asked.  ""Barely,"" he answered.  ""Can I have my job?""  ""Of course,"" he answered, with a smile that made me know everything was going to be okay this time.

But then I wake up...and realize that there is no more Record Service to go home to...because it WAS a home...even when I couldn't go ""home"" (aka the apartment) for whatever reason...I always had RS.  It's at these moments that a giant pit opens deep in my gut, and I realize what a space has opened.  What new home will fill this hole, and when will I find it?

And on the subject of dreams...I think I may have stumbled serendipitously onto an answer to why my dreams have been so incredibly vivid since the surgery.  I've always had v. real dreams, but post-surgery, they've been SCARILY vivid.  Ran across an article in Newsweek last week about the science of dreams: ""People often deal with traumatic events through dreams.  Tufts University psychiatrist Ernest Hartmann....found that the later dreams [after the event] were not necessarily more negative, but they were more intense. 'The intensity is a measure of emotional arousal,' he says.""  And I thought that it actually might have had a biological explanation, like my medicine, or even my brain itself (who KNOWS what else they might've affected playing around up there), but it's really just a common sense thing...huh.  Funny how that works. :)"

"event","Ahhh...so it was just one of those days, good from start to finish. :)  Went to see Dennis in Chicago (since he drove all the way up HERE last Sunday to surprise-visit me, which didn't work, since I wasn't HERE!!), and we had the absolute perfect day for it...sunny and warm and breezy and just gorgeous!

I hadn't seen him since May (though there have been phone calls/LOTS of letters), so that was amazing in itself.  I couldn't believe it - he even LOOKED more adult since I'd last seen him.  He said it's something about having more confidence. :)  (I think it's the raise he just got. *wink*)  I just had a stupid silly grin on my face all day, from the first moment I saw him waiting for me at the doors of the train station. :D

And then he took me out for the best day on the town EVER.  Seriously.  Ever. :)  Went to lunch at this little Italian place in his neighborhood, then went back to see his apartment, and play with the kitten he's cat-sitting (CUUUUUTE!!!!  Kitten fuzz and giant ears and Buddha belly!!).  And then randomly, we decide to go to the Lincoln Park Zoo. :)  Best idea of the day. :)  We saw almost the whole zoo, etc, etc, but the best part?  The carousel!!  We must have looked like such dorks - the oldest kids out there, laughing hysterically, ""racing"" our animals (my cheetah kicked ass!) - but it was just amazing.   (And Michelle: all those horseback-riding lessons really came to my rescue when it came to mounting/dismounting the thing!!  *doublewink* Was so high!  How the hell do KIDS get on those things?!)  And then it was back to his apartment for the unveiling of....the Tessa Maye!!  And it's PINK!  He finally figured it out, and made it for me today.  So someday, when he opens his ubertrendy restaurant, you'll be able to order a Tessa Maye. :)  It's ""sweet, fizzy, and bubbly"" like me, he says.  A mix of champagne, limon cello, and rasberry liquer (or grenadine), with a garnish of a mint-stuffed (just for looks - don't eat!) rasberry.  And it's a blush drink, so it's darker pink at the bottom and light and fizzy at the top. :)  I loved it!  A little too much, I think....hehe!  And then dinner outside at a little pizzeria on one of the side streets of Michigan Ave.  All in all, an amazing day.  I just kept thinking, all day, how lucky I am to have such a friend.  Was sorry to leave at the end of the day, but glad I decided to take the late train home. ;)

Also v. cool: I remember when Champaign started to feel like home, and now, strangely, Chicago is.  I remember that moment when I realized I would just randomly run into people I knew EVERYwhere on campus, and that happened to me today...and how does that happen in such a huge city?  At the zoo, ran into Danny (Dennis's boss)...and then ran into Derek (of D-Lo and Spinnerty) on Mich Ave, and THEN (the craziest), sat down on the train, looked across the aisle, and there was Sach!!  Brett's roommate from freshmen year!  How small-world.  We had lots of catching up to do. :)

Damn, it was such a good day!!!"

"event","Today I was mowing the lawn, and when I turned the corner around the back path of the prairie, there in the center was a bright yellow balloon.  Out of nowhere.  It floated on the tip tops of the blades of grass, and didn't pop as I passed it, only breezed to the side, whisked along by the gust of wind and pungent shards of new newly mown grass exhaled by the mower blades.  Each lap I made of the prairie, the yellow balloon greeted me.  Where did you come from?  (Perfect moment of magic in my day *smile*)

On a completely different note, why I'm still friends with Dan:

""So I've heard YOU talk about it, and Cone say things, and other people, too, but this is the first time I've actually SEEN it.  I mean, you don't treat your friends like that.  They say something stupid, you laugh anyway, or you tease.  But she was just MEAN.""

I LOVE IT!  LOVE IT when art has so much LIFE!  Made for a happy Tessa. :)

Also hit up A Room of One's Own, the feminist bookstore - Ross will be so happy to hear that I went.  He's been after me for years to get out there. :)  Though I found it REALLY ironic that they had copies of Bill Clinton's last...yikes.

I don't know how I feel about this.  It's strangely surreal.  Another one.  I remember when I heard about the last (the third), I wondered, ""Who's next?""  Morbid, maybe, but so much death in so little time tends to lend itself to darker thoughts...

I can't help wondering if it was drug-related.  Last I knew, he was into some pretty heavy traffic.

And while it's sad, tragic even, that he was so young, and while I feel for his family and friends...I have to be honest: he wasn't a good person, last I knew.  He was cruel.  He was shallow.  He abused himself, and those around him.  My dad offered to accompany me to the service, but I have no place going."

He's also going to Dr. Alexander (my neurosurgeon), and John called to ask if I would mind talking to his friend, who's pretty nervous about the whole thing (understandably so).

It's just weird: not that long ago, *I* was the one on that side, and people were more than willing to answer any questions I may have had.  ""You should really talk to Sharon, she had a brain tumor removed ten years ago, and she's been doing really well...""  ""When I had a tumor in my chest removed...""  ""My cousin's friend's brother's dog...""  You get the idea.  But.  I didn't WANT to talk to anyone (with the exception of Iryce, who thinks the same way I do, and is just as stubborn/independent as I am).  I just wanted to be a normal girl.  

And now I'm on the flip side.  I'M the experienced one.  I'm just glad it means I'm past the surgery. :)  Although, thinking about it now, this is something that I'll never be completely ""past,"" I guess.  There will always be MRIs and that shadow of fear that accompanies me to the doctor's office; there will always be this intensified attention to my diet, attention to tumor-inhibiting foods, if they truly exist; there will always be the dank memory of last year skulking somewhere beneath the brighter, lighter times.

Aaaaaaand GO:

Started out by visiting Mish at her aunt and uncle's lakehouse on Wonder Lake: was awesome!!  Went out on the boat (I got to be spotter!) when Mish and her Uncle Jay skiied, and then we went swimming with her younger cousins Brooke and Scott, and then we went in the hot tub (FEET JETS!!!  ROCK.), and then there was grilling out and lots and LOTS of yummy fruit!, and then more skiing, and then Mish and I headed back to her house to rescue my phone, and then to Woodfield (where I spent waaaay too much on jeans, a Limited ""Perfect Shirt"" [and it really IS!!], a Carrie Bradshaw shirt [hehe!], and a skirt that's so short I have to hide it from my mother [has at least an inch on Coney's short skirt YIKES!]), and then to the Cheesecake Factory, and then BACK to Mish's house for some good SATC and better conversation.  Now I'm convinced.  This year?  Going to be a good year. :)

She asked me what my highlight of the day was, and though it was ALL good (even the train being 20 minutes late was somehow good!), I did manage to pick one. :)  It was def going out on the boat for the first time, waiting for a moment, bobbing on the water while Mish got into the water with her ski, and then when she was ready, taking off with such force that I nearly fell off the seat, and then skimming along the surface of the lake, rocking with the waves that crashed against the bottom of the boat (was a little rough for skiing), and whipping down the lake with the wind whooshing past until we turned around at such at angle that I briefly wondered if I could fall out.  It made me feel like standing up and spreading out my arms and laughing and singing and maybe even flying.  It wouldn't have surprised me if I could've right then. :)  And next summer, I'LL ski. :D

And I'm going to drool over the things that WOULD prettify my apartment, but that I refuse to buy, as am going to Woodfield with Mish tomorrow. >:)

Mmm...last night?  Success, but not in the way I thought it would be...what was going to be Chris, Ben, Scott, Scott's brother Steve, Lil' Bro, Jen after work, possibly Kari, and I hoped Cone (if she got home and got my message and felt up for some hijinx), and what I spent cleaning my house for three hours for, turned out to be Chris, Ben (aka Donovan, aka Donnie, aka D haha), and I.  Went to the OG, where Ben found his soulmate (or the scary semi-skanky hostess), and I got a BOWL of sangria--was freaking enormous!  And there was interpretive dance, compliments Ben, and friendly nips on the shoulder, compliments me (I TOLD YOU I BITE, CHIP!! Ha!).  And awesome Season 5 Buffy!  And ice cream, and ""tea"" (Ben, you sicko!), and SPIDER!!!  

And later that night, after everyone had gone, I returned to my box-o-words after a long absence.  The result?  Maybe not scrap poetry, but a maxim at least: ""You grew up. / Now go live your life.""  So true, so true. 

And there were more strange dreams...was going to a family reunion at Best Buy.  And Chris and Ben were there, leaving as I was coming, and we passed by each other at the doors.  Ben shook my hand, and Chris did so, too, saying as held my hand: ""I'll be back later.  Soon.""  But I instinctively knew he wouldn't be, and as he turned to walk away, I didn't let go right away, forcing him to turn and look back quickly before his fingers slipped completely from mine.  Then, it wasn't until I had actually walked into the building that I realized I knew no one at this family reunion.  It was supposedly my dad's side of the family, but I only knew my immediate family.  However, my mom told my brother and me that we could each pick out one CD and she would buy them for us, so I wasn't too concerned--now, at least, I was entertained.  I wanted the new Cure CD, and called Chris to find out which one it was: ""Georgia Peaches,"" he told me.  ""I knew that,"" I replied, and went to buy it.  The rest of the fam were buying their respective purchases, so I threw my CD in with their stuff.  Everything else was ringing up as LESS THAN A DOLLAR, but my CD was $62.  We attempted to argue, then just bought it anyway.  And then finally, finally went home.

One more, completely random, thing:  Does anyone need a bedroom set (double bed, two dressers, and mirror) for a few hundred dollars?  My neighbor is selling some of his mother's old things, so they're def antique.  Leave me a message if you or anyone you know is interested!"

Mish picked me up at the train station, and it was just AWESOME to see her!  She had a sign for me with my name on it.  Think it's a comment on how long it's been since we've seen each other? :)  Haha!  Was hilarious.  Yeah, and I def did the girl thing and screamed and hugged.  Not going to deny it.

And then it was off to meet The Other One (hehe!) at the Cheesecake Factory...MMMMMM for dinner&such!  And it was just a cacaphony of catching up!  I mean, at first, they asked me how I was feeling, etc, but then?  It was all boys/shopping/work/apartment shit/waterskiing/etc!!  AND THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE!!  It's not like they were trivializing my recovery or anything...but finally, FINALLY I'm starting to not only FEEL like, but be treated as a NORMAL GIRL again!!  (Sidenote: I think I'm almost forgetting...I mean, not REALLY forgetting...but I'm just not thinking about it as much.  Example: a copy of *Death Be Not Proud* came in with the bargain books at work today, and I thought about buying it, as it was only three dollars, but then I read the back, and saw it was a father's memoir about his son who died of a brain tumor at the age of 17...and I thought, ""maybe I'm not ready for this one yet,"" but then, it just seemed so SURREAL that I had gone through it, and I had to wonder if it was maybe all a dream...)

And then it was time for some shopping!  Okay, no shopping for ME, as have no money, but lots and lots of looking!  And playing with the massage chairs at Sharper Image.  Mish claims that one of those chairs will be her first big purchase, before a new car, before a house, before ANYthing.  And I got paid today...and thus, have a liiiiiittle money, and am visiting Mish again on Sunday, so maybe I'll come home with SOMEthing.

But really, it's just all about the going out and acting like a bunch of goofy girls. :)  It was seriously just all laughs and good catching up and no stupid drama.  It's such a relief to spend some time with normal people!

And honestly, it was the final element, I think, in making me ready to return to campus this fall.  I mean, I was really scared.  That place hosts a lot of bad memories, and I didn't want to go back just yet.  But now...after this visit and a few other recent events, I think I'll be ready. :)"

And more strange dreams, this time graced by Chip, Michelle, and possibly others... The dream itself had a burlesque quality...everything was a bit TOO colorful, and disporpotionate, even for a dream.  We worked for some kind of circus or theater, and lived there, too, in rooms far above the ring, so that we could always see whatever performance or preparation for was going on below.  I didn't like who I was in this dream.  I knew that what I was doing was wrong, and that I was playing games, but I enjoyed it (and I think Chip did, too, because there was def a little over-the-clothes straddling going on [our little secret]...).  But I knew I was going to hurt him.  This is what comes of combo boy drama--studies of the 1890s--reading *Cosmo* (our little secret) before bed.  Ha. ;)

AND Manet's parody of the cliche ""woman reading"" subject!) to prep for my 1890s class this fall.  BUT had all sorts of good serendipity, such as:  

After my mom and I had seen everything we specifically wanted to see, she told me to pick the next gallery.  I chose the modernist wing, because I wanted to ""visit"" Edward Hopper's *Nighthawks* (maybe a little cliche, but I still like it).  HOWEVER, that painting was on loan to the Tate (grr!)...BUT so much other goodness ensued, it didn't even matter!  :D First: ran into Ivan Albright's *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, which is his depiction of the corrupted portrait of Dorian from Oscar Wilde's novel, which is PERFECT for my 1890s class, and thinking about how the 1890s have continued to play a part in cultural imagination.  And THEN...I found.....PIERRE BONNARD!  Probably my mom's favorite painter.  Every time she's been to the Institute, she's asked if they have any Bonnard on exhibit, and they never do...until today, and they had THREE, including one she'd NEVER SEEN!!  Ever!  So of course, I grabbed her, hauled her out of whatever gallery she was still wandering around in, and planted her right in front of the Bonnard.  And she didn't move.  For the rest of the visit.  I took my time in the other galleries, just letting her have her moment with Bonnard, soaking it in.  Makes for happy mother. :)

THEN.  In the American wing, came across De Scott Evans *The Irish Question*...a painting that never meant too much to me until AFTER all of the work I've done with Bram Stoker and James Joyce.  What a dark sense of humor Evans has got to have.  Must email Valente about this one!!

And there's more.  This is just stupid, really.  Found a postcard book of the *Book of Kells* in the giftshop. :)  Hehe!  LURVE Celtic mythology/religion.  And it was cheap.  Looks like Dover Pubs can actually do something I approve of. ;)  Cause usually, they're just cheap 'n' ugly.

And I think that's it...

The only disappointment of the day was visiting the Terra Museum.  I was really exhausted by the time we got over there, so I couldn't fully absorb much of anything...and it's sad, because they're closing.  Probably in October.  So everyone, GO TO THE TERRA!  MICHIGAN AVENUE!  GO!!

Random, and completely off-topic: after talking with Chris last night, I unearthed that blank book that I had people write in at the end of senior year, right before graduation.  And...okay.  Not going to write about it here, and now.  Just for now, will leave it at a special thanks to Michelle. :)  Expect to hear from me soon."

Had scary dreams again last night.  The nightmares are coming back.  There was a party.  And someone was after me.  To kill me.  But they hit Ben instead.  I thought he was dead.  They took him away.  But he came back, he was okay.  Just very pale, so pale.  But I went and sat with him, and held his hand.  And Cara and I were friends, and designing some kind of logo thing for some kind of company, and the business man was really scary, and he was after us, too...There was just no safe haven at all.  And the room was full of mud.  And it was pink.  Pink walls, pink furniture--EVERYTHING.  And Michelle was back from Ohio.  And we were all at my grandma's house, for some reason...only it wasn't her actual house.  And I can't remember how it ends, because Dan called.  Maybe that's a good thing, because we all had to leave my grandma's, and I remember being afraid that the man who was trying to get me (he was like Mish's friend, Brad, only not) was outside.  He was going to get me.

Seriously, talking to Bauer last night, I was so happy/missed everyone so much, I just wanted to cry, or run around the room laughing, or SOMETHING.  I miss everyone SO MUCH.  We'll have to figure out some way of all getting together now that we don't have RS anymore...

But.  Any doubts about the weekend?  GONE. :D  GOING TO ROCK.

AND!!!! Andandand!  Talked to my doctor yesterday, and.....I CAN RUN!!!  !!!  !!  They had originally said ""end of summer"" because of the swelling in my brain, etc, but I've been having an amazing recovery (twice as fast as they had originally thought; plus, NO seizures at all!), so they said to go ahead!  Start out slow, but go ahead!  I CAN RUN!!!  I really DID run around the room when I heard that... ;)

OK, and so I had a dream last night that the tumor came back, but I'm going to disregard that; have had  lot of other things on my mind, probably just giving me restless dreams.  Because I also had a dream that I had to sell my books to pay for rent&food&such, and while I was doing that, someone broke into my apt and stole stuff (including, for some reason, my alarm clock and my old retainer...weird).

"event","After being way too excited for way too long (seriously, it was one of the few things I had to think about in the GOBS of time I had right after surgery when all I could do was lie there in the half dark and THINK) about the visit to Champaign, now I'm not entirely sure if I want to go.  Orignally, it was going to be Cone, Cara (to visit Kari Kristan), and I, but it kept getting put off (""Oh, I'm not sure if that weekend works...maybe this weekend...I don't know if my mom will let me...I think I'm going to be out of town,"" etc), so I kind of really got the idea that they didn't want to go.  But Kari and I were talking about how I'll have time to visit HER at school this spring since I'm finishing a semester early, and how she should visit ME this fall, when suddenly, I was like ""DURR, WE should go!!""  So the trip was back on!  This makes for a happy Tessa!

But then, Kari got suckered into dog-sitting, plus, family from California is going to be in town, so now she can't exactly get away for the weekend.  So now I'm riding down with Dan and Andrew (which will still be loads of fun, but in a different way; for example: this means no two-volume ""Kari&Tessa's Big Road Trip"" soundtrack), and now I don't know WHAT Chip and I are going to do to entertain ourselves.  I called him last night to tell him about the change of plans, and he's like: ""Uhh...so what do you want to do now?  'Cause I don't know.""  And it's true.  Half of what we had planned on doing is totally worthless without Kari. :(

But I'm sure that we'll figure SOMEthing out.  I mean, Chip's pretty entertaining all in himself.  And we all know I have fun almost anywhere I go. ;)  Plus, he still wants to watch BJD, and I still have to force Andrew to watch it...and he's making cheesecake still...and we're still hitting up Murphy's...and maybe this will give me a chance to grab some one-on-one time with Zack and really get to the bottom of things...and I'll still get to see Bauer, which reminds me, must go call him and see if he can get Jek in town for the weekend!!

Besides, I can always make a ""Dan&Andrew&Tessa's Big Road Trip"" soundtrack.... >:)"

Today, the following happened...

1)  Woke up, and the cold that has plagued me all weekend has not gone away...thus gross juicy sinuses MMM...
2)  After being awake for half an hour, received phone call from landlord stating that we still owe $2500 from Christina's share of rent on 101 East Green...
3)  Was denied more hours at work because budget is so bad, so have no clue as how to PAY for $2500, let alone for my OWN rent and bills and food this year...
4)  Was hit on by 29-year-old divorcee who's into fetish photography and writing love poetry (""I've been burned before, but someday, I'll find someone who appreciates my poetry""....""Want to hang out sometime?"") at work...

...and I still thought to myself, ""Damn, my life ROCKS!""  :D

1)  Got copy of Alfred Jarry's *Ubu Roi* through interlibrary loan today--should be scaaaaandalous! :)
2)  Another visit from Chris!
3)  Rollerblading, smoothies, etc with Kari tomorrow!

"event","Sometimes I feel like a normal girl again, like nothing has changed, like the last year never happened...and then I realize I should've taken my Depacote three and a half hours ago, or my dad tries to feed me flaxseed because it inhibits tumor growth, or I have to ask for a ride AGAIN...and it all comes rushing back.

Sometimes my dreams are so powerful that I wake up and have forgotten that the last year has happened...like this morning...last night I dreamed about Christina, and nothing had changed.  We were at her house, and it felt the same, it looked the same, it smelled the same, the light was the same.  And WE were the same...the most important part.  I think it was her birthday party, and I was the last to leave.

Sometimes I wonder if I really COULD forget it all.  At the end of the year, when Mish told me that Chip had thought about giving me ""post brain surgery kitty"" at the start of the fall semester, instead of before my surgery, I told her: ""I'm glad he gave it to me now--at that point, I'm sure I'll be trying to forget it ever happened and won't want any reminders.""  But now I know I can't do that.  This is something that has changed me fundamentally.  I've grown by this, and it's not a bad thing.  I've grown up.  A lot.  And though my dreams have not caught up, I know things are not the same.  I don't fit with the people I used to, or even with myself the way I used to be.  Because when someone tells you, ""I'm afraid we have some disturbing news for you [and that's a direct quote].  We found a mass in your temporal lobe, what appears to be a tumor, or possibly a cyst,"" there are suddenly important things to worry about.

Not going to lie: last year was the darkest year of my life.  That may not say a lot, because I've always been someone who darkness never really touched, let alone penetrated such as this.  But now, I don't know that I would take it back.  Because things are GOOD now.  I don't let stupid petty things get to me.  I laugh a lot louder now.  I'd forgotten how much fun kissing can be.  I listen to music again.  I don't make up stupid excuses for not trying new things.  I'm not a workaholic anymore (though this fall will be the TRUE test of that).  I'm closer to my family, esp the little bro, though we've always been close.  That fear that choked me last year has gone now.  I can breathe again."

"event","So after a minor bit of drama yesterday, last night was awesome.  Just what a girl needs sometimes. :)

Because...yeah.  Dan stopped by.  After he asked me in not so many words if I had cheated on him at the end of our relationship (really, how crass--just the notion of it--as much as I was ready to end things, I could never have done that to him), and after I discovered WHY Cone has been giving me such shit about supposedly being ""materialistic"" (turns out Dan has been talking to her, and doesn't understand what ""it's the little things that count--you never did anything boyfriendly"" means [turns out he thought that meant taking me out all the time]), it was actually okay.  Just hanging out, talking and listening to CDs.  Until he wants to listen to a CD that he burned for me eons ago (nothing romantic, but still).  He REALLY wants to listen to it, because he hadn't heard it since he burned it for me...so I offer to burn a copy for him...but we have to listen to it anyway.  And...I don't know...I guess it was still okay for awhile.  Talked about what's going on at work for a bit (which I'm semi-upset about), and comforting me, he touched my shoulder, where my rash still hasn't quite healed yet and is still dry and...well, hideous...and it really got me.  Being so starved (still) for touch--and just for CLOSEness (because really, my Coney's just not one for hugs *snort*)--it was amazing that not only did he seem to understand that that was the best way to somehow say ""it's all going to be alright""; but that he would touch me where I felt so ugly, a place that was still so violated, so not MINE.  But it escalated, which was probably inevitable...with an attempt to pull me close, onto his lap and against his chest like he used to hold me (""Is this too awkward?""  ""Uh...Yeah.""  And he lets me go...), a few almost kisses.  This inertia is too much.  I need my space.  This isn't like before, when it was just a clean break, and so easy...but I guess Dan didn't do anything that would prevent us from becoming friends.  But I had to kick him out.  But for the rest of the afternoon...it was like I had forgotten what I wanted...his visit left me unsettled, like sand kicked up at the floor of a pond, at the darkest depth, where the sunlight won't penetrate.  So I did the easy thing and kicked him out.

My apologies for the lame pond analogy, but after last night on the lake, I've got water on the brain. :)  (Not literally, thank God.)  Chris took me up to Ben's grandma's lakehouse, and the four of us (Chris, Ben, Ben's sister Gigi, and I) took the boat out to see the fireworks over Green Lake.  At one point, sitting at the back of the boat, watching the fireworks explode over the lake and fade into embers, half listening to the music Gigi had picked out (they had turned it down by then--I don't even remember what exactly was playing, but it didn't seem important)...I realized that it was one of those moments in life that actually becomes a fiber of not WHO you are, not your experience...but something more, maybe WHAT you are.  I so wanted to lean over and whisper to Chris: ""Someday I'm going to write a story about this.""  Because someday (now that the seizures have gone and creativity&energy have come flooding back in), I probably will.  I'll write about the smaller fireworks that surrounded us, shooting out from the beaches spread before lakehouses with dark faces and lights winking in windows, glimmering at the edges of the globe that is the lake.  About the sea of boat lights that bobbed in the darkness all around us as we waited for the show, and the sparklers like fairies that seemed to dance on the shore with no bodies behind them.  About breathing in the clean laundry smell of Chris mingling with the quietly alive smell of the lake--a gentle blend of rain and fish and the lilly pads that were brown in the muted light--that was every so often punctured by a sharp gasp of engine exhaust, and later, with the pungent haze of fireworks smoke.  About watching the fireworks--bursts of color and light so bright it made me blink--explode to illuminate the haze around them and ripple across the lake in broken slashes of their former selves, to thunder across the lake and echo back to us after crashing against a wall of earth and trees behind us...  At one point, it just hit me."

It's like I'm too lazy to go into it all.  But I'm still gonna try. :)  Yeah, you know things are normal when you're back in the drama-rama again!


I: Champaign Drama
Yeah...so there was def the phone convo with Zack.  It was so weird...I'll admit it (begrudgingly): I called first.  God knows why, since I haven't talked to the kid in practically a year, and was def avoiding him like none other (for good reason).  I think it was because I was listening to that CD he burned for me, and so many songs were SO perfect, and SO what I needed to hear after recent events.  But I left a message (then immediately had one of those ""OhmyGodwhathaveIdone?"" moments), though I didn't expect him to call me back.  So what's weird: I'm writing about it, and he CALLS.  We talked for 20 minutes, caught up a bit, whatev.  I had the whole ""so I had brain surgery this summer"" shocker, and he had the whole ""I'm still stuck in Champaign"" ""shocker"" (not really).  But he may go to San Francisco (maybe by this fall?  bad mobile connection...), so yeah.  Don't know how I feel about that.  I feel like we're at a point where we could maybe (maybe) be friends again, but if he's leaving anyway...yeah.

II: Wall Drama
It needs to go away.  I don't understand why Christina can't just get over it.  I know that she has problems, but I've had some pretty serious things to deal with as well, and I have.  And if anyone has a ""right"" to be angry, shotgun: I'm the one who's had to pay (literally), and I'm the one who's had to do all the work (fliers, ads, word of mouth, etc) to try to FIND someone to replace her.  Basically, when she hasn't taken any responsibility for her OWN actions, I've had to.  And not by choice...landlords don't care who pays as long as SOMEone does...  Ironically, I'm the one who is still okay with her after everything (I know that she's gotten a bum deal here, too), and who doesn't care if we end up at the same social gatherings (oooh the HORROR!).  And really.  We SHOULD be able to play like adults.  It's not fair to our mutual friends, and it's not fair to us for her to continue to make drama over this.  It's not as though this is a personal insult; it's just a fact: she signed a lease; she failed to pay; I (nor Mish, nor Nicole) don't have the money to pay, especially now.  Turns out, brain surgery is expensive.  And then you can't work for over a month, and then when you finally CAN work, you can't automatically go back to the full time work you USED to handle...you go back starting at 4 hours a week...(But luckily, my dad has been AWESOME about this--he knows I'm really worried about covering rent [because tuition is taken care of woooo!!!!] and food and bills and stuff, and has reassured me that he'll help out if I need it.)  So if she wants to stay home, that's her own choice.  But I want to get on with my life and get out and have fun. :)

III: Somewhere in between...
I hope it's NOT drama, but I'm afraid it has the potential to be.  In all honesty, I'm afraid of another ""Nate"" (something I knew was an impossibility from the v. start with D...), but hopefully I'm proven wrong, because so far...no...can't write about this.  Will ruin it. 

IV:  Ahhhh... :)
Mmm...the last couple of nights?  Have left me in state of bliss, despite drama. :)  Who DOESN'T love Roscoepalooza and who DOESN'T love watching ""Titanic"" with the girls (because really, who else would watch it with you?)?  I love it that things are finally starting to feel normal again.  Can't help it.  Lurrrrve my friends. :)  Am a lucky, LUCKY girl.  I love the things that  don't surprise me anymore, that are comfortable like a favorite pair of jeans.  Like Cara, finding the largest glass in the cupboard (""You were holding out on me!"") for her milk glass (""I'll drink it all!""...""Noone doubts you,"" says Cone...and we didn't!).  Like Kari, whose life should be a musical. :)  Or Jen, who liked the feather boa WAAAAY too much.  And Cone on the floor with the puppy: ""Can I take her home with me?"" (How many times have I heard that from her about MY puppy?)  And Cone, Kari, and I cramming together on the couch for the big ""Titanic"" viewing...Cara and Jen in the armchairs on the sides, feet on the edges of the couch.  Like being home again.  Finally...it's been too long since I've felt at home anywhere, even in my own body (again--finally starting to feel normal hurrah!).  And I love the things that are new.  Like Chris's love for OingoBoingo...(seriously, one word or two? Asks the competent record store employee...former).  

So all in all?  Good times. :)  Even with the drama.  I'll take it all."

So here's the story. :)  I'm in a funk, because my back is all stiff (still is--my GOD am I in desperate need/want of some kind of deep muscle massage!) because as it turns out, my mattress, being from the 60s (no joke), is all saggy in the middle.  My dad's totally cool about it (""Let's go get a new one""), but my mom (being my mother) FREAKS OUT, telling me that a firm mattress would be WORSE for me (just because SHE doesn't like them: ""From my OWN personal experience""), etc, etc.  Seriously.  There is no winning with this woman.  She would have been pissed if I hadn't said anything, and if my dad and I had just gone and bought a new one, but she's pissed anyway, just because I want/need a new one.  Sidenote: I'm sleeping on the floor tonight.  Perhaps more out of pride than anything else, but still!

But.  AOL is FINALLY working...and waiting for me in my Inbox?  An email from one of my future profs about a class on the 1890s that I'm taking this fall.  And it sounds even better than I originally thought!!  Not only are we studying the literature (but still no reading list...grr!), but the pop culture, politics, etc!!  Including but not limited to some of my faves: Mary Cassat, Pierre Bonnard, Frank Lloyd Wright, Toulouse Lautrec (and I KNOW I didn't spell that one right...hmm...), and SO MANY MORE!!!  Which put a huge smile on my face.  And we're even going to talk a bit about *Dracula*!!  Which you KNOW gets me way too excited.  And I simply HAVE to go reread *The Picture of Dorian Gray.*  Plus, the prof recommends that we enjoy/endure ""Moulin Rouge.""  Mua ha. :)  Done and done.  And I skimmed over the list of people he sent it to, and my v. first roommate (the one that lasted three weeks and then had to move to IT because of her ""allergies""--ie, she wanted to be in a party building), whom I've actually had a couple of classes with since, is in the class, so that's cool, too.  Wow.  Sometimes it's amazing how an email can make or break you. ;)

And I hear my mother walking around (like a schlep, as usual) upstairs, which prob means she's coming to reclaim her computer, so I'm OUT of here.  Off for a walk! :)"

"event","Since I can't leave notes on Cara's LJ (or Michelle's, actually, though I tried to comment on the elfin artwork!--the eye in the profile needs to be closer to the bridge of the nose, but I *heart* the elfin ear!) thanks to combo ghetto Mac/AOL, I'm just going to respond here. :)  It wasn't rubbing alcohol!  Sheebus!!  OW.  I would never torture my nemesis like that. :)  It was hydrogen peroxide...which my mom always tortured ME with when I was a kid...but it doesn't really sting, I promise....mua ha.  But luckily Coney saved the day.  And: do I sense archetypal analysis/references to Todeschi's *Encyclopedia of Symbolism* in your drink/personality analysis?  I LURVE IT!!!

But for serious.  Who wants the definitive picture of their relationship with annoying/selfish ex on display, staring them down all night?  Or any momentos from prom?  Okay...that sounds really bitter.  Though I was for SURE bitter when I first broke up with the kid, I'd like to think I've grown out of that. ;) (Though Cone, perhaps, would argue, but only because she takes pleasure, by her own admission, in giving me shit.*wink*)  Wit all of this looking-through-old-pictures activity (with Cara, Kari, etc, and even by myself before I was up for too much social activity), I've come to the conclusion that even WITH all the Wall/Wall Extras drama (both self-inflicted and actual), we had a damn good time, and I don't think I would change anything (with the possibly exception of a few large things--you know who you are).  Our secret, but there are almost moments when I miss the kid--sure, I let him get away with way too much, but I learned--because we DID have good times.  And let's face it, if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have found MY school, and who KNOWS where I'd be then.  Certainly not hooked up with some of the professors/opportunities that I have been/will continue to be.  But he made me visit U of I, and the second I stepped foot on the Quad, I just KNEW.  So he did have a semi-large purpose in my life.  Ha.  This is what you get, Cara, for digging out/displaying all of these high school artifacts!  Semi-corny ramblings!

MMM...woke up WAY too AWAKE for only 6-ish hours of sleep.  Def got my second wind last night after my girls (to be pronounced with the same intonation as Cone's ""Aight!"") left, which is good, as had hour and a half phone call from Chris, which I think is reason woke up way too awake/in ubergood mood (ESP for 7:30...!)  I blame the placebo chocolate!!  Or maybe it was the tea...hmm.

And this is getting too long.  And possiBLY boring. >:)  (Sorry, couldn't resist! Mua ha!)"

"event","Two updates in one day?  Ludicrous, I know.  But maybe two short[er] entries are better than one uberlong one?  (That one's for you, Coney-love *wink*.)

But I had to update, because I'm redonk excited.  Spent large chunk of the morning working on my Fulbright application stuff, and it's just becoming more and more of a reality for me. :D  It just suddenly hit me: I'M GOING TO DO IT.  No lame ass excuses (especially any involving my mother), no inhibitions, no hesistance.  I'm going to do it. :)  I can taste it.  Watch out, world (literally!), I'm back!!  (Or as Dan once put it: ""You seem to get everything you want...why not try wanting the world?""  DONE.)

Side note: I decided against applying for the Gates Cambridge award because you had to either get a second bachelors or your masters.  And I'll already have degrees in BOTH of the subjects I want four year degrees in, and undergrad work just doesn't get that specific, and I don't want to get my masters abroad because all of the schools I'm looking at for my doctorate require that you get ALL of your graduate work done in one straight shot.  Besides, who wants to do that when they could spend a year researching WHATEVER THEY WANT?!?!?

And the Rhodes, I'm still not sure about...I mean, it's kind of the same set-up as the Gates Cambridge, but it has a bit more freedom...and it's frickin' OXFORD!!

Okay, okay; new subject. :)  There was much artistic creation today...while searching for my acrylics (still MIA, by the way; random note: in *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings*, Maya Angelou is slapped for using that expression because it is considered a form of taking the Lord's name in vain, as he is ""The Way""; and...DONE),  I DID find my old contact sheets from high school photography, and on them, LOTS and LOTS of photos that I SHOULD have developed, but didn't.  So today, to experiment, I scanned one sheet, and then picked out one really cool picture of Cara, enlarged it (which of course made it all blurry), and then tried to fix all the blurriness.  I still have some ideas for that: think I will try to scan it at a higher resolution.  Unless anyone can hook me up with a dark room (for serious!), because this is an amazing picture...it expresses a quiet, but powerful emotion.  She's not looking at the camera, but down, so that her eyelashes are nearly brushing against her cheeks; her knees are drawn up to her chest, and her head is down.  She almost seems as though she is merely resting--the way one of her arms is thrown back suggests that she lounges--but there is a beautifully pensive, almost a sad quality to the way she sits.  So you can understand why I want to develop it.  If I get access to a dark room, maybe I'll print one for Jeff, too. ;)  There are so many that I never had time to get to in high school when I HAD a dark room, so SO many.  I thought about just taking the negatives in somewhere to have them developed, but it's just not the SAME as creating the picture--where you will crop it, the contrast, the darkness, even where you want the focus to be--yourself, watching it come into existence,  breathing the chemicals, moving in the dark...it's organic and spiritual all at once.  (New Life Goal: when rich and famous, am buying self a dark room!!)

Then I tried sketching the picture of Cara, but I got the shakes...enough said.

And now I'm going to go eat some of the honeydew melon that my mom finally said I could slice up!!!  IT'S AMAZING! :D  (Way to heart = stomach.  Why am I a boy?)"

"event","So after the past two days, I think I can finally say that I'm starting to feel normal again.  Sure, I still had moments of that ""need a 'four hour nap' [patent rights: Cara&Jen *wink*] fatigue,"" and I'm REALLY out of shape/easily exhausted by too much physical activity, BUT I think my body has finally kicked back into normalcy, which then makes me FEEL like my old self again.  Hurrah! :D  I think a lot of it had to do with girls' night with Kari, and visiting Coney, and playing in the park with Kari (who is now my personal trainer: she TOTALLY kicked my ass yesterday, and promises to have me back in shape in NO time *grin*), and a trip to the mecca (aka Tar-jay) for red flip flops of COURSE!  And I finally broke out some of my art stuff (trust me, it's tricky to sketch/paint when you've got the shakes) last night.  Can't find my acrylics (that's what I get for cleaning my room two days before brain surgery!), but I DID find my watercolors, and all kinds of paper.  Finally, finally. :)  And hopefully Cone remembers (after the confusion @ the Kwik Mart the other day, I have my doubts *wink*), that we have plans this afternoon (maybe we can paint?), so I can continue with the normalcy!"

"event","So today has been one of those blissful mornings...

Even though the quantity of sleep still isn't good, the QUALITY was AMAZING.  I think (I hope!) the way-too-vivid nightmares have stopped, 'cause it was sweet dreams (or in the words of Kubby: ""dream sweet!"") all the way, including one in which I was driving!  DRIVING!! :)  But the last one, the one that I was dreaming right before I woke up was for sure the best, because I was closer with someone than I have been in a long LONG time (closer than I've been with ANYone in a long time; have not actually been this close with this specific person).  Physically closer (but not like THAT, you pervs!), and all the stupid headachy pain/stiffness/whatever was gone.  So that was awesome.  And I woke up just feeling all warm and peaceful and happy. :)  Not even the initial ""WHY am I up so early when I didn't sleey that well?!"" frustration could take the edge off.  I love it when the aura of a dream is so strong (and GOOD) that it can stick with you even after you're awake...and have BEEN awake...I'm still smiling, just remembering it--nono, BASKING in it. 

And it gets better.  Mom made French Toast with homemade cinnamon bread for breakfast today...totally atoning for driving me insane yesterday (there was going to be a post, but my internet connection was interrupted...yes, love AOL...and even better, was interrupted by a spectacularly bad phone call).  Yeah, so basically, she harasses me (literally, an all day thing) for writing/grammar advice for her MANY resumes, and then she doesn't TAKE IT!!  Example: she won't use semi-colons where she needs them instead of commas, because the semi-colons ""look funny.""  Awesome.  And then she washed the inside of my windows with ammonia.  AMMONIA.  Sheebus.  But this morning, favorite breakfast. :)  But...she might just be suckering me into going with her to the eye doctor today to pick out new glasses (the second excursion to pick out new glasses for Mom that I will have made now...she keeps changing her mind!), but whatever.  I'll take it. :)  Why, WHY is the way to my heart through my stomach?

And actually had conversation with Mom today without getting batshit insane annoyed.  Turns out, she's actually going to let me visit school this summer! Before, she was all ""I'll THINK about it""--she's SO overprotective/clingy.  My dad wanted to bring her up to Door County for a weekend to visit her aunt and uncle (they have 40 acres on Lake Michigan--it's GORGEOUS), and she didn't want to go because she wanted to ""spend as much time with the kids before they go to school.""  TWO DAYS.  I mean, seriously.  But he asked her, ""Don't you think the kids want a little space sometimes?""  So haha.  But she's actually going to let me go!  And stay with Chip, which also completely surprised me...because, you know (at least if you know my mother), BOY.  And she did kind of give me trouble with that one...but she relented when I told her that other girls were coming, too.  I WIN. :D  Have so much to look forward to!  Going to see Bauer!  Shadie!  Ross!  Maybe even Jek if he's in town!  And maybe the Fairy Village...Chris?  And KKK (God, that is SO weird to type, but you guys know who I mean!)  OMG, and for my fellow HHSers that are hopefully still going with, we HAVE to go see MARKO.  TRIPLE O!!!!  That's enough amusement for at least 4 days....and he's staying in the soon-to-be famous house that I did the ethnography on!  But it won't be the same without Kubby and his harem.  OMG we're going to have SUCH a good time. :D

Why, WHY has this been such a good day?!  And it's not even 10 am!

Yesterday was pretty good, too!  Except for one thing, aka the bad phone call I mentioned earlier...seriously, doctor has BAAAD communication skills.  So I had to call St. Anthony's to set up my MRI for the end of the summer, and they ask me all of the requisite questions, including, ""Do you have metal clips in your brain?""  And I'm like, ""Err...I don't THINK so...but let me call my neurosurgeon and ask...""  So I call, and they're like, ""Uh yeah, turns out you DO.""  Hey great, thanks for telling me BEFORE you put them in there, or even telling me AT ALL.  I mean, would they have told me if I hadn't have specifically asked?!

So that was semi-frustrating.  So to take out that frustration, I reorganized my entire CD book to make them all fit!  And they do!!  It's glorious!!! They're not v. well organized because I was running out of room by the end and had to go back and cram some other things together, BUT THEY ALL FIT!!!  Which means no more random loose CDs all over the place!  So satisfying.

AND.  Trudy from my bookstore called, and they DO have some hours for me NEXT WEEK!  At first, she had already made the schedule, so I couldn't start until the week after next, but then some hours opened up!  OK, only FOUR hours on ONE day...but still!  WORK!  BOOKS!  PEOPLE!  MONEY!  THE REAL WORLD!!!!! :D

Hey wait there's more!  Dad took me out to Chinese!!  It IS the end of the anti-inflammation diet!  I was hoping...

ANDANDAND I finally have voicemail!!  AND, turns out it wasn't my own stupidity that prevented me from setting it up: I went to the cellular store, and they never programmed it into my phone like they were supposed to!  But I don't care, because now I've got it!

Gah.  Turns out, my mother WAS just buttering me up.  She wants tutorials on my PC, because she's been working on a Mac for so many years that apparently she's forgotten how a PC works.  Grr.

Think I will shower instead.  She can't follow me there! >:)  HAHAHAHAHAHA!

Wait, one more: lots and lots of good email today!!  Lovelove good email!"

1)  Finding my fave red skivvies that have been MIA for a ludicrously long time!  Hurrah!

I felt like asking him, ""Have you ever SEEN me?""  I am NOT that big of a girl (or a drinker) to be able to handle that much...""one hit wonder,"" that's what they call me. ;)

8)  The mystery pizza...
9)  Dad promising to take me out for Chinese food for lunch tomorrow.  Does this mean the end of the anti-inflammation diet?  I THINK SOOOO! *grin*

"event","'cause it already is. (MMmmmmraz...kind of like MmmmmBop, only not.)

So apparently, I decided to write a novel today.

So first, the urrrrgh part of the day:

Had another appointment with the surgeon.  Seriously, these people need to work on their communication skills.  Basically, he explained what my future looks like.  ""This is a lifelong problem,"" says he, ""I mean, you'll have to follow this for the rest of your life."" OK, fine...but does he have to repeat it just about 14 times?  And when explaining different possibilities for the future (among them: the tumor could come back benign and I'll need radiation; it could not come back at all and I'll have no seizures; or it could not come back but I'll still have seizures and still need medication to control them) does he HAVE to repeat the last possibility, again, WAY too many times: ""It could come back malignant, and possibly even be fatal.""  I SPEAK ENGLISH.  This is NOT something someone wants repeated.  It's the sort of thing that sticks with you the first time.  V. anxiety-provoking; it's like, ""If I'm GOING to have a seizure, I'm going to do it right in front of you, jerk!""  He clearly doesn't know who he's working with. :)  I'm going to be FINE.  This thing is NOT going to come back.  Neither are the seizures.  (Plus, though at one point I kind of wanted to, I didn't cry haha!  Tough as nails.)

And the return of the Angela Chase mentality.  I'm just so sick of constantly being around my mom.  And this is nothing that I hold against her: I know that it's just because we've been in v. close quarters the past month, with me being an indoor kitty now (one for the Buffy fans *wink*).  She actually had some degree of separation anxiety last Monday when I went over to Cara's.  I mean, that's SICK.  She was talking about how weird it was to not have me home, especially since I was gone so LONG, since we'd been spending so much time together.  Sick.  I mean, maybe it's OK if I'm four, but not if I'm 21.  And there have def been fights.  Mostly because I feel like I'm wasting a lot of my time WAITING FOR HER.  My mom is the type of woman who is perpetually late (it's because she insists on doing random shit that can really WAIT before the IMPORTANT stuff; plus, she's just about the slowest person I know--it's like, just take action!!)...which is usually OK, until I'm dependent on her to drive me ANYwhere or even to do certain stuff around the house (like lifting heavier stuff), which then makes ME perpetually late or just unhappy.  I just need a break.

But the good...

The doc DID tell me I can go back to work!!  HURRAH!!!!  Next week!  So I called my bookstore IMMEDIATELY upon returning home.  Trudy doesn't think she can get me in as soon as next week (she already has the schedule made), but she can the week after!!! :D  She told me my books miss me, and I assured her that I missed them.  And you all know, I DO.  So HURRAH for that!!  I'm grinning just thinking about it.  PLUS I have books that I ordered waiting there for me, and now I'll be able to afford them!!

OK, so it's lame, but I watched Ferris Bueller's Day Off with the lil' bro last night (upside of being an indoor kitty: get to bond with the kid more), and you know the part where Ferris and Sloane kiss in front of the blue windows at the Art Institute?  Totally made me feel better about this whole break up with Dan.  Not that I was feeling terrible about it...I knew it was best for me; I knew he was holdin' me back.  But.  Doing it so recently after a major operation was maybe NOT smart.  Because I just feel hideous; I don't feel GOOD (all headachy and stiff and URGH the rash...and BAAAD hair haha), so therefore, I don't feel CUTE.  Vain?  Yes.  But still.  Who doesn't like to feel cute?  Plus, I was/sometimes still am feeling kind of cut off from all of my school friends, esp since I can't exactly jump up and go see them just yet.  And I don't quite feel like the girl I was before...not yet...so I guess I just don't feel quite as...I don't know...I don't want to say ""loveable,"" or ""wanted,"" because that's not quite right...but seriously, it's hard to feel damn sexy when your head hurts and your doctor has to go and poke at your scars anyway (OW, by the way).  But I saw that scene...and I just knew, everything's going to be ok.  It's already getting there; example: NO pain pills today (though probably one before bed).  And lovely Coney DID tell me the other day that I have nice eyes.  I'll take it. ;)  Why, WHY do I like her best for appealing to my vanity?  And watching that scene, I knew that I'd have that again someday.  It was just that stupid fear that I KNOW I've bitched about before: what if nothing better comes along?  Someone will (and you know where I'll take them haha).  It's stupid to hang on to a dead relationship/a person you don't feel that way about any more JUST for ""that.""  And suddenly I knew with all certainty: I did the right thing; it's all going to be alright (new theme of this entry!).

Also lame, but whatever: I hit Victoria's Secret's semi-annual sale to see if they put my fave style of knickers on sale, because what's better than underwear shopping to cheer a girl up after a crappy doctor's visit?  So, they DIDN'T have MINE on sale (but you know where I'm going with my first paycheck...the half that doesn't go in my savings account, anyway), but I did see something else that made me WAY too excited.  VS has a new fragrance, and it's called ....suspense... PINK.  OK, forget all of this recent ""pink is the new black"" shebazz; pink has ALWAYS been my color, dating back to the days when I was a baby and my mother nicknamed me ""Pinkie.""  I don't know how I feel about the scent itself...I like it, but I wasn't head over heels for it...but just the fact that there now exists a fragrance named for me (sort of) totally made up for the fact that they didn't include my fave knickers in their sale.

And finally.  Checked my email...and had an email from Ross.  About CARE Facilitation Orientation and practices.  And I realized that some things truly NEVER change.  And I thought about seeing everyone again, and I so desperately wanted to see them right THEN...so desperately it almost made me want to cry. (Almost.)  But just thinking about how this year is new, and that there are things to look forward to, and that I still have a home there...I KNEW.  I knew beyond a doubt, in my gut, that everything's going to be alright. :)  'Cause it already is.

Especially since my fingertips have stopped going numb. :D"

"event","So it's been a month since the surgery.  Hard to believe.

I have to be honest: I'm not as ""recovered"" as I hoped to be at this point.  The steroid withdrawal really set me back, I think.  And this whole last week really kicked my ass.  (Thus, taking today as a day of rest, esp as I have back-to-back fam get-togethers for Fathers' Day tomorrow.)  I'm just, well, SICK of being sick.  Because it's been more than just this last month...it started to get really bad just before Thanksgiving, with the gd seizures.  I mean, by Thanksgiving, I couldn't even EAT.  And we all know how much of (in the words of my mom) ""a foodie"" I am.    

Sometimes I feel as though I was really robbed this year.  It was supposed to be MY year: I had a full scholarship, a new apartment, great classes...and good hair haha!  But then there was the roommate who didn't move in and won't pay rent, which then led to money problems (at least for now), which then really took some of the edge off of that scholarship (but I was so SO lucky to get it, otherwise I would have been TOTALLY screwed); and then there were seizures.  It's amazing how quickly your life can change.  Last summer, again, in the immortal words of Frank (with a slight variation on verb tense): ""I had the world on a string.""  Maybe I didn't really, but I FELT like I did, and that's all that really counts.  But this summer.  Soon, though, soon.

I had planned on walking away from this completely and forgetting it ever happened, but I think I'm beginning to learn now that I can't do that.  This is a part of me now, for better or worse.  Builds character. ;)

But there were still good times this year.  So I can't say that I was robbed.  There was the waterski party on Homecoming; the best project ever, aka the ethnography of what I originally thought of as ""Kubby's Harem""; SATC with Nicole on the first night we were in the apartment; Quad Day, however illegal, with Joe and Holly (I win!); Halloween with Cara and Ben (WHY didn't we enter any contests?! We SO would've won!!); ANY real mail that came from Cara, esp. the Buffy envelope, the ""To Miss Tessa Oberg of the Red Room"" letter, and the Sunnydale High Yearbook; Mish's 21st birthday, aka The Party of the Century; Almost Famous/Orange Crush Party with Andrew; flirting with that cute police officer while a little tipsy and a little underage (and apparently, a little stupid); first visit from Ben, and kidnapping Sonic (whom I'm holding ransom, FYI, until I get Mrs. Dalloway back!!); Christmas break with Cone (DAMN that was some good green tea); Lost in Translation with Mish (sooo COLD...hey look there's Moonstruck!); pre-Mardi Gras weekend with Chip (best beads in the house!!); Mardi Gras with Mish, Chris and Ben; Buffy with Chris and Ben (Ben = soundtrack!); all of Conie's scary goth pictures; my pink feather boa (thanks, Ben!); MY 21st birthday (kiddie cocktails all the way, but special thanks to Kubby for making me stay til closing time); EVERY Friday afternoon at Record Service (esp. the day Jek rapped to me for an hour...lurrrrve Jek!...esp since he had good advice for me when my surgeon/parents confiscated the car keys: ""Driving's overrated."" [Jek's almost completely blind.]); even March 5th, a day of infamy in the life of Tessa, aka when RS closed...but it went out with a party and in high spirits (except, ok, it was the one time I cried this year; damn that place); same day: the Vagina Monologues with Dan and Caleb...because...random crowd!; also, the Dance Against AIDs Benefit with Dan, Caleb, and Heather, because HA how traumatized WERE they?! (Answer: VERY.); and my last night on campus, of course (thanks to Chris for nubby Batzmaru, to Ben for eating all my ice cream [no, really! who wants to pack ICE CREAM?!], to the kids that streaked the Quad! [AHHH! Naked people!], to Dan for indulging me in a little ""exhibitionist"" kissing on the Quad, and to Chip for the late night talk).  So it's true.  I WASN'T robbed.  And I know there were more great times, but I'm not going to list them all and bore you all. ;)

And this year.  Full scholarship, new apartment, and as soon as my scars heal a little more, GOOD HAIR!!  But no seizures.  This really will be MY year.  I get another crack at it. ;)  

GAH!  And I'm in a good mood again, and then my mother has to go and be annoying/bitchy.  Cara, we need to start a club."

"event","So today, Kari was my great escape!  She picked me up for: singing and dancing (as best you can in a car...but sometimes that's the best kind) to the Chicago soundtrack (for which we attracted the semi-traumatic attentions of a semi driver...), lunch @ Bagels and More mmmm, quick trip to Turtle Creek, waaaay too much reminiscing about track/cross country, waaaaaay too much laughing at the video of my little brother dancing at a spirit rally last year (which can be brought out again upon request), and waaaaay too much looking at old pictures.  Good times were had by all. :)  And I met the puppy!  And even got some love nips. ;)

And it gets better.  I come home to a letter from the English Department of U of I.  And this means either tears....or tears.  And it was tears. ;)  Another free year!  OK, well in this case, a free semester, since that's all I have left.  :D  God, I was so, SO worried about it this year.  My writing this year was crap.  I never thought I would be so lucky.  So depending on how I feel this year (says my surgeon, ""If you're going back to school this year, bear in mind that exhaustion is usually a complaint of people who have undergone this procedure), I can take one of those extra classes that I was only going to take if it would be free!  I was thinking either another random English class, or French (because I've always wanted to learn, but my dad made me take Spanish in high school), or Latin!!  This makes me way too excited.  But I guess ANYONE would be excited.  Maybe not about Latin, but you know. ;)

And I did a little research on my dream.  The house DOES correspond to the body (I remember that from my Dracula thesis days), but there's more.  I was hiding everything in my bedroom, which is associated with intimacy and relationships.  Interesting, given current events.  And my mom was in the kitchen, which is where one is fed or nurtured (durr), BUT it can also be associated with the literal need to become more aware of dietary habits, which is JUST FUNNY given all of the craziness over this stupid anti-inflammation diet I'm supposedly on; example, I got into a fight with my dad over it, in which he turned waaaay melodramatic: ""Well, I don't want to bury you!""  Seriously, just a little swelling.  Painful, maybe, but NOT what could kill me here.  So that's just a funny random possibility for meaning. ;)  And the terrorists aka thieves:  taking advantage or being taken advantage of; or something that is stealing one's ideas, energy, emotions, or vitality (also interesting, given current events, aka stupid steroid withdrawal).  Also, I hid all of my music, music corresponding to being in or out of harmony or the harmony of one's own emotional outpourings.  Horsefeathers.  But entertained me for about 20 minutes, so whatev.  Special thanks to Kevin J. Todeschi and his Encyclopedia of Symbolism.

But I'm not gonna lie.  Today, and yesterday, and possibly the day before have TOTALLY kicked my ass (much fun was had, but shhheeeebus), so it's time for a nap!!  I am a sleepy, sleepy girl.  Sleepy, but happy. :)  Because seriously, who wouldn't be at this point?"

"event","So the far too vivid nightmare of last night. (Seriously, isn't it about time I stopped having these?  My uncle  says that he had way too realistic nightmares, too, after HIS brain surgery...but this is getting ridiculous.)

Right.  So here goes: terrorists are coming to invade my house and do some good old-fashioned pillaging.  So I do the logical thing and begin hiding everything that means ANYthing to me.  I consider calling friends to send things home with them, but decide that I don't want the terrorists after them, too.  Only my mom seems to be around, and she seems completely OK with the whole situation.  I tell her that I've been hiding things in the hopes of spurring her into some kind of action, but she responds in a ""that's nice, honey"" sort of way and goes back to whatever worthless thing she was doing.

Finally, I decide that it was totally pointless to stash anything, as what self-respecting terrorist isn't going to BURN THE HOUSE DOWN when they're done with it?  So with that, I decide: screw it all; I'm out of here.  So I tell my mom I'm splitting, and I'm out.

I wake up in a cold sweat.

If your house is your body, what does this mean?"

"event","So I took the plunge.

And he took it surprisingly well.  We're even going to be friends.  He took it SO well, in fact, that there was even much joking and fun to be had after.  We had a GREAT time once we weren't dating. :)

He jests: ""So now that we're friends, does this mean that I get to see you more?"" (One of his complaints is that I spent WAAAAY more time with my friends than with him....not a lie.)

And when I joke, ""How am I going to break the news to my grandma?"" (Because she ALWAYS tells me ""He's a keeper."")  He jests: ""Just tell her I'm gay.""  Which of course I can NEVER do, because she's the kind of grandma that would NEVER let me hear the end of it.

And he apologized for taking me for granted, which was just really GOOD to hear.  And not to mention satisfying.  He also apologized for telling me I wasn't brave, so HA! Haha!

It's just weird now.  I mean, you're in a relationship for two years, and then suddenly you're NOT.  As much as I knew this had to happen, and that he was totally holdin' me back, I def had one of those huge stomach-lurching moments about an hour after he left, one of those ""Oh my God, what have I DONE"" moments.  But I think I'm over it.  But it wasn't quite the hugely liberating ""I'm FREEEEEEEEEE!"" break up that I had with the last guy.  But not gonna lie to you, I do enjoy the single life. ;)  So let's bring on the fun.

New subject: I dreamed about Michelle (Ohio Michelle) last night.  I was at her house.  We were on the deck off the kitchen.  We had this gigantic box of something, but I don't remember what it was.  But I DO remember that we weren't supposed to have it.  Always causing trouble. :)  But it was just v. familiar and comfortable to be out on that deck with her, which is weird, because I don't think we actually hung out on the deck a whole lot.  But when I think about it, I can still smell the family room downstairs: those delicious leather couches mmmmm.  It just smelled like a real HOME.  And to this day, I honestly believe that those couches had healing powers.  No joke!  Once when I was sick, I spent the night on one of those couches (against my mother's will, natch), and the next day? TOTALLY FINE!  Haha--I should have gone over there before surgery and seen what kind of trouble I could have saved myself. ;)

New subject: Chris and Ben are visiting today.  And Cara's Jeff...hopefully she'll bring him over for a bit after she picks him up, 'cause I want to meet this character. :)  Good times, noodle salad.  And now I'm off to go call Cone, 'cause Chris and Ben want to meet THIS character. :)"

"event","No really.  On so many levels.

If he calls today, I'm going to do it.  We'll take a little walk, and I'll do it.  No more weakness.  In the immortal words of Elvis: ""A little less conversation, a little more action!""  Or The Doors: ""The time to hesitate is through.""  Or Ani: ""I see you, and I'm so unsatisfied.""

Just, why do I feel like I'm working without a net?  Any volunteers?  In the immortal words of (since that seems to be the running theme here) Bob Dylan: ""She never stumbles, because she's got nowhere to fall.""  It's stupid, though, because you know what scares me?  What if no one better comes along?  What if last year, and not even this last year, but the year before that, was the best I'll have ever had?  STUPID.  And I KNOW IT.  As Mish says: ""You know, he's not IT.""

But seriously, at least for the sake of Cara, I have GOT to quit my bitchin' and just do it.  Little less conversation.

Funny: I can talk about this on my LJ because he doesn't even read it.  

I knew that something was wrong when I actually said these words to Mish at the end of the year: ""I just have too high of expectations.""  Do we all remember the LAST time I made that excuse?  Yeah, we know where this is going.  Because I LIKE my high expectations. 

And I knew something was wrong when someone else would do something really thoughtful for me, and I would be surprised.  As in: ""Oh my God, you're doing something that actually MEANS something to me, and isn't just something totally random and worthless because you haven't taken any time/made any effort to think of something that WOULD mean something."" 

But I guess I've held on so long because I felt like my life was shaken up enough at the moment.

But seriously, who says to a v. recent brain surgery patient, WHILE they're still in the hospital, I have to add: ""I don't think you were brave to have the surgery.  You were brave in the way you handled it, but you weren't brave to have the surgery.""  OK.  Let someone come at YOUR head with a scalpel, and we'll talk brave.  In the immortal words of Cara (thus favorite mua ha): ""WE all thought you were brave.  Kick 'im to the curb!""

And who picks fights with someone who has been diagnosed with anxiety attacks (OK, really seizures caused by the tumor; doctors are dumb sometimes, too) just for the sake of picking fights?!  WHO does that?!  Special thanks to Mish for yelling at the stupid kid for that one.  And yet, when I talk to him, no results.  I get a ""Well, that's how I am with all of my friends, etc, etc.""  Fine.  You treat your friends like that?  Let's be friends.

And my birthday gift.  As Cone says, I've always been ""weird"" about birthdays.  But I blame her!!  Ever since the surprise party she threw for me, every birthday has had some pretty high standards to live up to.  ;)  And I can honestly say that no birthday has ever been as redonk fun. :)  But this birthday.  And this gift from a kid who KNOWS about the birthday weirdness: a Hershey's chocolate bar; a pack of cigarettes (I don't even smoke; plus, he wanted to TAKE THEM BACK); Play-doh (semi-fun); and a cheap imitation of a necklace that my grandmother gave me that I wear out a lot and love (the one from my g-ma, not the poser).  Seriously, I think he just didn't plan and stopped at the gas station across the street on his way to my apartment.  The best part was the card...which ANDREW picked out.  Special thanks to Andrew, my pseudo-boyfriend. :)  Loved the card.

And all of this recovery bullshit gives me way too much time to think/reminisce.  Example: Was listening to CD burned for me last spring by Zack, whom I haven't talked to since last summer.  But didn't realize how bad that kid had it for me.  Every song screams it, though.  Some sample lyrics: ""Jesus, don't cry! You can rely on me, honey."" ""You think it's smart to jump from heart to heart."" And the one that really got me thinking about my current situation: ""I'll never do you no harm....I'll never let you down.""  HA.  Haha!  But it makes me wonder...what if Zack had a) had good teeth, b) suckered me in?  Listening to the CD almost made me miss him.  Almost.  But it certainly made me miss those days.  In the immortal words of Frank (with a riff on the verb tense): ""I had the world on a string."" (Though I'll get back there, rest assured.)  It's almost enough to make me make another attempt at friendship.  Almost.

But the moments of weakness.  They need to go away.  I was def blasting a little Christina Alguilera (""Fighter,"" natch) earlier to get all fired up (don't tell; our secret; but then, I guess there IS no Record Service to be fired from if they find out my guilty pleasures...mmmm like JTimberlake).  I just need to do it.  Cut myself loose.  And as I told my little brother, there will be no tears.

It's funny.  I'm just not that kind of girl anymore.  This year has taken it out of me.  I was trying to remember a time that I cried this year, and there is only one.  I didn't even cry when they told me I had a tumor.  Weirdly enough, though, I almost cried when I told Prof Valente about it...ditto Prof Baron.

In the immortal words of Lauren Malm: ""Boys? Pfft.  I don't cry over BOYS.""  

My God this has been a hella long rant.  I'm just thinking it all through.  Mentally donning my armor.

Random side note: What ROCKS is when there's a mosquito in your ROOM at night when you're trying to sleep and it's buzzing in your EAR. AHHHH!!!  But don't worry, I lured it out of the room (with my own flesh, nontheless), and outsmarted the bastard HA! ;)"

"event","So I've realized that brain surgery is not just head trauma, it's really fully body trauma...because EVERYthing hurts.  Bitchass steroids!  My apologies if you've been the lucky recipient of a ""Don't touch me!"" in the last week or so, because OW, but still, sorry!  But I'm warning everyone now: when I'm feeling better, I'm going to be SUCH a slut for hugs and cuddles and lots and LOTS of SPOONING.  And for the waterski members who partook in this last year, I'm going to be looking for it again this fall: slumber party and sleep in a heap!! :D  It's weird how much you MISS touch when it hurts to be touched...and it's weird, because for a long time, I thought I was someone that was kind of freaked out by being touched a lot...or I guess just by people I didn't know, or something.  I've just always been a girl that liked her space bubble. :)  Something that Mish cured me of--mostly, anyway--freshmen year.  Tough love, that girl has, tough love.   Because by ""cured,"" I mean yelled at.  After Dan made some kind of failed attempt to hug me freshmen year--it freaked me out, what can I say?!  It's scary when you're little.  But.  After I kind of ran for the hills after that, she took me aside and gave me a what for: ""WHAT is your problem?!""  But now I think it's safe to say, CURED.  Cuddle slut, right HERE. :)

So the big excitement of the day so far: I've been reading *Lucy Temple*, sequel to *Charlotte Temple* by Susanna Rowson, American sentimentalist, and Lucy TOTALLY has a Jane Austen moment (something that corresponds to what I'll be working with for my honors thesis this fall): she goes to BRIGHTON!! and there are SOLDIERS there, and this very Lydia-like (remember from *Pride and Prejudice*) character, Lady Mary Lumley (one of Lucy's fellow orphans; naturally, they're orphans, because this is a sentimentalist novel) is def showing potential of going down the Lydia path bwa ha!  I'm WAY too excited about this.  English major to the core.

But I've got big plans for the rest of the day, including but not limited to: trip to Turtle Creek (woo! lovelove my bookstore); trip to post office and library (though I refuse to go in, because it's Talcott, and GHETTO!...though I only say this because as a former employee of Roscoe, I'm biased...); and Girls' Night with the mother (Dad and Lil Bro are out of town!), complete with chick flicks and girly food.  

So reading Cone's/Cara's/Ben's entries: I wishwishwish I had just sucked it up yesterday and popped some more painkillers, because awww B&N and Taco Bell giddiness. GRR.  Though I can't feel too bad about nearly 8 hours of action!  But soon!!  And then watch out, 'cause then I'll have had nearly a month of rest under my belt, and YOU won't be able to keep up with ME!! :D  But Conielove, we have to get together before that, 'cause I got your message, and you're back from Columbus, so WOO!

But I am a HOOOONGRY girl, so gah, off to see what kind of graduation party leftovers we have.  Why, WHY do I feel like I'm going to be eating barbeque for months?!  

And mother wants computer.  And my fingers are numb, so I am DONE. ;)"

So it's semi-funny. Esp. the Anger. :)  Though not really accurate...Do you think I'm angry? Hahahahaha...this reminds me of a time, going out and playing at Old Settlers' Days (aka White Trash Days) with Cara, wearing ""my"" (OK, stolen from my Dad's closet, and who knows HOW old) ""Have A Shitty Day"" T-shirt.  Because it's SO not me, but that's what makes it great.

Speaking of Cara, she's currently my favorite. :)  She totally sprung me today, AND brought me to Imperial Palace for Chinese!!!!  Which I have been craving for DAAAAAYS, and my mother (aka Elvira, the mean nurse) won't let me eat because I'm still in recovery.  But Chinese would have = happiness, and that's important too!!  But Cara knows. :)  Thus favorite.  And later?  GILMORE GIRLS!!!!!  And such good talks. :)  Another ""Cara Knows"" moment: ""Is she cuter than me?""  The answer?  NO!  Thus favorite.  And listening/singing along to U2's ""Elevation"" in the car (always a good activity!).  Thus favorite.  Lurve it!

And the steroid withdrawal update: have evolved from just swelling to combo swelling (though less so) and bruising.  I'm CUTE.  Lurvely.  But.  Was blasting ""Elevation"" this morning, because we know that this is a song that must be played at high volume, so I think I've turned a corner. :)  And I survived the lil bro's grad party yesterday...no small feat!  It turned out to be 7 and a half hours of party action!!!  But cameo from Cara (and escape to porch with cake and punch) helped.  Thus favorite. ;)  (She told me to add that mua ha silly girl.)  AND saw hooligan neighbor Clint (who made me cry at every single one of my birthday parties when I was a kid, yet I always invited him again), so that was good times. ;)  He keeps trying to drag me out to the tractor/trailer races at the Speedway, but I'm not having it.  I just think he likes the challenge.  AND cousin John (who now owns a bar!) came by, so that was good times.  He's always entertaining.

And Tuesday/Wednesday? Girls' Nights with mom, since lil bro and Dad will be at U of I for Orientation.  Let's see if I can convince the woman to get a pedicure with me.  As I have said to Cara: this summer is the education of my mother.  I'm teaching her how to be a girl, 'cause she just doesn't get it.  I think I just like the challenge. ;)

Thursday? Possible visit from Chris.

Friday? Who knows!  But I think it's going to be a good week. :)  This makes me v. happy.

Now if only Ben would get here so we could get GG going!! :D"

Sorry if I've been MIA for a chunk of days now, but let m tell you about a litle life experience called steroid ithdrawal.  'Cause it's a good one.  Anyone who does this to him/herself voluntarily deserves anything they get, bcause YIKES.  OUt of the entire brain surgey recovery thing, THIS has been the worst:

BLINDING headaches.  Even worse than RIGHT after surgery (But that could be the morphine talking...).  I feel for you Cone--I don't envy you those migraines, but I'll take your solidarity. ;)
Numb fingers.  Thus lots of typos.
Numb face.  Oh, AND I'm all swollen again.
Numb LIPS.  It's crazy.  Try talking.  Try EATING.
The SHAKES!  My friend Dennis says I sound like I'm coming off heroin or something.
Dizziness/a little blurred vision.
A touch of slurred speech...also thrilling.

Since Sunday.  I'm ready for this to go away.  TOMORROW.  Needs to stop.  Because I can't DO anything.  AI""m so BORED.  It hurts my head to read, to look at this computer screen (I are smart, but so bored).  I've been taking a lot of ""accidental naps.""  There's nothing else to do.  I'm going stir crazy!  I just want to be BETTTER already!!

The best part?  Since it was brain surgery, all of the above symptoms have the added element of: it's probably steroid withdrawal, but if it gets really bad, come in and see us so that we can make sure we didn't mess up the left side of your body while we were playing with the right side of your brain.  So that's awesome.
Not gonna lie...scares me a little sometimes...

Second: annoying late side effect: air bubbles in my left ear.  I feel like I've been breathing underwater for the last two days now.  Not huge in the large scheme of things, but you can understand, annoying!!

Third: and this is REALLY random.  Anyone interested in trying to throw together some kind of small garage sale tingy with me in a bit this summer?  (I'm thinking maybe Cara, 'cause I know she was complaining about unpacking, like me.)  Cause yeah, the prob is, have been trying to unpack, but have all this random dorm/apartment stuff that I don't need anymore (and even some clothing!!), that I have nothing to do with, but dn't really want to throw out.  But maybe a small group of us could pool this stuff that we don't need anymore, and throw together a ""Going Away to College Sale"" for future freshmen who will actually be needing this stuff.  Cause I've got dorm stuff, like bedding/lights/small furniture, etc.  And if my lil bro doesn't take the mini fridge, I've even got a fricken fridge!!

"event","So it's my last night on campus for the summer.  Took my traditional (though slightly abbreviated) goodbye-for-the-summer walk of campus.  Saw my sculpture (with Dan, natch), my pineapple fountain, the alma mater, etc.  And saw lots of random people on the street, including but not limited to David, Amy, Joe & Karrie.  Or however the hell you spell her name.  Even Wes/Cliff!  And he still needs to cut his hair.  But again, I forgot to see my buffalo. :(  I think that was maybe just a freshman year thing.  Oh, and Joe, this one's for you: I'm pissed!  Way to return my phone calls.  Good luck in New York, jerk.  

But I have a giant Batzmaru, so all is okay. :)  It has nubbins.

And this is my first year not being ALONE at the end of the last night on campus.  It's v. strange, to come home to sound and movement and smells.  TVs on, roommates talking.  Leftover pizza smells.  As much as I didn't like to be the last one finished with finals, and to be the one ""left behind,"" I DID appreciate the night to myself, to think about the year, to write about it.  My freshmen year, I was alone both the first night (after getting in from goin' out gallavanting, of course) AND the last night, and on the last night, there was a huge rainstorm.  It was almost too perfect for words.  Taking my walk, coming home to the silence, and then the sound of the downpour, the beating rain against the windows and the thunder.  And sitting alone in my room, writing about it all.

All in all, it's been an interesting year.  I think it's been worth it.  Though (not gonna lie) I'm def looking forward to NEXT year.  Looking forward to when this year isn't quite so fresh in my memory.  Though there have been numerous good times, including, but not limited to, and in no particular order:

Any kind of dancing @ Bro's, esp. with their overly familiar music...
""This is why I love hanging out with boys."" (You know who you are.)
U of I Halloween: ""If you can't be famous, pretend to be!"" (You ALSO know who you are!)
Record Service coupon-ing (illegally) on Quad Day with Joe (that jerk!) & Holly.
My BIGASS Mardi Gras beads.
""Almost Famous""/Orange Crush (plus trip to Walmart!) party with Andrew.
MY 21st BIRTHDAY. (which, of course, would be #1 if this list were in order....haha!)
Pink feather boa, compliments of Benny.
Kubby's ""dancing lessons.""
The introduction of ""Sex and the City"" into my TV knowledge.
My ethnographical house!!  YOU'RE NOT BORING!!!

OMG.  There are so many more.  But I'm sleepy.

So I'm going to go write."

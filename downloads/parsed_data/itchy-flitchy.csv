Ok to start this,It might of seem that I am a cold hearted bitch at times,I really am not.
I care alot of how people feel and i try to help them and give them advice as best as I can,
I really am a good listener,sometimes late at night my brain jsut turns itself off and I see someone peak but I really can't bring myself to listen,but that's only when I concentrate on two thngs at the same time,or when i am extremly tired.
I really care alot,so don't get me wrong.On the other hand I really can't stand people who talk about their issues...like constantly,people who care only for them and their problems,I hate it when they only speak just to hear themselves talk.

anyway.

My wisdom teeth are out:DI'm excited,caue I'm the only one in my family who doesn't have to take them out.
It's saterday,I have to call the greek councel this monday to ask if my passport is ready yet.Argh,I'm also going to the canadian councel next week,i'm wicked excited for that.

"event","<sup>Ok,I just spent an hour reading through my old entrys not even being close to the end.
and i have chaned so much and my thoughts have become so different.and i speak better english:)
All i know is that i've been really retarted in the last few years,I've been complaining alot so i hope my 19th year will be a good year for me a great change,i really need this year of from everyone.
start to think about my life what to do where to go who to meet and most important to see where this will lead me.
I need to take a break from this.everything that is happening in my life right now,nothing is really happening&that's what i want to quit really,i want to expierinece things with old&new friends i want to travel,see abit of canada.I'm really excited for this year.
it's 3.18am right now,i'm tireed but i know if i go to bed now,all i'll do is think about my life
and right now i can't handle thinking about it,cause i'll start crying and i havn't cried in a month,I'm close to tears,but defo didn't cry,or was it less then a month?i don't remember....what i do remember is that i havn't cried in a long time,it feels good to be strong...on the outside.

I've been so addicted to myspace,but all this weidos keep adding me and i always click on deny,cuz i really don't want to add anyone who I don't know either in real life,or I have known before the myspace-hype,allas i do add people who add me through friends cuz my friends are good people and they have good friends.
I think I'm going to delete some people...i hate when they don't talk.

Anyway I mustbe off...not really,ut the tipping on the keyboard is really loud and everyones asleep.</sup>

Dave:Thats ok=)....*someone yells out for dave he looks at us and say*Ah damn it,I gotte do some work,sorry.But we'll see us at the show(thats so great he said that about 4 times)
So em and tina walk off,I give them a last look and I see steve smiling at me.Derykc and Steve really wernt all too motivated.
So we went out and waited for sum41 to coem out and give autographs n shizznet.So we're waiting and waiting they finally come out.
I'm getting my very first pic with deryck,who wasnt all to hppy bout it.
I sticked out my tongue AT DERYCK he was such a cunt.Seriously!

Dave:Oh whats that?
Joey:Thats ouzo,its greek
Dave:Oh I know that stuff
Tina:it's very strong
Dave:haha yeah i know.Thanks Joey
Joey*smiles*
I after that saw dave taken a picture with the ouzo bottle holding it up.
Then i went over to CONE.....took a pic and gave him a bottle of white wine(since I nkow tis his favourite

Cone:Aww whats that?
Joey:It's white wine
Cone:Aww thank you,come here*gives Joey a big hug*
He was really cool and he wasnt shy at all.Hes my second fave member now...lmao.
Well then they left and we left to go to the show,it was 6pm and we were runnign around like idiots to find the damn club.So when we finally got there,there were about 10 people,it was really cold.
The doors opend at 7.30pm and I went over to the guestlist girl who then gave us our cards.
We went inside and i was standing right infront of DAVE like last year.It was fuckign amazing,after 1 hour the guys came on stage and rocked the house,it was fucking incredible.They palyed a hell lot of new songs not only ""We're all to blame""and ""welcome to hell""
Everyone jumed as they played fat lip.I screamed my lounges otu as Grab the dvil by the horns came and derykc said""Everyone give ti up for DAVE""
Dave looked at us a few times and smiled.
Deryck:This is to the old school sum41 fans*Makes no difference* 
Well all in all the show was amazng.
They finished the show with P4P...and I filmed the part stev humped coen and dave gave him an asslap with hsi guitar.Fucking awesome.
Well they went off stage and we waited for them to coem,otu i started to cry ebcause we've been waiting 15 minutes and i lost my hopes that Dave woudl coem out,I had to give him Nic's letter.
So we went out and there was the tourbus and guess who was there?
DAVE!!
We went over to him and he ased me if im fine and if I had fun at the show which i awnserd with a big loud""YES""..then I said Oh i ahve a letter for you

Dave:OMG that fuckign rocks,thanks Joey!
*I have a big fat green in my face*
Dave:Well have a nice trip bakc home,Joey
Joey:Thank you so much for everything
*joey smiles*
Then we had another pictures with the other guys taked and i got ym hat signed,derykc laughed at me because I coudlnt work out the way Esras camera worked.
then this girl was there and I said hti him with that psoter on the head,please,so she did and deryck didnt midn he was laughing actually,she did it 3-4 tiems then his bodyguard came.

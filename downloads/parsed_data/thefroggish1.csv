Me and jun are together... been what hmmm... 2yrs and 6months... wow never thought it could happen... i love him so much i could cry and i have... and he has lol fun stuff huh... hes graduating this yr too.. im proud ^_^ hes going to start at Merrimack this fall.. i think its merrimack well anyways yeah... hes got a full ride to that college so to speak. all he has to pay for is his books and food i think. not so sure on the details. all i know is that ill miss him. unless i get a car and my license anytime soon then ill be able to see him :( but its been 2yrs and no ones taught me to parallel park so im screwed ha

I have graduated from NECC w.an associates in graphic design... well technically i graduated a yr ago but i was lazy and never submitted the paperwork so now im class of '09 hah i am not guna take part in the graduation ceremony i know NO1 graduating and i havent been to school in a yr so i dun feel that i deserve to. so i bought myself a mini '09 tassel ^_^ and ill be receiving my certificate soon enough in the mail. so now i need to find another school to go on and further my accomplishments. i need at least a bachelors to get a job :( so yeah ima be like an old ass freshman... at least i still look like a teen haha

im a shift manager at McDougles which means i wake up b4 the sun and am a slave to the Jew lol i am paid to smile and take ppls shit w.o dishing it back but im glad i have this shitty job cuz theyre are so many ppl who dun have a job or got laid off or just wont get hired by any1... plus i learned to be patient and be a two face ha just kiddin... i just learned to smile in an assholes face like he aint done shit to piss me off... haha and ive learned to make a voice in DT... its so diff from my real voice... i have a deep female voice that could be confused for a prepubescent boys voice but in DT i have a high white girl voice its rly quite amazing... but im tired all the time and i literally wear eye makeup to cover how fkn tired i am i hate my job but at least ive got 1... oh ha the only highlight of my job is making this guy named Medwin's life miserable muahahahahahahahahahahahaaha i pick on him SO much but its only cuz i like him. he makes me smile even when hes being an ass its rly quite sad :( i dun think ima see him much i mean its like i duno... the friendship that i saw there has dissapeared over this past week but who knows... hmph well

ima go watch some online TV shows that ive missed... till its beddy bye time seeing as i cant fkn go out cuz ive gotta open tomorrow... yay *rolls eyes*"

how do you really know if someone likes you back?
well... other than directly asking them how do you get to it....
im so sick of feeling bad... i hate that i want to cry everytime he calls
i can be on the phone with him for hours (and i mean hours) and ill be so happy to just hear his voice and laugh at him and his friend acting like a bunch of drunken idiots... damn alcoholics *weak giggle*...
God... why do i like him so much... i swear i am so weak when it comes to him
i dont know why!? its not like hes friggin' Brad Pitt or anything but for some reason i care so much about him... and when he drinks i wish he would stop... and when he smokes i just want to freaking shove the damn ciggarette into his eye! God i dont know why i care so much
it scares me *starts to cry* why cant he just be another guy to me? why do i have to be so attached... i mean i care about all my friends but this is like my first guy friend and i just wish i could think of him as just one of the girls... God im so angry at myself T_T i dont want to hug him or love him anymore... its not my place to do so... i just wish he would be straight up... this way i can get over it and move on...
i hate emotions... well enough  of my crap of the heart

then to Borders...got some more mangas....
Go SGT FROG! woop woop!
omi got vampire taro cards
well we went to Wal Mart too so that Yon could get a journal
then we went to claires and wasted some time till my sis and her
friends were done at borders
that didnt last long so we went walking around the loop
like around the back to kill time
i see Jeff and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is ""fuck""
wow i've gotten bad at censoring myself...
he saw me and my highlighter green sweater lol
that killed any chance i ever thought i had
Yon can go for it now heh heh

time ago if he had no intention of furthering the
relationship...some know what i mean.... i mean its
a long distance relationship and all but you do not 
end it just like that! i had so much respect for the
man until now... i cant believe he would do such a thing

Speak
By Laurie Halse Anderson

*singing Breaking Benjamin* ""...there's no way, theres no way, that im running away..."" God i love this cd...
...well any-who... day three and i now know how to play a crappy BrainStew by Green Day and a song that i can only remember the chord to...the name i dunno...its a common song though...good rock song...if i could only remember more than ""open, 3, 5, open, 3, 7,5""...
...Greg didnt look as sexy as before...i dunno why... poor thing i was really bitchy lately and i might have made him feel bad -.- i didnt mean to! its just that i want to ignore him so that i dun start likeing him...he has a girlfriend... i dun wanna be a whore... -.- damn me for being considerate of others.... im all depressed lately...dont know why though...could be partly because my B-day is coming up and everyone is keeping twhats being planned a secret... damn people...if its not the secret its the fact that everyone else never remembers when it is... *shrugs* i guess thats best... oh and another reason is that all the guys i've had crushes on for the past couple of years and lately all like Mouse! FOOK! seriously im doomed to be alone forever because im an ugly fat ass thats not good enough to be crushed on...maybe crushed with a boulder but not to be liked...awww forget it...i give up... it always happens... i shouldnt even bother....
...everyone could see that i wasnt ok...Amy kept on asking me if i was ok and then Mouse and Omi and Odie and ya know what stuff likr that just messes up a person even more... i need to stay away and not touch anyone... this way i wont get bitched at or looked at with snake eyes... screw this peice of shite life.... i need a giutar to break.... -.- Fook"

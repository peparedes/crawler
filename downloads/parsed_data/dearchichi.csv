<strong>Character of a Happy Life</strong>
by Sir Henry Wotton

How happy is he born and taught
That serveth not another's will;
Whose armour is his honest thought,
And simple truth his utmost skill!

Whose passions not his masters are;
Whose soul is still prepared for death,
Untied unto the world by care
Of public fame or private breath;

Who envies none that chance doth raise,
Nor vice; who never understood
How deepest wounds are giv'n by praise;
Nor rules of state, but rules of good;

Who hath his life from rumours freed;
Whose conscience is his strong retreat;
Whose state can neither flatterers feed,
Nor ruin make oppressors great.

Who God doth late and early pray
More of His grace than gifts to lend;
And entertains the harmless day
With a religious book or friend.

This man is freed from servile bands
Of hope to rise, or fear to fall;
Lord of himself, though not of lands;
And having nothing, yet hath all.

I really enjoyed my stay at Cuddalore, and I must say that I fancy bus journeys now after going via. KPN a few times. I just love the surypy tea served at the shops the buses halt at during the journeys. And, I spent 6 hours in a crowded unreserved compartment on the way back from Tirupur today. I now need some rest!

I'm now reading a fascinating book called <strong>Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention</strong> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. It's been a real eye-opener, and I don't remember the last book for which I made as many notes as I have while reading this one.

My next stop: Mumbai, probably.

The more the number of weddings I shoot, the more I admire <a href=""http://www.jeffascough.com/"">Jeff</a>'s work.

For more than two years, <a href=""http://www.animalpak.com/"">this</a> has been one of the best examples of the principles of marketing I have seen. They know their target audience to a fault, and use all that knowledge to pitch their stuff aggressively and in style. The photographs, the text and the layout are all designed to get fans to linger around leading to great brand acceptance levels. The product and price acceptances naturally follow."

And what a city&nbsp; it is - so vibrant, colorful, varied and welcoming. And, I read up a co-passenger's ""The Last Lecture"" by Randy Pausch on the Jodhpur Express to Mumbai and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki on the way back on the Chalukya Express. While the former was instructive in the first few chapters, I was totally absorbed by Kiyosaki's book.

And, after being introduced to Mr. T.S. Satyan through Anush's <a href=""http://anushsh.livejournal.com/132906.html"">post</a>, I'll go check out his exhibit in person, though I saw some of his photographs on <a href=""http://www.tasveerarts.com/artists/satyan_gallery01.shtml"">Tasveer's online gallery</a>.

Archana and I moved into a rented flat in Malleswaram.

I got accepted into the <a href=""http://www.agwpja.com/"">Artistic Guild of the WPJA</a>, and at the moment, it looks like I'm the only one in the country to receive such an invite.

Through the <a href=""http://innovationnet.ning.com/"">India Innovation Network</a>, I have met up with amazing beings like Rajeev Kumar. He's just 36, but the amount of lives he's packed into that span is astonishing.

I enjoyed distributing books published by Ramakrishna Ashram to a school on Kanakpura Road.

I have been wow'ed by <a href=""http://www.rolfpotts.com/"">Rolf Potts</a> and his book, <a href=""http://www.vagablogging.net/"">Vagabonding</a>.

Not many books have been read this time. I've have been going through a few of the ones I have already read.

<strong>E-Myth Mastery: The Seven Essential Disciplines for Building a World Class Company</strong> by  Michael E. Gerber
<strong>Write to Sell: The Ultimate Guide to Great Copywriting</strong> by Andy Maslen

<strong>Built From Scratch: How A Couple Of Regular Guys Grew The Home Depot From Nothing To $30 Billion</strong> by Bernie Marcus, Arthur Blank and Bob Andelman
<strong>The Ten Commandments for Business Failure</strong> by Donald R. Keough

The last one was a real let down, considering the names behind the jacket blurbs. A lot of the same old stuff that you find in every other decent book on business.

"event","<div align=""justify"">I took a handsome, young photographer out to dinner last week. <a href=""http://thecontrarian.in/about/"">Mahesh Shantaram</a> quit his high-profile job in the IT industry in the U.S. to pursue his interest in photography fulltime. Conversations about his extensive travel experiences, his prior work on capturing lives in the metros around the world and his ""zero-balance"" lifestyle filled up the three hours that we were together. And, apart from picking up some clever ideas about his business - which he willingly shared with me -, I was introduced to the photography of Nick Brant and Martin Parr.

<a href=""http://www.nickbrandt.com/"">Nick Brant</a>'s work is exactly what I have been looking for all over the web for innovation in wildlife photography. Man, does he deliver! His black and white images of the big mammals in Africa are breathtaking with their lighting, composition and drama. Surely, his work points to a new frontier in capturing the natural wonders of the world on camera. After getting tired of seeing all labeled mugshots of creatures around - some of them no doubt wonderful-, I'm inspired by Nick's vision.

<div align=""center"">***
</div>
I browsed through <a href=""http://www.sandeshkadur.com/"">Sandesh Kadur</a>'s work on the Sahyadris at a bookstore. I have heard of him in general photographic circles. He must have spent quite some time among in the ghats to capture many of the photographs in the book. While the print quality and layout of the coffee-table reference work is excellent, the textual matter that is supposed to augment and explain the photographs totally lack in breath and detail. And, the book costs a bomb. Many say their work is targeted at conservationists and at people who are willing to protect what we have left of the wild but who need some help to get started. I wonder how many such stripling guardians-of-nature would buy works like these.

"event","<div align=""left""><div align=""left"">Well, after about 6 months of a self-imposed hiatus, I'm back to my home on the Internet. And, apart from expressing myself in here about things I value, I sorely missed interacting with my LJ friends. And, just look at the stuff they have been up to, packing in vacations overseas, bird-watching trips, published articles, eco-tourism guidance to the uninitiated, purchases of status toys, visits to shacks that serve up delicious food and exchanging vows with their spouses all over again after decades of living with one another! It was a wonderful experience catching up with all the writing that they have put up while I was away.<br /><br />The past months were used up to explore things that I haven't previously ventured into, like ingratiating myself with folks I would be seeing quite a bit, initiating myself with Kannada movies after years, learning about the components and textures of sarees, appreciating fine jewelery and their delicate construction, tuning my tone deaf ear to the phenomena of pitch variations in songs and having a close look at the lives of people who belong to the generations before mine. I have been exposed to some genuinely wealthy people and have sampled the lifestyles they lead, to those who are authentically generous at heart who don't twitch before splurging thousands on friends, to those who maintain a heartwarming camaraderie among their extended family members resulting in truly memorable bonding sessions. I have been witness to several demonstrations on the skill of nurturing a tremendous network of contacts, and how honest concern and genuine interest about the other person, put across through sweetly constructed sentences in an appropriately modulated tone, could win over people, whether they are film industry biggies, influential businessmen, retired super cops or the guy or girl next door. I have been awed by the affection showered upon the donors of monetary benefits by beneficiaries during their times of want even years after the events, by those who impress with their knowledge about maintaining huge agricultural estates while walking around in them and by the gay attitudes of those who have had to shoulder a cascade of soul-crushing troubles during their lives. I have valued my interaction with those who detail various facets of the plenty of food we have sampled, to those young kids who can strip you naked by accurately verbalizing your most private thoughts only by sitting in front of you and the hundreds of miles all of us have clocked together in my beloved car.<br /><br />My partner and I have experienced a ""rainbow of emotions"" the past few months, from helplessness due the general stressors of wedding events and the work leading up to it, to the joy of discovering a soul with whom each could express and realize oneself. And, together with my Mother-about whom I have discovered quite a bit more through the eyes of my wife-, we hope to lead lives less ordinary.<br /></div><br /></div>"

<div align=""justify"">Archana and I attended my college buddy's wedding reception yesterday in Girinagar last evening. Shankar has been a close friend since our first meet a decade ago during our first year in engineering. His quick wit, sharp mind and refreshing presence of mind made him a delightful person to hang out with, and all our tricks played out in the electronics laboratory for three years would be etched in my memory due to his commentary on them. His folks have always received me warmly during my visits to his house were we used to brainstorm several times before exams. Manasa sure would be glad to have made such a fine conquest. God bless the couple.

</b><div align=""justify"">Archi! Interacting with her is like facing a firing squad. You are first stunned by the ethereal glow that rests softly on her person as she walks across sections of dappled sunlight beneath the trees around college, with the pretty patterns formed by columns of luminous sunshine gliding over her face and her luxuriant hair . The next blow is delivered when she breaks into her radiant smile in the midst of her rolling out those polished sentences, with the two senses of ours that catch such moments flushing us wonder. And, the knockout punch is delivered when she considers what you have to say with a gleam in those kindly eyes, when she offers her thoughts on the subject with all the surrounding logic that makes it valuable and when she laughs with you at your attempts at humor. And after the show's over, we can only limp back dazed into our insipid world consisting of the same old tired cares, wistfully longing to have a part of her for ourselves so as to inject some of that divine spark into our days.

"event","<div align=""justify"">There are few pursuits in the world that give me as much pleasure as bodybuilding. It's one of those sports where you compete with yourself every time you do it, daring those weights you have set about to conquer, ripping apart every fibre of the muscle group you focus on by bombing it lifeless with sets whose final few repetitions are pure agony, when you simply have to push past the intense burn caused by the lactic acid that pools around the working fibres. That's when the growth is triggered, and thats when you feel like you have made it all worthwhile. And, ofcouse, grunting it out in the inspired presence of my all time favorite bodybuilder, the strong and silent one with a Ph.D. in pain, 6x Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates, would make it fun. And <a href=""http://dearchichi.livejournal.com/49928.html"">this</a>, ofcourse, is my favorite post on bodybuilding. :-)

The gym at Bowring Institute has reopened and I sure am gonna give those weights some serious knocking. They had better be ready!

"event","<div align=""justify"">Major Mukund has come down to Bangalore for a short visit, and I had been to his house today to catch up with him, his wife Malini, also an old friend of mine, their son Madhav and Mukund's mother. ""Maddy"" has grown up quite a bit since I last saw him and is, at two and a half years, not as shy of strangers as he was earlier. And not only can he understand basic Kannada, but can also speak a bit of it while demonstrating his mastery of the flying-kiss, the salute and the bye-bye hand wave. He must be quite a devil at home if one goes by the missing head and danger lights of his toy cars and his penchant for discovering how things work! Here are a few photographs I managed to make in the poor street lights I got to work with.

<strong>...but, peace rules in the end! :-)</strong>
</div>
</div>While Mukund appeared pretty sober compared to his usual gregarious self due to him feeling the burden of several issues that needs his attention, I was very saddened to see the pallid person of his mother -with whom I get along famously-, her face drained of its trademark exuberance that used to add much effect to her words as she played her traditional role as the livewire of their household. And, the few extra pounds that she's added to her frame didn't help her appearance at all. But, I am certain that the fresh surroundings of the flat at Ulsoor into which they would move into this weekend would cause her to sizzle once again! :-)

I'm delighted at the prospects, and I sure-as-hell am ready!

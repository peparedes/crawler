"event","i sit here and repeatedly ask myself, ""isn't there anything better i could be doing at a quarter to 4 am?"".. the answer is always yes. and the better is to be sleeping. but i've obviously had many issues in that area lately. like my dad would say, i'm going to get myself sick. be so run down i can barely move. and maybe i need that, to lay in bed for&nbsp;a few days.. but if i can't lay in bed to go to sleep, i need to find a supplement for what i'm lacking. many-a-day has been spent on a caffeine high, yet i highly doubt that's why i'm up at 4 am. in fact, i believe i'm developing a slight insomnia.

i'm very afraid to go to sleep. i have a fear of missing something, a fear of missing someone. i want to witness everything there is to witness before fading, before i have to say goodbye. hopefully goodbye is far away, but you can't help to think that if you go to sleep tonight, will you wake up tomorrow?

so i constantly sit here and ask myself questions, and the question tonight is one i can't stand. one i wish i didn't have to. one re-evaluting whom i trust. there are few and far between who have proven themselves deserving, and very much knowing who they are.&nbsp; a few months back, miss viv told me i give my trust too easily, and that i have friends who backstab me. and that someone i thought i am quite close to, happens to be someone i should stay away from. i have not told him that was said, quite frankly because i don't believe it. it so turns out to be someone who has been there through everything that is the one i need to stray from.

tonight was a night for a drive.&nbsp;a long one at that. with one of those talks you long for, and at the end, wish you never had. you learn so much about those you ""love"" and those who ""love"" you. but i don't really believe in the word love. it's 4 letters tossed around like a hot potato, in some cases, not all.

i smash heads with a friend, over multiple subjects, actually most. she is incredibly judgemental and extremely blunt. the ability to be blunt is not necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes it's good to keep your mouth shut. sometimes the truth isn't always the right thing too say. sometimes you need to sugarcoat things.

i know we all have them. people in our lives that really know how to make you feel like shit. the people who know where to hit and how hard, just so they can ruin your day. and there's those who talk about you behind your back, knowing you're going to find out and really don't care. i hate people like that. my theory is if you have something to say, say it to my face. if you cannot say it to me, why bother saying it at all.

apparently i there are things i've done that i wasn't aware of. and apparently, i'm a bad kid. yet, i haven't had an extraordinary past 4 years to insult my mother's disciplinary skills and say you need to step in as a second mother. especially when you're younger and way more naive to things. i think that thus far i have done very well for myself. granted&nbsp;i have done stupid things, but we all have. we all have that stint where we have the desire to try things and the desire to go places and the urge to lie to our parents. not one teen is ever completely honest with their parents, and those who are usually aren't rewarded for it.. yet neither are those who tell a tiny white lie to go see a band, or to go visit a friend. i don't think parents ever really believe their children anyway.

so why do those who are ""friends"" have to make you feel like absolute shit. make you feel worthless? like you're less than everybody else? around her i feel like i shouldn't be living, that i've done something wrong. but i know that i haven't. i did not drag my friends two hours to lose my virginity. i did not get wasted and then make confessions to my mother. i did not judge my friend's friends outside of our small circle based the outside view in.

so what i party? so what&nbsp;i tried alcohol and liked it? so what&nbsp;i tried cigarettes? so what&nbsp;i tried pot? so what i snuck to philly for a weekend? so what i've ridden the NY subway system after midnight? i'd rather experience things than sit back and watch the world go by. my biggest fear is growing old and looking back, only to be disappointed in myself. to regret *not* trying, not experimenting. not being a kid.

so go ahead, judge me. my mother trusts me. i can be slightly more honest than i used to be. granted she isn't always gung ho, but she realizes she was the same way and cannot exactly be hypocritical about it.

you don't feel what i'm feeling. you aren't me. you don't control me. you aren't my friend. you are jealous. you are blunt. you are not a friend. you are a bitch. you say you care, but i cannot believe you. you insult my mother. you wished for something that if it actually happened, you'd be lost. you don't know what you're talking about. you believe everyone should be like you.

news flash: i am me. i live to please myself. if i cannot do that, than i cannot be truly happy. my ultimate goal is to wear a smile i am not faking. it is to brighten another person's day. it is to live with no regrets. it is to live as if tomorrow wasn't going to come.

so fuck you and you're beliefs. fuck what you think. take it or leave it.

peace&amp;love"

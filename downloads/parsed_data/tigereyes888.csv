My Dad found me on the computer at like 1am (go figure I forget he is still asleep downstairs) and he told me to get my butt upstairs and leave the computer on. My dad did what he has always threatened to do. Change the password  on the computer. My life is ridiculous. RIDICULOUS. Yes, ridiculous. I'm going crazy. Why can't I be one of the graduating senoirs who are going off to college and leaving their family at home? Its not fair. Can't wait for college. No parents. 

And my older sister keeps acting like my mom. I'm good with only one mom, thanks...

Harry Potter was fun. Half of it I spent talking to sarah about what was wrong with the movie :P good times...

I can get by with nothing
Of all the blessings life can bring,

You're my only reason,
You're my only truth

Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you

To courage again
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds rage
And it's so amazing

My brothr just said he isn't going to be home on his birthday :o!!! He'll probably be too busy getting drunk anyway to remember us :(. My sister is gone for her Spring Break, though she is home all the time. Down in Maryland doing who knows what :(. Then my brother is leaving today leaving ME with Jenn and Jeff (kill me now).

""It's me, not you.""- thats me talking to school. (NOT JOKING!) The thing is being a zombie and being wicked tired for like two weeks- midterms last week- is taking its toll on me and it needs to stop. I'm getting real sleep tongiht and no one is going to stop me. 

State coaches meet this weekend and I'm running the 2 mile. Nervous already. Another factor of my tiredishishness! It needs to stop, it really does. But my friends are awesome. That much can be said. lol- <i>Sarah's Critique</i>

<center><p> I went to the doctors today- it wasnt so bad except i was nervous because i was supposed to get a shot tetanus i think its called but i had already had it. I KNEW it was supposed to be too good to be true. I had blood taken- it was only one vial though- But not many people know i have a serious problem with the whole ""needle-in-your-skin"" thing. But it wasnt as bad as i had thought it would be and I am still alive now so you can ""see"" that I am alright.

"event","I've never cried so much in my life. I feel as though- well- i dont have any friends. I need to dig myself out of this depression. All of this over a stupid movie. My life is so messed up. Stupid assumption. It wasnt all over a stupid movie. There are so many fucking things going on in my life. Sometimes I just want to curl up and like my dog and not do anything. Just sit there. Or maybe turn into an inanimate object. Screw life in general. Screw it.

"event","now i will tell you what i've done for you
50 thousand tears i've cried
screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
and you still won't hear me
don't want your hand this time i'll save myself
maybe i'll wake up for once
not tormented daily defeated by you
just when i thought i'd reached the bottom
i'm dying again

i'm going under
drowning in you
i'm falling forever
i've got to break through
i'm going under

blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
so i don't know what's real and what's not
always confusing the thoughts in my head
so i can't trust myself anymore
i'm dying again

i'm going under
drowning in you
i'm falling forever
i've got to break through

so go on and scream
scream at me i'm so far away
i won't be broken again
i've got to breathe i can't keep going under

Oh I'm sorry did i say excited, i meant Xcited. My sister will probably be coming home for the end of the summer but there are things in that situation that i probably shouldnt write down here, in some online journal. But that also means my brother will be leaving for UCONN. Not very happy times, i can tell you. I think my biggest problem is I hate change. I once changed the bedspread in my room and it felt weird...I don't know, i am just weird in the change area...
Cannot wait until potc comes out only <img src='http://www.animationlibrary.com/Animation11/Alphabets/Changing_colors/3.gif'> more days!!!"

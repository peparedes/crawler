He could change to human form. In my dream the demon's human form was Brian Kinney for qu*eer as folk. So the demon falls in love with the girl for her special ability to read and speak his language. He comes to her one night and presents himself in his handsome human form as a demon. She is afraid of him and runs. He buys a house next door to her. I clearly see the demon buying the house. He argues with the realtor who realizes the demon has a lot of money...the realtor keeps trying to sell him a nicer house but the demon insists on this ghetto house. Anyway demon moves next door and transforms himself into a different still handsome human form. He seduces the girl. She falls in love with him. He revels as this new human guy that he also knows the ancient language her grandfather taught her. This makes her love him even more and she feels their love is rare and stronger because of this unique talent. One night she is reading the ancient language and says the demons name outloud. Then her lover, the demon, revels himself as his original human form. She freaks out. He tries to convince her that she fell in love with him even tho he was a demon..he just had a different face...she doesn't care and she runs again...demon guy gets mad and tries to kill her..i see his face change monstrous with anger..then i woke up.<br></p>"

There was this lady who worked at an investigative reporter. She was responsible for finding her own stories. Anyway, she was newly married to an amazing attentive husband. They loved each other to extremes. She got let go from her job but felt that she could get it back if she found a good enough story. Her husband was find working and supporting them both but she didn't do well without a job. <br>There is a very important secret she does not know about her husband. He is a cold blooded murderer. It wasn't clear in the dream if he killed good people or bad people but I could feel his terror of his wife finding out. He was especially terrified of her finding out simply because it was in her nature to snoop and ask questions. She comes close to discovering something isn't quite right about him but he smiles and charms her and her love for him causes her to surpress her suspicions of him. Then I woke up.<br>I could see this being a story where I allow her to find out his secret and he begs her to help him but eventually he tries to kill her. She shoots him and it's the most excruciatingly painful thing she's ever had to endure but she realizes she's saved a lot of lives by ending his life.</p>"

I have a temp job as a receptionist. It may be permanent but I don't know and I don't want to get my hopes up. I need more money tho so I am applying at places that stay open 24 hours in order to get something in the wee hours of the morning. Not hopeful on the fruitition of that actually happening. 
As least I have *some* money coming in. Trying to save $3000 for a car which should take about 3-6 months to raise if I can find the discipline to not spend all my money. Not easy when you have a mood disorder that makes you want to spend spend spend.

I need my own car tho. As I figure it, I will not be able to survive without one.

I had the weirdest dream last nite. It was about my moms boyfriend who was such a huge asshole to me back when I still lived with my mom. I dreamed he and I were fighting and he was pushing or shoving me. I told my uncles that he hit me and they went after him. I didn't see what they actually did to him but they came back to the house covered in ridiculous amounts of blood. My uncle was driving a white van whose interior was covered in blood. They were mad at *me* for getting in the fight in the first place. I felt sort of scared yet extremely elated at the same time. Elated that that motherfucker got ""teh carnage"" bought on him and scared because of the amount of blood I could only safely assume that my uncles killed that motherfucker. Yet they said they were glad I didn't tell my brother because he would have surely hacked my mom's brother to pieces. I wonder why I even dreamt about that dumb fuck out of the blue like that."

I had a dream I was a prostitute and <i>loved</i> it. I don't know. Part of me hates men and another part wants to service them for money. Strange indeed. I can't wait to get myself back into dating mode. I am in don't-touch-me-with-a-10ft-pole mode right now. If someone shows interest or asks me for my number, I am appalled by their bad taste. 

Why are there all these shows on MTV that only seeks to change or reject people? Let's see there is a show called NEXT, which is like speed dating, except there is only one person dating a bunch of losers. If you aren't good enough, you get ""nexted"". Some people get rejected after 1 or 2 seconds, before they even open their mouths. Then their is something called Meet My Parents, or something, I am not sure of the title. This is where the person is already dating someone but their parents try to set them up with someone ""better"". There is ""Made"", where they try to change some poor loser into something ""better"" of their choice. This is the most devasting show. So far I have seen them change not ONE but TWO NIN fans into beauty/prom queens. Very scary. Next there is a show called ""Why Can't I Be You?"" where they try to change someone into someone they've admired from a far. This show isn't as bad because they sometimes turn people into something less superficial, even if they can't help but mention that they are going backwards. And it is interesting to see the admiree not be totally freaked out by the whole ""CAN I BE YOU!!"" loser that has been mildly stalking them for who knows how long. 
 So many shows focusing on not accepting who you are as a person and trying to change into something that is somehow more acceptable. Trying to prove something to someone else (I am not a nerd, I am not a freak, I am not a wimp, I am not fat... ) It goes on and on. I think they also have a show dedicated to Fat Camp, watching teenagers go to a summer camp to lose weight. I swear, MTV is a slimy tarpit of TV programming. Fuck MTV, indeed."

During the moments right before I am about to wake up, I realize all the things that were making so much perfect sense in the dream world, were completely nonsensical and fantastical in the real world. It's sort of disconcerting. Sometimes I come up with amazing songs or storylines only to wake up and find they make absolutely no sense. It's weird. Maybe its telling me its about time to partake in somekind of mental endeavor. I don't know.

My mind is on holiday and refusing to get off the beach and come back to work. I even got a horoscope saying I was failing in some kind of mental chore or whatever. I totally understand calculus. I do. It makes sense to me, but when I do it, i just don't want to think about the more difficult parts. Which aren't that difficult, but you still have to be thinking to get it right and all i can accomplish is a state right above comatose. I don't know what's wrong with me. I spent the entire weekend sleeping or reading when I should have been studying my ass off. I did manage to study for 5 minutes. I figured out a whole section and did three problems and was like ""i'll do the rest when I get home"" that was 2:45 minutes ago. I looked for my pencil and couldn't find it and then I decided to search the net, and here I am.

Why do the smartest people do the STUPIDEST things? Why? Why? Why? It's like:

Me: So you discovered the secret to time travel, is that correct?
Genius: Correct.
Me: Ok. So I heard your gf fucked your bestfriend in your bed while you were in the hospital recovering from a serious operation, yet you still want to be with her? Why?
Genius: She didn't mean it. I know she loves me. It was just a moment of weakness..and blah de blah blah.

I swear, all human beings are like that. I will never understand. I never stay in hurtful relationships for too long. Why is that? Too much common sense? I don't know. I am pretty lonely tho but right now I guess I am disillusioned enough to think I am better off. 

Wayne wants to get married. He wants the instant family my older bro has. *Sigh*. He is just like my father and I don't have the heart to tell him. My dad never had any money or the things he needed to get by in life because he kept giving and giving to women. Now my brother is barely scraping by and no one knows why. I know why. Its because he is sending money to his chickenhead fiance. I know he is because my sis-in-law heard her bragging about the money he gives her. Just like the chickenhead who has been mooching off my dad for SEVENTEEN years, my brother goes out and wants to marry the FIRST gold digger he meets!! It's just weird. They say girls marry their fathers, which is okay with me, but I didn't know sons could marry their father's mistresses."

I'm tired of being hot. I get eczema EVERY summer. Horrible eczema all over my forearms. It is where the sun touches my skin.  I don't know why the sun affects my skin so badly during the summer. Less ozone layer protection? All I know is it started the first year I went to band camp and has come back every summer since then. For 10 years. Back then, I would scratch and scratch until my skin cracked and bled. By mid-October, I would be completely healed with no scars.

I hate summer. I hate being hot. I hate being itchy. The cortizone is barely helping this year, also.

I read in a book that eczema is caused by having antagonistic feelings. Hahha. Im going to deal with this for the rest of my life. How can you go thru life not feeling like you just want to KILL somebody??!! It's just not possible."

I hate school. I think I am suffering from school overload. I have been  going to school for  1 year straight with no breaks. I am hopelessly failing and I am only taking TWO classes. How can I take four classes and get A's in 3 of them and then take only two classes and have an average in the 50s by midterm?????
I'm taking easy classes, too. Calculus and Probability and Statistics. They are pretty alike because they are the first math classes I have taken that can actually be applied to the real world. Well, College Algebra had one or two formulas I could use in the business world, but that's not the point. I understand Calculus. It seems pretty simple to me but I am not doing the homework and fucking up on the questions he puts on the tests where there is no real math. Then, I am fucking up the basic math when it comes to adding and subtracting exponents OH and im fucking up the trig. These problems would be easily solved if I just practiced deriving and wrote out all the trig stuff and programmed them into my calculator but I just can't get myself to do it. Instead I read novels, watch tv, listen to cds, and write boring livejournal entries to ""prepare"" myself for the grueling work. Aye. It doesn't matter anyway. I've already been accepted to CSU.
I'll just take calculus next semester if I can't at least pull of a C this one. Its so pathetic. Ive rented cd-roms and videos for calc thinking it was going to be SOOOOO hard. I guess it gets worse as you go on. I am really only just starting.

I am planning to apply for an internship at AdultSwim. They require that you presently be a junior in college. My brother in Atlanta,GA lives about 15 miles from their offices. I don't mind living with the control freak as long as I get to be close to the people responsible for putting shows like the Boondocks and ATHF on tv for my viewing pleasure. I swear, I am staying up all nite with the forms filled out and my mouse on the send button so that I'm ready as soon as the deadline for submissions begins. 
If I don't get the internship there, I will apply for temp work or an internship at some other company in atlanta. Aren't there a buttload of record companies there? Dunno, gotta check that out. If I can't be greatness, at least I can get greatness their coffee."

Things are looking pretty bleak and right now things are really bugging me. I went out of town to orientation at Charleston Southern University, which I will be attending instead of USC (which was the school of my hopes and dreams) because I don't want to be anywhere around my mother and I hate Columbia. I really miss Charleston. Oh, also because USC's campus sucks and I have enough problems with transport.
Anyway, after spending hours at CSU and leaving with a fucked up schedule, no ID, no financial aid, and the wrong SOC # on file which messed up my Financial Aid and not talking to the dean about staying on campus. Just nothing got done. I get home to find my computer completely blank with nothing but the cursor blinking. It won't do anything. After cutting it off and on for a bit, it says it doesn't recognize the hard drive. I scream at my mom. I don't know what she did, but the computer is completely wiped out. I've only been gone TWO DAYS!! 
I am using the laptop my brother got me right now to type this. NO WAY am I EVER letting anyone use this laptop but ME!

I have to buy  another hard drive for $80 and I have no money. I was trying to figure out how to get the $80 that I need to upgrade the memory on my computer. I just feel like someone took my $1600 computer and poured water in it. I know its not the end of the world, but it is jsut another kick in the guts after a very bad and disappointing weekend.

At CSU, the advisor who was registering me in classes acted like she just wanted me out the door. She put me in Business Law II when I haven't even taken Business Law I yet and I don't even think my major requires that class - she didn't even ask me the emphasis in my major. I had to correct her like 6 times while she putting me in classes. It really all fucked up. I have a class that ends at like 12 noon and not another class until 3pm. What am I suppose to do for THREE hours?? I guess that fine if you live on campus but I probably won't be. She also has me scheduled a 1 day a week class from 6-9pm - making it impossible for me to have a job. Plus, who wants to sit in one class for a three hour stretch, even if it is just for one day a week? I checked the schedules and the same class meets for one hour three days a week and earlier in the morning. I am just going to ask her to enable me to schedule my classes online myself and NEVER sit back and let anyone do my schedule for me. :(:(
Should I be nasty with her when I finally get her on the phone? I sort of understand that she had like 50 students and it takes her like 20 minutes per student she would never get to them all on time, but is that an excuse to totally fuck me over on my schedule? 
I turned in my schedule to the bookstore also with possible classes I probably won't be needing. 
It'll probably work itself out. Even the computer thing. I was thinking of leaving the computer to my mom anyway, so who cares if it's comput. I just don't have a way to watch my DVDs (privately) or burn cds anymore. :*("

I've just logged onto my student account and am glad to say that I have finally passed the required courses of Spanish. Obliteration of all of the Spanish language from my memory COMMENCES NOW!
Oh, I have also finished my history course requirements. So that adds foreign language and history to the list of subjects I will never have to suffer through again.
Do other college kids have such a list? I bet they don't even think about it. It's easy for others, it seems - what I have to agonize through. Oh well.
I have just TWO more math courses and I'll be completely educated when it comes to math - never having to take another math course. Which means I only get to do the fun stuff which I have decided will be:
Business and Criminal Justice.
 I've done a bit of research and found out that security agencies such as the CIA, FBI, and NSA are in need of business graduates. So I've decided to get an MBA while minoring in Criminal Justice. Sort of playing with the idea of trying to get into it as a field agent (or whatever they are called) but that seems way too much like joining the military..blah. I like my freedom (or illusion of it) way to much to do that.
I'll be going to CSU on a probationary basis. Basically, I'm going to see how I like it there and decide whether I want to transfer or not. The best school in SC is USC but it's campus is horrendously spread sporadically all over the city. Kids either trek for many city blocks or drive to their classes. They have buses but they are not convienent. It just seems like too much stress. CSU, on the other hand, is nice and neatly just one huge block buildings. Their classes, dorms, stadium, and baseball field is all right there on the same ground. I can walk from one end of the campus to the other without having to cross one street.  I like that. It's also a Christian based school and I like that for some reason. Well, I don't like the fact that I am forced to take one course on religion, but I do like that they stress values. Unlike USC, whose student body is full of drunks and skanks - the girls walk around in short shorts with the word COCKS on their ass (their mascot is the gamecock)! It was funny the first couple of times, but now its just like.. i don't want to hang with them on the weekends, you know? I guess I'm just old fashioned that way. Or maybe I'm older now and over it. Who knows?

Plus, I'm looking forward to finally going back to Charleston. I have no qualms about leaving my mom to fend for herself. She still hasn't got a job. I will be nice and continue to pay for her cable. Basic through, I'm disconnecting the digital when I leave.

I am also going to dabble in the entertainment industry. I sort of would like to write for television and am thinking of writing some scripts. They say the way to go about this is to write a script for a show that already exists... so I'm playing around with that. Also going to sign up for a course in directing next semester. They let you direct an one act play at the end of the year. Looking forward to that.. or learning about it. I have no desire to become an actor, I want to create.
I wonder how you get into writing scripts or story lines for video games. That would be so cool.

I can't believe the PS3 isn't coming out until November!!! I guess I have to replace the ps2 that that crackhead stole. I can't wait until November to get my game on. :(
Final Fantasy 7:Advent Children kicks ass!!! And I plan to play all the vid game remakes!!! Makes silly life worth living, I tell you. I remember skipping school and playing FF7 all. day. long. Ah, memories.

oh, as for music. NearLy SUCKS. I was so excited when I read the reviews that said it is like a continuation of NIN's The Fragile. It so isn't. It's not even worthy of being called shit. It's more like watery diarreah. Fuck Jerome Dillon. I should have known his album would suck because of that one time I asked him what he was listening to and he gave me this long list of pretentious emo-rock bands no ones ever heard of. NEARLY SUCKS.
I'm so disappointed.

I bought some old time Esthero replacing the one I ripped off the net a few years ago. I'm afraid to buy her lastest album. I got the Ep and it only has one good song on it.
I'm getting the new Korn and Red Hot Chili Pepper's cds this weekend. Looking forward to that. It sucks that they don't sell Jakalope on this side of the border cuz they have a new album out with Trent Reznor as producer. I don't know what that means. Hey, didn't TR produce Manson? Too lazy to go look at the cd liner notes right now, but I think he did and if he did, then thats a good thing. I gotta get it imported.
I will NOT be buying the new Tool or Pearl Jam albums. ICK Ministry - maybe.

I wish I had a better internet connection so I could rip off some JRock. This American crap isn't cutting it anymore and the japenese rockers are so very much more cuter. 

Im in the weirdest robot like mood right now.

Ive realised how dead inside I am. Or am I? I don't know. Im very isolated. I go days and days without seeing or talking to anyone. All I really need is TV,books, and music, and hell, Im happy. Is that a bad thing?

See, I'd be perfect as some sort of agent. I can travel all over the world months at a time and have no family at home to miss. I could get killed or whatever and no one would care, making me completely dispensible. I basically have nothing to truly live for, isn't that the best kind of person when it comes to those sort of things? Oh, and I hate criminals with a passion. I sort of don't even like people who do recreational drugs, but thieves really piss me off for some reason.
Not making anymore sense... I'm done."

"event","my head felt all fuzzy and disconnected today. i dont know why. i haven't been feeling as fatigued as i was feeling the last quarter of last year. i have energy! without taking any supplements! except for today's fuzziness which is probably an effect of me thinking that since i have more energy during the day, i can go to bed later. i went to bed at 130 and i have been floating up in the clouds all day. making all sorts of weird mistakes in my thinking and being sort of out of it. so i guess i have to go to bed soon.

i havent been able to get all my school work done. i hate myself for just not being able to do it. well i am doing some of it. im kicking college trigonometry's ass. i was ahead in trig, but now im sort of behind but not as behind as i am in philosophy (three loooooooooong ass chapters AND a research paper), human development (four looooooooong ass chapters), and spanish (looooooots of studying because i havent yet remembered all the preterite tenses for the regular not less the irregular verbs). I have so many classes that I have to stop and think of what im even doing these days. I have been unable to keep up with myself. I have missed a lot of work in human dev and will probably be dropped from that class. it doesn't matter, ill still be able to graduate but if im not dropped, i will get a c because i missed a quiz.
My philosophy prof informed today that i must meet with the dept head in order not to be dropped from his class. He says ""blahblah you are a very smart lady..blahblahblah because i value your presence in this class im not going to drop you but instead send you to my boss blahblahblah, she'll give you an assignment to do in order to stay in the class"" I felt like saying ""hah, too bad *i* don't value my presence in this class"" i really hate going to that class. he teaches us absolutely nothing but instead wastes our time going on tangents about shit that has nothing to do with the course. :| Which is why i took my time getting to class and sometimes too much time and ending up being late and getting marked absent. woops. i need to stop this self-destructive pattern. im way too old for it. its a vicious cycle. :(

on the other hand, im preparing to go to CSU and my old school wont send the transcripts (they sent the transcripts to the school im going to now with no prob). They wont send the transcripts because I owe them $802 from when i withdrew early after getting my financial aid refund. i had to withdraw because i was going thru my first major depressive episode and i really wasnt in a position to be ""responsible"" and pay them back so i didnt. its ironic how they wont send the transcript now that it *really* matters to me!
CSU says they will go ahead and review an unofficial copy of the transcript and accept me provisionally. I still have to pay up to do anything more than that, tho.

i want to be accepted to csu and i may look into staying in the dorms, i dont know. im tired of living with my money grubbing parents. i will never get on my own feet if i have to constantly be supplemental income for them. :( my dad  and i talked about it and he said that i could stay with him until i saved enough enough money to buy furniture and make a downpayment on my own place but of course he added ""but if i needed some money in an emergency, of course im going to get it from you""
i once gave my dad $1000 of cold hard cash all at once. guess how long it took for him to spend every last cent. not very long. guess how much of it he gave me back. nothing. I even gave him $300 once and i dont even know what he did with it. nowadays he does send me $20 or $40 here or there, but nothing like what i gave him. i just know that once i have enough money saved, he will get in a crisis and need ALL of it. 

last month i gave my mom $250 because she needed to pay her house taxes. if i can save $400 this month and at least $200 next month, i believe that i can have enough money to buy clothes for work (my plan is to get a job and dress NICELY in order have better chances of getting a better paying job...instead of dressing halfassed like i usually do and getting nowhere). But as soon as I had a lot of money I thought Id get to keep she asks me for $200 for nothing! Just because she wants it! She says its because she pays all the bills and blahblahblah. If i could afford to pay her bills, i wouldnt be here. I understand that she doesnt have a job and is living off her trustfund and doesnt have money left over after her bills, but i do help her out ( i pay the water bill and the cable bill and i buy various stuff she needs throughout the month). she thinks she deserves ALL my extra cash. I dont have a car and i barely have any clothes. i need my money so i can get myself out of this rut. itll probably never happen tho. what irks me the most is that if my mother got a measly parttime job, she'd be set! she'd be able to get a car, buy clothes and everything! If she got a fulltime job, she'd be pretty well off. But she won't do it. She won't get a job at certain places she feels is below her and she cant get a office job that she wants because her skills are subpar. she's stuck and i dont want to be stuck with her. she's so lucky she's not out on the street.
i still have to pay $800 and im not really sure how im going to do that or if i will in time to be registered as CSU. 

also, i had to get a loan for summer school. i need to graduate this summer in order to transfer to the university. the money i have is from being a work study student and i think thats based on your financial aid, but im not getting fin. aid this summer.. im going to school on a loan.. so im worried that i may not get work study this summer. if i dont, ill have to put off graduating and get a job. theres no way i can do both because i dont have a car :*(

how will i ever get out on my own? i just don't know. i have so many doubts about the future and nothing really to look forward to."

"event","im totally skipping philosophy this morning and completely wasting my time.
i have tons of work and i just can't even get a smidge of it done. at least im not as depressed as i was the last quarter of last year. blah.
i dunno. kind of drifting. trying to figure out what keeps people going.
what if our lives aren't any more important than the ants we step on?
when i realize that this planet is just a ball floating in the air, in puts things in perspective but it kind of makes me panic. like... i want to put my feet on ""solid ground"" but there IS no solid ground.. anywhere... im destined to float forever! (the ground does not exist! the ground does not exist!)

shit is funny. i don't know. im just shaking my head. i really don't care if i don't see another day.
but if we are just ants and nothing means anything, how fucking lucky are we just to be conscious? incredibly lucky.

last nite i dreamt my mother had this huge knife and cut her own throat and i sort of stopped and called 911 and i was like ""let her bleed a little"" before i SLOWLY went to get a towel to wrap around her throat. yah, its like that now.

i need to be apart of something bigger than myself. something interesting. it probably won't happen.


this is really small bananas but interesting all the same. it doesn't make me realize anything i don't already know but its pretty cool anyway and i sort of want to remember it.
anyway, ok, the lead dood of nin, my fav band, has been posting on this nin board im sometimes go to (incognito, if you try to tell anyone its him, they start dialing the people in the white coats for you) .. anyway.. shit went crazy and OTHER previous members of his band were posting crazy shit on the board last nite. Why can't i like nickelback or falloutboy or some shit like that? I have to be obsessed with a band that acts like a bunch of 14 year old cheerleaders FOR real. Anyway, hah, yah so they don't have anything to do but pick fights with each other IN front of their fans on the internet. wtf.

anyway, charlie clouser, ex keyboardist, posted this and i want to copy it before trent convinces the moderators of the message board to delete it:

charlieclouser:
Good Lord, I would have thought these kids had grown up by now! You hear how TR and Jayrome going off on each other, it's like ""whaaaahhh whaaahhh!"". Fuck. 

First off, TR don't owe me SHIT. I don't feel like I've been wronged or got a raw deal out of NIN, I motherfucking SCORED being in that band. 

As did we all, as did we all........ 

It's been five years since I'm out, so, okay, you guys want the straight dope, here it is. (deep breath) 

To Jay-rome... 

Jay-rome, bro, dude...... You're a great drummer. That's cool. You might have made a really interesting record (ain't heard it yet), which is even cooler. 

But, hello, ummm...... how well do you know TR, anyway? Does any of this surprise you, bro? Do you remember how it went down when various other people left the band? Weren't you there the day I left, when TR found a few things of mine still in the studio, and threw them in the freaking dumpster while I'm standing right there by my car? IN THE DUMPSTER? And all I did was shake my head and say to myself, ""dude has got some issues...."" 

Remember, this was after I cowrote, remixed, and programmed way more shit than you ever did. Remember, I also made the live tapes? I also did the remixes on FDTS. I also programmed shit on TDS and The Fragile. I also brought Starfuckers, Inc. to the table, remember? That ain't no motherfucking bassline, fool, that's my QuasiMidi Rave-O-Lution 309 beatbox! AND those vocal fx dawg. 

My reaction: ""Whatever, dude. I'm out. Later for you and your harshness."" 

You didn't see how he fucking shut Chris Vrenna down. Goddamn motherfucking PodBoy had been with TR since the ramen-noodle years, running down to CompUSA every week to buy TR more video games, sitting there reading from the cheats book while TR played Doom for hours, never giving Pod a chance to play, and fucking sitting in the driver's seat in the studio for more than ten years. At the end of that decade, while TR is buying a fucking man$ion, he was paying Pod like $60k. All Pod wanted was a little piece of the action to go along with his salary. Like a fucking nickel off the net dollar on swag. Like maybe a point on the record. No fucking way, TR and Malm told Pod that he was now 'surplus to requirements' and put his ass in the wind. After TEN FUCKING YEARS! Pod is the one who should bitch, not you. Pod is the one that should have been singin', ""We built this city on rock 'n roll, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!"". 

So you wonder why he didn't call you in the hospital? Fuck, dude... TR needs to watch out for TR and the rest of you can take a flying fuck at a rolling donut, and you're just now figuring this out? You thought that since you two were best butt-buddies for a while, that you guys were gonna be bros in later years? 

You're lucky they didn't pull your luggage off the bus and drop it at the hospital! 

Dude, everyone who's ever been in NIN or worked for (there is no WITH) Trent has been butt-buddy at some point. We all rode shotgun in his green porsche while he talked the big talk, and we all believed it, some for longer than others. 

The only reason I ever moved to NOLA was because TR told me, straight up, that he wanted me and danny to write the tracks for a Tapeworm album, on which I would get a production credit. 

This was in 1995. NINETEEN NINETY FUCKING FIVE, DUDE! 

Remember, I was just starting to write the first Rob Zombie album, when TR conned me into moving to NOLA on the basis of Tapeworm. I was living in 7200 square feet in Nichols Canyon, with the protools rigs of doom. My game was ALREADY TIGHT nucca. 

I took a pretty major pay cut to join NIN, and the only reason was because of the fantasy Tapeworm bonus. We knew it was never going to happen years before you showed up. It became a big joke for me and Danny (but not a very funny one). Robin never believed that shit for a second, he was out of there right after the tour ended. 

So, after all this, you get to say, ""I used to be in nine inch nails."" Isn't that enough for you? That ought to be worth something, yeah? Work that shit, homey, but don't you ever try to hold TR to his word on fantasy shit like Tapeworm or ""I'll produce your record..."" 

He's the guy that invites you over for a bbq and gets all sullen when you take two hamburgers instead of one, but don't let it get to you. Eat both of 'em! Fuckit! 

But here's the moral of this harsh story: 

The important part now is to not become like him. 

Shake it off, man. Deep breath. You fucking carry that bitterness for TR with you thru life, man, you will poison yourself from the inside. TR always claiming he's dark, he got a black soul, saying shit like ""you know me, I hate EVERYONE!"" 

Ooooohhh ain't he tuff. SuperTuff. SuperDuperTuff. He so motherfuckin dark he make you look light by comparison, nucca. 

Well, what if all that shit he claimin' is actually TRUE? What if he really IS that hateful person that he describes in all them dark lyrics? If he IS that guy, then he needs his head examined or removed ASAP. Man, forget that shit as soon as you can. People get what they deserve in the end, man, they reap what they sow. They get the kind of freinds they deserve. 

Remember how record labels would call Nothing Records or Conservative Management looking to get me to do a remix, and Malm would make sure I never got the message? I found out about all that shit when I got back to LA, how all these fools be like, ""Where you been? We been leaving messages at Nothing Records for like two years! They wouldn't give us your number, or the number at the studio in NOLA, so WTF is up with that?"" And I'm like, ""John MotherFucking Malm is what's up with that."" 

So yeah, I got fired out of there on zero notice. TR put my sorry ass in the wind too. 

And I don't look back. 

Would I do it all over again? Yeah, but I would have been right behind Robin on the way back to LA instead of waiting four more years for shit that wasn't ever gonna happen. That last tour we did was a joke, and you know it. Fucking TR forgetting lyrics onstage, Robin taking a swing at TR in Australia, shit I was ready to walk off stage and take a cab to the airport that one time in Japan when he just lying on stage drunk off his ass mumbling instead of singing. 

Now he all on 'roid rage, he could snap me like a twig, but back then was a different story. Remember that Japanese chick with the missing teeth when we went to the temples in Kyoto? Fuck. 

How many people can you name who would honestly say that they think TR has been a real friend across the years? Some of his high school buddies that come out on tour, or Clint, maybe, but that's cause they never really ""worked"" together. I saw Clint coming out of the dressing room at the Bowl smiling, so they obviously all good, but I wasn't even allowed to say hi to TR. I got the blockade from security! Hahahahah LoLLerskates *HUGZ* ROFL ain't that some shit? 

All's I wanted to say was, ""congrats on the new album, new tour, and new YOU! TR, you look TIGHT and your game is seriously ON, man, and I am psyched for you. You obviously conquered some heavy shit, and you gotta feel good, yeah?"" Not like I'm gonna complain about shit from five years ago backstage, right? 

Hey also, didn't I hear TR talking some shit about how he 12-stepped his way back to planet earth? Well, I ain't never 12-stepped myself, but I got a couple close friends who did, and the one thing they all said was part of the process was to go back and apologize or make amends with all who were hurt by your actions while you were under the influence of whatever you're 12-stepping out of. 

Did TR ever drop one motherfucking dime? PodBoy never got that call. I know you didn't get that call.... I didn't need one, since I played his ass right back as he was playing mine, but PodBoy got the short end of the long stick. Well, maybe he only made it through 11 out of the 12 steps....... but I don't know nothing about 12 steps. (oh yeah, I am clean, but it only took one step.) 

(BTW: You're better off not being in a band that plays medleys...) 

Now, before y'all go thinking I feel all ""wronged"" by TR, I don't. I am absolutely fine with him. I sussed the deal soon enough, and it WAS a cushy situation, so I let it ride for a while, and I hung around while I got my act together to re-enter LA. Soon as I felt like he was short-changin' me, I said, ""Shit, I gotta get me a night job!"" Had to finish the demos for the Helmet album while still on TR's payroll, ya unnerstand? So I managed to extract value from the transaction, even if it wasn't the value I thought going in. So we cool, I know he threw my shit in the dumpster cause I was writing Helmet and remixing Zombie on his dime, but shit, man, the way I deal is to say, ""don't be motherfucking remixing Zombie on my dime bitch!"" right to a sucker's face instead of throwing they shit in the dumpster, run back in the studio, and change the locks. 

So TR, I know you gonna see this, and hate on me, and it's cool. I know you gonna whip out the pics of me and Lifto and the carrot, or video of my ""initiation"" backstage in Long Island, or some other embarrassing shit. Bring it, I don't give a fuck. I got no probs with you dude and you can diss me all you want. I'm happy for ya man, you making it work big time. Plus, you're mr. artistic integrity guy, and I do cheesy horror movies, so who the fuck am I? 

So you got it all over me, yeah. I ain't on your level, and I ain't never gonna BE on your level. 

And all was right and as it should be in the world..... 

And I am OUT. Later."

I went out with my friends in charleston last weekend and i was soooooooooo bored. karoake was fun, tho.

im forgetting how to spell things :(

tyra banks is really pissing me off. She is always doing shows about women with undesirable body types. I have not seen just one or two shows like this but I caught the bitch at it like three or four times.. There was the show where she had fat women draw themselves in chalk, the show where she had fat women come out and talk about being fat, and the show where she even went as far as putting on a fat suit herself just to see what it would be like to be fat!! Get OVER IT! I saw a show a few years ago where she bragged that she doesn't have to diet or exercise to be skinny. gawd i hate her... and i really want to like her for some reason.. maybe because i know she is only trying to help but gawd. I hope they cancel her show soon.

i stopped dieting and taking dieting pills. and guess what! I lost a few more pounds for some reason. o_O i just that was ironic. i was so convinced that i needed some kind of aid in losing weight. i dont care if im fat or not anymore. im not really caring about much these days.

ive been really bored. watching a lot of tv. not much thought going on upstairs. i think its because this last semester was like putting my brain in a blender. this time next year i should be going to university. i wonder what it will be like. i will be the oldest person there, i bet. (it doesnt matter, people still think im in highschool.) i want to be around the younger kids for some reason. its weird. ill just lie about my age when im in school so i wont have to relate how a silly job and depression kept me in and out of school for so many years.

ive given up on being skinny. being happy. having a boyfriend. having a car. everything. i just dont care anymore. school is just something to pass the time. i dont enjoy it anymore. i have to ask myself why anybody does anything when they are just going to die anyways. 

its hard to keep myself going. i find myself thinking i should say something or do something then i think.. what if i just didn't? then i don't and its not so bad. i see everything i ever wanted going into the hands of others so why even try anymore. it just seems futile.


i made an A in all subjects this semester instead of spanish. which is ironic because after i took the last exam, i walked out of class happy that id never have to translate another word of spanish or write another stupid ass spanish composition and then i find out i got a D!!! :((((((( i really hate spanish. it just seems like a dirty language to me. everytime i speak or see it, i think of little dirty mexican men at construction sites. i can smell the red dirt and grim on them. it makes me sick to my stomach. it doesnt help that the spanish professor sort of resembles one of these grimy little mexicans. i tried to put myself in another professor's class but he is the only one who teaches early enough at the campus i go to. i haaaaaaaaaaaate spanish. probably for totally racist reasons but oh well. 

im realizing how much i cant stand my mother. the only love i possibly have for her is bred out of pity. as soon as i can, im leaving and i will have nothing to do with her. i will convince my siblings not to give her one red cent ever again (she can barely pay her bills and doesnt have a job - instead she lives off a trust fund). im at the point where i really dont give a shit about her. i cant wait for the day she calls me up asking for money and i can tell her never to call me ever again and that she doesn't exist to me anymore. that i consider my dad's 12 year old mistress to be a better mother than her. something spiteful like that. i really can't wait."

I hate to see what the rest of my grades are going to be like. This was the hardest semester for me in my student career, even without the Trig class. *sigh*

I met a bunch of guys and am getting a lot of messages via myspace but I *still* don't have anyone to talk to. The guys I gave my number to haven't called yet. Men suck. I am trying.

The other day this guy in a nice sleek Lexus drove up and asked me to get in the car with him. It was raining and cold. I don't know why I didn't. Its not like I have anything to lose but life and i don't value that that much. If I had gotten in, at least it would have made shit more interesting. Another stupid mistake."

One person is suppose to do the research, another the writing, and then the last person actually builds the website. So far, I have done the research by myself, the writing, and I went ahead and spent all day building the freaking website. I emailed my professor about it looking like no one was doing anything but me and he freaking IGNORES me!! During online class last night he sat and asked everybody else about their project but me! So I will be busting my ass compiling my research to complete writing at least two or three 1200 word essays for this stupid website all by my goddamn self because the fucking professor apparently isn't going to give me the option of doing something else on my own this late in the game. I don't know why I care so much. Probably because of the horrible essays and the FOUR novels I had to read for this stupid class and I don't want to have to go through all of that again under any circumstances. The project counts for 30% of my grade, so I don't have the option of not doing it and still getting a decent grade. :*(
 I'm a horrible acedemic writer for some reason now. It used to be so easy to find the right words, now it takes me hours to write my essays. I think its all the second hand smoke or something or I am just dumb because I'm older. 
 It really upsets me that people treat me like so much shit. Even a freaking college professor who doesn't even know me."

"event","some sucky poems i wrote for my creative writing final:
Insomnia

Many days and nights it keeps me up.
It has claws razor sharp with fear
teeth dripping with terror. 
I know now that it will one day 
hold me in its grip.

I watch the clock as time passes
the ticking away of days, hours, minutes, seconds
marks the time which it stalks me
never missing a step with my step
beat by beat

One day it will catch me
breath will stop and then darkness takes over
I will cease to know everything
the clock will beat steadily on
while I walk on the other side


Memories


Vivid or imaginary memories clog the brain
from Infancy to Adulthood, we collect them
They teach us how to protect ourselves
what to touch and who not to love
They walk with us when no one else will

Tell us where we have been 
Let us better appreciate where we are now
Install in us a sense of pride or
awash us in the grayness of shame
Takes us to a better place

and shows us the vibrant colors
Some are distinct crystal clear
Others vague shadowy murky
Everyday they gather together
I wish I had better ones



The Way of My Life


I am amazed by the way time passes.
One day I am four years old and playing 
with pieces of grass.
I am impressed by the tiny lines that
shoot themselves up and down the fresh green blades.
I smell the air full of sun and springtime.
I chase and innocently capture bumblebees by hand.
One day, I catch a bee and it risks its life to sting me. 
And this will be the way of my life for years to come.
I never learn until I get stung.
Next memory, I am seven years old.
Its my birthday and I am at McDonalds.
I am surrounded by strange children and sugary
colorful decorated cake.
I await the arrival of the Man Himself
Ronald McDonald. He doesn't show. Instead, he
sends his friend Grimace. 
And this will be the way of my life for years to come. 
Men will always disappoint me. 
Next memory, I am twelve years old and I'm in school.
I sit by the window daydreaming. 
That day we were being taught how to hold a pencil correctly. 
I still don't know how to do this. 
The nail of my right ring finger will never grow correctly.
This will be the way of my life for years to come.
I never pay attention when something important is going on.



Upside Down World


The things you want the most has the highest price.
Your greatest problem, ignored instead of solved.
The people you need the most are never there.
Information highway dumbs you down instead of educates.
Life is hard when it should be simple and easy.

Children starve to death while food stockpiles rot and sour.
Earn lots of money only to save it towards never.
Eat healthy and exercise to die one day anyway.
Whatever feels good is probably bad for you.
Take medicine because of medicinal side-effects.

The people you like the most don't like you.
The more sex you have the less satisfied you are. 
Watch the poor starve while the rich pay for lipo.
The educators go broke, the millionaires throw balls.
The more you need, the less you will have.




Seasonal Affective Disorder

The leaves are turning again
I turn with them
They lose their leaves
I gain another layer of cloth

The days are getting shorter
I close up earlier
They sun goes down faster
I go to sleep before six

The air gets cooler
I get colder too
The winter air is coming
I start to shun others

The last season of the year
I lose my momentum
The year is winding down
I lose energy for life

Things die to begin anew
This time of year, I die too
The trees look barren
I switch medications"

"event","I am experiencing a bit of confusion with my boyslut. I understand that he is a slut and I even encourage his manslut ways. I encourage them because I understand who he is, why he is that way, and what.. i just know the how,what,when,where, and why of his personality(too much to attempt to explain). I have known him for many years. He is goodlooking but not extremely so but his heart makes up for it. Anyway, what I am trying to get at is I don't think all the girls he talks to understands the basic innerworkings of his mind. They try to stake him as their property when he cannot be owned (at least not at this time in his life). He is not doing a good job of explaining this to them. (How does a guy tell a girl he is only interesting in one thing when it comes to her? He won't because he is afraid he will be denied that very thing) Therefore, he is making a fool of them. What I need for him to know is that I am NOT one of these fools. I am not and never will be a fool for him or anyone. I need to make him understand this... soon. 
But what will he think of me if I accept that he goes with other girls. See, I know this is not really want he wants.. full acceptance.. he wants me to act jealous and posessive.. why? Because this inflates his almost non-existent self-esteem. He probably gains extreme pleasure from frustrating women. If I let him know that it's impossible to make me jealous or angry, will he lose interest? Dammit. Everything tells me he will.. I mean, why play a game when there really isn't one to play in the first place. 
  I thought he was what I was looking for.. someone mature enough to just enjoy each other and leave it at that.. but I don't need someone who thrives on drama. I guess maybe I just answered my own question but I am still going to try and find a way around this. *sigh*"

"event","I went to Atlanta to hang out with my brothers and my brother Tyrone's  family. I have four nephews by him: an 18 year old (step-nephew), 12 year old, and a 6 and 4 year old. My brother Terrance is living with my brother Tyrone. What is wrong with my generation that we can't take care of ourselves. Only one person I know my age that lives by herself and that is my friend Suzanne. The rest of us are still holed up with parents or stuggling to get on our feet. ALL but one of us. It's sad and very discouraging. 
  Anyway, Thanksgiving was spent at my cousin Stacey's house where I only knew about 7 of the 30 people that were there. My cousin Stacey has a HUGE house but his yard is all fucked up.. its extremely step and you feel like you are going up and down the side of a mountain when walking across the yard. But it was still a nice house and was lakeview. Dinner was okay but I would have rather been home. No one had anything to say to me, why is that? Probably because I am practically the living dead.
  The day after Thanksgiving, Friday, we went to look at (not buy) toys and then took two hours driving trying to find a place to eat. I didn't eat that much. It felt weird going out to eat the day after Thanksgiving but my brother said it was tradition for the family to eat out on Friday. 
  On Saturday, my sister-in-law tricked me into going shopping. I guess she figured if she had asked me if I wanted anything I would have said no, so she just took me. (She and my brother know people very well) So I was tricked into buying about five outfits, a new purse (sis-in-law said she just HATED my old one), a belt, two pairs of shoes, and two bottles of perfume. I miss having money to spend indiscriminately like that. All in all, my brother (it was his money she was spending) spent over $150 on me because he didn't like the jeans I was wearing. They are pretty old and beat up. I didn't get the usual high created by shopping like I do when I spend my own money. I guess I still felt guilty or something. I would have rather stayed home then spend all that money. Also, my brother is forever saying he is broke and they never have any money on them. Then I over hear that my sis-in-law gave Stacey's wife almost $200 for money owed on clothes and other stuff that she gave them! The thing is my mom is forever struggling to pay bills and they won't help her with a dime. I pay two of the bills and I only get $500 a month. I wish they would help out but I guess I shouldn't be looking a gift horse in the mouth.
 After all the shopping, my brother comes up to me and tells me never to be afraid to ask for stuff because I never do. See, I used to ask him to help me out every now and then.. esp when I was about to lose my car a few years ago (which I lost anyway) but he always said no because he had four kids to feed so I just stopped asking him. So when I don't ask, I get, I guess.
 My sis-in-law also braided my hair. I felt like a little baby, all the things they were doing for me and couldn't wait to get back home. I figured I was a inconvience but my sis-in-law said she enjoyed my company when it was time to leave. I sort of believe her.

  I am feeling so hopeless these days. Nothing seems worth the energy of living. I don't want to go on anymore and it's hard to find a reason to."

Somehow tho, I am still getting my school work done enough to pass. I thank heaven for that much.... (but all I have to do is school, so no wonder)."

it sucks feeling your own.. .mortality.. knowing your going to die, probably painfully and it will probably take a long time. I just don't know how people do it. I doubt I will stick around and wait for it to happen. I know I won't. I can't. 

I have to wait a very long time before I get to enjoy life again. I guess some people think my suffering is funny. I don't know what to say to that.

"event","I've decided that i would rather my journal to be <b>Friends-Only</b>. I don't mind people reading it, I would just rather not have random people reading it that I don't know about/not aware of. So, if you would like to be added to my friends list, simply <b>leave a comment</b> here, and I will most likely add you. I would very much appreciate if you would just say where you found me, and why you would like to be added. If I see that you just add people for the sole purpose of having a large friends list, I will not add you. Makes sense, yes? <b>Thanks</b>"

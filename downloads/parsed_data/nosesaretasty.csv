"event","I just spent ages filling in an application form to work at the St. Albans library (due in yesterday but ssh! it's the bank holiday. No-one should be working! :-P)

My mum accidentally deleted it all. It's not her fault. She didn't know that clicking the button would go to a different page and it wouldn't go back to the pervious page. Also, it's not her fault that the website didn't save it when I pressed the save button.

But it does mean I have to do it all again.

And it's taking AGES. And I can't be bothered. But I want this job!

"event","I haven't updated for <i>ages</i>. Well, I have. But nothing informative. Just random rants about stuff. Nothing about what I've actually <em>done</em>. So here goes.<br /><br /><u>August<br /><br /></u>First off - Results day. That was fun. We got there at 10:00 and got handed our piece of paper with results on. As you would expect at Results Day.<br />I got:<br />1 D (English Literature. Not too worried about that)<br />7 C's (My parents keep telling me I am qualitfied for Oceanology. 7 Cs - Seven Seas? Gettit?!?!?! Nah, tis a stupid joke. Anyway, they were in English Literature, Double Science, Food Tech, Music and&nbsp;drama)<br />1 B (Ohmigod, I got it in <em>French</em>! After sepnding 2 years telling my teacher I would fail miserably!!!)<br />An <em>A</em>!!! I GOT AN&nbsp;A!!! I<em>&nbsp;love</em>&nbsp;German!!!<br /><br />*coughs* Anyway, so Kez and I went into town to meet up with the STABS people (STABS Boys feels like tautology...). We stupidly went into the school... Made me feel ever so slightly not as clever as before... Anyway, we all went to... some restaurant that I'm sure someone will tell me the name of and... strangely enough... ate stuff. Oh yes, and Karen and Clare randomly appeared, too. <strike>And Kez disappeared, and other people arrived</strike> and I'm not entirely sure who was there...<br /><br />We then ended up going back to Anto's and watching V For Vendetta.<br /><br />A little while later (I.E. A Few days), my parents had a family party - nothing new, nothing different. Just... a party. For my mum's family only. My parent's <font color=""#808080"">silver</font> wedding anniversary party. I saw my mum's cousins and their kids and my mum's aunt and uncle and my grandparents etc. etc. etc. Nothing interesting happened, I just thought I'd mention it...<br /><br />Vicky took me to We Will Rock You. It was <em>amazing</em>. I've loved Queen for years, since I gave my brother a 3 disc Queen Greatest Hits CD for his birthday. I think I might have been about 12. Since then I've been <em>continuously</em> stealing them and listening to them and being obsessed with them. So... anyway, I <em>loved</em> WWRY. It's so hyper-making, and Galileo (the main character dude) was&nbsp;so cute, and Saramouche (the main character dudess) was so cool, and Killer Queen (The main baddy dudess) was funkiful, and Khashoggi (The 2nd in command baddy dude) was dudey!<br /><br />*coughs* Yeah...<br /><br /><u>September<br /><br /></u>Rach, my dearest darlingest Godsister, and I were made church members at the start of September. This was a nice experience, but kinda sad, because it was the last time Brian, our minister, would be church membering anyone...<br /><br />After that, we had the PS meet-up at Rachel's house. This was fun. I brought chocolate fudge cup-cakes, which looked <em>horrible</em>, but I'm told were very nice. It was nice to see people again (although I'd only just seen half of them about 2 weeks before :-P) because I had... things to hand out that I kept forgetting to give people. I very stupidly, however, forgot them, and literally <em>ran</em> home and back to grab them, so that I could be back before the last few people arrived (I didn't want to be last to arrive). Then ran back. Stupid, <em>stupid</em> me. There was no rush. But I eventually managed to hand out everything I'd been meaning to hand out (That story was <em>fated</em> to be forgotten. First I forgot to e-mail it home, then I forgot to take it to church (so I could photocopy it), then I forgot to take it to Rachel's so I could give it to Robbie, then Anto forgot he'd read it...). I was told there was no rush and that I didn't even have to go and get the stuff, but I'd spent nearly <em>all</em> night a few nights before doing that family tree for Robbie, and <em>refused</em> to <em>not</em> give it to him... *sighs* Silly Fi...<br /><br />I think it was in September that I stopped eating (Though it may have been before). It's not for any reason other than that I'm not hungry. But people don't seem to understand that. *glares*. And I don't eat when I'm not hungry *glares again* And <em>no</em> amount of poking will get me to eat (As some people *looks pointedly at Anto* will now know...)<br /><br />I started 6th form <strike>this</strike> last month. It started off really badly, but is now getting better.<br /><br />Also 6th-formy - in one of my free periods at the beginning of the term, I talked to SEN (Special Educational Needs) about possibly having very mild dyslexia. They said it's likey, and they're arranging for a computer test. But that is taking <em>forever</em>, so God-only-knows when I'll actually do it and get the results...<br /><br />Rachel, for her birthday, took us to the Phantom of the Opera. Only once before have I ever enjoyed being so depressed. It was <em>brilliant</em>. The costumes... the voices... ...wow. Though, not offense to anything or anyone or whatever I'm trying to say, I think I prefered We Will Rock You. But that's just personal preference. POTO was brilliant too!<br /><br />My parents had <em>another</em> <font color=""#808080"">silver</font> wedding anniversary party - this time for friends. I spend&nbsp;some of thie time playing schools with my 6 year old friend Sarah, then Rach's brother Dan came and joined in. We learnt to write our names (Or in Dan's case - Dannil) and she did the register. Then she had to leave and Dan and I spent the rest of the afternoon seeing who could eat the most fruit - he was eating all the pineapple, I was eating all the melon. ...I probably won.<br /><br />The next day, just as we were dashing out to church, my grandma phone. My mum's cousin Michael's wife Louise had had another little baby - a girl this time -called Susannah. Who sounds extremely cute and I can't wait to meet her.<br /><br />My ears got all messed up. The doctor said they had built up wax or something, so I had to have them irrigated. We arranged this for a Tuesday afternoon. Because it was in the middle of the town, I met up with Anto and Robbie (this was actually Robbie's idea) during their lunch break. Town was <em>wonderful</em>*. They <em>forced</em> me to chose a place to get lunch, <em>forced</em> me to chose what they were gonna force-feed me, then <em>forced</em> me to eat my (very nummy) lunch. *hmpfs* (Oh, and Todd and Paul randomly joined us... Twas all very nice and fun). I tried to steal Anto so he could take me to the doctor's (Techicanlly he volenteered. Because I was scared. I didn't know what was going to happen&nbsp;to me), but Todd wouldn't let me and they all kinda... stole me and dragged me down to their school. It was all very fun and insane. 5 of us, all linked arms, wandering down St. Peter's Street. *giggles* Ah, that was fun... Good memories...&nbsp;<br /><br />I needed to go to the library to get <em>a</em> book out. I was going to the doctor's - I knew it would be a long wait - so I decided to get <em>a</em> book out to read whilst waiting. That plan back-fired. I didn't get <em>a</em> book.<br /><br />...I got seven.<br /><br />Anyway, the doctor's-ear-thingy wasn't too bad, after all. It hurt a lot, but it was very effective, and I got a sticker!!! It's purple, it has a picture of a lion on, and says <em>Today at the Doctor's I was brave as a lion</em>. Of course, the first thing anyone said about it was some sort of comment about the Wizard of Oz...<br /><br />Brian, one of our <em>wonderful</em> ministers, and possibly one of my favourite grown-ups <em>ever</em> retired at the end of September. This was a very sad affair, and I will miss him. A lot.<br /><br /><u>October<br /><br /></u>This is is starting to worry my slightly. I'm <em>still</em> not eating properly...<br /><br />My parents had their third <font color=""#999999"">silver </font>wedding anniversary party. This time it was for my dad's family, which was nice, because I hadn't seen them for about five years... And since then, my cousin Matthew and his wife have had another kiddy. I spent the whole time talking to Laura (aged 10) about stuff and teaching her to play the piano, whilst Thomas (7ish), Chloe (My other cousin's daughter, aged 5) and Izzy (Aged 3) played Peter Pan in the garden... Cuteness...<br /><br />It was Vicky's birthday. Vicky's now my age again... Happy birthday her.<br /><br />I've recently worked out that I haven't been doing <em>any</em> work for <em>ages</em>, so I banned myself from MSN and forums so I can actually <em>do</em> something. GAH, I <em>hate</em> it. 2 and a half weeks without them!!! *cries* I'm going maaaaaaaaaaaad! And I haven't even been doing much work, either! No fair, I <em>hate</em> it!!!<br /><br />My handwriting has gone crazy. It's gone all curley and swirly and weird.&nbsp; my mum said something about handwriting matching a personality. Which I think is <em>stupid</em>, because mine is constantly changing. And she <em>chose</em> hers herself!<br /><br />I went to a party run by an Indian friend of my mum's, because he, too, has had another kiddy. Apparently on the same day as Louise had Susannah, which is freakeh! It was a <em>brilliant</em> party. There were only 9 white people there (including us), a mexican, a part mexican part German, part spanish girl (Daughter of said mexican and one of said white people) and everyone else was Indian. There was me, my parents, my bro and some of my mum's work colleuges. 2 of them were (relivately) normal, one was said half German, half Spanish person, and the other two were <em>PUNKS</em>! I spent all evening chatting to one of the punks (we're scarilly similar... Well our eating habits, anyway), and writing a story. Which was then translated into Spanish for the Mexican woman who <em>begged</em> me to let her read it. <br /><br />The food was <em>amazing</em>. Spicy, but tasty. And there was <em>loads</em> of it!!!<br /><br />Next week I'm being dragged off to my grandparents' house. Which means that rather than a two week ban, like I'd intended, it'll be a two and a half week. GAH!!! *dies*<br /><br />AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAnyway... That was <em>way</em> too long, I spent 2 periods doing this (That's 100 minutes... though I <em>was</em> trying to read the Wizard of Oz at the same time...)<br /><br /><font size=""1"">* This line was put in just for Vicky</font>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">I think you might like to know how my first week of this new experience (more commonly called 6th Form) is going. </span>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Most of it, though I hate to admit it, isn't going too badly. Bits of it are horrible, but I'll go into details a bit later.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">First off, what I'm enoying. Honest, there is some stuff!</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Italian. Italian is quite fun. The time just goes so *quickly* there are 3 of us now, but I'm still the only year 12. I don't mind this - it's fun, and makes me special! :-D We've doing really, really well - we've learnt to have a simple conversation, learnt to count to 20, and yesterday we started the alphabet! It's really fun, Miss Evans is really good and I love Miss Coulter's accent (She's Irish!!!) </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">ICT. The whole prospect of ICT is daunting - the mini-bus, the new school, the new people, the new account on the computer, the strange ways of said new school etc. But the actual lesson isn't too bad. We have 2 teachers, one that looks like Mrs Bates (Sorry Robbie, I know that means nothing to you) and one who annoys me, becuase I can't work out what accent she has. The Mrs Bates one teaches us Spreadsheets, the Accent one teaches us about the internet (yes, we need teaching). I sit next to the other person from Beaumont (Rikna) and someone called Lee, who is very nice and friendly. He helped me log onto my account during the 1st lesson (They have weird log-ins. 01elliottf - at Beaumont I'm p01felliott. I know this is off topic, but Robbie, what' s yours? I'm curious now...) Then today he got stuck and asked *me* for help! :-D So I was helping both him *and* Rikna (Who I have to explain *everything* to...) </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Leisure. leisure depends on who's teaching it. 1 have 3 teachers - Mrs Rigget-Jones, Mrs Fox and Miss Dunjerovich (Or however you spell it. She tells us to call her Miss D, so I will...) With Mrs RJ, we're just doing some project, with Mrs Fox... she just let us continue it, but with 'Miss D', we started learning about something else, which was *much* more interesting. </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">What I'm not enjoying *as* much. German. I have 3 teachers. The nice one, the boring one and the one-I-don't-know-the-name-of-because-she's-from-Verelum-but-is-also-boring. We have the Verelum teacher 1st thing on a Tuesday morning (What a way to wake us up!), Miss Edison (who's not been there for 2 lessons in a row) Thursday Mid (Ps 3+4) and Mrs Yapp (The boring one) Friday mid. Miss Edison's lessons are easily the most fun (then again, they always have been. And, of course, put against the others, it obviously is), because she's hardly ever there, so we just run riot (there not being a teacher to stop us). Today everyone was on their phones and on bluetooth, but that's a different story all together. At least I have a friend in German. She's a friend of Kerry's, but technically she's been my friend since we were babies. I know she came to something like my 5th birthday party... Anyway, we know each other, get on, and hav fun muckking around in German, whispering comments to each other, copying each other's work etc. </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Other stuff. Sandringham. I always get a feeling of forboding when I go there. That and hate. And depression. Today as I was walking in the gate from the mini-bus, I was practically in tears (again). The mood wasn't helped by the fact there was a huge grey cloud in the sky. Funny, I always thought they were metophorical. The lessons are all funny (they have 2 registrations! I got really worried that I'd gone to the wrong room and was almost ready to march to reception (of course, getting lost on the way... stupid school) when I remembered to check the planner, and they were still in registration!!!), they have weird computers/pupils and you have to be smart! On a Thursday I have to be smart of a SINGLE LESSON. Smart all day, just because I'm spending an hour at the stupid school!!! </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Mini-bus. The mini-bus isn't too bad. There are always people getting off when I am, yesterday the nice Verelum boy I was stuck next to stood up to let me out (very nice of him), and I normally get Psycho Bus Lady's mini-bus. This is ALWAYS fun - enough to cheer ANYONE up. I still get a giggle out of the psychoness of the driving and the calmness of the classical music she listens to... </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Ness. The whole idea of being BIG still scares me. 6th form have ALWAYS been bigger than me, taller than me (Rachel, you're excused. You're the same height), older than me, scarier than me (Yes, this includes you, Rachel dahling :-P) etc. And now I'M the big one (actually compared to our year 7s, I am!), I'M the scary one (some people might agree), I'M the old one (...Really, I'm not) etc. It's not... right! The German work is HARD. I used to be BRILLIANT at German (One reason I carried it on), now I'm... not very good... I don't understand the textbook, I don't understand the excercises in the text book etc. NOT GOOD! </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">On a slightly different note. I talked to SEN (Special Educational Needs), and someone got back to me, asking me about my options and who my English teacher was last year (?!). I don't think we decided on a time/date for the test - I'm expecting/hoping they'll get back to me. </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">My mother has just point out how horrible long this is - many apologies.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Thank you all your support. You have no idea how much it means to me.</span></p>"

We went to M &amp; Co and bought a new skirt (long, red, chord, with pretty red flowery patterns and sequins"") and a new t-shirt (Long sleeved, 3 types of red stripes, like my blue top, only it was red and didn't have anextra top underneath... and wasn't from Next), then we went to look at shoes/boots. There wasn't anything in the shop that fitted me... Then we went to the hardware shop and looked at wall paper for the hall. But didn't find anything. I saw a Magic Roundabout merangue! Then I don't remember what I did all afternoon. Then I did a jigsaw and went to bed (At 1 in the morning...)<br /><br />Today I went to church (as per usual), and it was fine... Sarah, my little 6 year old friend was normal, and <em>I GOT THE PICTURES OF MY FRIENDS ON IONA!!!</em> Life is good!!!<br /><br />Until 9 o'clock this evening, when <br />a. My brother returned from his camping thingy-ma-bob with ATC<br />b. The computer crashed/died/randomly restarted itself/made me want to kill it/went annoying/whatever<br />c. my mum lost her ebay auction (It was just a damn <em>cookery</em> <em>book</em>, mum! GET OVER IT!!!) and started yelling at the nearest person in sight (Namely <em>me</em>, who was deperately trying to bring up the ebay webpage so she could bid, even though the computer clock said it was 9:05.) Of course, this made me <em>extremely</em> cranky (...so what's new?)<br /><br />Last Monday, I went into London, with my dearest, dahlingest (and only) god-sister, wasted most of money on the Producers CD and some new headphones, then... promptly put the bag down and not being able to find it again later. Which I was rather upset about. But I <em>did</em> get some rather nice notebooks in the Disney Store (Which I now <em>love</em>).<br /><br />Since then, I have been on a picnic with several other people (Of which I can't be bothered to name, as it is 00:09 by my computer clock...) namely Rachel, Rach, Celia, Clare and Karen (Anto turning up later). If I've missed anyone out, it's got to the stage where I couldn't really care less... It's late and I'm only doing this to stop Alex poking me...<br /><br />Also (even better), I went into town with Rachel on Friday (?) and rebought the Producers sountrack!!! The <em>correct</em> version this time - last time I accidentally picked up the Original Cast (<em>Very</em> confusing, as they both have Nathan Lane and the cute, adorable Matthew Broderick on the front). Then yesterday, my parents came home from the Record Player shop and gave me a new pair of headphones!!!<br /><br />I get to feed Bob. Bob is Vicky's guinea-pig-that-my-dad-keeps-calling-a-gerbil. I also get to feed the hedgehogs that have set up residency in Vicky's back garden!!! YAY!<br /><br /><em>Also</em>, I have a nice and busy time in the next two weeks. On Wednesday I get to go to work with my father at the Royal Air Force Museum London (http://www.rafmuseum.org/london/index.cfm). On Thursday, of course, it is Results Day (Which I suddenly started dreading at 9 o'clock this morning because of a dream I had last night... Bloody nightmare.), On Friday I have a tea-time date with someone from my church - she's taking me out for food to interview me for the church magazine.<br /><br />On the Monday after, it's my parent's 25th Wedding Anniversary party. I have nothing to wear. Anyway, I'm only mentioning this, because they're having another one on the 16th September. And one in October. Why do we need 3 parties, damn it?! ...But that's not the point. <br /><br />On the Tuesday I'm going into town with my mother to buy shoes and boots for school (I <em>love</em> Footsteps. I have fucked up feet, and Footsteps is the only shop to be able to cope... mainly because we've been going there since... forever...) After than, I am (hopefully) going to meet up with Rachel (I haven't discussed this with her yet) and go to Blockbuster and the Library to get DVDs to watch on our sleepover. Because we are having a sleepover from Tuesday to Wednesday, where we will watch lots and lots of films that neither of us have seen. (Top on the list is Nanny McPhee, because Fi is a self obsessed, helpless Colin Firth obsessive. 2nd on the list is Pride and Predjudice because Fi is a self obsessed, helpless Keira Knightley and Talluah Riley (She was in a random Miss Marple TV programme and she RULED) fan.)<br /><br />On the Thursday I get to see We Will Rock You with Vicky as part of the West End's <em>Kid's Week</em> - <em>I CAN'T WAIT</em>!!! I read the script when Vicky lent it to me, and I'm obsessed with Queen, so I'm really, really doubly (???) excited!!!<br /><br />A week on Sunday, Rach and I become church members. This will be a sad occasion, as it will be the last time our minister ever makes anyone a church member ever again, because he is retiring at the end of September. I shall wear my new 6th form clothes (so anyone reading this will know what they look like and how bad my descriptions are...) Afterwards, it's the PS meet-up - woohoo!!! I shall attempt to make Chocolate Fudge Cupcakes, because it's damn easier to share than a giant cake...<br /><br />I'm going to leave now because<br />a. All this talk of cake is making me hungry...<br />b. I want to go to bed (It's nearly 1in the morning, damn it - that's late for me!)<br /><br />Byeee!!! And I hope you're happy now, Alex! BYE!!!"

"event","3:15!!! 13:26!!! I am going to <i>kill</i> Alex!!!

He wouldn't let me go to bed until 3:15 in the morning! Because of that, I went back to sleep after my mum pulled my duvet off.

13:26, I woke up. HALF PAST ONE IN THE AFTERNOON. I have <i>never</i> slept in that long. It would have been even longer if Vicky hadn't phoned. 

In other news:

I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean yesterday. I did not melt as much as Vicky claims I did, but when he first spoke, and you couldn't see who it was - you could just hear his voice, I was a little sticky puddle on the floor...

After that I wasn't quite so bad (but that might just be becasue I kept not recognising him. There's something about a beard and brown hair that makes him unrecognisable. Maybe it's just because I'm used to him clean shaven and with a grey wig on...)

I've said it before, and damn, I'll say it again if I have to - Jack Davenport has such an <i>amazing</i> voice...

*coughs* But let's not <i>just</i> talk about that...

The rest of it was quite good. In enjoyed it, but I found some scenes more boring that others. The ones with Jack was definitely better than the Will ones, but not just because I hate Orlando Bloom.

The bit where you first <s>see</s> meet Norrington is amazing. (Damn... it's got back to him again...) He has his back to you and it mainly in shadow, so you only know it's him if you recognise the voice. It really reminded me of the part in V For Vendetta when Evey's just been tortured and V comes and stands in the doorway and Rachel goes *Squee!!!*

Of course, I do recognise the voice of Norrington, because I had that story tape, so my first reaction was *melts*. My second reaction was *squee* my third reaction was ""Yay it's Norrington!!! :-D

... I'm not obsessive over him at all!!!

And to prove it, I shall talk about something else: Stormbreaker.

I have had a very nice 2 days - I spent them both at the cinema with Vicky. On Wednesday we went to see Stormbreaker.

I was in hysterics the whole way through. This does not make it a bad movie. it was just <i>funny</i>. Except, of course, when Ewan McGregor died... Then I nearly cried, because Alex Rider was looking all upset, standing in the hall, lit up by police sirens (that doesn't make sense, does it? The blue flashey ones you get when there's sirens...) and it's all silent excpet for the requiem music over the top... That and I love Ewan McGregor.

But the rest of it was funny. Like Bill Nighy trying to do no emotion, or Alex Rider beating people up with a piece of rope.

The scariest thing is, by the end of the film, I was just going ""Oh kill Alex Rider! Let him fall to his death!"" That is not me. I <i>love</i> Alex Rider. <S>He's another person/character I want to rape...</S> But I'll explain about raping people some other time, as I'm being poked into coming off and getting dressed..."

I hate 6th form and I hate Sandringham. I'm sitting on front of a computer that won't log me on, after getting lost about 10 times, waiting for a teacher, although the lesson was supposed to start 10 minutes ago. Some idiot is making the conmputer make weird noises with his phone, and my phone ran out of battery before it could send my rant-text to Anto. And not <i>other</i> idiots are fiddling with the heating.
Life. SUCKS.
I had a boring lecture from the world's most boring German teacher, Mrs Yapp, then had to talk to 6th formers about 6th form (which I cuold talk to Rachel about any time I like. In fact, I do so frequantly), but it was Kat, so it wasn't too bad.
Then I had to catch the minibus to Sandringham by myself (Sarah Deacon looked after me, though), then I had to find the right room. Sid* was actually really nice and told me where G block was, but the huts were only G5/G6, so I stopped a random teachre, who directed me (""It's right in front of you, dear."")
There is obviously no teacher coming, as we've had 3/4 of a lesson already and nothing's happened except a few prank calls. This school sucks! YOu can't find anywhere - everything's hidden down steps and round corners. I can't wait to get away and back to Beaumont - preferably home, actually.
I'm gonna go home, (cry), find some money and then beg Rachel to let me come into town - this day's been so f*cking crap, going into town will be really good. Oh yes, and charge my phone up.
Way Hay! I get to leave early! Beaumont, here I come, I love you!

~

OK, the ride home cheered me up slightly. I only had to wait about 5 minutes before the bus arrived, at which point the randon guy held the door open for me. We had Crazy Bus Lady, who was playing Jupiter (My favourite from the Planets suit), and then when we got to Beaumont (Just me for Beaumont! Everyone else for Veralum), then same (I think) guy opened the door for me - saving me the embarrassment of being too weak and having to struggle with it! (<i>Someone</I> called 'next time... walk!' at me, but he was probably joking... I hope! Anyway, as the door shut, I heard one of the girls say 'Don't be so mean!') Also, I miss assembly! Mr DeKort said it's just talking about extra curricular activities (Jobs), but I don't mind. The only thing you actually sign up for today is Drama or Sport, neither of which I'm fussed about, so that's OK.

~

Well, I talked to Robbie (Big woo hoo... not), but that didn't do anything. If anything, it made it worse. Talking to Alex made it worse, coz he kept giving me stupid little messages to pass to Robbie. In the end I flipped and started yelling at Alex rather than Robbie. What made it even worse is the fact Alex was so <i>nice</i> about it! So horribly understanding. It <i>really</i> made me feel bad. All he did was calmly say: ""Do you want to talk about it?""
Town was <i>wonderful</i>! For the 1st time today I was actually <i>happy</i>. Even whilst drying Anto's chair with tissues stolen from Costa Coffe I was happy. It was fun! And my smoothie was nice - Apple Pie! We chatted for about an hour and it was <i>wonderful</i>. Brilliant. When we got on the bus, we'd just said 'bye' to Anto, but it turned out the bus wasn't going the way we wanted, so pretty soon we were back off. Anto hadn't reached the end of the road at that point and, as a joke, I called 'Anto! Come back!' I hadn't meant him to hear it, but hear he did and came back! I couldn't stopped laughing!
After tea I tidied my room then went on Medaesylae/PS/PSR/MSN, not forgetting to check the time of Milton Jones. I had a nice chat with Alex, mostly about Mal-Fait and Kat at Kat's wedding.
It was when mum got home that everything started. She decided we had NO time to do ANYTHING apart from tidy. I just wanted to talk to Alex - I <i>like</i> Alex! In the end she told me I was coming off at half past. Yes, of course. At 22:30, Milton Jones was on! I shouldn't have said anything. I was forced to come off - she pulled the modem cord out of the modem, restarting the computer. This, as usual, started an arguement.
I decided everyone was blaming everything on me, though dad says otherwise. We had a nice talk, which always makes me feel better.
My dad, like me, belioeves I have self-confidence problems. This, actually, is a <i>huge</i> relief. It may not sound like anything good, but I was beginning to wonder is anyone had noticed. But tonight, we were <i>all</i> in bad moods, and dad was gradually calming me down and stopping me crying by telling me 6th form will be OK by the end of the 1st week and my bro just muttered ""<i>If</i> she gets in."" My dad didn't hear, but I did and shouted ""SHUT UP!"" then had to explain to my dad, who went ""Stop it, Philip! Your sister has enough self-confidence problems as it is!"" Ah, nice to be loved by <i>one</i> member of your immediate family...
Mum thinks I might have slight dyslexia, because I have really bad spelling. I have another reason. My eyes jumble up letters. For ages, I've been reading the name 'Shelagh' as 'Shagleah' and yesterday Alex told me something was 'diluted', I read it as 'dulited' and spent <i>ages</i> trying to work out what it meant!
Now it's 12:18 by my alarm clock, 12:17 by my mobile clock, 12:18 by my watch, plus I'm writing by mobile-light, so I'd better go...

"event","I was lying on my bed, listening to the tape of Jack Davenport (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202603/ - Commodore Norrington) reading The Supernaturalist by Eoin Colfer that I got out the library, trying not to fall asleep (he has a hypontising voice), <s>meditating</s>, putting off my maths revision etc, when my dad came in. He sat on the bed, listening for a minute, then said.
""Who's reading?"" I paused for a moment, thinking that if I just blurted out the name, my dad might a. not know who he is, and b. think it's a little obsessive, then said cautiously:
""Jack Davenport."" Dad thought about this for a second, then said:
""Is he the guy from Coupling?"" I was surprised, I hadn't realised he'd heard of him.
""I don't know,"" I admitted. ""But he's in Pirates of the Caribbean.""
""Oh really?"" Dad said. ""I didn't know that."" I got off the bed and checked the back of the tape box. Dad was right - Jack Davenport was in Coupling! 

That was a boring story. Now, if anyone's still awake... Here is a slightly more interesting story about the dangers of tomatos:

""Tomatoes are NICE! Though they splurge everywhere when you bite them, then you have to go round the whole day with tomato pips and juice on your top and look like a total prat, and everyone points at you and laughs and says ""Ha ha! They like tomatos."" And you say ""YES! I like tomatos!"" And they look at you, shrug and say ""fair enough"" and walk off.

or not...""

"event","Sunday/Monday was cool. I went to the IMAX cinema in London with a few (*coughs*) friends - Rachel, Rachel, Anto*, Phoebe*, Clare, Todd, Joe, Robbie, Leanne and Karen to see V For Vendetta.

It. <I>Ruled</I>.

(Although I'm never allowed a sleepover again.)

I cried. I cry a lot at films, it's not a new thing, but I didn't cry last time I saw it...

Anyway, I was sandwitched in between Rachel and Rachel (hey, I never realised that before...). Normally when I cry on films I put my head on the shoulder of the person nearest. This happened to be Rachel (M). So, with my (left) thumb in my mouth, I leant my head right... and hit @nto**'s hand.

Miffed, I tried again. I got Anto's hand again. <i>Damnit</i>. I'd forgotten @nto puts his around Rachel...

Not caring about anything anymore (I was upset, damnit!) I put my head on Anto's arm, then held onto his hand (with my right hand), whilst still sucking my (left) thumb.

Anyway, we got back to St. Albans at 00.07, and all went to @nto's for a sleepover. I slept for about 10 minutes, sorta, but then woke up and couldn't get back to sleep. As it was dark, and I had no glasses on, when I saw Rachel and Anto hugging, it was totally and utterly <i>adorable</i> as they were, really, two greyish blobs... So cute! I couldn't stop grinning. In the end I joined them sitting on the floor. They both leant against me and I felt very motherish... ***

Yeah, Rachel and I talked all night****, then we had breakfast, doughnuts and flapjack and we went home.

* I don't know how you do the little clicky thingy where there's a link and you clock on it and it goes to their LJ, so I didn't...
** Anto/@nto, I never know what to call you, so I alternated. Is that OK? :P
*** I really enjoyed feeling motherish... (Or should it be 'motherly'?) I can't decide if it's a good thing or not... 
**** I've missed a hell of a lot of stuff out,  but I have to go eat tea now...
***** The mood-picture-thingy isn't the right one for 'Loved', but the picture for 'Loved' isn't the one I wanted, so I combined the two..."

Gavin is REALLY COOL! He's really goth (black clothes, really cool big boots with buckles on, black hair) and, normally quiet, but he was more of a normal person then...

Alice dragged me away, my brother, David and Marcus played some form of Pokemon board game, and Steven did god-knows-what. Alice proceeded to hit and punch and kick me until it was lunchtime.

After lunch, Alice want to beat me up again, so tried to drag me (literally!) upstairs, but Gavin caught her and told her off (!) the parents Colin, my brother, Steven and I then walked the dog. When we got back, Alice attempted to tickle me. I attempted to stop her. In the end, Gavin just grabbed her, picked her up and carried her out the room. She ran back in and attempted to tickle me again (oh yes, I forgot to mention: I apparently enjoyed this - no-one told me!) Gavin caught her and carried her out again. This went for about half an hour. In the end, as tea was ready Gavin literally threw her out the room. 5 minutes later, at tea, Alice announced that Gavin had hurt her because ""He was sticking up for his girlfriend, Fiona."" 

This prompted everyone teasing - not me (thank god!) but Alice - 
""Where's your boyfriend, David?"" Steven asked.
""SHUT UP!"" Alice screamed. David insisted on sitting next to me. ""Gavin, your girlfriend is cheating on you!"" ""Alice, your boyfriend is cheating on you!"")

After tea, Gavin, Steven and I sat in Steven's room and Gavin drew a picture pour moi (!) while Steven showed me some of his drawings - I felt so love!

Gavin scribbled his e-mail address on a piece of paper, and David and I argued over it. In the end, I won and David got the e-mail address written on a bottle... Gavin's weird like that...

Oh yeah, and David kissed me when we left...

But y'see I feel like Joly does in Les Mis. And I also sound like him sometimes. But that's only part of the reason.

Also, he has very sweet lines like:
""Courfeyrac you bust take un umbrella or you will get a cold."" or
""I think Barius - Marius - is head over heels in love."" ... or something like that. God forgive me if it is wrong.

My OTHER explanation is my name (which I have just realised I haven't explained) The freaks that go round with me - sorry, my FRIENDS, should know this, but all you bored viewers - sorry, all you lovely interested visitors... RUN AWAY! ESCAPE WHILST YOU CAN! No, that's not what I was gonna say... Start again. All you people who don't know me, you won't understand. 

Y'know when you hold your thumb in between your index finger and your middle finger to make it look like you've got someone's nose? I used to (when I got this LJ) do that to my friend. Then I'd pretend to eat my thumb, thus eating her 'nose'. And it tasted good! Thus, I have a name! nosesaretasty!"

"event","I've been out today. I was out at Potter's Bar all afternoon, filming a TV show called 'Rock around the block'. Two families did a dance to a 'pop' song and we had to judge which was best. We got into the hall quite early so we went straight to the front (well... second line) and WE GOT FILMED!!! Granted, we were just jumping around and screaming, but WE GOT FILMED!!! WE COULD BE ON TV!!!

THEN, after voting, we got RIGHT to the front, and we got an interview. We said it IN SINC and we will <i>probably</i> be ON TV!!!

Woo!!! GO US!!!

Excuse me whilst I go and gloat over my brother.

"event","I am boiling. So much for british summer! I got home from Germany technically 2 days, but I didn't get to sleep after we got back until about half past mid-night the next day. So I was expecting it to be cold, as it usually is in England, but NO.  Of COARSE not. Why would it be? Just because I got back from boiling hot GERMANY, it's boiling hot in the one place that's famous for being FREEZING in summer! *Mutters angrily* 

I'm going to the cinema tomorow with my little godsister. We're gonna spend a day there. In the morning we're watching... Shrek, I think, then in the afternoon, King Arthur. The UCI have taken Harry Potter out of the cinemas in the 2 weeks in which we had to plan this trip, go away and come back AND do more arrangements, so we're seeing King Arthur instead. *Mutters and grumbles*

I bought the Harry Potter 3 soundtrack in Germany, then had a massive arguement with my brother about who was going to use MY CD played first. I won by snatching the CD player out of the car door before he could grab it. So what if it wasn't sharing? I'd been sharing it for 2 days, in which he'd listened to a CD in it and I HADN'T. It was the first time in the whole week that I'd listened to my own CD played, because I'd forgotten to pack the CD case full of (mainly my brother's) CDs. *Stops ranting*

I watched Holes yesterday and the whole of The Black Adder today (Both with my little godsister) and tomorrow we're going to the cinema, so I'm having a very 'movie' week. Fun. I also wrote more of my Mary-Sue story today, bringing it onto page 67. Well, I call it a Mary-Sue, but it's more or a self-insertion. I also read most of the 7th Book in the series of infortunat events seires. I hate them, but I read them anyway. Dunno why. *Reads books*

My little godsister is always begging me to go on http://www.dreamstars.net/boards (Her website), but I really can't be bothered, but she will only come on LJ if I go on that, and it's really annoying. I'm not *doing* anything on there, though. Hopefully she'll get bored of it like she did with her old one. That really upset me, because I love that board and I AM THE PERSON WITH THE MOST POSTS! *Is proud*"

"event","I went to see Harry Potter (again) yesterday this time with Vicky. It was fun. We talked all the way through it, even though Vicky hadn't seen it before (We both the the book off by heart anyway!) 

The most embarrasing part was when Ron, quite clearly said ""There's a wonky cross, which means you're going to suffer, but what looks like a sun, which mean you're going be happy about that. Sorry about that."" the professer Trilawny grabbs the cup, and you look inside it, and you see the grim in the tea leaves. Nothing else, and I said, very loudly, and very clearly

""What happened to the wonky cross?"".

Sorry if you haven't seen the film, but just remember - 
* Lupin does NOT go soppy over Lily Evans in the BOOK
* Lupin does NOT have a really stupid, ANNOYING mastauche in the BOOK (I don't think).
* Hermione DOES NOT care what her hair looks like in the BOOK.
* Harry persuading Lupin to teach him how to do a patronus is in Lupin's CLASSROOM in the BOOK.
* Ron's leg got BROKEN by Sirius, rather than just bitten

erm... there's more, but if I say, then I'll tell you ALL about it (I fyou haven't read the books)."

Erm... a bit of free publicity: http://s8.invisionfree.com/Island_of_Dreams/index.php? - an RP forum. You can only talk in story form. Apart from the out of character section. It's about a school for magic. It's fun.

http://s7.invisionfree.com/Insanity_Fair - a random forum (not RP) just as fun. if you join, please PM 'Kibeth' and tell her that 'Fi recommended it' or something like that.

Going back to the subject of birthdays, I got an 'e-present' from my friend today, and a birthday present and card from another friend yesterday. I've been forbidden to open the one from Rachel (non-e-present one). I don't even know where my mother has hidden it. The e-present is that picture up there *points to picture thingy*"

Oh god! I've just remembered! On Thursday I think it was... I'll give you the whole story.

Ages ago, Vicky's sister asked me to do something on 'Why I like Lord of the Rings'. I told the truth about it.  

On Wednesday, it was published in a random magazine in the school library. I've been having people quoting it at me (I usually like quotes, but this is just annoying), and 'agreeing' with the stupidest things, that aren't even true of me any more. It's not fair!"

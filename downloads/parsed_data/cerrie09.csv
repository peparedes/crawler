"event","wow--a lot of stuff has happened ever since i've written. well, i'll touch the major points. toward the end of june, there was a last tuesday concert in warren, allura told me about it, so i went. i took tammy and jamie with me, it was a good time. on the fourth of July i had an AWESOME time! first i went to the parade with Jamie-and i saw a BUNCH of time friends there, like, almost all of my Warren friends-it was good. then that night i went to the fireworks with Tammy and we met up with Jamie later on. it was great. nothing really happened until the end of July-Sherry left for Texas. it sucked-seriously. then fair week came-oh my gosh that was a BLAST!! every day i ended up hanging out with Kasi then almost every day i would end up hanging out with a guy. lol. but it was all good. well, the last night i was kinda ticked off becuz a bunch of my ""friends"" said that they would love to hang out with me and when they had the chance-they acted like they didn't want to, oh well. the band camp came, blah, then exhibition. after exhibition my friends had a party so, i went up to that. school started. then i got a boyfriend. he's a senior. but, a week and a half later, he broke up with me. he ""couldn't keep his priorites straight with a girlfriend""-oh well. homecoming was last weekend. oh my gosh, it was AWESOME!! i loved it!! the dance ROCKED!! but, i better get goin."

We watched Back to the Future and ate pizza. then i left there and went to graduation. we had to have graduation inside-man it was hot in there!! but then after graduation i stood around with Sara-i always have a good time with that gurl. then after that Britney picked me up and took me out to Ashley's house. Man, we had SOO much fun!! it was our Great Group of Six-Danni, Ashley Wilcox, Ashley Wilson, Cassie, Amber, and Ashley Wilson. we pitched a tent so we could sleep outside-well, we tried to anywayz! then Ashley's dad came home and redid it. we went swimming at like 10 at night. we were all really hyper. then we went up and played DDR. then after that Ashley's mom made us a fire and we made smores. then we went to the tent and stayed up and talked and took picutres. Ashley's digital camera can take pictures when it's pitch dark out and it'll look like it's day. we had a wondeful ""Circle"" time where we asked questions and all of us answered them. then we got up in the mornin at like 8. we all got breakfast and Cassie left. then Ashley M. and W. left. then the 3 of us went swimming. then we played some more DDR. then Amber left and me and Ashley got some lunch. then we watched Taxi-then my dad came and got me. it was like 2 by then. then he took me home and then we went over to his friend Andy's house and we went swimming. then we came back home and i washed my hair then we went out to dinner. then after that we went out to Spring Creek and my dad golfed while i drove the golf cart. then we came home and i played DDR cuz Ashley is lettin me borrow it. i had a great weekend. i seriously did. today i might be goin up to the pool-it all matter on whether Jamie goes up.

"event","man, today was my last full day of being an ""ankle biter"" or ""midget"" as the seniors would say-lol. it went by SOOOO fast it wasn't even funny. but, i had a BLAST with me and my friends. man, we had SO much fun. well, Cassie brought in her digital camera and got a BUNCH of picutres of me-lol. she should be sending them to me soon. but anywayz, i just talked to my friends all day-that's all we did. Cassie got a good pic of me and Jayda being really hyper-it's funny. i convinced Mr. Reynolds to take our class out to the courtyard. lol. me and Jayda were daning around and acting like complete idiots-oh well, like my saying ""it's better to look like an idiot with someone else rather than look like an idiot by yourself"". i am going to school tomorrow, i just don't wanna go to bed quite yet. i really don't know why though. oh well. i'm just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO glad that school is over. Tomorrow after graduation i'm heading up to Ashley Wilcox's house. it's gonna be me, Ashley M., Ashley Wilson, Amber and Cassie all up at Ashley Wilcox's house. it's really confusing when you have 3 people with the same name in the same place-lol. well, i guess i got used to it after sitting with them at lunch. we got a good pic of Ashley, we had to like HOLD her down to get the one picutre of her-it's funny. i can't wait to see it. i'm holding her one arm in the pic. i had a good last full day of school-i really did. oh, and me and my lil cuz Zach had fun during computer messing with the photo editor on the comps doin stuff to the picutres that i had saved on my account. like, i had the pic of me and Andrew on there, and he like smugged his face-it was funny. but, i better get goin. PEACE OUT AND ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~^*Danni Elise"

"event","well, today was cheerleading try-outs. man, it was CRAZY! i did my best! well, i wast he 2nd to last person to go! well, then they came out of the gym and posted it. i saw my name...but it was under ""Alternate"". well, i beat all the other 8th graders who tried out and a few other girls. I'm the first and only alternate the Holly (the coach) chose to take. so, i'm just hoping someone quits. OR, if someone gets hurt, i take their place, but i really don't want that to happen. Amber said she would quit so that i could take her place, but i told her no. She didn't even wanna try out for basketball, its just the fact that Holly said that she would need her next year. like i said, i REALLY hope that someone quits, i really do. 2 MORE DAYS!!!!!!!!!"

Well, today and tomorrow are just the practices. and then Thursday is the offical try outs. Then, today, after cheerleading, i have a National Honor Society thingy mo-bober to go to. man, i'm so busy this week. me and Tammy went up to Wal Mart to get our pictures developed yesterday. then i came home and scanned a bunch of pictures-17 total-and i saved them on the computer. if you want any sent to you, just tell me and i will!! but yeah, i better be heading out, PEACE OUT! ~^*Danielle Elise"

"event","Well, it's Sunday. I just got outta the shower. On Friday, after school, me and Jayda went over to the Galley while Morgan had track practice and Kasi went over to the middle school. Me and Jay waited for Kasi at the Galley. I ordered 2 pizza balls and they got one pizza ball each. Then we went over to the high school. We sat there with Morgan cuz her practice was optional so, we were allowed to be there. Then they had the elementary track meet. man, those little kids are SOOO cute!! me, Kasi, and Jayda helped with the consession stand, even though we didn't have to, we had nothin else to do, other than watch all the little kids. After the track meet we went over to TJs and got The Ring, Ghost Ship, Coyote Ugly, Barber Shop, and crap..i don't remember the other movie that we got-oh well, it ain't that important. Then Kasi's dad picked us up at Quality and we went out to her house. We watched The Ring, Coyote Ugly, and the movie that i can't remember what its name is! Then we watched a bunch of home movies that Kasi and a bunch of other people made. We didn't go to bed until like 4.

Yesterday we didn't get up until 11. We got up and thought about what we could do for a home video of our own. So, we made a home video, man, i had fun makin it!! i haven't seen it yet-Kasi's makin me a copy of it. She said it was funny. Then Jayda's mom came and picked us up. Then around 6:30 Jill picked me up and we went to Otterbien for a youth ralley thingy. I thought it was really kewl. The guys that did it from Teen Challenge were really kewl!! Then we came home.

I had a busy weekend. It was good though. I really needed to get outta the house though. Only 6 more days until i leave!!!!!!"

<P>Here's a picture from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire-coming out November 18, 2005!! I SOOOO can't wait!! Even though the wonderful trio looks really sad-Rupert Grint (Ron)&nbsp;looks REALLY hott! When i'm gonna be watching the movie, i'm probably gonna be sittin there practically drooling! lol!</P>
<P>Anywayayz, just sittin here in English class watching music videos with Eric on his computer. He's gonna be gone all next week. I'm not gonna have anyone to talk to when we're in the computer lab for english! i love updating during school. i dunno why-it gives me sumthin to do, i guess.</P>
<P>Hm..too much crap going on. i seriously can't wait to go to the OBX-only 15 more days! Goin to the boy's baseball game after school today, cuz i have nothing else better to do. I'm going with Tammy cuz if i go with Jayda she's gonna be with Andy and i'll feel like a flippin' third wheel-and i HATE that!</P>
<P>intersting day up at the LEC yesterday. oh man, Andrew didn't go-don't ask me why.&nbsp;Adam wasn't there cuz&nbsp;Andrew wasn't.&nbsp;Oh well. but, in our digital video class we needed them to do sum stuff for our movie. But we only have 3 more weeks of goin up there. We have an awesome time on the bus on the way there. on my goodness. Ashley, Amber, Kasi, Brenton, Zach, and I have a BLAST! i think we have more fun on the way there than the rest of the day! it's great! but like Amber will SLAM her face up to the back window when we stop if there is a car behind us. oh my, my eyes almost started watering i was laughin so hard.</P>"

Everyone here is trying their best to cheer me up. It works for about 5 minutes, then i just go back to being sad. It's hard not to think about everything that happened yesterday. Everything has just sucked after school yesterday to right now. All of my friends keep trying to make me laugh and smile and they tell me that they love me. It really helps to know that they love me. Last night Jason was the main person that got me through the night. He kept tellin me a lot of comforting stuff. He's a great friend! I love ya Jason! But, really not much has happened today. Let's see-went to home ec, math test, got a book from the library for notetaking, almost fell asleep in lunch, finished my test for science, watched Anne Frank in english, played in band, quiz in social studies, then doing cartoons in computer."

"event","Great time at the Famine, really! On Friday at noon the famine started and we had to be at the Joy Hall. We had to get signed in and give Jill everything and all that good stuff. Then we did a game and went out and did a food drive. Then when we were done we went over to the EUM church. then we went back over to the Joy Hall, got our stuff, and then headed out for Corry. Then we got to the Salvation Army. They had a bowling alley and everything! it was really kewl! we did a lot of things. discussions, devotions, games, we got free time, juice breaks, all that good stuff. I got to play PS2 on a projection screen-oh man it was kewl! and at the end of the night we watched Incredicbles and then everyone went to bed.

Today was REALLY tiring. Joe Reed kept bring up food and it was makin me mad cuz i didn't wanna think about eating. i was still kinda sick and when you don't eat when you're sick-you're REALLY tired!!!anyways, today-when we were supposed to leave the Salvation Army to go back to the Joy Hall to break our fast, we got in the big 15 passenger van and all the other vehicles left-and the van wouldn't start!!!!!!!!!!! it was like 4:45 when everyone else left. so, after like 20 minutes passed, Mr. Hoover walked to go find a pay phone. He came back around 5:30 and he told us his wife was coming to get us. She got there around 6 and we didn't get to the Joy Hall until 6:30 and man were we hungry!!! so we ate and did all that good stuff and i came home!!"

And then Amber Gilson standing 5 feet away from us saying ""HA! I told you not to drink too much!!"" lol! oh my, me and my friends seriously have some good memories together!! geez, don't get any bad ideas about Ashley before ya get to know her though!!!"

Cuz Jamie's mommy can't pick us up from youth group tonight so, we're not going. :( this sucks majorly man!! then again, something might pop up that some one will give me a ride, who knows!! Hopefully that's what happens! If not, it will give me a night to catch up with homework. But seriously, I really wanna see Andrew! I really wanna live in Warren but, like i tell everyone, i really can't see myself living anywhere but Youngsville until i graduate! Until then, i'm stuck here. Zack says he hates Warren, i told him i would love to trade him places! Youngsville is just too boring for me sumtimes. When you can't drive or go anywhere, it's really boring here. Cuz the only thing you CAN do is walk around town(kiley-with our wonderful heart-to-heart walks!). I can't wait until my Junior year! Seriously...A LOT is happening to me that year. Me and my friends getting our lisences, me getting my Junior jacket, me going to Ireland...it goes on and on!"

"event","well, still sick, stuck at school. oh well, only a half hour to go! A lot on my mind i didn't get to say this morning. Well, my friend from Warren, Zack, really has been ticking me off! He keeps lying about stupid crap that he really has no point in saying. That's like a MAJOR thing i hate-lyers! they make me mad! it's just like, dude, why can't you just tell the freakin truth? AHH!! Just too many things bothering me lately. I guess it's the little things that i don't confront and then they just start to add up and...all the frustration is coming out now. It's just crazy. Well, Bill Bunce is home from the Marines. I don't know when he came home, when he's leaving...all i know is that he is home for 10 days and then when he leaves, he's being based in South Carolina. That's a good thing. On Saturday, i was on the computer at home, and i hear someone come in the front door, it was Sam Huff. Then i went to give her a hug, then i look and THERE'S BILL! My jaw DROPPED! I didn't know he was comin home, geez, why can't people inform me on these things??!! But, that was like the highlight of my weekend. Only 29 more days of school left!! YEAH, ROCK ON!!! I can't wait till summer. Just no stress, no worries...none of that crap!! This summer-all that i have is...going up to the pool, YAC, going up to the pool some more, then camp li-lo-li (maybe), fair, band camp. i can't wait!! besides the band camp part!!! lol!! oh yeah, Miss Welsh's class fishy Woody died...i really don't care!! Jamie was happy about it...why, i wish i knew!! But as far as i know, me and Jamie are going up to youth group tomorrow-really can't wait!!!<3"

It's a waste of my time! i wish i had a study hall. but, with my shedule and everything, i won't have one until my Sophmore year. ANYWAYZ, my friend from Warren likes Jamie. They just met last Tuesday at youth group. It's crazy! But, who knows whats gonna happen between them. But, Jamie got me sick!! i SHOULD be staying home from school but, with tomorrow being Tuesday and i barely have enough time to do my homework for that day, it would be worse if i had to do today's work also."

Then at 11:30 Tammy came to my house and her dad took us up to Bilo to do tag days for band. we worked from 12-3. i was counting down the minutes until 3 came!....finally 3 o' clock came and Andrew and his step mom came and picked me up. Then we went and picked up Adam then went to Andrew's house. We went outside and played on his trampoline-it was fun!! then we went inside and watched tv for a lil while. then we had a lil dinner-peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. Then we left his house and went and picked up Adam and Andrew's friend Alissa (i think thats how ya spell it). then we headed up for Stateline!! The races were A LOT of fun!!! i was sitting there, eating my fries, and i hear ""there she is!""-i look up and its Jayda and her mom Connie. i jumped up and gave Jayda a hug-Andrew had NO clue who it was and he looked at me like i had lost it. so, we hung out with the 5 of us. man, i had A LOT of fun! it was great!! i hope that i get to go with Andrew next time he goes up there!!"

"event","last night-went up to Warren for youth group!!! oh my, i had a kinda down day cuz i really had nothing to look forward to, except jazz band, cuz i didn't know i was going to youth group. Well, i got home from jazz at 5:40. I walk in the front door, grab the phone, look to see if Andrew called me, he did, so, i called him back. He was at Perkins (great place, right Niki?), in the middle of getting his food ordered, and i asked him why he called. He was like ""well-my step-mom was in Youngsville and she was gonna pick you up and bring you here, but you weren't home."" well, we got off the phone after saying good-bye, and then he calls me 3 minutes later and says ""do you have a ride up to Warren? my dad said he would take you home."" i SPRINT to my living room and jump on the couch and ask my dad if he can give me a ride, and obviously he did. so, i made dinner, ate, got outta there, went to youth group. the service was great, like it was last week. after the service, we sat on the stairs in the church then decided to go outside. we were standing outside and we decided to play hide and seek. Andrew GRABS my arm and pulls me and starts running and we went and hid. it wasn't a GREAT hiding place but, it was the only one we could find at the time! then somehow all of us ended up on South Street and we went to south street school and played on the playground. it was fun. Andrew. Amanda, and Allura (i think that's all who it was) were having fun going down memory lane walking around the school, i kinda felt left out, obviously. Lacey and Tony, were on the playground still at the time. Zac was with us, i kept going in and out of transes and my LALA land so, i wasn't paying much attention. then all of a sudden 8:45 comes around and we headed over back to the church. wow-great times. like i said last week, this week would be better for me not being shy! haha! i'm pretty sure what we did yesterday is what we're gonna be doing next week, about getting me there and back. who knows. i'll have to talk to Andrew about it!

But wow-i can't believe Andrew's dad gave me a ride home. i was REALLY REALLY REALLY glad too! i love being with Andrew. i also like being with his friends. they're fun to hang with. i don't know them that well but-still, they're fun to hang with. i SUCK at learning SOOOOO many new names all in one night-i couldn't remember everyone's name last week! this week was better though."

Because all my parents ever seem to do is either go play poker with Steve Rex or they just play on the computer. Seriously, the only time i can get on without buggin them is when they're not home. And it sucks, my parents are never home over the weekends, and Amber is normally doing something so, I'm normally home all by myself so, i normally end up getting on the computer then or on the phone, talking to my Andrew becuz i talked to all of my friends during the acutal week. That's a major reason why i hate Britney not being here. But, i know it's gonna be worse over the summer because Amber and Britney are gonna be out every weekend, and i'll be home by myself, like normal. Hopefully i'll get to go up to Warren a lot over the summer. I TRULY hope so."

Everyone was gone before i was (go figure). but wow, i wasn't sure whether i was gonna see Andrew at all this week. It was awesome that i could be with him out side of the LEC. He might be coming to the ""Rave Dance"" that we're having on Friday. We made a deal that he said I have to go to youth group and he would come to my dance-now he HAS to come to my dance. My friends that don't know him wanna meet him. If his mom can't take him to Y-ville, Tammy's boyfriend MIGHT go and pick him up. He told me last night where his mom lives, so, yeah...

and yesterday, wow, Andrew has his arms around me, it just sent chills down my spine. it was awesome. Next week I'm able to go too!! Cuz Spinney's gonna pick me up again. Yes, Spinney, i'm trying my best to like him, he's a ride to see my man, and he liked pickin me up last night, it gave him sumthin to do!

but wow, again, I also got to meet Lacey, Tony, and a bunch of their friends. it was kewl. i was trying SOOOOO hard not to be shy, but, it was really hard seeing how i was around a bunch of people i didn't know....but next week will be better."

I also went to the NFG CONCERT!!!!!!! IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!I loved it! I went with Britney and her friend Katie. Man, I was in the mosh pit most of the time. It was great! I also got kicked on the head from some dude crowd surfing.

Today, we went to PMEA State Ajdudication Festival for band in Bradford. The middle level band got Superior (which is the best you can get). After all the Y-ville people got out of the school, we found out the school got a bomb threat. Go figure, seriously.

(sorry..had to say that) anywayz...this morning, i had to go to the middle school for band, i came in during my 3rd period class, take a quiz...the normal stuff. my day was like any other, besides it was my 14th b-day...then i walk into lunch hearing ""did you see her arm??..."" ""it looks like she took a weed-waker to it..."" these were things that my best friends were saying about a gurl who also sits at our lunch table.

so, when she sat down at the table, with her lunch, she had her sleeves of her hoodie pulled up (why, i wish i knew), and she had bandages on both arms, one of them, you could see through. she cut herself. it scared me. she's a REALLY nice gurl. seriously! she's the most polite person i've EVER met. then ever since then, i've been thinking. more then i normally do. thinking ""wow, what happened? i thought she was happy! i never would've thought..."" the thing is, you can NEVER tell if someone is truly happy. it's hard to tell, serisously.

there is at least 5 gurls who i have heard about (NOT SAYING ANY NAMES) in the 8th grade at YHS who cut themselves. i hear that 2 do it for attention. those who do it for attention: DON'T...THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM SWEEPING OUR NATION! it's so wrong, i mean, cutting yourself isn't gonna solve ANYTHING!

just the thought of someone cutting themselves hurts me truly inside. i'm gonna pray for the people who do cut themselves, and if you do know anyone who cuts themselves, please help them. they need your help! they need to know that you love them and that they're not alone in this world!

okay, i needed to get that out, please reply if you have anything to say."

After we ate, Britney and Amber went to Heather Walter's place to babysit. I will NEVER go there ever again-those who are close to me know why. Anywayz-my parents went over to some place to play cards (like they do every other weekend).

i really had nothing else to do so, i got on the computer and waited for Andrew to call me cuz he said he was going to. 9 o' clock rolls around and i'm still waiting for him to call me....so i called him. Well, we didn't get off the phone with each other until 12:30. that's the longest i've ever been able to talk to someone on the phone. he's awesome. next time i talk to niki-i'm gonna have her write a poem about him. it'll be great!

Becuz she decided that she's not gonna take the 8th graders to the Bands In The Round (a concert that all 4 schools in Warren County play in..you'll have to see to understand). But, she's had 8th graders go like forever. Back when my sister was in 7th grade-she had 7th graders go! I remember becuz i had to spend my 8th b-day at that concert.

But anywayz, this isn't too much of an interesting day. A couple of my friends are really sad cuz of Sam Lewis' death. I'm trying to help the best i can but, it'll take them time to be happy again. i didn't know her that well, so i really don't have much to say about her.

One thing i do know is that today is the busiest day of my week. i go to praise band till 5:30, go home, eat dinner, do homework, leave for fuel at 7 until 8:30, go back home, straighten my hair, go to bed. i'm really tired right now but, there's really nothing i can do about it now. i was gonna just say i didn't feel good and leave but, i wouldn't be able to do anything after school.

Winterfest '05 was AWESOME! it was the best time EVER. I met a bunch of new and kewl people. The ""Heat King"" i was talking about in my last entry, if you bothered to read the survey, well, Mark Maze from Sugar Grove thought that it was cold in the Boys' Dorm, so, he turned up the heat on Friday night. It turned out to be 90 degrees in there. My friends Luke, Tony, Kyle, Jake, and Will were NOT happy about this. it was great! on Saturday: i made a pretty wood angel for my mom. i also made a really kewl journal. we also did FACIALS! it was SO much fun! the funniest thing was there was more GUYS than girls getting facials. man, great times at Winterfest. Hopefully i get to go to YAC this year but, who knows.

"event","Well, being the 9th of March-i'm turning 14 in 14 days! YAY! 14 isn't really an age to ""celebrate"" but i'm still gonna be older! lol! But yeah, for ""Oklahoma"" well-there's no saxophone parts for it.so i can't be in the pit..but, i'm kinda glad cuz i already have a lot going on.
     And being the month of March-jazz band started. There's no middle level jazz band...so, the 8th graders are in the Sr. High jazz band. it kinda sux cuz for me-it's music that's hard...being in middle level band you don't get THAT much experience. i'm gonna try my best though.
     Plus, today i have my Praise Band practice after school until 5:30. Then i get to go home, eat dinner, get a lil homework done, then at 7...i go back over to the Joy Hall for Fuel unil 8:30. Crazy...i know.
     It bothers me when i'm around my best friends and sumtimes i feel like i'm afraid that i'm gonna say the wrong things. I HATE FEELING LIKE THAT! when i'm around my best friends-i shouldn't be afraid of saying stuff but, after yesterday, i am. cuz my one best friend got mad at me for sumthing that i said that wasn't even directed at her! (okay, now that i got that out...) i gotta go finish getttin ready for school..."

"event","Well, I'm just sittin here, bored. Well, I'm not chatting with anyone cuz everyone is either not at their house or sleeping. This is FUN! NOT! Well, I rented two movies tonight-Raise Your Voice and Shark Tale. If you're majorly into music (like i am!), i think you'll like Raise Your Voice. I'm probably gonna stay up till like 2 watching movies. I haven't watched Shark Tale yet.
     I'm not sure if i'm doing ANYTHING this weekend. I hope I get to hang out with Andrew tomorrow. I really need to talk to him about it. Cuz, seeing how he goes to Beaty and I go to Youngsville and we only go to the LEC once a week-Thursday, we really don't get to see each other much. Plus, next weekend, I'm going to a Church Weekend Retreat-called Winterfest-so, there's that weekend. Then the NEXT saturday after that, my cuz is gettin married.
     This is really my first ""long-distance"" relationship. Well, when you're 13 and you can't drive even though Warren is 9 miles away, it seems like a long-distance relationship. But, I really like Andrew, a lot, and I know he feels the same way about me.
     But yeah, if I make the Oklahoma pit, my life will be crazy. Well, in the month of March, everything is gonna be crazy. For Bands-in-the-Round, I gotta learn 6 pieces of music (4 mass band pieces & 2 pieces only y-ville's doin). And for our Ajudication Festival, I have to learn 2 pieces of music (and the one piece is 3 pages long!!) Plus, trying to juggle school with the LEC, I just wanna make it in a really good music school for college. Some people don't think that music is a career but, music is a major part of my life. Yeah, you can call me a band fag, I truly don't care. I love being proud of something that i do and that i have talent. I don't get to brag about a lot of things so, it's nice to have something besides actually caring about school
     I am really tired and just saying things that need to be said. I feel like such a loser right now. But, it's all right. I just need tonight to be alone. Then, tomorrow I'll need to be around someone, especially Andrew. But yeah, I'm gonna go watch Shark Tale, after I send a quick e-mail."

     It's been a great day for me, though. I have all the thanx in the world to Lacey-thank you SOOO much!
     Oh yeah, Ashley-YOU STUPID KIDS! that was HILARIOUS! Great times at the LEC! We have a lot of them! And we're gonna have a lot more, especially on the way THERE. Jay-Z and Linkin Park man!! LOL!! All the people think we're NUTS. Oh well, we are!
     But yeah-like I said-it was a great day but, I gotta go practice for my ""Oklahoma"" audition @ 6:30 (i'm playing in the pit people, i can't be on the cast!)"

     i really need to get this out. the guy i like, well he had a girlfriend just recently. well, she did stuff with another guy, which i find a little slutty, that that's beyond the point. i was really happy cuz ya know, i liked him, he had a girlfriend, she broke up with him, so now he's single. but, i was really trying to be there for him cuz ya know, now we're really good friends and everything. and i felt sad cuz he was sad about it.
     i'm not gonna go after him right away. i'll give it time, ya know. if it's supposed to happen (which i believe it is), it will.
     but yeah, we were supposed to have a band assembly at the middle school but, now we're not, obviously! i hope we don't have it tomorrow cuz then i'll have both wednesday and thursday to make up for periods 1-3. that would majorly suck! especially cuz 2nd period is my math class!"

"event","Well, I've been home since yesterday from Jamie's house. It's nice. There's nothing wrong with staying at Jamie's house or anything it's just that it's not...home. I'm just sitting here waiting for Momma and Poppa C to get home.
     For all of you who didn't know, my parents went to Las Vegas. They left on Sundy. So, I stayed at Jamie's house. And they should be home around 10:30 or 11.
     On Monday, we didn't have school. So, Jamie's mom took me and Jamie shopping. We got our cartliges pierced too. I love it. It was fun. We got lost in Home Depot! That was funny. Well, Jamie needed to go to the bathroom and we couldn't find her mom! We ran outside to see if she was there, ran back inside and it took us like 5-10 minutes to finally find her.
     Thursday was our Mid-Winter Band Consert. It went very well. We're better than the Eisenhower band. HAHA! just thought i had to say that."

"event","Well huh. Not too much is happenin at the Cerrie house. Niki's here, but that ain't too important. Just kiddin Niki! but yeah, I'm bored. I went shopping earlier. I didn't buy anything but, that was okay. 
     My parents are leaving for Las Vegas tomorrow. I'm staying at Jamie Hannold's house until Friday when Britney comes home. But yeah, we don't have school on Monday so, it's gonna rock!
     My concert for band is this Thursday. Bunches of fun there! Well, I prolly will like it, I like all of my concerts. Even though on Wednesday, I have to deal with the stupid lil 6th graders that I can't stand sometimes but, that's probably the way the 8th graders felt about me when I was in 6th grade.
     But yeah, Mr. Reynolds makes me mad sometimes! He was saying how like the more the LEC students go there, the lower our test scores go-oh well, I don't care about him anymore! lol. He's funny but, that's okay.
     But yeah, I'm sick. I have a stuffy nose and a sore throat. I'm gonna yell at whoever got me sick. I was around a lot of people who were sick so, I ain't sure who gave me the cold. Oh well!"

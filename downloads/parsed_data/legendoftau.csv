Today was the first day of term and my sleep cycle is fucked. Problem is I woke up at 3pm on Saturday and had the cunning plan of going to bed at 3pm on Sunday to try and forcefully sort my cycle out. This kind of backfired. I spent the allnighter writing some rather crazy template stuff in C++ and then crashed at 3pm, whereupon I slept fitfully and interruptedly for the next nine hours, at one point waking up half thinking like a normal human being and half thinking like a compiler munching on my code that couldn't compile a ""go to sleep"" function or something. I'm not making this up, sleep deprivation really fucks with your head.

Net effect: I was a zombie during my lectures and had to go home before my last one because I just couldn't stay awake. I think it's more or less calmed down though and I'll wake up at 7am in a good semblance of working order (9am lectures are fucking awesome).

My flat is also a complete state and I want to murder someone for it. While I was at home during December some builders were doing some council-ordered mandatory structural repairs. Which they did, but then they decided to leave every surface covered with an inch of filth, the furniture rearranged and my bed dismantled, and the walls unpainted and covered in big gobs of plaster, and just call it a day. Hey, what's the tenant going to do, complain? My management company (already not on my good side due to me needing to call then TEN TIMES AND WAIT TWO MONTHS BEFORE THEY FIXED MY FUCKING TOILET) of course did not go around and inspect the place, so I returned between christmas and new year when everything was closed for a week to a bomb site.

Then they reopened after taking a very generous non-state holiday of their own and after I chased them for three days straight they sent a single cleaner around on Friday, who as near as I can tell just poured some bleach down my toilet and fucked off.

I swear they're TRYING to piss me off or something. This is most likely going to end up in court I'm sure, esp since I'm going to get them to refund my rent for all the time my flat's messed up, whether they like that or not.

Other than that things are going pretty well. Certainly my sim project's keeping me occupied enough to take my mind off things. Originally I was going to write a bunch of Python extensions that one could write arbitrary rhythm games on top of... this is a nice concept, but the problem there is that it ended up with about 1000 lines of OS wrappers and audio/video loading donkey work, about 300 lines of anything that actually looks like a rhythm-action game, and 7000 lines of (admittedly autogenerated) godawful mess to connect it all to Python and back again. Also, due to said Python connection it's basically like what I've heard programming for C++ under the .NET CLR is like: i.e. you can't use the good stuff in C++ but instead have to dumb it down to the simplest language features to make the binding anything other than absolutely horrific.

I kinda got it to work even. Even though it chewed 60% of a 2GHz CPU shovelling data back and forth between Python and C++ I wrote a IIDX frontend for it in Python and I could play the Happy Sky keysound pack with totally lagless CS timing thanks to my custom sound engine. Which was pretty awesome, although I had to use the keyboard to play because it turns out all my PSX->USB adaptors lag like hell.

In the end I threw that past two month's worth of work in the bin and started again, for the ninth time now, simply because the previous incarnation couldn't have possibly evolved into anything other than a horrible mess of spaghetti code. Sorry, but I'm doing this properly or not at all. I've changed tack a bit: it's still going to support multiple game types but those will all be done in C++ which will make the design loads easier. However I'm going to use Lua to drive the user interface... kinda like what Blizzard seems to have done with WoW's user interface customisations although I don't play WoW or anything so I just looked at the gist of it. Lua's pretty zippy if you don't do anything too intense with it, and I'll just relegate it to positioning UI elements and maybe drawing particle and tweening whizbangs.

Hope to god ninth time's the charm because although I reuse bits of code here and there between iterations it gets really tiring writing certain bits of code over and over and over again."

"event","Being at home sucks my ability to get ANYTHING done. Someone force me to work somehow damn it. I've got stuff that needs to be finished. Like my Sun Labs application for a start: i.e. I get to spend a year in California working for Sun if this is successful. There's 6 places up for grabs in all of Scotland and last year Edinburgh uni got 4 of them. I'm pretty sharp with C++ and Java and a bunch of other stuff and I can actually design something that won't fall apart after a few thousand lines of code so I reckon I'm in with a good chance. Knowing my luck I'll probably not get it though..

I want to do some more jitsu :( damn all these clubs for closing down over the holidays (what do you mean people have lives) I want to throw people/get thrown around a bit. Gonna be breakfalling around my room before long if this keeps up.

Back to Edinburgh on Tuesday at least. Hooray for completely insane off the wall new year's festivities! Hopefully Alp will be doing something, there's always the flat party this guy at the Edinburgh jitsu club is throwing."

"event","Ah well, seeing as I'm not actively doing much of anything at home, this should prove to be interesting.

Tomorrow I'm going along to Biggleswade to help with the local club's Jitsu demo at a fair of some sort. I don't know too much about what this involves, other than some part of it is going to take place on the back of a moving lorry.... which should be fun as long as I don't get hurled off it by an overeager Ippon sei o nage or something. Heh, but hey, this should be fun. I play loads of DDR and ITG so I'm used to making a complete fool of myself in public already.

Actually speaking of Jitsu I'm getting to the stage where I'm a lot more confident now. Techniques that have been a pain for a very long time are finally starting to make sense, things are getting a lot more fluid and natural, and I'm already starting to do some more advanced stuff like diving over crouched people, doing a handstand then overbalancing it and doing a controlled fall, or doing a forward flip over my own arm to disentangle myself from a wristlock (all of which were quite scary propositions at first!). Even throws that I used to dread and which gave me bruises all over my legs are effortless to land from now. This is really getting fun!

Also I'm actively looking for a job of some sort now. I still don't actually need the money, but hey I'm 20 in less than a month and I should probably have been gainfully employed by this point. That and it'll give me an incentive to get out of bed before noon, which I find does wonders for one's motivation, as well as generally not being a miserable sod all day long. We'll see if Tesco will pay me to sit behind a checkout for eight hours a day. Failing that there's temp agencies I guess.

Ho hum. Hopefully I'll find more stuff to do out of the house while I'm at it."

Okay I'm a computer programmer, and I know a few things about electronics (I could probably remember what the rules for series and parallel circuit voltages are). As a craftsman... well, I can make a piece of wood with some nails sticking out of it if pushed. So for some reason I decided ""hey let's buy some Sanwa buttons and make a really awesome ASC"", because it's probably a bit easier than making a DDR mat (and it almost worked as well! Shame I made it when I was struggling with even 7 foots so I knew fuck all about what a good mat should feel like)

Anyway yeah, unlike the time when I tried to make a DDR/Pump it up overambitious 9 panel monster I'm actually living in a really big house now with a spare 'workshop' room, and I've actually lashed together a rudimentary workshop type facility with such cutting edge (GET IT) tools as a Jigsaw and even a workbench! Clamps coming tomorrow. Anyway, yeah I finally got off my arse and tried to make an ASC. I've sliced off a piece of Perspex to practice on and I'm starting to get the hang of it...

<lj-cut text=""Pix plz"">

<a href=""http://comqas.plus.com/~tau/design.png"">Design schematic (huge)</a>

Basically the idea is to try and make something like two KO's glued together but with Sanwa buttons and taking up as little space as possible. I couldn't care less about 'arcade exactness' and I'm not spending 300 odd quid just to make it harder to play on; that's like the opposite of what I'm trying to do :}

Anyway, after asking a friendly builder how the fuck to cut square slots into something with a jigsaw (there's loads of builders swarming around our house finishing up renovations) I finally took one into my trembling hands and tried to do something with it. Observations:

1. Some sort of really intense and thin guide lines are needed, because by hand I get about 3mm of wonk each way, which doesn't sound like much but sure as hell doesn't look straight to the naked eye

2. Perspex is the most fucking annoying material EVER. It snaps, it bends, and god forbid you try to take a drill to it because the sworf MELTS and fills up the hole again with a lump of gunk if you do it wrong. So all the blades/bits have to be as slow as possible so as not to cause fracture lines to appear and it's generally really annoying.

A sheet of perspex about .. oh five feet by three feet set me back twenty quid (that's about $40). A slightly bigger piece of MDF cost about four ($8). So yeah, it's expensive too. But anyway, after drilling corner pilot holes, drilling bigger holes, fannying around loads with the jigsaw I managed to get a hole sliced into it:

<img src=""http://comqas.plus.com/~tau/tmp1.jpg"" />

That actually looks quite pants but a Sanwa sits completely snugly in it:

<img src=""http://comqas.plus.com/~tau/tmp2.jpg"" />

</lj-cut>

Getting them not to sit on a wonk will be quite a challenge but tomorrow I'll have a go at cutting a whole white row into my practice Perspex sheet, then maybe I'll make two sheets of buttons for real.

Haha, then I'll think about how the fuck I'm going to make a turntable. That should be fun; I've got an optical encoding circuit courtesy of fdavie now but only a vague idea of the actual mechanics of it all. I'm going to use carriage bolts for the spindles.

Still, this is fun. And even that one Sanwa button on its own feels absolutely gorgeous. Feels almost exactly like Troc's BM 3rd mix only not quite as worn in. Which reminds me I really need to go to the Troc with my camera someday and take some photos of me and some mates before the place shuts down for good. London Trocadero closing makes me very sad :( :( :( now I'll never get to bust out Setsugekka 7k there surrounded by a crowd of hot azn girls (heh.)"

Hmm. So, exam session. Things got off to a cracking start when I failed my first two exams, both of which were third year level though. The format of those is quite fun: 40% of the marks for part A, and then two out of three questions from part B worth 60% each. I decided to be clever in the first exam and went ""Hmm. Well, this question took 10 minutes to figure out just what they were ASKING, this is a good bet"". Discrete programming and Game Theory then. That could have gone better. Think Holic[a].

The second one was just lol. Evil geometry and partial differential equations stuff. Which I basically knew fuck all about. The first question was ""State the general form of a matrix in SO(2)"" ie basically what is a rotation matrix. This is the starter for six. I didn't know. Kinda went downhill from there. OTOH the Section B questions were actually not that bad, so maybe I merely got a D as opposed to failing entirely.

After that things began to look up: Comp Sci 2B was just lol; there was a huge algorithms and data structures segment which they just didn't examine us one and the rest was really rather easy. Linear Algebra went well too, but that module was rather well taught (the head of the maths dept was our lecturer) so everyone knew it inside out.
</lj-cut>

All in all though, it's not going to be a stellar second year set of results =\ so much for having an actually interesting third year placement then. On the flipside, The Project is finally gaining momentum! Could have picked a better time I suppose, but I just need to finish integrating a few classes and the sound system will be finished. At which point I write the input layer, then hook up a IIDX controller and I've got something that plays keysounds without lag, something that seems to have evaded Konami from 9th AC onwards...

Now I've just got to design the actual gameplay engine (basically polish up the design from Notesmash and make it scriptable) and write a user interface system. Eee, this is so exciting!

(The song I'm listening to is quite interesting as well. Think Hardcore of the North on some rather peculiar drugs)"

Generally, Edinburgh's still really fantastic. I remember when I came here for the open day I thought the city was gorgeous and that feeling hasn't gone away at all. Today the weather is thoroughly crap but yesterday it was fantastic; I decided to go for a walk, so I descended the stairwell, rounded a corner and was standing on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Street"">Princes Street</a> (did I mention that I love my current flat's location?). The gardens are beautiful this time of year as well, loads of cherry trees (OMG SAKURA SUGOI ^________^ etc) in full bloom. I really wish I had a camera; as in, not my POS phone camera. Then proceeded onwards down the Meadows generally wandering around thinking bout this that n the other.

Pointless segue, but I thought I'd point that out. There's literally not a day that goes by that I don't thank the powers that be that I'm here; mostly because I have to cross North Bridge or climb the Mound to get anywhere from where I live, and it's a bit hard not to stand there and stare out across the city centre from there. Even though I've lived here for two years now.

Eh, I'm really not revising as much as I should be, and my first exam is on Fri. I'm at least getting some done today though but it's really not as much as it should be. This WILL end badly, and I've never been wrong about any pessimistic predictions I've made here. Ugh.

Apart from that though, I've been feeling pretty good lately. There's a lot of stuff that I have that I simply don't appreciate, so I'm quite content with how things are now. Yeah exams are on so things not as good as they could be, but then, eh, exams are only once a year from now on anyway. I'll deal. I've got a few projects lined up for the summer as well."

Basically people from the V come up to you and try to attack, in rapid succession. Obviously you've got to block the attack, and from then on you have to deal with them somehow, for instance put them in an arm or wrist lock, or throw them. If you really stuff it up then you can pretend to do a critical point strike; eyes, throat, solar plexus etc (haha, there were a few little kids grading with us and they were told to sit down and look away as we went through the critical point katas). 

About half of the attackers try to punch you in the nose, the other half are armed with plastic bottles and try to twat you over the head with them. It's all a bit artificial because it's just one attacker at a time, and after they do the punch they just stand there so that you can lock/throw them, but you will actually get decked rather hard in the face if you don't even block, and they're still great because the whole point of the exercise is for the guy up at the front to show off. I don't see why everyone seems to hate them to be honest.

We'll find out who passed and what calibre of belt they got tonight, but then pretty much nobody fails gradings so I'm not too fussed.

Anyway apart from that uni is plodding along as well as can be expected. I'm a fucking winner and forgot about my tax return for last year, so I lost 100 quid due to that =\ am rather poor now as a result. My sim project is still not getting off the ground because getting the groundwork done is a major pain in the arse... that's about it really.

I'm feeling a lot better lately, although really bugger all is actually going on; it's just go to lectures, do assignments, hang out with friends every now and again, go to Jitsu a few times a week and that's about it. Hopefully something interesting will happen soon.

"event","Remember last year when I was going on about how fantastic my marks were and how hopeful I was about the future. Yeah, well, things aren't quite going so smoothly anymore. Basically I'm pulling straight C's on my handins and my exam results from the first semester ... kinda left something to be desired (I got a low A in Computer Science, very low A in Probability, B's in the two Calculus modules and a fucking D in Statistics 1). In fact, looking at the coursework marks table I'm somewhere towards the bottom quarter of the class on the coursework side of things. It's got to the point where I just don't care about my coursework as it's only 20% of the final module grade, and as long as I average above 40% I'll be eligible to sit the exam. Which I'm managing, just about, but it's just.... ugh.

The thing is I can salvage it if I actually bother to revise for the exams; I can drag all of these modules up to a mid A grade if I deliver the goods exam day; which is still not THAT hard, although it's no walk in the park like first year. I'm just so lazy lately it's disgusting though :\ It just feels unreal. Last year I was thinking of getting some sort of awards, going to the top 20% and qualifying for the Sun Labs sandwich year in the US, blazing through it all and getting a first. Now... well, second year has kinda shot my academic record to hell, although only third and fourth year count towards the degree so I still want to get a first at the end of the day.

That requires some motivation though, which is a bit hard to draw from scraping along the bottom. Even in Comp Sci I'm not doing that great; yes I'm getting A's, but that's not so impressive when half the class is getting like 90% and I'm getting 80 and I don't fucking know WHY because this is stuff that I knew when I was fourteen for the love of god.

I think I'll actually just ship my computer and PS2 back down south and just LEAVE it there; if I need a PC to do an assignment I'll do said assignment at the Informatics labs (which is what I do now anyway).

Gah. I don't know why I even bother if this is how my life is going to go every single time, just plodding along and not really accomplishing anything. Last year I had jack all social life, but at least my grades were decent, so I felt I'd accomplished SOMETHING. Now I don't have even that.

- Growth rates of a few functions
- Big-O of some small bits of pseudo code
- Some completely random thing about pearls and magic wands
- Implement two different kinds of associative array
- Benchmark them
- Direct Big-O analysis of the Java code
- Compare and contrast with benchmark figures, comment

Basically a GREAT BIG FUCKING WASTE OF TIME THAT TEACHES ME FUCK ALL. Except maybe the implementing your own containers thing (except the real world usually just uses hash tables for anything serious and not unbalanced trees BUT NEVERMIND, this is actually way simpler anyway). I have also got two Maths handins, although at least one of them's easy, the other one is Statistics though which I detest with every fibre of my being.

Oh and of course it's Valentine's Day as of three hours ago. Yes, not only do I get gang raped by three assignments at once (I know I brought this on myself by not scheduling things properly, shut up) but I get to enjoy just about every public space turning into a great big makeout session as well. In the next 24 hours I suppose at least 100 million people will be getting laid, guess who's not among their number.

I don't particularly care about that right now. I'm sure a little bit later once I've finished doing a half-assed job of all these handins I will though.

Anyway, played copious amounts of ITG and some Fusion. Impressions:

FUSION

Good
- Nice framerate
- Licenses aren't that bad
- Dive was on there, maybe we'll have some old school tracks that weren't on Ex?

Bad
- Holy desync batman. This is even worse than EM2, everything is VERY early
- Goatse timing windows. I AAAed Sync Heavy, despite the sync being whacked
- The stepzone has Marvelous flashes but no Oni courses on the test machine. Hmm...
- Demo machine had like 50 songs on it. There will be more songs on it in the full ver apparently.

If it actually does end up having 200+ songs and they sort the timing out then it will be a good mix, and it will be nice to see ubiquitous Extreme-type machines as opposed to EM2s (EM2 is to be fair a decent mix with a good but limited songlist, but it gets boring fast)

ITG

Good
- USB Sticks and everything associated with them: detailed HTML stats, screenshots, cross-credit combos etc.
- Some REALLY nice licenses. I must admit I like Filo Bedo's stuff quite a bit even if it is a bit generic
- Expert level songs are difficult in an interesting way, and in a lot of cases are really creative. 
- Originals aren't too bad either
- Nice graphics. Looks very pretty and smooth.
- Interesting timing windows. AAAs aka FECs are definitely way easier than on DDR Extreme (having said that I didn't get any) but still challenging, that and you've got Marvelous type timing to add more to it.
- Sync is BANG ON (well MAYBE a fraction late but I think that's just me). This is what you get when a bunch of PA nuts make a DDR machine
- Didn't try Marathon courses but the preprogrammed mod storm idea is very nice
- Looks like it's fairly newb friendly as well; the Tutorial is well explained and dissuades people from standing in the middle (though a couple of passers by managed to miss every single arrow in the tutorial because they couldn't quite grasp that you follow the SCREEN and not the stage lights, despite watching me play beforehand)

Bad
- Main gripe: BUGGER ALL CHART VARIETY BELOW TEN FEET. Nuff said. Seriously it's like DDR Udderdude Mix (and Udderdude is the guy who did most of the <10 foot charts). The charts are kinda fun but they're all exactly the same. Charts don't have to be very hard to be interesting and this is going to bore newbies like nothing else, which won't be good for ITG's uptake.
- The Perspective thing is annoying. Yes ITG is not DDR, we get the idea. The notes do look like actual 3D polygons as opposed to just a single texture though."

"event","Oh yeah, what happened to doing things on time??

Here's a lesson I can't seem to learn: missing maths lectures results in much wailing and gnashing of teeth as I haven't got the faintest idea what the flying FUCK is going on. So I've got my next five maths modules off to a fucking cracking start: Two of them had their first handin on Tues, both of my solutions were somewhat incomplete (last one was just a small question left out but when someone else gave me the answer it was fucking obvious).

Now there's one due for Fri. I realised this this morning, 3 minutes before I had to leave to get my train. Panicked and wondered how to get the solution done and next-day delivered before 5pm today when I realised I could email an electronic version of the solution to my flatmate and have her print it off and hand it in. God bless technology. Two questions, both were complete greek to me, which is not surprising because I've missed about half of the lectures because I'm a lazy cunt and cba to get up at 8am for them. Which is quite pathetic considering most schoolkids wake up at 7am at the latest.

Four handins per module, the best three of which count, so you can miss one provided you do the other three to a good standard. Which I'm going to have to do because I can't make heads or tails of this fucking thing.

I'm awfully nonchalant for someone who's circling the drain. Urgh, and I was so bent on trying to sort myself out too... >:| Tomorrow's going to suck somewhat because of this.

Oh and exam results will probably be released online tomorrow too. I don't think I did as well as I'd have liked there either. Urgh. I am officially not leaving Edinburgh for the rest of the term after this, I'm really fucking up, but then any resolutions I make lately hold about as much water as sieve at the moment."

Anyway, yeah wow life's actually going good lately. Yesterday my flatmate took me to a Ju Jitsu introductory session. Which was actually pretty awesome. Quick introduction to Ju Jitsu: it is a few hundred different sets of motions you can insert into ???

1. Guy throws a punch/kick, grabs your throat and starts strangling you, comes at you with a knife, shoves you, etc

2. ???

3. Guy is in a lock, pin, or on the ground clutching a broken limb. In less extreme cases he's just brushed past you.

Note that it uses momentum and body mass and such so it still works if the agressor is a lot bigger and stronger than you. Or there's several of them (up to a point I mean if there's like 6 rugby player looking people you're probably fucked). Anyway yeah you can't spar or initiate a fight with Ju Jitsu, but judging by the stuff the higher belts were doing it actually looks really practically useful once you get all the moves fluid and working reflexively. That and it looks really neat. Oh and they're a nice and social lot, and each training session ends up with a round down at the pub (usually of water, because everyone's fucking knackered after a three hour session by this point). A few hotties there too :} I chatted with a new girl for a while. So did about five other blokes. She had a ""Yes I know I'm hot and I'm getting really tired of being hit on every five minutes"" type air about her. Ah well :|

Then I went off with a bunch of friends to play Mah Jong (not the silly tile stacking thing, the four-player Poker-type game... except it's with bricks and not cards). Which was fun and I won with a quite large score, 2 to the power 12 or something (the scoring is multiplicative) aand then I went home to bed. Weekend should be fun, more Dundeefun there, although if that falls through there's another party plus a Saturday Jitsu session, so either way the weekend should be interesting.

Nick if you're reading this then actually answer on MSN at some point! =P

Oh yeah and ATEI in a week, rock on :D Life is good. Except the Maths department are being arsish and not releasing our marks until next bloody week... I suppose I shouldn't worry because there's no way in hell I failed anything (well touch wood but it would be VERY unexpected), although as of next year things start to count toward the degree so I kinda want to be sure I'm starting off on the right foot. So no if I say I want straight A's that's not me being arrogant. Saying ""oh yay I got mid 90%'s on everything"" would be arrogant (N.B. I didn't so far. Try mid 70's, BARELY A's, so I have a right to be worried =P )

Finally here's a fun riddle a friend of mine gave me. Doesn't really require anything more than simple algebra and a bit of deduction with inequalities. Here it is:

<lj-cut text=""The hardest riddle ever"">
All answers are either True, False or an integer.

1. What is the sum of all the numerical answers to this quiz, including this one?
2. How many questions have an answer of True?
3. Question 1 has the highest numberical answer. True/False?
4. How many answers are the same as this one, including this one?
5. All numerical answers are positive. True/False?
6. What is the average of all the numerical answers, including this one?
7. The answer to 4 is greater than the answer to 2. True/False?
8. What is the answer to 1 divided by the answer to 8?
9. Q6 = Difference between Q2 and Q4 minus Q8*Q4. True/False?
10. What is the answer to this question?
</lj-cut>

Will post the answer and working (not official but my answer seems consistent) if anyone actually gives a crap.

Take it easy :}"

Upshot being that after a lecture I just about get what's going on, then after doing most of a tutorial sheet it seems much more elegant and fits together better. And makes me think about it. I'm such a maths nerd :} Glad I'm at least doing something I find interesting, because Comp Sci is still boring as hell. Least it's easy though (I'm sorry =X but it is for me)

Oh yeah and IIDX is going awesome. I had about seven AAAs or something in all of half a year of playing. Then since Sunday I've AAAed in no particular order:

Yesterday L7
Burning Up For You 7k
CSFIL L7
I Feel... L7 (maybe, I don't remember)
Love Me Do L7
Love Will... L7 (FINALLY)
Marmalade Reverie L7
Murmur Twins L7
Over The Clouds L7
Remember Me L7
Secret Tale L7
Starmine L7 (again, don't remember)
Sound of Goodbye L7
Dancer L7
Halfway of Promise L7
Love is Orange L7
Monkey Dance L7 (maybe)
Star Dream L7
V35 L7

which makes about 19 AAAs in three days. Nice.

Also 195k'ed Bit Mania L7 (45 or so plain greats which actually puts me pretty high up on VJ Army...)

Tried and failed to sleep through it (went to bed at about 10pm, didn't fall asleep until 2am). I feel 2004 has been a waste (yes Italy was fun but I mean I didn't really get anything productive accomplished outside of just following my course), and I've got a plan of action for making damn sure the same won't be true of 2005.

Also, I threw out the design for my sim, again, and started afresh with something that is a lot more elegant than before, but like all my past projects rewriting the same foundations five times over gets really really dull. I think I've got a rough idea where this one is headed but there's a whole lot more boring shitwork to lay the foundations too =\

Thing is I spent most of today thinking about it, and I don't know any proper methods of software design (well, okay I know the gist of some which involve like ten developers but they're really overkill here) so it's seriously doing my head in. It's like trying to solve a massive integral completely in your head... at least once all the foundations are in place it's just a matter of filling in the rest of the blanks. Tch, and I wanted to have it working at a basic level by the new year too.

- Stat Methods: Eek. Started off on the wrong foot, couldn't possibly have A'ed this

- Computer Science 2A: Could have done that in my sleep. Actually I more or less did (see sleep cycle) and I took ages to do it.

Worst case scenario is CBBAA, best case BAAAA, and it's probably leaning towards worst case to be honest =\ I'd really rather not worry about this for now though, we'll see in January.

<lj-cut text=""RAVIOLI"">
1. What did you do in 2004 that you'd never done before?
Actually pull some reasonably decent exam results

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
I don't do new year's resolutions. I stopped going to the gym I suppose.

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
No.

4. Did anyone close to you die?
Hm.. my friend's goddaughter died of birth defects. That was quite sad :{

5. What countries did you visit?
ITALY

6. What would you like to have in 2005 that you lacked in 2004?
A girlfriend.

7. What dates from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
Blowing my chance with a girl I fancied because I was too late by the time I worked up the balls to ask her out (no it wouldn't have worked anyway but that was a really stupid way of arriving at that nonetheless). The Italy trip was good fun.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
getting eight A's and a B for my first year uni modules

9. What was your biggest failure?
My social life. Disappointing but not unexpected.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Nope, both of these are dependent on me actually getting out every now and again.

11. What was the best thing you bought?
IIDx 7th&8th

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?
Again, nobody comes to mind.

14. Where did most of your money go?
DDR

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
IIDX 8th, Italy trip, unknown possibilities in the future (that amounted to nothing)

16. What song will always remind you of 2004?
Probably Gravity. Doesn't hold a candle to 2003's associations though, listening to Flip & Fill - Field of Dreams makes me want to cry because of the memories it brings up.

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
a) happier or sadder? Both really... I'm less insecure but fuck all happened in 2004
b) thinner or fatter? Pretty much exactly the same
c) richer or poorer? Poorer I suppose because I'm building up a student loan debt.

Hm, Good Omens. But then that was the only book I read.

dull

what's a celebrity

Hmmmmmmmmm. Nobody that I didn't really know from 2003.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2004:

"event","Heh, well someone at Registry really screwed the pooch with the exam timetabling. Next week I've got lectures and an assignment due on Weds for computer science. Then the week after that I've got two exams ... and then three in a row the week after that.

I didn't actually realise this until yesterday so I spent most of today getting geared up for it, mostly bits of past papers, printing stuff off, reading old notes and the like. Assessments have been a bit... rocky lately and this semester's got a lot of not particularly difficult but awkward maths in it. Two modules' worth of calculus and two stats/probability modules, and a computer science module to keep things interesting. I'm hoping to pull another load of straight A's, but with the damage I've taken in coursework (ugh, bad time planning...) that might prove rather difficult.

If I pull it off though, I can probably get quite a shiny letter of recommendation from my tutor.. ""Well, he's had 13 A's and one B so far, so he's quite suitable academically etc etc"" and that might up my chances of getting a placement in Japan next year.

Which I would like very much, because then I'll get to drive a mech to work (because everyone knows Japan is JUST LIKE IT IS IN THE ANIMES LOL) but seriously it would be quite fantastic if I could manage it, so hopefully I can draw enough motivation from that to get there.

Well, either way it'll all be done in three weeks, here's hoping I don't fuck it up.

Least it's something to do though. I'm actually quite cheerful lately, yey :}

- Overall rather disappointing actually... hardly any fun songs at all and way too much Generic Trance Tripe
- Step into a new world = WHAT THE FUCK. This is actually the hardest new 7k for me so far, I couldn't even break 10%...
- War Game is also nuts, it's like 5.1.1[a]'s bastard little brother
- So far Please Don't Go, Monkey Dance, Colors Y&Co and Airflow are the only reasons I like this style =\ in that they're the only nice sounding songs which also have fun charts (a lot of great songs are let down by rubbish charts)
- I want DBAM to unlock...

Despite that I still played until my pinkies felt like they're about to fall off but I hope it gets better as I go along."

"event","Ehhhh... Somewhere I Belong. Every line of this seems to resonate with me. Every damn line. Seems to be the story of my uni experience thus far. Maybe the fact that these shall we say ""alternative pop"" lyrics resonate so strongly with me seems to indicate that I'm really not very different from everyone else at all, but then isn't that really a given anyway. *sigh* I dunno, I had a load of supar insightful stuff!!!1one to write here but I'll jot down what fragments I may here.

I still don't know where I'm headed. I know I can pull whatever grades I fancy but I always seem to keep my head down in all senses.. mostly in that I don't see more than a few steps ahead. Complete tomorrow's Discrete Programming assignment. Revise like fuck for the five modules' worth of exams I have for Christmas and get another load of straight A's. Complete the year in a satisfactory manner. Get a good degree. And. Well... then what.

I've been wanting to go to Japan for a year out between 3rd and 4th year. I'm learning the language in preparation for that (well... I've learned the Hiragana and Katakana. So I suppose I'm ready to START learning would be the more accurate statement). Good grades are obviously a necessary condition for this. But beyond that I don't want to remain in the UK... something tells me I want to see the world. Other parts tell me I don't like England and the total and utter lack of goings on here. Maybe. But I think I've figured it out earlier this week.

I know what I really want to do once I finish uni at the moment is to pack a single bag, and my bank account details, and step on a plane and go somewhere and never look back. America. Japan. Canada. Italy. Maybe even New Zealand for fucks sake. I dunno why, perhaps it feels romantic but the theory I hit upon is that it feels very empowering. Looking at all the internship and graduate recuritment people swarming around the uni in ebbs and flows throughout the year I feel there should really be more to life than spending 21 years lubing yourself up and then spending the next 40 being raped in the arse and fucking liking it. Our parents, our teachers, we all seem to have some sort of cozy career path laid out for us, going through the hoops whether it's a slavelike 'career' progression or learning the correct technique to do well in an exam. Just coast along not making a difference, being told what to want by all the suffocating advertising and then enjoying the new plasma screen TV, the holiday abroad or whatever... then being tossed aside after you're no longer useful to enjoy a modest pension of some sort. If you're lucky. Forgive me for being overly philosophical when I've quite probably got no clue what the fuck I'm on about but this is all I see ahead of me and I really don't like it. What's the point of working for something when it's all been laid out for you in all its pointlessness anyway.

Yeah, I'm moving offtopic. Jump on a plane and go somewhere. I find the idea empowering because it breaks that. It lets me kinda take some initiative and throw it all to the wind, introduce some real uncertainty into it. The decision I'd make as to where to go next would completely randomize the rest of my life and maybe put some adventure back into things. Bit like the illusion I had on the first day when I arrived at uni. That was a totally clean break; finishing school, and my parents would be shortly moving out and going somewhere completely different to where I'd spent years 10-17 of my life. And then the first week. Who would I meet? What would I do with them and where would that take me? what courses would I embark on and how would I do? Things were truly unknown and adventurous and it felt great. And it's funny how some things still haven't changed, like I remember how I got the roots of one damn crush back then and I STILL can't shake it (and probably won't until I find myself someone which at this rate may as well be never). Not to mention the fact that I'm still as much of a social cripple as I was back then or at least certainly more than I'd like to admit. Perhaps I've failed this time around, perhaps I've learned something and succeeded more than I'd known. Either way I'd like to try again.

Hey, my parents and I arrived here with just one bag and the clothes on our back and turned ourselves around like nothing else (even if I didn't have much of a childhood due to what circumstances forced upon us). I'd like to try that, and I'd like to think that I'd succeed.

Heh, and I've completely forgotten even what my point is. Well, I'm sure I'll think what a mong I was in the morning. My real thoughts have probably still been more along the lines of wah wah wah i'm lonely and don't fit in, but I think I can see how this tangents fits into it ...... somehow. Drunkenness gives you an ephemeral ersatz happiness for a while before the inevitable crash.. which feels dangerously addctive and I'd do well to steer clear of relying on it.. it also makes you stupid and full of yourself (see this entry) but I can't help but wonder if it forces you to look at issues you usually manage to ignore.

"event","Kaay. Week and a half in, we've got an ADSL hookup so I might as well post an update. Although I should really be in bed.

I suppose it shouldn't be surprising that I still haven't got a job (I've handed in a grand total of one application form, bleh). Having said that I'm looking at this one job at the local Maplin (electronics shop) that seems perfect; three hours a day weekdays, and probably pays a bit above minimum wage. That and it's more aligned with my interests. Uni is getting geared up again, and the semester should be quite ... interesting. Someone really made a mess of the timetabling this year so one of the Maths modules collides with computer science. I'm taking the slightly risky approach of taking CS but not actually turning up to any of the lectures. The reasoning is that the lecture notes are very very good and detailed, and actually attending the lectures tends to send me to sleep. We'll see how that one goes, the goal is to keep my straight A streak going for a while. Aiming for 90%+ on all of them is ... well, I'm going to actually have to push my lazy arse quite a bit and I dunno if I can do that. Beats having to do what's basically A-Level Stats as one of my honours modules anyway.

Okay apart from that I've been staying in almost all the time, either getting moved in for the first few days or just generally being out of the fucking loop due to my complete fumbling of first year. Why is it that courses let you either meet loads of people and party like wild or actually get something done and get a degree that's actually good for something. The only intersection of those two that comes to mind is Medicine but I wouldn't have been able to take the workload. Ah well, irrespective of that you can't choose what you're interested in I guess.

Also these lofty ideals of getting stupidly high grades are a little silly when you skip an entire day like I did today. Freshers' Flu by the looks of things... and I'm not even a fresher anymore (why does that make me feel old? don't laugh). Tomorrow I'm going in whatever my condition is, I just hope my nose isn't running like a tap like it was on Monday.

Bleh, need to get out more. Ah well, what else is new :}"

"event","so apparently i'm a wallflower, with no voice, acting only after the people i love do. all hurdles that must be jumped, all things i'm afraid to say, all complications that must be worked out, can only be completed after SOMEONE ELSE has done so. (and as a RESULT of them doing so.) I am so glad there is someone in my life who knows absolutely nothing about me to tell me what i'm going to do and what petty reasons motivate those actions. basically, i am not  only a non-person, if you will, i am SOMEBODY ELSE! how could i have been so blind all of this time? how could i have been so stupid, to have not been able to see the fact that i don't know how to do things; don't do things, without someone else doing them first! what a fucking revelation! this whole time i thought i had discovered who i really am, become comfortable in my own skin, spoke comfortably and truthfully about my life in front of other people, but i was wrong. yes my friends, so horribly wrong. today i have learned an important lesson, that will surely prohibit me in enjoying and understanding the rest of my, excuse me, the rest of someone else's life that i believe is mine: I'M NOBODY. FUCK! Thank you so much, (insert name here), you wonderful, intelligent, charismatic, and apparently psychic/mind reading human being, for teaching me what i never knew. how could i ever repay you for this?"

"event","I feel so lonely. I used to have a voice. I don't know what's happened to me. I feel like I've lost all sense of myself. I'm constantly worried that the people I love don't really care about me; that I'm just a bother they feel sorry for. My insecurities make me feel stupid which in turn makes me feel more insecure. About love, about life. 

I fucking miss love. 

I'm so lonely.

And then I wonder if I'm just feeling sorry for myself and if any of these emotions are even real...

I realized recently for the first time how truly driven by fear I am. I never go out anymore and have become completely intimidated by large groups of people. I became aware of this the day before yesterday, when Becky wanted to go eat at a loud, crowded restaurant/bar, and I was afraid to go inside. I'm afraid of what people think of me. I've ceased doing so many of the things that I used to love. I've stopped trying new things. I hardly ever leave the house, and usually when I do it's to go somewhere I go every single night, or to work. I feel like I'm missing out on a world of possibilities. I feel like I'm cutting myself short. I've yet to experience so many things and all i do is sit back and watch on the sidelines. 

now i really am just feeling sorry for myself."

"event","Last night somebody told me that up until they met me, their life was normal, and that ever since they met me, storms have come and gone, drastic life-changing events have taken place, and everything has been altered in some way or another. 

Hmm...interesting. 

I'm sure that has absolutely nothing to do with me, but it's still something to think about."

"event","I feel trapped, I feel lost, I feel confused, and I can't remember the last time I felt this deeply hurt. Usually in some way, I'm in the wrong. Not completely, but I have  my part in the fight. This time around, I was not the instigator. I saw the whole thing coming and tried to turn the other way. I SAW her devising a plan. SAW the whole thing, plain as day,right before me. I fucking SAW the result she wanted and how she planned on getting that.Yet I felt guilty and horrible about the things that I said anyways, so I apologized, and was up front about MY PART in the situation. She threw it on the ground and stomped on it. I admitted to being wrong about things I know I wasn't, just to try and make things okay. Just so I wasn't living in a war zone. And look what happened. She has no respect for me and she feels she said/did nothing wrong. I'm in shock, I can't even put into words the way I feel right now. Apologizing isn't easy for me, especially when a number of the things I apologize for aren't really my fault. I swallowed my pride though, and tried to mend what's left of our relationship the best I could, just to allow some peace in this house and in her mind. And she had the nerve to tell me I was 100% in the wrong, that I did not apologize, and then she decided to pretend she couldn't hear me, like a fucking child. 

I've cried too much about it today, and talked about it too much as well. Right now I just feel numb, though I know that's merely wrapping paper around a box full of depression. All I want to do is sleep. Lately I feel like that's my only escape from this fucking mad house. When my mother and I fight, it isn't about a curfew I'm unhappy about or some typical adolescent disagreement. We don't have a normal mother daughter relationship. Atleast that's how it used to be, but somewhere along the line, the typical mother-daughter roles were completely erased. She didn't used to be this way, things didn't used to be this way. But then I wonder if they always were and I was simply too blind to notice, or too tired to care."

"event","I went too far today. I'm choosing to let my fear take control of me and it is paralyzing. I said some of the most hurtful things I've ever said in my entire life a couple of hours ago, and I feel absoulutely terrible. I'm grinding my teeth waiting in agony for time to pass by so I can begin a new minute, a new hour, a new day. I know exactly what I need to do in order to right this awful wrong, but it's the most difficult choice I have to choose from. It's the only choice.

My heart hurts."

"event","I'm feeling a lazy depression making it's way under my skin and I'm half-heartedly fighting it off. If I'm completely honest with myself, all I want to do is sleep. One side of me is welcoming this emotion with open arms, the other side is crawling away as fast as possible, because it's too tired to run. 

Now to be REALLY honest, I'm feeling totally and completely insecure about everything I can possibly feel insecure about. I also feel lazy and lost and am over flowing with too many conflicting thoughts. 

Now to be REALLY REALLY honest. I wanted to cut myself today. There, I've gone and done it, I've gotten to the bottom of things and do not as a result, feel any sense of freedom or peace with myself. Somehow that not-so-simple statement has unleashed a world of pain and consumed every last molecule of energy within me by trying not to cry. Why did I feel this way today? I'm sure God knows, but either he's keeping his mouth shut or I'm not listening.(little red arrows are pointing to the latter.) There was no particular reason I felt this way earlier, I wasn't sad, I wasn't angry, I wasn't feeling lonely. I was perfectly content. I simply looked at my arm (for what i just realized was the first time in quite a while), and saw that somewhere along the line it turned into a blank canvas. There's nothing wrong with that. That's precisely what I wanted only a few months ago. I think I'm simply taking so many steps in the right direction, so many huge steps, that I feel like I'm a completely different person than I was only three weeks ago. This isn't bad. I'm plain and simply, terrified of change, no matter how healthy it is. Those marks that used to be on my arms were a part of me and I feel like I'm losing pieces of myself. I sound insane,and no matter how hard I try there will never be a way to adequately explain this verbally, but this is how I feel. Pain was my very first addiction. My very first escape. It was so many different things. Things that can no longer be, things that i no longer wish to be. Looking at my arm was having an actual visual of change. 

I'm not unhappy with my life. These words project that. I'm just scared shitless. And I still haven't completely explained myself."

"event","my heart hurts even worse than my stomach does. dear God please say he'll be okay. i can't tell which part of me feels worse. how can something so awful happen to one of the most wonderful people on the planet. all i can do is wait and pray and love him. that's all i can do, that's all anyone can do. i feel utterly powerless. when i saw him last night for the first time i thought i was going to vomit. 

he's alive, he's alive."

"event","Once i loved you, now i hardly know who you are. today our disagreement over opinions on movies was far more painful to me than the fact that you didn't say goodbye. you say you're leaving never to return without the bat of an eye lash or any attempt at avoiding eye contact with me. after a moment of unspoken desolation shared between us, you left me and i doubt i will ever see you again. and how can you expect me to make an effort to when you say you're leaving without a pang of guilt or regret?once i loved you.

today my pulse maintained fairly regularly and with far less pain involved than it did in the past few days. However, as soon as i was no longer accompanied by another like myself, i was filled with distress and lonliness. i no longer cherish my solitude as i used to. i seek to escape it as if my life depended on it."

"event","Pain doesn't work well with me and it feels even worse when laura feels it too. I've been trapped in this room for far too long and i'm forgetting what it looks like on the outside. Every now and again i crack open the door but lately ive been stuck. yes i fucking expected this to happen, yes i've experienced worse, ya, i knew something like this was coming but that doesnt make it feel any better. i dont understand how people can be so Goddamn insensitive and then laugh about it like their words are funny. and i dont understand why this has to happen, or why its happening to me and especially to laura. i just don't understand. all i do is fucking analyze and i simply, dont understand. 

I feel like my head is going to explode. and i feel like i have to put on a show, to just remain indifferent. i wish i could, i wish i didn't care about people, or what happens to them, or what they say or what they think. And i wish i could fucking do myself justice with my words. i can't ever seem to say what i'm feeling anymore and for the first time in as long as i can remember i want people to know. i dont have enough space in my body to harbor all of these emotions, good and bad alike. Sometimes i think i'm just not meant to be here, that i'm not cut out for this. that i can't do it anymore. and Lord how  fucking melodramatic do i sound?"

"event","This inexplicable sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach seems to be quite comfortable inside of me today. I've been on the verge of tears since i woke up. is it because of Chris? Because of Elliott? Or maybe my God forsaken hormones. It seems to be the latter, which in turn amplifies every shitty aspect of my life. 

The ability to trust has left me, but I'm wondering if that's even such a bad thing as of late. I trusted too quickly and without caution in the past and look what happened. One person in a gutter somewhere breaking my heart and the heart of someone else i love more than anyone else on the planet. Another looking like a fucking idiot, making me regret once more the day i ever laid my eyes on him. 

I don't mean to sound like life is terrible though, I've had fun the past couple of days, and done things i'm not used to. And if all else fails, Burning Man is hardly three weeks away. Nothing can really seem that bad knowing I have a detailed escape plan ready to be put into action so soon."

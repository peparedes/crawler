Happy Fourth Of July!!!
Went to Denver to Tonys other daughter Leslies house.  She has a husband Dewey and four kids...Kim and Stephanie-twins in college.  Abbey and Josh.  They had a block party with 3 or 4 other neighbors.  Everybody grilled out and everyone compiled all their stuff together for one big party.  We had bratwurst on the grill...delicious.  Delisious chocolate truffle for dessert and 4th of july american flag cake.  Dewey drove to Wyoming and got a bunch of fireworks...legal and of the other sort.  lol.  They were very enjoyable to watch.  

Mike decided to accept the Kellam Job in Va Beach.  I am very excited for him and for us.  This is a great experience for him and we will be living closer together.  The plan is for me to move down at the end of the school year.  I think I will really like living at the beach.  

July 5 
Was a relaxing day.  Mikes mom got the news that she didn't in fact break her tailbone...but her ""Sacchram"" (spelling?).  Its the bone right at the base of your back.  Theres nothing she can do but take pain pills, relax as much as possible and deal with the pain.  Mike and I cooked my burrito meal for dinner tonight.  I think we also watched National Treasure with Nicolas Cage tonight.  It was very good.  

July 6
We went to the Royal Gorge in Canon City.  Canon City is about 45 minutes from Pueblo.  You can take this train along the gorge and its right up against the river.  You can see the whitewater rafters and its so pretty.  The mountains on either side of you.  Above you can see the bridge 1,000 feet up in the air.  After the train ride,we rode up to the top of the mountain and looked at the view of the top from the gorge.  After the Royal Gorge we went to Chilis for lunch.

July 7
Today was a relaxing day. We basically just relaxed and prepared to go to Crested Butte.  We went to Walmart and got groceries.  Mikes mom gave me a cute little purse.  I love it."

"event","I am having a great time in Colorado with Mike.  I went down to Greenville on Wednesday and Mike, Eric, and I went to Chicos and later on to Tiebreakers.  Thursday morning we got up early after only a few hours of sleep and Eric took us to the Raleigh Airport.  

We took our first flight to Dallas.  It was a really good flight.  Originally, Mike and I were not suppose to have seats together on the flight but the check in person switched our seats and gave us an exit row.  I like the exit row because there is a lot more room.  We got to Dallas and had about an hour and fifteen minutes until our flight in Denver.  We had to take the skylink to another terminal and that thing was quite an adventure.  They don't put anything on the skylink to hold on to and it moves very quickly.  I felt like I was surfing.  I was holding on to Mike but he wasn't holding on to anything.  When we got to our next terminal we decided to get something to eat.  We didn't realize how little time we had.  We got back to our gate just in time for final bording.  The next flight was not as good as the first one.  It was hotter.  It was only half the time though so that was good.  We arrive to Denver airport and Mikes brother John picked us up.  We drove from the Denver airport to Pueblo which is about a 2 hour ride.  However we hit some traffic going into Colorado Springs which is inbetween Denver and Pueblo.  When we got to Colorado Springs John took us on a tour of the radio station he works at.  He is a DJ there.  It was a pretty cool place.  I have always been fascinated by radio stations and radio programs.  I don't really know why.  On the way from Co Springs to Pueblo John took the back way through the Garden Of The Gods.  It was absolutely beautiful. We are going back there.  

We got to Mikes Moms house around 7:30.  I met Mikes mom, her husband Tony, the two cats-Smokey, Cindy and the dog Casey....who is MALE!!!  LOL.  The house is very cool its like 5 split levels. I have my own room and my own bathroom. Mike is sleeping downstairs in another bedroom.  Mikes mom made spaghetti for dinner.  It was delicious.  We were both tired and didn't feel like doing much so we just played some pool and watched the Vegas Video.  

On Friday we were suppose to sleep in but Mike got up at 6am when he got a phone call from Kellum High School in Va Beach.  The principal left him a message wanting to know if he was still interested in the job.  Mike came in and woke me up at like 7:30 to tell me the good news.  We ate some waffles and then went back to sleep for awhile.  Mike talked to the principal and he told him that HR would be calling him.  We got dressed, went and picked up Casey from Tonys shop.  Casey had gone to the groomers.  Tony owns his own business and deals in cutlery.  Its a pretty cool place.  He had some cool artwork on the walls done by his son in law.  That night, Mike, Me, Tony, and his mom went to this concert in Pueblo of the Pueblo Symphony playing Big Band Music.  It was comparable to Sunday in The Parks in Greenville except for they have lots of food stands and drink stands.  It was an enjoyable evening.  Afterwards we went to Cracker Barrel for dinner and got a free meal because of how long it took them to bring our food...45 minutes and blamed on a poched egg....lol.

Saturday Mikes mom and I went and got our nails done.  It was fun.  I got mine painted an OPI color...Mothers Road Rose.  AFterwards we went shopping in downtown Pueblo.  Cute little town.  Unique stores like in Beaufort, or Old Towne.  We went and had lunch also.  Later that afternoon we all went to the Reservoir in Pueblo.  Down by the water it was soooooooo hot.  After the Reservoir we went UP to Liberty Point in Pueblo.  An amazing difference in climate.  Very pretty views.  Everywhere you look off into the distance...north, south, east, or west...you see mountains in Colorado.  Later that night for dinner Mikes mom made Filet Mignon and Baked Potatos.  It was yummy.  We watched Hostage with Bruce Willis which is a very intense movie.

Sunday was a relaxing day.  We had Bacon and French Toast for Breakfast and went over to Tonys daughters house...Lori and Jim have two kids Wyeth and Summerset (spelling?).  They are very nice.  Jim is a teach and artist and I think Loris pains as well.  The kids are really sweet.  We had Pikes Peaks Bars which are vanilla ice cream with a chocalate covering on a stick.  Later we grilled out..ribs.  Another Yummy meal.  We ended the evening with playing Texas Hold Em.  

Mikes Mom and Tony have a pool table so Mike and I have been spending a lot of time playing pool.  I am actually getting A LOT Better.  I have learned how to hold the stick better and I am actually trying to think about what ball I should hit and how I should hit it...so my odds for getting a ball in are increasing.  I have always love playing pool and now that I'm winning more it makes it even more fun."

"event","Well, I'm back to my normal routine this week, its really hard getting back into the swing of things.  The motivation is just not there right now.  I so have spring fever.  I don't feel like doing anything that has to be done.  I guess its because Spring Break was so much fun that I just feel like I want to keep having fun.  

I went to NC for the entire break to visit Mike.  I had a really good time.  I left on Thursday before Easter.  Thursday night when I arrived about 2 hours after I was suppose to Mike and I went to dinner with Brandy and Eric at O'Charley's and then we played Texas hold em.

On Friday, Mike had a workday so we went to school for awhile and then that night we went to Marathon.  The greek restaraunt across the street from Hams.  Mike tried to get me to eat Greek food but I didn't want to--so i got their steak sub which was delicious.  Then we took a walk around campus.  ECU is becoming a really nice looking campus.  The science building is beautiful and the new dining hall is very nice as well.  They even have a subway in it.  When we walked around campus we had fun making percussive noises at Joyner library.  We also drove by the baseball stadium a few times.  What a unique thing to do.  LOL.  

Saturday we slept in really late which was nice and then we went to the waterfront to visit our boats in Washington which is this town about 30 miles or so from Greenville.  They have the NC Estuarium which is a bird museum that tells the weather to WITN. LOL.  The waterfront was pretty and they have a nice boardwalk that walks along the river.  Saturday night we went to Cafe Caribe.  It wasn't that crowded, I guess because it was the night before Easter.

Sunday, Mike & I went to Oakmont Baptist for Easter Church.  I enjoyed the service.  It is really different from a Catholic Mass.  The beginning is similar with all the readings, and opening hymns, and they do a collection.  I guess the main difference was they did a drama and they didn't do communion.  Got to see Kim and Jason at the service.  Kim set with us and afterwards we got to go to the nursery and see Elijah.  He is adorable (but not as cute as Sydney, lol).  

After Church we headed for Charlotte to visit with Mikes brother Dave and his wife Tara, and daughter Sydney, and their dog The Hulk.  On our way to Charlotte I had a new adventure.  We stopped to eat in Zebulon at Smithfields BBQ.  I had BBQ for the first time.  I got the sandwich without coleslaw.  I enjoyed it although it was a little messy.  I would get it again.  Its the type of food that I like but wouldn't seek out.  I'm glad I tried it.  We got to Charlotte about 5:00.  Sydney is soooo cute and sweet.  She has the most adorable personality.  My favorite thing is when she laughs she scrunches up her nose.  Monday night Tara cooked a very good dinner.  For an appetizer we had this spicy chicken roll or wrap.  It was a rice wrap with lettuce, onion, and spicy chicken in it. A vietamese food i think.  It was very good and you dip it in red chili sauce.  For the main course we had chicken pot pie which I want to try to make because it was really good.  Tuesday morning Tara and Dave both had to work so Mike and I babysat Sydney.  The trip to Charlotte was a lot of fun.  Afterwards Mike and I headed for the beach.  

We left for the beach about 1:30 and it  took forever to get there.  We hit traffic and it was a long car ride.  But we finally got to Morehead City around 10:00.  We stopped at the Walmart to get groceries and a few other things for the condo.  At the checkout we had a super dumb cash register girl that made these throat noises.  She couldn't get my license # to register in the computer so the check that I wrote wouldn't go through.  There shouldn't have been any issues.  But oh well....I thought it was funny though...poor Mike all he wanted to do was get to the condo b/c he was tired of driving and then I held us up at the cash register.  I was that person in the line holding everyone up!  LOL.  But it WASN'T my fault!  We got to the condo around 11:15.  We took all the stuff upstairs.  Mike carried my suitcase upstairs which was really sweet, because it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo heavy!  I really hadn't been looking forward to carrying that up.  When everything was said and done it was midnight before we were ready to sit down and relax and watch a DVD...but oh no...no no....of course...the controls don't work, so we weren't able to watch one.  After having a couple of beers we went to sleep because we were so exhausted.  

Oh yeah, I forgot...when we stopped at the mall I bought a Tennessee coozie.  LOL.  Thats a first...buying something sports related.

Wednesday at the beach we slept in kind of late to catch up on some needed sleep.  We ended up taking a walk on the beach and putting our feet in the FREEZING COLD WATER. That only feels comfortable after your feet go numb.  After we walked along the beach we got dressed and ran some errands.  We went to the very important ABC store and got our ""supplies"".  After that we went to the Walmart to get the DVD remote for the playstation.  We also went to Foodlion to get a few more things for food.  When we got back to the condo I cooked my burrito meal.  It turned out well.  We watched American Idol and saw Jessica get voted off which I don't feel like it was her time to go.  After that we started making drinks.  Wednesday night was Banana Rum and coke night.  I also made some fun at the beach drinks but they were really strong and i think its because i was missing the pineapple juice.  We also watched Thirteen Days the movie about JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  I really enjoyed that movie.  Later that night we took advantage of the hot tub with the green water.

Thursday I made bacon and eggs for breakfast and then we went and sat out on the beach for a couple of hours.  I got really sunburned on my legs because for some reason my logic was to put sunblock on my arms but not my legs.  lol.  We walked into the water a little bit and then something funny happened while we were in the water.  Mike all the sudden says ooh, gross, by your foot...so I'm thinking OMG what the hell is by my foot I need to get away from it so I start running away from whatever it is and in the process got Mikes shorts all wet.  LOL. Later on that day we went to Beaufort and walked around.  We went in a couple of stores.  We then were going to go to the Sanitary but as we got there three busses had just gotten there so we decided to hold off until Friday.  So we went back to the condo and had Digiorno Pizza and leftover Burritos for dinner.  We then drank some beer and watched Master In Commander.  Which I have seen before I just can't remember where. 

Friday we woke up and found out that the Pope was about to die.  Then we found out from Fox News that he was dead, and then we found out that He was alive.  LOL.  Friday we sat out on the beach for awhile, got dressed and went to the Sanitary for dinner.  I enjoyed it, I got chopped steak and their stuffed baked potato.  Later on that night we went to the movies and we saw Guess Who which is pretty good.  I enjoyed it.  Then we came back to the condo and made daiqueris.  We bought this Strawberry daiqueri mix and put in it some of the different liquors that we had.  THey were really good, and we watched Old School.    
Okay, more later...."

Tonight I'm trying to clean my room, do some progress reports, try to organize myself for the week, and do a MASSIVE amount of laundry.  Its a slow process.  See, im even writing in my live journal to procrastinate.  

I did do some arts and crafts today, lol.  And I'm very proud of my creation.  I did decapouge (spelling?) . I took some Kim Anderson pictures from my day by day calendar and put them on a cardboard box (like a pencil box), decorating the entire thing with it.  It looks really cool.  So now I have a new crafty hobby.  

Well, i'm off to do stuff that needs to be done."

Long story short...Dell apparently needs to verify more information on my preferred account because I haven't used the account in awhile.

"event","Today was a fun day.  I woke up about 9:15.  I got dressed and went to the Christmas Party for my Tuesday School.  I had to take a gift.  I was running late so I ran into Starbucks and got this set of 4 different types of coffee.  The party was nice.  It was at this restaraunt called Pulcinella's and they pre-selected what we would eat.  I was kind of disappointed about that because I wanted to get Chicken Parmesan.  But I can't complain since I didn't have to pay.  For appetizers there was Bruschetta, fried zucchini and some other stuff.  I tried the zucchini, it actually wasn't that bad.  I really like the bruschetta.  I had 3 glasses of wine.  :)  .  Then they brought salad, bread.  The main course was antipasta, and then you could have either salmon or this chicken.  I of course got the chicken because I don't eat seafood.  It was pretty good.

The best part about the party was the gift exchange.  Everyone puts their gift on a table and then you draw a number.  You pick your gift when it is your turn.  When its your turn you can either pick a gift off the table or ""steal"" someone elses gift if you really want that.  Okay, first of all....I have decided that all the teachers at this school must like to drink because I would say about a 1/3 of the gifts were bottles of wine or champagne.  LOL.  there was even a 12 pack of Corona as a gift.  LOL.  At first I thought about stealing the 12 pack because that would be such the ""Gina"" thing to do.  But then I thought about it and was like, I always buy beer.  I'm going to get a bottle of wine.  So when it was my turn I went up to the table and picked the gift that was obviously a bottle of wine.  It was cool, except for it was red wine, and I prefer white.  The person put with it wine charms which you put on your bottles/glasses to be able to distinguish them.  I thought it was cute.  Well, then towards the end someone stole my gift!  I was so mad...but thats okay, cause then I went and stole someone elses bottle of wine.  So I ended up with the Kendall Jackson Chardonnay which I know I like because I had it at the Chop House at Convention.  So yaa for owning a bottle of wine!

Came home after the party took about a 2 hour nap and then I went to the mall and bought some eyeliner and then my mom and I went to Bennigans and got baked potato soup.  My mom was melodramatic at the mall.  She got a cramp in her leg and had to like get out of the car at the mall and walk around the parking lot, of course she could have won an oscar for her performance.  LOL, but she is okay now.  

Now I'm going to straighten up a little bit, do some work for school and get ready for tomorrow.  I took a temp job.  UGH...But its only 8-3..but I have to leave at 6...but I will make some money...tomorrow night is the Messiah Sing-a-long at the Kennedy Center.  Excited about that.  We are all going to dinner before hand at the Carlyle Grande...Its a nice restaraunt, not my favorite because they don't have too much selection on the menu that I like, but of course I will be able to find something.

Taa for now."

Anyways, just got back from Greenville today.  I'm pretty tired, actually I'm cold right now, hold on going to get a sweater.  BRB.  Okay, back.
  
I had a lot of fun this weekend.  Watched the redskins actually win a game, tried to play pool.  :)  .  I really suck at pool.  Sometimes I get lucky and I do okay..but thats just it, its luck...i have no strategy or plan when I go to hit the ball, so most the time if i actually hit any balls they just end up dancing around the table.
I saw three movies this weekend...well, 2 I slept through most of one.  LOL...Elf, Oceans 12, and Terminal.  My favorite one was The Terminal.  Tom Hanks is such a good actor.  I always enjoy watching anything he is in. 
 
Mike and I went to Emerald Isle for a night and stayed at Annies condo.  It was so desolate at the beach!  We had to drive all the way into Morehead City to get coke at 11:30 at night because everything on the island was closed.  The condo is really nice.  I hope we are able to use it again Spring Break.  It has a jacuzzi tub which was cool except for green water and the nasty residue the water left behind.  LOL. 
It snowed a little at the beach and Greenville got a few inches.  It was sooooooooooooooooooooooo cold Sunday and Monday!  It was neat seeing snow at the beach.  Thats definitely something I had never seen before.  
Like always, I always am a little sad to return home to Maryland.  But I am going back down in less than a week to go to Atlanta and then to G-ville to see Mike so I am looking forward to that.

Concert went well today.  The kids played really well.  Found out today that my two trumpets that are in Advanced Band are both moving.  One is not coming back after Christmas and the other doesn't know when she is going to be leaving.  I hoping she doesn't until after festival.  If not then I have NO trumpets for this band for festival.  I might have to get one of my trumpets from another school to play with them.  Its really hard to find a piece at their grade level where the trumpets don't have the melody.  This school is right next to Quantico so thats why we get kids that move in the middle of the year sometimes.  I got lots of Christmas presents today.  That was pretty cool.  

Tomorrow I am going to a Christmas luncheon at Pulcinellas in McLean for my Tuesday schools christmas party. Should be nice.  I want to go, but on the other hand I have a lot of stuff I want to get done at home and this is going to take up my whole day.  But oh well, it will be nice.  Well, not really my whole day.  Its from 12:30-2:00.  But that means I need to leave my house at 11:30...BUT i need to get a gift before I go so I need to go to the mall to pick up something, so I will actually need to leave at 11:00, which means I need to start getting ready by 10:00 so I should get up by 9:30.  Thats not too bad.  I need to finish some Christmas cards though.  I have like 4 or 5 left to do that I haven't mailed yet.  They should go in the mail tomorrow, or they really won't make it by Christmas.  

Okay, thats all for now.  :)"

"event","Wednesday-Had my teacher meeting and then lunch afterwards at Generous Georges.  Food was great.  I was so stuffed though.  I had 3 slices of pizza.  And Generous George is very generous with his portions and the pizza slices are huge.  Meeting went well also.  Afterwards went back to BI and got some music out of the library.  I think I have exhausted that library.  I am definitely going to have to order some music.  I know there are some pieces that I still haven't used in there that are good....but the other teachers still have them out.  They keep them and never check them in.  I'm going to look to see what they have and if I want it, ask if I can borrow it.  
Then I went to my Wed. school to teach a bass clarinet lesson.  That went well.  Her audition piece is the bass clarinet part to Holst First Suite.  Pretty easy except for a couple of runs.  I have to admit...I would like to have a few more private students.  It was nice at the end of the lesson getting $20.  That was my going out money that night!  I also met 3 of the new jr.high teachers when I was at the school.  They all seem really nice and there is a cute guy!  Yaa!  I also found out that 2 of my worst discipline kids are leaving the school!  Yaa...that will make such a huge difference in afterschool band.  I was excited that the principal when she introduced me to the new teachers was like ""this is our amazing band director...""then she confessed that the day she first met me she was afraid the kids were going to eat me alive and how I quickly proved her wrong.  I could tell when she first met me that she was skeptical...I mean wouldn't you be unsure of a first year teacher?  I would.  
Wednesday night I went to Glory Days with MB, Katie, Hickey, Bill, and Jen.  We gave Bill his gift cert.  He appreciated it. (By the way another big meal)Afterwards me, Katie, and MB stopped off at Eric S. house to say goodbye to him before he leaves for college.  Eric was in SITR.  Hes going to Baltimore to Maryland Institute of College And Art.  Then we went to Silver Diner for some girl time.  We had milkshakes.  I got the Chunky Monkey Banana Milkshake. YUMMY!  It was soooo good.  I was soooo full by the time I was in the car from eating soooooooo much that day and then topping it off with the milkshake.  All the way home I really had to concentrate on not throwing up.  It was the most uncomfortable feeling I have ever had.  So overall this was a very good day.  Very full day as well.  Up at 6 went to bed at 1.  Okay, I will talk about Thursday later.  Cause I want to take a break."

okay, i am also reading this book...Music Teaching Style.  Dr. Whaley gave it to me last year.  I just finsihed reading the chapter Positive Learning Environment and found a paragraph that I thought about sending to Jess to read...maybe it will teach her a thing or two about dealing with kids...

""There is a tradition in some schools to give an award for teacher of the year, with the winner announced at a public assembly or ceremony.  One such ceremony had honor students select and announce the winner.  Along with the anouncement, the students gave a list of the qualifications used to make their selection.  The winner was patient with students, pleasant to work with, listened closely to hear what they had to say, took time to help even when the teacher was busy, had a sense of humor, and cared that they learned.  Coincidentally, these qualities make up the next dimension, Positive Learning Environment."""

"event","I couldn't roll out of bed this morning so I ended up leaving at 7:30 instead of 7:15 for work.  Not really a big deal.  Depending on traffic I could get there on time, but I would probably be 5-10 minutes late.  Not a big deal.  Well, someone decided to have an accident on the Wilson Bridge this morning.  I didn't get to work until 10:00.  I'm suppose to be here at 8:30.  2 hours and 45 minutes. it took me to get to work.  Geez.  The place where the accident happened is such a dangerous spot.  For some reason traffic always slows down in that one spot and it can jump on you all of the sudden.   If you aren't paying attention your not going to be able to stop in time.  There have been a few times when I have zoned out and had to stop short there and have almost gotten in an accident.  Now I always try to be more alert in that area.

I'm excited...tomorrow is my teachers meeting and I get a free lunch from Music And Arts Center.  I wouldn't mind going to Generous Georges Pizza but it would be nice to get a more expensive meal out of them.  Not Ramparts though like 2 years ago.  I'm actually in the mood for Pizza so I guess GG will be ok.  Then Im going to pick out music in the music library at BI for the school year, i'm going to order a few new pieces.  Just don't know what yet.  Then I think i'm teaching a private lesson if we can work out logistics.  

Then the most exciting part is having dinner with Katie, Marybeth, Bill, Brian (and Jen grudingly).  We are going to give Bill his gift cert. to Carlyle Grand, his fave restaraunt.  We are goign to have dinner at Glory Days.  This will be our final last outing (except for lunch on Thurs with K & MB) before Katie, MB, and Brian leave.  

I've decided that Jess has a powertrip problem.  I don't like her attitude of superiority she thinks you have because you are a teacher or an adult.  (I don't mean superiority in the classroom....I mean in life in general).  If she only knew how many people were annoyed by her whatever you call it.  Not just me and my friends...but peoples parents as well...she gets lots of eye rolls."

I should have never gone tonight.  Actually I'm glad I did.  It allowed me to hear all the shit they have been talking about all summer.  It was ok when we weren't talking summer theater, but when we got on that subject...they had completely different twisted ideas of how things went down.  And they started bashing Marybeth and sorta Mike T.  I mean, Hello!  They are my friends...and I'm sitting right  here.

Jess and Bill going on a date tomorrow night.  Interesting!  On one hand I want it to go well because I think they both just need to fuck to be in a better mood. On the other hand...I don't want it to go well b/c I don't want jess influencing Bill.  

I'm tired.  Good night.

I wish I could go back to college, life was so simple back then.
What would I give to go back and live in a dorm with a meal plan again!
I wish I could go back to college.  In college you know who you are.  You sit in the quad, and think, ""oh my god!  I am totally gonna go far!""
How do I go back to college?  I don't know who I am anymore!
I wanna go back to my room and find a message in dry-erase pen on the door!
I wish I could just drop a class...
Or get into a play...
Or change my major....
Or fuck my T.A.
I need an academic advisor to point the way! We could be...
Sitting in the computer lab, 4am before the final paper is due, cursing the world cause I didn't start sooner, and seeing the rest of the class there, too!
I wish I could go back to college!
How do I go back to college?!

But if I were to go back to college, think what a loser I'd be, I 'd walk through the quad, and think ""oh my god...these kids are so much younger than me."""

"event","Yaa for getting a lot of work done today.  I did my band handbook.  I still need to proof it and make one appropriate for each school.  They are all basically the same with a couple modifications here and there.  But the main part is done.  

I also helped Mike find maid services for g-ville.  Since the fam with the baby is coming into town.  Too bad he can't use the services b/c he doesn't have time.  They need to come out and do an estimate first before they come to clean your house.

I thought I would be exhausted at work today but I have done really well.  Its cause I kept myself busy.  Doesn't mean I won't be exhausted driving home or take a nap when I go home.  

I talked to my friend Ted from high school today online.  Hes getting married in Oct!  crazy!  But we are going to get together hopefully with his fiance, Brendan, and Tony and have some drinks soon to catch up. 

Jake the lead is down at JMUs Marching Band camp and he made 1st trumpet.  Thats awesome, but really is it unexpected since he wins everything he does and apparently he tried on purpose to mess up because he didn't want to be on 1st.  He put down he wanted to be on 3rd.  This is his freshmen year so hes never marched before (cause     he went to BI) so its all new to him but he says he really likes it.  I'm sure hes picking it up really well...probably already 10 times better than I was at marching band.

"event","I had the best sandwich at Panera Bread today.
Anyone who knows me knows that I am a picky eater.
Usually when I go to Panera I get the 1/2 salad, soup combo...Chicken Caesar Salad and French Onion Soup.  Today I decided to be different, I wanted to get a turkey sandwich that included cheese, bacon, lettuce.
They had this panini sandwich but the only problem was the sundried tomato ale mustard.  I asked if I could get it without but they said I couldn't cause the mustard stuff is already mixed in.
So I said well is it possible to get turkey, bacon, lettuce, and cheese on bread...(all their sandwiches are fancy and have fancy stuff on them).  The lady suggested I get the Smoked Turkey Bravo.  
Smoked Turkey Bravo includes:
Tomato Basis bread
Smoked Turkey
Bacon
Smoked Gouda
Lettuce
Tomato 
Some dressing

My Smoked Turkey Bravo included
Asiago Cheese Bread
Smoked Turkey
Bacon
Swiss 
Lettuce
No Tomato
No dressing

And it was soooooooooooooooooo good."

"event","Dr.W gave us teachers ""homework"". 
Over the summer Dr. W sent me a book that his publishing company had just published...""Music Teaching Style"".  He put a note with it...I thought you might enjoy some summer reading.  I thought that was very nice of him.  Over the summer I actually did read 8 of the chapters.  At our inservice meeting in the fall he had photocopied the music teaching style survey and passed it out to all of us.  I remember him saying that we should do it.  However I don't remember him saying that we would go over them at the end of the year when we sign our contracts.  So now I have to do this survey.  Not a big deal, but since we are going to go over our responses with him I figure I need to be pretty thorough and be able to back up my answers, etc.
The second assignment...was for the Honor Band Combined concert with the Wind Ensemble and concert band.  Rich is going to announce for the BI Bands and for the Honor Band this year so I need to write him program notes by next week for my song.  I'm glad hes talking cause I hate getting up at that concert and talking before I conduct.
I got everything done tonight that I needed to for school tomorrow.  Yaa me, 2 days in a row."

I am so sick of Debbie and Mom talking during the shows so you can't hear the dialogue.  I'm sorry...maybe I'm being anal or ridiculous about it...but that is my perogative.  When I watch a show I like to hear the dialog because I am afraid I am going to miss something.  Does that mean you can't open your mouth during the show....NO!  You can talk...but only in between dialog.  You should be conscientious of when people are talking and stop midsentence if you need to.  I guess from now on I will just watch the shows by myself.

I really think its because all the young ones still in high school...John, Jasmine, and Diana probably have their whole school calling up and voting for them to win and all of the students are probably calling 100 times each or something and thats what is building up their volume of votes.

I was in complete shock tonight.  However, one thing to be grateful for is that it wasn't Fantasia.  I think I would have boycotted Idol for the rest of the season if Fantasia wasn't on there anymore."

"event","Well, I am down here in Charlotte for my spring break visiting with Audrey and Brandy.  So far the trip is great.  I feel much better all though I still have a runny nose and I cough at times.  I got here Wednesday...carried all my stuff up to Audreys apartment.  Eric and Brandy were already here, Mike L. arrived shortly after and we all went to Hops for dinner.

At Hops I got a cosmopolitan and an appletini only 2.50 per drink.  That is a pretty good deal.  I wasn't that hungry so I got soup and salad...caesar and baked potato soup.  After dinner we went to Audrey's UNCC rehearsal.  It was kind of funny all of us ECU people up in that rehearsal.  Dr. Marks really dotes on ECU.  He makes ECU sound like the Julliard of NC.  I got to see Chris Willis.  I was soooooooo excited.  I had not seen him in 4 1/2 years!  Eric played tromobone during rehearsal and I played clarinet.  I sat back with the thirds.  I did pretty good.  Technically I could play almost all of the music.  My tone and embouchure definitely were not good.  But I made it through the whole rehearsal without my ""mouth falling off"".  LOL.  After reherasal we went to this bar called Tipsys with Scott M., Dr. M. and Ashley the music rep.  We had a couple of beers where Audrey came to the awful realization that the UNCC concert is on a Friday night...the friday night that she is going to be in Georgia with her kids for their trip.  Now Dr. M is trying to find cheap plane tickets for her to fly back and forth for herself so she can play the concert.  After Tipsys we went to Jillians for 30 minutes because they closed at midnight but Mike and Eric really wanted to go play some games so we went and had a beer and played some games.  Came back to Audreys drank and watched TV, played Trivial Pursuit...Mike kicked our asses and got 4 pies!  He really answered like 10 questions in a row correct.

We went to bed about"

"event","So I have this cold.  I don't think its that bad.  The past couple days I felt the onset of a sore throat and all last night I kept waking up and it was a pain to swallow.  But once I woke up and rehydrated my throat I felt much better.  Now I just have the groggy feeling, the occassional cough and the runny nose thing.  So I'm curing this with chicken soup, gingerale, orange juice, and plenty of rest.
I should feel better by tomorrow.  I don't feel that sick as it is.  Whenever the weather changes from one extreme to the other this always happens.  Its freaking freezing outside and its April 12.  Pouring down rain.  

I spent 5 hours at the windshield place today.  I got there at 7:50am and didn't leave until 1:00.  It should have only taken like an hour but they needed the molding and they had to drive all over Maryland trying to find it.  Oh well, its fixed, and I didn't have to pay for it so can't complain.  Now I need to just go get it signed off from an authorized inspection mechanic or from a police officer and mail it in and my duty is done."

"event","Talk about getting a wrench thrown in things.
Thursday night driving to Kates Irish Pub to meet Nick and Bill.  I'm listening to AIDA, I get to the fast part and I get pulled over.  Im going 65 in a 45.  Cop doesn't give me a speeding ticket but mandates that I get my cracked windshield fixed within 10 days or else my registration will be suspended.  Thats $100 but...my moms friend is getting it done for me for free
Friday I go to the DMV to pay some fines for lapse of Insurance for 1 week back in Jan 03 because I paid my insurance late and I didn't realize it had cancelled.  The fine for both cars totaled $362.70.  I had to pay the fines because I need to renew my tags (I'm lucky the cop didn't catch that because they expired 3/31).  Well, on the phone they told me I could make payment arrangements but when I got there after waiting an hour to pay a partial payment they informed me that because the fine is under $200 on each car I can't make arrangements.  After explaining I couldn't pay the full amount and I had to renew my tags she said I could pay $200 and pay the rest at the end of the month when I get paid.  (I was only planning to pay $75)  Then I had to wait for 2 hours after that to renew my tags....NOBODY BOTHERED TO TELL ME IT COST $81 to renew tags for 2 years.  I thought it would be like $20 or something.  I had no idea it was that expensive.  So I walked out of the DMV after three hours and spent $180 more than I had intended.  I think I have a phobia about the DMV now.  I swear ever since I went to go get my license in high school everytime I go to the DMV something goes wrong.  When I went to go take my driving test in high school I had to go get the front light fixed before they would let me take my test.
So then on Saturday I went to go get my taxes done.  That turned out a little better.  I still owe MD again but not as much as last year.  But since I haven't finished paying them from last year I got to finish paying both years.  I have to pay MD $175 for this year and I still owe them $200 from last year.  I have to pay NC $7 because even though I only work down there for one week they still take out state taxes on me.  My federal I'm getting back around $700.  That will be nice.  Although I'm going to pay off some debt with it.  I may use some of it to buy some summer clothes or a digital camera.  It sucks because every year I'm getting back less and less money on my federal.  They say cause I'm making more money....Its because of my temp jobs in the summer.  But I guess I would rather have the extra money in the summer time.
Oh, and I had to pay $80 to get my taxes done.  So now I have way less money than I'm suppose to have.  Luckily I will get my tax money in 2 weeks.  Charlotte will be a little tight but I will manage. 
Tomorrow I'm going to get my windshield fixed and to the laundromat.  Now all I have to figure out is how we are going to swing the cable bill.  We owe like 5 months.  LOL.  
I can't wait till Wednesday so I can put all the yucky stuff out of my mind for a few days."

"event","Yaa!  Amanda isn't going to be the director this summer for the musical.  Mike said yes.  So now everyone will be happy...or at least start out happy.  Also, we are going to have the musical at BI instead of St. B's so we will have a real auditorium with a real stage with a real place to put the pit orchestra.  Yaa.
Now all that has to be decided is the musical.  I really wanted to do Fiddler.  But Mike doesn't want to do that.  Plus, we don't have many strong guys to do the guy rolls.  Other possibilities that have been thrown out are Hello Dolly, Singin In The Rain, Man Of La Mancha.  The only one of those that I know is Hello Dolly because I stage managed it my senior year.  I was looking on mtishows website and Singin In the Rain looked like it would be a cool one...it has a large orchestra so that would be really cool for me.  I don't want to do a show that uses only like guitar and keyboard and set because that wouldn't be as fun for be to do.  I hope Bill decides all the logistics soon.  I hate the suspense of not knowing.
But what a relief to know that the crazy Bi#%@ isn't coming back...at least as a director...that means all the good students will come back as well."

"event","Was the opening weekend of Godspell.  I went to it on Saturday night.  OMG.  It was unbelievable.  First of all the auditorium was packed....428 people.  Godspell is such a fun musical and the students totally portrayed that in their acting.  I was so proud of them.  Jake did a wonderful job as Judas/John The Baptist.  His singing, charcacter, and different voices throughout the show were the best.  I can't believe he never did any other musicals before now.  Too bad he is a senior.  There was not one bad actor/actress in the production.  Mary sang the Turn Back Oh Man song and Kristen did the Oh Bless The Lord and the high note on We Beseech Thee.  Casey did We Beseech Thee and Beth of course was perfect for By My Side.  They did so well.  The music was great and the lights were very effective.  I was also very impressed with Matt (he is a piano prosepect for the summer) and Emily did well too.  The director added this song, ""We can build a beautiful city...."" during the last supper part.  Apparently it is from the movie.  I thought it really added a nice touch to the show.  Especially since the basis for Godspell is building a community throughout the show.  I also am glad they did the prologue in the beginning because it makes the rest of the show make a little more sense.  
After the show, Bill, Kiffolo, Kevin,Jess, and Kevins son Raymond and I went to TGIFRIDAYS.  It was fun.  The joke of the evening was Raymond getting served about 20 lemons with his water.  He likes lemon."

"event","So the past 4 weekends I have spent at Bishop Ireton.  
Weekend #1:
Was the Band Festival.  The Band Festival went really well.  My bands all got Superiors.  Which I was completely shocked about.  I mean, I had a feeling a couple of my bands would probably get a superior.  But the rest of them I was so concerned about because they would make such stupid mistakes in the rehearsals.  But they all were really focused and played really well at the Band Festival.  
The judges had really good comments for my bands.  I was really proud of the fact that I got no comments about percussion being too loud.  Which is usually my comments but this year we really focused on the balance between band and percussion and it definitely payed off.  The other thing that my bands has really improved on is playing their notes for full value (ex:  not making a quarter note an eighth note with an eighth rest after it.)  Last year one of the judges had commented on that with some of my bands so we have been really working on that as well since last year and this year we got complements on our tone quality and how we play through the notes so that was awesome.
The main things the judges said to improve upon were using MORE DYNAMICS and build up the low winds section at most of my schools.  So I need to work on that.  The dynamics thing is so hard because you have such a wide range of players.  Most 6th-8th graders can do dynamics but the 5th graders in the band are having a hard enough time playing the music with the correct notes and rhythms that they don't have time to think about dynamics.  So this is something we need to work on. 
After the band festival (I was there from 7:30am until 5:00pm) I stayed and went to church at Blessed Sacrament with Bill, Leo, and this stage crew girl Annalese.  After church we went back to Ireton and stage crew had a session to put up the set for Godspell.  They also had a lock in so they could get up early on Sunday and finish putting the set up for the show.  So I of course had volunteered to go to the lockin.  I was so exhausted but I stayed.  I fell right asleep though when it was time for bed around 2am.  I left Ireton at around 11am on Sunday."

The only thing I did was download some songs and then I did go see Godspell and then to TGIFridays last night.  Godspell was great and Fridays was fun.  Then today I went to Church and then after that napped and just watched TV all day.  Perhaps that is why I am writing in my journal.  Because I don't feel like finishing cleaning my room or doing some of the school work that I need to do.  So I procrastinate by writing in the journal I never write in.  Oh well...off to figure out what to do now.  Maybe I will try to keep writing in the journal this time.

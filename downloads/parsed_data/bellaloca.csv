"event","To Disneyland (again!)
To an Adventure in California (or California Adventure)
To Diagon Alley
To the closet under the stairs (and more)
To the Gilmore house (both)

We took the girls on vacation for a week to southern California. Not my idea of a vacation initially, but out of a guilty consious (sp?) and maybe subversively selfish we got to have a real adventure!
Aside from Disney's 2 parks, which are fine at this time of year-but so COSTLY, we got in on amazing set tour from Warner Brothers studios.
We wanted to go to the Studio store, I hoping for Everwood or ER paraphenalia, the others just following along. We got lost for 2 hours in a bad section of LA.
So when we finally got to the studio, we were all just happy to be where we had been heading. There was a very nice man behind the counter, I asked him what all this tour involved (at $40 a head). He said the last tour had just left..(insert big whine) not that I really intended on spending $160 on a 2 hour tour.
Back to the nice man behind the counter. We talked about our favorite shows and since we had been on vacation and in the Disney parks til ungodly hours every night we were missing important build ups to the finales...I guess he took a liking to us.
He said if we wanted to sign up for a tour, he would take us himself. A private tour for $160...now we are talking!
So he knows that I am looking for Everwood or ER; Lacey for Gilmore, Smallville, Charmed...we almost anything WB; Chelsi-our resident Harry Potter junkie; Rocky? Old movies are his forte.
One of our first stops (no cameras allowed) The private Warner Brothers museum. An entire floor of Harry Potter sets, costumes, set props and...the swording hat. I proudly am the only Griffendor. We also have 2 Huffelpuffs and to Chelsi's delight or dismay (I'm not sure) she is Slytherin. Yes, we are told it was the real hat.
Some other cool Harry Potter Items (excuse my slight knowledge and or spelling errors I am not a Harry Potter afficianado)The full closet under the stairs, many of Harry's clothing items, the $600,000 vinyl cast of Hermione used during her frozen period, the fireplace that spit all the letters, Harrys Quditch broom, wand, books from sets, many huge gothic creatures and costumes, a HUGE 8 foot hairy tarantula...and so much more.
Very, very cool.
The bottom floor included costumes from WB back to it's roots. Friends, ER, WonderWoman (you can't imagine how SMALL that woman was!)Charmed set props-(the book of shadows included!)btw they too are size -0 and all those boobs are a result of the camera.
I come around the corner to my delight...Dr Andy's clothes, medical bag, and sign from the train depot - 15 mins in and I am in wonderland. Jon Carter's original clothes (including blood) from the first ER episode. much more I can't remember I'm sure.
We are whisked away from there, although I could stay for a long time just surveying all the minute details of every little item.
The rest of the tour which ended up totaling almost 3 hours because we were by ourselves and not on the clock included:
-The Gilmore Girls back sets, both houses. They were in the process of wrapping them up for hiatus. No filming.
The actual Gilmore house, a real house (or two?) the front side is a house from another show, the back side is the Inn...
-The town square where they were taking the tie wrapped leaves off the trees (yes, they film winter in summer and summer in winter, so they have to strip the trees in summer and tie wrap fake leaves on in summer)
-Jake's coffee Shop 
more....
-The new Posiden sets (ALL filmed right in the studios!)
-The ER hospital set (small!) the ambulance bays, ambulances and some minor sets.
-and...The Friends Coffee shop, which because of it's popularity, they have left intact as an archive. Yes, we got to sit on the couch, Lacey got to ""make"" Coffee behind the bar, and sit in the stool where she sang Smelly Cat...lol

Oh and about Diagon Alley? Very cool store in Santa Ana, I can't find the website where I found it again, but I will post it shortly as soon as I do.

Anyhow my point is:
may I say this day was the highlight of vacation. Although they had no Everwood merchandise available to buy.

Picture are up at the family site soon:

"event","So, over a year later, I come back here. Not because I have anything terrbly interesting or witty to prognosticate about, (other than wondering what has happened to Hanson?!?)
but because someone took the initiative to try and revive the AFH community...and I couldn't be happier! I guess just so people know I am still alive.

I have two journals I read regularly, both because I live vicariously through them, and though I have only met one in ""real life"" (and during a time I would never want anyone to know me, please forgive me), I read many others randomly and through links.

About life, me, and other random thoughts: 
This year ( my 41st ) seems to be the year of retrospect that I think most people have at 40..(funny, I never was a late bloomer) 
I've come to terms with some things of late.

-I've done a good job with my kids. I am a great wife and mother. No, I'm not being full of myself. This was proved to me fully and completely this past week and some.
I had a big, bad surgury, -a couple of nights in the hospital, and the past two weeks attempting to recover at home. Let me reiterate; I have been a great wife and mother for the past 20+ years...I know this for a fact because NO ONE can do anything, for themselves, in the house or for me. That's how I know, I have taken such great care of al of them that they are completely and utterly HELPLESS. Or is that called being an enabling control freak. I choose great wife and mother.

-I may never be a published writer..or sappy paperbacks or otherwise.
-I really don't mind not living up to my potential right now. Maybe later.
-I think I am weird because I dont have time for friends outside of work or ....here.

more later.

"event","The Big Dipper is a huge white wooden rollercoaster in my old hometown. That's what my life has felt like these past few days...
Good news and bad, then the good news gives way to reality and reality just has to sink in. It's time for me to be a grown up and stop waiting for all my folly of ice cream dreams to come true. The harsh reality of the situation is, life just isn't about what you want, it about what has to be done. I think.
I wonder, sometimes, if there will ever be a day when I look back and realize that everything I went through being married to this stranger & raising these amazing children, was the pavement on a path to what might turn out to be my dream. Some days I feel so full of dreams and wants and desires for something better, something passionate in my life that I'll burst. Then the light of the next day appears and I see that as long as I make it through the day, that there's food on the table and that my kids are healthy and happy, that it's going to be alright. I don't know what's right to want in life, is it okay to have this grand scheme in your mind or is life all about the day to day?
In the wise words of 3 young men...""I guess we'll never know...just which way the river's going to flow...""

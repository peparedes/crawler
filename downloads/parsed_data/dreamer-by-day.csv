"event","Well, at least that's what it looks like I have done.  But rumor has it that these things only work if you actually use them...

First, I have to say that this is not the first time since May 30 that I have started and entry.  I have started quite a few times, but every time I have just closed it, not wanting to spread my psychosis to my dear friends who read this.  I decided a while ago that I wasn't going to use this medium as just someplace where my friends can read the miserable details of my pathetic little life.  So, I waited until I had something happy to write about.  This hasn't happened in the past three weeks, so I guess this is the best I can do.

I am officially losing my mind.  I have been home for a little over a week now, and still, no love from the wait lists.  I have written letters, prayed, looked for omens, melted down, complained, fretted, obsessed, expalined, cried, attempted strength, and now I am just defeated.  I do not know what to do.  The dean of admissions at Miami has stopped writing me back, I feel like I have done everything I can do for the wait lists I'm on, and it kills me because I know the game is not over yet, and the fat lady hasn't sung, but I get smaller and smaller every day, and with every passing day it gets harder to push it out of my immediate consciousness back to the back of my mind.  It is there, all the time, and there seems to be nothing I can do about it.

But, what if it doesn't work out?  This is even harder than last year.  I was fooled once last year into thinking that the waitlist might actually get to my name, and I went through the range of mourning emotions and reactions, but never got the call.  Shame on them.  But can I be fooled twice?  Shame on me!  I know that that stupid stupid program at Drexel told us that a lot of us would be on waitlists because we wouldn't be interviewing until the spring.  And this rang true for me, but they also claimed that 80% of us would get int somewhere this year?  Where is that 80%, because as far as I can see, its more like 10%.  I spent so much money, so much time, so much energy, and so much emotion over the last year, and I feel like I was lied to flat out.  Drexel wants our money, but what happens to us is not something they care too much about.  Now I don't know what to do for next year again, how familiar.   I hate living from year to year, I hate moving at the end of every year, I hate uncertainty, I hate change, and I hate instability.  Most of all, I hate that I don't feel like I know who I am anymore.

I do not want to apply again next year.  I don't see how applying three years in a row can be good for the cause, and I feel like I am so close to my egotistical breaking point that I will crumble completely if I have to go through another year like this one.  I do not want to go back to Drexel.  I really don't see how this can be productive.  The program is a load of shit, and I have never been so unhappy for so long as I was at Drexel.  I was unable to make any friends, I did not accomplish my goal, I was horribly homesick, and I found myself ultimately dreading going to bed at night, because assuming that I was able to sleep that night (which was rare in and of itself) then I was going to have to get up and do it all over again.  That is not a way to live, and I don't want to do it again.

But it goes deeper.  Do I want to apply ever again?  How many times can I take the same beating before I realize that I am just not going to cut it?  One may say that the next year might be my year, but that can go on for the rest of my life.  Medical school is a big investment of time as well as resources, and I don't want to waste my young years being miserable only to get in when I am 30 and graduate middle aged and spend the rest of my life alone and unfilfilled in my personal life, and competing with people 10 years younger and better in my professional life.

My mom told me the other night that I need to put my pride aside and leave the country.  I do not want to do that.  I have been ashamed of things I have resorted to before for the cause (cough *Drexel* cough).  I in the end, I want to have a degree that I can be proud of, not one that I hope nobody ever asks about.  I already hope that nobody asks about my life, and I am too young for that... but the thought that the rest of my life can go like that is just sickening and maddening.

So beyond what I should do next year, what should I do with my life?  I have no idea.  I really wish I could go back in time and do so many things differently, not take anything for granted.  I should have taken more pictures, been more free with telling people what I think, taken more risks, not been so concerned with what I thought others would thinkg of me.  I have wasted a lot of opportunities, let a lot of advantage go by expected and under appreciated.

So, to summarize, I don't know who I am, what I should be doing short term or long term, and my life is going by unnoticed.

In other news, I need to buy more yarn for my afghan (I have 50 squares Michelle!), my parents are acting like 5 year olds and I am acting like an unlicensed practicing marriage counselor, I still haven't gotten to join a gym because my parents are dragging their heels on this endeavor, it is too hot to run outside normally (although currently it is too thunderstormy) and I am getting out of shape quickly and I am quite upset about it.  That about covers it.

So, if you are content, or maybe even happy, do me a favor, take a look in the mirror and smile, and realize that life is good, or at least okay.

Sorry about this , if you even made it this far, I'll give chipper another college try in the future."

"event","I have to tell you the resolution of the locker story...

So, seeing as the gym refused to tell me when Gary, the man with the key to the manager's office with the bolt cutter, would be in on Saturday, I decided to go in whenever I damn well pleased.  This was at approximately 1:45 in the afternoon.  When I got there the same woman from the night before was working the front desk, and she said that Gary was ""on call"" and in the area, and she would page him.  In the mean time, she encouraged me to go work out.  Since my iPod was stuck in the locker, I ran a very boring half hour in silence.  About 12 minutes in, the woman from the desk said they had to send a consultant over to the other gym to get the bolt cutter.  I guess Gary didn't feel like making an appearance.  The consultant, and the bolt cutter, would be back at about 2:30.  So, I finished my run, and pretty much as soon as I got off the treadmill, I saw the woman with the bolt cutter.

Now, this mo fo was HUGE, like if you placed the tip on the floor, it was as tall as my hip.  We take it into the locker room, and the woman puts it on the lock and squeezes... and nothing...  well not nothing, my lock chewed on this one a bit too.  The woman said that we were going to have to bring in one of the large male trainers to work on it.  At this suggestion, a naked woman (post shower) got all distressed because she didn't want to rush the clothing process, so she, in her towel, tried.  and nothing.  Then I tried, nothing.  Then all combinations of two of us tried... nothing... Then all three of us tried (random naked woman still naked, I might add)... and nothing.  I went to the desk and asked for paper clips to see if maybe I could pick the lock.  No go, they didn't have any.  At this point, the three of us agree that we are getting nowhere, and we need one of the trainers.  It was my job to stay in the locker room and wait for everyone to be clothed so desk woman could bring in a man.  Naked woman took HALF AN HOUR to put on some damn clothes.  She blew her hair dry... naked.  She put on make-up... naked.  She curled her hair... naked.  She put on lotion... naked.  All the while she was conversing with me.  I was more than a little uncomfortable, and was pretty much facing my locker and yelling the whole time because I was not interested in the show.  I decided that while I was looking at the locker anyway, I may as well work on the lock.  I couldn't possibly do anything counterproductive, at worst, nothing would happen.  I tried all kinds of creative ways to position myself and the bolt cutter to get the most leverage out of the arms, and the most force out of my body.  I even stuck one arm against the wall of lockers at one point, placed my body between the arms, and pulled toward myself.  Thankfully, that one was no more effective than any of the others.  Had it been, I would have crushed a few ribs, but at least I would have freed my health insurance card which I would surely have needed!

And finally, naked woman put some clothes on.  You would think after all the grooming that she was going to put on a ball gown or something, or at least a business suit, but no, just khaki capris and an orange tee shirt.  I RAN like I have never run before (at least indoors) to the front desk, and got the desk woman, and I stood guard so if anyone showed signs of stripping i could beg them to wait.  She brought in a trainer.  This man has not a visible bit of fat on him.  He has, thanks to steroids, managed to gain about 100 lean pounds over the course of this school year.  Quite impressive, poor heart of his!  He took the bolt cutter.  Two tries and the lock flew off!  REAL impressive.  My live was FREE!!

Other than that the rest of the day went rather normally.  Sunday morning I got up early to take Mark to the greyhound station so he could go home and get his car.  Being as he is the sweetest boy in the world, he had a surprise for me.  I mentioned to him, once and only once, that I love oatmeal cookies.  Knowing this, and knowing that I try to eat well, he had made, from scratch, low fat oatmeal cranberry walnut cookies, and he ATTACHED THE RECIPE!  They were delicious, but more than that, I totally melted into a puddle of Arielle mush.  I have never felt like I have connected with a guy like this ever before.  I think he truly understands me, I love talking to him (and listening to him), I have nothing but respect and admiration for him.  Its really sad, I am totally a school girl with a huge crush, but I have never had such an emotionally invested crush before. Its not just that I think every little thing he does is cute, I really really like everything about the whole person he is.  I am a little sad that after this week I might never see or hear from him again.  That would be a huge shame and a waste.  I don't know if he has any such feelings to reciprocate, but I need to find a way to tell him at least a little bit of what I think about him, because I don't want to lose him.  Trouble is I also don't want to scare him off and ensure that he disappears without a trace.  I didn't think guys like him existed.  Now I find out that they do, they are just disinterested... but I have no confirmation that he is completely disinterested, it is just my gut feeling.  He also didn't show up for class this morning.  This is not like him, and I want to call and make sure he got back okay, but I don't want to be scary or overbearing.  Maybe I will revisit this possibility tomorrow.  I am like a lovesick 12 year old... its sad.

Yesterday I actually got a lot of work done.  I have been making pretty typed outlines of all the material.  I get a lot out of making them, and it feels really good to have something tangible and pretty to show for hours of work.  Today I had my last classes of this godforsaken program.  I am done with class, and HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY WITH ANY LUCK IS ANYBODY UP THERE LISTENING?!?!!?!?! drexel post bacc forever... well, after Friday's exam.  I came home and did some work, went to the gym (sweat out frustration... its like marathon training!), went to whole foods because I was running out of food a little earlier than expected, and then came home, talked to mom, took a shower, ate and worked/watched TV.

Now I am exhausted.  Please, keep your fingers crossed for me.  UM says its wait list is still moving, and I know they are on my tier of the wait list.  I also know there is a tier below me.  Statistically, based on previous years, it would only be a matter of time.  But I cannot get complacent, not until there is an acceptance in my hot little hand.  Don't worry, I am not comfortable, I am terrified... but at least it is getting me in great shape!

Time for bed (at least to lay there if not necessarily to sleep), maybe even without an alarm!
Good night,
Arielle"

"event","So today was Friday, and that means spinning class.  Well when spinning clas time rolled around, I had already been in the gym for a while, and I needed to go back to my locker and exchange my nalgene for a water bottle that fits in the bike cup holder and put away my ipod.  Well, as soon as I had finished the swap, and heard that *click* of the lock so I could get to class, I realized what I had just done.

My nalgene had the key to the lock for the locker dangling from the loop of the cap.  Actually, my keyring has another copy of the key on it as well.  And now, both are locked in the locker.

I went to the front desk, and was told that the only decent bolt cutter was locked in the manager's office, and nobody who was there at the time had a key to the office.  Tomorrow someone with a key will be in.  Well, I went to class, figuring that the situation would not possibly change in the time that I was in class.  Class kicked my ass, hard, and by the end I felt and looked like total crap, but I guess in a good way.

When it was over I went back to the front desk to get my ID and figure out what I was going to do without my wallet, keys, phone, outerwear, notebook, etc.  The woman at the desk felt bad for me so she called the guy who has the key to the managers office, and he was of no use at all.  I imagine the reason she was so nice was because I was extremely vocal about the fact that I was well aware that I did this to myself, and I am, in fact, dumb as a post, but unlike a post my dumbness can bite me in the ass.  She said she knew there was a crappy bolt cutter somewhere in the gym, and we could go look all over for it and try it if we found it, but the chances of it working were slim to none. I accepted the challenge, and after about half an hour of searching the gym, she finds it sitting in plain view under the desk where we started.

This bolt cutter was in fact tiny and dull.  She took it to the locker room, and attempted to employ it to cut my heavy duty storage unit lock off my locker (used because it is all I had and I didn't want to buy a new one just for the gym).  Well, this so called bolt cutter scratched the surface of the finish of the lock, but didn't even make a dent.  In fact, quite the contrary.  The lock bent the blades of the bolt cutter.

Defeated, tired, soaking wet (eew), and slightly concerned about whether I am ever going to get my stuff out of that locker, I slinked home.  When I got to my apartment, I had to tell the security lady I was locked out of my apartment, and she scoffed at me, proceeded to sit there and sing while I stood there for 10 minutes, and finally called someone.  When the RHD got to me, he came with me to my apartment and opened the door.  Turns out my roommate was actually inside.

So, after severely overdoing it today, my body could seriously use a day off tomorrow, but no can do because I have to go get my lock cut, and I'll be damned if you think I am going to walk all the way there and not use the place.  I cannot really leave my apartment until I go back to the gym, because all this will accomplish is locking myself out.   Besides, can't do much with out my wallet, and will have a hard time getting anyone to do anything with me without a phone.  I could go to the library to study (my module guide was actually spared in this disaster and is sitting right next to me as I type), but I can only go for as long as I can stay satisfied on whatever I ate/drank before I left.

Other than that, I am extremely stressed out.  I am scared of what is going to happen to me next year, and even looking beyond that at this point.  I am not sleeping well, I have trouble falling asleep, when I do get there I have stressful dreams, and I wake up feeling like I hadn't ever gone to bed and with a racing heart and that same feeling of constant medium level (ok higher upon just waking) anxiety.

The lock was just that last kick in the ass.  I've had enough of today, I'm going to bed!  So there!  Ok fine, probably not, but soon."

It seems to me that there are actually a finite number of topics that country music can cover, and once they are all covered, the industry will go bust.  I hope this is not so.  There is a ton of terrible country out there, but there is also some real good stuff that I have only recently discovered, and you just can't help but smile and sing along to country.

Anyway, this has been a wasted weekend.  Yesterday I did approximately nothing at all until 2:00 when Mark called me and asked me if I wanted to take a walk over to the market.  We went, and he made a stop, out of the way, with me to CVS so I could buy some damn toilet paper and laundry detergent.  When we got back, I spent the rest of the day doing laundry, talking on the phone/IM, watching TV and being generally useless.  Exciting stuff, huh?

This morning I woke up all tangled in my comforter from my recurring nightmare of my teeth falling out.  The funny thing about it is that the circumstances are always different, but the dream always feels really real, and every time I wake up from it all distressed I check my mouth to make sure the teeth are all still in there.  They are.  I have looked into what this may mean, as I have the dream at least twice a month, and more like once or twice a week recently, and I found that it means that I feel like some aspect of my life is out of my control.  Big news, right?

I have also had a headache all day, but since I allowed myself the luxury of being completely useless all day yesterday, wallowing wasn't an option today.  I got up and studied for a while, then headed to the gym.  On my way back I stopped into Wawa and stocked up on soda and yogurt.  The woman I bought a sandwich for this winter was back outside.  I felt terrible for her when she came in the shop and asked the clerk for a light because she was hoping the cigarette she got would curb her appetite.  However, I did not feel like it was my duty to buy her food every time I went in... maybe next time though, I did feel really bad.

When I got home, I talked to my mom, took a shower, studied some more, ate dinner, made pesto with Mark who came over to use my food processor, and now I am watching Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy.

I hope tomorrow's my day.  I'm going insane, and I can't wait to get out of here and go home.  I swear, when I get there I will spend all summer hugging one parent till they get bored of me and have to move, and then switching to the other... all summer...  damnit they have to love me, its their JOB!

 From Robert Hinkley 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi! Here are some comments/observations from Robert Hinkley:

1. Having to wait on the alternate list does indeed suck. I couldn't agree more. I know some of you are out there waiting to hear from me and I wish I could call you this instant, but I can't.

2. The alternate list here at Miller started moving on May 11. The same thing probably happened at nearly all US medical schools.

3. I notify people initially by email and ask them to write back or CALL as soon as possible so everyone should read their email at least occasionally.

4. We have two campuses. If one is full, I will indeed offer the next student on the list a place at the one that's not full. The student then has two choices: a) accept the place and ask to transfer to the other campus when a spot opens up, or 2) remain on our alternate list for a place to open at the preferred campus. Transferring between campuses occurs in a chronological way. The accepted students who ask to transfer are transferred when a place becomes available before students who ask to transfer later. We will try to accommodate all accepted students before we admit someone from the alternate list to that campus. It is my responsibility that we have exactly 150 students at the Miami Campus and exactly 32 students at the Boca Campus. That's not easy to do.

5. I've never admitted any applicant on the recommendation of any student, either one who has been accepted or one who has withdrawn. I have a ranked alternate list that I am obligated to use as mandated by legislation of the faculty of the School of Medicine. I don't even do this for alumni, faculty members, or other administrators!!!!

6. Most withdrawals occur around May 15 (both before and shortly afterward. But some students continue to hold multiple acceptances well into June despite the AMCAS traffic rules to which they agreed when they filled out their AMCAS application. When they finally do make up their minds and withdraw that creates a vacancy that I need to fill. That can occur anytime up until orientation begins in August.

7. Another flurry of withdrawals occurs when we post the due date for a deposit. At that time we offer a compensatory number of acceptances from the alternate list.

8. Finally, if you interviewed with us, you know from my presentation on the interview day that the chances of being accepted from the alternate list are fairly good, at least eventually.

If anyone has any more questions or comments, feel free to write to me anytime at med.admissions@miami.edu. As you well know, this is one of the busiest times of the year for any admissions office and Agnes is on a well-deserved vacation but I'll try to answer questions as best I can."

"event","I will never, as long as I live, accept another spot on a wait list.  They provide a false sense of hope and security, and some even go so far as to make you think you actually have a chance.  Well, I will have no more of it.  I am tired of whoring out my heart, goals, convictions, and personal trials and tribulations, only to have it all stomped on... no, not even stomped on, wait listed.

I feel like I have been caught with my pants down.  I go to interviews, I put aside all shyness and ""be myself"" as genuinely as I would with any of my closest friends.  I tell stories of things that I do not like to speak about, defend myself against difficult questions or commentary, smile and show my heart and passion with which I hope to enter their field.  And every time, every single time, I am told that *I* am not good enough to become a member of their institution at that time.  I am not told that I am not good enough, mind you, simply that they do not want to limit their options.  What if someone who comes along after me is better but I am holding their spot?  Then whatever would they do?  Their class would be ruined and it would be all my fault.  I would cause a debauchery of everything *they* have worked so hard to mold their school into, the stats of their future entering classes would pulmmet, they would not have anybody match in anything competitive and their whole class would be shipped out to north dakota for residency in proctology, they would receive no research money, they would have to lay people off and the school would ultimately crumble to the ground under a pile of rubble with me standing on top holding my acceptance letter.  Why?  Because they admitted me without waiting to see what that other kid had to offer.  That other kid, the nobel prize winning, genius literacy teacher to the deaf of homeless battered children of the congo, discoverer of the cure of cancer, the common cold, make pattern baldness and razor burn and prima ballerina in the new york city ballet, oh, and don't forget her 4.0/43T (would have been a 45, but a few question in the bio section had mistaken answers as she can prove with her research in cancer and baldness.  Whew!  glad I got to spare them that humiliation.

So, no more.  No school will ever have to worry about the likes of me polluting their institution because they hit that last pathetic loser on their wait list.  Hell, I bet if it did come down to a)accept me, the last person, or b)leave that spot in the class unfilled and take the financial hit, they would probably choose to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars both in my own fees and public funding given to the school per head.

play whatever games you will, admissions committees, but leave my ass out of it!

This is feeling so familiar.  Anxious hope is starting to fade while anxious depression rears its ugly head.  Why do so many people have no problem with this process and I am ending my second cycle with still nothing.  I am a year out of college, and am in the position of an entering freshman... but instead of everything being new, and fresh, and figuring out the future being exciting, I am old, bitter and scared.

The booze cruise was a bust.  The boat was really small.  It had two levels, but it was too cold to go up onto the top level, so everyone, all 120 people, crammed in downstairs.  And the ceiling was 6'5''.  That's a bit rediculous.  There was a bar with a single bar tender, and open bar for the first hour, so for the first hour everyone stood in line at the bar.  I had a rum and diet, my usual, and it was terrible, like real bad.  I couldn't figure out why it tasted so bad either.  The badness wasn't rum, and it wasn't diet coke.  Eew.  Other than that, it was boring, crowded, and my ""friends"" who I always go out with seemed to be avoiding me.  They were all really drunk too.  I hung out for a while with this guy Steve, and I like him a lot, but I think even he got tired of me, and I found myself bored, tired, awkward, lonely and counting minutes till I got to leave.  Oh, and there was only one bathroom and when I went nobody gave me the heads up that the sink didn't work, so I took a big ol' handful of soap, and then tried to turn on the water, so then I was sticky too.  My stomach was a little ""off"" the whole time, and it made my head kind of achy, but all in all, I did okay motion sick wise.  I looked real hot though in a halter and black pants, but nobody seemed to care.  Anyway, I skipped going to the bar afterwards and just went home, where I belong.

There are two ways to take your emotions out on your body... the gym and the bottle.  I chose the former, and since my slight over-doing yesterday, I cannot stand up, sit down, squat, climb stairs or even sit indian style or on my feet without immense burning pain.  I think i tore my quads.  Yes, both of them.  In the future, must stretch when doing squats!

Oh, and speaking of the gym, when I was running today i kept my phone with me, in case of any admissions love.  To my surprise, at 4:30, the damn thing actually rang!  And I tripped and almost fell off!  But sadly, it was not the admissions call I had hoped for, but my mom.  At least my mom loves me.

I have a bunch of personal things to catch up on, like laundry and making my dinner for the week and whatnot, and for some reason I cannot get it together to get it done.  Tomorrow some people in my class are having a ""bring your own food"" barbecue.  Essentially, if you want a main course, you have to bring it.  Other things are being brought, but there is nothing being supplied by the hosts except the grill.  I think this is tacky and poorly executed, but who am I to say anything.  I am bringing fruit salad.  I don't need a main course, I need to cook anyway, so I can have dinner later.

That's about it for today.  Its nice to have two days off following an exam.  I really hope I can get my life together tomorrow before I have to go back to class on thursday.  Mostly, I can't wait to go home.

Well this was peppy!

"event","There are these itty bitty structures in your inner ear.  The ampulla, which is inside the semicircular ducts detects angluar acceleration while the saccule and utticle detect linear acceleration.  Their job, ultimately, is to make you vomit while you are on any ride Busch Gardens advertises.  Thankfully, I am not vomiting (I swore that if I ever did that again I would have my stomach removed and I would eat through a central line for the rest of my life), but the ups and downs of my life seem to be stimulating the hair cells in those itty bitty structures nonetheless, and I am experiencing a tad of nausea.

Now, the fact that I could write that paragraph without looking at my notes is a good sign for my exam on Monday (I'll take whatever I can get there), but it doesn't say much for my emotional state otherwise.  I have been really cautiously optimistic about this Miami Alternate thing, but suddenly, like in the past 10 minutes, I have caught a wave of impending doom, and I suddenly feel like my anxiety directed toward May 15th is going to be replaced by the beginning of the five stages of mourning by tuesday.

Let me explain.  As you know (and if you didn't previously, pretend), I have developed a shameless compulsion toward the public forums on studentdoctor.net.  I don't post, that wouldn't be like me at all, but I do read.  I am looking to it for some sort of encouragement, or information, or hope, or something...  There has been this thread dedicated to people on the Miami Alternate List, and as of tonight it is three pages long.  Well, I called the school about a week ago and was told that they hadn't opened their wait list yet.  I considered this to be good news in light of the fact that I had not received a call yet.  Well, on this site, tonight I learned from someone who was talking to an admissions secretary at the commencement ceremony today that they pulled two people from their alternate list on Friday 5/13 and expect to pull three more on Monday.  Further, they say that most of their movement will take place before the end of the month.

This makes me absolutely nauseous.  I was obviously not one of the two pulled on Friday, and suddenly I have a wave of dread that I am not going to get the call at all.  I feel naked, as I have shared a good amount of myself, and let down my steely facade at my interview to make sure I projected confidence and a strong sense of self.  I was told at the time I interviewed very well, but I feel like in that situation I was forced to share things about myself that I don't like to talk about.  I have also sent multiple letters to the dean of admissions at this point, again I fear exposing personal weakness in a desperate attempt to be chosen. I guess all I can do is hope.

Other than that, I have spent the last two days sitting at my desk studying, and its about damn time.  I have gotten a lot done, and I am starting to feel better about the material, I just wish I could have summoned the motivation earlier.  It is not an issue of laziness, but rather one of emotional energy.  I am drained.

Tomorrow, I am desperately hoping that I can get myself to the point of educated where I can pass my exam.  I am scared too that if I don't end up getting accepted this year, then my grades, which reflect having done at or above the level of the M1 class here, will not be good enough purely in terms of numbers.  Its a catch 22.

For now, I really like the idea of crocheting, but I haven't been able to justify the time to myself for a few days.  Maybe that is what I need tonight.

Thanks for listening, and I hope to have good news soon.

"event","So, I am suffering from a bad case of the burnout blues.  This school year is exactly one month too long.  In some ways I am grateful for it.  I mean, this time last year I had graduated with nothing to do but eagerly check the mailbox, and curse the mailman when the one thing I was looking for was never there.  This time around, May 15th is going to come and go, and I am going to spend the whole day studying.  It may be a pathetic and futile attempt on my part to keep my mind busy so I don't drive myself crazy.  And it sounds like a good plan.

Even some of the best intentioned plans are impossible to execute.  Instead of studying taking my mind off of wait lists, the inverse has occurred.  I have an exam on Monday, the 16th.  It is going to be hard.  I am burnt out, I am stressed, and I don't care.  I got myself to sit down and study today, which felt good, but I am not as prepared as I would like to be at this point, and I don't know if I am going to be able to get there in time.  Also on the 16th is the IMS booze cruise, and I'll post a secret online for everyone to see... I don't want to go... shhhh don't tell.  I mean, I am, because there is no good way out, but I don't really drink (at least not nearly as much as the rest of the program, and not beer which is what's free), I get sea sick, and when you are on a boat, you can't just say this is lame and leave.  Maybe I'll get some lovin', but doubtful.

Not helping is the fact that the exam itself is sitting in my inbox.  I have not looked at it, but I fear that I may be the only one.  I am damned if I do and damned if I don't because the average is going to be crazy high.  Taking the high road is going to get me screwed by those with less integrity, not taking the high road would cause paranoia and ulcers.  I don't need any more ulcers, and we all know I am a big baby when it comes to stomach trouble!

I talked to Adam for the first time in a LOOOOOOOONG time tonight.  It is really nice to know that people who I have fallen out of touch with still care.  I am at a point in my life where the best way to my heart is to show that you somehow care about me.  He made an incredible offer to use a connection he has at University of Florida with a Parkinson's group.  I think that to pursue it at this particular point would be putting the cart before the horse, but in a week I may start to seriously consider this.  I know that research is not the weakness in my application, however I don't want to stay here next year, so I am therefore interested in the opportunity to leave yet still do something related and that would make me look interested and strong as a candidate.  In any event, I am indescribably appreciative toward his thinking of me.  It shows a lot of faith in a person to recommend her to someone who respects you.

Anyway, I got a bunch of work done today, but much more is in store for tomorrow.  Friday the 13th.. and I am hoping for it to be a luck one.  I can't afford to lose anymore sleep!

"event","Amazing isn't it how things that we work so hard on can be so transient?  I mean, a chef puts his heart and soul into making a beautiful meal only to have it disappear without a trace beyond dirty dishes in a matter of minutes.  An athlete pours blood sweat and tears into developing a skill, only to become too old, or injured or exhausted to push on.  A student absorbs knowledge like a sponge for countless years at the expense of a personal life only to be left wondering if having watched one less hour of television would have made all the difference in achieving acceptance to the next step that have been looking toward for as long as her memory can look back. (I might be a little bitter on that one.)  Anyway, I started this entry about an hour ago, and with one careless slip of the thumb across the touch pad, I find myself starting over.

Over the years, more than a few people have suggested that I keep a journal.  I always did acknowledge that this was an excellent outlet for others, yet I always strongly resisted.  ""I am just not a journaler,"" I would say.  After all, I know what I am thinking and feeling, and writing it down won't change anything.  It always seemed painfully boring for me to sit down and write down things that nobody would ever see.  I write for the benefit of others, and I  can think very efficiently without the help of a pen and paper.  Further, being as I am an extremely private person, it seems that the best way for your innermost emotions to get out would be to inconspicuously write them down in a medium that nobody should ever know about.  To me, this ensures that the very issues I was so reluctant to discuss will be discovered, divulged and disseminated before I even have the chance to realize I have been careless with insecurities.  One may think that this is a lot of paranoia to be expressed by an only child who has precious few secrets, none of which are sordid, and very little to hide.  However, I tend to be about as introverted as a heavily guarded fort, and I am extremely easily embarrassed...  So why should I take away from my precious time deepening the groove my ever-growing ass makes in my couch to do something I don't believe in?

So, you must be asking yourself, ""Self, what has changed?""  Well, over the last couple years a majority of aspects of my life seem to have taken 180 degree turns.  My feelings toward my body have been turned upside down, and I have traded in the remote control for running shoes.  All my security blankets have been ripped from my tightly coiled fists, and I have been left feeling empty, naked and vulnerable.  My future has come into question, and has yet to see any resolution.  And along with these changes, my emotions have run the gamut from devastated to elated to downright apathetic.  I think and I feel and I obsess, and until now I have made it my business to keep it my business.

I have always been guilty of some kind of mind-body disconnect.  Before, my mind was (arguably) in good shape while my body was my outlet of self destruction.  I simply paid it no attention.  Today, the opposite is true.  My body is my temple, and I take care of it in every way possible.  I have let my mind go, however.  I am too anxious these days to sleep, and when I do sleep I have nightmares.  When awake I have developed a protective apathy.

So, alas, I find myself journaling.  But this is different than the journal that I previously so vehemently resisted.  It is public, and not only do I think my friends might read it, I expect they will.  I am hoping to achieve some relief from my emotional roller coaster while amusing others.  Its a win-win situation.

So, in this, my second entry, I thank you, my friends, for listening and understanding as I sort out my tormenting thoughts and feelings, and I assure you that along the way you will get some laughs out of the deal."

"event","Well, I have spent countless hours checking others' journals, so it is only fair to give y'all the same courtesy I have come to count on.

I think its safe to assume that anyone who knows how to find me this way has a vague idea at least of what has gone on in my life recent history, so I will just start at the latest, and i can back track if anyone expresses any such desire.

I realized today that the moment I have been waiting for since August is finally approaching, the year is drawing to a close.  I have learned a ton, about a lot of things.  I feel like a have a fairly good handle on a wide variety of bodily processes which previously were just elusive mysteries.  I have learned a lot about myself as well.  I got through four years of college without the constant security blanket of my parents, but I feel like for the first time this year, I have truly survived on my own.  To my surprise, I can handle it, but I have to say, I don't really like it.  In college, after very little time, I always felt like I was surrounded by people and places that made my environment into a true home.  When I settled here, I expected it would be only natural for something similar to happen - eventually I would find people who would make Philly and Drexel into home.  Again, to my surprise, looking back, that never happened.  I have gone through the motions of every day in an empty and mechanical manner.  There is nobody here who I feel like I really truly connected with, nobody who I would talk to freely, nobody with whom I am not completely guarded at all times, and nobody who I am not self-conscious around.  I miss Emory and Atlanta, but most of all, I miss the people who made Emory into the home I remember fondly and long for.

Also this year, I really learned who my friends were in college.  ""Black Monday,"" as I still refer to it, was a year ago today.  I sat in that sea of chairs, and choked back tears for hours as the people who had come to define my sense of self and home proudly walked across the stage which obstructed my last views of my beautiful quad.  When I take a look at the group of people I have kept in touch with in the past year, in some ways it is surprising.  There are a handful of people who I was sure I would talk to regularly for the rest of my life, and to my dismay they have dropped out of contact with barely a trace beyond away message updates.  It makes me sad, but at the same time, it reassures me that I can survive without the constant support of people I had come to depend so heavily upon.  More important though, is that I have found that some people who I really cared about at Emory who I was never sure I would hear from again have stuck around.  Today, I find myself with a group of extremely geographically widely distributed friends, who are emotionally just as close, if not closer than they were a year ago today.  The world is a scary place, but it is not as big as it seemed the day entropy took its toll on us.  This certainly doesn't only apply to my class, during my latter years there, I saw the people who had graduated before me as part of the total picture of my surroundings.  You were there in spirit.  If you are reading this, and I haven't told you recently, your friendship beyond the Emory bubble means the world to me.

As far as my life goes, I am still in limbo.  This time last year I was paralyzed with anxiety and depression at the prospect of graduating with nothing to do or show for all my hard work.  In this year, I have found that I have a ton to show for having gone to Emory, even if I couldn't see it at the time.  I am a different person than I was when I entered.  I have grown up.  I may not know what I am going to be doing ten years from now or the path that will take me there, but the journey helped me to find myself, determine what is really important to me, what I really enjoy, what impact I ultimately want to make upon the people and world around me.  Strangely, in terms of my career to come, I currently find myself in the same place I was on that hot Atlanta day a year ago.  I am not paralyzed by depression at the moment however, but rather strangely numb.  I will be sure to keep you posted on that... May 15 is not far away. What hasn't killed me has made me stronger, and while I want more than anything in this world to just catch a break, I find myself much less fragile than I did a year ago.  Maybe that is just burnout and exhaustion talking, who knows?

I guess that's enough to chew on for now.  Enjoy my journal, I promise it will not always be this introspective.  I guess i should unwind some so I just might have some dreams at NIGHT and be refreshed for a long day of futile studying tomorrow.

Till then,
Arielle"

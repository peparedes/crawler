"event","Just for the record, and so I can get it off my chest. I never lied to you. You know who you are. I loved you with all my heart and I never did anything, despite what you think, to ever even begin to betray your trust. I never meant to hurt you if I did. I dont know why you hate me now, and I dont know why you broke it off after coming back from Stu. Co camp in June. I dont know.. but I do know that I'll always love you for who you are. A beautiful, fun, and intelligent person. You hurt me more than I ever wish hurt upon another human being, but thats the price of love some times I suppose. You will be in my thouhgts and dreams forever. One more thing, before I go...

"event","So, we were SUPPOSED to go see Avenue Q last night, because David's dad is one of the producers and was going to score us free tickets... that didnt happen. Instead, more than one dream came true last night as I saw RENT! Not only that, I got FIRST ROW tickets! It was just amazing! Ok, so we lotteried off our names to get the tickets, and the last name they called was Stan's (who was on the phone with some chick who said he gave her his number on 6th street?) and so we got all excited and ran and got the tickets. Another thing that bugs the hell out of me is that it seems like no one here is excited about life in general. No one else celebrated but us. 

So, we meet up with Al after he gets off work, go to this Italian place (where the waitor kept hitting on me, ew, mexicans named Viktor scare me now) and of course, he kept pouring me more whine. Stan was nice enough, to let David and I have the tickets, because I had never seen it before. David talked about having drinks, or going out with the cast after the show to dinner. Wait... what? He can make that happen?! Holy Crap! So, they trusted me to get on the subway, in a city I had never been to before, with 3 glasses of wine I had just drank, and get to the theatre (a good 4 miles away) in 30 minutes...


... So 45 minutes later I walked in the doors w/ David as 'Light My Candle' began. Freakin amazing show, once again. I paid for David's ticket originally ($20 by the way... you CANT beat that!) so he bought me a $30 RENT T-shirt to make up for it. I love jews! =-) After the show, we went out front to wait for the cast. Maureen (who is un-Godly HOT by the way) was the one I was waiting for. But I ended up getting all but her signature on my play bill. I now own a playbill with the entire cast of RENT's autographs.. The guy that played Mark was kinda giving me the eye and acted like he wanted to go out for drinks... I was very happy to annouce to David and anyone else that was listening in the crowd that I was waiting for that ""Incredibley Sexy Chick that played Maureen!"" at the top of my lungs. We then witnessed the techies pants eachother, in all of their drunken glory, then talked to them and the homeless guy named Rob who sold me one of his papers that are supposed to be good luck before the lottery. Worked, didnt it? hehe I got him to sign the play bill too. Nice guy. We then walked about 300 miles to find a place where David, Al, Stan, and I could eat. We ended up at a Diner by Al's place and I kept insisting to the owner that I looked like Antonio Banderas. *I was so happy at this point to have seen RENT, I dont know what I was talking about* but he agreed that I could have been him, and gave us free mashed potatoes. I then came back to Al's with he and Stan and went to bed. Tip for the wise, DO NOT share a bed with Stanton! 

Today I went around walking by myself. Watched 'Be Cool' with John Travolta and illegal DVD's in china town. Waiting for Al to get off work around 8:30 so we can get dinner and enjoy my last night here. We're going to D.C. tomorrow, so, I probably wont be able to write till I get back to Texas. *Sigh* I'm really not looking forward to going back there. Too many problems and I still dont feel like I can face them yet. She is still on my mind alot, and it seems like it will never get better. I dont know if I want her to go away, and thats what hurts the most. Dont know what to do... Guess I'll just have to wait and see. Regards.

P.S. - I got a job interview as a internet analyst for some company on Friday. Wish me luck!"

"event","Hey people! I am now officially in New York City, New York! Freakin exciting, right? About now you're asking yourself ""Why in the blue hell is he in NYC?"" Well, let me explain...

Friday night was the Harry Potter release party that I attended w/ Rob and we got our books and Audio CD's around then. Being the HP junkie I am, I went and stayed up all night reading/listening (when I wanted to lay down). Although, sleep never came to me. I had decided that a certain someone shall indeed recieve the HP I picked up for her and Swampfoot early the next morning and I was going to drive to Athens, Texas at 7AM. I got home and was in bed about 2AM... then the insomnia hit. More of a 'Really want to read this' and 'I cant stop thinking about how much I miss that girl' thing. Even though I knew I shouldnt be thinking about her, alas, I was. It made me quite sad. So, I stayed up till 7 and went to pick up Rob, once again, and we drove the 234 miles to Athens, Texas.

The drive was uneventful, but man was being there fun! It was seriously the first time I smiled since... I last saw a girl in nothing but a bathrobe (which was about a month ago). Rob, Sarah D, Gretchen, some girl named Emily, and I went to this crappy pizza place in Athens that they LOVED because it was 'real' food. Haha. Poor girls. Next, we went to the po-dunk grocery store next door to it. This is where the REAL fun happened! I built myself a nice little (6 ft tall) fort of cereal boxes. Then, I yelled at Rob to ""Lay me under seige"" with assorted fruits. He refused at first, but then came the plums, and the watermelons... we left shortly after I found a baby hockey stick and shot plums between Sarah's legs (Who was sitting in the middle of the isle w/ her legs spread, playing w/ plastic dinosaurs). Really fun! All of this was done, while I made mean comments to Gretchen about hooking up with some random Mexican guy she's known for 5 days... Some people, I swear...

We departed company and I of course, got lost somewhere between Athens and Dallas, so, it was an hour of wondering, and then 3 more of driving back to P-ville. All of this, mind you, going on no sleep.  I got home, around 4 and was only there for maybe 20 minutes before Stephanie IMed me and asked if I'd like to go to Target w/ her. 5 minutes later, I was in her car on the way there. We had fun playing in the isles and she listened to my rant about how 'Furryville' creatures were raciest. They were! The pandas were all asian looking and standing by the Grand Canyon and they had family names like ""The Gorillabergs"" and they were a jewish family of Gorillas standing by a bank. Such bad stereotypes. I was ashamed.

It didnt last long, as by this time I was tired and wanted to go home and nap. Didnt happen. Miah called and so did Tasha, then Pam... so, I got looked at to make plans. I suggested we go see Wedding Crashers, so we did. Oh man. I dont know who the red head is in that movie, but wow... she was awesome! lol I really liked it. Will Ferrell made a cameo and totally stole the movie. The chick from The Notebook was in it, and it made me realize that I was in love w/ her character. The way she acted, there was just something about it. I dont know, its hard to explain in words, but I felt like I know SOMEONE like that, but I cant think of who exactly. Which makes me sad. The movie also made me realize that I dont have anyone in my life (romanticly) that I can depend on and have that kind of relationship I want with. I got really REALLY down about this and Miah was too, so, we made eachother feel great coming back. When we did.. I found about 12 people sitting in front of my house. My first thought was ok, this is about those damn hateful letters/ emails Kris Brown has been leaving me... I'm gonna get jumped. Then I saw one of the faces was Larkin. Uh oh, this can only mean one thing...

PARTY! lol I didnt have a choice in the matter really. I played host, but went upstairs for about 2 hours and read Harry Potter. Ryan came by for a minute and I hung out with him, but then everyone was gone by 3AM. Finally some sleep! First night I've slept in my house in a week (been staying at the McFaddens down the street). Fell asleep, planning on sleeping late. 9AM someone knocks at my door. Its some ass trying to look at the house. GROWL!

This is where I lost it. The sadness, the depression, the demands, the lies, the non-trust, everything. Everthing thats been bugging me the past year just came out and I lost it and drove down the street to yell at a fence (so the people looking at the house wouldn't hear). I decided, there's no way in hell I can get over that girl (you all know which one, even if I dont say her name) hanging around this town. So, I looked in my trunk (because ALL of life's problems can be caused/solved by the things in my trunk ;-) I found an old card from Stan and well...

10PM Sunday I set out to get to Foggelsville, PA. Its supposed to take 25 hours to get there, I made it in 26 because of a very bad side trip to Tennessee for gas. To you readers out there who have never been to Tennessee, NEVER GO! ITS HORRIBLE!!! Needless to say, at this point, I had about 6 hours of sleep in the 96 hours I had been awake. Driving all night doesnt do wonders for your looks either. I swear I spent 16 hours in Virginia. Oy.

I finally made it, but  not before the deleria set in. I saw Fog Monsters. Seriously... scary what the mind can invision when it hasnt rested in ALONG time. I got to Stan's and was amazed at the size of his basement. I went to bed, after suggesting that we make collars for Mexicans that translate what they're saying in English (like the one they use for dogs, ya know?) I was out like a light.

Next day I went to Allentown with Stan, then took the bus to NYC and met Al! I miss hanging out w/ these guys soooo much! I love um like my true brothers. Al took me to a diner, his dorm, a bar (Long Island ice teas are SO good!) and then Washington Square Park where we enjoyed a victory dance and I made comments about the size of the rats running around the streets. We watchen an episode of The Sopranos, which is a great show, and went to bed.

Woke up at noon today and got lunch at the NYU Stu Cafeteria. It doesnt hold a candle to UCLA's.. hehe. Score one for the West Coast! Then I spent the whole day by myself, walking the streets of NYC looking for Sam French Play Co. I didnt get lost once, but didnt know the address, so, it took me awhile. Such a cool place by the way, I suggest going. Talked to Marshall and tried to call C Paint while I was there, but to no aval. I swear I saw an Olsen twin on my way back to the dorm! She was REALLY short and not as cute as I'd hoped. She smiled at me though. I'd give a leg to know what she was thinking...Came back to the dorm, showered (its hot as a crotch here too) and have been chilling ever since. I wanna go visit The WTC site before Al gets off work at 8:30 or so. I'm gonna go do that now, I think. Avenue Q tomorrow night and Washington D.C. on Saturday to look forward to. Peace people!

P.S. - Does anyone know how to get yourself to stop thinking about someone? I could really use it. Thanks a million."

"event","So, today was Day 1 of Tyler's hockey try outs for 'The San Antonio Diablos' hockey team. I of course, went to support Ty and check out the competition. WOW! I've been away from the ice for too long because I had no idea people became such a-holes when they're at this stage. I got there in the middle of the 2nd and watched for a full hour as guys went and beat eachother into the corner, picked fights for the hell of it with strangers, and scored goals because the goalie was too busy looking at the middle school girls in the audience. WTF?! What happened to REAL, GOOD, hockey? Did I miss something? I wanted to grab a stick and some skates and show those jerks up right then and there. Tyler did ok though, so the night was a success.

Something REALLY good happened when I got home. That certain girl that I'm head over heels for left me a secret messege in a code only she and I know. *Gasp* lol. Yeah... I'm a dork. Whats it to ya? I'm beat and still REALLY sore from working out with C Walls the other night. So, its Louis & Clark: The New Adventures of Super Man and then bed time. Night!

P.S. - As far as the incident at Tinseltown last night goes, and to that person, everyone knows what happened. You cant lie to anyone. I have my reasons for why I did what I did, and I'm eager to hear you spin the truth into something else. Your lies are adding up my friend, and some day very soon, your worth to a certain something will be no more than that of your IQ. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.

About 100% worse actually, but I dont wanna go into it. Anyway, after I hit rock bottom I went back to physics and spent 2 hours w/ Mr. Holder talking about how a pelican can drop a fist at an angle of 18 degrees, but he cant find a decent belt to keep his pants up. Oy! Then tech rehearsal (that I was late for)that went kinda fast actually. I've discovered how much I really like The History of Tom Jones. It's quickly becoming one of my favorite shows to work on. Then China Dragon with the crew and Goodwill with Love, Will, & Abby. That's always fun. Then a VERY interesting car ride back to my car where I learned many a new thing about certain people. It made me smile though to know that someone would ask me out on a date right now (though maybe not the person I'd want to ask me out). lol I dunno... lately I feel like its all a lost cause. I'm so tired all the time. Well tomorrow brings more physics, more problems, and (hopefully) more fun! Goodnight peeps!"

A guy who would ""Use"" girls or string them along until they hated me and lost interest. But I've done some thinking and I've realized that I'm not that guy. 

I never wanted a bunch of girls, I was just looking for the right one. I dated Kelsey for 5 months, and when that ended, I hated women. Molly though, Molly changed my mind. I promised myself before I finally said yes to Molly that she'd be the last one for a few years....just didnt know I'd fall for her like I did. I know why Molly and I didnt work out at the end. I have a confidence problem. I know you wouldnt know by looking at me (or watching me walk) but I do. I started to get freaked out that Molly was gonna leave me and I started reading too much into things and started looking for when she'd leave so I could fix things. Problem is, I'm not a patient person, and I'd get angry over little things. No wonder she left me, I'm a failure at relashionships. It's times like this that I envy Kelsey so much. See, we both have these insecurities that come from our parents abandoning us, or some crap like that. Anyway, it makes us both put up these walls of anti-trust and insecurties, to where we look for things wrong to happen and ruin the relashionship. 

I envy Kelsey because she has a boyfriend who understands this about her and loves her anyway...I dont. Molly understood it, but couldnt put up with it. I understand and I dont blame her...I just wish she were the person for me who did understand and stayed until it passed. 

This all makes me wonder though if there is hope for me in the future. Is there? I guess only time will tell. Let me know what you guys think..."

Auditions for The History of Tom Jones are tomorrow. As per usual I am anxious to auditon and am hoping for a nice part for a change. After all, Stanton did Will me all the male leads for this year at banquet, so, it could happen! Hell, Molly even started the talk about how her and Sarah were discussing how whomever plays Tom Jones will have to make out with quite a few girls...then gave me that look. Already, I'm in trouble with The Mrs.

But I love her, so, it's all good. My fan is making a funny noise, maybe I should find out what it is and fix it. I know I really should work on some stuff for college & English, but somehow I just dont feel like it.. hmm Damn, Molly just called and she JUST got out. Homecoming stuff must have kept her forever. *Hint Hint* If nominated I will walk down the court escorted by my mom and I'll wear a kilt. I'll have them announce that my hobbies include puzzles, surfing, and making maccoronni pictures of Jesus! Plus I dont really wanna win, just be nominated so I can do all that.

Oh man, if I didn't love to sing I'd get the hell outta there so fast Neff's head would spin. 

Then Theatre...which I dont like. It feels like I'm in a Theatre II class instead of Advanced. It really sucks because Molly, Will, Sarah, and everyone else is in 3rd period and Katie and I are stuck with the kids. Oy. Now Jeff & Chelsea are getting out and Katie & I talked to Coach about dropping it.... lets just say, that isn't going to happen. 

I'm still waiting for my physics class to be 5th period, and then 6th will be off. WoOhOo! If Phillips ever gets off her purple toad ass (Thanks for that Will). Well, tomorrow night I have a pretty hot date with Molly and a little something something planned for her. If you'd like to know then ask me and I MIGHT let you in on my secret.

I, don't don't don't believe I fell asleep talk's a waste of time
The roller coaster that I rode with her on Valentines
And all I see I don't don't don't believe
And what you see is what you get with me
Wasting all your time


Going all the way, looking so helpless
Everyday
Daddy's little defect
All the same
Keep your secrets away from me


If you want to be mine
So don't don't don't make a sound your father's around to play with your head
The gift-wrapped guilt-trip kisses left you naked in your bed
And all I see don't don't don't believe
And all you see is what you get with me
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time


Going all the way, looking so helpless
Everyday
Daddy's little defect
All the same
Keep your secrets away


Going all the way, looking so helpless
Everyday
Daddy's little defect
All the same
Keep your secrets away


Letting go
Letting go again
Letting go
Letting go and your left with nothing
Let go it will be aright


I, don't don't don't believe I fell asleep talk's a waste of time
The roller coaster that I rode with her
Wasting all your time
Wasting all your time


Going all the way, looking so helpless

Keep your secrets away

Waiting for you
If you wanna be mine

"event","ok so i was on newgrounds and i found the best FF parody every... its a music video, and im going to post the words to the song^_^

Final Fantasy is an RPG
The only one that i need
it;s the RPG for me
Final Fantasy is all that i play
All other games are lame
it puts them all to shame

i only play games that are popular
i only buy the games the magazines tell me to buy
That way i know i get good games for sure
i may have a shallow mind
but you can kiss my behind

Final Fantasy; it consumes my life
and that is why
ill never have a wife
Final Fantasy has awesome music
and thats probably why it
always gets remixed

i always buy the soundtrack to each game
oh t is the only thing i will listen to
oh sure one day it may drive me insane
you may think that im a fool
well im here to say ""screw you!""

Final Fantasy on Play sation 2
with music by noguo
and graphics by wong chu
its final fantasy number ten
mustt save the world again
right from my own den

hopefully ill get through the game just fine
i dont know why i continue to play each game
theyll be making these things till the end of time
oh i guess that i will pay
for these games til dooms day
-end

it is so much funnier with the cylon voice and music"

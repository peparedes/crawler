I ran 15 miles yesterday.  I was only supposed to run 12, but ended up getting lost and got in an extra 3.  Then I went to swim lessons.  Needless to say, I slept well last night."

The holiday's were very nice but way too fast.  We made it down and back from Cinci.  

I have kept up with my running during this time.  I joined a new gym.  I am now a member of hte YMCA...Boardman branch.  It is SO nice.  I really think I am going to enjoy it.

So far my race schedule is as follows:
Mill Creek Half Marathon March 4
Glass City Marathon April 15 - still debating
Flying Pig Half Marathon May 6
Cleveland Marathon May 20 - still debating

I am definitely going to run a full marathon.  I just need to decide which one - April or May.  There are pros and cons to both.  I am leaning towards the April 15th.  Will keep all posted."

"event","We were awakened this morning to find out that my 26 year old cousin died.  If that wasn't bad enough, he shot himself in the head and was DOA at 1:30 this morning.  I am just sick about this and feel SO helpless.  My dad is on his way down there now...and we will follow once something is figured out.  Robby has fought depression for several years and had been getting help.  Apparently his depression won out.  This is just such a shock and I hardly know how his parents and grandparent will be able to deal with this event.  Robby has always been a lost soul.  This past summer was the last timeI saw him.  He was at the family reunion and carried around a bag of fish to feed his pirahna(however you spell that)...he was so concerned about his pet...he eventually had to go home to feed it.

He would totally give you the shirt off his back...even if he didn't have another one for himself...

He will be cremated and there will be a memorial service at some point.

God Bless Robby!"

"event","Some time people pleasantly surprise me...in September Kade Kotheimer was involved in a terrible accident.  He was struck by a car and run over by multiple vehicles.  Kade has been in a coma ever since plus he suffered multiple breaks, bruises that are beyond the brain trauma.  This occurred in Speedway, Indiana.  Kade's mom teaches music with my mom and Kade's dad is a retired policeman for Boardman.  There have been many fund raisers in our area as well as Speedway to help raise money for his funds.  Kade is a 23 year old man.  He was married this past May.  His wife is working on her masters degree and Kade is a fireman/paramedic.  They had recently bought a house and things were so positive for them.  Then this happens.  SO...my mom asks me last week if I know anyone who owns an ice cream place.  Conveniently, one of the guys I work with is part owner of a Katie's Korner.  I called and asked him if they would donate some of the ice cream for Kones for Kade...They are donating 60 gallons of ice cream.  Then we got the bright idea to have us serve it to the school aged children...then we decided to incorporate some of our sponsors of Valley Proud.  These seven businesses are going to be there as well donating money to Kade's trust fund.  The sales guys are giving there time to help...plus we are going to close our office and each of us is going to work a shift serving the children the Kones.  We are hoping to raise lots of money for Kade.

It just goes to show that there really are good people out there..."

"event","I'll have to post the picture later...but I wanted to dedicate this post to my best furry friend.  TIGER.  Tiger is an eight year old boxer.  Technically she is my brother's dog; however, she sleeps with me, I am the one that feeds her, and pays for everything so I consider her my baby.  We got Tiger on July 7th.  She was just a little baby.  She loved to cuddle and be carried everywhere.  For the first several weeks that she was with us she slept on Billy's chest.  Spoiled much?  She loves to play.  She can control her teeth but not those nails!  She has tons of chew toys and loves to bring them to you for a few minutes.  She loves to sit at the table and cry for food.  It is rather pathetic.  She has us trained that anytime we go to the refrigerator she gets a 'puppy treat'  She is a tiny boxer at only 45 pounds but she can pull a 300 pound man if she wants something.  Recently, my dad has begun walking at 4:30 in the morning.  He walks a mile and has been taking Miss Tiger with him.  This morning, it snowed, and she still went.  She came home and sprawled herself across the couch!

I love my baby girl....

So this morning as I was gathering my 'stuff' to meet up witht he running group I am in, I realized I have lots of 'stuff' to bring with me to go out for a simple run.

Today's run didn't include my headband or the ipod which I use when running by myself.  

So, in no particular order.  Garmin forerunner...must have to know the time, distance and speed of the run.  Gloves/mittens...necessary to keep hands warm.  Neck warmer...also can be pulled up over mouth, nose and ears for warmth, chap-stick...must have kissable lips(MWAH) and lastly I must run with a tissue...summer, fall, winter, spring, a tissue is necessary.

I just realized that I ran without my HR monitor today...geez...I thought running was supposed to be an easy sport...lace up your shoes and go!  HA!"

On Friday, Nov 10th we went down to Cinci for the BridgeBowl 2006.  It is the last game of the seasno every year for Mount St. Joe's and Thomas More College.  Saturday afternoon the game was played at Dixie High School.  TMC beat an undefeated Mount team.  It was very exciting...there were even a couple of fights.  Thankfully, we always know were Billy is (safe and sound).  After the game we went to the hennessey's to celebrate Johnny's birthday and the victory.  It was a great weekend.

Here is a current picture of Tiger.  She is such a good girl.  She loves to cuddle with me but is always willing to play.  She lets me know if I am up past bedtime and will gladly wake me up if I sleep in too long!  I can't believe that she is 8 years old.  It seems like yesterday that we brought this little 8 week old puppy home.  She slept on Billy's chest for weeks.  He just loves her...even if he calls her Cujo...He can get her to play no matter what.  When he had his surgery last Spring she was in total protection mode.  She didn't want anyone to mess with him or his knee.  Thankfully when the doctor visited we had her in the cage, who know what she would have done.  She enjoys sleeping in Billy's bed since he is away at school.  She has made a 'nest' of his pillows and she sleeps in the middle of them."

The tumor was partially removed and left the sweet boy mentally impared.  He wasn't supposed to live to age 6.  There were other children who had the surgery around the same time as Tommy.  They all died years ago.  Tommy was so lucky.  He has been around.  He loves to eat lunch out.  Go see all movies as soon as they come out.  He was looking forward to seeing SAW 3 next weekend.  Tomorrow is his birthday.  He will be 32.  This morning he woke up not feeling well.  They ended up rushing him to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation by ambulance.  Apparently his tumor ruptured.  They have stabilized him but he is not expected to live long...hours...days...maybe weeks.  He is such a smart boy.  He loved his two little nephews that were born this summer.  He played the mobile over the crib and talked to them.  He is going to teach them all about Star Wars and Star Trek.

Back on track though.  1 hour cardio 30 minutes weights.  I am either going to run or go to spinning class int he morning.  I am thinking I'll be running - outside."

"event","I am always wishing the Sundays would last longer...I haven't done much today...church, grocery store, gym, cooked dinner, cleaned kitchen floor...now I am wanting to snack.  Bad Michi...no snacking

I hit the gym and did about 50 minutes on the elliptical machine.  So far for July I am 8/27 on workouts. Whoohooo!

I have 3 weeks until hard core training for the Columbus Half Marathon.  I am working on getting my baseline from 3-4 miles up to 5-6 miles.  I think that will be easier for me in the long run!  No pun intended"

"event","So, I get dressed in my little gray capri pants and hot pink top and go to the gym for some running time.  I ran 6 miles in 1 hour 4 minutes.  Well, I looked in the mirror afterwards and it looked like I had peed my pants.  I know how gross.  So, today's thought is no light colored pants during a hard workout!"

Goal: To finish in 40 minutes 

Woke up in the middle of the night to horrible storms...I don't run outside in the rain so this could be 'fun' 

Anyway, picked up my friend at 8:15 and we headed up to the race. It was packed. It was supposed to start at 8:45 but so many people were signing up late that they postponed the start. I was really nervous about running with very wet roads. Gun went off and I started very timidly. First mile under 10 minutes...Cool feeling good and holding back. Mile 2 was at 18 minutes...still felt like I was holding back. Began hill climb (nothing like the hill in the Pig) started to feel comfortable with the wet road and began passing people. Mile 3 beginning to wish it would rain. The humidity was bad. Caught up to my friend's daughter. She and I decided to sprint the last half a mile. I 'let' her finish in front of me. She was so excited. I about died when the time said 39:15. I really wish I would have started my Garmin at the actual start line so I would know my real time. I started pretty far back. Oh well, it was a PR for me(even with the rain) First race where I hadn't thought I really could have done better. I didn't stay for the awards. I stopped at the store and got coffee and am now going to head to take a shower."

Okay, so I got off work and in an effort to workout 27/31 I headed my arse to the gym.  

Sweated out 4 miles.  Then chatted with T for a bit.  Her hubby is running the race tomorrow but she is too chicken to do it.  She claims she is too out of shape.  HA!

I picked up my number for tomorrow 157.  I am hoping to finish in 40 minutes...10 minute mile.  I 'should' be able to do that.

I really want a glass of wine or a Gimlet...but alas no drinkie, drinkie for me...tomorrow is a definite."

"event","okay, so I decided that I am going to workout 27 of 31 days in July.  I have no excuses...will get it in somehow!

For day two I went to the park and ran.  I don't know my time as I kept running into people I knew.  I only actually stopped once.  

Training for the half starts full-force on July 24."

"event","Well, it has been a crazy week...gym is still there.  Actually I need to get my ass dressed and there now..but I'll blog first.  My boss is moving to Tennessee in six weeks, so that makes those who are left very nervous.  Who knows who will end up in his place.  That said more effort is gong into moving to Cinci.

Workout wise, gym lots...been doing double spinning classes.  Heading to one now.  I am using the spinning as cross training.  So run, spin and elliptical.  Then naturally free weights.

Firecracker 4 is on Tuesday.  I am hoping for low humidity and cooler temps.  yeah right!

Okay...need to get dressed for gym time."

"event","So, it is Sunday night.  I went to church at 12:30.  It was the last mass that Fr. Matthew had before he moves to his new parish.  I am so sad to see him go.  We found out today that we have a new Associate Pastor named Fr. Matthew.  Hopefully he will be able to partially fill The first Fr. Matthew's shoes.

Got my new blinds for the computer room.  They look very nice.

Just got back from an easy run.  Got in another 3 today.  Gotta log those miles."

"event","So, I got the bright idea to run to the park to run.  I added an additional mile to my run.  It wasn't too bad except I forgot I would have to run on the busiest road.  I had lots of people honking and yelling lewd comments.  Real nice.  I ran 4.5 miles, I am on my way to building up distance.  Legs feel good so far today.  Meeting my friend at Chick-fil-A for lunch....do you think I can give up the waffle fries today???

Today is a DOR.  It is much needed.  Tomorrow is spinning, Friday is running."

"event","I started running almost 2 years ago in July.  I began by using the Couch to 5k program from coolrunning.com.  It is a great program.  I highly recommend it.  The first race I ran was that October at Thomas More College - my parent's alma mater and my baby brother's college.  I came in first for my age group.  I was hooked.  I got the bright idea to run a half marathon.  I decided to run the Flying Pig Half on May 1, 2005.  I trained hard and finished at 2 hours and 35 minutes.  Not bad for a first half.  I decided the moment I was finished to run again next year.  I wanted to finish in 2 hours even.  I trained hard, but not hard enough.  I finished the Pig at 2 hours and 26 minutes.  I have signed up for several races this summer to culminate with the Columbus Half Marathon on October 15th in Columbus, Ohio.

I ran a 5k on June 8 in 28 minutes.  I have a race scheduled for June 24, July 4 and July 8.  Gotta get the speed going."

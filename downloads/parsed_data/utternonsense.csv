that just burn off into the future in
the highest gear possible.

No-one has time to stop, to think.
We are showered with new amazing
washing powders, wonderful ways to
stop smoking and a shampoo that's
better than all the rest because...

In the meantime, people die.
Individuals just like you and me,
die from wars, starvation and drugs.
The bigger part of mankind is
fighting to stay alive. The other
part worries about how they look,
their car and where to spend their
vacation next year.

What have you done to earn a better
life than millions of starving,
suffering, dying?"

"event","Bonjour mon ami...
 
Today, I finally got my car back. As for tomorrow, I will have to get the bubble fixed in the tire.
I came to a rather horrific realization this past week. The realization itself wasn't all that horrific but the consequences of it were. 
Fundamentally, I need to go on pills. The reason for my conjecture is: I am not as hyper on them and I can think as well, and I can have an intelligent conversation. The reason why I know this is...because I took two valiums to go to bed. When I was trying to fall asleep I had the most witty conversation to myself, and I wasn't all that hyper.
Quite frankly I just need something to calm me down as well as something to help me think better...because I can't think when I am hyper, and I am hyper 90% of the day. I am not that intelligent but hey! perhaps the pills will help me concentrate.
 
Digressing...
 
Okay back on the subject of: ""today""
I went to Dan and Dave's (twins) house.
Then a bunch of us decided to go to banana Joe's. I was a little apprehensive at first...reason why: I don't like places that have a lot of people in it all bunched up. I don't like cluttered places. So, I decided to go... So we get there and the place was packed. Once I got in I saw: Megan, Casey and Rob. They were leaving...I said hello...they were shocked that I actually went. Okay, back on the topic... I didn't really dance well, I didn't dance. It's not really my atmosphere. The only cool part about it was: The loud music and the disco balls that flash and the fake snow... It felt cool. Like I was free or something; uncanny I suppose. 
My neck, my back, lick my pussy and my crack. ( I wonder if I am allowed to say that?) 
People that went: Jay, Kyle, Jackie, Brianne, Eric, Dan, Dave, Krystal, Craig, Shannon, and Mike (me). Although, Dave, Krystal, Craig, and Shannon didn't want to wait in line so the left.

I'm euphoric. Cass and I became friends once again :) I'm sorry for my blunders... ;)

Dear Heavenly Father,

I come to you with all my sins, my burden and addictions. Wash me in the precious blood that Jesus shed for me when He died on the cross. Break the chains of sin and Satan in my life and family. I surrender to you and I want to be yours; spirit, soul and body, for time and eternity. I put my faith in you alone, Lord Jesus Christ. You are the only begotten Son of the Living God. I believe with my heart what I now confess with my mouth: You are my Savior, Lord and God. My sins are now forgiven and I have been ""born-again!"" Old things have passed away and I am a new creation in Christ Jesus. I am a child of God. I believe it and I receive it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. AMEN.   

Well, I am going to bed now goodnight.

Hopefully someone will reply to this...

Until next time..."

"event","Hello, I am summoning myself to write in this journal; in fact I have nothing to talk about.
 
Well, I stayed home this evening. The car is in the shop.
We will get it back in a few days, like it matters anyway it has to go into another shop. I can't wait for Dorney Park!
It's right around the corner. My conjecture is that: I will have to go on one roller coaster. I am undoubtedly afraid of them. 
 
I wish my stock would go up...I had it for: 2-3 years. At one point I could have pulled out and made $5,000.00 but I didn't. I believe if it went up once again I will pull out...So I can have the perpetual smile that I need in life. It's highly implausible that it will go up. I am such a sap ... I should have pulled out. CONFOUND IT. I need money. My father wants me to get a job...but...eh...work...
My vanity bristles at the thought of a job...Perhaps I will get a job at the end of the summer. Yes, I am saying that...well actually I am typing that. If you didn't know I am taking a year off then I will attend college. Hopefully, I will be very steadfast. I am afraid that I will fail college. I guess I am apprehensive about everything these days. 
 
I am very depressed lately. I don't know why! I am questioning if I should live or not. I guess it's the systematic thoughts. I don't know why...but, I can't think of anything good right now.
I guess I am apprehensive about growing up...I don't want to grow up. I don't what to pay bills and what not. I miss my old life.
Having fun, going out to dinner a few times a week. Driving in extravagant cars and what not. I miss my uncle and cousins utterly. I guess I expect too much out of life. I wish I had money or brains for that matter I wish I was good looking I wish and I wish. 
Hopefully when I get my car I will be somewhat euphoric. I guess it is merely my mental alienation. Quite frankly I wish I can have a better life. why must I live this one...

Some people just don't know what I go through on a daily basis.

""until next time quote me never more""

Sorry I am not fixing mistakes; paraphrase

Why must I live?"

Nothing much! How about you?
Feels like I am writing a note...well, in a way I am.
 
I haven't been writing to you fine people lately...I have nothing to talk about nothing has been going on in my life.
I guess I have my ups and downs in life. I can be euphoric one day and then next dysphoric,. The euphoria can even last a week or two or even longer it all depends on what happens to me.
Perhaps It's mental alienation or perhaps even hypochondriasis...
I got in to a blatant fight with one of my best-friends yesterday. Maybe it was for the best; happenstance.
My relationship with her is very much a labor of love. Occasionally, with a heavy emphasis on the labor side of things. 
And I guess it's something worth leaving behind...
 
Okay moving on...
 
I'm going to Dave's house tonight.
I believe all of us may go camping tomorrow...
I have to attend a graduation party tomorrow; Jen's.
I am going to Dorney Park on the 10th day of Aug."

Your essence is like the Ocean,
     Your Aura, that of the Moon.
Sultriness as fire, 
     Beauty like the dove's croon.

Static electricity 
     rays from inside, 
Mind ever ebbing,
     Poetry, like the tide.

Love so fragile and 
     innocent,
Heart from the skies,
     Heaven-sent.

Spirit, transcendental
     Eternity;
Texture, neither touched,
     Nor for eye to see.

Air, Sea and firmament
     Fall to your Grace,
Whilst angels amongst us
     Whisper your Praise.

With mingled psalms
     They pour forth their alms,
As they bring exultation
     To your Face.

The sadness of life
The change of our lives and not knowing what to do 
The loss I feel is mine alone
You shall live on
You did this to me
You tore my heart apart
You were my whole life 
I shall not live any longer without you
Do not cry for me you decided to move on
Live your dreams
There is nothing left here for me
I stand here alone
I will die alone
This is good-bye
Do not weep for I am not immortal...

"event","Before you read this: I wrote this about a year ago. I wasn't that good of a writer then. As I read it now I see a lot of mistakes, and I won't paraphrase it because it came from the heart.

 
Kurt,
                    Today for life on earth is past, a day I would not like to relive, it was a very sad day for all of us, the day you left us all (Oct 19th 1998). I remember the day like it was no tomorrow, the day I would remember for the rest of my life, the day that my COUSIN died, the day I lost my best-friend. I thought of all the yesterdays, the good ones and the bad, I thought of all the love we shared, and all the fun we had. If I could relive a few years ago just even for a while, I'd say good-bye and maybe see you smile. But as I turned to walk away a tear fell from my eye, for all life, I'd always thought, I didn't want you to die, you had so much to live for, so much yet to do, it seemed almost impossible, that I was leaving you.

                    I didn't think you would ever die that's why I didn't come to see you, that weekend before you died, I thought you were strong and I thought you would make it through but you didn't, and I'm still mad at myself that I didn't come to see you that weekend. I was just sick of coming back and fourth every week and I really thought you would make it. I wish I could have said good-bye to you. I remember the last few days I was with you, the day of the spit-ball fight with you and Todd, the day we watched South-Park, and all the video games we played, all the wrestlers you had. As I look back on all that's happened growing up, growing together with you I look back on those days, I really realize how much I truly miss you and how much I truly love you. The past may be gone forever, and what the future holds, our today's make the memories of tomorrow.

                   I will never forget you as long as I live, you will stay in my heart for the rest of my life. Someday we will be together once again up in heaven where we all belong. Till then I will always talk about you, when you died I won't let the memories die with you the memories should live on and be remembered. I will never forget about you, I know how much you love me, as much as I love you, and each time you think of me, I know you'll miss me too. I might miss come tomorrow, I thought of you, and when I did. My heart was filled with sorrow. But you have been so faithful, so trusting and so true. Though there were times you did some things you knew you shouldn't do, except you have been forgiven and now at last you're free. So won't you take my hand and share my life with me? Except when tomorrow starts without you Kurt, don't think we're far apart, for every-time you think of me, you're right here in my heart.

            As I sit here through my tears I look back on all the years. If you were alive today you would see how everything has changed, a lot changed for the good, a lot change for the worse. I hardly even see your brother and sister anymore let alone your mother and your father. I would like to see them but we never keep in touch. And I see your brother getting sicker as time goes by and I am not there for him like I was with you, I wish I was with him more but we don't keep in touch.

Now Kurt its time to say bye, I will not say good-bye because good-bye means I might never see you again, well I can say see you later cause I know Ill see you in heaven. :)

I love you and I miss you 

From your cousin Michael Dyson.

Ps: Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road. 
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. 
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why. 
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time. 
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. 
I hope you had the time of your life. So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind. Hang it on a shelf of good health and good time. 
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial. For what it's worth, it was worth all the while. I hope you had the time of your life."

I just got back from senior week a few days ago.
I had a lot of fun. There were times when it was boring then there were times when it was fun. All I spent was $103 or $107 dollars for the whole vacation. I know what you're thinking...Yes, I am very frugal.
That was including: room, gas, and food! I stayed at a friends hotel for $20 (I just had to give them money for food.) A lot of people drank and smoked but not I ... I wasn't going to summon myself to consume alcoholic beverages and then end up with a heavy-duty katzenjammer the following day.

Bob Dylan in 1963 wrote and sang ""The Times They Are-A-Changing."" He was right!!! They've changed and times will continue to change. You will have to accept change and acknowledge diversity if you are going to be happy in the years ahead. We must learn to work together and appreciate each other's differences: black or white, Judea-Christian or Atheist.
 
Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling five balls in the air. You name them: work, family, health, friends, and spirit -- and you're keeping all--of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But, the other four balls: family, health, friends, and spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.
There will be times when each of you will confront adversity. Times when you will find it difficult to keep those balls in the air. It is those times that you must fight with integrity. Integrity that is based on personal principles. 
 
Empower yourself to be yourself because, in the words of Sweet Honey in the
Rock, ""we are the people we've been waiting for.""  We are the people who
are going to make the world the place in which we want to live.  Not them.
Not they. You and I.  We are the people who can see to it that the well
being of all of our communities' members is insured, and that injustices
are identified and addressed.  Not them, not they.  You and I.  We can see
to it that in this great democracy of ours, the wishes of the majority are
carried out, but the tyranny of the majority is fought, if needs be, tooth
and nail.  Not them, not they.  You and I.

To everyone: I thank you heartily for everything. I know all of you will be very successful in life. All of you are extraordinary people. Live you life to the fullest that you can...never give up...follow your heart, stand up for that in which you believe and keep learning as you go. Never let your dreams go...Mick Jagger once said in one of his songs: and I quote ""lose your dreams, and you will lose your mind."" (Ruby Tuesday)
I would like to express my gratitude:        
for you, for the time you've given me, 
and the person you are! 

As for friendship and comradery, well that's another matter.  

I hope you all had the time of your life, as did I...

Then we meet up with: Tim, Eric, Craig, Steve, and two other kids I don't know... We're sleeping at their place.
 
I went up to Walmart to get a phone-cord for my father. I went to pay for it, and I gave them the credit-card and she goes: ""how do I know if this is you?"" ""where's your ID?"" Me: "" it's in my car."" ""call my father."" So she calls my father. Hello this is Walmart what is your last name? My father says: ""DYSON"" ""what does your son look like?"" (how is this relevant)? Dad: ""he's my son."" ""blonde hair, blue eyes, 5'9."" Then my father said just forget about it.
How utterly absurd was that!!! Ever since I turned 18 everyone asks me for ID... And I am basically compelled to give it to them. I have no choice.

How shall I start this? Well, I abhor my brother. Yes, I do. Quite frankly, I can't take his adolescent nonsense any longer Picture this: My kitchen a few days ago: I was in my kitchen minding my own business when my brother says: ""Mike, I am going to kill dad, and frame you, for murder."" Mike: ""John, shut the fuck up."" John: ""Mike, no one likes you everyone hates you in this family, so they will say you did it."" Mike: ""Father, did you hear that?"" Father: ""That is the 14 year old in him."" (May I add he is 21 going to be 22 years of age in AUG.) Now, dont you agree with me about this adolescent nonsense? Some times I just feel like saying: ""John, multiply it by infinity take it to the depth of forever, and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.""  My brother, and I are very diverse from one another. He likes drugs, I don't. He'll sit there and badger me about nothing (I'm going to emphasize the word nothing.)  I guess you can say he is: ""Irreverent as he is absurd."" I bet a lot of you are appalled? I assume. I have to play it very nonchalant when I am around him. He can be so crass at times.

1. water noises - waves, gull squawks, etc 
2. warm, salty-smelling air 
3. a place to sit, near 1. and 2., to read&nbsp;
4. sand to bury my feet in
5. a nearby bar (or similar) blasting great music

and I need it all really close to my house so I can go there after work, today. 

Thoughts, anyone?&nbsp;"

I like who I am right now, and getting *here* took walking through all of the *theres* that might could be seen as regrettable actions or decisions or consequences or what have you. There are definitely lessons that I wished I'd learned more quickly, so I could've spent less time in the various hells that I've created for myself - so maybe my only regret is that I have a stubborn streak a mile wide and an unwillingness to see.&nbsp;<br /><br />[3] when is the last time you were played so hard you were completely exhausted (mentally, physically, emotionally) afterward?&nbsp;<br /><br />Holli's gotten quite expert at ""breaking me,"" so nearly every time we play, I get to that beautiful magical point where I'm just used up. I love the peace that comes with that - I love when those voices in my head that are always screaming for *more* get fulfilled and quieted.&nbsp;<br /><br />[4] is kink a part of your everyday life or mostly a once in a while treat?<br /><br />Hmm.... Today, it's more like a treat.&nbsp; There have been points in my life (relatively recently, even) when it's more of a 24/7 presence, and I hope to get there again, but my kinks are so tied up (heh.) in... you know... the rest of what's going on in my emotional landscape, I guess... that I end up pulling back and protecting myself from that intimacy that that 24/7-ness requires.<br /><br />[5] what are you most proud of accomplishing in your life?<br /><br />I've raised a pretty wonderful kid.&nbsp; She's bright and funny; she's fairly self-aware; she's wise in many ways but has a wonderful silliness and simplicity, too.&nbsp; I probably really shouldn't take credit for that - she's been her own person for many many&nbsp;years (her incredible stubbornness didn't fall far from the proverbial tree), but it's absolutely been my greatest joy to say that she's mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>"

If you ever want to see your pink-lidded Tupperware bowl and your fork alive again, you must place&nbsp;vast quantities&nbsp;of dried peas and wasabi peas in a plain brown bag and&nbsp;deliver them&nbsp;to my door.
You have 24 hours, only - or your pink lid will begin its new life as a kitty litter box liner.

"event","My best friend in college was this guy named Jeff.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'd also gone to high school with him, but didn't really know him so well there - we ran with different packs, but we'd both written for the lit mag and our groups intersected enough that we knew *of* each other even though we didn't really know each other.&nbsp; I knew he'd gone to the prom with the high school (shhhh) lesbian couple, but everyone knew that.
As my parents drove around the dorm quad to drop me off at college, Jeff was quite literally the first person I saw on campus that first day.
We saw movies together.&nbsp; Thousands of movies, I'd guess.&nbsp; We'd go and sit in the theatres all day - we'd buy a ticket for a matinee and just stay all day and see everything.&nbsp; And we went to all of the drive-ins, before they all closed down.&nbsp; Jeff shared my adoration of B horror movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the&nbsp;best Christmas presents I ever got was the year he found me a rare copy of ""Night of the Bloody Apes.""
We spent untold hours in the 24-hour Krispy Kreme, talking late into the night over bad coffee, discussing everything and more.&nbsp; He was the first person I ever trusted with *me,* even the prickly scary weird parts that I'd always kept hidden.&nbsp; He was the first person I ever shared my ""real"" writing with, and the only person that's ever read some of it.
He dropped out of school after first semester.&nbsp; I don't know that he ever went to class, at all.
We tried to date, twice.
The first time was just after his divorce.&nbsp; I was still in college, and he'd moved to Atlanta, and it just stunk.&nbsp; The second time was just after my divorce.&nbsp; He was living in NYC, working for Playboy and writing for a couple of entertainment-type weeklies, and Birmingham was just too far away, both physically and idealistically, and our schedules and&nbsp;philosophy never really clicked.&nbsp; I think I was ""safe"" - the girl back home.&nbsp; Ballast of some sort, against the tide of debauchery that was the rest of his day.&nbsp; Again, it stunk.
Anyhow, I moved up here, and looked him up.&nbsp; Easy enough - he's still writing, and has a blog.&nbsp; I wrote yesterday, offering to meet him for coffee, hoping to catch a movie and maybe catch up, hoping to find the connection we'd had all those years ago.
He wrote back today, telling me that there's no need to catch up.
I hate being dismissed so easily."

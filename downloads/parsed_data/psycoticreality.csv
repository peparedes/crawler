Anyway, i saw Star Wars TWICE yesterday.  Yup, i rule at being a dork.  1st time was with <lj user=""thisisnotcamden""> and we spazzed and OMGed the whole thing and it was all fun.  And we were in the second row and almost broke our necks.  And then i saw it a second time with my WHOLE family.  So it was me, my dad, mom, and 2 little sisters sitting there (FRONT row this time, hells yeah.  ONLY place with 5 seats in a row) But that time i didn't have a Casbah to spaz to so i spazzed to my little sister who isn't a Star Wars fan at all, and to myself.  And the guy sitting next to me thought i was mental.  (And he was SO gay, omg.  He was wearing nail polish and his friend kept touching his knee)  But that was still really fun.  And the crowd was better because they spazzed at all the proper places.  

And then i watched SNL to see Coldplay, and that was pretty good but i was falling asleep."

But it was crazy because i have 3 speakers, 2 on top and 1 under my desk, the 2 on top play mostly the vocals and guitar and the one underneath plays mostly bass and a bit of drums.  So it felt like i was sitting in a bass amp or something.  But i didn't realise it was so long so after while i was just like, falling asleep and i thought my head might explode from the bassness.  And this morning i woke up with a really bad headache.  But it was still nice.  And my alarm played a weird song this morning, it wasn't Don't Stop Believing and i was sad. The end.  And i'm seeing Star Wars in an hour-ish."

But on the minus side i think my dad threw away my lightsaber.  

So yesterday spent ages learning CPR and First Aid and so now i'm certified and i can graduate high school. 

Also i went to <lj user=""ratherblank"">'s house and watched Star Wars.  I saw the end of Attack of the Clones and then the good ones.  It was so fun, we left at almost 1ish in the morning.  And it was just crazy fun because it was a bunch of ""former"" Star Wars freak remembering why we love the movies so much.  I want Luke Skywalker, he's so adorable.  And we were mental.  We were making bad puns and dirty jokes and basically ruining our childhood movies.  because we were completely mental by the end of the night.  By the middle of it, actually. Or possibly the begining.

best Quotes of the night:
""What, is he jealous because Luke's lightsaber is bigger?""

-""What happens if you accidentally open the lightsaber the wrong way?""
-""I guess thats how you tell whether or not you're <i>cut out</i> to be a Jedi"""

Even when I Get Along comes on and i try to skip past the Fuck 'em part by turning down the volume all the way and then turning it back up except i missed and the Fuck 'em part came on really loud.  

And if i get Coldplay tickets my dad is driving me up to San Fransisco (because he has to be the one to pick up the tickets), going and watching some random movie with the concert is going on, than driving us home.  

Yeah..... that's all."

My parents are going mental spazoid about college.  I'm frightened and i don't want to go to college anymore.  They're making me take summer school or something like it just so it'll look like i did something over the summer.  They've even gone so far as to schedule a meeting with a college counselor in monday.  They're severely misinformed if they think i'm going.  Hooray for Palo Alto Cafe for hours.  I've even gone so far as to e-mail my advisor to ask her to talk to my parents or something to get them to stop doing this. Hopefull she'll get the message.

I've been trying to get Common People to be the most played song.  So i've been listening to it non-stop for the past week basically.  And it's gone from like, 25th to 2nd.  2 more times until it's tied for first with lover i don't have to love.   I've been doing the Common People dance every time too.  I'm such a dork."

"event","Ok for french we have to make a video of us doing a french cooking show.  So me and Molly and Katie made a cake.  And i just finished editing it and it's the funniest thing i've ever seen in my entire life.  Like. for example, i tried to put a photo of the cake at the end with the words ""Tres beau gateau"" over it.  In one of the bloopers the camera was accidentally zoomed up really close on molly's and my boobs.  And the stupid movie editing thing decided to put the words over that.  So now it looks like i'm calling my boobs ""very good cake""

But the video features the music stylings of Franz, Coldplay and the Arctic Monkey's so that makes it all better. 

Actually i think i'll just upload the video for you to watch:

I just have to get tickets now.  Eek.  I'm afraid i won't get tickets and then i'll die.  Woe. This is why i'm not spazzing.  Because if i spaz i definitely won't get tickets.

Actually remembered to bring cd's for people today.  Go me.  Is it bad that seeing the Bob-kid makes my day?

i got Molly into Pulp.  More specifically, Common People.  She does the dance with me.  So now i don't look like such a freak doing it by myself.  

The Borders people noticed that i go in there WAY too much so i got added to their e-mailing list.  I don't even like Borders.  Stupid overpriced cd's.  And they have a crap selection too."

I went to the Palo Alto Cafe today.  It's where all the geeky old people hang out with their computers.  I watched them for ages.  While drinking a huge Chai.  Then i walked home with a bagel.  And i passed this little girl, probably about 11, who looked really sad.  So i told her that her shirt was really cute.  And she got this HUGE smile on her face and i felt happy."

And i'm trying to get my thoughts organized on paper, and i tried on lj.  It's not really working.  I just want to watch people.  And talk to them.  Just, do somthing.  And i know i already made a post about that.  But i tried to describe how i was feeling to my mom and i started crying.  I don't know why.  It just feels like everything i'm doing is a waste of time.  So now my mom thinks there's somthing wrong with me.  And maybe there is.  I could barely go to school.  Stepping into the classroom was painful.  Getting off the shuttle was painful (literally, i was kinda stuck).  Getting on the shuttle was painful. 

But now i'm wondering, what do you think the meaning of life is, and more importantly, why?  I asked my family.  Dad, true to his geekiness said 42.  Mom said love because that's what the Beatles sang about and what separates us from animals and it's what Jesus taught.  7 year old sister said living.  But i'm wondering, what do YOU think?"

Hi new people, by the way. 

-Basics: name is Joanna (wow this is boring already), grade 10 in school, i live in a small town called Palo Alto and i go to school literally across the street from Stanford University.  I also live fairly close to San Fransisco, although i don't really go there often. I'm 15, 16 in September.  

-Posts: All right basically i'm obsessive about everything.  I mostly talk about Franz Ferdinand.  But also The Libertines, and er, that's it really.  But i also make random posts about whats going on in my life.  Sometimes these end up being boring and i go on for ages about stuff that doesn't need going on about.  I ride horses, so i'll somtimes talk about that but mostly people don't know 1 end of a horse from the other.  I'm also on the track on Croos Country teams, so if i'm bitching bout being sore or someone named Jones, thats just runnning.  I'm also in Girl Scouts, and we went to london so if i ever make a post saying ""OMG I MISS LONDON LETS GO THERE IN A BOXXX"" thats what that is about. 

-Stuff i commonly refer to: Paly= my school, The Shuttle- a free shuttle that is overly crowded usually that i have to take to school, Savanna- friend since a long time.  Noa and Elizabeth- Track team people.  Wesley- <lj user=""ratherblank""> and possibly the coolest person ever.  Cas, Casbah, Camden, Cami- <lj user=""thisisnotcamden"">, Lia- girl scout person, River/Craig/Belle/my pony/my horsie- horses that i ride/rode, not actually mine.  Unless of course it's Craig- a man whore we stalked in Brighton

That's me in a nutchell basically.  Wow, thats a long post."

"event","So there's a kid who goes to my school who looke like Bob.  I call him the bob kid, as i don't know his realy name. Well i just told him that he looks like Bob.  Actually he doesn't know who Franz Ferdinand is.  But he was all adorable and Bobbish.  Actually his response was:
""Well, i'd always thought that i'd look like Finch from American Pie if i dyed my hair dark, i never knew that i look like a bassist.""
So he wasn't entirely creeped out by me.  (Unlike the Jarvis Cocker lady)
(Also he said ""See you later"" which very nearly made me spaz.  Because of the i'm your villian song)

I decided that i really like the Arctic Monkeys.  I only have 4 songs though.  I want more.  

Track meet tomorrow.  i'm going to die.  But i say that everytime so i won't bore you with that.  

I'm going to go practise my bass.  Goal is to play until it hurts too much to.  Or until my fingers bleed.  Cuz how cool would that be?

"event","We learned how to put on condoms in school today.  No, don't run away, that's not what the whole post is going to be about.  But we did.  With the banana and everything.  I mean i have enough trouble eating bananas before that... Both girl and guy condoms.  I'm frightened of the girl condom though.  They also told us to use lots of lube.  So the condom won't break.  Mind you, my brain was thinking of the Libertines at that moment so it gave me weird thoughts.

Speaking of the Libertines, i told everyone i came in contact with about Pete&Carl.  I'm sure they all wanted to kill me by the end of the day.  Oh well. 

I felt guilty so i went to Borders and bought Up The Bracket (FINALLY). When i went to pay the following conversation happened:

Guy:""Oh the Libertines huh?  They're not really a band anymore though.""
Me:""Actually Pete and Carl talked last night for the first time in 10 months.  And now they don't hate eachother anymore.""
Guy: ""Well they didn't really hate eachother...""
Me: ""Carl totally has a reason to hate Pete though, considering that he broke into Carl's flat and stole Carl's guitars for drug money"" 
Guy: *gives me a weird look*""Alright, alright.  Enjoy you're cd.""

And of course i'm spazzing this whole time because it's a guy who knows the Libertines.  

Sonce monday was so happy i made happy cookies.  They say ""Pete <3 Carl"" and ""Oasis!"" and stuff like that.  Hooray for procrastination. I took pictures.  I'll try to post them here.

"event","Went to Hana's 16th birthday party.  It was actually fun.  I was 2 hours late and all, but it was fine.  There was a hot guy there but Molly was already totes flirting with him.  So i just hit on Michelle.  We were having a contest to see who could be the most lesbian without getting creeped out.  (As we are prone to do).  Arunima was getting all pissy with us.  But it was fun.  Because Michelle is so amazingly straight so all she would do is lick her lips and wink at me while i licked her nose (on accident actually) and grabbed her ass, and more actually.  They decided i was more hardcore.  (Their word, not mine.  I laughed for about 20 minutes when they said that) So apparently now i'm a hardcore lesbian.  

I'm being overcome with musicwhoriness.  And i feel like i should practise my bass.  I'll try to do both at the same time."

But now i'm bored.  I want to hang out with someone.  But it's after 9.  I'll just go watch t.v. and then sleep.  

I hate it when people laugh at me.  I know you're supposed to be able to laugh at yourself and yadda yadda yadda but no.  And it's crazy, because being laughed at is something that doesn't bothere a lot of people.  But it makes me feel about {} this big.  And it's crap.  And i can't really fit the way i'm feeling into words right now. 

My parents said i can go see Oasis.  Yay.  I'm actually happy about this.  It just doesn't seem like it. 

I got so pissed off at Cohen i thought i was going to start crying.  This is so weird, how i'm feeling right now.  I'd blame it on PMS but i know it's not.  And i should feel happy but i don't and i don't know why.  I'm just so mood swingy.  I think there's something seriously wrong with me.  And i feel like i'm going to start crying now and i have no idea why.  God, what's wrong with me?"

But i really wanted to listen to Lover I Dont Have To Love and i didn't have it so i went through Conor Oberst withdrawl.  So i got I'm Your villian stuck in my head.  Because like LiDHtL it's slightly dirty and not very straight.  

I was watching Lost but it was a re-run so i switched it to Silence of the Lambs.  But i'm not watching it anymore.  Doesn't seem too scary to me.  My mom got all pissy though.  Because ages a go she went with my dad to see it in theaters.  Although somehow they saw it accidentally.  It scared the crap out of my mom.  So much so that she made my dad go out and buy motion sensored outside lights for the house.  And then she repressed the memory for 10 years.

It's a nice sort of holiday though, i'm just zoning out through all my classes so while i'm not learning anything, i'm also not bored. 

But i did flip off Ms. Gibson, my dance teacher.  Because she was glaring at me b/c i wasn't doing her back stretch b/c i don't want to fuck up my back again.  So then i was taling to Hana later and she comes over and is all ""Make sure tehre's space between you"" and is all bitchy about it so when she turns around i flip her off.  But i forget that there are MIRRORS ON THE WALLS.  So according to Lisa she totally saw.  She didn't say anything though.  But i've just murdered my Dance grade.  

the moral of this story? DON'T FLIP OFF TEACHERS!!!!!!

And it's not going to get harder beSo i got mad at her and now i'm listening to Bright Eyes to make myself feel better. 

Oh crap, i've still got Casbah's Pixies cd. 

AND my mom got mad at me for ""scavenging"".  IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT I'M HUNGRY. And then she kept trying to make me eggs and WHY IS SHE SO ANNOYING.  All right.  I'm done possibly.  

I think i'll go to bed.  Why am i so mood swingy? i was fine 2 seconds a go.  

My dad thinks Cas is mental because it's so OBVIOUSLY Paul singing.  And i know i'm being annoying for not dropping this.  But i don't care.  His yelling voice sounds like his talking voice.  AND Helter Skelter sounds nothing like Twist and Shout.  Which i actually have on my iPod now that i've checked.

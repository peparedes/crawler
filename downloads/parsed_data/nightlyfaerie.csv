"event","I'm at work on the internet and Rachel is visiting me. Since I work for the Literacy Depot which is both state and federally funded, feel comforted that your tax dollars are going to good use. Anyways, I only created this journal to look at Rachel's and am only posting so she can comment. So its back to surfing the internet on the Library's computers. Another day, another 67 cents after taxes."

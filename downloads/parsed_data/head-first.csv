"event","should get punched in the fucking face. and i think im the girl to do it. god it would make my life so much better.


also my boss is a bitch i think her goal in life aside from not having cancer for a second time around is to make me want to blow my effing brain out of my skull....or something. i'll just give you an example of what i deal with on a day to day basis. im sick and instead of calling in sick and telling her to kiss my ass i come in...im FIVE minutes late.this is the conversation:
her:""why are you late""
me:""because im sick and i just couldnt get out of bed im sorry""
(this is where i almost threw my can of soup at her and would have told her to fuck off)
her:""then why are you here""
what?! are you kidding me i get my sick ass out of bed and you couldnt even say oh i dont know thanks or im sorry you're sick its okay that you were late try not to do it again....

so when someone is sick the snese able thing is to let them leave as soon as possible right? well not for me when i sick mary my boss thinks it a good idea to keep me there longer. i sorta hate my job."

this is how the itchy layering goes:
gauze pad
the guaze warp stuff
the itchy wool type arm splint(which is cutting into random parts of my arm sorta defeting its purpose...to protect my cut and so i cant use my thumb. i just really hate it.)
ace bandage 

all itchy all uncomfortable.
then the antibiotic which im no good at remembering to take.

in all honesty i'm not sure if we should be freinds. all you do is make me feel horrible about myself. you make fun of everything i do, wear,say. it doesnt really mater what it is you make fun. and saying that i dont respect my parents is crossing the line and saying that your kid will never be like me. to be honest im a damn good kid. the only thing that i ever did that my mom didnt want to me to was stay out late. you would only be so lucky to have a child like me.

there are reasons why i love you. you call in the middle of the day on a random day to tell my answering machine that you miss and love me. that we need to hang out soon listening to you and cracking up while im frosting a cake that i had just baked. i can call you whenever im crying and you drop everything and run to me. and always you make me laugh. you give me adive even though i never listen and youre always right. ""its always easier to give an outsiders prepective."" we fight and break up but i know that you will always be mine. i love you c. and i miss you more. we have stopped hanging out because of stpid boys. stupid boys with floppy boy hair. lets run away together. 


i think its funny that you write stories about killing michael for your creative writing class. and that you worry if its ood enough to turn in. yes mister boy face it is good enough ot turn in. i also think its funny that you do care when i get mad about you not being able to go to bingo but you dont really care when i get mad at you for real things. you're silly. 


this morning at 7:15 in the a.m. my father tells me i need to get up (we were taking my car to the shop to get the breaks fixed and i have to have my car tomorow so t had to be in early so it would be done today) so i start getting up like right when he says this because he gets bitching when i dont but apparently this wasnt fast enough for him becasue this was the conversation that followed my movement. 
father:"" i meant now not this afternoon.""
me:"" im getting up."" 
father:"" do you have money to pay for it?""
me:"" no but you know what dont worry about it i will just get in a car wreck and die."" 
it was sooo wonderful. cates coming to get me."

"event","the night before last you called me your girlfriend...then quickly changed it to person i hang out with most. i know i got that silly goofy girl grin when you said that and my eyes went from directly where ever they were wondering to locked directly on yours. 

last night you told me that you had stopped messing around with other girls and somewhere along the line we got off track. i think you are by far the most confusing person on this planet. but i wont lie. i like it.

the night before last you told me you didnt know a god damn thing about me. did it ever occur to you that it was like that for a reason. i dont want you to know what i do when im alone i dont want anyone to do when im alone. im alone for a reason to do stuff that i do when im ...alone. i have reasons for you not knowing anythign about me. i think the question is why do you want to know about me?

you confuse me.

"event","i am so fucking sick of this town and everyone in it. i want to leave and be alone for awhile. 


so this place that melissa works. the only positions that are open make me even more sad then i was. i would be getting paid 50 cents less i would have to drive to moore and i would be working full time. but i guess a job is better than no job at all right? and the woman still has not called me back. ive called twice today and once yesterday and left two messages and melissa told her to call me. ths sucks. but i was thinking about how i was going t go to school in the city area so i guess moore would be okay. i just wish it was part time i would totally be down if it was part time. or if it was a dolllar more since im driving so far. oh well...."

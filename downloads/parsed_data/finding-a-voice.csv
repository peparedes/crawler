"event","Well, I haven't been here for ages. i was expecting that my account would have been shut down by now - luckily not - at least posting here will mean it stays open for a while.
  I would have posted before, but I really haven't had anything much to say. If I have a thought, I will let you know. ok?"

"event","I'm supposed to be looking for a job today. 

I've applied for a job folding cloth. The man told me it ""was a shit job, soul destroying and that i'd want to kill myself within two days of working there"". Doesn't matter though - I'd take the job...
   I've also applied to have my brain scanned, be a sperm donor, impersonate Sherlock Holmes, be a bouncer in Surrey, be a waiter in the Groucho Club. I will get none of these gimmicky jobs - but at least I gave it a shot, eh?
  I want to get money together in order to afford smoking, drinking, spending a summer in london, getting a ticket to leeds festival, etc. Not to mention going back to university in October. In some ways I'd rather stay at home in London and not go back to uni - it's better in lots of ways - but usually better if you've got money. 
  Oh well, York Uni it is. You've probably never been to York unless you are (a) old or (b) a tourist who likes old things. York is small. Most people say it is pretty, and i suppose it is pretty. But lots of things are pretty and nice to look at."

Erm, I'm new to this...I've never kept a diary before...could never be bothered....but this will improve my writing and will-power, won't it? 

Well, my name's Alex and I'm 20 (see how I'm slowly revealing fascinating information about my life). Stay tuned for more fascinating information."

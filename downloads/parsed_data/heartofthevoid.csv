"event","Whew!
 Kim's boss is going to co sign with me for the loan. This will enable us to pay 2 months rent and get caught up with things.
 We've been playing catch up since we moved in and it's been killing us. But now that problem will be solved.
So we get to keep the house and we get to stay together as a family.

On another note, Kim's daughter, Courtney, who lives with her dad, down in Griffin, will be moving in with us after she gets out of school. Kim and I are both VERY excited and can't wait. We'll now have both children with us! Let the headaches begin!!! LOL

Other than that, things are goin well.
Hey Bird!! If you're reading this, I'll drop you an email later! Been way too busy and tired from work to respond! Tell Kada Hey!!And I tell her I got me a fiesty smartass redneck too!

Ya'll take care!"

 We're still struggleing with bills and such but we're getting closer than ever before. I finally found that piece of the puzzle I've been missing.
 Her children love me and her folks and family think I'm the greatest. Matter of fact, her mom called me tonight to wish me a happy birthday and to see if I got my card and we talked for a while. Later, Kim commented that her mom talked to me longer than she did her! Just had to grin at that!
Work's going ok. Hitting the burn out zone though. Working 10-12 hour day plus the 1 1/2 hour ride to and from work is starting to get to me. I leave the house at 4:30am. Yuck!

 But other than that, doing good out here way out in Paulding county."

"event","Decided a couple of weeks ago that I would start drawing again.
 Now this may be a shock to some of you. Saying why haven't we seen your work before? Actually you have but it was my brush work. 

 What I do by drawing is what I call Animated Kanji.
 Now Kanji is the chinese or japanese symbols of a word. What I do is draw out the kanji of a certain word and give it the characteristics of the word.

 Example:Years ago I did a piece I gave away. Took me a month to finish it. It was called the 5 elemental dragons. What I did was draw the kanji for dragon and drew the kanji for the element above it. There are 5 elements: Earth, Wind, Fire, Water and the Void. I then colored and drew in aspects of the dragon's element.
 I've decided to start another one. I find it very relaxing and with my headphones one happen to fall into an almost zen like state. very relaxing.
 Brittany, Heath daughter, is absolutely mesmerized by my work. I'll have to make something for her for X-mas.
  As much as I'd like to write, seeing as how I have a great story brewing in my head, I've just got too much else running around in my head to write and I need a bit more think of my stories, Wolf in sheep's clothing and War of God and Man. The last one may get me burned at the stake as a heretic! LOL

 IN other news, the doctor released me back to full duty and I go into work tomorrow for my last day. Then it's Thanknsgiving here with one of my brothers and family. Then(sigh) Julie, Heath's wife conned Heath and I to get up well beofre the butt crack of dawn to go shopping on Black Friday. But as soon as I get back from that, it's load up my truck and head north. 
 Can't wait!!!"

 I am now ME again. But really what I mean by the Subject heading is that this Wolf will be migrating North back into the Atlanta Ga region. 
 That's right. You read that right. I'm coming back to the Atlanta region. I have a job waiting for me in Canton, well Holly Springs actually. I'll be working at Hydro-Chem, where because my welding experince doesn't apply, i'll be a shop helper starting out but they do offer classes in MIG and TIG welding, which I will take advantage of whole heartedly.
 I'll be making more than I am right now, working almost the same amount of hours. It looks like I'll be pulling a 56 work week. Not a problem for me! 
  However, I'll be staying in the Doulasville area and living there about. Yeah I know, the drive will most likely kill me but I've driven farther before for work. and with the hours I'll be working, I should miss the brunt of traffic.

  I'll be leaving just after Thanksgiving. This way I can spend the holiday with Heath and Julie and the family down here and I'll be back down to see em at Xmas time.
 I just got the word late friday. I have to give notice at work and that sucks! Bill Cook, the man I work for is a great guy and I really hate to leave him with really only 3 days of notice since next weekn will be a 3 day work week and I'm out with a minor back injury and won't be cleared till Tuesday. Bill is one of those guys ever one should work for. He'll give you the shirt off his back to help out and he's easy to talk to. But this is an oppertunity that I can't pass up, not just for the money or the chance to learn 2 new types of welding but a chance to be Home.
   Now that may seem a bit puzzling for most but it was meant to be. Somewhere down the road, I'll let you all in on it.

 My first hurricane. To be honest, it's not really worth writing about. Just a bad storm here. I know it would be a different matter if I was much farther south. But here in Maitland, just north of Orlando, it's lots of rain and strong winds. 
  Wind gusts here are about 20-30 mph. Been raining since about 11pm last night. May get worse here. Just don't know yet. They've  never seen a storm like this before. They've never had a tropical go to a Cat 5 in 24 hrs. Hell when this  one left Cozumel it was a Cat1. They said it'd hit Florida as Cat 1 maybe 2. Survey says ""Wrong!"" She made strength up to Cat 3 with winds of 125 mph.

 We will know more tomorrow as to where and more likely when she'll hit.

 I have never been through a hurricane before and am looking forward to it. 
 Been through way too many earthquakes. So many that those of us from California and pretty much tell the magnitude of the quake before the news tells us! LOL

 Also, One thing I can tell you is that with a hurricane like this, my new voicemail will sound something like this: ""Hi, You reached Jason/Wolf's cell. I clocked in at 6am monday morning. I don't know what day it is but leave a message and I'll call you when I clock out. Thanks.""

 Yeah it will be like that pretty much. I'll be putting in like a 100-125 hrs a week! No Kidding!! 4 hours of sleep a night in the truck and then on to work, tearing down old doors and putting up new ones.

This weekend, Heath and I are gonna be putting away all loose lawn furniture and getting ready just in case Wilma moves this way.

 I'm working for a company installing overhead doors. Much like you see in warehouse and such. Work all over Florida and work a hell of a lot of hours! I go in at 6am and usually don't get home till 8-10pm!

 Lost about 15 pounds and have gained back a bit of muscle. There's plenty of heavy lifting in my field of work and I won't even get started about the heat! Let's just say that about 10am my shirt's already soaked straight thru!

 Don't really wear my kilts anymore. Jeans and work shirts during the week and shorts and tank tops on the weekends.

 Now while I'm not EMS or anything like that(and no it's not a requirement for DC security) But it would be nice to have my certs, ya know?
 SO my question is this:
 Where do I go in the ATL area for first aid/cpr certification?"

1. If you are choking on an ice cube, don't panic. Simply pour a cup of boiling water down your throat and presto. The blockage will be almost instantly removed.

2. Clumsy? Avoid cutting yourself while slicing vegetables by getting someone else to hold them while you chop away.

3. Avoid arguments with the Mrs. about lifting the toilet seat by simply using the sink.

4. For high blood pressure sufferers: simply cut yourself and bleed for a few minutes, thus reducing the pressure in your veins. Remember to use a timer.

5. A mouse trap, placed on top of your alarm clock, will prevent you from rolling over and going back to sleep after you hit the snooze button.

6. If you have a bad cough, take a large dose of laxatives, then you will be afraid to cough.

7. Have a bad toothache? Smash your thumb with a hammer and you will forget about the toothache.

Sometimes, we just need to remember what the rules of life really are:
You only need two tools: WD-40 and Duct Tape.
If it doesn't move and should, use the WD-40.
If it shouldn't move and does, use the duct tape."

"event","Been a long weekend. Wasn't the greatest for me either.
 Thursday night I went to <lj user=""thegreyman"">'s and played X box games. PLayed Godzilla:Save the Earth. COOl game!! He brought home the projector and we played on the wall. No sissy tv screen for us!!

 We also played Crimson Skies. and we also played Star Wars Battlefront!! Yeah, I got to busta cap in an Ewok's ass!! Also got to busta cap in a Wookie's ass too!!

 Finally ended the night by playing Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Now that was a cool game too!!

 Friday Marva and I headed down to Clombus to see Justin of Ranger Knives. Yes Justin was a Ranger. Now he does security work over in Iraq. He was home for about a month. He didn't have the knife I was lkooking for cuz they were at the heat treater's. But He did have these really cool pieces called Ti-rings. They're a ppiece of titanium that's worn like a ring and has a small edge/blade so the ring can eitherr be worn blade out, like a push dagger or blade worn in, which can give a new meaning to bitch slap!
 Just is a great guy who makes simple, easy inexpensive knives for the regular working man. He's also very easy to talk to and deal with. For example, when we showed up, he only had a few minutes since he had to drop off 200 knives to be heat treated. Marva found a Ti-ring she liked but didn't quite fit her. Justin said ""No problem!"" Took it out to his shop and re sized it. That one didn't quite work out as he made it a little big. Grabbed another one and went back out and brought us with him and sized another one for her. Fit just right! Was there any xtra charge? Nope. not at all. As a matter of fact he even gave us a break on the price!
 Here's his website:http://www.rangerknives.com/

Now when we got to Albany and unloaded, I started to come down with something. And it wasn't nice!
 Missed the gig friday night, went out and had breakfast saturday and didn't feel any better. Basically I just stayed in bed in the hotel room all weekend. Feel better today. Still gonna take Nyquil in a couple of hours. Marva's gonna go do Karaoke tonight."

"event","Heat took a hell of a toll on me yesterday.
 When I lived in Mississippi, I worked out in the shipyards as a combo fitter.. Which means I can tack weld and use a torch. 
 Now the problem with this is it's not a cool job and in the summer time it really sucks! Why?
#1. Hell. It's not the heat. It's the humidity!! Ain't that the damn truth!! Humid weather like we had on the Gulf Coast suck ass!!

#2. I was basically creating large metal boxes. What I did was called sub- assembly. We built sections of the ships and sent em on for Final assembly. But overall, they were just big metal boxes.

#3 We didn't have air conditioning of any sort. We were lucky if we found a fan.

#4. And finally, most of the time I worked on these units outside. That's right! not only did I have to contend with heat from my torch and humidity, but I also had the sun pounding down from above.

 So what's this all got to do with me??  Heat Exhaustion. I've had it 3 times and on the 3rd time they wound up shipping me to the Hospital where I had 2500cc of fluid pumped into my system.

 So you can see, that this heat hits me faster and harder and you guys beacuse once you've had heat exhaustion, your body doesn't go back to the way it was and your body can't dissipate the heat absorbed as fast as other people.

 Ya see, I work in a building where there's no air conditioning, the roof is corragated steel above me with no insulation. So it's kinda like the shipyard all over again(except the pay here SUX!) Working in a metal box with the sun pounding down on that lovely steel roof!!

 I stopped sweating around 5pm yesterday. Not a good sign. First sign of Heat Exhaustion. Now I was drinking water and gatorade like they were going outta style. But I just couldn't keep it in, even though I went to the bathroom like 3 times. Luckily I was able to cool down and get more  fluids into me and started sweating again.

 Other problem that is associated is called muscle cramps. Now even though I didn't have em really, my body this moring felt like I had a hell of a work out and not in A good way.

Went into work for a bit and didn't feel so good so I came home and cooled down.

 Need a different job. this one sucks. Think I'll do that friday. Look into Monster and AJC and see what's in there."

 Firday night Freedom Reign played a place called Sportsline. You may have seen my friday post about that. And if you've read <lj user=""muffle1969"">'s saturday post then you know that went well.

 Yesterday <lj user=""muffle1969""> and I went up to Gainseville to the North Georgia Celtic Festival after we did some running around and went to her mom's. The festival was neat. Saw a lot of Utilikilts there. Marva bought a new tye-dye outfit and I bought canned haggis and canned whiskey cake!! WOO HOO!! I'll have to make it probably next weekend when she's out installing servers at work.
 She also bought me a shirt that says  ""GOT SCOTCH?"". And on the back is a map of the Whiskey Trail and all the distilleries along the trail.

 We came home and relaxed for a bit and then went to the movies..

Saw The Island.

 Damn was that a good one!! Bit long in lenght but really well done and kept me on the edge of my seat.
 The story line, the charcaters, the effects were terriffic!! Must see!!

 Just finished mowing the back lawn. Did the front on friday and decided what the hell, I'll mow in my kilt.Right? Wrong!!!
 Half way through got hit by 2 wasps in my ankles. One on the inside of my right ankle and one on the outside of my left ankle, just above my boots and right through the socks!! I'll tell you, it was just like a couple of snow speeders from Empire Strikes Back, taking on an AT-AT!!
 Bastards knew where to hit a large target!!!
 No strange reactions or side effects save lots of itching and massive red spots where they stung me.

 Have more cleaning and laundry to do today. But hopefully my kydex stuff will come in this week and I can start making Schtuff!!

 So what I'm wondering is since Marva may be out doing work stuff next saturday,<lj user=""thegreyman"">, and <lj user=""aggression""> wanna come over and make stuff and have canned haggis with me?"

 So if anyone's looking for a new sheath for a knife,let me know. This can also be used to make a holster for firearms. But you'd have to bring the gun to me, no ammo or magazine.

FRANKFURT, Germany - German and U.S. scientists have launched a project to reconstruct the Neanderthal genome, the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology said Wednesday.

The project, which involves isolating genetic fragments from fossils of the prehistoric beings who originally inhabited Europe, is being carried out at the Leipzig-based institute.

""The project is very new and is just at its beginning,"" said Sandra Jacob, a spokeswoman for the institute.

U.S. geneticist Edward Rubin, from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., is also participating in the project.

In an interview with the German weekly Die Zeit, Rubin said the research would amount to more than just a spectacular display of science.

""Firstly, we will learn a lot about the Neanderthals. Secondly, we will learn a lot about the uniqueness of human beings. And thirdly, it's simply cool,"" Rubin said.

Neanderthals were replaced by modern humans in Europe only between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago.



My whole question is.. Why?

 I mean it's still evident in certain parts of this country. Hell, Just head on down to some of the ship yards I worked at in Mississippi!!!!

 It's quite obvious that there are certain people among us who haven't quite reched the bottom rung of the evolutionary ladder.  LOL"

 So here was the deal: Pete had a Hardrock speacilized that I liked for $330+. I was gonna put money down on it and do a lay away. But Pete and I talked a bit and I just gave him my kilt credits from the Atlanta Pride Show. Plus, in exchange for my services today, he even threw in a brain bucket(helmet)
 SO I now  have a new mountain bike and helmet. I just need a few more things and I really ready to ride. I need lights(front and back), a good bike lock and water bottle cage, which I'll get next time.

 Now all I need to do is get Marva a good bike and start riding like Stone Mountain or Peidmont Park or some place like that. Perhaps maybe a trip down to Wal-mart or Target to look at their bikes to see what they have for her.

 SO let's Ride!!"

 Ya know, this is like the second time I've gotten Anakin. Does this mean I'll eventually turn to the Dark side?"

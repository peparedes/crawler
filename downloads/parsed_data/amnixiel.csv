"event","I've been struggling with my internal divisions very heftily lately.&nbsp; People who know me know that I've gone through some serious emotional trauma during the past year.&nbsp; Following the events of November, 2005, I suffered from a wide range of psychological problems: it would be fair to say that I've been scarred for life.&nbsp; Prior to that, I had been building up my self-confidence and beginning to believe that I could honestly make a difference in the world.&nbsp; Everything was shattered for me.&nbsp; For six months, I lived through an almost unbearable paradigm of powerlessness and nihilism.&nbsp; It was a constant struggle.

For the past few months, I've been getting back into a more comfortable mindscape.&nbsp; I'm still haunted, though.&nbsp; I'm the home of two conflicting paradigms.&nbsp; The first says that it is the responsibility of every person to make the most of their resources and to encourage others to do the same- that you can accomplish anything that you are willing to work for.&nbsp; It's just a matter of being bold and taking the initiative.&nbsp; 

The second paradigm says that the world is a malicious place, and that there is nothing a person can do to prevent the pain except pretend it doesn't hurt.&nbsp; To make something good is like squeezing blood out of a rock- possible, but only at the expense of putting so much of your energy into something that it ends up being self-destructive.&nbsp; Even if you do, forces beyond your control can ruin it like the ocean and so many sand castles.&nbsp; Initiative is wasted effort, and the bold are cut down.
I'm currently going between the two.&nbsp; I was describing them to my mom as almost being like multiple personalities.&nbsp; Neither is seperate from the entity that I would define as 'me', but when behavior adapts to paradigm.&nbsp; When I'm operating under a different paradigm, I have different behavior.&nbsp; BAM.&nbsp; It's like I'm two people.

I had a funny thought to refer to one as seme and the other as uke- I just got back from A-kon, and have been surrounding by yaoi terms.&nbsp; After doing some research, I discovered that the roots of the terms are as follows: semeru, which is to attack, and ukeru, which is to recieve.&nbsp; This seems like an apt way to describe my conflicting paradigms, so I think I'll use it.

Given the choice, I prefer Seme Ram.&nbsp; He's more productive, is more effecient with resources, and more self-confident.&nbsp; He feeds on my ambitions and goals.&nbsp; Uke Ram feeds on all of the bad things that are beyond my control.&nbsp; 

I think that Seme would be able to regain his dominance if his actions were rewarded.&nbsp; I'm looking for a few good things to happen, and trying to keep Seme in control long enough to put myself in the position to allow those good things to happen.&nbsp; I'm going to take a few more large chances and hope that November doesn't repeat itself at my expense."

"event","Earlier today I was asked a fairly poignant question by a former significant other.  It was particualrly poignant to the nature of my relationship with her; ""would you want someone to date you out of pity, or out of social obligation?"".  She assumed that my answer would be no...

This is an area where my views of relationships become a little unorthodox.  Given the liberty and freedom that we're raised with, I've been told that it's politically incorrect to refer to any action conducted out of social obligation as being positive.  Social obligation is an imposition on individualism and free will.

I'd like to take a moment to examine how I percieve the alternative.  When I look at modern monogamous culture, I can't help but see the strategies that permeate it.  By definition, to be in an exclusive relationship prohibits being in other relationships.  The structure of the relationship artificially inflates its value, meaning that a person will pass up 'lesser' opportunities to pursue a 'greater' opportunity (which might not be mutually exclusive except because of the artificial inflation).  It's a philosophy that rewards denying the honest expression of the feelings of others and the self.

To use an example: A really likes B, B is in love with C, and C absolutely adores A.  If B becomes romantic with A, that excludes the possibility of a relationship with C.  The choice for B is obvious, then.  Because of its exclusivity, B's romance is probably worth too much to settle for A (even if A and B are good friends and B kinda likes A).  It's a romantic gridlock, and the first person to do anything other than deny affection has effectively compromised the inflated value of their romance.

I was raised to give the emotions of others heavy consideration, to believe that love is a gift.  When someone shows me love, its only appropriate to embrace it and appreciate it in whatever ways seem healthiest.  In essence, I was raised to give love and accept it, not to pursue it.  The last time I was in a situation described above, the A to my B turned into someone that I was involved with for three years.

Under the model I was raised with, I might end up giving someone that I wouldn't have been excited about a chance, but the favor would be returned.  The relationships might not develop the way I would want them to, but they would be a more honest expression of my interactions with the people involved.  They would be what they are, not what I try to make them.

I suppose a more politically correct word for a sense of social obligation is a sense of respect.  Little anarchist that I am, though, I like to think that the former is the latter anyway.

Maybe it'd be a sacrifice of my individualism and free will to act out of a sense of social obligation, and to expect others to do the same, but is it really a sacrifice to act out of respect?  As dysfunctional as it appears prima facie, even a pity date is still an acknowledgement of one person's value of the other."

<div align=""center""><font size=""5"">What are Weekend Comics?<br /></font></div>
<br />There are two kinds of Weekend Comics: purist and open.  The important thing with both is that they are community efforts, and that the end result is something that all of the contributors can be proud of.<br /><br />To make a purist Weekend Comic, the organizer will schedule one weekend.  All of the work on the anthology will take place during that weekend, in much the same way that all of the work on a 24-hour Comic from beginning to end takes place within 24 hours.  Ideally, there will be a space where contributors will be able to work together.  By dividing the workload, it should be less strain on the individuals than during an entire 24-hour Comic.  At the end of the weekend, the organizer should compile all of the submissions into a publication ready for distribution.<br /><br />To make an open Weekend Comic, contributors are free to submit material over an extended period.  If the group is publishing their Weekend Comics monthly, contributors might be able to have an entire month to submit material.  This format is even less intense for the contributors, and is easier to maintain.<br /><br />The content can be as cohesive or divergent as the contributors want it to be.  There might be common themes, settings, characters, or it might be a free-for-all.  The important thing is that each creator or creator team is free to tell their own story.  <br />The ultimate goal of a Weekend Comic is to have a finished publication.  It might have a print run as low as 20 or as high as 500 or 1,000.  It might be given away for free or sold, but it should result in physical copies.  <br /><br />If possible, try to put out several consecutive monthly issues!<br /><br />Participants are encouraged to be as hands on as possible.  By the end of the challenge, the organizers should have gained experience with everything from creating editorial direction and producing the material to assembling the publication and distributing it.  It's the complete indie publishing experience.<br /><br /><font size=""5""><br /></font>
<div align=""center""><font size=""5"">Distributing Weekend Comics</font><br /></div>
<br />The easiest thing to do with a Weekend Comic is to have all of the contributor's chip in for how many copies they want.  Distribution and production costs are all easily handled.<br /><br />Taking the Weekend Comics to the next level, though, can be absolutely thrilling!  To do this, you have to ask yourself what groups you want to appeal to, and how to appeal to them.<br /><br />Our experiences so far are that distributing through comic book stores produces disappointing results.  Most Weekend Comics are produced on a tight budget, and lack the visual oomph (color, tabloid size, etc) to be noticed on a comic book shelf.  You're welcome to try to distribute through comic book stores, but it's a good idea not to rely exclusively on them.<br /><br />So then, where to distribute?  That depends on your area.  Coffee shops seem to work really well.  The best places to target are areas with large gatherings of people with a common interest and tailor your Weekend Comics to interest them.  Does your town have an indie music scene?  Is there an upcoming convention or rally?  What about distributing at church?<br /><br />When you have a large gathering, you can maximize your distribution for minimal.  We expect to have distribution of over 1,000 copies for two nights worth of distribution.  This is where having the material in print is useful.  Elctronic media may have replaced a large chunk of publishing, but print still rules at the local event.  <br /><br />Make sure to get permission before you distribute!  When you work with other people in your community, it's a win-win situation.<br /><br />To get maximum value, you can put your Weekend Comics on the web.  If you put the website address in your print copies, they'll act as advertising for your website.<br /><br /><br />
<div align=""center""><font size=""5"">Funding Weekend Comics</font><br /></div>
<br />Funding really depends on how you're distributing and in what quantities.  Pay-to-play arrangements, where each contributor pays for part of the printing, work well with small print runs or as a start-up.  If you don't have any money to begin with, you might have the contributors donate money for the first issue and use sales from that issue to fund the next issue or project.  <br /><br />Most local vendors will be happy to carry your comics on consigment, meaning that they keep a portion of all sales and you keep all unsold copies.  This is nice because they have no upfront financial risk, but it takes some extra organization (and math) to be able to collect your share of sales.  <br /><br />If you're distributing through an event, you might need to pay a fee for space.  The farther outside of the box you think for audiences, the easier it can be to avoid vendor fees (at least until you've lost your novelty).<br /><br />Distributing your Weekend Comics for free makes it a lot easer; you can usually leave them at key areas and let the distribution take care of itself.  Unless you have an abundance of money, though, you'll be stuck paying for printing either through grants or advertising.  Neither is for the faint of heart.<br /><br /><br />
<div align=""center""><font size=""5"">Where did the idea of Weekend Comics come from?</font><br /></div>
<br />In 2003, I established a student organization at my college for aspiring comic book artists and cartoonists.  We threw around a lot of ideas, and talked about publishing an anthology, but never fully accomplished very much other than having a good time.<br /><br />In 2004, Mason Monigold, who helped establish the organization, told me that two of the charter members, Andy Moore and Kevin Flynn, had been working over the summer to start publishing a comic anthology.  The first issue was coming out in three days.<br /><br />In the spirit of friendly competition, we decided that we'd publish our first issue on the same day that theirs was released.<br /><br />Both Mason and I were familiar with Scott McCloud's 24-hour Comic challenge, and had completed 24-hour Comics.  We figured that if we could each do a 24-hour Comic, working together to fill a 28 page zine in two days shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />It became a monthly endeavor.  As it developed, it became as much of a learning experience in publishing and distributing as it was in making comics.  By the end of our first six issues, 14 locals had contributed their talents and we had published 168 pages.</div>"

I'll use the rest of the evening to tailor my profile on several of the communities that I'm active in.  I need to create profiles for my livejournal, Yaoi Gallery, and MySpace accounts.  I also need to start getting my current works up for display."

"event","I like to think that I learn from my mistakes.  At this point in my life, I'm a firm believer that, while there is no inherent meaning in events, meaning can be extrapolated from them; that things do not happen to teach lessons, but lessons can still be construed from events.  This journal, and the website that I'm working on in tangent with it, are examples of this view.

My life officially went to hell last semester.  I'm basically trying to reforge my identity.  I intend to build myself better, stronger.  I have the technology.

The first few updates in this journal will be fairly experimental.  It's mostly to test out integrating this journal into my website, www.RamNexus.com.  Thank you for your patience."

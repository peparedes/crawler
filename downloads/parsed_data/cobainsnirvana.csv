"event","Sky is a retard. I am sitting right next to her right now and talking to her as I am writing this. TEEN GIRL SQUAD!!! SOOOOO GOOD!!!! Sky is not a butt hole though, she is just stupid. But, butt hole or not, she is still my cool buddy. Anyways, I might not be on here again for a few days, maybe even weks because I am grounded off of the internet at my house and I am at school. Oh well, my parents dont know about this, so shhhhh, dont tell them!!!"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""doodeedoo""><p>transferencexx: Erik considered himself a genius. Moreso than usual. If that was possible. As he walked away from the compuslve over-eater's room he contemplated what exactly would happen if anyone found out where he was pawning off his food. He was small. Maybe he'd say something about being threatened.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye was sitting out in the hallway with Salem in his lap. Salem looked pretty fucking terrified at the whole situation.<br />transferencexx: Salem always looked terrified to Erik. But that may have just been a reflection upon how Erik felt himself. Perhaps it was some crazy psychological thing. Or perhaps he was just psyched as fuck he'd found a new way to avoid food.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye was stroking Salems hair, Salem was almost shivering. Skye looked up as Erik approached. He smiled ""Hello little Erik""<br />transferencexx: Erik stopped in his tracks. He turned his head to glare at Skye, ""Did you just call me little ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""That I did"" He said letting go of Salem, who promptly rose to his feet and practically ran away<br />transferencexx: ""How about you don't.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Aww what are you going to do about it little Erik?"" He said standing up<br />transferencexx: Erik rolled his eyes and began to walk away. He didn't need to deal with Skye two days in a row.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Dont walk away when Im speaking to you"" he pushed Erik to the floor.<br />transferencexx: Erik yelped as he hit the ground. He was not fond of hitting the ground. ""I'll do what I want.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""No, you'll do what i tell you to do"" Pushing down Erik with his foot as he tried to get up.<br />transferencexx: Erik pulled Skye's foot and sent him crashing to the floor. ""So one would think.""<br />TelecastRiot: Skye hiot the ground hard, but managed to quickly grab hold on Eriks hair and bashed his pretty little face into the floor. =]<br />transferencexx: Erik propped himself up on an elbow and spat out blood. ""The fuck do you want from me ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I want you to understand your place"" he said bitterly.<br />transferencexx: ""The hell does that mean ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Dont try to stand up to me, life doesnt work that way around her""<br />transferencexx: ""Well, maybe it should. Maybe I'll make it.""<br />TelecastRiot signed off at 1:37:50 PM. <br />TelecastRiot: ""you wont make shit"" he growled and pushed Erik away from him<br />transferencexx: ""If you're trying to teach me my place pushing me away won't do any good."" Erik laughed at him.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye pounced on him and helf his throat to the wall. ""I wont hesitate to fucking kill you, you little shit"" he growled<br />transferencexx: ""Then do it."" Erik dared him, ""If I'm such a bad person what would it matter ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I never said you were bad"" he frowned<br />transferencexx: ""You've been insinuating it for the past two days.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""And you think Im not a bad person?"" he smiled<br />transferencexx: ""I know you are."" Erik said pushing Skye away, ""You just happen to be stronger than i am.""<br />TelecastRiot: Skye laughed ""No one will rise above me"" he said standing up ""I own this place""<br />transferencexx: ""That doesn't make me afraid of you."" Erik said, his mouth still bleeding a little.<br />TelecastRiot: ""You know youre terrified""<br />transferencexx: ""Prove it.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""You already told me you are""<br />transferencexx: ""Yeah, fuck you.""<br />TelecastRiot: Skye leaned down and kissed Erik gently on the forehead ""Dont be so harsh now Erik""<br />transferencexx: Erik shoved Skye away. ""Don't.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""you cant deny me anything Erik"" he smiled<br />transferencexx: ""I can deny you whatever I want.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Come with me"" he said, holding his hand out to Erik<br />transferencexx: Erik stared at the hand. Did Skye really thing he would go with it ? ""Yeah, no.""<br />TelecastRiot: Skye grabbed Eriks hand anyway ""You do what I say"" he said pulling him to his feet<br />transferencexx: Erik pulled his hand back, ""You will stop touching me."" he countered.<br />TelecastRiot: ""I wouldnt have to touch you if you would just listen""<br />transferencexx: ""I have no reason to listen to you.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Everyone has a reason tolisten to me""<br />transferencexx: ""I don't.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Of course you do. I wouldnt want to have to kill you if you dont"":<br />transferencexx: ""I'd really like to see that.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I wouldnt want to upset bert"" he laughed<br />transferencexx: Erik smirked, ""Exactly.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I upset bert a lot"" he smirked<br />transferencexx: ""I'm sure you enjoy it.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Of course I do"" he smirked ""He cant handle me either""<br />transferencexx: ""What is wrong with you ?""<br />TelecastRiot: He shrugged ""You tell me""<br />transferencexx: Erik began to walk away again, ""I don't even want to know.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Come back, please"" this being the first time he had ever said please to anyone, it surprised even him<br />transferencexx: Erik paused and looked back, ""What ?"" he asked, harshly.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Please."" he asked ""Come back""<br />transferencexx: ""Why ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""because Im asking you to""<br />transferencexx: Erik sighed and walked back to him, ""What are you going to do to me this time ?""<br />TelecastRiot: And curiously, Skye just hugged him<br />transferencexx: Erik was quite perplexed. Unsure of what else to do he slowly brought his arms around Skye and returned the hug. He hoped to pull away as soon as possible and check for missing limbs.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye pulled away from him and turned away and started to walk off down the hall<br />transferencexx: ""What the fuck was that ?!"" Erik cried after him.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye turned back and smiled ""Why so curious?""<br />transferencexx: ""Because you're fucking psycho and I want to know why !"" Erik fumed, ""Yesterday you were a second from killing me and today you give me a hug ? What does that even mean ?!""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I wouldnt be here if I could control it Erik"" he smiled faintly.<br />transferencexx: ""What is wrong with you ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""A lot fo things Erik"" he smirked ""Want to find out?""[<br />transferencexx: He did. ""I think I'd rather not.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""yes you do""<br />transferencexx: Erik walked up to him and pushed him back a little. ""Then show me.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""You really want that?"" he smiled<br />transferencexx: ""Maybe I do.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Why do you deserve to be shown?""<br />transferencexx: ""Because you offered.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""But do you deserve it?"" he asked<br />transferencexx: ""I couldn't tell you.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Why is that?""<br />transferencexx: ""It's based on your opinion. I couldn't tell you your opinion.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""My opinion is that youre weak"" he smirked<br />transferencexx: ""So do you think I deserve it then ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I think you deserve more than me""<br />transferencexx: ""What ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Im a bad person Erik"" Memphis just happened to walk into the hallway. He stopped dead in his tracks and stared at the other two<br />transferencexx: Erik held up a finger to Skye to tell him to wait. ""You fucking owe me money."" Erik hissed.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye blinked a few times and looked at his brother. Memphis back up a few steps&nbsp; and just kind of stared, not really sure of his brothers mood<br />transferencexx: Erik let his hand fall to his side and continued glaring at Memphis.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye nodded and Memphis smirked. He flicked 50 cents to the floor and laughed ""Ive had better"". Skye burst out laughing, for once, not able to hold his composure.<br />transferencexx: He didn't find the humour in this. If had any reason to believe neither of them would kill him he probably would have done or said something about it. He just pushed past Skye and walked away. Standing up for himself wasn't worth it anymore. It never had been,<br />TelecastRiot: ""Oh Erik"" Memphis laughed ""Dont be such a bitcccch""<br />transferencexx: Erik ignored him and turned a corner. He didn't even know where the corner led to, he just didn't want to be near them.<br />TelecastRiot: Around the corner Chance was sitting on the floor he looked up at Erik ""Go back, you might learn something"" he smirked<br />transferencexx: ""Go fuck yourself,"" Erik took the oppertunity to kick him in the face as he walked by. He'd always wanted to do that to some one.<br />TelecastRiot: When Erik kicked him, the wound on his face opened and covered him in blood. Chance basiaclly lost it all together, its about time for his mental breakdown. He stood up and knocked Erik down, he proceeded to punch the other boy in the face multiple times while blood dripped down his face and neck. Shit son, he messed with the wrong kid at the wrong moment =]<br />transferencexx: Erik deserved it. He knew he deserved it. He'd had it a long time coming. In fact, it wasn't even the first time he found himself coughing blood onto the floor that day. Which just goes to show how popular he was. He pushed the fringe out of his eyes and wiped his then bloody hand on his jeans before groaning, ""Yeah. I love you, too.""<br />TelecastRiot: Chance looked at him ""Youre right, you did deserve it"" he said getting up and wiping blood off his face<br />transferencexx: He laughed, ""It was worth it.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Was it Erik?"" Chance said wiping more blood off of him<br />transferencexx: Erik nodded, ""Fucking yes.""<br />TelecastRiot: Skye and Memphis went around the corner and stopped in their tracks. ""What the fuck happened to you two?"" Skye asked with a laugh<br />transferencexx: Erik sat up. ""Elephants."" he said completely deadpan.<br />TelecastRiot: Chance just walked off, holding his face in fury and embarssment. Memphis giggled at him.<br />transferencexx: ""I kicked him in the face."" Erik shrugged. ""What is he embarrassed to get kicked in the face by some one half his size ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Looks like he did a number on you too"" Skye said glancing at Erik<br />transferencexx: ""I've seen worse."" he dismissed the situation.<br />TelecastRiot: Skye smirked ""He can hurt you worse that I can...to bad he doesnt have any pride""<br />transferencexx: ""I'm not too scared of him, to be honest.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""You wont be saying that when he rips your tongue out of your head from 5 feet away from you"" Skye laughed and Memphis nodded<br />transferencexx: ""I'll care when it happens."" He said as he got up. ""Tell me the truth, how busted is my face right now ? Not counting how busted it always is.""<br />TelecastRiot: Memphis smirked ""He fucked you up good enough""&nbsp; he looked at his brother ""Im sure we could do worse"" Skye just shook his head and Memphis frowned<br />transferencexx: ""Blah."" He tried in vain again to wipe more of the blood off his face. ""Do you guys know where Bert is ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""He hasnt been around all week"" memphis said simply<br />transferencexx: ""I've noticed. Do you know where he is ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""No one does"" Skye said.<br />transferencexx: Erik frowned, ""But I want him.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""maybe you should deal with chance first"" he smirked<br />transferencexx: ""What do you mean ?"":<br />TelecastRiot: ""It was pretty uncalled for"" he shrugged<br />transferencexx: ""What ? Me kicking him ? I've wanted to do that since the day I met the motherfucker.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""But he has been pretty nice to yourecently, hasnt he?"" Memphis asked<br />transferencexx: ""That's only becau--"" Erik's eyes widened with realization of what he was about to say, ""Yeah. Well. Shit happens.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Then why hurt him if hes good to you?"" skye asked<br />transferencexx: ""I hold grudges."" <br />TelecastRiot: ""point being?""<br />transferencexx: ""Point being you of all people aren't going to tell me when I should and should not be violent.""<br />TelecastRiot: Skye shrugged ""So be it""<br />transferencexx: ""Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to go wash my face and lay in my boyfriend's bed until he comes back."" After taking a quick moment to figure out which direction he had to travel in to get where he wanted to be, Erik skirted past the brothers and down the hall.<br />TelecastRiot: Chance just so happened to be in Bert room, looking for a shirt. All of his were dirty, so he figured hed find one there from his bestest best budddddy<br />transferencexx: Erik was beginning to wonder if he was just born unlucky or if it was an inherited skill. Doing his best to avoid even looking at Chance he picked up once of his own t-shirts from the floor. That's where the majority of his clothing ended up at one point or another because when he was with Bert that's just where he threw them. ;D<br />TelecastRiot: Chance pulled on one of Berts bright yellow shirts, Berts trademark dammit. Even chance hair had blood in it, it had gotten longer and he figured he should cut it soon. He was almost starting to look slightly like his best friend.<br />transferencexx: That happened to be Erik's favourite shirt. Nobody wore it but Bert. Erik had distinctly made it a rule in his own head that not even he himself could wear that shirt. ""Take it off.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""No"" Chance said simple ""It use to be mine, I can wear it if I want""<br />TelecastRiot: *simply<br />transferencexx: ""Chance, I said take it off. I don't care if it was yours. Take it off.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""ITS MY SHIRT ANYWAY"" he yelled at him.<br />transferencexx: ""I don't care."" Erik said again calmly. ""Take it off.""<br />TelecastRiot: Chance finally did and pulled on one of memphis' shirts ""happy?"" he asked. His long black hair falling into his eyes and she shook furiously with anger<br />transferencexx: He smiled victoriously. ""Thank you. Do you know where Bert is ?"" he used the shirt that he had picked up to wipe off whatever blood hadn't dried on. He tended to get spontaneous hour long nosebleeds as it is, getting a beatdown didn't help.<br />TelecastRiot: ""I dont care where bert is"" He said laying down in Berts bed<br />transferencexx: ""Why ? Because I want to know ?"" Erik sat down next to where Chance was laying and pet the boy's hair affectionately. Because apparently Erik is bipolar and does things like that.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Leave me alone. I dont know where he is"" he said softly.<br />transferencexx: ""Is something wrong ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""You kicked me in the face""<br />transferencexx: ""Out of love !""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I saw it comming and I didnt even try to stop you..."" he trailed off<br />transferencexx: ""Why not ? You should've."" Erik said, returning to his petting. Chance had soft hair. He couldn't help himself.<br />TelecastRiot: ""I didnt want to"" he whispered<br />transferencexx: ""Why didn't you want to ?"" Erik always felt bad that he asked so many questions, but Chance always had this unfair advantage of knowing everything.<br />TelecastRiot: ""I feel bad for hitting you"" he said avoiding the question slightly<br />transferencexx: ""Why didn't you stop me ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Because I care about you.""<br />transferencexx: ""So you let me kick you in the face ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Basiaclly"" he shook his head a litte<br />TelecastRiot: *little<br />transferencexx: Erik frowned. ""I'd kiss you but right now I'm a mess.""<br />TelecastRiot: Chance smiled to himself, but didnt turn around. He just picked at his hair a little bit. <br />transferencexx: Erik pulled a mirror out of the back of his boot. Whether he had a mirror in his boot because he was vain or because he was an addict was up for debate, but whatever the case it was there. He peered at himself in the mirror for a second, gauging just how bad he looked and whether or not he was still gushing liquids out of wounds. Deciding he was more or less okay, he pressed his lips to the back of Chance's neck. If he did manage to get blood on his, at least it wouldn't be his face, right ? It worked in his head.<br />TelecastRiot: Chance sighed lightly wehn eriks lips touched him<br />transferencexx: Erik smiled against Chance's skin. He ran his fingers down Chance's spine through the shirt he wore.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Why are you doing that?"" he whispered to Erik<br />transferencexx: ""Do you not like it ?"" Erik asked.<br />TelecastRiot: He just lay there for a moment before answering "" I do like it...""<br />transferencexx: ""That's why I'm doing it.""<br />TelecastRiot: Chance turned and looked at Erik, his eyes looked big, blue and sad. ""I dont understand you""<br />transferencexx: Erik smiled at him. ""What don't you understand ?""<br />TelecastRiot: (btw im finding a new chance, my other one diappeared)<br />transferencexx: [thank fucking god. no more blonde asian girls plz.]<br />TelecastRiot: ""Why you feel the need to be near me"" he said<br />TelecastRiot: dont worry about it)<br />transferencexx: ""I like you."" Erik said simply, ""Why wouldn't I want to be near you ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Because no one does"" he said simply<br />transferencexx: ""That's a lie and you know it.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""No, its the truth, and I know it""<br />transferencexx: ""I want to be near you. I love being near you.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""why though?"" he asked<br />transferencexx: ""Because.."" Erik sneaked his fingers under Chance's shirt, ""Right now you're my best friend.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Why?"" he asked again<br />transferencexx: ""I only really talk to you and Bert."" he admitted, ""Other than that there's Charlie in California but he's too busy denying that he's gay and there's Memphis and Skye but I fucking hate them so they don't count.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""They hate you too"" he commented<br />transferencexx: ""Good. We're like one big happy family then.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Dont worry, they hate me too""<br />transferencexx: ""Why do they hate you ? Do they just hate everyone ? Should I get the teletubbies ? We can reprogram them. Maybe they just weren't pet enough as children or something..""<br />TelecastRiot: ""They dont have friends"" he said slowly<br />transferencexx: ""Maybe if they didn't hate everyone they would.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""They dont need them""<br />transferencexx: ""Everyone needs friends.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""they have each other""<br />transferencexx: ""And half the time they seem to hate each other.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""they do""<br />transferencexx: Erik frowned. ""The point still stands. I want to be around you.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I dont see why""<br />transferencexx: ""I don't see why not.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""because Im ugly and stupid?""<br />transferencexx: ""You're gorgeous. What are you talking about ?"" Erik asked, ""I haven't considered you stupid once since the day I met you.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I feel stupid""<br />transferencexx: ""Why ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Because I suck at life"" he said simply touching the wound across his eye<br />transferencexx: Erik gently pushed Chance's hand away and kissed the wound. ""You don't suck at life.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Then why am I constantly being attacked by everyone verbally and physically?""<br />transferencexx: ""It happens to everyone."" he brushed the fringe out of Chance's eyes, ""I love you, alright ? Don't worry about it, you'll be fine.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""no you dont...""<br />transferencexx: ""Don't argue with me. Why do you let your self-esteem get so low when you're such an incredible person ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Because everyone hates me, even you do""<br />transferencexx: ""I don't hate you.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Yes you do""<br />transferencexx: ""No, I don't. I think I know who I hate.""<br />TelecastRiot: He sughed heavily ""I just feel alone<br />TelecastRiot: ""<br />TelecastRiot: *sighed<br />transferencexx: Erik pulled him up and kissed him. Softly. Slowly. ""You're not alone.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""From someone I know gives themselves to anyone who asks"" he frowned<br />transferencexx: ""Whatever."" Erik stood up from the bed, obviously hurt. ""Think what you want.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I think you dont care about me""<br />transferencexx: ""I do."" he folded his arms across his chest. ""And no one ever believes me.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Because you say it to everyone""<br />transferencexx: ""I don't say it to everyone. I love all of my friends in some way. I figured you of all people would be able to figure out there's a big difference between the way I love Charlie and [ican'tthinkofanyonehe'stalkedtolatelylalalalalala] and the way I love you and Bert. But, you know. Whatever. Don't believe me.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""You dont love me like you love bert:<br />transferencexx: ""It's pretty fucking close, Chance. I could never love anyone like I love him but you come pretty fucking close.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Why me?""<br />transferencexx: ""Because I thought you cared ! No matter how much I hated you, and no matter how much I hoped you'd get run over my fucking mack truck you were still there and you still acted like you gave a shit about me, alright ? I just thought you cared about me. And then in the tree house.. And now the more I think about it you were probably only doing it for Bert. Right ? Because you're his friend so you took pity on his boyfriend. I'm right, aren't I ?"" he leaned back against a wall with his head in his hands, ""God, I am such a shitty person.""<br />[YAY DIALOGUE.]<br />TelecastRiot: ""I do care about you, probably more than anyone"" he sighed ""That day in the treehouse was for him. It wasnt for anyone but us. I wanted you so much it hurt, I still do, every time I see you. I just want to hold you..."" he trailed off for a moment ""Its not about sex, its not about anything like that...Its because I love you, and always did""<br />TelecastRiot: yay for more dialogue!!<br />transferencexx: [I love dialogue.]<br />""Then why won't you believe me ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Im afraid"" he shrugged ""I know your history, probably better than anyone""<br />transferencexx: Erik laughed bitterly, ""I am trying so hard to forget that.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Why would you hurt Bert?"" he asked<br />transferencexx: ""I don't want to. I really, really don't want to.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Then why do you do it?""<br />transferencexx: ""I don't know. I don't think of it at the time.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Well maybe you should, because hes not the only one youre hurting""<br />transferencexx: ""Oh ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Youre hurting me too, Erik""<br />transferencexx: ""Don't let me hurt you.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""That means not seeing you""<br />transferencexx: ""Then maybe you shouldn't see me.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I couldnt stop""<br />transferencexx: ""You need to. I don't want to hurt anyone more than I already have.""<br />TelecastRiot: He frowned <br />transferencexx: ""I can't keep hurting people.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I know Erik"" he kissed Eriks lips lightly and started to get up<br />transferencexx: Erik watched him, ""Where are you going ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""you wanted me away from you, so im going""<br />transferencexx: ""..I didn't mean it.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""What do you mean then?""<br />transferencexx: Erik sighed, ""I have no idea.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Try and tell me?""<br />transferencexx: ""I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't know what I can do to stop."" he explained, looking in the other direction as he spoke.<br />TelecastRiot: ""As you said, dont see me""<br />transferencexx: ""Don't even say that won't hurt you more. I know it will.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Everything hurts""<br />transferencexx: ""Is there anything I can do ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""Come here"" he said sitting on the bed next to him and patting his lap, beckoning to Erik<br />TelecastRiot: Chance kissed him light against the lips and then rest his head on Eriks shoulder ""I love you Erik""<br />transferencexx: ""I love you, too, Chance."" Erik said, stroking the boy's hair just as affectionately as he had been several hours earlier. ""I mean it.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""do you really?"" Chance asked softly<br />transferencexx: ""Would I say it if I didn't mean it ?"" Erik asked.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Dont make me leave you"" he said burying his face into Eriks neck<br />transferencexx: ""You wouldn't. I promise you I mean it."" he stole a glance towords the doorway, paranoid for whatever reason Bert would walk in at the worst moment.<br />TelecastRiot: Chance kissed Eriks neck softly ""I hate this...really""<br />transferencexx: ""Hate what ?"" Erik asked, his eyes fluttering closed.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Not being able to be around you all the time...""<br />transferencexx: ""You can be, it's just..""<br />transferencexx: ""We have to be sneaky.""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I cant have it that way"" he shook his head<br />transferencexx: Erik pecked Chance's nose, ""What do you want to do ? We can't change it.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Then I cant do anything"" he said shaking his head<br />transferencexx: ""What ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I dont want to hurt my best friend""<br />transferencexx: ""Then why are we doing this ?""<br />TelecastRiot: He sighed ""Cause I cant resist you""<br />transferencexx: Nobody ever could. ""So what do you suggest we do then ? Just hope he doesn't notice ?""<br />TelecastRiot: ""I dont know Erik"" he said sighing and standing up, still holding Erik. ""I love you...lots"" he said kissing erik on the forehead and laying him down on Bert bed. ""But I cant think right now""<br />transferencexx: Erik propped himself up on his elbows. ""So..are you going to.. go somewhere ?"" he asked.<br />TelecastRiot: ""Yes, I am""<br />transferencexx: ""Where ?"" he asked, pouting slightly.</p></div>"

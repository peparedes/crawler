and my mom just plain gets mad at whenever I do anything. right or wrong.
and its not like a yelling-right-away angry she just sighs and walks off and you feel like you've hurt her intentionally. because..you try to apologize and its like ""why did i come out here in the first place?"" kinda feeling...

"event","nothing interesting, so this'll be what I did today:

I got up when I was supposed to today [for once :)] its mostly because I heard my mom caughing terribly. =/ so of course I made a smart-ass comment and got a dirty look. like you know, always. ><

school.

1st pd- worked on a dumb essay w/ the sub about job applications.
2nd pd- watched a Brad Pitt movie [it was coolies]
3rd pd- study hall. Sara was done w/ com. service in the library so she'll be there for the rest of the year =]
4th pd- went over packet and looked at Octopai [octopusses]
lunch. Misty wasn't there ='(. TACOS =]
5th pd- did a worksheet. watched Mr. Phillips count
6th pd- study hall. Emily sitting with us again
7th pd- tv tech. zoned out while Steve & Ian worked on Silent film.
8th pd- German, made fun of Lamer freshmen while listening to FF tell us a story about the Pied Piper. also:: battle of the languages tomorrow. 

Battle of the languages:: kids from all language classes [german, french, spanish, latin] competing in random tasks/games to determine what the best language is. [-cough cough- german -cough cough-]


um...so then I went home and mom was on the phone w/ nextel so I shut up and then we figured out how my backwards headphones fit into my phone. It goes through the bluetooth. weird, right?

then mom left for work and my dad comes in and hands me a $20 bill and I'm like ""...thanks?""
dad: thats for being a good girl and driving so well all the time""
so I kinda accepted it. =] gonna buy much needed clothes.

lolz- Denise and I are talkin bad about Molly [my sis in law]
...its kinda funn

OH! by the way.
my parents are kinda...GOING TO FLORIDA tomorrow.
...without me.
they're making me stay with MOLLY.
I.HATE.HER SO BAD

also:: I have the hiccups. not fun.

um, OK so I've kinda had a lot of things to think about latley because my dad's ""ex"" girlfriend has been hanging out with me and my mom latley. AND SHES SO AWESOME.
 her name is Kristen.
and one time I told my mom that I think she would be such a cool step-mom and mom ruined it by saying this ""too bad, 'cause your stuck with me, honey""
...thanks ma...

so anyway she keeps coming over and thats cool.
my dad is an asshole, though.
he went to my cousin's ""lacrosse"" game at 6 and I went to bed at 12 and didn't see him.
><

still totally pissed at the Shakespeare thing, but I think we might just put it on as a school production.
ummm....yeah so you have to come see meeeee

One time my friend Sara told me that I could ""probably write a book from all my journal enteries.""
I think I might do that.
not immediatley
but one day.

okay, so yesterday at school, Mr. O'clock (the sub) let us on the computer in TV tech and I was looking up acting internships in philly and I find this website FOR THE SHAKESPEARE FEST! ugh

also, I was watching Queer as Folk for like 3 hours last night (<3) and Melanie and Lindsay ( the 2 lesbians) wanted to admit their kid into this special school and he couldn't get in b/c he had same sex parents!!
='(

OH! OH! and there was this commercial for philly and theres this 17th century guy and hes writing a letter to his lover and is all like ""I love you and miss you"" and all that junk so he says he'll meet his lover somewhere and hes standing there and here comes some lady walking by, but the way your viewing it, it makes it look like shes the lover. so she walks by. and here comes this dude and he meets our guy and they TOTALLY START MACKING
it was funny.
good commercial."

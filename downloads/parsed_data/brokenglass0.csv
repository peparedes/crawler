"event","i had to get my thoughts out. I dont like writing. I'm part of that new age that can only type, its sad. <br /><br />AT the moment:<br /><br />i've been working in the same place and doing the same thing for maybe 3-4 years now. my pay slightly increases with the years but has no real correlation to the time, effort, and responsibility i put in. I've recently been transfered to another location for reasons that arnt quite clear. I personaly feel i'm just THAT guy who could be moved without a fight. Ive been taken out of a place i felt comfortable, relaxed, welcomed, and valued and put into something that has the same job title but i'm talked to like if i was an idiot. I know my job VERY well and its an insult for these ppl to attempt to talk to me like i'm a new hire. <br /><br />I would start to plan to quite but i really dont know where to go. i feel that losing seniority in a job i put so much time into is just a waste. I worked&nbsp;SO&nbsp;INCREDIBLY&nbsp;HARD to get where i am... rather WAS. I dont know what to do or where to go..<br /><br /><br />After 2+ years with heather im finally alone. All those times we argued and all the times we didnt still linger. Saddly its those times i loved her more than anything that keep pulling on my heart strings. Its been about a month now and she had already found herself a new boy friend. One lesser in my opinion but really i saw this coming. She cant be alone. Me on the other hand, i'm here dealing feelings i loath. jealousy betrayal heartache.&nbsp; the worst of it all is that i can always step outside myself and see this little ball of hate i have become and ask Why?&nbsp; why the hell am i so angry? she cheated on me 5 times in 2 years, most recently was about 4 months ago and i called it. Im a fool. i wish i could hate her. i cant believe i miss her so much sometimes.&nbsp; This, like most things, just takes time right? hopefully i can find some piece of mind in the near future, but for now i'm just that little ball. <br /><br /><br />Home has been irritating even though i'm not here as much. when i am, i am in my room vegetating. Escaping from my other responsibilities and feelings that plague me during the day. Lately i have no drive to go out anywhere or i always second guess myself, should i stay or should i go? My room is slowly moving to a constant chaos. It hasnt been clean for sometime. I&nbsp;dont put my bed back into a couch because i simply dont care. the furniture is a wreck. i have little thins that have no value to me strung about, stored randomly out of sight out of mind. somehow i'm waiting for that 1 piece to tie it all together and set it so i can use all the gifts i've gotten in the past years. For now, it just appears i am a slob and ungrateful. <br /><br />Friends are still consistant. They are great ppl though the distance between me and THEM is increasing. The group that was in highschool together has no real place for me. they come they go, i can say hi or not and life could go on. I&nbsp;know they care, i know they would still back me with most things but the connection just seems weak and waning. Recently i found what heather to say about them somewhat true. Ridicule and chastisement can only go so far before someone takes it to heart. I know its a joke but really when is it enough? is there truth to it? why is it that i can still be constantly singled out amongst even the smallest of groups? Perhaps i'm too sensitive but who's to say. Its how they've been and how they will be. <br /><br />School seems never ending. Everytime i commit to making myself proud of what i am doing something happens to my psyche and i lose motivation or simply get distracted. its not homework, its not difficult. i am simply lost and undecisive. I&nbsp;look around me, at others my age or ppl i might have grown up with and i can compare accomplishments. I&nbsp;have none to speak of that hold substantial merrit. I have no plaques i have to certificates, no degrees, no full time well paying job, no travel experience, no depth to my porfolio. <br /><br />I simply dont know where i am going and even if i did have a destination, i wouldnt know how to get there or maintain it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>I AM LOST.<br /><br /><br /></strong>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This summer is one of the worst. I've had 2 eye infections, 1 throat infection, and several&nbsp; stops at the doctor and emergency room. I feel unappretiated at work, for the knowledge i have and how long i have been there, yet i am repremanded for not soliciting and having poor attendence due to said ilnesses. One of the few things I have enjoyed at kohls was the friends i had made, but since I am missing days, my friendly work relationships have dwindled. I am lost as far as college goes. I have no goals or ambitions other than the fear of letting down family, friends, and ultimatly myself. My attempts to solve some of these problems have been nothing short of pure apathy. I really have no one to blame but my own lathargic ass. But hopefully some self reflecting on this good ol' LJ will do some enlightening. <br /><br />Up sides? *shrug* There are alot. Lollapalooza was amazing. Spending time at poker tables and bowling allies. Dynamite guns? I still have yet to fully participate. But i'm excited. There's more, much more, its just hard to put it all down when you're tired. <br /><br />""won't you help a brother out""<br /><br />

caraba had brought, Leafing through the pagesm he found a story about
Narcissus. The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who
knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so
fascinated by himself that, one morning, her fell into the lake and
drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flowwer was born, which was
called the narcissus.<img style=""width: 181px; height: 134px;"" src=""http://www.aphotoflora.com/Narcissus%20papyraceus.jpg""><br>
<br>
But this was not how the author of the book ended the story...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of
the forest appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water,
transformed into a lake of salty tears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""why do you weep?"" asked the goddesses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I weep for Narcissus,"" the lake replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Ah, it is no suprise that you weep for Narcissus,""
they said, "" for though we always pursued him in the forest, you alone
could contemplate his beauty close at hand.""<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""But... was Narcissus beautiful?"" the lake asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Who better than you to know that?"" the goddesses
said in wonder. ""After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day
to contemplate himself!""<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lake was silent for some time. Finally it said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I weep for Narcissus, but i never noticed that
narcissus was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my
banks, i could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.""<br>

&nbsp;Nekura Sky: maybe<br>
<br>
Some how i think that i'm loosing some sense of reality, or what i
thought was reality.
Plato defines reality as IDEAS, the idea of a perfect circle that is
360 degrees all around. When you think about it, you never see a
perfect circle. It simply doesn't exist because of life's
imperfections.
So could be said about the idea of love. We all have our out personal
deffinitions, but do we ever see it? how close have we ever come to
realizing the idea of our ideal love? To simply obtain all 360 degrees
of love is impossible.<br>
So i can easily say i'm over the girl, the girl (physically, mentally,
spititually) constantly changes. My idea of love though, doesn't. I
think that what we HAD was something i could easily say was my closest
to an ideal love. My 359 degree circle.
<br>
In the year or so that its been done and gone, i have to say i still
think about it. Each time, i come to same conclusion. i'm not obsessive
about it, but its there. and i think it always will be some how. I
enjoy it, but i think i can just go ahead and look forward to what the
future brings, hopefully there is something just as good coming up. if
not, i can wait.

Patience is a virtue.<br>

I think its my mind telling me that The Devil you know is better than the Devil you don't, and that work isn't supposed to be fun otherwise it wouldn't be work.

My schedual... is swamped. I haven't planned anything for awhile and it scares me that i rarely have time to sit down anymore. I want to say that i need a vacation but then again... i havn't really earned it yet. School is a breeze and its passing by like one too.

Its shocking to say, but i'm 19 in 2 weeks. I didn't even relize how close october is but then again, it should have been a sign when Kohls put up Chirstmas trees in late september... ><

Went to the Sox game sunday and they won 3 to 1 with an out standing catch by Aaron Rowand. &lt;3</P>
<P>i think i'm getting sick but i'm still trying to go on living a normal life. Besides, like Cbass always says, ""it could be worse, i could be dead."" very true!</P>
<P>havn't talked to some people in awhile but i'm sure i'll get around to them by wednesday bowling. hopefully.</P>
<P>I need&nbsp;a bike helmet otherwise i'm going to die... or so i'm told. Maybe today. And those new bike laws... absolutley the dumbest thing ive ever heard, so many people are going to die... it horrible. i'm still going to ride on the side walk, like&nbsp;a rebel. like Billy Idol, like James Dean.</P>

<br>
I don't believe in original sin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only the traps we create<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ourselves and eachother<br>
Dreams turn into walking Nightmares.<br>
We are damned in the face of progress.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a world gone digital.<br>
We are religitally blessed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cursed, by flips of switches.<br>
Memory is strained, and drained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a sieve of behavior modems.<br>
We live in a place of wires,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and circuits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and electric desires,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corporatorial new models of progress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and equality for the fittest<br>
Freedom, the buzz-word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is heard but not seen<br>
An absurd new world is birthed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and distractions creatively relayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to hysterically voracious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consumers of goods.<br>
A tap, a touch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and we can download nirvana.<br>

<p>i saw the devil just the other day<br>dragging himself the subway<br>wrapped in an old fur coat<br>with his tail hanging low.<br>His dark skin against the tile of walls<br>skudubg diwb kanebtubg tge deorecuatuib<br>in the quality of original sin.<br>He looked up at me as i raised my eyebrow<br>in a quizzical look and felt pitiful.<br>I asked him as to why he lingered<br>and he sighed as he produced a cigarette<br>from thin smokey air<br>and he explained to me.</p>
<p>""i look around everyday<br>to the seeds i harvested upon this earth<br>and notice their failure.<br>Yes... there is murder and tehre is lust,<br>there is greed and there is gluttony,<br>pride, and everything I so lovingly embrace.<br>Yet it saddens me the ignorance that surrounds evil's lips.""</p>
<p>And meaning in his words I tried to find despite my view<br>And from his words this meaning i drew:</p>
<p>There is good and there is evil,<br>one cannot exist withoug the other,<br>and when one falls, no real one prevails.</p>
<p>I watched his eyes shift<br>and watched the lonely figure lament the downfall<br>of the world.<br>he whispered between thoughts<br>to the effect of things such as pride.<br>HE said that nowadays everthing is just cowardice.<br>All the souls give up and commit suicide.<br>He no longer does a thing. He wanders through our paths<br>watching us destroy ourselves and brand him the scapegoat.<br>His black hair falls over his weary hands<br>as he hides his face from me.<br>He tells me he spends his days alone<br>and every once in a while he passes by his old friend<br>He tells me of their conversations.<br>He says he has given up, too,<br>and the world is still convinced their divine hands<br>continue to shape, but the truth is<br>both have let their gardens grow wild<br>and both have forgotten the meaning of it all.<br>He told me that God still says hello.<br>He told me I can find him still<br>on the blue line every Sunday night at 7:15.<br>He looked up at me and smiled.<br>I shook his hand and bid him farewell.<br>The train roared to a stop and I watched the masses get off.<br>I saw him disappear into the crowd.</p>

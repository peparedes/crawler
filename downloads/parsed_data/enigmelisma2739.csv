"event","So I went shopping tonight.... and was looking for a case of Cherry Coke (to repace the one nick bought that I finished....) and I found that <i>and</i> a case of TAB soda.... whoa.... to any of you who know of my Dr. Pop obsession... TAB soda was the original Dr. Pop, back before I could afford to buy soda myself, and before they stopped selling it all over the place.  I'm pretty excited by this find, and I think all of you should too.  I was going to buy multiple cases... but I could only find one... weird.  So in any case (get it?)... good times were had at Acme... and K-mart... and Staples... but mostly at Acme."

If they did, would that mean that they're the anti-christ and we've actually been fooled for the past few years into thinking that the rapture hasn't happened yet?

My first class is at 11 every day
except Thursday and Friday, when it's
9:30 and 10, respectively.
I therefore never see the hour
of 7am.
Yet, this week I saw
7am
twice. But from both sides.
On Monday, I stayed up late until 7am, then went to bed at
7:30 Tuesday morning.
Boy, was I tired that day.
On Thursday, which is today, I woke up at 6:30, in
order to eat breakfast at 7am.
Boy, am I tired this day.
In conclusion, 7am is a tired hour to be
awake at.
I recommend
avoiding it
at all cost.

free-verse poem about
7am

<marquee behavior=scroll direction=""right"">""Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. ~ Now we are engaged in a great Civil War testing whether that nation - or any nation so conceived and so dedicated - can long endure.  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.  We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.  It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this. ~ But in a larger sense: We cannot dedicate; we cannot consecrate; we cannot hallow this ground.  The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.  The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.  It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.  It is rather for us to be here, dedicated to the great task remaining before us: that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that the government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""</marquee>

"event","so basically.. it's 4am, it's snowing, and has been for a few hours, and I need to make the trek to WCU in the morning... will it work?  we'll find out soon enough!

so the final call is that I don't have a 'group' per se... I just am... and am is I... and I is that was me and me are the ends of I and what is is and what was was and everything in between is just your imagination."

"event","so... looking at journals of people I know... I realized how extremely varied the people are that I make friends with.  Like there are little circles of friends that I know that act in similar ways, and that shows through in their journals... and I wonder which, if any, group I fall into more than others... I don't know... if you'd like to claim me, let me know!"

In other news, it snowed last night, and it was awesome.  Yeah snow.  What if snow was a blue-green-ish color?  would it be as nice?  What color would you like to see snow be, and what color would you definitely not to see snow be? (like when it falls - no cop out answers like 'oh, I don't like yellow snow' trying to be cute and funny cause it's not cute <i>or</i> funny.)  Have fun to all!"

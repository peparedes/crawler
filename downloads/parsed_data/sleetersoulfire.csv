"event","Got this for Christmas and it's ace, with a few drawbacks. Primarily among them is that Marius has a very weird accent... it puts me off a bit. Fortunately he seems able to control it while Eponine's dying and so he doesn't ruin his most powerful scene. It's not like I have a favourite Marius which he's not imitating (unlike with Valjean). It's just that the accent is weird with a beard.

Another little bug I feel is that the Valjean character's performance in the first acts is too angry for me. I prefer it when he's crushed by the realization of what he's done to the priest, but this actor makes him furious about it and it loses its resonance for me. Oh, and don't get me started on his 'Bring Him Home' performance. It's just not that good. It's a song that, when sung well, is capable of giving me chills and bringing a tear to my eye every time. He gives the whole performance away. There's no passion, no desire. It should be Valjean begging God to intervene and save Marius but the way he sings it it's more 'feh, if you've nothing better to do, you know'. Maybe he has the same issues with Marius' accent and doesn't really want him saved?

Another thing is they take away Gavrosh's death. I love that bit and it's just gone totally.

Also, maybe it's just an inner racist inside me, but an American black man playing javert doesn't work in my head. Don't get me wrong, I close my eyes and he's a great singer who has quite a good control over his American accent when singing, so it's only a little bit off-putting, but I got a DVD, not a cast recording CD, so I want to watch it and the visuals make it harder to get involved. It's not right...

Matt Lucas is amazing as Thenardier though. Really cracking performance. I thought he was familiar when I first watched it and it wasn't until he took off his hat and I saw his shiny bald head that it clicked who he was.

Also... is it just me who thinks Cosette should be better looking than Eponine? In this one they got it close, Cosette and Eponine were about on par, looks-wise. Or maybe I'm wrong. Should Eponine be better looking and it expose the dick that Marius really is by him going for Cosette instead, just because she's a lady and Eponine is from the streets? I don't know. Whatever it's supposed to be, invariably I'd have been with Eponine rather than Cosette if I were Marius. ;)

Anyway, that's enough procrastinating and avoiding writing my essay for now..."

"event","<a href=""http://caramel-betty.livejournal.com/167168.html"">Caramel Betty's post on gaming and gamers</a> got me thinking and since I'd not updated this in a while, I decided to try and mould these thinkings into a post as a sort of 'I'm not dead yet' kind of thing.

<lj-cut text=""Body behind cut. Inform police."">I like open games. This needs to be said at the start. More often than not I will ignore 'campaign mode' in favour of 'sandbox mode' if there is a choice. I want to tell my own story in an RPG, not have one dictated to me. I want to build my own world/country/city/business in a construction simulation, not have my goals decided for me and have my reward be the game taking my work away from me and presenting me with a 'new challenge'.

This is why I love the Civilization games. Even after you 'win' you can still keep playing! I love that in a game. I love the Total War series of games too, because there's a lot of freedom to do as you please, build what you please, and make whatever tactical decisions you want.

For the same reasons I hate the Final Fantasy series. Every time I've played them they've always felt massively rigid, with a story being dictated to me while I tried to pretend I had a choice in what to do next. I never had a choice, and I never cared about the characters. They were never my characters, they were always someone else's. I didn't care if they died because the designers of the game didn't care what I wanted to do. Also, not being able to see my enemy before it jumped me always pissed me off no end.

So, what would I ideally want from a game? Well, one that cares what I want to do, what I am doing and which tries to foresee what I plan on doing. How would this manifest? Ideally if it's a Civilization-type game the tech trees shouldn't be so rigidly defined. I want the game to monitor what I'm building, and from me building them make me better at building them. Practice making perfect. So if I play as the Romans, there's an obvious path down a regimented, historical route where I focus on orgnaized infantry. But there's also options open where I could focus on breeding better horses, getting better cavalry, working on my bow technology and getting archers that make the rest of the world envious. What I'm getting at is that the tech trees should respond to what I actually do. So if I crush my citizens under my despotic boot, they should not develop things like printing presses - it shouldn't be an option if my society isn't free enough. Likewise, if I've never invested in training any horse units then the first mounted cavalry I make should suffer.

There should be things that the terrain of my cities changes too, so a nice river situated in a wide open plains area should be a different living experience for my citizens than a mountainous and rocky waste. My mountain-dwelling people should become hardier, while my river-side citizens should have and easier life and possibly become more wealthy and lazy as a result. If I prevent the free movement of my citizens then these should become more pronounced over time, while if I allow free movement then they should be very, very diluted features.

One thing that has bugged me for a long time about the Civ games, is that the cities stay as one square with two squares in each direction as their harvest zones. With improvements in transportation links the area from which a city can draw should become larger. Likewise an increase in population shoule be noticed in a spreading of the city from the square it started in. 10,000 poor, stone-age settlers shouldn't take up the same space as 10,000,000 industrial-era citizens. Of course, if these two features combined then there'd be no limit to city sizes, which there shouldn't be. Cities should grow and swallow nearby towns. It'd be awesome.

Anyway, I'm rabbiting. Jabber, jabber, jabber. :)"

"event","So, since I'm paying for an extra day's rental so I can get used to the car I figured I'd better stop twitching and gibbering in my room and go out and actually drive the blasted thing.

And it was FUN.

Vroom went the car, and without so many other cars about to interfere with vrooming, and without so much going on to distract me from learning how the car worked, it was a lot easier to get the feel of the car. I drove around Cardiff a bit, did some 60 roads, got lost, found a 24 hour Asda, put some fuel in the car, bought a beverage, vroomed some more, stuck to the speed limits like glue, got other motorists pissed at me for doing 40 (the speed limit) on a road that looks like it should be national speed limit (the give away that it's not is the 40 mile an hour signs... every few feet).

The car doesn't seem to have a point after which it stops accelerating. The road went from 30 to 60, so I put my foot down and the car went YIPPEE and flew off. Pulling like crazy, getting from 30 to 60 before I really knew what was going on. Up hill.

So... still gibbering, still giddy, had to park the car further away from the house so might not actually get any sleep tonight while I worry about it. But I had fun. Lots and lots of fun. Silly amounts of fun considering all I did was drive in a straight line, get lost trying to loop back around, fill the car a little and then find my way and get home."

"event","So, I got my first piece of feedback for the year. It was from my Black Political Thought essay which I wrote on Malcolm X. My tutor said I had a fresh take which showed evidence of original thinking and a personalized research approach, which made me happier than the 2.1 he gave me. He also said that with the inclusion of a discussion on the anti-neo-colonialist thought of X I could easily push my mark up to a first.

This has actually been a consistent theme of my feedback. Last year I wrote an essay on ontology and epistemology and was awarded a 1st for my unorthodox and interesting approach. Another essay I did was on humanitarian intervention which I got a 2.1 for and the comment that my approach was original and interesting. Another, on Descartes's Ontological Argument, I got a 1st for and was told that my use of Kant was bold and original and that it was scary for a first year student to even attempt Kant but that I'd done very well.

So, it would seem, I are original and unorthodox. Go me. ;)"

"event","Thanks to <lj user=""Caramel_Betty""> I am now sufficiently out of my dark and brooding mood to see that the failure of the Cardiff University electronic submission system and my lecturer's inability to reply to my e-mail before the deadline of 12:00 noon are not the end of the world.

I was aware all along that this essay 'doesn't count' because the module it's for is entirely exam based. However, when you've spent hours trawling through the bollocks written by creation 'scientists' because you're trying to answer the simple question ""Is creation science actually science?"" in more than one word (""No.""), it grates a little when you come to submit your essay and find that a .doc file is not a 'valid file format' for submission to the Cardiff University's electrionic submission system (despite the fact that my complaint about said system last year was answered with ""We're using TurnItIn instead this year"").

So, now I'm in a much better mood, I shall proceed with speed to the shops to get myself some food and await the reply to either the e-mail I sent to my lecturer at 19:00 last night, or the e-mail I sent at 11:00 this morning... or the e-mail I sent to the secretary at 11:50 because I was panicking.

Allons-y!"

"event","So, just took my driving theory test and passed it. Very nice thank you. Got a reasonable score too, considering I didn't revise for it at all and spent last night drinking Sailor Jerry rum (mmmm, ice-creamy) rather than doing any last minute revision.

To say I was shitting it on the way in would be an understatement. I was like Joey (from Friends) when he gets his lead role in Mac and Cheese... no preparation, just jumping in... stupid, but such a time saving way to go about it. :P

Anyway, got 46 out of 50 for the multiple choice section (pass is 43) and 61 out of 75 for the hazard perception (pass is 44).

So, by February next year I will (hopefully) be a fully qualified car driving type person.

Yay."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Cut for abusive and racist language, swearing, ranting, everything unpleasant in the world."">I have new housemates this year (oh and hai, since I hardly ever update this any more). Last year I was living with three Polish and one German, this year it's two Polish and two English.

This year my housemates (well, two of them) are pricks. Nationalistic, racist pricks too.

A collection of the less savoury things they've said:

""What would you rather your daughter marry: a filthy wog, a nigger, or a nice Polish boy?""
""They should just fucking kill all the Jews, they're useless anyway.""
""You [my female housemate Chloe] can't tell me you'd rather go out with a fucking packie than a nice white guy?""
""I fucking hate City Road. Hate it. So many fucking wogs and packies and fucking niggers. I can't stand walking down it. Fuck. And it fucking stinks! Oh my god, packies stink, wogs stink, niggers stink.""

Couple that with a complete inability to understand that there's a certain etiquette to sharing a house, certain unwritten rules, guidelines if you will, which make the experience even slightly enjoyable. Chief among these is that you and your friend isn't a fucking party. It doesn't require you to play music at full blast all night, doesn't require you to turn your music on when you get in from your party at 5:40 in the morning because you've decided that you're not going to sleep. The rest of us want to fucking sleep!

The last time this particular friend came over you generated complaints from the Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Which YOU didn't have to deal with! I had to deal with them! The letting agents got complaints from all three nights and I was the one they call. I'm always the one they call for everything, but I especially don't like being kept up until 4:00 on a Monday morning only to be called at 9:30 with the complaint about you that I wanted to make! But of course, because she'd told me, despite the fact that I told her it was you, she didn't call you. No. That would just be stupid. After all, I complain that you didn't fucking listen to me when I told you to knock it the fuck off hence why she has the complaint. It's clear that I can stop you doing it again... oh, wait, no I can't because you're both pricks.

The other morning they came in at 4:00 after a night out and put their music on full blast. I came down to ask them to STFU and they were already answering the door to the neighbours asking the same thing. So I put in my ""STFU pls"" and went back to bed, hoping that a double whammy of STFU would do something to you, make you think. No. I was down again less than half an hour later because you were playing Call of Duty at full volume. I stood at your door and knocked it six times before just walking in and standing there, saying your names. It wasn't until one of you looked around that you SAW me and turned down the volume to see what I wanted. Guess what? IF YOU CAN'T HEAR YOUR DOOR BEING KNOCKED OR SOMEONE IN THE SAME ROOM TALKING AT NORMAL VOLUME THEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING FAR TOO FUCKING LOUD FOR ANY TIME, LET ALONE 4:30 IN THE FUCKING MORNING YOU PRICKS!!!!!!!!!ONE!1ZFIGSAG;KLJ;SDJKLLJKHGAOIHG

I have to keep reminding myself that it has nothing to do with the two of you being Polish. Just because I had a couple of noise problems last year with my Polish housemates (amazingly whenever the two of you were visiting) doesn't make it a problem with Polish people. It makes it a problem with you two pricks.

Also, guess what? No I don't care about Polish (or 'niggers' or 'wogs' or any other ethnic or national slur you care to use for which ever people you don't like) people coming here to find work. If they're willing to work and can get employed then fair play to them. We'd go to Poland to find jobs too if it wasn't such a cess pool (opinion based on pictures and movies of Poland shown to me with pride by the many Polish people I've met over the last 14 months). I don't see you coming here as a bad thing. It's a good sign, the bad sign being that the rates are dropping and may even have reach a negative figure of people going back home because of the state we're in. You coming here means my country is better than yours, dill holes. People don't go from good places to bad places, they go from bad places to good places. That's how it works. If what you want is sun, you don't move from Florida to Skeggy, you move from Skeggy to Florida. If what you want is to have a reasonable chance at a well paying job you move your ass from Poland to the UK (at least, until recently). That you're here 'stealing' UK jobs doesn't make you awesome and me a loser. It makes you the loser, from the loser country, coming to the awesome country and by your own fucked up logic, that makes me the awesome one.

Another thing. A lot of countries have had empires. Poland's wasn't that great. The reason we don't learn about it in school here is exactly those reasons combined. We had our own, which we learn about. We learn (well, I did in my school, your results may vary) a little about Alexander the Great's, a little about the Mongolian empire and a shit load about the Roman empire. The fact that your empire lasted 200 years doesn't make it better than and more worthy of learning about than Alexander's. What made Alexander's worthy of study was that he did it all before he died at 32 years old. An incredible achievement, even by modern mobilised warfare standards. I can't remember the bull shit reason you gave why it was more worthy of study than the Roman empire, I can just remember laughing at you. Your racist reasons for not studying the Mongolian empire were just tragic. But, I went away, I studied your 'amazing Polish empire' and I was so less than impressed that it wasn't even amusing how nationalistic your outlook is. Sure, it lasted a while. Yes, it fought and won a few wars. Great. It was relatively small (and I now see why my ""Great, so what, Britain had an empire that they said the sun never set on, doesn't mean anything"" shut you up, because your empire was a small corner of Eastern Europe, not even over two time zones) it achieved a few things, but was actually relatively weak and boring, hence why it lasted so long, hence why it isn't studied in British schools.

So, Alek the Fascist, Mathaus the Nazi (Nazi chosen because while he supports many of Hitler's key aims, he doesn't like Nazis because they beat Poland into burger meat) and Mikau the pot head (you seem like a nice guy and rarely say anything because you're so stoned, but you're always there when the music goes over the top). All in all, what I guess I'm trying to say, is STFU."

"event","So, I've just finished Mass Effect and I have to say that the game has something. The number of times I turned it off in frustration at the moronic actions of my squad, the slow, slow lifts, the crazy controls of the all terrain vehicle, the linear nature of the story, the wooden acting and painful dialogue, etc., etc., and yet I completed it. Every time I turned it off I was back on it shortly afterwards, determined to get past the next bit. 13 hours of gaming and I finished it.

I have to say that I am now very annoyed that I can't actually go back and fill in the little side missions which I skipped because I was drawn in by the ever urgent insistence of the games wooden narrative. Of course, I always arrived just in time to save the day and just miss capturing the bad guy. About half way through it did dawn on me that the game wasn't actually time based, I could spend how ever long I liked lost in one of the stupid, poorly mapped sections and as soon as I emerged I would be in time to do my bit. Never did I run around and around in circles for thirty minutes and emerge to find everything was over, all the people were dead and the mission lost. But I let myself be swept up in the pace demanded by the narrative, the urgency it wanted.

It's a game format I normally hate. At the mid-point battle with the bad guy I'd totally kicked his ass. I mean, completely. My squad and I were on full health and full shields. He was on a sliver of health. Then the cut scene kicks in and my guys are lying down unconcious and I'm writhing around while the bad guy stomps around triumphant. ""Huh,"" thinks I, ""I'm sure that you were one bullet away from biting the big one..."" but no, the story insisted I'd just been bested and was lucky to be alive. That pissed me off no end and earnt the game a good hard turning off.

The dialogue also leaves a lot to be desired. Because you can do the missions in any order as you see fit the dialogue is difficult to write. I accept that. The writers want to reveal at the right momrnt and so can't have someone on the ship just blurt it out and give the game away. However, I shouldn't be confused about what's happening when I've done the 'stop being confused and find out' bit. But because the dialogue can be accessed at any time, I have to be... ""I wonder what bad guy wants?"" Um... I know, I've just found out... no option for ""You were just on the planet where we found out"" so I have to play dumb. Also it seemed that, for most of the conversations, it didn't actually matter what I said (or wanted to say) at all, the story proceeded along its rails and I was swept along. I often choose the pissed off one and the person carried on regardless. 

Despite this I've finished the game and have even started it through again so I can do the mini missions before stomping my way through the main missions again. I kept going back to it and I'm not sure why. There is a certain something about the game which got in my head and I think it's the attention to TechGuff. I like a game that tries to TechGuff explanations for stuff rather than just shrugging and telling you not to ask. Because of the internal consistency (except their inability to use the mass effect fields to MAKE THE LIFTS GO FASTER!!!) I believed that this technology was possible and so bought much of the TechGuff with relish. I enjoyed reading about how and why stuff worked. I enjoyed finding new TechGuff to read about. There was a lot of it which was just fun and wasn't ashamed of being fun.

Very good game, all in all. Although I am still waiting for the game where I don't start out as a chosen and super special person right from the off and have to make my own way. I want to start out as a raw recruit and earn promotion. I want to have no responsibility until I've earnt it. I want it to be possible to actually fail and for the failure to impact the story rather than failure meaning I have to just do-over that part of the story. I'd love a game that starts me off as a raw recruit, the tutorial being boot camp, then puts me in missions where I have choices, proceed and succeed at the given mission gaining credit, go above and beyond the mission and get recognition, or fail at the mission and get chastised. Possibly even get access to sekrits and then defect! Real options. Of course, such a game would probably be monsterously epic to make. Still, I can dream.

ADDITIONAL: Why were there so many merchants in the game? I bought one piece of armour, one gun and the upgrades for the medigel and grenades, and that was it. Without doing all the side missions I was able to amass all the weapons and armour I needed to fit out my crew and still had enough left over to sell for monster bucks (which I didn't then use, but that's not the point ;). I can't imagine how much money I'd have had by the end if I'd done all of the side missions in the game and collected the loot which would come with those missions... I stopped selling towards the end as I could find no use for the money at all, only to find that there was a 150 item limit and so I had to omnigel some nice loot which would have sold for quite a nice amount of cash. Ah well.

So, who's going to suggest my next X-Box RPG adventure? ;)"

"event","I bought Grand Theft Auto IV because my house mate, Jakob, was raving about it for so long. I like the GTA games, don't get me wrong, but I wanted to wait for it to come down in price a bit before getting my grubby mits on it.

I'd seen some trailers for Saints Row II and it looked great. I then read that there was almost total character customisation and thought I had to get it!

After a few dozen hours I have to say I prefer GTA4. I love the customisation of SR2, I love the outfits you can put together, the way you can tailor the colours to your exact taste, the way you can even change your underwear and socks to fit what you want. However, the physics are terrible. I drive a sports car into a tree at top speed I expect that car to be history, or as close to history as possible. I don't expect to be able to slap it into reverse and shoot off.

I like GTA4's controls better too. The cars handle like cars, rather than like weird alien tech which is magnetically connected to the road. I like that the acellerator and breaks are on the trigger buttons and can be applied either a little or a lot. The SR2 option of using the digital buttons means you're either foot to the floor or you're not, there's no gentle middle ground.

I also like GTA4 because, between missions, I feel like it's actually real. Sure, the missions are forced and artificial (such as one mission where I was to assassinate a hoodrat, the mission clearly wanted me to confront him man to man but I wanted to snipe his ass and get on with things, as soon as the sniper sight went near him he ducked for cover and ran), but the free game is wonderful. Popping in to the comedy club and watching a show is ace, being able to do everything you want without having to enter a spcial, artificial, contrived mode is bliss.

I really like SR2's reputation system, where everything 'cool' you do gets some recognition. You're driving at top speed in the wrong lane? Cool, have some rep. You're weaving in and out of cars without hitting them at top speed? Cool, have some rep. You've just launched your car into space off a jump? Cool, have some rep. The notoriety system needs some work, but there are aspects of it that I like more than the star system in GTA4. For example, if you hide where the police can't get you, it shouldn't matter if it's just over the road or ten blocks away, you're lying low and that should count. It does in SR2, not so in GTA4, you just need to escape the circle and stay out of it for a little while. I didn't like that I could stay just ahead of a cop and have them eventually give up the chase though. Needs work, but it's more interesting than the GTA version.

I think I want a melding of these two games. The reality and physics of GTA4 with the customisation of SR2. The ability to choose my character, to customise the look and attitude of that character, and the ability to have them dress exactly how I like was great. GTA4 seems to have less of this fun than its previous incarnations had, which makes me wonder if they maybe wanted to bring out the new engine more than they wanted to expand on the games they'd made previously.

If I had to give one of these games away, it would be SR2. I can go back to GTA4 over and over, but SR2 seems to already be gathering dust on my shelf and I've not had it even half as long as I've had GTA4."

"event","So, around September time I bought an X-Box 360. I went into the store with the intention of buying a shiny new toy and was torn between the PS3, Wii and the 360. My heart wanted the Wii, my head wanted the 360 and ... possibly my lungs wanted the PS3. Some part of me wanted the familiar, as I've a PS2 and the PS of the PS3 would have been comforting. However, a quick price comparison showed that the PS3 came with less for much more, so it was ruled out fairly quickly.

Fear then grabbed my heart and the 'innovative' controls of the Wii scared me. Fear that which is different children! Fear it and shun it!

So I was left with the 360.

I got a few previously owned games (Spiderman 3, Oblivion, Assassins Creed, etc) and it came with Mirror's Edge. I picked up Fifa 2009 on a special offer and got an extra control pad with it. Sweet.

I also picked up Fable 2. That game was awesome. The story was fun, the controls were easy and the fighting wasn't too taxing, had lots of options so wasn't too repetative. You could also buy a vast array of clothing options for your character and although you were stuck with a choice of a guy or a girl with preset features, the customisation between evil and good, pure or corrupt, etc while in game was amazing. An RPG with pretty much everything I wanted in an RPG, in fact. It got a little boring though and was very easy to complete because the fights never really got any more difficult than the first few bugs you had to kill (except for the werewolves, who jumped over you, but with a little timing I was able to smack them as they landed without too much trouble).

Good choice! Recently I've had the chance to play quite a lot with a Wii and I'm very happy that I chose the 360. The Wii is fun, but it is more fun with a group of people than it is on your own, and the controls chafe. So not a great choice for someone who wants to use the consol mostly on his own and doesn't want to constantly be pissed off that the games don't make enough use of the different control system (or make use of it in a very annoying and pointless way)!

Go go 360 power!!!"

"event","I went to see the new Star Trek last night. I was dubious, but my house mate invited me and there were a bunch of people I knew going to see it so I went. I was fearful it was going to be like the original series, which I hate.

From the first moments it's nothing like TOS, it's amazing.

I mean, wow. Incredible!

Everyone should go and see this film! It's one of the best films I've ever seen, of any kind. It's got mind blowing special effects, amazing actions sequences, gripping and entertaining fight sequences, a fantastic story line, wonderful acting. It's funny, moving and witty. It's got the whole package and it brought extra for everyone.

I was gripped from the moment it started to the moment it ended. I didn't feel let down or cheated at the end like I do with so many big budget films, I was satisfied, content with what had been shown, excited and buzzing.

Seriously, WATCH THIS FILM! Now. Go to the cinema, now, and watch it. Go. Shoo! It doesn't matter if you should be at work, or making love to the most attractive person alive. Go and see this film. It will be worth it."

I went in to the politics office, as I was asked to do by the politics secretary, Karan Owen. A short chat later and it turns out that the exam board have not yet made their decision on whether or not my essay marks will count, but my essays have actually been marked and are being checked, so I will at least have feedback on how I did.

She seemed confident that, because I was able to submit seven essays correctly, the board would accept that it wasn't my fault that the essays didn't submit correctly. Having accepted that they would then be willing to allow my essay mark to count this time. However, she did make it clear that it was in the laps of the Exam Gods, who being fickle and quick to anger, may well decide to smite me instead. So it could go either way."

"event","If you could choose one person, alive or dead, to have a really good debate with, who would it be and why?

For me it would have to be Whoopi Goldberg. In my opinion she manages to say things which I disagree with in such a way that they don't actually leave me wanting to either hurt her or throw up. She is able to have a debate, get her point across, listen to the other point and make cutting comments. But the best thing about her is that all the time she maintains an air of affable good humour.

Also, I do agree with a great many things she says, but she comes at concepts and ideas from such an unusual position that even having a debate with her in which we agreed would be a fascinating and worthwhile thing to do.

I've always liked Whoopi, from her acting in various films and from the Biography Channel's piece on her, but having just spent an hour watching clips of her on The View, I am more certain than ever that I could spend a very, very long time debating every issue under the sun with her and never get bored or so frustrated that I'd have to leave the room. Especially as she seems to live the idea that you can be 'wrong' (read, 'disagree with me') yet still be a good person. You can be 'wrong' but still be worth talking with. You can be 'wrong' and not be insulted for that.

However, as we all know, the way TV presents people is always false, so she's probably some form of hideously derranged mutant and it's just clever editing and witty script writers that keep it from coming out on air. Right? ;)"

There are, broadly speaking, three types of zombie. The shambler, the runner and the rage zombie. Generally the zombie will seek to spread the catalyst for becoming a zombie on to humans around them. Most often this catalyst takes the form of a virus transmitted through bites or blood to blood contact.

Although maiming a zombie of any form will slow it down, the only way of stopping/killing a zombie is to destroy its brain. The most effective way of achieving this is a shotgun blast, but most other firearms will provide enough power to stop a zombie, as will other weapons such as chainsaws, axes and knives.

The Shambler.

Shamblers are the least scary type of zombie. As their name suggests they move at slow speeds, act with only minimal (almost sub-animal) intelligence and are easy to escape. Although they are capable of sudden lunges, if they catch you then it's probably a case of evolution (you're either too stupid or too weak/injured to survive in the wild).

Shamblers may work in weakly aligned groups, relying on weight of numbers to overrun beseiged humans.

The shambler, because it's so slow, can be dispatched either with projectiles or with melee weapons, such as axes. They're the easiest to deal with and pose minimal threat to human civilisation. The only realistic way this form of zombie would be able to spread is if the virus which causes the zombie state was air-born and infects people, causing them to rise from the dead however they might happen to die. The zombies job thefore isn't to spread the virus, but to kill people in order for them to rise from the dead and become more zombies.

Shamblers would cause a short period of panic and death before they were brought under control. Once order was again restored either a cure for the zombie virus would be found, or basic safety measures would be implemented of destroying the brain of all newly deceased individuals.

The Runner.

The runner is also of low intelligence, although slightly greater than the shambler. They are able to move at the average human running speed which makes them a much more deadly strain of zombie. Because of their swift movement they can easily overrun a position in a few moments, meaning that the best defence against this variety of zombie is to keep moving in some form of motorised transport capable of getting ahead of them and losing them.

Runners, like shamblers, are likely to start to form groups, but their ability to swarm quickly over positions means they're likely to form a much higher degree of threat to civilisation. However, because of their low intelligence and their inability to climb or to form coherent attack groups, they are unlikely to succeed in infecting every human. Once people become aware of the dangers and learn the weaknesses of the stupid runners they will have little trouble evading and destroying them.

Rage Zombies.

By far and away the most terrifying of all zombie strains. The rage zombie is marginally faster than an average human due to the virus granting them increased strength. They are able to run for longer due to their lack of concern for their own safety or wellbeing. They are also mindlessly and uncontrolably violent. Unlike the shamblers and runners, the rage zombie is able to think on a par with a young child and is therefore able to resolve simple problems, making them even more deadly. Unlike the other types of zombie, the rage zombie will also beat against any object between them and their target without any concern for the damage caused to their body, meaning they're able to break into much stronger barricades and safe houses.

The combination of ferocious rage, increased strength and speed, increased (over other zombie types) intelligence, and lack of regard for their own continued existence, the rage zombie is a much more deadly threat to civilisation.

So What?

Well, Jakob and I have argued at some length over whether zombies should run. He says that you have to go with tradition and have shamblers. Arguing that a running zombie isn't a zombie at all and is something else. I disagree because zombies should be scary, and in more ways than just the way they look and smell. There should be a chance of them catching you, which there isn't with a shambler in any non-moronic way.

I think that the movie <i>28 Days Later</i>, with the rage zombies, totally ruined any movie with shamblers in it for me. The fierce and savage nature of the zombies in it really woke me up to the fact that a shambling zombie that you can jog around isn't scary. A zombie you don't break a sweat getting away from isn't scary. A zombie you can expect to easily dispatch with an axe isn't scary.

Isn't it amazing what a person can accomplish while avoiding writing their essay? ;)"

Although there were a lot of people there who said stuff like ""Hi! I'm [insert character created in the last four years that Sleeter doesn't recognise]"" there were enough people there who I knew (Tomas, Juan, Lexx, Yalpf, Commando, Shambles, Helen, Clio, etc, etc, etc) that it was great. :D

Actually, the number of people there that Juan, Tomas, Commando and I didn't know actually made it quite entertaining. The bitter complaints about all the newbies was good fun in itself.

I spent more than I wanted to while there, but that's always the case, isn't it?

Instead I was on full fat coke, Doritoes and Pringles, chashews and peanuts, Quality Streets and Lindt chocs, and bacon/sausages/etc for meals. We also hit the chippy for the largest donner meat and chips I've ever seen and had several meals at the local pub.

Suffice to say there wasn't a moment over those three weeks when I didn't feel full to the brim and slightly sick.

EDIT: 13:58, 50 minutes after having got back home. I have now attached the little D-Lock holdy bit and found there are no appropriate places on my bike for the holdy bit for the 'chain' thingy, so it's nicely tucked away in the Old Fashioned Way. It was good enough for me when I was 10, it's good enough for me now! All this new fangled gizmo technology. I remember when it was all nowt but fields!

Also, I had a lie down. Seriously, I was fux0red after 3.2 miles (having used Google Maps to plot in the actual route I took it turns out it was further than 2.6).

The start of my journey was downhill (I bought the bike from Don Skene Cycles in Rumney). Experience has now taught me that going quickly downhill is a bad time to test out the breaks of your new bike..."

Just wondering how totally baked your economy needs to get for you to need to print a $100 trillion note (equivalent to $30 US, according to the BBC, $300 US according to CNN).

The US is massively in debt. However, the whole of the United States is only $10.5 trillion in debt. Why would an individual need a single note of the value of $100 trillion?

It's more crazy than I'd previously thought. A loaf cost $300 billion at the time of that article. However, at 230 million percent inflation, that's already going to cost quite a lot more than it did.

They're also running an 80% unemployment rate and most people want to be paid in US/South African currency (it's likely that pebbles are more in demand than the country's currency)."

"event","I've been watching a lot of DVDs recently and have treated myself to series 8 of Red Dwarf, the only one I've been missing and the one most people tell me is the best series of them all.

I'd never seen it before. I found it rather disappointing, to be honest. Returning to the 'bunk format' was welcome as I'd always enjoyed the banter back and forth and didn't really mind when they wildly deviated from the story to chat about crazy and stupid stuff. But the majority of it was a little lacking. There wasn't that spark which they had in the first few series. I think I mostly enjoyed the idea that these two had a city sized ship to explore and have adventures in. When you reduce that to Starbug then it gets a little less interesting, but when you restrict that to one floor of the ship, which is a prison then it loses all that fantasy element and gets tied down to something all together too 'real' for the crazy stuff to work. For me anyway."

<lj-cut text=""A little bit more behind the cut"">Although I really like the film I do wonder why the Joker, clearly a schemer (how do you manage to smuggle enough explosives into prison/a hospital/a boat/where ever without being noticed if you don't have a damn good plan?), hates schemers so much. You don't get results that good <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy"">Indy Ploying</a> your way through life. You don't just casually sneak demolition explosives into a hospital, for example. You need people on the inside. You need to know where to lay your explosives. An Indy Ploy doesn't go far enough into the future to get those things organised. You have to scheme.

Anyway, watch this film!"

"event","I'm going to Leicester over the Christmas period. My mum has arranged a job for me where she works which has reasonable pay, which is nice. She's also arranged a birthday party for me on the 14th in the upstairs function room of the local pub. By the sounds of it half of Leicester are invited, ranging from family and old friends to people I met once when I was 5 years old... so it should be nice and awkward as I tell person after person that I've no clue who they are. Beaut.

<lj-cut text=""Journey ranting cut..."">Interestingly it seems like I've managed booked a return journey which doesn't exist. I've been searching for the departure time from Leicester (the second and third leg tickets have times on them, the Leicester to Bristol leg doesn't) and have noticed something Interesting and ever-so-slightly Disturbing about my supposed travel times... I depart Bristol for Birmingham at 11:10 and depart Birmingham for Cardiff at 14:30. The trip from Bristol to Birmingham takes 1 hour 20... what the FUCK am I going to do in Birmingham for 2 hours? As if that's not bad enough, the train that gets me to Bristol for an 11:10 transfer leaves Leicester at 00:29 in the morning... seriously. The next train from Leicester is at 11:18 and misses Bristol out, getting me to Birmingham at 12:30. I guess my first leg ticket is actually valid for a one stop journey, since it states that it's Leicester to Cardiff, rather than Leicester to Bristol Parkway. If it is then I can just get the 13:19 from Leicester to Birmingham and then get my booked 14:30 Birmingham to Cardiff train, thus only being in Birmingham for 15 minutes.

Advice for the day: Never call the CSR drones at TheTrainLine. Ever, ever again. The woman I got was massively unhelpful (""Sir, without an exact travel time I cannot help you."" Funny how I was perfectly able to help myself with the stipulation of leaving Leicester 'some time before 14:00') and booked me a seriously messed up journey without happening to mention ""Okay then sir, this journey has you leaving Leicester at half-past midnight, waiting in Bristol for eleven hours, then traveling to Birmingham where you'll wait another two hours before finally arriving home for a total journey time of sixteen hours, is that okay with you?"" To which I would have screamed down the phone FUCK YEAH, LADY! I ALWAYS WANTED TO SPEND THE BEST PART OF A DAY TRAVELLING A TINY FUCKING DISTANCE! I only called because their lame website refused to accept my card details."

"event","Yesterday my French house mate threw a Christmas party with a multicultural theme, and it was awesome.

I provided sausage rolls, then we had a Polish beetroot soup with meat parcels in, then a chicken and carrot Belgian dish and a Czech sweet bread thingy for desert, each of which I really enjoyed. Then they made a hot spiced beer with honey (I think Polish) which was rank. But you can't enjoy everything.

My house mate also bought everyone in the house presents, which was so nice of her.

Oh, and I also finished the last of this term's essays today, which is even more awesomeness!"

"event","As some will know, I'm living in a house with four other students at the moment. Sometimes they have their music on while I'm trying to study (not loud, but the house likes to share). I don't want to ask them to turn off their music, because it's their home too.

I find it hard to work when I can just about hear something. It distracts me as I try to figure out what I can hear, what song is being played, which show is on the TV, etc.

What I'd like is to have some gentle music to play when they're playing theirs. Something which wont distract me from my work (so nothing with lyrics) but will be there to counter the low level noise coming from the other rooms of the house. This is where I hit my snag. The music that I have been drawn to all my life has been music with lyrics, since I value the themes and content of what is said more than the music that accompanies it.

Does anyone out there in InterWebNetLand have any suggestions? Anything I could try out to see if it works? I am open to any suggestions at all."

"event","I like having a brand new toothbrush. Why? Because it feels naughty and wrong. It feels like I'm using something which isn't mine and which I shouldn't use. I feel like an outlaw on the cusp of society, breaking the rules and thumbing my nose at social conventions...

Then I realise it's my toothbrush and the mad rush of power and non-conformity ends and I carry on brushing my teeth.

"event","So my first essay results are in.

The question was: ""Why is it appropriate to describe the presocratics as philosophers?"" The result might count towards 30% of my first year mark in Intro to Mind, Thought and Reality (I get another attempt, the better of two essays is counted).

I got 64%, which I was more than happy with, given that I didn't feel like I'd fully got to grips with the question. There were a lot of notes and a lot of 'facts' which I'd taken from my reading which my tutor disagreed with, but such is life. 64% is 64%!

I'm mostly done with my reading for my next essay too, so all is going well on the study front!"

"event","So, Obama won, and won well.

I was watching the events as they unfolded and was strangely dispassionate about the whole thing. Obama won Ohio and New Mexico and the American commentators were calling it, but I still didn't believe. I didn't believe until the counter broke 270 with the arrival of the result from Washington. Then I cried.

Why did I cry about a result which was in the bag hours before? Why did I cry about a man who's going to lead another country, who I couldn't choose, who I had no say in becoming president? Well, I guess it's because, for the first time in my political life the candidate I wanted to win, won. For the first time in history America has a black president and a black first family. For the first time in history we have a fixed place to point to and say ""See, they aren't as bad as those against them would have us believe.""

I also cried because he's going to fail. The expectations on him will be higher than he could have achieved with a favourable economy and with a good strong wind in his favour. He can't fix the mess that the US is facing. I fear he will get one term and ever after people will discount black candidates with the line ""Remember Obama?"" as short hand for remember when we dreamed so high and hoped so hard and were again dissappointed?

I cried when the crowd greeted him onto the stage with a chant of ""Yes We Can"". Because I don't believe it. I hope so hard that they can, but I can't see it happening. Maybe I should drop such cynicism, since I couldn't see Obama winning in the first place. Maybe they can. Maybe we can...

I still have the gut feeling that the Republican brass spoke to McCain and told him that they didn't want to win. That they wanted the Democrats to be marred by the financial meltdown. That they wanted to sit this term out and wait in the wings shouting abuse at the way the Democrats fail to solve the problems before swooping in at the start of the upturn to take back the presidency and crow about how the recovery is all their doing. It explains why he chose Palin, why he changed from the McCain people wanted into just another Republican, why he did the things he did which alienated and angered and confused people.

Sure, Palin 'energies the base', but as can be seen, I think, from the election results, your base is your base for a reason, they don't need much energising. When the economy predictably killed your campaign you can't argue that your base needed energising at the expense of your economic policy.

The real McCain was the one giving the concession speech. The man who is humble and gracious. Who believes in America's better qualities. The man campaigning wasn't the same man.

As with a whole host of other things, I hope to hell I'm wrong. I hope Obama is the man for the hour. I hope he has a solid course to steer America through. I hope he knows what he's doing and I hope he does it right. I don't think he can possible handle the ship he's in charge of though."

"event","Today was very uneventful, except that it rained so hard I didn't go to my last class, becuase I didn't think getting struck by lightening was worth a computer class.  That and I didn't feel like drowning in the big puddles, so I just waited the storm out in the library.  I feel am worrying about Megan because she is going through a hard time with her parents divorce.  I talked to her and told her about my expierence when my parents split up.  It was hard a first, but after a while it got easier by the day, all I knew was I had my mommy and that's all that mattered.  Now I have been getting really depressed lately; just thinking about all the shit that goes wrong in my life, and my dad is the one thing that keeps standing out! It pisses me off becuase I don't want to think about him, I hate him, yet I can't stop, what did I do? Not exist enough for him?  But anywho, I am going now because I am tired and being depressed does that."

"event","OK tonight has been very interesting. I got this IM from someone I don't know.  I end up finding out that he IMed me because ""a friend"" of mine was in a chat room talking about how I was having a bad time dealing with coming out.  I don't mean my ""friend"" any harm, but I don't think that my problems are for everyone to know about.  So now I hope I don't start getting IM's and e-mails from strangers.  Now I am paranoid *looks around*."

"event","This is so cool, my first journal entry! *Jumps for joy*.  Ouch! I forgot about that ceiling, again.  Well today was a rather uneventful day, but then again it was not a bad uneventful day so I guess that makes up for it all.  I was kinda stressing this morning because I thought that I had an Spanish quiz, and lets face it I did not study for it and I was confused because the professor gave us like forty verbs and is like, ""Here are a few words to learn, it should not be too hard""  I am like my booty!  So yesterday I meet my friend Justin in the library at FSC and showed him everything we did in class that day, Oh yeah he skipped the class yesterday (reason unknown) I think he said something like paying his pimp some money that he owed him or whatever...(just kidding Justin).  Well anyway so I showed him the stuff we learned and the homework we had and then told him we had a quiz tomorrow (which is today).  Following so far? Well anyway, then I study my ass off last night to find out that hey I was wrong the quiz is not until Friday!  I was like wha!  Then I was happy, and the quiz is not even over what I thought, it's just over easy crap!  So I am glad about that.  Other then that nothing life changing happened.  One thing I a worrying about is my english essay I have to write about tomorrow, like who care about transendalism? I don't!  I am happy for Megan she seems happy, because of this guy named Ryan and now she is talking to Brad again so she is P.I.M.P.'n.  I am now on the phone with Erika now, she is talking about her boyfriend, I swear she is never going to be in a long term relationship she pushes them all away lol... crazy.  I wish I had someone to push away! lol.  I find myself the only one alone, and it sucks, but I think it's all due to the fact that I want a relationship really badly.  Like I said to Justin maybe I should just leave it alone and wait.  It may just smack me in the face...or ass...hehehe. well that's it for now."

There are some things i want to tell the world, some things i don't and other things i want to tell the world but know i shouldn't.  See my dilema?

Good, now that that's out of the way...I'll just say i'm in love"

"event","This is a gigantic poem i've been writing over the past week or so.  It's not music, just poetry.  and it shows my shifting moods.  I do think it gives a good overall view of my feelings right now.  It's about confusion, and pain, and anger and love.  So dont ask me ""if it means this"" the answer is yes and no.  Just take it as it is.  This poem is dedicated to everyone...so yes, you should all probably read this.  This is NOT..and i repeat NOT directed at anyone person..though a couple more than others.

COLD AND BITTER

I'm locked in my house
but kicked out of home
unseen and unheard
I'm all but alone

A freak in your nature
corrupt the seren
you go white when you see red
I AM the obscene

It's really a disorder
disguised as depression
never been diagnosed
but it's all a digression

I've been used and lied to
a lifelong disgrace
I try to open up to you
but you spit back in my face

Why do you blame me
for being who i am?
Why must i be like all the others
i can only be one man

I won't cut my hair
I won't wear your fucking clothes
I'll paint my nails
I'll pierce my fucking nose

I don't care if you don't like my music
I honestly don't give a shit what you think
You constantly criticize me
and i get closer and closer to the brink

You damned me with faint praise
but even now that's a memory
You're not the be all and end all
but i still care about how it USED to be

You still believe
all the fake rumours you heard
But when you hear me speak the truth
I'm ""too disgusting for words""

And i think i'm learning to hate you
and i think that's what i want
cause i'm sick of writing you love songs
'bout the ""good old days"", in pretty fonts

I'm of two minds about it all
my conscience torn to shreds
I love, but i'm afraid to love you
am i better off being dead?

I started off by acting civil
but that game's getting old
And now I've learned how not to feel
my heart is growing cold

I'm never really happy
I simply hide my pain
I can't get close to anyone;
it's driving me insane

I've forgotten how to love
I've forgotten how to hate
I've forgotten how to smile
Is this to be my fate?

Don't believe all that you see
Can you see my disguise?
Use your heart, don't use your eyes
Your vision speaks in lies

I'm not asking you to love
just accept me as I am
I never meant to hurt you
and I'm trying the best I can

I'd never hurt you purposely
I'd kill myself for you
It's crossed my mind, and now I think
It might be what i want to do

I'm knicked, i'm cut, I'm nine months dead
and feeling comes so hard
I'll lay myself down on the grass
and bleed upon the yard

I'm cold and bitter, i hate it all
but learning to forgive
But i want to disappear i want to forget
So please, just let me live"

"event","BEFORE YOU READ THESE LYRICS:  I am putting in here mainly cause they are incredibly beautiful.  I AM NOT putting them in here for anyone or concerning anyone.  It may be because i have loved before and i have felt the way the lyrics portray.  Maybe i kinda feel that way about life.  I dunno its a beautiful song.

Dido - White Flag

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you, 
Or tell you that. 
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it 
where's the sense in that? 
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder 
Or return to where we were 

But I will go down with this ship 
And I won't put my hands up in surrender 
There will be no white flag above my door 
I'm in love and always will be 

I know I left too much mess and 
destruction to come back again 
And I caused nothing but trouble 
I understand if you can't talk to me again 
And if you live by the rules that it's over 
then I'm sure that that makes sense 

But I will go down with this ship 
And I won't put my hands up and surrender 
There will be no white flag above my door 
I'm in love and always will be 

And when we meet 
Which I'm sure we will 
All that was then 
Will be there still 
I'll let it pass 
And hold my tongue 
And you will think 
That I've moved on.... 

I will go down with this ship 
And I won't put my hands up and surrender 
There will be no white flag above my door 
I'm in love and always will be"

"event","So, i've been getting questions from people such as ""who is this catie girl that i keep hearing so much about in your live journal?""  Well i figure its about time i tell you.

Catie, in a nutshell is one of the most amazing people no the face of the planet.  I'm sure you think i speak in jest, but i kid you not.  She's fantastic.  She's beautiful and intelligent and talented.  We dated for an intense four months, and although things didn't end too well and we've been on and off since then, things are beginning to look up.

I dont know if i still love her not.  I think i do.  Sometimes i think i'm over her.  But other times i think i couldn't love any other.  I don't know what's going to happen between us in the future, but we're friends again, and we hang out and things are almost normal.  Things are looking up, and i can't stop thinking about her.  She's incredible.

So catie, this is for you.  I'm not sure to what degree, but i love you."

Nothing extraordinary (that comes later in the year) and Michael Weinstein (music teacher) now has a mustache.  OMG!!! lol.

Anywho, i saw people that i had missed greatly: Jimbo, Allie, Catie...wow...i dunno how to feel about anything now.  It's nuts.  At least we're talking again.  That's a step in the right direction.  

Cleo was hitting on me, i think.  That was creepy.  I stuck my tongue out at her and she's like ""that was strangely arousing.  I'm now gonna dream about Ben and his tongue..."" and she felt like telling everyone about the whole thing....ohh....my...::whew::

"event","OOooo, the question always is when you return from a trip:  Are you a changed person?  The answer: Yes!  Name it, i did it while in california...except sex.  I'm still a virgin.  :-(...Poopy.  

I went shopping, bought (yes, the man who has almost 5000 songs on his computer BOUGHT) not 1, but TWO cds (Skinny Puppy's Greatest Hits, and PM5K - Transform).  My bro also burned me 10 (give or take) cds.  Including both APC albums, the new My Chemical Romance Album, Thicke, The Underworld Soundtrack, some Vandals, Choking Victim, etc etc, as well as a self-proclaimed Punk Cabaret band from Boston known as the Dresden Dolls (just two people, keyboard/vocals and drums/backing vocals).  They have this one song, which opens up their album called: ""Good Day""  and its about a person talking to their ex.  And the narrator had a WONDERFUL day and all the ex wants to talk about is how shitty their day has been, blah blah blah.  I'm sure we've all been through this before.  Here are the lyrics:

Good Day - by the: Dresden Dolls

so you dont want to hear about my good song?
and you dont want to hear about how i am getting on
with all the things that i can get done
the sun is in the sky & i am by my lonesome
so you don't want to hear about my good day?
you have better things to do than to hear me say

god its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i took out the trash today and i'm on fire...

so you don't want to hear about my good friends?
you dont have the guts to take the truth or consequence
success is in the eye of the beholder
and its looking even better over your cold shoulder

i'm not suggesting you up and line me up for questioning
but jesus think about the bridges you are burning
and i'm betting
that even though you knew it from the start
you'd rather be a bitch than be an ordinary broken heart

so go ahead and talk about your bad day...
i want all the details of the pain and misery
that you are inflicting on the others
i consider them my sisters and i'd like their numbers

god its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i took up croquet today and i'm on fire

i picked up the pieces of my broken ego
i have finally made my peace as far as you and me go
but i'd love to have you up to see the place
& i'd like to do more than survive i'd like to rub it in your face.....

hey! its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i had so much fun today and i'm on fire
god it's been a lovely day everything's been going my way
ever since you went away hey i'm on fire.....
i'm on fire...
i'm on fire...
so you dont want to hear about my good day?
------------------------------------
I especially love, this stanza:

i picked up the pieces of my broken ego
i have finally made my peace as far as you and me go
but i'd love to have you up to see the place
& i'd like to do more than survive i'd like to rub it in your face.....

Thats totally how i've been feeling lately.

While i was there also got an APC tshirt, an Avenged Sevenfold tshirt and a pair of goth pinstripe pants with chains.  When i got home i invested in some black nail polish and stole my mom's black eyeliner.  :-D...cant wait for the first day of school.  We start tomorrow (tuesday), and i'm psyched.  Lotsa people i wanna see again."

Then i went to work and an SAT prep and when i arrived home again, my dad had left me the much-needed new keyboard...while installed that one onto this computer i took some rubbing alcohol and q-tips and cleaned off my other keyboard...it looks perdy now.

That was my day in a nutshell.  I am writing a new song called Diese Himmel Schwarze (These Black Heavens, in German)  I'm starting to really get into the german language...the songs wont be in german, only the titles, and i have a bunch more titles to work with."

Let's start from the show on the 14th...It was awesome we didour entire set of 13 songs and redid one as oi punk and also threw in Secret Agent Man for the hell of it.  There were 30 people at the show.  And we made 30 bucks on stickers alone, not including the 10+ for tee-shirts.

Since Wednesday: I was at a songwriting workshop at the Berklee college of music in Boston.  How cool is this?:  getting less than six hours a night cause you're jamming with other musicians from 7 pm to 1 or 2 am.  I met Kim, who's awesome, and Steve(O) who helped me write a song which we performed at an Open Mic show on friday, to very good response.  It was just this weekend that my vibrato kicked in full force.  It was...phenominal to say the LEAST.  I even made some music business contacts :-) as well as a bunch of other friends.

That's been the exciting parts of my half-month since i last wrote.  On the 30th i'll be heading to Venture CA to visit my bro till the 5th."

"event","Well, things are getting sorted out.  Maybe not for the better, but maybe ""sorted out"" is inherently better.  I dunno.  I just mean, not necessarily my way...but wake the fuck up, Ben, stop being a goddamn drama queen.  Not everything goes your way.  And i realized that, today.  So i don't feel too bad about everything.

Good news: 1.) I pulled out my old Phantom Planet is Missing CD...god i love taht thing.
2.) I got my Presidents of the USA CD back from Tom and have been listening to Peaches all day.  ""millions of peaches, peaches for me.  Millions of peaches, peaches for free.""  My band might do that song.  Hope so. >>heeeeeeee---insert too-wide, dorky smile here<<"

"event","My day sucked.  First i didn't go to work cause i woke up with a nasty headache/stomach combo.  Then Allie, this girl i had an uber crush on and i get into ahuge argument.  I compliment her saying she has a lot in common with an ex of mine, someone who even today, i would die for.  She takes this as an offense, cause she's not used to being complimented and starts bawling.  She sends her friend Jenn to nip at my ankles, telling me i don't care and i never cared and i'll i set out to do was make her cry.

This is what i said to Allie's Friend:
I'm suicidal, i'm depressed, because i've had three girlfriends all have made me feel less than i am.  I was raped at the age of 6 by my babysitter.  Now, why am i telling you this? because i want to.  
	This is why i want to be with someone, so i can confide in them, so i can tell them everything, so they can hold me and tell me its gonna be okay, even if they KNOW it wont.  
I wanna be able to say to my best bud, ""Hey man, you see that amazing blonde over there?  That's my girl. ya the one with the soft eyes that are telling me they can't wait for me to hug her and hold her and kiss her and tell her i love her"" thats what i want.  
I try complimenting.  I try waiting.  I try seeing her, but she's gotten herself in trouble or she's doing other things to occupy her time.   Yet she still says that it's all my fault.  I have lost count of how many times i've invited her to hang with me.  She's either to busy with family or friends, or she got arrested.  And she wonders why we dont know each other well.  
If I had things my way, I would have seen her every weekend this summer.  I have seen her once this summer for about an hour.  And that sucks,  especially when she's all you can think about, cause you get it in your head that something big is gonna happen between you two, and you keep waiting, and waiting and waiting, and it never comes. 
Then you start to lose faith, and you start making up illusions like love  and togetherness,  in vain hopes that she'll believe they're true.  But then, even those start to fade, and you eventually feel nothing, all because you were put on hold and you're starting to get sick of the elevator music that plays in the background while you wait for an operator to finally pick up

P.S i did a 441,902 point combo in Tony Hawk 4"

"event","So my band has a full setlist for the show on Saturday (the 14th).  We have 13 songs, about an hour, of music, and two more rehearsals to get about 5 perfected.  I'm so psyched.

We have 7 covers, including VAST, Blur, Greenday, Green Jelly and Nirvana...and six originals (all lyrics written by me, all music written by the band as a whole).  So thirteen songs :-D...its gonna be so rad.  I'm finally in a band that's doing well...

It's almost traumatizing.  LOL."

"event","So its the 4th of August...I haven't written in this thing in...how long?  Looong time.  I started a xanga but none of my friends use it so i feel like reverting back to this.

So much has gone on.  Crushes have come and gone.  Old relationships starting to rekindle, and then, along with the person, they disappear.  I haven't talked to catie for 2 weeks now.

On a happier note, i have a band DNA Level C, we've done one show which was rocking for a first show, and now we're on to our second, which is being performed at my house on the 14th of this month.  I can't wait.  We play hard rock/punk/metal.  check out our lowsy, soon-to-be-updated website.  www.freewebs.com/dnalevelc

Work is long and boring, though own of my fellow instructors, Scott, and I, are making up our own martial art.  We mix Shaolin (the Chinese Monk style) and Jeet Kune Do (invented by Bruce Lee).  Together the forms are fluid, graceful and extremely deadly.

Been playing lotsa video games, picked up my magic cards again, continue working out, and, as perusual, i'm contemplating life.  I'm just not sure about anything anymore, but isnt that always the case?  >>Sigh<<.

Later"

"event","Wow, i haven't written in so long.  I have so much to write about i dont know where to begin.  I have an idea for a band i wanna do.  I can only describe it as hard rock mixed with ScrEmo, Hardcore and Black Metal.  My band will be called Whispering Sweet Nothings, and i already have two songs written.

I've been really down on myself and depressed lately.  Can't seem to do anything right for anybody.  I hope I over it soon

I read ""Blankets"" by Craig Thompson.  It his ""autobiography""  done as a comic.  It's the most amazing novel/comic ever.  Best thing i've ever read; so moving, so much pretained to my life.  I've been crying on and off since i finished reading it at 6:30.  It's amazing, order it at www.topshelfcomix.com

Okay, i'm gone."

"event","Monday...yesterday.  O, god.  That day RULED.  And my voice is shot now.  I sang 11 songs on monday.  The Rock/Pop Ensemble sang 5 songs during assembly.  The school loved us.  Then my friend Jimbo and I did three tunes for the battle of the bands (winning best cover for Billy Joel's ""And So it Goes"").  Then after the battle, the rock/pop ensemble got up and did 3 songs as a reprise, while the judges put in their votes.  O man, it was great.  It wailed. I love music, i love performing.  It's such a rush!"

"event","My life is crumbling around me.  I'm right back where i was 2 yrs ago.  No band, no girlfriend, no love, i'm so depressed, suicidal, and praying to God, all to no avail.  I'm afraid, because i dont know where i'm going to go from here.  And i do love her.  And it's hard, you must all know what i'm talking about.  And i'm trying.  I'm just so...scared.

And i can't stop crying.

"event","How does that sound for a metal band? Penitenziagite.  I was gonna make a funk metal band, but i dunno now.  I've always had a thing for loud, symphonic, melodic, sometimes mellow and acoustic metal.  Liek Opeth, Porcupine Tree, Rhapsody, Domine, Dream Theater, Soilwork, Children of Bodom, Cradle of Filth, Arena, Redemption, Iced Earth etc etc etc.  And since i'm not sure what's going on between myself and Catie, and Harrison is pretty sure he's not going to join the band, then i think i'll find my own way, or something.

So.  Penitenziagite (Pen-it-en-zee-aj-ih-tay).  A middle-ages term used as a battlecry for heretics.  It is some bastardized dialect of Latin and means ""Jesus has come to earth and we must do penance"".  Sounds cool, huh?  Anyway, comment, tell me if you like it or not, and gimme some good suggestions.  I started writing a song called Gift of Death.  I'm really into.  People seem to think its my best work thus far.  Only about 3:15 in though.  Not near completion in the slightest..."

My band's not gonna be able to pull together the song for the battle of the bands, which kinda blows.  But jamie and i will do two songs acoustically, so that'll be pretty cool.  Probably gonna do Over by the Boondock Saints and Space Lord by Monster Magnet.  Ya, it'll be sha-weet."

"event","Nothing's the same anymore.  I'm going through incredible change.  Times aren't the same anymore.  Times were so much better THEN, whenever THEN was.  I still look back and remember things and think to myself ""shit, that was amazing.  I had it made, and i'll never ever be able to reproduce these times ever again.""  I can't listen to one of my favorite songs anymore without being brought to tears.

I still remember the time i first performed for her.  At school.  I remember the times we lay in bed together and were happy.  I remember seeing her smile and saying ""I like your smile.""  She asks why.  I answer ""It's the smile of someone who's in love.""  Now it's call gone

So i say fuck it.  If life changes, so will I.  I stopped listening to the music i used to.  Now i'm into loud, dark and brooding.

I thought it was going to last forever.  But i was wrong.  Nothing lasts forever.
I promised myself i'd never get back with her though.  And i won't.  You can't just see that i'm not over her, quite yet."

I do it for the drugs
I do it just to feel alive
I do it for the love
That I get from the bottom
Of a bottle

We got, like, a five minute time slot and we'll be doing Judith by APC ::drool::.  Can't fuckin wait.  We had our first practice and Catie's almost got the guitar down.  Jamie already knows the bass (though he's actually a guitarst).  I thought i had a bassist, but she doesn't really seem interested...And Joe just hears it once and has got it.  He's the man.  So ya, that's where we are.  It's gonna be TT HOTT."

Oh yeah, Magic City comics!  I've updated the rest of ""Dirty"" so you have a complete story to read:  <a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com/dirty11.html"">Page 11</a>, <a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com/dirty12.html"">Page 12</a>, <a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com/dirty13.html"">Page 13</a>, and <a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com/dirty14.html"">Page 14</a>.  This story went through several artists before Anna Clinch, uh, clinched it.  She's an awesome young lady, and maybe we'll work on something again someday.  (That's not a cryptic hint or anything.  I'm just speculating here.)  Anyway, I'm going out of town for a week or so, and I won't be updating for another couple weeks.  So come back in August for new comics!

Oh, and I've started updating Magic City again!  Geez, another long, long drought.  I'm sorry about that.  It's just really difficult sometimes to get things lined up with artists.  They have their own schedules and lives, and things just happen.  So, we got new comics for a while, and hopefully, we can update every week until the final comic (yes, it's happening) is completed.  Hopefully.  No promises.  But hey, if you've stuck with me this long, then you're awesome and, sadly, used to these waits.

First new page is the story ""Dirty"" featuring art by Anna Clinch, an artist I met on Twitter who I said ""HI WANNA DO COMICS?!?!??!"" and she eventually said yes.  NOTE:  This method will not work for everyone.  Anyway, this story went through a few different artists before Anna worked on it, and she did a great job.  And this is my first lettering job I've done, too, so yay for me!  Hope you enjoy this weird, weird love story.

Why did I start a new blog, and why did I name it the same as this?  Well, I'm terribly unoriginal with names, apparently, and I wanted a fresh start.  Without repeating too much of what I said in my new blog, basically it's a fresh start for longer, more insightful rantings.  Mostly I'm going to talk about comics, making comics, writing comics, comics I like and whatnot, along with other posts about other things.  (Hint:  Underworld post on Friday.)

There's nothing really wrong with this blog, but LiveJournal is kinda dead, and mine is bogged down with personal stuff and Magic City updates.  I'll still post here from time to time.  I may even cross over entries.  But the Blogspot blog will, hopefully, contain better writing than what I do here.  (I am writing my posts ahead of time for this.)  We'll see.

Feel free to stop by and check it out.  I plan on updating on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays with something (to try and keep me writing on a schedule).  See ya there!"

When you don't pay artists, getting them to do anything is like trying to herd cats.  With amnesia.  This is one of the primary reasons I'm going to end Magic City.  I've been lucky to work with the artists I have, but most of them are distracted by more pressing things than my silly scripts, so I do understand that.  But, without naming names, some are only doing this as a hobby.

I've been thinking of writing something about my experiences someday.  That may be sooner rather than later."

Okay, so my good friend Rachel Dukes, who I met at <a href=""http://gregthelen.livejournal.com/154368.html"">ECCC</a> and also did a rocking job on <a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com/gb1.html"">The Genie Bar</a> for me, is having some tax troubles.  She runs her own business, <a href=""http://www.poseurink.com"">Poseur Ink</a>, and well, the taxes...they trouble her.  Some kind of taxes and things didn't go her way.  So I suggest you all go and buy some of her <a href=""http://shop.poseurink.com/collections/poseur-ink"">merchandise</a>.  I picked up this at ECCC:

It features art from a ton of great artists:  Brandon Graham (<i>King City</i> and the guy who got me back to my cousin's after ECCC), Ryan Kelly (<i>Local</i>), Jim Mahfood (<i>Clerks, Grrl Scouts</i>) and so so many more!  I know a lot of you

<font size=""+5"">music nerds</font>

are out there, and this is an anthology of <b>great art</b> all about how music affects us, influences us, and so on.  I have a copy, and it's <i>awesome</i>.  So you audiophiles out there, and I know there are a lot of you on LJ, get this now!  There's also a Side A, which is the prequel (or something), and I'm planning on getting that.

Hey hai, <a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com/zmon2.html"">page 2</a> of ""Zimmermon"" is now posted (a little early for MST, but it's Wednesday in most of the world, right?).  The plot starts to thicken as this one guy starts to get all leery-eyed.  See ya next week, folks!"

<a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com/zmon1.html"">Page 1</a> of ""Zimmermon"" is now posted, and we're back to stories that take longer than three pages to tell.  ""Zimmermon"" is actually going to be the longest Magic City to run to date (which may or may not be exceeded by another story at some point in the future), and I'm okay with that.  I like stories that take time to build.  Of course, you won't see the end of this one by summer, so, yeah.  Sit tight, folks.

Oh, and not only does this story feature the return of Jose Sanchez to Magic City, it also features our tribute to Akira Kurosawa's amazing film, Rashomon.  I remember seeing the movie back in an English class in high school as my teacher was trying to culture up us rowdy Montana kids.  At first, I thought it was okay, but I was young and dumb back then (and so far, only one of those has really changed).  Now, I see the brilliance of it, and I'm going to come out and say this in no way comes close to Rashomon.  It'll be very good, maybe even great, but dudes, I can't touch Kurosawa.  On my best day, I'd be his golf caddy.

Or something...  See?  I'd bet Kurosawa could've come up with a better analogy and made a film about it that would stand the test of time as a classic."

Alright, so I am finally home from Emerald City ComiCon 2010!  It was a blast, but it tired the hell out of me.  I'll try to go in chronological order as much as I can remember what happened in what order.  And so I don't completely invade your friends page, click on the link!  Here's a pic of something I got to entice you to read through!

Alright, so the first day was KARAZY!  Way more people than I thought were there, mostly to see Leonard Nimoy and Stan Lee, but that was good to see a great attendance.  Of course, it made walking around a chore.  I brought a ton of stuff with me, so I chose day one to just browse and get as much stuff signed as possible.  Also, whenever I saw someone dressed up, I stopped to take a photo.  Some really great costumes were there!

After the con, I found Rachel <lj user=""poisonrational""> Dukes and some of her friends and friends of friends that neither of us knew but eventually became our friends as well.  Among those friends was <a href=""http://royalboiler.deviantart.com/"">Brandon Graham</a> of <i>King City</i> fame.  Well, I don't know if ""fame"" is the right word, but he was at the Image table, so that's a pretty good gig.  I remember <lj user=""nem0""> was trying to get his book a few years ago, and that it got some pretty good reviews (I think).  Anyway, I knew about it, and it was great to meet and hang out with Brandon.  He grew up in Seattle so he knew how to get to places.  A cool, nice, mellow guy.

I also met a couple of awesome artists:  Natalie Nourigat and Emi Lenox.  They were friends of friends that tagged along with Rachel, Brandon, and me as we went to grab a bite to eat at a baguette sandwich shop.  I eventually discovered that they were both artists and had a table at the con, and you should most definitely check out their work!  Natalie's, a.k.a. Tally, site is called <a href=""http://www.randomproduction.com"">Random Production</a>, and you can get the links to all her stuff including her journal comic.  Her art is fantastic, and um, she's beautiful, and I totally have a crush on her.  And Emi is just one yarn ball of cuteness!  Her site is called <a href=""http://www.emitown.blogspot.com/"">EmiTown</a>.  It will never fail to put a smile on your face.

Natalie and Emi...if you can see them

So after the baguette place, we went to a pub in an alley near Pike's Place (the alley has a name and has a lot of bars and restaurants and stuff, so it's well known in Seattle).  We met some other comic book people who I never really got to know.  But afterwards, Brandon helped me and Rachel get back to where we needed to be.  We walked with Rachel to her hotel, and Brandon made sure I got to the right bus--even going so far as to ride with me for a while.  This was above and beyond cool!  And I promptly bought one of everything he was selling at the con the next day.  When I saw him on Sunday, he asked me if I got home alright, and I thanked him a few more times for making sure I got on the right bus.  So now I expect everyone to buy <i>King City</i>!  Brandon Graham = awesome!

Okay, onto the second day.  It was much more chill on Sunday.  Fewer people initially, and I got the chance to leisurely walk around without bumping into too many people.  I even got the chance to meet Kate <lj user=""beatonna""> Beaton, get a sketch, and a fat pony figurine.  If you ever see the number of comments on any one of her LJ posts, that was the number of people waiting in line on Saturday.  She was a little late getting in on Sunday, so I was able to get near the front for her.  And when she showed up, so did five billion people behind me (plus or minus a few billion).

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2690/4441634861_4b10257956_o.jpg"">

Then I went around handing out my Magic City presentations to publishers.  First stop was the Oni Press booth, and being a little nervous and unsure of how to approach them, I browsed their books for a bit.  Then a guy asked the man behind the tables if he could drop off a business card for them.  He said sure, and I chimed in saying I had something to leave behind to.  I handed him my presentation, and he was nice when he took it.  Now, having some confidence, I went around to almost all of the publishers (discounting DC because they're for more established people), handing out six presentations in all.  I have no idea if anyone will read my comics let alone email me, but who knows!

And now to some things I bought.  The first thing is the fat pony from Kate Beaton's <a href=""http://www.harkavagrant.com"">Hark, A Vagrant!</a>, followed by the shot glasses from Meredith Gran's <a href=""http://www.octopuspie.com"">Octopus Pie</a>.

I didn't want to tear them out of the sketchbook and scan them in, at least not yet.  I may frame a few of them, but anyway, I just took photos, so the quality isn't the best.

Anyway, I had a great time at ECCC!  I was exhausted (and still am), and I'm definitely going to make another go around next year (and it'll be three days instead of two).  Met some great new people all around and got to hang out with Rachel, who turned out to be awesome!  Who knows, maybe I'll have something to show people in a year (or two) and can get a table.  My legs were killing me.

(Well, technically, it's this weekend, and I'm taking two days to drive to Seattle.)

So we'll see how that goes.

Oh, and I'll be meeting up with ""The Genie Bar"" artist, Rachel <lj user=""poisonrational""> Dukes, the first artist I've worked with that I will have met in person!  She's setting up a table for her <a href=""http://www.poseurink.com/"">Poseur Ink</a> company, which publishes comics and makes t-shirts and buttons and things.  Anyone reading this and attending (so far, just me that I know of) should definitely stop by her table and buy fifty of everything.  And if you're not, then go to her site and buy fifty of everything.

So I'm coming back next Wednesday, and the next update will likely be a day late.  See ya next week!"

"event","The <a href=""http://www.magiccitycomic.com"">final page</a> of ""Sacrifice Cliff"" is posted, and after Hushicho's story, this is easily my favorite.  When I saw Giorgio's art, I knew he was perfect for this tale, and he far exceeded my expectations.  Now, for the non-Billingsian, you're probably wondering what this Sacrifice Cliff is.

This is Sacrifice Cliff, and trust me, it's bigger than this photo indicates.  It's just to the south of Billings, and it's easy to notice coming down from the Heights or westward on I-90.  While the rims are just a random series of indistinct cliffs, Sacrifice Cliff is pretty distinctive.  For years, I never knew the source of it's name.  Turns out there are a couple variations on the story.  One is the story you've just been reading.  A group of Crow Indian warriors returned from battle to see their village ravaged by small pox.  Seen as an act from the One Who Had Made Everything's disapproval, they sacrificed themselves to pay for whatever sins they committed.  The other variation is of a young couple who were out on a joy ride instead of a group of warriors.  While researching this story, I relied heavily on <a href=""http://www.charlierussell.org/sacrificecliff.html"">this wonderful poem by Bette Wolf Duncan</a>.

As for the ending, that was a little poetic license on my part.  I'm not overly familiar with Crow folklore and beliefs, but I thought watching them all go splat would be in extremely poor taste.

And in other news, I've been getting tons of hits from <a href=""http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/www.magiccitycomic.com/"">this one line review on stumbleupon.com</a>!  Seriously, the past three days alone, I've received more than 100 hits each day, almost completely due to stumbleupon.com.  I have no idea how they found my webcomic, but I'm should send them a fruit basket or something."

"event","Holy shit, Anthony Bourdain came to Montana for <a href=""http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_9591abf2-8ed0-11de-a8b6-001cc4c002e0.html"">the Monday episode of No Reservations!</a>  He's sort of a rock star chef that travels the globe eating and writing (how can I get this job?) and occasionally takes in the local customs and activities of wherever he is.  So what do you do when you come to Montana (apparently)?  You fish, of course.

Er, okay.  Personally, I've never fished, but I'm an unusual Montanan.  It looks like from <a href=""http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Anthony_Bourdain/Anthony_Bourdains_Photo_Journals_Main?idLink=b96e37e6562de110VgnVCM100000698b3a0a____"">the site</a> they stayed in the Livingston/south central part of the state, which is too bad.  I mean, what about the Flathead/Glacier area?  Well, I guess I shouldn't speak too soon without watching the episode.

Still, awesome."

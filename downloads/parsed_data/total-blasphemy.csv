Im tired of having people tell me how ""useless"", how much of an ""asshole"", ""pathetic"", ""incondsiderate"", and ""selfish"" i am. The desicions i make effect me as well. To those of you who read this and think ""oh he's talking directly to me"". You're wrong. This goes for everyone who likes to bitch to me about... well... me.

It's all life,
and sometimes,
you've got to swim with your eyes open,
even when it burns.

laying here in the grass next to this
I feel such anger and loss
but how could that have been when you were never there?
where did this feeling of loss come from?
the tide has brought me to this end
and you will have washed away like the beach sands
on a long summer night

Sometimes you've got to swim,
when the tide is coming in,
because it's the only way to reach the other side.

I've been caught in this down current,
aching for days,
and I came into this place,
knowing full well I may drown,
so drag if you must,
you won't pull me down,
and if I die trying,
at least I'll have swam,
and can you say the same for yourself?


Sometimes you need to drown,
because the tide is to strong,
And the wave have over taken you to down.
And the rocks at the bottom are to jagged to take footing.
So it slices away as the salt enters the leasion..

Your water runs over me,
and at last I can breath,
caught up in your drowning so sweet,
to feel you in my lungs,
you're all I want to breath,
I was born to this world,
and I can take this. 


 It's all life... runs away like water... 
and sometimes you got to swim with your eyes open 
even when it burns...


Dark waters filled with reds and deep blues
Alter your frame of mind and you turn away
Diluted and obscure water flows over everything i see
changing from red to yellow then back to blue
has the current taken you away from here?


waterfall.

-fin


As much as i dont want to exist. As much as i feel like making all of it go away. I still have people who care about me. I still have people who love me. I know im probably never going to be with her again. But at the same time. I dont want a relationship with anyone other than her. I've grown to realize that sometimes some people dont deserve good luck. Some people have used up thier time of praise and happiness. I had that time. For about 5 months. And the amount of happiness i felt within that 5 months was enough for a whole lifetime. I've used mine up. And im prepared to live my life. Waiting. For something greater to come along. Something impossible. Because sometimes you've got to swim with your eyes open. Even when it burns like fucking hell. Right?"

"event","There are some things worse then death... I've felt that way for the past week or 2. The only reason i felt like staying alive is because i have a responsibility to my family, friends, and nicole. Suicide is weak. Selfish, and weak. I cannot be a martyr yet. because i have no worthy cause to die for. I'm usually the kind of person that will fuck himself over more then nessicary to prove a point. In this case i considered suicide and realized that i am only proving one point. Weakness. A sign that everyone who has fucked me over. or is out to fuck me over has won. My point will be proven. I love nicole with everything i have. I will not let go of what we had, have and will have in the future. I wont forget. I wont let them win. I will wait until i am breathing my last breath of air to be with her. And until then. I will and am forever taken. Im tired of people telling me to move on. That it will never happen. Those people are just as weak minded and ignorant as those who commit selfish acts such as suicide. Im no saint. I dont know all there is to know about love and the like. But i know one thing. I AM in love with this girl and i will be in love with her as long as im alive. If she decides one day to no longer want to deal with what is going on, and to move on to other people or whatever. I will still support her fully. I will be there when she needs me to. I will support whatever decision she makes. Even if that decision is to never be with me again. Because, my friends.... that is true love. Ive said this before. and i mean it just as much as i did when i said it the first time, second, third, and everytime thereafter. I want only for her to be happy. and forever be happy. I will bleed for her. I will fight for her. I will kill myself for her. Actions will speak louder then words. But right now all i have is my word. And i pray to whatever the fuck is up there that if she is to read this, she will believe every word being typed out. she will take it in. and know. I will always be here for her. Until i die. because that is how <b><u>i</b></u> love. This, i want her to know. Even if its after she makes a desicion. Because this is how i truly feel. When i said i would love you no matter what. Forever. I meant it."

These times will not be with me. As much as i want it to happen. As much as i need it to happen. She will probably not be with me again. Not being with me is probably healthy for her. Being healthy will make her happy. And in the end thats what it comes down to. Will the girl i love. The girl i value more then my own life. My own two hands. My own soul. Be happy? In the end. It is all i truely want. I have said this to her. I have meant it everytime i said it. I love her. I will never love anyone as much as i have loved her. As much as i love her now.

"event","Had an awesome show last night. We got cut short because all our songs are like.... 7 minutes long. A lot of people were there. People we're beating the hell out of each other. Emo girls were swooning over me. It was an all around good show.
My mom called Nicole's house last afternoon at like 2. She looked thier # up in a phone book or something. I dunno what she said. But she left a message on thier machine. I doubt they'll have the decency to at least call <b>my mom</b> back. Whatever. This is ridiculous. It's comming close to our 6 month... I wonder if she'll think about me as much as i think about her. I doubt it. I bet shes real busy getting better. Thats good though. If thinking about me doesnt help her. I dont want her to. I just want her to be happy and healthy. I cant let my selfishness interrupt that. I miss her and i love her so fucking much.

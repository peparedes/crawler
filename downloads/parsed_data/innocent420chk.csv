"event","Happy New Year everyone!!! As per tradition, my new years wasn't that great, wasn't horrible, but it could have been a billion times better. I went to Gus's girlfriend's house, Tori, with Steve, Zaal, and one of Zaal's friends. It was pretty uneventful seeing how hey limited my drinking, the noise, and even made me get off the phone with Al at 3 because people were tired. I was like well ca I just go outside or in a room or anything because I didn't want to be rude, but no. I had to go to sleep, because it was apparently bedtime for Rachel.

Anyways, I feel as if my entire Winter Break has been wasted, tomarrow (today) is the last day, and I have to work. I worked nearly everyday, excluding Christmas, Tuesday, and today. I also haven't done any of my homework and it's just like gonna be so stressful tomarrow. So I best be getting some sleep, seeing as I have a 7 1/2 hour shift to look forward to."

"event","okay so i have been working like a mutha lately. Like no time off. However, this paycheck should be mad cash. school's starting on tuesday and i'm worried because i lack a job (i'm co-opping) and have yet to finish my summer reading, much less started the actual essay which has to be 3 pages. However, I DO get off work at 3 tomarrow and dont have to work monday, the day the pool closes! so ha!

Other than work, kelly and i have been getting into a lot of fights lately. she's like i dont like being yelled at, however what she doesnt seem to understand is that ditching me is like straight up being like i hate you rachel to me. plus im fucking tired of her always having to get her way, she acts like shes a princess or some shit. anyway, ever since she started going out with josh again they've both been fucking assholes to me. and sometimes it seems to me it doesnt matter to her if we have plans, but if someone else is willing to drive her ass around and like pay for her to do shit she doesnt give me a second thought. its like whatever, i have someone to use!

okay time to shower and read the most depressing book ever (Angela's Ashes) byeeee"

"event","omg so I just found out what happened to this sophmore luke tiahart and it's so depressing. He like killed himself two days ago, my bro and everyone is so down about it. Yeah, I didn't know him or like anything, or I saw him sometimes in the hall, but I don't think I ever spoke to him.

But yeah, like ashley's staying with me, I dunno until when. We saw Kelly yesterday,and stayed at her house like forever. She's still grounded, and will be until 311, in 5 days!"

"event","Okay I know I JUST complained about people talking about hook ups but this is different.

Three nights ago I went to this party with Josh, his ex, Marissa and some of Josh's friends. Like omg we drank so much, everyone was hooking up like crazy. I made out for like 10 minutes with Kelly, and had a threeway make out thing with Marisa and this guy. Omg it was crazy fun, except there was a guy there, like Bobbby, and I was the only one he was with (which is like a surpise you know cuz everyone with was everyone) and i didn't remember and he seemed like all sad!

I wanna see what hes doing today though I spoke to him last night. Marisa was over and we were trashed, surprise surprise.
 
Oh yeah, fuck mansuy and kyle."

"event","I haven't written in like forever and since I totally can't sleep, might as well now.

The cruise was lots of fun, it went by way too fast. In Costa Maya, I met some people my own age and chilled at the beach with them.  They have the most gorgeous water there, it's like sparkling and clear. In Belize, my mom bought me this necklace and bracelet, they're matching pink leather and pearls. In Cozmell (sp?) here wasn' tmuch to do because I didnt actually go into the city, only the port, but I got a thing of tequilla and rum, since there is no drinking age. I was able to smuggle the tequilla on board, but had to check the rum because you aren't allowed to bring liquor on the ship. At the last stop, I went with my dad into town and while we were walking this mexican guy says ""hello mister whisker"" to my dad. It was soooo randomly funny.

I met a lot of cool people, but like I don't see myself keeping in touch with them that much, except like maybe one or two even though I got their sns and all. On board there was this crazy guy who was gay that like gave us alcohol and got everyone so sick and he almost went off with one of my guy friends, but I stopped them.

Since I got back, I got my car taken away because of drinking and driving (caught by the parents) The 4th was lots of fun, got drunk with marisa and lit fireworks, then continued to be drunk with tara when she slept over. 

But yeah, my parents want to enter me into like AA, they don't seem to understand that like during the summer i WILL drink, and they can't stop that. I didn't do it too much during the year, but it's SUMMER. And I'm getting tired of this whole no car deal, I'll have to steal it bak when no one is home since I found all the keys I needed.

Anyways, I have to be up super early tomarrow, which sucks seeing as today I slept until 3:30. And I also noticed I was really like bruised from something last night its huge and on my outter thigh. Hm oh well. So yeha, I'll try to update more but thats all for now."

"event","The surgery sucked, my leg still hurts.  Being recertified for CPR was really hard because I can't bend my leg that easy, and then to put soooo much weight on it like to be on my knees like was extremely painful. But I really need to find a new place to work this summer, since I am not going back to Truro. Seems there's a lot to do in a short amount of time, none of it things I actually want to do.

Okay, I just want to say something that's annoying me. These freaking girls, who think that they are being cool by bragging about hooking up with guys, or saying that guys like them, when actually they probably don't, they just are just being nice to them. You don't sound cool, you sound pathetic.

Anyway I'm off to sleep, or try at least."

"event","The surgery hurt. A lot. And I really love Helen for being there for me, she came and visited me on Mondey and gave me a balloon and hung out with me. Sadly enough, I had a reaction to something they used so it's all red and itchy. I learned the people who just dont care about me are though:

Jessie: Who would rather gossip online than see how I am, and makes me cry like nearly anytime I have to interact out of school with her because she treats me like I'm like shit.
Alex: Just was like hey, bye, when I imed him on Monday, the first time I was able to move.
Steve (CNU): He said some really mean things to me last night, too mean for me to even list here.

Other than surgery news, I still have to buy Hell her 18th birthday gift! No clue what though. And I have to get that bitch Jessie something too, only because I won't stoop to her level.

Oh yeah. Thanks Clare for calling me."

"event","Surgery tomarrow. I pretty nervous about it, seeing as it's actually two in one, so I don't have to go in twice. I'm going to have the rod and screws in my leg removed, and the plates in my arm. Lucky for me, my parents seem to care how obviously concerned I am, only not really. In fact my dad actually had the nerve to compare this surgery to others. Um, excuse me? Like just because you've experienced something that's painful before, doesn't mean that another, though less serious, still doesn't hurt you and make you nervous.

Other than that, I don't know what's up with Whitney. Like I think she lied to me last night, because when I was on the phone with her I said ""are you going to Lifetime?"" just asking because she was talkig about it. I dont even have a membership, and she said no she was going home from dance. Immediately after that, I could have sworn I heard Steve's voice and she like said bye pretty quick and hung up. But like I might have misheard.

And then today, I was like are we gonna go to tanfit, because she was like do you wanna go yesterday, talking about today. I basically didnt care, but said sure, and asked like around 330 today after she hadnt brought it up and said she couldnt because she had a project to do and steve got off at 6. And she had something to do at 6. Making it seem like an obligation like to her parents, though she didnt actually say that. Anyway, I call Steve, just to see if he wants to chill and he's like I'm hanging out with Whitney after work you can too. I was like she said she was busy at 6, but maybe she meant you. and he called her and me back and said yeah.

I mean, its like she doesnt want me to know she's with Steve? Her bf? The guy who introduced me to her?"

"event","The fashion show is totally only two days away. I'm so nervous about it, like half of me kind of wishes it was cancelled, just because I have been known to choke when push comes to shove. But that's more of like interviews, I haven't done anything like this in a while. Still, I don't who, and if I will have a partner, because Chrissy is being kind of annoying and all, but it's not something to freak out over.

Oh and when it comes to guys, I had it right to stay away from them. Anytime I'm with one, I always just end up regretting it."

"event","Ow, I'm soooo sore. I don't even know why, it's probably because I've just gotton in the habit of coming home and sleeping for like an hour or so and then doing something, unlike today and yesterday.

Tuesday I went to the mall with Whitney and bought a black tank top that says ""BAM"" in pinkish purple, and we got pretty lacey stuff over at vickie's.

And today we went to Tanfit. Unfortunately, there was a long line, and paying customers come first. I also had to get my haircut, so I left, did that, then came back and tanned. 

Okay I'd like to make this very clear to everone how TERRIFIED I am about these cicadas coming. OMG I do not know what I am going to do. Like really, I can't deal with them. Everyone says how they're already seeing them, luckily I haven't but yesterday Abby had one fall on her head, and I'm like in a TOTAL panic."

"event","Okay, like I am getting seriously concerned now with my US/VA History SOLs. My teacher seriously sucks. We're like 2 weeks away and we're still on WWII? He's so lazy, everyday (7th period) he promises to finish, and then doesn't, it's like I don't know anything about the 70s and all that, we've been studying the Revolutionary through WWII since kindergarden basically. I can't beleive he wasted all this time.

Anyways, that was my little rant. What's his name, Jaimie's guy's friend called me last night, I really hate it when people talk ghetto, it's so annoying and unattractive, not to mention insulting. I have a name, and it's not girl. But for now I think I'm gonna go tan, I better do that before all those horrible swarms of bugs come."

"event","First post in a while, so here goes nothing i suppose.
Back in St jose as of last friday, and ive been doing absolutly nothing all week. Just my way of unwinding i suppose.
Nothing really new here, bill is still no where to be found on the weekend, and everyone else just gets along the way they get along. As for me i have been tring to find a place of residence in the southern STL area, as i accepted a internship offer at a foundry in pevely, mo. Mom is kinda freaked out about it and is despiratly tring to get me to stay home this summer, but wont ever openly admit it. But it looks like Junior is going to be working at chrysler this summer, so i talked to him and we are going to look for a place to live sometime monday afternoon. I will already be in stl at that point because i have to get a physical and drug test before i can actually start working. I also have to track down some boot store in stl to buy my work boots from, as they have to be a special kind of steel toed boot. And they are going to pay be 16 bucks an hour to do extremely simple work, like use a stop watch to measure pour times on castings, and use calipers to measure castings and then use excel to determine standard deviation and tolerances etc etc. 10 weeks of that and then i will head back to rolla. 
Other then that things are going as could be expected."

"event","alright so it takes me a while to update this damn thing. but he we go anyways
classes are going alright, im a little worried about physics because i need to at least get a b on this next test and a c on the final to sit at a stable C in the class. Calc 3 shouldnt be bad unless i get like a 60 on this next test and the final, so basically i just cant fuck those up. my other two classes are totally money though. If i can do good enough on my met 125 final i should be able to pull  a A, but barely. statics is a B, nothing special.
Things are going good arround the house. Rush is looking kinda blurry but i think we are about to bid about 4 guys in the coming week which would put us at 7 signed before schools out, which is very preomising.
Things are going good with lindsey, we still have trouble finding time to spend with each other, but its getting better. I like now its all going to be honest.
I got a summer job with the st joe school district mowing lawns. hours are decent and the pay is alright. not to mention its only mondays to thursdays. 3 day weekends ohh how sweet it will be.
and last but not least i plan on going home this weekend, so look for me arround joetown."

"event","well, its friday again, so here goes an update.
Currently in sitting in the IFC office for my office hours, which works out well that i managed to get this time, because on mondays and wednesdays i have to be on campus at this time, so Im glad i can keep going in some kind of a routine. So after replying to a stupid forwarded email my cousin sent me about some girl not pulling over for an unmarked police car and calling #77 to get ahold of the Highway patrol. Either way I pulled out some of my useless knowledge and remembered that the number to get a hold of HP in missouri is 55 and the number in kansas (where she has lived for most of her life) is actually *hp, or *47
so i totally served her. And now im probably just going to waste like 30 minutes looking through facebook or something.
My grandparents are coming down today too, and are going to stop here and take me out to dinner and ill probably show them around campus. They are just going to be here tonight as they are going to be driving through to georgia. So yeah, free dinner is gonna be sweet. 
And after all that, im going to be going to campus man to support mike. i actually convinced him to shave some stuff into this chest and back hair, you that should at least be comical."

"event","well, i guess its time for the weekly recap. This weekend most of my house went to conference in kc. which netted us cort of honor and a hugh shields award(the highest two awards in the fraternity) so thats awesome. wish i couldve been there, but i needed to stay here to be in charge of the house, which would have been cooler if there had been more than 3 other people here. but its alright, to be honest i didnt want to have to make that drive anyways
so instead, friday night i started to finish the coat of arms on my wall, which i did get finished, but on saturday. but about 6 or 7 lindsey came over and we watched tv for a while and then watched troy. she left about 12:30 to go be with her sister (sorority) because it was her birthday. 
then tonight i went out with all those people to eat at el magueys and then we went over to hang out at AEPi. i was sober during all of this weekend btw. but to be honest i had a great time anyways, it was fun."

"event","well, i suppoose its about time for a week/weekend recap. initiation was last weekend, so zach and adam are full fledged delts, which is kinda nice because right now everyone in house is fully initated. it kinda lets everyone at ease i think. less ""secrecy""
and because of the MLK day we only had to worry about 4 days of school this week. which was nice due to me only having 2 classes on tuesday. Overall im going to guess that this semester is going to go much better than the last. I think i worked myself up a little to much last seemster and let myself get ""scared"" of phys 23 and calc 2. everyone saying it was thier worst semester wast much help either. but seeing as how i made it. i kinda feel recharged about school. Physics 24 is going to be the ""hard"" class for me this semester i think. just because looking through the book was boring. I'm not really interested in the crap we are doing now. Calc 3 is going to be tough too because they arnt going to be collecting homework.which is going to hurt me negativly. Statics will probably be my ""easy"" class, even though i doubt its going to be easy at all. But i like the pace we are going at in there and its the stuff what i can picture much better. my Met class, is going to be a bitch becasue its basically a chemistry class, and i hate chemistry with a passion (yeah i know, im basically a specialized materials science major but i still hate chemistry) thats the school roundup i suppose.
as far as my extracuriculars go, i think im going to enjoy IFC a lot more now that im a junior rep. And im getting a lot more respect now that the Ad Sales have been over for a while. Those hurt me last year because its basically a first year reps most important responsiblity and i totaly sucked at it. But now that im being asked to do other stuff, i think i've managed to put a good face forward and people have noticed. I guess ive fallen into a groove were im active in the house, and with IFC so its forcing me to keep up with school because i know if i dont its going to make me fall behind. I guess you can say ive really been on the ball.
And speaking of IFC, im going to be heading up to STL next weekend to go to some shitty greek leadership conference. im not really to excited about it because st louis is big and scary. I think im going to be going up there friday night and going to the shinedown concert. because the conference is only on saturday. its going to be over at like 4 or 5 in the afternoon, so im not really sure if i want to stay in STL saturday night. I think ill make up my mind on the spot for that.
Febuary 3rd is the division conference for the house. but im staying in rolla until saturday afternoon, because im just going to sneek up there for the awards ceremony. booth says we scored really well with our awards packet and AAA form. so i think we are definatly contenders for the court of honor award (Top 20 chapters in the fraternity) and there is even a chance for a Hugh Shields award (top 10 chapter) which is basically what to shoot for every year. 
Back to local news i suppose. Our house had the first party of the new year and it went really well. we had a good turnout and people enjoyed themselves. I talked to lindsey that night too, and that went well too considering how things were going for us prior to that. im not going to go into that story though. I invited her along that sunday night for our initiation dinner at the ground round and she came over afterwards and partied with us. i really enjoyed myself and it all went well. When the week came i was kinda bummed, because well neither of us have freetime to hang out. she has a lot more going on than i do.
and then jumping to this weekend, friday night was a IFC recruitment social, and i brought Joe Houston with me because i think i got him talked into being the house's next rep. i think he can handle it fine. Lindsey and Laura were there too, so after the social we walked to the actual party, but we really didnt stay long because thier party was for the most part pretty weak conpaired to parties that usually happen there (phi kaps). Walking to the party was more eventful than the party in my opinion. going no less that half a block was enough for lindsey and laura to get into some kind of arguement, i dont know about what, because they asked me to walk ona  bit so they could talk, which was fine by me, i did not want to get involved in that shit. they yelled, they cried, they laughed, it was epic. But walking the 1/4 mile to the party was the coldest walk of my life. it was freakin cold that night. and the sober ride from the party was definatly the back of a pickup truck, so that was obviously the coldest truck ride ever. 
Then jump to yesterday when i get a call arround noon from tyler saying he was thinking about coming down to rolla, and i was all about that. so he got here about 6ish and him cayty, lindsey and myself ate at applebees. then we went over to a century club with the Pi Kapps and that was fun. Tyler and me were drunk. it was crazy. we got back to the house and he pretty much passed out in 30 to 40 minutes. Lindsey got a ride over here from a party she went to (she went to something with laura and some of her friends) i totally wasnt expecting her to show up but hey, i'm not the type of person to turn down guests. so we all watched wake up ron burgandy and i was still really drunk, actually i probably only go worse as the night wore on. Im going to spare the details but i was hilarious as usual. And then i ended up crashing on Mike's new beanbag couch. i didnt mean to, but i had not sit on it yet and it was confortable so i pretty much fell asleep. at least thats the story im going with. and now im more or less here typing this. 
this has got to be my record long post or something, because it took forever to write. seriously."

"event","being the well rounded person i am, i was reading some forums tonight (im not tired, not going to be sleeping for a while) and i came apon a gem of a topic which was a guy explaing how his family loves toby keith (the country singer) and well this guy obviously doesn't. Anyways, he was using customer reviews off of amazon.com and making fun of the things people said in them. funny as hell when he was tearing these people apart. Now myself, never really caring about country music to any extent, with only an occasional song I like( except for garth brooks who is a musical genius) . Im going to post the lyrics to toby keith's ""taliban song"" from letssingit.com, you judge the guy for yourself.


I'm just a middle-aged, middle-eastern camel herdin' man 
I got a little 2 bedroom cave here in North Afghanistan 
Things used to be real nice and they got out of hand when they moved in 
They call themselves the Taliban 
(ooooo yeah the taliban) (ooo the taliban baby...oo yeah) 

Now I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here 
They make her wear a scarf over her head that covers her from ear to ear 
She loves the desert and the hot white sand 
But man she's just like me, nah she can't stand 
The Taliban (ooo the taliban baby) 

But you know someday soon we're both gonna saddle up and it'll be 
Ride Camel Ride 
My old lady she'll be here with me, just smilin' right by my side 
We should do just fine down around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan 
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban 

I know where you comeing from brother, This is a patriotic love song, so y'all feel free 
to salute if ya want to, I give ya permission. 

Now they attacked New York City cause they thought they could win 
Said they would, stand and fight untill the very bloody end 
Mr Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran and said Now, you 
son's a bitches you better not be doin any business with the taliban 

So we prayed to Allah with all of our might 
Untill those big U.S. jets came flyin one night 
They dropped little bombs all over thier, 'Holy Land' 
And man you should have seen em run like rabbits, they ran 

You know someday soon we're both gonna saddle up and it'll be 
Ride Camel Ride 
My old lady she'll be here with me, smilin right by my side 
We should do just fine down around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan 
We'll bid a fair audo and flip a couple fingers to the Taliban 

We'll bid a fair adieu and flip a big boner to The Taliban

After two weeks of classes, it is now finals week coming up. i have 4 finals, one on tues, two on weds, and one thursday morning, so im either going to be home thursday or friday, i cant decide when i want to leave. Its definatly not been my best semester here, but i can say i survived.
We invited the westminster delts down last night for a founders day dinner, and 4 of them showed up, which we expected due to them having finals next week as well. Played a few drinkning games as well, and i even beat junior and dick at beer pong by myself. then a short time after that, madson said there was a gathering going on over at another house, so we rolled on over there and i had a blast. And today im going to review some stuff for calc, and nothing to special elsewise."

"event","ok well, here it goes, big post-thanksgiving update.
for starters went home last tuesday afternoon, got back to st joe arround 4, saw the parents, grandparents, and then hung out with the gang. nothing to out of the ordinary for a trip home. i think wednesday was more exciting, worked with peter and carrie, so the band was pretty much back together except for amber, who i meant to call but never got arround to. i think im going to get peter over the break and try to take her out to lunch sometime for old times sake. anyways, back to the comedy option. first of all, im going to finish talking about work. it was kinda strange to work full days again, but whatever i think i handled it well, peter and me got all the christmas decorations put up at the resturant. and at some point on saturday i think it was, i left jackie a note at work saying something along the lines of 

""Jackie,
please tell carrie (ketter for those not in the know) that she needs to marry me.

Love, your future brother-in-law
Joe""

now of course that is playing off the fact that nothing would make my mother happier than a Brunner-Ketter union. i think its funny and its not like anyone is going to actually take it seriously. but seriously, mom used to nag me about tring to ask her out. it was annoying.

so anyways, that pretty much sums up work. nothing to crazy there

then i think it was wednesday night that we all ended up hanging out at jayne's house, and of course im sure i spelled her name completely wrong, so my bad. but this wouldnt be such a big deal, except me being the only ""single"" guy there it got all played out of proporsion that i was tring to get some play from her, even though i was never within like 10 feet of the girl and made no advances or even flirted, not even the signature ""brunner lean"". Not that i really care what the guys say, well because anything they say about me i probably deserve, as at any given time talking to them i am making a joke about them and one of thier signifigant others. but it was a fun time anyways, not like we had anything better to do.

and then thursday night i think, tyler, litton and me were chilling over at Melissas watching aqua teen, where i ended up falling asleep on the couch and being woken up at like 2 something am. but saturday night was definatly the most entertaining night as i went with reel, dj, and payes downtown to hang out at shooters and then we went to this party in a old department store, which was honestly really cool. up until it got broken up at like 2:30 in the morning. luckily for me i had arranged for a sober and someone to come get my car much earlier in the night, as of course i was not in any condition to drive home after that. so then when i get home, after thanking the jeffers sisters for thier assitance in getting myself and my car home, i discovered that some pieces of southside crap(nothing against southsiders, but these guys are pieces of shit who are messing arround with my sisters, hince the crap comment) had tp'ed the house and dumped bags of shreded paper in the yard. so that made me pretty angry, plus i had been drinking so it got amplified a lil bit.

then my sister laura was sick with strep, so she was awake so of course i was in the mood to talk to people, so i stayed awake for a bit and talked to her. said stuff about being social, and not messing with southside boys. yeah i was still mad about that. and then a lil while after that i went to bed, and woke up to the sound of dad talking in a raised tone out in the hallway. he was also very pissed about the paper in the yard as that is what it was about. basically he made the girls go outside and clean it up since they had not made it clear to the boys that they were to stop leaving toiletpaper and crap in our yard, and he also told them to call the kids and make sure it never happened again. then i fell back asleep and woke up at like noon, dicked arround for like 3 hours, got all my laundry done and got back to rolla at about 9 pm.
now i just have to get into study  mode and really push these last 2 weeks of class to get my grades into good shape and do well on finals, so yeah, thats the recent stuff, sorry for the poorly organized ramblings you just read."

"event","well, its the cool thing to post now, and its been a while since ive posted so lets see what i can do here. I'll start with last night while the image is still fresh.
The night started out with kevin and me being cheap and making some hamburger helper we found downstairs, because i had already blown my weekly cash allowance on beer and schnapps. it was a 3 day weekend so i had to buy a little extra otherwise by the time saturday rolled arround i would have had nothing to do but watch drunk people (yeah like 5 drunk people, because thats all the people who stayed this weekend.). So yeah chris kelly was down last night because he is in the process of moving from BFE arkansas to Jefferson city and it just so happens that rolla is right between them, being the ""Middle of Everywhere."" and cut back to like 2 weekends ago when madman and wolken were down here, they had stopped by a beer distributor on the way here from STL and the distrib place gave them a whole bunch Pabst Blue Ribbon beer that was just over its drink by date, meaning they couldnt sell it so they might as well give it away. so cut back to this weekend when we are all sitting out in the delt-o (our outdoor lounging area) and junior says, ""yeah there is a whole bunch of PBR 40's in my fridge that anyone can have because i hate PBR"" and then cut to me going, hell yeah that means i can drink my own good beer next weekend and not have to but more next weekend. Truth be told, PBR isnt really that bad, it just gets that reputation because its cheap. So anyways thats how that night started. then after like 2 40's kevin and me get the great idea to work on the bottle of warm tequla in our room. bad idea, after that my stomach basically gives me the big fuck off and i had to stop drinking, but fortunatly didnt get sick or vomit or any of that fun stuff. but apparently kevin passed out on the bathroom floor later that night, because yeah he blew alot.

but otherwise rolla has been pretty calm, greek week was last week and man was that alot of fun, its hard to explain what i mean to someone who doesnt go to school here, but yeah, if i get my IFC committee, which i should because apparently alot of the new members of exec like me and think i do a decent job, i should get my jacket in late november i think is what wolken told me, but i really dont care when as long as i know its coming to me because i worked my ass off for it, really"

"event","so i rode home in litton's trunk last night just because ive never rode in a trunk before, but it was actually pretty nice. i wasnt even drunk its just ive always wanted to ride in a trunk just to check that off the list of things to do before i die. now i just have to bang a set of hot sextuplets and im set.
for the most part im ready to go back to school, im just going to work a few more days to get some last minute cash money to set me till thanksgiving/christmas time when i can work to ensure my finances till next summer. exciting i say.
joetown is always nice, poor bill is still under the influence of his lovely lady, and i hope he can get her claws out of him before he completely severes himself from the crew, i like bill but the dude can only help himself at this point. and besides that i cant say anything else has really happened. so on that note im going to crash for the night"

"event","Denver was awesome and i can positivly say that i took alot of positive things away from it. not to mention i was doing the shocker in the pictures we took with jidge verity and carl somethingorother(former and newly elected international vicepresidents for delta tau delta) but those were only the pics we took with mikes camera. i didn;t do anything stupid when we used booths camera though. 
but yeah i walked away with a new attitude about the house and being a delt in general, all good attitude though
my only regret would be that i actually let myself drive to denver by myself...the kansas plains arnt exactly what i would call entertaining. although i saw the church that is in the end of the movie ""The Rock"" you know the one with alcatraz and the rockets with sean connery. yeah that was exciting for the first 3 seconds i realized it was the same church, and then i was like...ohh wait im the only one in the car and no one is going to care....back to the 7 more hours of driving.

with school rapidly approaching, in about 10 days no less, i need to get my ass into work and scrape out that last bit of summer money to hold me till christmas. yeeah"

"event","grandma had surgery today, she had a ulcer in her stomach that was causing stuff, but the doc says it should be fine now and she should heal up fine, which is good because she was in alot of pain before.
in other news im going to colorado wednesday and will be returning sunday night, unfortunatly i think that means im going to be missing tylers sisters visit to joetown, damn my luck. and im going back to school the 12th, which is fun because i kinda have a differnt perspective going in the 2nd year and at the same time i get to see all the people i know going for thier first years go through some of the stuff i did last year, with assorted ""i leave in XX days"" countdowns and the like. suckers."

"event","so this morning i get up, shower and spend a few minutes on the internet reading comics or whatever the flavor of the day was. then I close the laptop and go to work.
Fast forward to 1:30 when i come home for lunch break, and i walk into my room and i see that my laptop is open now, no biggie seeing as how my sisters are shitbags and for some reason dont even try to hide when they come us my stuff. but no damage done, untill i sit down and notice that my L key is missing off my keyboard. first of all, the keys are not spring loaded, so there is no reason for the key to not be on my desk, but its gone. so that adds to the list of stupid shit that my sisters do. so after giving them the benefit of the doubt because they all said they knew nothing about it, i called Litton, as he would be the only other person i would consider the culprit, because well the L key was gone and he was at my house last night, so i figured he may have left something here, and came by on his lunch hour to get whatever it might have been. i would never put a joke past him, and if it was him he would fess up to it because its only funny to him if you know its him. so i get ahold of him later and he says it wasnt him. so i decide my sisters are lying and called home and it was laura who picked up the phone. i said ""Listen, tell your sisters that unless i find that L key sitting somewhere on my desk when i get home, im going to personally strangle each one of you until the key is found"" then i get a call about 3 minutes later saying it was found. god i love how death threats work so well on my sisters."

sure it was probably a poor adaptation of the original short stories, but in my opinion it was still pretty damn good. it had plot, action, and i gotta say that i think will smith was the perfect guy for the part. that being said im going to bed now, as i have to get up semi early to take the car in to finally get the top fixed."

"event","i just read the batman : ""hush""  series and i must say that im very very impressed. even though i had heard some things that i though would totally spoil the series for me, i was supprised as hell to the actual events of the series. ive been spending alot of time reading comics and such lately, mainly because its cheap (free in fact if i download them off the internet) off ebay. im more of a fan of superman and batman than the other heros. its so blazingly simple, yet they are very smart reads at the same time. not to mention any story is fun to read when there is good artwork to go along with the story.
might be going to worlds of fun saturday, but i never really know. id definatly like to though."

"event","well, day 2 of 5 of the 10.5 hr workweek is over, and i must say its been moving pretty fast. but im also pretty drained at the same time. i plan on playing a little ultimate tomorrow, then going out to the geiger reservation for the thursday night spectacular, and i also told howard i was going to go, so i had better not cross that man. im not going to be canoeing this weekend, which is a disappointment,seeing as how i gladly cover for anyone needing me to work for them and in return i get told ""they are busy"" the one time i have asked to get some cover by all 4 potential people who could cover for me. apparently doug and tim requested my presence down at the house friday afternoon for whatever reason, and i can;t go so im upset because doug is my hero next to bill clinton and batman. so you can tell it is a very esteemed list to be on. ohh well, there is always karnea at the end of the month, which im going to go no matter what. the model (1970 impala of course) is coming well, as i just got the engine all assembled and painted to the exacting standards of the instructions (there are black and red AND chrome paints on the engine). thats all i really feel like typing right now, if i forgot something good, ill add it on the morrow"

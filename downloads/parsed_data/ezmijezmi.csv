<P><FONT color=#cc66cc size=5><STRONG>Seefoammgreentux</STRONG>: as the realization that we <EM>are</EM> going home, and the year <EM>is</EM> over there comes a very unexplainable saddness. the Mac Attack is slowly disesembling. We are leaving these walls, the last time all of us will ever live together. Funny huh? 20 people who knew nothing about each other in september are now so upset about not seeing each other for a little while. I am going to miss you all SO much!!! To those of you who are questioning if you are coming back next year, YOU BETTER, and for those of you who we know shall never attend another class at snhu, or never did, you best get up here and visit us all! I hope everyone has a good summer, and I love you guys!! :'(</FONT></P>

"event","We spoke in pig-latin and tried to keep you out of the loop but, ehay told me in the house-ay gave my heart away. Kristina wasn't very fluent in pig-latin.

We held hands, laced fingers, traded shy smiles under the stars and went for walks down sweet-scented roads. We picked out our houses and decided to grow lots of plants in our front yard one day. We all slept together, embracing and entwining our bodies, so tight-knit, one heart beat. I felt safe in your arms, in the arms of that summer with you. The sun was shifting through the blinds and I made the lights dance across the room by tapping on them, I was intrigued, it made a soft clack clacking noise as they swung from side to side and you grabbed my hand and hid it in yours. Light played across your face as a smile bloomed on your lips and I wanted to kiss you and taste love, affection, for the first time. My heart was pumping so fast, hammer hammer, it almost hummed - but I never did brush my lips against yours in the summer rays, only hidden in dark bedrooms with loud music and laughter. All the same, that day sticks out in my memory. You smelled like laundry detergent and deodorant and I couldn't keep a smile off my face as I felt my hand in yours, warmth spread from your fingertips to mine as if by magic and I felt like I had a piece of you with me. As the days turned gray and cold I grew familiar with your hands and they hung heavy and limp, like stones, in mine as we marched habitually around together, not talking, not feeling - but they came alive as smoke creeped around us during the night, and I played with your elephant fingers, making them bellow and trump loudly, laughing and kissing each fingertip while Kristina blew smoke rings into the ceiling. In a way, we were all in love with each other. She glowed golden and her eyes were bright blue circles, happiness enveloped us all like the smoke she exhaled daily. We danced in her livingroom until all hours of the night and ate Little Ceaser's pizza while watching pornography, took long walks and discovered new places, new feelings, new identities. Maybe we weren't in love with each other so much as we were in love with that summer - it held us safe under it's wing and loved us tenderly, kissed our eyelids as we fell asleep in the grass under a sky dribbled with stars, wishing stars.

I wished for you a million times. A billion times, a trillion times.

I've never felt so safe. It was a summer fling - not between you and I, but between the summer and all three of us. It hugged us close, kept us warm, loved us tenderly and dumped us into spring without a second glance. I know it doesn't miss us like I yearn for it. I should have left a Hansel and Gretal crumb trail back to our tree in the center of the sky, but I was so wooed and in love with everything that I forgot to be wary and swallowed the bread whole while distractedly staring at the green in your eyes. We had our cake and ate it too, and now we're all paying for it. No summer will ever be as great or as perfect, I will never be loved the same way again.

All I can see is our faces through the camera lens, laughter etched in our skin and smiles on our tongues. It makes me love you all the more.

I should have wished for that summer to never end because I already had you. A million times, a billion times, a trillion times - you were mine."

Again.

But it's getting better, slowly.

Beck and I talked yesterday! It turns out she doesn't hate me. Man, I really miss her. .-. She's moving in with Josh finally, and that means so long, Beckz place. I'm going to miss it so much, it was definitely a huge part of my life. 

<lj-embed id=""10""/>

I spent a lot of my time there, obviously, seeing as how I <i>lived</i> there... times with Sean, times without Sean, times with Jeff, times with eLan, times with Molly, and (of course) tons of times with Beck and Buffy and Mona and Delilah and Tallulah. I won't just miss it, I'll probably mourn it. I get too attached to things like that.

I'm not giving the key back :x

So this psychic bitch in Arizona told me that I should become an Author and go to college for English - I wish she would have told me more, I mean, I've always considered my writing as something I could fall back on, not my main career. That scares me, it's an iffy thing. But, then again, who says I'm used to stability? I'll probably work better under the pressure. I'm taking what she said to heart, even though I'm still skeptic. It's what I wanted to do, anyway, so why not?

She didn't say if I'd be successful or not. :\

I just need to focus more on my writing and less time on Rockband. I need to channel some of that energy on getting a motherfucking JOB also. Then I'll be happy, I think. 

It's 12:36p.m. and I'm about to eat breakfast, go me. Peace."

We have this all planned out already, because everyone knows it's coming.

EVERYONE. It's just a matter of who's not afraid to ADMIT they know it's coming, you know?

I'm prepared. And so are my friends. I'd roll with us, just to be safe, but if you're fucking bitten there will be none of this, ""Oh you're my friend so even though you're showing ALL THE SYMPTOMS of turning into a zombie, I'll believe you and put my own life in jeapordy"" bullshit - your ass is getting capped the first SIGN of a frayed wound or paling skin or puke or yellowing eyes. Got it?

Kay, so, I don't understand why it takes forever for main characters to transform into zombies, but then as soon as some insignificant character gets bitten they immediately turn into this brain-consuming freak. It just doesn't make any sense. I'm not taking any chances. I will shoot you, in the face, and move along.

If you start hiding out in basements and avoiding people, I WILL FUCKING SHOOT YOU. Jesus.

And no fucking zombies, or getting impregnated by zombies. I don't want to deal with your crazy zombie baby. It's disgusting, they're ugly, and just because you're not PERSONALLY a zombie, you causing me stress and annoying me will bring a gun to your face. 

Bring water. Bring supplies. DON'T BE THAT WHINY PUSSY ASS BITCH, BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT BITTEN, I WILL SHOOT YOU FOR BEING A PUSSY. Bitches. I don't want to have to do all the work and worry about you FUCKING UP because you're too scared to shoot a zombie in the face. None of this damsel-in-distress shit, girls kick ass and if you're afraid of chipping your nails while beating off a zombie, you're on your own. Please don't count on the men to save you, because if they're looking out for your sorry ass, chances are they're not looking after their OWN asses and are therefore probably getting bitten and/or eaten alive/shot by me in the face. You're basically killing all the people who can fight by being a scared, whiny little cunt. STFU. SHOOT IT IN THE FACE. It's not that difficult. If I hear you complaining I won't shoot you, I will dangle you in front of the zombies and watch them eat you alive. Thanks.

And if you're a MAN that's whining, you're shit out of luck because if you don't have magnificent tits or a vagina, chances are the men aren't going to protect you and the women probably just won't care, so, sucks for you. Be a man. Fight. Don't cry in corners or beg people to help you out. We're not dying for some faggot.

If you bring your kids, you take care of them. I'm not baby-sitting while trying to survive. Kids just cause problems because they're stupid and they tend to do things like leave doors unlocked and shit. Keep them close, and if we have to run I hope to God your kids are fast runners, because I'm not staying behind to try and hurry them up. Piss. Also, kids can't keep quiet in situations where you might need to be quiet. If your toddler starts crying while we're trying to hide from flesh eating Zombies I will immediately shoot it in the face and then proceed to use it as bait to lure the zombies AWAY from those still living.  

I could go on and on, but I'm not going to. I'm worked up enough as it is. I planned out my Zombie escape plan months ago with Beck and it's pretty solid, we've got it all set out. We're not taking any SHIT when that day comes, and we're pretty much going to kick a ton of zombie-ass. 

I really want to go watch some zombie movies now, my obsession has been revived."

"event","So, I'm walking back through the airport terminal, distractedly staring at my feet and trying to keep up with Papabear. The surreality of the situation bothers me, I'm still sort of dazed.

Europe.

""Okay, our code word is 'creamcicle', you got it?""

She nods. A woman with fake blonde hair smiles at us, as if she understands. Bitch doesn't know shit about shit, in my opinion. I smile back.

""You get kidnapped? You call me and say the code word and I will personally come to Europe and save your ass. Kay?""

She nods again. She has two sips of AMP in her system and 48 hours worth of no sleep, so she looks a little less than pumped. Her eyelids are drooped and she has this silly, stupid smile on her face, but I hug her again anyway.

And then, just like that, we're walking back towards the car. I had two minutes to say good-bye to my best friend while she took off on the trip of her life, and I expect some wave of sadness or bitterness or jealousy to sweep over me as I shuffle through the crowded hall, but nothing happens.

It irks me.

We approach the escalator and I step cautiously onto the moving stairs because my shoes are untied. I've always had this huge fear of getting stuck in an escalator, my shoelace getting caught in the grinding gears and sucking me up into it, tearing up my flesh and munching my bones. I know I could probably take my shoe off before I got turned into a bloody mess, but logic does nothing to soothe me. Every time I step onto an escalator my heart grips. 

At this point, I still have the fear but am too sleepy and lazy to bend over to loop swoop and pull. Instead, I just bite my fingernails nervously until I jump onto the concrete sidewalk below. 

Europe.

I explore my feelings, expecting certain things and not really finding them. There's a little bit of bitterness, a pinch of jealousy, a hint of sadness - it's funny, I know myself so well that I'm surprised at my lack of negative feelings towards the situation. I stumble upon this pulsing, overwhelming sense of excitement and glee for her.

I'm happy?

I'm <i>happy</i> she's leaving me here for however long? I'm happy she gets to explore and venture through unfamiliar streets while I sit at home in her house eating her food sleeping in her bed, waiting for her to return? I'm happy she gets to meet guys with British accents, that she gets to eat new foods and shop for things and sleep in hotel rooms and hear different languages and make new friends?

I'm jealous, alright, but this jealousy doesn't feel slimy. 

As we drove out of the parking lot I pictured her sitting on the airplane, looking around, smiling to herself as it finally hits her, after all the months she's been waiting -

<i>I am going to Europe</i>.

She better bring me back something delicious to eat, that's all I have to say."

That's how I woke up this morning. I'm getting sick and tired of my brother's bullshit. I didn't TOUCH his stupid towel.

""I don't have your towel!""

""YES YOU FUCKING DO IT WAS IN THE BATHROOM YESTERDAY!""

""I DIDN'T TOUCH YOUR FUCKING TOWEL, CHRIS! GO AWAY!""

""NO, LET ME IN I WANT TO LOOK!""

I'm asleep, naked, in bed and he demands to come into MY room and look for a towel I DON'T have? No.

""I. DON'T. HAVE. IT!""

""YES YOU FUCKING DO LET ME IN!""

So I get up and look for his stupid smelly as balls towel and find nothing.

""What a surprise, I don't fucking HAVE it.""

""LET ME IN!""

""Uhm, no.""

POUND POUND POUND on the door. (GRUNT GRUNT CAVEMAN ANGRY!)

""<b>LET ME IN RIGHT NOW!</b>""

""I DON'T HAVE YOUR STUPID MOTHERFUCKING TOWEL NOW GO AWAY!""

So he stomps down the hall and I think I'm good, so I start to fall back asleep. And all of a sudden I hear something outside my bedroom window. 

My brother climbed onto my ROOF and tears the screen out and is like, ""I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!""

I'm still naked by the way. He tells me to get under the covers and jumps down into my room.

He looks.

He looks.

He looks.

What? What, Christopher? No towel? What a fucking shock.

""I DON'T KNOW WHY ALL MY SHIT HAS TO DISAPPEAR WAH WAH WAH!""

""Well, I told you I didn't have it, you idiot. Now get out.""

He pulls my towel out of pile of towels, spits snot into it, then throws it on the ground. Then he takes my other towel and stomps out of my room, leaving the door wide open.

""DON'T EVER CALL ME AN IDIOT!""

This shit is making me a nervous wreck. I can't stand him, I can't stand him, I can't fucking stand him. He makes me so angry, I honestly just wish he would O.D. or commit suicide or something.

Jeff, Brandon, eLan and I went to Denz last night. Brndn locked his keys in his car, hah, so we had to wait for some man to unlock his car. It was pretty average other than that. Beck got off early, yay, and ate food with us.

I had three scoops of ice cream. B]

With oreos!

eLan was sleepy so they (""they"" being Brandon and him) left for home while Jeff, Beck and I went to the gym. I got hit in the face with a fucking basketball and Jeff made fun of me relentlessly for being a KylaKlone. I didn't work out, I just played pokemanz on my new DS and watched them sculpt their guns. It was a pretty comfortable situation, allthough, admittedly, I missed Sean a lot. I can't help thinking about him when I go to the gym and it makes me feel odd. Especially when some bitch is singing ""I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOUUUUUUUU"" over the radio while memories of Sean and I being cute flood in. It was the only weird part of the night, and it left me a tad empty and confused.

I'm not anymore. I can't hide the fact that Sean and I had something, or that I do miss it from time to time, but I do know that I've fallen for eLan and Sean is most definitely the past. As long as I keep my head above the waters of confusion, I'll be fine - I don't feel like drowning anytime soon.

Oscar was being mean to Josh, so I drew him a picture of a penguin that was saying, ""WE <3 YOU, JOSH!""

I hope it made him feel better. :\

Also, Beck and I found a ""boomerang"" on Josh's keychain! I'm referring to the movie <i> Little Black Book</i> which consisted mainly of a girl secretly learning about her current boyfriend's ex's by befriending them and getting them to divulge past relationship secrets.

It's too complicated to explain.

I spent the night with Beck and Josh, pretty uninteresting. I lurked the internet. Fell asleep, woke up and had a million gummy bears for breakfast. Jeff was supposed to come over, but he never did like an ASS.

I danced to, what else? A Goofy Movie. Supernova Girl. Shout, by Tears for Fears. I blame the sugar.

And now I'm here, typing.

Ohhh and I took pictures of my face. :)

"event","I actually drew something semi-serious yesterday. I'm proud, and it didn't look too shabby.

Lately I've taken to watching Arrested Development all day and downing large amounts of Kool-aid. I know there is a better use of my time, especially since June 1st is approaching so rapidly, but every single time I try to actually do something I mess it up. 

Beck needs to notarize my documents so I can get an I.D. - I have decided this is my first step, because without an I.D. I can't do <i>shit</i>. I can't get a job, learn to drive, OR take the CHSPE (which I'm not even sure I'm taking anymore since I've successfully put off studying. Go me -.-) without a California Identification Card.

I'm doing that tonight at Josh's surprise house warming party. It's going to be a wild night, what with the potluck and the notarizing of documents. And such. Ha. My Dad is dumb, he thinks I'm this party girl or something. YA RITE.

I saw Tessa yesterday. I don't know if she'll ever change or grow out of this weird stage she's in, but I doubt it. And that makes me sad... she has so much potential.

Weird. Prly what everyone ever thinks of me right now.

""Potential potential potential.""

Or, at least, they used to.

That reminds me of the Mr. Magorium's Magic Emporium movie... the girl was worried that all she had was <i>potential</i>, and that that was all she was ever going to have.

sighsigh.

I really loved that movie, which surprised me; it looked pretty horrible. Honestly, though, it's probably one of my favorite movies ever because it totally reminds me of the fantasy stories I used to read as a kid. Super cute. Mr. Magorium was the sweetest old man ever.

<img src=""http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/4550/smallermsg3.png"">

The little kid, Eric, was also terribly cute. He wore a different hat every day.

<img src=""http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/7519/alsocobblerjl6.png"">
<img src=""http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/4350/cobblereg9.png"">

Seriously, if you haven't seen it you should rent it. It's an awesome movie to watch with kids.

Idky I love it so much. Probably because of this monkey:

<img src=""http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x57/s2snherb/MMWE_monkey.jpg"">

Haha.

Anyway, I can relate with the main character (Molly), because I feel like when I was younger, all anyone talked about was my potential... and now that I'm older, people are still talking about my ""potential"" and I'm just stuck doing the same bullshit I was doing years ago, and not growing at all.

<b>Molly Mahoney:</b> I'm stuck!
<b>Mr. Edward Magorium:</b> Oh, to my floor?
<b>Molly Mahoney:</b> No, sir.
<b>Mr. Edward Magorium:</b> Then what?
<b>Molly Mahoney:</b> Like, as person. You remember when I was a little girl and I could play Rahmaninov's Second Piano Concerto and everyone was talking about my potential?
<b>Mr. Edward Magorium:</b> Mhm.
<b>Molly Mahoney:</b> Well, I am 23 now and everyone's still talking about my <i>potential</i>... but if you ask me to play the song I know best, I'll still play Rachmaninov's Second.
<b>Mr. Edward Magorium:</b> May I suggest you stun the world with Molly Mahoney's First?

Love that movie. Definitely see it if you haven't already.

I've been rambling for too long about potential. I saw Tessa yesterday, and that was my point.

eLan came over last night for a bit, his van looks awesome. Seriously. I love it. We stood around outside and talked with my brother for a while, but he couldn't stay long because my Dad was periodically sticking his nose out the door and threatening to lock us out. :\

I miss him.

Gah. I'm going to go watch Arrested Development and drink more Kool-aid and wonder about my potential and still do absolutely nothing with my life."

"event","I am craving music. Srsly. There aren't any speakers on this craptastic computer, and even if there was it would take too long to load and the music would be all jarry and spazzy.

Ugh.

Still, post some new bands for me to listen to. I'm bored with all my music right now.

JUST PLZ NOTHING IN JAPANESE THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND! O.O;





Inspiration desperation. I wish I could draw better, or paint. I have a magnificent idea for a painting but I have no idea where to begin, or the talent to get it done right. Sighsigh. I just need to keep practicing and doodling, although, to be honest, I haven't done anything serious in a long while. Just cartoons. Maybe I'm afraid no one will take me seriously, because I'm such an amateur - but, I guess everyone starts out that way, right? Unless they're truly amazing art prodigies. Which I am <i>not</i>. I'm not even sure I have a writing talent anymore.

I need to read more. I <i>need</i> to read more.

This past year I've been in a real musical lull. I mean it, eLan even told me that I was seemingly ""uh-phased"" by music.

O.O

That woke me up, I don't think <i>anyone</i> has ever been able to say that about me before. I have a deep connection with music, but I don't usually like listening to it while I'm around people. I think it's more of a personal experience, especially when you encounter those music snobs who think they're superior to you just because their bands are ridiculously ""obscure"" and ""underground""... I've taken to avoiding the subject of music as much as possible. It really bothers me that people are so judgmental and scornful - I know my music taste isn't the ""coolest"" or even necessarily the ""best"", but I like what I like and I can't help it. Yes. This includes crappy 90's boy bands and Kelly Clarkson. At least I can admit it. 

I need more C.D.'s or something. Someone burn me C.D.'s and send them to me.

Haha. Sounds like a job for lol briann. I don't think he pays much attention to livejournal, anymore, though. Or me. But, that's okay, I wouldn't say that we've grown apart - well, maybe a little. A lot. I'm sad, because I'd always considered him a close friend, and now we hardly ever talk, but... we're still friends. I think. I hope. 

I don't know.

I need music.

Send me music.

Michael, send me music. 

ANYONE send me music.

I am feeling less artistic by the day, and it's making me terribly frustrated. I know I've gotten better, and I am definitely proud, I just wish wish wish I could do more. I'm 18 years old and still struggling. I suppose everyone struggles with things like this. 

When I was younger my Nanny had me believing that she was psychic. She would sit down and draw pictures of me, doodles, scrappy doodles that didn't make much sense to me. I keep remembering this picture she drew with sparks flying from my hands.

""You're going to use your hands when you're older, but not with art. With writing. Your talent is writing. You're going to write.""

That was back when I ran around in my art apron and ranted about art art art. I wrote, but only for fun and not seriously. 

And I hadn't shown her any of my writing. I'm not even sure she knew I wrote.

I know it's silly, but that picture is carved into my head. With the sparks flying from my fingers. My hands feel pretty useless right now, definitely sparkless. I've been in this lull for too long. Wayyy too long.  

I feel like I'm made completely out of stone; frozen.

But even rock can produce a spark, right? With flint. I just need something, anything, to get me going.

These are probably the last things I should be worrying about, but I can't help it. I feel like I'm slipping away."

"event","I had an incredible day. Right up top.

eLan and I had wham-bam sex, Izaak and I played catch and pokemon for hours, and I got to see all my friends at Denny's.

I arrived at eLan's house in AJ's car, which was a pretty nice (although, admittedly, sticky and hot) car ride. I feel like AJ and I aren't so distant anymore. My intimidation has left completely, and I'm honestly not sure why I felt that way about him to begin with. He's just a guy. 

Anyhow, we pulled up into eLan's driveway and all I see is him grinning, and it made my insides all fluttery. Still. Some guy was painting eLan's van, a graffiti artist guy, and man... it looks pretty fucking sick, I'm actually jealous. Haha. The colors are all intense and they make my eyes pop, in a good way. I was distracted by it a little when I walked up to eLan. We kisskissed. I felt like it'd been a couple of weeks since I'd last kisskissed him, but I thought about it later and it'd only been a few days. I am pathetic. Haha.

While we were watching some guy, a graffiti artist guy, spraying away at his van, AJ noticed a snake slithering on the driveway. I'm not much of a snake person, myself, so I kept my distance. We followed it around for a bit, contemplating catching it and chiding each other to go grab it.

""Go grab it, dude.""
""No way. YOU go grab it!""

The lady next door emerged from her house, probably to get mail or some bullshit. AJ made the mistake of asking her if she'd lost her pet snake.

""Cause there's a snake over here, in the grass.""

The lady pretty much flipped out. The snake wasn't ginormous or anything, it was just a plain old snake, but she was exaggerating and flailing and ranting about how we should dial 911.

Seriously, lady? 911? It's a fucking snake, not a burglar.

Lady: ""It's probably about two feet - no, FOUR feet long!""
AJ: ""Well, it doesn't just grow.""
Lady: ""Oh... you'd be surprised!""

She was being pretty ridiculous. The three of us were basically rolling our eyes and fighting back laughter as she carried on and on about how she didn't want it to ""break into"" the houses and get in the yards and terrorize the neighborhood. A harmless gardner snake. She grabbed the phone and dialed 911 herself when she realized we all had no intention of doing it.

Lady: ""Did you guys call 911?""
AJ: "">> They didn't pick up!""

I think we all felt pretty bad for the snake. I mean, there he was, minding his own business, slithering along and out of nowhere some crazy lady in pink starts yelping about how dangerous he is. None of us thought animal patrol was necessary, but the woman wouldn't let up.

We made fun of her relentlessly throughout the hour. It was pretty great.

A fire truck pulled up eventually, and moved the snake into a field literally ten feet away. I was annoyed and amused at the same time. Honestly, she kept doubling the snake's size and when she called in, she was like, ""THERE IS A HUGE SNAKE IN THE YARD AND IT'S HEADING FOR MY HOUSE.""

u.u

Gave us a lol, though. 

After eLan and I sat in the garage and hung out for a bit, periodically checking on the van. AJ left for an hour or so, then came back. It was pretty boring. I ate a lean pocket somewhere in there, and the three of us ended up on the couch. AJ fell asleep, most likely because of the heat, and eLan and I kisskissed. Too-Tall (eLan's Dad) came home, and, well, we stopped kisskissing and AJ left again to go pick up Jade or some bullshit. I wanted to go jump on the trampoline outside because I was hit with a sudden burst of energy I just couldn't get rid of. 

I jumped on the trampoline with eLan for a bit, then we got tired and sat on it. The sun wasn't so ridiculously hot and he looked so pretty lying out in the light like that. I was almost overwhelmed with happiness, looking at him. It felt so comfortable and nice, it wasn't even that hot anymore. I could have curled up and stayed there forever. eLan's Mom and Dad left, leaving eLan and I alone with Izaak, his 9 year old brother. After sitting outside and kisskissing for a while, he led me upstairs and we had wham-bam sex. It was pretty awesome, I'm not going to lie. Or go into detail. Just, awesome.

After we'd finished, he decided to take a shower and I decided to not. I'm not sure why, I guess I just didn't want to get my hair all messed up. I headed downstairs and Izaak and I went outside to jump on the trampoline. We started out throwing a tennis ball back and forth, but it soon evolved into playing keep away from Lola (their scraggly terrier mix), then to just hurling it at each other as hard as we could. The tennis ball eventually became a pokeball, and the flat football became an ultraball, and Lola became a Growlith, and Izaak kept changing pokemon randomly as I tried to ""capture"" him. 

He started cheating and changing pokemon and making up weird rules, so I pretended to be frustrated and told him I didn't want to play anymore because he was a cheater.

Two minutes later I hear his voice floating up the stairs:

""FIIIIIIIIINE, I'LLL PLAYYYYY. I'm YOUR pokemon, now.""

It made me lol. We wrestled with Lola, and rolled around in the grass, and pretended, and laughed and teased. I really miss being a kid sometimes, you know?

eLan's Mom and Dad came home and I sheepishly followed Izaak inside.

Izaak: ""SUNNNFLORA!""
Elan's Mom: ""?""
Me: ""He's my pokemon. We were... er... playing pokemon.""
Izaak: ""SUNNNFLORA!""
Elan's Mom: ""Ohhhhh, haha, is that what you were doing?""

She gave me a pretty weird look, so I gently rolled the dirty ""pokeball"" outside and sat next to eLan on the couch. He looked so cute, all wet from the shower. (:

I grabbed a glass of water, because being a kid is hard fucking work. I was dirty and itchy and sweaty and tired, and so happy. I brought the glass outside because it was too stuffy inside for my nasty, sweaty body. I was lying on the trampoline and staring at the night sky, slowly sipping at my water and cooling down. It was something I needed, I think.

Crackers and salami and cheese were out on the island when I slumped inside. Yummy. I was starving, and helped devour the plate of snacks before heading out with Brandon and eLan to Denny's.

Denny's was pretty fucking awesome, and so was the ride there. eLan, Brandon and I were singing and dancing to some weird funky disco shit that they listen to. It was more than fun. And actual Denny's was great, too. Jokes and laughter and food and dancing and singing. AJ was being pretty nice and I felt like I was getting along with the group outstandingly well. I felt like I fit.

Sean and Dana and Ariel and Spencer and Crystal came in with some other people. It was awkward, but not unpleasant. I miss Sean and Ariel. 

Of course, eLan was a little weird after I talked to them. I think. I might just be imagining it, but he seemed just a tad off. A smidge. Something wasn't right. We kisskissed and stuff, but just something wasn't fine. For a little while.

I got to see Beck and Josh, and all I have to say about that is that I love them, so much. Jeff bought me a key chain of lego-Squidward. 

""Hey. How are ya?""

Haha. It's so fucking sick, I'm really happy. He got Beck a Joker key chain and she almost peed.

Jeff and AJ seem to be getting along a little better, I hope, although I talked to Jeff about it later and maybe not. But they were joking and dancing! Idk, it's probably just wishful thinking.

Denz lasted a while, but we left soon after Sean and friends showed up. Thank God. AJ, Jade and Annie left but the rest of us headed to CCC where we made cars run over florescent light bulbs. We hid and giggled in the bushes and trees... it was pretty satisfying, even though I got tons of pricklies in my shirt and pants from being so stealthy.

After the last car had driven over our light bulbs, we left and dropped Katey and eLan off. Brandon dropped Jeff and I off at Denny's, where Jeff's car was. He decided to drive me home instead of Brandon, and I was happy with that.

We've been doing this thing lately where we sit out in his car and talk for hours when he drops me off. It's really nice and relaxing, because we listen to music and recline and just hang. And talk, so much, about lots of things. Mostly AJ and the group, and Sean and eLan, but... we talk about other things as well. And dance and sing. Haha. It's sweet and something I feel like our friendship definitely needs.

Anyway, with such an awesome day behind me I figured my door would be locked. Things just seem to even out like that it my life, but, to my surprise, everything was open. I left Jeff's car after he fell asleep, and found my house completely open and quiet. No fights.

Small things, mostly. I have a lot of them. Cuddling with her in the morning, reading books with her on the bed, watching her smoke while driving, showing her Avril on the internet and her trying to sing along, painting into all hours of the morning, picking out cereal, helping her clean, eating sherbet and watching Cartoon Network, the smell of her leather jacket, her goofiness, picking grapes and eating them, taking pictures of the sunset, staring at the stars, cracking sunflower seeds open and leaving piles and piles of shells all around the house. 

It's all I really have anymore. I loved her smell, and the way she talked and laughed. Her awkward, lanky walk. How her hair changed colors. 

I don't remember her much, to tell you all the truth. Maybe that's why it's so easy to forget about her.

Oh well. Happy Mother's Day."

I just wish I could find words for Elan, but it's hard still. It's not that he doesn't inspire me, it's just I can't figure out how to capture him. Not yet, at least... I'm sure it will come in time.

I just want a job, any job, maybe two. So I can work my ass off and get a two bedroom with Beck. And just have my own space where I can have sex if I want to, or play music, or sleep naked. I want red, golds and purple in my room. Curtains. Lamps, lots of light. Candles. I just need my own place. GAH.

I need to study, and soon. The CHSPE is approaching. I need to get my birth certificate and learn how to drive and take my drivers test so I can get a job so I can go to school to become an Elementary School teacher. OMFG. I just need to get things done.

Tomorrow is back to job hunting. AND GETTING MY HAIR DONE OR SOMETHING, ANYTHING. Not purple or pink (sad) but an Auburn Red. With more bangs and layers plz. 

So many things are in my way, nothing is ever easy. And I need to push past this and keep trying. I hate feeling so discouraged.

"event","How do I capture you in words? I keep trying, I keep failing, and I still have this feeling of regret trapped inside my chest. I know it was inevitable, unavoidable, destiny for us to grow apart. But I still feel like we share this connection, all of us. A connection that somehow leaves a hansel and gretel breadcrumb memory trail back to that Summer. I still feel our friendship pulsing inside of me, but I can't get to it. Memories flood in at the most awkward, random times. I get winded. I can go months without thinking so much as your name, and then suddenly, it's like I'm there again. In your house. Listening to music and eating too much pizza.

I'd like to blame it on your obvious drug addiction, but I'm not stupid enough to really believe that's what happened. It was going on long before that period in your life. It was all of us, something just wasn't clicking anymore. And then Miranda left for homeschool, I dropped out, you stopped hanging out with David because of whatever, and David and I broke up. Our entire rock solid group crumbled in a matter of months.

And we just didn't talk about it.

I know you and Miranda became best friends. I know you're happy for that, and so am I really. But all of us just broke apart into little islands. And then the islands broke up. And now we're all alone. I wake up worried some nights. I have this empty feeling in my gut when I think about you. I miss you.

I MISS YOU.

I miss us, I miss us then. It'll never be the same, I keep trying to recapture moments that have long passed. I don't know what's wrong with me. Sometimes I reach for a phone and realize I have absolutely no one to call anymore, no one to talk to at 3:00 in the morning.

Some of my best memories of you are just us talking over the telephone. The smell of night wafting through my windows, lights out, whispering into the phone. You laughing loudly on your end and me trying to muffle my laughter because I wasn't allowed on the phone. Threeway telephone calls with David, Anthony, Miranda. Mostly David, though. It became a ritual. The three of us were literally addicted to each other. I remember your Mom telling me how envious she was of us.

""I mean, honestly, you guys are like this!"" her fingers crossed over, ""I've never had something so special in my life.""

It made me bubble from the inside. 

I know not all our memories together are good ones. You calling me while high or drunk always rubbed me the wrong way, and my relationship with David caused friction between us. But I still loved you so much, it hurts not having you here. I just want to be able to walk to your house and sleep over again. I want to try on your Mom's lingerie and dance to CCR in your livingroom half naked. I want to eat ridiculous food concoctions because you never have anything edible in your home. I want to wrestle and fight over stupid shit with you. I want to talk with you, dream with you, spoon with you and cry with you. Watch movies and laugh too loud at inside jokes. Fuck it, I just want to be close to you again.

But I'm searching for something that is completely dead. You don't even live in the same house anymore. That depresses me beyond reason, honestly, I considered that place a home to us all. We've shed so much in those walls, I feel like a part of me is gone. I've always secretly taken comfort in the fact that I could knock on your window at any time and you'd welcome me inside with open arms. Familiar faces, familiar streets and things. It's all... gone. I know it's something I'm going to write about for a while.

A long while.

Kristina, David, Miranda - you've all stolen so much of my heart. I know I'm a flake and I know I don't show how much I care often, but it pains me to see how far we've all drifted. I'm not retarded, either, I know what we had was once in a lifetime. It can't be rekindled or reinvented.

I'm just so fucking thankful I got to experience it. I know it'll always be there in my heart, all of our fun times, our bad times, our emotional dramatic times. All of the love I had for each and every one of you is still here, just dusty. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, I've talked to all of you over the past year. It's hurting.

I just have no clue how to fucking fix it.

And I need to fix it, I can't keep staying up crying over friendships that don't exist anymore. Over echoing memories that are fading. I can't keep crying over something I had absolutely no control over.

I guess I just miss you guys."

"event","Sean cheated on me with Crystal. The truth finally turns up.

It crawled into my belly and died there, and now I feel sick and confused.

I've always assumed he did something with her. Assuming and knowing are two completely different things. He fucked her.

And I helped her buy the pregnancy test.

How stupid am I? Was I, really. It's in the past. I shouldn't be bothered by it, and yet I am.

Everything, every stupid stomach-clenching fear was real. It wasn't in my head. He lied to me, everything he did was a lie. Everything.

Why does this hurt? It shouldn't hurt.

He's nothing to me. Has been for a while, now. I have absolutely no feelings for him whatsoever. I find him repulsive and annoying.

But this still hurts.

What really ticks me off is the way he twisted it around so I was the one being the bitch. I am not a bitch without reason. He was spending all his time with her, excuse me if I got a little testy.

I have journal entries from that time in my life that are disgusting. It was before I had learned to open up, before SEAN HELPED ME open up to people.

I cried and hurt myself and told myself over and over again that I was being stupid and irrational and a horrible girlfriend. 

It really hurts me that I fell for his shit. It hurts me that I shed anything over him. It hurts me that I couldn't control my tears, and that he found me in his bathroom crying and made me tell him what was wrong. It hurts me that he listened, and then made me feel like the stupid one. It hurts me that he pretended to cry. It hurts me that I fell for his fake tears. It hurts me that I opened up to him. It hurts me that he fooled me into thinking he really cared. It hurts me that I wiped away his FAKE tears and he wiped away my REAL ones and I captured the moment in my heart and set it aside for later. It hurts me that I thought of it as a special moment, a rebirth on my part. It hurts me that I APOLOGIZED TO HIM instead of vice versa. It hurts me that I was so incredibly stupid.

I remembered my relationship with Sean fondly. I thought we shared happy times and had a good bond. 

Now I know our entire relationship was based on SHIT. He cheated on me. He lied to me about practically everything that was important! He UGH. dfjskjfls

I don't even KNOW the boy I dated for 9months! I don't know him at ALL. I lived with him! I gave him my virginity, my life. I put it all in his hands. What the fuck was wrong with me? I knew he had a shady reputation, I knew from experience, first-hand experience, that he would juggle girls. I just figured I'd be special.

I'd be the special one that made him happy.

And I thought I was, read his fucking blogs. It says that he was happy with me. It says that he was infatuated with me, which is more than any of his other girlfriends can claim. We were together all the time, we became one. Sean and Sarah. Sean and Sarah.

Fuck.

I thought I was something to him. Hell, he was to me. READ MY FUCKING BLOGS. I wrote about him like he was perfect. I just feel so fucking retarded and sick.

In a way, I get to say ITOLDJASO to myself. It's a weird satisfaction. I feel like shit because I was right about him, but then I feel a little smug because I was RIGHT about him. He is fucking scum. He is a loser. 

I felt bad for breaking up with him for another boy. I felt like a fucking bitch, and that's how he plays it, too. Like I'm some dumb bitch who hurt him. I didn't hurt shit. He likes being the victim, and girls love to wipe away his tears.

I at least feel better about leaving him. Holy fucking shit, I am so glad that I broke up with him. I'd probably still be dating him right now if Michael hadn't come along.

And I wouldn't be with Elan, who is honestly just the best. He's good. I am definitely glad for Elan, he is far more special than Sean.

I left Sean for another boy, which sucks. But at least I told him what was happening. 

And he had the AUDACITY to make me feel bad about leaving him. He had the nerve to act like I was this horrible girlfriend.

I gave him myself, he gave me lies and shit.

He felt like such a badass boyfriend because he had to pay for everything. I'd rather him be poor and honest, I mean really.

I just feel stupid and gross and weird. I shouldn't be upset over this at all, at ALL. I have Elan. And Elan is my favorite. 

Gah.

And dumbass Crystal. I can't believe her. Friends since 7th grade, swoops in and fucks my boyfriend, then tries to act all hunky dory with me afterward. 

What really kills me is that I helped her buy the pregnancy test. At walgreens. It was like, 1:00 in the morning and there were three other people in the condom/weird vagina cream/sex aisle. Nobody else anywhere in the store.

Just the embarrassing aisle where the THREE of us needed to be (Sean was there, too).

We raped the shelves with our eyes until we found a modestly priced pregnancy test, and then Sean paid for it.

""It's Jasper's."" She said.

I told her that if he got her pregnant I'd cut his dick off for her and make him eat it.

What a dumb bitch. I was generally concerned for her, despite the fact the she was obviously trying to get with my boyfriend.

I was a dumb bitch, too. I knew it was happening and I lapped up Sean's useless bullshit like it was sparkling cider or some shit. Jesus.

I'm glad to get that off my chest. I don't know why I'm so bothered by it, but I am. Sorry for the jumbled rant. I'm going to go sleep forever now, and not feel good enough for anyone ever."

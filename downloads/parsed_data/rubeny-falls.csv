Squidward pretends to dilike Spongebob so nnobody suspects anything.  But Squidward hates Mr. Crabs.  Who is a crab.  Think about it.  Crabs.  Snip, snip.

Which, logically thinking, would mean I don't have to use my current bat.  Also, I took a quiz today which confirmed my suspicions.  The quiz told me that, in fact, I have the personality of a stapler.  Then I took another quiz that proved yet another of my theories.  This quiz told me that the voice inside my head is a coconut bar named Fred.  Finally, I took a third quiz.  This quiz brought me some news that I had not in fact thought about.  This quiz told me that if I was a Barbie, I would be Suicide-Bomber Barbie........Welcome to my world.

I'm gonna tell you about my shedule for the week.  I wake up at 9 in the morning because I hear the phone ring from the idiotic salepeople, tell them not to wake me up or I will hire a hit man to kill them in a gruesome way, then go on the internet.  I then eat breakfast as I read other people's lj's and dj's.  Then, I water the lawn, clean my room, and start the laundry.   By now, it's 11, so I start updating my own lj, and chat with whoever's on.   At 12, I go eat lunch and watch whatever's on MTV, or VH1 for an hour.  At 1, I stop what I'm doing and watch Days Of Our Lives, and then Passions(don't ask why) At three, I go back on the Internet and do whatever.  Then I wait till my mom comes home, and then go to softball gmes or practices.  THen I come home and watch T.V. or go on the internet till I go to bed at 11:30.  Interesting, huh?"

"event","It's surprising that, while I have nothing to do during my break, I don't feel the urge to update my journal.  And I ask myself, why?  Why do I feel I need to plan my shedule around soap operas?  Why does my mom assume I have friends?  Why do Roshni and Jordan find pleasure in hellish dolls?  And most importantly, why is Disney trying to corrupt the minds of the little children by encouraging them to sing the timeless question, ""high hoe?""(if you don't know. don't ask).  I don't know, guess I have a bit to ponder.  Also, I've decided not to divorce any of my spouses because they yelled at me.  Now, I'm sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bored that I'm gonna end by saying that we waste words on lowercase and capitals."

I saw the hospital. 
Nurse the shoreline like a wound. 
We paint a lover's tryst. 
We're neither clear nor descript. 
We kept it safe and slow. 
The quiet things that no one ever knows. 
Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground. 
Today's the day it gets tired. 
Today's the day we drop down. 
Give up my body in bed. 
All for an empty hotel. 
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals. 
I contemplate the day we wed. 
Your friends are boring me to death. 
Your veil is ruined in the rain. 
By then you like to do without. 
There's nothing new to talk about. 
And though our kids are blessed, 
the parents let them shoulder all the blame. 
Keep the blood in your head and 
keep your feet on the ground. 
Today's the day it gets tired. 
Today's the day we drop down. 
Give up my body in bed. 
All for an empty hotel. 
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals. 
I lie for only you. And I lie well. Halleluh.

THe parking lot was overflowing with motorcycles(hogs), and trucks(horses), hence the tile hogs and horses.  Anywayz, I need to sleep, so heres a song, Sic Gloria Transit Glory Fades:
keep the noise low she doesn't wanna blow it
shaking head to toe while your left hand does the show me around
quikens your heartbeat it beats me straight to the ground
you don't rcover from a night like this
a victim still lying in bed completely motionless
a hand moves in the dark to a zipper
hear a boy bracing tight against the sheets barely whisper this is so messed up
upon arrival the guests had all stared dripping wet and clearly depressed he headed straight for the stairs
no longer cool but a boy in a stitch unprepared for a life od lies and failing relationships(up the stairs the station where the act becomes the art of growing up)he keeps his hands low
he doesn't wanna blow it he's wet from head to toe 
and his eyes give her the up and the down 
his stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up
but the body on the bed beacons forward and he starts growing up
the fever the focus the reasons I had to believve you weren't too hard to sell  die young and save yourself
the tickle the taste of it used to be the reason I breathed 
and now its choking me up die young and save yourself
she hits the lights this doesn't seem quite fair
despite everything he's learned from his friends
he doesn't feel so prepared
she's breathing quiet and smooth he's gasping for air
this is the first and last time he says
she fakes a smile and presses her hips into his
he keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
he's holding back from telling her
exactly what it really feels like
he is the lamb she is the slaughter
she's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her
nothing he tells her is really having an effect
he whispers that he loves her
but she's probably only looking for...
(up the stairs the station where the act becomes the art of growing up)so much more than he could ever give her
a life free of lies and a meaningful relationship
he keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
he waits for it to end
and for the aching in his gut to subside
the fever the focus
the reasons I had to believe
you weren't too hard to sell
die young and save yourself

My mom came in this morning and told me about how some chicken idiots are such wimps that they can't even insult me to my face, and have been writing nasty things behind my back(Thanks for sticking up for me Jordan and Roshni!).  They have to hide behind the ""annonymous"" user, well that isn't really my idea of an insult.  It just proves they couldn't handle me knowing, well, I could care less because I have better friends than that midget wannabe hip-hop dancer but don't got the skill.  Thank you to Jordan, Roshni, Megan, and Sheniqua for trying to warn me about her, love ya guys!(Will you marry me?!J/K, no really.  We could live in CHINATOWN!!J/K)  THank you to everyone for just being there to let me chat you up, I really appreciate it, I'm sure I'll be normal soon,J/K!  As for Natalie, I'm sorry for what happened to you but, honey, give up your grudge, because, then, some people might(and that is a BIG might) actually begin to like you(though I can't imagine why).  And, Elaine, I'm not mad at you, in fact, I sorta miss ya, and congrats on the coyote of the month!.Still maintaing my cheerfulness, BRAND NEW ROCKS!
Let me leave you with a website and message.  The website, www.muffinfilms.com , the message: Think of me when you forget your seatbelt, and then when your head goes through the windshield!  SO long!!"

"event","Well, I'm awake.  There's nothing more to say.  I'm grounded, people are mad at me, and, well, I'm awake.  I know I'm repeating myself, but I like being repetitive.  That's why I like Brand New, they say this isn't high scool over and over again.  Getting back to cheerier news, THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!  Well, at least on the intercom there was.  So, I won!  At least i think I will.  I'm not very enthusiastic today, but who would when the whole world knows about your dream to become a mortition?"

"event","W.I.T.s are driving me out of my wits!!!!!  But do you wanna know sumthing ironic?  Today's W.I.T. is about killer math tests, and i started writing my W.I.T. after taking a math test!  See how bored I am?  I'm trying to amuse myself with random happenings at school.  I REALLY need to find some friends, apparently now pinkies and thumbs don't count so now I only have 6 friends.  Honestly, what are they gonna do next?  Get rid of index fingers?  Then I'll be down to four.  You would think they were trying to rid me of all human contact!  OOPS! Did I type that out loud?  Ha Ha Ha, I made myself laugh!  Well that don't really matter 'cause there is nobody to tell.  ...nobody(and I mean NOBODY) knows the trouble I seen(or smelled)... So I'll let you get back to your ""lives"" but just remember the old man I used to know, who's look was mild whose speech was low, Whose hair was whiter than the snow,whose face was rather like a crow, With eyes, like cinders, all aglow, who seemed distracted with his woe, who rocked his body to and fro,and muttered mumblingly and low,as if his mouth were full of dough,eho snorted like a buffalo, that summer evening long ago, a sitting on a gate!!bye y'all, lataz!!!!!!!"

"event","Well, time's up! I got a Brand New C.D.!!! I kept telling peeps at school that , but they were too stupid to figure it out. I hope you're smart enough to know that by Brand New, I mean the band. Never gonna get it right, ya never gonna get it, never gonna get it right, ya never gonna get it...Sorry musta lost concentration,it always happens, it's a totally tubular c.d.! I'm back to reality!! Well, not really, but it's fun to dream. No more Mirise Detentions!! It's a good thing because she was starting to smell!(I'm not sure how often she showers, we've started a pool in class) Well, n.e.waz(I've always wanted to say, well type that!) heres the lyrics to Last Chance To Lose Your Keys: I cashed in all my chips tonight and combed my hair till it was just right.Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl, and we got something going on.You told me you can't wait to see me and then you didn't bother to even show up.This whole situation is incredibly typical, I should have seen it all along.It's girls like you that make me think I'm better off home on a Saturday with all my doors locked up tight.I won't be thinking about you baby.You call me on the phone, and you don't even want to talk.You're staring at me from across the room then turn your back when I walk up.We got inches away and i never even got close.So leave your lipstick at home.Don't pick up the phone.And don't bother to look in my direction.I should have seen it all along.it's girls like you that make me think I'm better off home on a Saturday with all my doors locked up tight.i won't be thinking about you baby.Forget everything you think you know about me.This isn't high school this isn't high school this..."

"event","I was tortured!  FIrst the great one,thats what I had to call her, made me clean the floors with a toothbrush.  Then I followed it with a polish of all 253 pairs of shoes of hers(Man, they smelled!)using""elbow"" grease, seriously, who comes up with these terms?
.  Finally, i finished with a dry run-through dusting of the room, using my tongue(I say dry 'cause now my tongue is dry).  Well, I may have juiced this up by about a toothbrush scrub, a arm polish, and a tongue dusting.  It is a possibility that I JUST had to write 60 standards.  By the way, it was ""all a dream!"", howz that for an NEA Krisco?"

Which is why I called 911 when I saw a man beating his wife tonight while walking home with Kevin.

So we come up on this corner, and I hear a loud crack (which was the guy's kid throwing the door open, I think) so I look over, and I see this man bearing down on his wife...

All I can remember is the kids screaming, and the wife yelling...

I never want to hear that again.

Ever, ever, ever.

And I gave my info to the police. I'll be glad to serve as a witness at any trial to put the son of a bitch in jail.

So we called 911. And we waited. And the fucker came out of his house. And his neighbor asked him, ""is your daughter OK?""

""Oh, she's just fucking around again.""

And it took every ounce of restraint I had to not shout obscenities at him.

Nothing makes sense, so I won't think about it

What do the old people teach us but how to die
And what do your hissy fits teach you except how to cry, pussy, cry?
The futile, the futile, it outweighs the beautiful
The futile, the futile, it outweighs the beautiful

I don't like these tiny portions or your artful abortions of sound

I'm so so so so so so so so so so tired of this place.

I'm so so so so so so so so so so tired of this feeling.

I'm so so so so so so so so so so tired of everybody.

I'm getting sick. Sick of people sick of facades and not saying what we really feel and sick of talking like nobody hears a word I fucking say so you can all just go fuck an animal for all I care.

Guess what, I don't <I>care</I> what you want anymore. I don't have <I>time</I> to give a shit about you. I don't have the <I>shit</I> left to give, you're full of it already, why should I give <I>more</I>?

I want the whole world to disappear. I've been severely discouraged. I can't even <I>think</I> about functioning like a <B>normal</B> human being, let alone what I'm <B>supposed</B> to be.

You're all so goddamn <B>depressing</B>.

And those of you I actually enjoy can't seem to spare me five minutes over the rest of the world, so whatever.

You're so fixated on allllllll the things that just DON'TDON'TDON'TDON'TMATTTTTTERRRRRRRRRR.

Pull your head out of your ass, eh? Save us the bitching about how all you see is bullshit.

lksfjdfkdfsdfjkdf

You say you want money, girls, friends, answers, well you can start by going ahead and fucking yourself because it'll get you closer than any of your BITCHING will. You call me a whiny little bitch when you can't seem to shut your own mouth? I have my own problems, I don't need YOU fuckers adding to it by calling me a FAKEFRAUDWHATEVER. <B>If you need something to make you feel better about yourself, then don't use putting me down as a solution.</B>

Last I checked we were still human, though I can't seem to tell the difference between the rest of the world and slimy fucking roaches.

Well, guess what?

I'm sick of having a heart and feeling and all sorts of otherlkjerlkajsf;lkajsdf;lk BULLSHIT.

Do you know that if RIGHT THIS MOMENT I were to hear one of you died I wouldn't feel a SHRED of remorse for a good ten minutes?

I really forgot to care that you hate me this time.

Guess what? In two years I'll be <B>out of this steaming shitpile for the rest of my fucking life while you all rot in your own piss.</B>

I'll be laughing when your 'friends' you so casually regard so much higher than me won't show enough care to bury your ass in the shit you stand on when you die.

And I'll be laughing when it turns out a pretty face won't get you much more than an STD from the girl who was too cute to ever look at me.

Go fuck yourselves, world. I hope you all die soon and painfully, every last one of you ungrateful heartless assfucks. :]</lj-cut>"

"event",") You are walking through a forest. What does it look like?
Pine trees. It's cold. There's snow on the ground. Not a living thing for miles. Empty. Alone, but beautiful in its own sense.

2) You walk through the forest until you find a body of water. What does it look like?
A relatively small brook. The water is cold and flows fast. Small, smooth stones litter the bottom.

3) You keep walking and find a jar. What does it look like?
Chipped at the top. The lid is missing. It's a little dirty.

4) You run into a bear. What do you do?
Play dead, or find my way back before it notices me.

5) You find a key. What does it look like?
Old. Rusted in places. A dark gold color.

6) You find a stone. What's it look like?
Smooth, shining. Frosted over. Strange colors cover it.

7) You leave the forest. What do you see beyond it?
Mountains. Empty, cold mountains.

8) What do you think of when you hear the word destruction?
Man.


Meanings: 

1) The forest represents your life.
Relatively accurate.

2) The body of water represents your sex/love life.
I wish.

3) The jar is your marriage.
...

4) The incident with the bear is how you deal with problems.
I don't know about that...

5) The key is your knowlege.
...

6) The stone is your heart.
...

7) What you see past the forest is your future life.
Hm.

8) The image from the word destruction is your demise.
That much I can believe."

Your views are most similar to those of Christianity. Do more research on Christianity and possibly consider being baptized and accepting Jesus, if you aren't already Christian.

Christianity is the second of the Abrahamic faiths; it follows Judaism and is followed by Islam. It differs in its belief of Jesus, as not a prophet nor historical figure, but as God in human form. The Holy Trinity is the concept that God takes three forms: the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Ghost (sometimes called Holy Spirit). Jesus taught the idea of instead of seeking revenge, one should love his or her neighbors and enemies. Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross to save humankind and forgive people's sins.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='83' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>83%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='67' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>67%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='54' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>54%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='46' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>46%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='46' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>46%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='38' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>38%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='33' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>33%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='33' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>33%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='4' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>4%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

blind. beautiful. everything.

Somewhere, someone is...
living life like a dream

I will always...
love music

Forever is...
a droplet of water running fast through an ocean's currents tossed around by the breath of god's hand

I never want to...
see my loved ones suffer

I think the current President...
is getting wayyyyy too much shit for the kind of good job he's been doing

When I wake up in the morning...
I wish I was still dreaming sometimes

Life is full of...
whatever you fill it with

My past was incredibly...?
two sided

I get annoyed when...
my headphones break

Parties are...
a bit too much effort with a bit too little motivation to be social

Kisses are the worst when...
they're not with you

Tommorrow I'm going to...
breath in air like a fresh drink of water

I really want...
to figure out what I'm looking for

I have low tolerance for people who...
don't speak their minds

If I had a million dollars...
I would use it to change the world through music</FONT>"

Sure, she's great, she's encouraging, for the twentysomething hours a month she's around.

I don't understand how you can ""love us so much and miss us so much"" when you make a decision to move half a goddamn city away. 

I miss you, damnit.

I just want my mom back...</FONT>"

You said you have half a heart, too.

At least I've been chasing after something.

I find it funny how the most meaningful things you can hear are the things that nobody will ever remember.</FONT>"

Hey, world.

One month and six days till March fucking 27th.

Six more days and it will have been eleven months since I cut.

If I can do this then I can do anything.</FONT>"

No more badtalk or anything. Ever. About anyone.

From now on, I take back anything I ever said about anybody and I'm only going to say positive things from now on.

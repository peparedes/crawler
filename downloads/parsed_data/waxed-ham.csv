"event","Went up to the Beachcomber last night (Saturday). Pretty cool place really, lots of space, kind of a bit like Woodies but with a lake instead of a shitty creek and grass instead of a boardwalk.

Pete drove Keegan, Erin, myself and Kate up and they had a few drinks. Keegan didn't fare too well with the Guiness he had and was looking pretty seedy on the way home.

Talked to him about moving out and he said Erin (his gf who's currently in Europe, also I'm not sure they're on good terms) might be interested in moving out with him. I get a feeling it might be a bad idea. So many things could get fucked up and I'm not sure I'm okay with the idea of moving out with a couple. But if they don't move out together then I think the chance of Keegan moving out would probably decrease quite a bit. Ah well. See how things go.

The Beachcomber would be pretty awesome place to hang out if it wasn't so far away, but at least I can say I've been."

"event","Well finished all uni classes for this semester and hopefully forever. Got a DVD Burner today and that was exciting. Annoying to because courier dude took his time to deliver.

Went to the beach at Terrigal and fuck the water was cold. Went to the beery and had a beer then went home. Should be plenty more beach days over the summer and hopefully might get a bit less white. Plans are afoot to smuggle beer and other booze onto the beach as it's an alcohol free zone. I can see lots of BBQ's coming up too.

Other:
Burnt some shit for Pete. Annoyed because other blog hosting is down."

"event","Well I feel drawn or obligated to do something with this journal. Although I don't know what I want to put here. I had an idea that maybe I should ask people they want to see or what I should put here. Who knows if anyone even sees this crap. I also should be doing uni work at this point in time anyway so blah."

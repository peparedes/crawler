"event","Sometimes i wish i could go back to the past to fix all my mistakes , and i would never make any mistake again . But life is so complicated . U cant do wat u want to . U cant change wat it was . U hav nothing to do with that . Sometimes when somebody's by ur side , u dont even wanna talk to them or seeing them . But when they really leave u , u 'll realize that somewhere in ur heart hurts so bad . And u just dont wanna let them go of u . U just wanna hold them in ur arms and say that how much they mean to u . And u wanna apologize about the mean things u did to them so far . Thats exactly how i feel right now . I 'm so tired . I dont wanna let that one go of me . I'll miss that one a lot ....!!! I never know that i hav this kind of feeling ........Plz forgive me the mean things i did to u , i'll miss u a lot and never forget u .....................!!!"

"event","Today i'm kind of sick and tired . But its not too bad though . Maybe i'm crazy , but its like i like to be sick . 'Cuz everytime i'm sick , it brings back to me some good memories ....Right now i feel so confused about everything . I dont know why , like i got the feelings with J , but all the time i try to be really cold with J . And it makes J sad sometimes . And J thinks that i hate J ... I just act the opposite way . How stupid i am ! Anyways , everything's just confusing right now ...."

Marlena- I am sorry I didn't get a chance to tell you goodbye. I love you with all my heart....

"event","Been a while since I posted. I have been very busy with work, and spending time with Doc. 
I think things are going well between us....

Working on a new investigation... There was a car accident a few weeks ago involving Nikki and Vivian Alamain... both are in critical condition. Ivan was driving, but seems to have escaped any injuries. Interestingly enough, there is still no clues as to howq this car accident even happened. I need to speak with Vivian or Nikki, preferably both, to get their statements...but I have to wait. At least, that's what the doctors are telling me.And of course, Ivan is in a state of shock right now so he's no use...  So, in the meantime.....I am working LONG hours to investigate this, and I'm coming up with nothing.... *sigh* 

Well, I've got to be going. I just thought I'd let the world know I am still alive. To the rest of you salemites out there....let's pray for Vivian and Nikki and their speedy recovery...

"event","Oh what a day.

Well, my son is in the hospital right now, as well as Brady Black and Billie Reed. I'll be on my way shortly to visit with them.

I am so angry with Kate, I could kill her. Today was her trial for trying to murder my daughter. I had an emergency at the station, and on my way back to the courthouse, I got caught in a traffic jam.

When I got back, there was complete and utter chaos. I guess Kate went a little crazy. She was going to shoot mjy daughter, but apparently Billie, eric, and Brady walked in and freaked her out. She shot all three of them. Eric was shot in the leg, Brady was shot in the buttocks, and Billie was shot in her stomach. Billie isn't doing so well right now. She was unconcious when they rushed her to the ER, and I'm hoping she'll turn out alright. I can't believe Kate would do this to two of my children now, and her own daughter. This is incredibly sad to me. 

She'll regret it, and I'll make sure of that.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go visit with my son, Billie and Brady. 


Always
Roman

ps- Marlena, if you read this, I'd like to see you soon for a family dinner... I need you right now."

I'm sitting here, still wondering if everything that just happened was a nightmare. 

I did it. I arrested Kate for trying to murder my daughter. I can't believe she'd do that. Didn't our marriage mean anything to her? I can't get my head around this. She obviously never even had amnesia...just like I was warned. How could she do this to us? I trusted her. I almost lost my daughter because I put my heart on the line for Kate, and this is how she repays me?

I think the only answer is for me to divorce her. I can't stay married to a woman who...would try to kill Sami.... 

I need to think.... 

good night..

"event","Not too much more going on. I got to see Sami and Eric, and Carrie. I think Sami and I are going to be fine... and I have a surprise for her, but it might be a while before she finds out what it is.

Eric and I had a nice long visit also.

I am so proud of all my children. They've done so well for themselves.

I really need to start working on this case with Bo, involving Hope missing. I think I'll talk to some of the people that saw her last... 

**PRIVATE ENTRY*
I've made a decision regarding Kate. It was a very hard decision for me to make, but after hearing about her poisoning Sami, I don't think I can be married to her anymore. So I've decided to leave her, as soon as she gets her memory back...

It's killing me inside because I thought I could trust her. And I still love her, but knowing what she's done to my daughter...to Lucas and Will, and the rest of the family... I can't do it... 

**END OF PRIVATE ENTRY**

Always,
Roman"

"event","Well this is wonderful. I just found out a bunch of stuff that I didn't want to know, and have no idea how to deal with.

Kate poisoned Sami. How do I deal with that? How can I lecture, yell...whatever I'm going to do...at a sick woman with amnesia? 

On top of that, I really have to fix things with Sami. I can't believe what a lousy father I've been. Sami, when is a good time to get together? I <b> will </b> call you sweetie. I promise. Tomorrow morning....

Hope is missing... I guess I have my work cut out for me...

"event","Well I am so sorry it has taken me THIS long to make one of these live journals that everyone seems to have.

I have been really busy taking care of Kate because of the state she's in. She has amnesia and she's just not doing well right now. 

So that's all I have for now.. I will hopefully have more updates here soon.

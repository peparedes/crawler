"event","Well here I am at 10 at night listening to Coldplay, Dashboard, and Radiohead. Ahh very soothing in a way. I really wanted to go out tonight kind of to get away from the fam. I am very easily aggrivated right now so i have secluded myself to listen to music. (another side effect of the emo mood) Hmm anyways i've decided i want school to start. I'm tired of it looming over me, and i want to see all of my friends. 
     I also need to hang out with sarah, and go to starbucks which is usually part of hanging out with sarah."

"event","Ok Today has been pretty eventful in this little teenagers life. First of all i was on worship team today for the first time. I did vocals. It was pretty awesome! Then i had to figure out when lauras party was today, so i had to go buy her a present. And i went to the mall and i actually went into...abercrombie and fitch... *hangs head in shame*. AND BOUGHT SOMETHING!!!! AHH i'm turning into such a preppy girly girl. ITs really starting to freak me out. Hey maybe oneday this will happen to brengan! (mallory that is) Its scary stuff. Anyways i figured out they had tall clothes. So it basically went down like this...
      I walk into the mall with my father i see abercrombie and fitch and think to myself hey maybe they have some school clothes there. So i walk in and the music is pounding i feel so awquard and out of place and kind of freaked out. I walk around look for pants i see my size and in tall thinks... hmm maybe this isnt sooo bad. still feeling quite out of place i continue looking around. and then i turn around and i see megan (who works there) and emily peale and another person and they see me and megan is like TARYN you are actually in my store!! and i'm like yeah its really quite odd for me to be in here and yeah we talked and i think my dad started to go insaine because of the loud obnoxious music. So i wound up buying a pair of pants and a polo. wow that store takes a lot out of you and its outragiously expensive. I dont know whether i should be pround i survived going into abercrombie or be ashamed that i went into abercrombie. I just... dont know.
      Then i went to bath and body works and bought something for laura. We spent a total of about 45 minutes at the mall. I think thats a record. well thats all for now."

But anyways i checked out Xanga its cool and all its just a little to complicated for my tastes. And i figure why do Xanga if i already have this thing. I mean xanga is cool and all if you have a lot of time on your hands to play with it and figure it out and stuff. This suits me thanks
   I've been organizing my stuff for school and i have been putting stuff in my new closet. (new as in just built) And i am putting all my clothes in there its so nice and organized i think i might actually be able to live in my real room before school starts! I havent been in there since the chorus trip last year so like aprilish. That would be awesome. OOh and our bathrooms will be done soon. I am so Excited about that. ITs gonna be awesome to have a shower again. Woo! 
   Watched the olympics tonight the swimming was cool, the synchronized diving was awesome. i like that sort of thing. i guess i am sort of a olympics nerd. I love it!"

Mission trip i got ferociously ill and v-ball camp was awesome aside from that girl dying. That was awful, she was fine and then 24 hours later she was gone. What a terrible thing to happen, it just made me realize how sort notice death can be and how we should live each day as it could be our last. anyways v-ball camp was awesome i played setter for a while because both of our setters got hurt. It makes me apreciate them all the more. I have been working kiff each day from 1230 to 4 and then doing v-ball from 6 to 830 ooh thats been HELL. i am so sore, we are doing these new crazy ankle workouts so we dont hurt our ankles as much i think that i am going to sprain an ankle trying to do the workouts. and we started shoulder workouts too. i am getting way better and stronger though. i still have to read most of my required reading though i have only read 2 chapters of a tale of two cities its SO dull. well i am going to bed i am exsausted again."

So in the mall sarah made me take the stairs everywhere, because i'm in training for v-ball, but then she would take the escalator and laugh at me from it! Oh yes i forgot to write about me starting running, oh it was awful like the first couple times well its still awful but not as hard anymore, so i run the days i dont do the leg circut workout. So i run 2 and a half miles (to the lafayette shores sign and back) So yeah. So sarah and i went to the mall then we went to botanical gardens and walked around where she runs and we looked at all the ""tree houses"" they really arent in trees they are around trees. totally false advertizing, jeez. Then we went to doumars for yet another coke (our first was at the mall)then we went to my house and looked at a few pictures from my middle school years (eww) Then sarah went home, and i hung around until v-ball open gym, which i wound up convincing sarah to go to open gym, wow i totally forgot how to even play volleyball, and it was like 7 norfolk christian kids and like 20 of coach overmans league and they were old and kind of scary and they beat the crap out of us! i think i have improved since last season and i did a LOT of falling over, those bruises will last a long time. Then sarah took me home and we listened to reliant K, i am sad she wont be playing next year I'm glad she'll be coaching next year, i hope she goes to camp with us."

Its like oh lets make all the kids who are smart and talented look really smart and talented and make them feel really good about them selves and  make the dumb kids feel really dumb and unimportant.  YAH! So me and chad sit there and watch Matthew balderston and lisz prior get thousands of awards, and then watch Leah Allison and Ellen get awards and then whoever are the smart kids in lower grades get awards, and then they hand out the really dumb awards that we get like i nearly froze to death in mrs peppers class award! yes! just what i've been going for all year! Ok so anyways then we watched the senior slide show, and that was cute and then kind of sad. Then i went to emilys house, i had fun there i watched a bootlegged copy of shrek 2 and stuff. i helped emily pack for camp, she's leaving for 2 months well she's probably already gone. Sad. Then we went to graduation we sang, i learned mrs ewans is pregnant, i nearly strangled christina a few times, then we watched graduation i sad near ellen and she and i nearly cried a few times, good thing i brought tissues. It was really sad to see all of my friends graduate it hasnt really hit me that they wont be there next year. then we hung around and talked to every one (i just realized i refer to myself as we a lot) anyways then then sarah drove me home an talked about how i couldnt believe i was a senior and she was a graduate, i still cant believe it. Quite sad, next year i'll be leaving everyone. I'm glad that sarah is sticking around or else it would have been really really sad. well got to go"

Why am i surprised at this, i shouldnt be. Why did i think that he would ask me over beautiful smart ellen. Or why am i even kidding myself that someone will even ask me? This is a fruitless activity, but still i would like someone to ask me. I am not sure who though. I'll probably wind up going by myself because stephanie will probably bail on me. 
 On the way home from school I saw a wreak on the side of the road and i thought wow i hope that isnt sarahs car (because it looked like it) , lo and behold there is sarah standing on the side of the road on a cell phone. I hope she is ok
And why is it when i am feeling sad, or have a terrible day and people ask how i am i always say fine. I really wish i had a stephanie here to when i say fine she says Bullshit what happened. I guess i dont want to heap my problems on other people. it seems kind of rude.
  I forgot a lunch today and i am now eating a pb and j sandwich with some milk. i also forgot to turn in my community service hours.

  Well Friday was the big chemistry test. It was awful, the last problem, i talked to like 5 people and i havent yet found someone with answers remotly close to mine or to anyone elses. Someone had -14, another 51, another 3003, i had 509, I hope my answer was right! Friday was Also The last day of lower school sports club, Hurrah! I dont have to teach those children of satan, volleyball anymore! i mean wonderful children. I played with my team this time because we were missing someone. But i am so used to diving on the floor when a ball is missed and is about to hit the floor. SO i do it as a reaction, And i did it and in mid air i was thinking, hmm i am not wearing any knee pads this is going to hurt, It did. But i wound up doing that about 3 or 4 times. so i have a few bruises. Austin Asked leah to ""junior-senior"" on friday. So thats nice, maybe some of the  guys will get a move on and start asking people.
  Saturday i went and saw the secret window with Kristin, it was pretty good, but whoa weird plot twist. Never would have seen that coming. I aslo went to carters house and we worked on making invitations for ""junior-senior"" aka Prom, We have not finished them yet but thats happening today, Prom is going to be awesome, i really hope that someone asks me, yeah that would be nice. Oh i also got my hair  cut on saturday, that was exciting, wooo.
  Today, Sunday, I have come to the conclution, as a result of this online journal, that my life is really boring. Quite boring in fact. WEll at least it is not full of much drama, or lots of stress where i would be at a breaking point, no i am quite sure that will coming very soon tho, very soon. Ahh but alas tomorrow is monday, That is sad. But it will be great to be around friends, school would be much better if there were no tests, or grades, but this is not so.

I had to tell people what a quarter note was a couple weeks ago. We are singing this awful song called banquet fuege, it basically consists of words like gobble chomp munch slurp, and there is a fly in my soup. it sounds discusting.

 Today We found out who is rooming with us on the gettysburg trip. I am rooming with Morgan Christy and Jessica. Christy was like ugh we are going have to hear about scott the whole time, which might possibly be very true. We had a laugh about that, but i think it will be fun with the four of us, even though none of us ever hang out together out side of school. 
 The invitations and party favors committee met today, and we started assembling the invitations and wound up ruining about 4 of them. We are nowhere near finishing them. I dont see why people call it ""junior senior"" just call it what it is people, its called prom. 
 Today in art we found out that our next piece is a clay sculpture, a very large clay sculpture big enough to fill the large Kiln. I am not a big fan of clay and i have a feeling that my piece is going to explode and break the kiln. I have no idea what i want to make. However the project after that is our last project, and we can use any medium, i think i want to make a stained glass window or a stained glass lamp, because i have never made one before, So that might be fun."

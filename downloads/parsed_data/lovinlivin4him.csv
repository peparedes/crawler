Anyway, next Finals week (Spring) will be my last undergrad finals week...crazy...kinda weird...but I'm working on that. No really, I'm checkin' out grad schools...soon to choose where to apply to.</P>
<P>So yeah, I just learned I got a 74 on my Spanish final...not the grade I wanted, but apparently I still got a B in the class and the teacher thought I was ""a really good student"" in her email. That's kinda cool. So I'm going to get to move on to my LAST spanish class next semester! I finished my Western Culture Hieritage class 3303 today....last one of three. That was nice to do. Well, I got a final this afternoon to study for...and I'm not sure anyone reads my journal anymore since I rearly post...lol Laterz!</P>"

<P><FONT color=#33ff33>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going ok. Not sure if it's allergies or a cold...either way I'm trying to get over it. So I'll keep this short and brief so I can go to bed! :-D School's almost over...only about a month left. That's crazy, especially when I realize I've only got one more semester before I graduate and move on to more school...At least it'll be grad school though. But, I'm not sure where I'm going to go. I need to make some decisions...soon. I also need to sit down and study math and all that so I can Retake the GRE and hopefully not bomb it this time...it wasn't horrible...well, ok, the math part was horrible. BUT, I got a respectable grade on my essay...apparently it made sense, but had a some 'errors' in it. </FONT></P>

"event","Ah yes....staying busy and yet it seems like I'm not doing much sometimes. This is the dilemma I deal with occasionally...(usually when I'm sitting at home or at school, contemplating what school work I should be doing.) Anyway, so I almost had a heart-attack before class today when my classmate asked me if I'd studied for spanish class, something about a test.!. Well, no I had not...I didn't even go to class last Thursday...so I had missed the announcement. BUT, turns out it was just a practice exam and wasn't graded. Which came to my relief. And now, I know what to study for for the real thing this Thursday! Looks like I'll be up late most day's this week. I need a good grade in spanish...since I kinda bombed the first test."

Oh, that's right, LIFE happened, in that I mean school, work, family, friends, IV, etc. etc. Well, quick update(s):<br>
My car is running, not great, still needs lots of work. Definitely a
point A point B car now. But I'm worried that might not be the case if
I don't get to working on it soon!<br>
School is keeping me busy. I've had at least one test in each of my 4
classes. I've done well, and poorly, on them. Spanish sucked because I
didn't really study and then I had a total mental retreival&nbsp;
breakdown and could not remember the endings to one of the
tenses...yeah, that's not a good thing.<br>
Work is just as normal as ever, I guess. Although Medicaid just changed
(as of 10/01/2005) their policy for those 21 years of age and
older...they can now get glasses and exams every 24 months(just in case
you were wondering).<br>
Intervarsity has been awesome lately! We just got back from our weekend
get-away (The Great Escape). I played with the Worship Team during the
weekend and that was a good experience. The speaker, Don Everts, was
awesome as well! I'll have to fill in about this some more later.<br>
And Last but by far NOT LEAST, my relationship with Christin is going
well....8 months to the day! (yeah, that's 4 months shy of a year... ;-)<br>
Anywayz, I got to run. I'll add more laterz!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

I haven't posted any of the pics of my car...if I were not at school, I'd do it now, but you'll have to wait some more. ;-) Anyway, so what has everyone been up to? Me lots of stuff.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>Ok here's another brief update from before school started. I had summer school all of July, that went well! Considering I missed the ENTIRE first week of it. Yeah, I thought I was dead...dropped, or would be, from the class, missed the Drop with a W date, Missed the Refund withdrawal date, and of course, an entire week(5 2.4 hour days) of class. BUT, I was very blessed and I jumped right in and ended up getting an A, IN SPANISH of all classes!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>Well, after that I was free to work full time. Which was nice. I started saving so I could essentially be in a position to pay off my credit card&nbsp;a little way into the semester, even WITH school expenses. BUT, alas, my driving 'crashed' that hope. I think it was God saying 'HEY, STOP BEING A BAD DRIVER!' I can admit it, I haven't been using Good habits lately. <FONT color=#ffff00>Talking and Texting on the phone while driving are a few of the bad habits</FONT>. Well,&nbsp;in case you're wondering, it is rather difficult to correct for a skid/fish-tail with a phone in your hand. Also, <FONT color=#ffff00>DON'T STEP ON THE BRAKE WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SKID</FONT>! I knew that...but I wasn't THINKING about what I was doing and did it anyway. SO, I swerved to the right, realized my mistake, steered into the skip (turned the wheels right, WITH ONE HAND) until the wheels got traction again. THEN IT GOT ""FUN"". <FONT color=#ffff00>My car when from sliding sideways to the right, to an ALMOST entire 360 degrees to the left when the front wheels got traction but I couldn't straighten them </FONT>out BECAUSE I ONLY HAD ONE HAND ON THE WHEEL. you'd think I'd have been shaken or stirred or something after all the excitement. But NO, I just found myself sitting on the curb thinking, </FONT><FONT color=#ffff00>'DANG, I knew better than that'.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>Anyway, just for the fun of it I'm gonna draw my accident out for ya! And then post it for ALL to see. I'm lucky not to have been injured or to have injured anyone else in my carelessness. And I'm very Thankful for that! Thank You God!</FONT></STRONG></P>

I've posted anything. Well, I've got a few spare minutes between
classes here and I figured I'd BRIEF you on all that's happening. So
here goes:<br>
1)I'm back at utep for my final two semesters (graduate in May) and doing stuff that graduation entails.<br>
2)I'm officially part of the Servant(Leadership) Team for Intervarsity
Christian Fellowship UTEP Chapter. My official title is Treasurer. But
as anyone who's done Leadership in IV before knows, there's a lot more
to it that just doing your job.<br>
3) Still working, though I've recently gotten a raise and am very happy
about that! Only get about 18 hours a week, but hopefully with the
raise I'll be able to pay for my gas!<br>
4)Which reminds me, I'm still working, yes fixing, my car after my late
afternoon 'slide' down Timberwolf and into the curb. There is much more
to that story but that'll have to wait. I'll post pics up soon to show
just what I did to my poor car. :-(<br>
5) Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST, I'm still very much enjoying spending
lots of time with my girlfriend Christin! I Love You! We're doing well.
It'll be 7 months that we've been a couple in a few days.<br>
Well, I suppose that's about all I really have time to post. So let
that suffice until next time, which hopefully won't be quite so long
from now! Laterz peoplez<br>

<P>God is truelly an awesome God! This last weekend my brother Chris had a 'fundraiser' for his missions trip to Kenya! (Man it's weird to think of Chris being in Africa!! That's cool!!!) Anyway, Chris had not done any money raising until this weekend. We, our immediate family, served lunch to our church congregation and other family and friends. Chris needed roughly $3,000+ for his trip. That's a LOT of money, mony my family doesn't have to give to him. Well, the people at Zion Evangelical Lutheran (LCMS)&nbsp;responded, BIG! Over $2,000 BIG!!! There is no question that Chris will get the rest of the money he needs to go on this missions trip! Thank you God! Nothing is impossible in you!</P>"

"event","Hey everyone. Hope all is going well for you. I'm doing pretty well. I have a few things I've really got to work on to get done. But otherwise things are going pretty well! Although, I'm gonna be looking for other things to do at the end of the week (probably occupy myself with homework) because that beautiful girl who is my girlfriend is taking a trip to visit a good friend of hers. So yeah, my usual schedule...sleep, school, work, spend time with mi novia, eat with mi novia, sleep (not with mi novia), call mi novia, school, spend time with mi novia...isn't going to be the same this week. Wow, the more I think about...we really do spend a lot of time together! :-D Anyways, Hope everyone is getting along alright. Catch ya laterz."

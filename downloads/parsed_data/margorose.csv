"event","Our bellydance troupe has a big performance on Saturday, and stress levels are running high. Last night we had a total meltdown of a bitchfest. I'm talking 50 year old women throwing tantrums, announcing they're taking their toys and going home, my friend who never ever cries sobbing all the way home, and a flurry of bitching emails today. 

But an email my friend sent out saying that we all ought to sit down and have a respectful meeting about it tonight has been met with dead silence. 

If we had ever once, in the four year history of the troupe, had such a meeting, things wouldn't have come to this pass. But no, they can't talk about it face to face, because that would be Conflict! And Confrontational! And we can't have that. Far better to whine about things behind one another's backs and let it get to the boiling point."

"event","I started therapy three years ago with three goals:  To figure out what I wanted to do about my marriage, to get my eating under control, and to improve my time management. 

The marriage has ended very amicably. We're not close friends the way I expected to be,  but that's because the same reasons for which I didn't want him as a husband make him not appropriate friend material.  But we do a good job of parenting, and can be friendly when we see each other. 

 I've lost close to 50 pounds. The ADD meds have made all the difference.  At first I thought it was because Adderall is amphetamine based, but further research has told me that constant eating is a symptom of ADD.

I have a performance on Saturday, and the costume is completely done.  The bellydance pattern line project is a few months off track, not years like my other pattern projects, and some of that is due to other people's vacations and such.  It's looking like they'll be on the market by April or May. I still need to work on setting myself daily and weekly schedules, but I have the tools to do it.

So my therapist and I are tentatively going to have our last appointment next week.  It's a little scary, but I'm ready.  I might go back someday, but after three years of hard work, it's time to take a break.

That creative window that's always running in my brain is kicking around ideas for something to make for her.  I am so grateful for her expertise.  I've had a lot of strokes of luck in my life,  and finding her on my first phone call was one of the great ones."

"event","Despite my discontent, I came away from the weekend reminded how much I love to teach, how good it is for my other work,  and how good I am at it.  I'd like to do more, and ideally, I'd like to make enough money at it that I don't feel badly that it takes time away from other work.  So I'm kicking around some ideas, and I'd love feedback as to which, if any of them, sound like things you or your friends would like to attend/be willing to pay for, and contacts for places or organizations that might be interested.

1.  The Margo's Patterns Retreat:  We meet at some relaxing spot, like a hotel or bed and breakfast, and spend a weekend sewing.  Mirrors, cutting tables, and ironing boards will be provided;  you bring (or ship ahead) your sewing machine, tools, and fabric.  I'll be there to answer questions, help fit, and schmooze.   If this one's successful, we could eventually make it an annual week long event.

2.  Weekend Workshops.  An intensive two day workshop on making a specific garment.  The one we get asked for most is the Elizabethan corset, but many others are possible. Materials kit would be provided. Again, we provide mirrors, cutting tables, and ironing boards, you bring sewing machine and tools.  We'd provide continental breakfasts, coffee, tea, soft drinks, and snacks. 

Speaking and Lectures:  A number of topics, including various aspects of 16th century costume,  bellydance costume, Beyond Home Sewing: Tips and Tricks from Industry, History, and Theater.  I'm also working on talks and workshops on body acceptance and self esteem for larger women and teens.   Can range from one hour to day long (with breaks, of course!)

feedback is very welcome!"

"event","Yes, I know, It's been a long time.  I joined the exodus to Facebook, it being more conducive to quick posts.  What it doesn't offer is a venue for longer, thoughtful posts, so I'm going to start writing them here instead.

For those of you who don't follow along on Facebook, here's a quick recap of the last six months:

Weight loss is going very well, I'm down 45 pounds.  

My health is better.  Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lyme disease tests were negative.  I still think the joint pain is some kind of autoimmune problem, but all I can do about it is try to improve my general health.  That's a bit challenging because the joint pain flares up if I exercise too much, and also if I exercise too little.  I'm still working on finding out how much I should be doing.  

I did turn out to have some osteoarthritis in my left knee, so my doctor sent me to physical therapy, which I found very informative.  I got a great PT who didn't flog me for my weight at all, in fact she said any dancer over 50 was going to have knee issues, and helped me find ways I could strengthen my muscles to help. She said I was the strongest and most flexible person of my weight she'd ever seen! I now have almost no pain in my knee at all.

Dancing has been limited because of the knee issue, but I've continued to go to class and do what I could.  We're going to dance at Rakassah,  and I'll be in the chorus line and come out for one slow number, as I don't want to risk hurting the knee by going back to dancing full out too soon.

Doug is looking for work.  we're waiting to hear on the job he interviewed for last week.  If he gets it, he'll rent a room in Sonoma county and come back here on weekends, and the boys and I will move down to join him after the school year is done.

Rob had a hearing test and it turned out he has moderate hearing loss of a genetic nature.  He has hearing aids and is doing well with them.  I think I may have the same thing, but will wait to get tested till our financial situation is better, since my insurance doesn't pay for hearing aids for adults.

James has a girlfriend.  This is a brand new development and I haven't met her yet, but my ""mole"" (My intern from last year) tells me she's the nicest, sweetest girl in the school.  Whew!  

The Tudor Lady's wardrobe pattern is selling nicely.  I'm working out a new order of work for the big packages that I think will create better products and be less stressful.

The Dancewear patterns are being developed, we're at the stage of fitting samples of the base patterns.  It sure is easier to write instructions for a single garment, that take three to four pages.

I think those are the highlights of the last six months or so.  It's good to be back!"

So I'm making the kirtle bodice. It has a layer of coutile backed with calico, stitched with channels for cable tie bones, with a layer of cotton flannel over that to pad out the bones and conceal them, the fashion fabric, (a slubby cotton in heathery rust and black), the band trimming the upper edge of the bodice, and a heavy cotton-linen lining. 

I sewed all the layers together to bag them out, trimmed them close, and turned--to discover that I put the layers in the wrong order and the flannel is where the lining should be.  I don't want little teddy bears in nightshirts showing, even on the inside of my clothes, so I'm going to have to pick it all apart, and either caaaarefully bag a new lining without fraying all these edges to nothing, or give up and flat line it and bias bind the edge.

<i>Hello, everyone!

I'm writing to let you know that I have decided that this year, I'm cutting back on gifting.  In fact, I'm only giving presents to the boys this year, and even they have been warned that I'm scaling way back.

This is not an economic decision.  It's because I've made some profound changes in my life, and I want to be consistent with them.

I estimate that this year, I gave and threw away almost 40 CUBIC YARDS of unwanted stuff, in addition to two cars (and a husband).  The clutter was toxic for me in many ways, and getting rid of it was a major turning point in my life.  Given that, I find myself reluctant to add more stuff to my life or anyone else's.  I also want to get away from the pressure to give because of societal expectations rather than because I happened upon the perfect gift for someone

I love all of you and value having you in my life.  If you need me, I'm here for you.  But this year,  know that I'm giving my love unattached to tangible objects, and feel free to do so yourselves.

Happy Holidays,

Margo</i>

The response has been overwhelmingly positive. My mother said the best present she got this year was not having to buy presents! She'd already bought my sister and me some small things, so she dumped them in the Women's Shelter donation bin and took the rest of the money she'd earmarked for gifts and put it in the Salvation Army kettle. Happy Holidays to all!"

  I was way overdressed.  I wore my Tudor gown, which seemed appropriate;  after all, it's a PARADE! So I figured fancy was good.

I should probably make some Elizabethan and Tudor lower class clothes to wear to events, so I look like my products, but I think I also need to have some very loose, cool things without too many layers.

Not so pleasantly, I was troubled by insomnia for several days.  This is not good for people with Bipolar II, because it can trigger a hypomanic episode.  I stopped needing my sleep meds when he changed my dosage of another med a few months ago, and hadn't refilled  them.So Saturday, after the 3rd straight night with no more than four hours sleep, I made a call to my shrink's office line, which usually has a phone number where you can reach him to discuss medication issues, only to find that he'd signed off for the weekend leaving a number for his backup . Which was WRONG.  Luckily, I was able to talk the pharmacist into giving me a few to tide me over till Monday, but the damage was done, and been weepy and irritable for the past few days.

"event","Thank God For Ducks Day started in 1976  in South Lake Tahoe.  A group of friends from the Placerville area had moved there because there were easily obtainable entry level jobs, mostly in casinos. The jobs were attainable because they sucked.  Among their sucky qualities was the fact that no one had Thanksgiving Day off.  So, they decided to have a feast the next day, but when they got to the store, they discovered that there were no turkeys on the day after Thanksiving...but there were ducks.

Ducks Day has been celebrated for all but one of the subsequent 31 years.  It's been hosted by whoever wants to.  Sometimes, when no one's up for hosting, we go to a Chinese restaurant for Peking Duck. 

Taditionally, whoever's hosting invites her or his newer friends.  Guests are welcome to bring friends.  Some of these people enjoy Ducks Day so much that they keep coming long after the original connection has faded away.

This year, I'll be hosting Duck's Day.  If you'd like to come, and you can convince me that you're not a psychotic stalker, let me know and I'l send you an Evite."

It's a princess line halter V-neck, with a flared skirt and train. The fabric is iridescent pale ivory silk duppioni. We bought a sheer ivory fabric with a border and floral motifs embroidered in ivory and metallic gold, and cut the border and the flowers out and appliqued them onto the dress. It looks like they were embroidered on the silk. I bought a hot fix wand and used it to stick a tiny blue rhinestone in the middle of each flower. 

The headpiece is a small comb topped with the same embroidered flowers, stiffened and stitched to be three dimensional. It has a detachable ivory shimmer tulle veil, with a sprinkling of the blue rhinestones. 

That description makes it sound gaudy, but it's not, it's very subtle and classy looking. The wedding is Saturday, so I'll have pictures next week. 

Now I have to do the finishing clean, press, and stuff.  I clean any spots and smudges with a toothbrush and Ivory soap, go over every square inch of it and clip any threads, and press it.  I don't like to use a steamer on silk, because it stretches so easily.  Then I stuff the bodice with tissue paper to keep the shape, and wrap it in a sheet or plastic to keep it pristine.

I've enjoyed doing this one so much that I'm tempted to get back into the business.  I could do one dress every month or so...and adding a grand or more a month to my income sounds pretty sweet.

That's assuming that the economy leaves anyone with that kind of $ to spend on wedding duds, of course."

The PA at my doctor's office recommended that I try eliminating various things from my diet to see if it helps.  So I did.  And wouldn't you know, my worst fears came true.

Yep.  Caffeine. I mixed one part caffeinated with two parts decaf, and drank my usual amounts for a week.  the pain didn't completely disappear, but it was much better. Then I fell off the wagon and had three cups of high test.  by that night, I could barely move my hands.

So, after thirty years as a coffee person, I have to quit.  I've cut it down to 1/4 caffeinated, and next week I'll go cold turkey.  If I snarl or burst into tears when you talk to me, or fall asleep in mid conversation, you'll know why."

The sewing room is fabulous.  It's actually a dining room, and has a half wall between it and the foyer.  On the other side of the foyer is an open arch into the formal living room, which we're using as the office, so Doug and I can talk while he's working and I'm sewing.  Another wall of the dining room is an open arch into the kitchen/family room, so I can talk to the boys, and keep an eye on cooking.  

I think I've sewn more in the last month than I did in a year in the old place.  So far I've made a summer dress, a test version of the Irish leine, a strip pieced and embellished tribal bellydance belt, and a set of lined curtains.  Next in line is a really fun project;  my friend Beth is getting married! So I'm making a glamourous halter necked dress is ivory dupionni. We're going to test the pattern first in a cotton print, which we'll  cut shorter so she can wear it as a summer dress.

While I love the kitchen, too, I'll probably be more interested in cooking when it's not blistering hot out.  I am having fun playing with Doug's uber barbecue grill, though.  

But the very best thing about my new house is sharing it with someone who wants to be an equal partner in making it a home."

"event","Last week, I ran into my high school drama teacher, who I hadn't seen in close to thirty years.

He was the coolest, most popular teacher at our school, and I did everything I could to gain his approval.  Unfortunately, in his view,  I was guilty of the worst crime a young woman can commit:  I wasn't fuckable. 

I'm  not saying he would have gone for it if I had been up to his standards (although there certainly were rumors)  but it obviously rankled. How dare I be female and not make myself attractive to him?  Of course he was justified in mocking me in front of the class;  I was not only not desirable, I had a mind and opinions of my own! What was WRONG with me?  Why didn't I take his advice and become ""the kind of girl boys will like"" by (a) putting myself on a starvation regime and (b) stopping acting so smart?

Once he realized he wasn't going to get through to me, he dismissed me completely.  I was a nonperson. My performing abilities didn't count.  I wasn't cast in his plays because I didn't look right onstage.  My early interest in costume design didn't mean a thing to him.  His focus went to other students who looked and acted the way he wanted them to.

So I was on my way out of Wal-Mart and I spotted him going in.  I called out to him, and told him who I was.  And he did the eye crawl over my body and I saw the blinders slam down.

He asked, perfunctorily, what I was doing these days.  I told him, ""I got into costume design, and performing at Renaissance Faires, and now I have a pattern company and people all over the world buy my patterns. ""  And you know, I don't think he heard a word.  A little more polite chat and he was off.

The man taught high school drama for twenty years, and as far as I've heard, the only one of his students who went into a drama related profession, made a living at it, and became well known in the field, was me.  I'm his greatest success story.

And he couldn't let himself see me."

"event","Although we won't actually be moving in until the 14th, I've decided to move all the sewing stuff into the new house this weekend.  It'll free up some space in the garage and in my room that can then be sued as staging areas for the big move.

So I'm pondering what to do with the space.  Here's a picture: <lj-cut> 
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/margorose/pic/0000k29z/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/margorose/pic/0000k29z/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""212"" border='0'/></a>

It's actually a dining room.  That's a half wall between it and the foyer, and the office will be in the room on the opposite side.  You're looking in through an archway that faces the kitchen/family room.  It's 11x11.

While I've been lucky enough to have had dedicated sewing spaces for most of the last 20 years, I've never had one that was pretty before.  I want to do it justice, which means doing better than the industrial metal shelving and mishmosh of furniture that I've worked with before.

I don't really want fancy built in cabinetry, even if I could afford it.  A few years back I bought a large L-shaped computer desk to hold my serger and sewing machine, but it took up too much room and wasn't flexible enough. I  want to be able to reconfigure the room so that if I'm sewing something huge I can put a table behind the machine to support it, or so that I can have one or two other people sewing in there with me.  For some projects I need a big cutting table:  for others I need to move things around.

I have two extremely nifty metal drawer units, desk height, that currently house my threads and sewing tools, with a table top over them to make a 6' desk.  I think I'll keep that as a crafting and hand sewing space.  I plan to get two of <a href=""http://www.sewingmachinesplus.com/horn-33.php"">these</a> to hold the portable machine and the serger, that way I can move them around easily or even fold them up and stash them should I need to.

I have a large folding cutting table, but it needs some repairs.  In the meantime I've been using a banquet table with PVC pipe extensions on the legs.  I also have an artist's taboret  that holds my rulers, pins, chalk, and other marking tools as I'm cutting.

Most of my fabric is going to be stored elsewhere in the house, but I still have a lot of stuff that needs to be accessible.  Since I can't afford to buy or make new shelving at present, I'm going to use my ugly black metal industrial shelves by making cozies for them, as seen <a href=""http://www.cottageliving.com/cottage/homes/article/0,21135,1150860,00.html"">here.</a>
I'm going to go to Ross tomorrow and see if I can find a couple sets of bedsheets in a pretty print with fancy borders that I can incorporate into the design, and use the leftovers for window valances and a chair cushion and the like."

And she said...""Go.  It's on me.""

After I finished babbling my thanks and mopped up the tears, she reminded me of something I'd completely forgotten.  She started going to law school nights when I was 12.  As the oldest girl,  a lot of the cooking, laundry, housework, and raising my younger sister fell on my shoulders.  She promised me that someday, as a reward, she'd send me to Europe.

By the time she could afford it, I had children, and until recently they were too young for me to leave them for more than a few days at a time.  So she's been biding her time. Now the time has come, and she's paying her tab.

We were vending at this one, so I didn't get to see much programming, but I still had a wonderful time.  It was just what I needed to get me out of this costuming slump I've been in.  Now I can't wait to get moved and start working  in my pretty new sewing room!

<lj user=""sstormwatch""> and I spent a lot of time talking about the new Tudor patterns. She's been doing more research into earlier Tudor and we're hoping to incorporate that into the new package.  We also wandered around in our Tudor gowns together, and discovered that both of us have lost weight since making them.  Oh no!  We'll have to make new ones!!!  

We also discovered that our tastes are extremely similar. Every time I started telling her about a costume I was planning, she'd look at me sternly and say ""Stop That!!""  

Many other friends, old and new, were there.  <lj user=""clothsprogs"">!  He's every bit as much fun as you'd think he'd be from his posts. 

One of my favorite parts of the weekend was meeting up with Hilary Ayer and Cathleen Myers, of PEERS fame.  Many years ago we, along with Cathleen's sister Gretchen, were a singing group called Wineberry.  We did medieval and Renaissance music a capella, with Andrews Sisters style harmonies.  So Sunday night after the Masquerade we decided it was time for a reunion. We stood in the hallway on the party floor and sang for an hour.  Amazingly, it all came back to us and we sounded good, after not singing together for 22 years!

Cathleen and I were reminiscing about our younger selves, and how unhappy we were, sometimes, that we weren't well known and successful in our chosen spheres, and never felt like we were in the inner circle of cool people at events.  How wonderful it was to realize that both of us had become the people we longed to be.

I was a little worried that Doug would be bored, but he seemed to have a great time too.  We really enjoyed getting some time away from home.

The best thing about CostumeCon was getting inspired again.  I hadn't realized how much living in a costuming vacuum was contributing to my doldrums.  No more.  Just this morning, I've come up with a whole new theory about a certain historical garment, and made a test diagram of it.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to sew it up later today.  And if that wasn't enough, I drafted the prototype for a new pattern package.

Now it's time to go pick up the keys to our new house.  Happy times!"

On the other hand, I'm struggling not to be vexed that I wasn't able to make anything new for this one. ( Hey, lady, you left a marriage and moved last month, give yourself a break.)  I'm also upset that none of my older costumes fit.  The problem isn't so much weight gain as my shape changing from lack of exercise, and once I start walking and doing crunches again It'll get better.  But in the meantime, I have to be mindful to be kind to myself about it."

We're still working on moving in to Doug's house.  I have my desk and bed set up.  This week we'll (hopefully) get the garage straightened out to the point that I can find my sewing things, and get going on the little repairs and upgrades I need to do on my clothes for CostumeCon.  Sadly, I won't have time to make anything new, and none of my old court dresses will fit, so I'll wear my Comfort outfit and my bellydance things.  At least, I think they won't fit.  I've been feeling really fat lately, but the scale tells me I'm 25 pounds lighter than I was last year, so maybe I should try a few things on and see.  If I can find them.  Right now Doug's garage looks like three Andersons dumped all their stuff in it and stirred.

I can't remember if I posted that 2 weeks after Doug and I decided to move the boys and I in with him, his landlord died, and the heirs decided to put the house on the market.  Even though it probably won't sell for some time, we have no desire to live in a house that's for sale, especially since they only have to give us 30 days notice to get out.   Also, we could use more space, so we're looking.  

Today we looked at  <a href=""http://www.2viewmapping.com/media/central_valley/80005092/standard/?idx=1"">this place.</a>
 The photos don't do it justice.  It's GORGEOUS. It's brand new;  I've never lived anywhere new. It has a wonderful open family room/kitchen,  and a separate living room which we'd use for the business.  The formal dining room (picture #3) would be my sewing room.  It's a far cry from the dank basement where I've been trying to work up enthusiasm for sewing for the last three years.  And there's a sunken bathtub with Jacuzzi! (no, not in the sewing room, silly).

We'll be putting in our application ASAP, so everyone think happy thoughts for us!"

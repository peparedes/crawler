You love to take care of others and people love being around you because you make them feel appreciated. You are very sweet and soft-spoken. You are also a romantic and consider yourself an excellent matchmaker, so you tend to be a bit nosy. But everyone still considers you the sweetest person they know.

Well here I am! in sunny Puerto Rico! So far I like it the people are alot friendlier than MD but I kinda miss the states it is very different everyone and everything off base is in spanish so it can be kinda hard to tell them what you want It can also be dangerous so I don't really go off base by myself I have seen lots of lizards roaming the streets strange and I already have a nice sunburn ha ha School is only 8 weeks a semester so I will be def going around June (I have to wait for spring to finish classes) and I will be working in OB/GYN to get a look at my job So write comments I would love to hear from you all!

There's another world inside of me that you may never see.
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide.
Somewhere in this darkness there's a life that I can't find.
Maybe it's too far away or maybe I'm just blind, maybe I'm just blind.

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong.
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone.
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be.
I'll never let you down even if I could.
I'd give up everything if only for your good.

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong.
You can hold me when I'm scared but you won't always be there,
So love me when I'm gone, love me when I'm gone
When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin.
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends.

Now roaming through this darkness I'm alive but I'm alone.
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone.
So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong.
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone.

Everything I am and everything in me.
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be,
Ill never let you down even if I could.
I'd give up everything if only for your good.

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared, you won't always be there,
So love me when I'm gone.

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong.
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone.

The saddest thing happend just the other day my stepdad died from a blood clot in his stomach At first I thought I could handle it but when I saw him lying there I almost thought he was gonna wake up and say something like ""what are you all doing anyway?"" He looked almost not real like plastic or something The hardest part was saying goodbye He helped me when I enlisted in the Navy keeping from going to insane with the family He also helped me and my mother get out of a rathole of a place in MI when we were so poor we weren't sure how we were gonna make it He used to say I was in the Army cause I guess he was a vet of them as well lol ""you in the Army now"" was his fav phrase I keep thinking that I did not realize that he meant alot more to me than I had thought I almost think I'm gonna see him when I go home sitting in his chair watching westerns or something My mom has gotten me worried to I am going back to see that she is okay She took it pretty hard being alone and all But I know he is always watching us kids and my mom keeping us from going into a depression and that does bring a sense of relief I guess I did however put one of my medals in the casket to go with him The National Defense Medal for serving the U.S Armed Forces during the time of war I think if it wasn't for his encouragement I would have been less of a proud sailor as I am today He deserved that more than anything and I will never forget what he had done for me and my mom....

My roomate Candance left for Japan yesterday I miss her It seems weird whenever I go into my room and find it empty Another freind of mine leaves in July I guess that is the Navy for ya I thought about posting this song I remember before going to boot camp about losing friends and all that blah So here it is 


I Won't Forget You

Late at night I close my eyes
And think of how things could have been
And when I look back
I remember some words you had said to me

It's better to have lost at love 
Then never to have loved at all

Chorus
I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
Even though I should
I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

Sometimes in my head
I can still see pictures of you
And I laugh to myself
When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

Chorus

I should let you fade away
But that just wouldn't be me
Oh, baby

Solo

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
Memories slowly fade
I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
And all the plans we made

I won't forget you baby"

He was doin 40  on the freeway
In the 6 double 0 bumpin Isley
He was gettin kinda close kinda touch-ay
Guess, he had a little too much Hennessey
He told me that he wanna go home
Wit me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him ""Boo, I don't really know though""
He got close up to me... it started gettin deep
He had me in a huss when he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
i never cool you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

~Repeat Chorus~

So hot n the 6 now, so hot
Had to roll all the windows down
Eyes lead and I'm thinkin bout the sheets now
Wonderin should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
Well all his slick-ass lines was kinda workin
I felt my knees get weak... his body was callin me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets

Wyclef:  This is the remix
The jeeps pump this new remix
This is the remix
Radios play it

Chorus: You be sayin'
No no no no no
When it's really
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(x 4)

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you ""What's the deal?""
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you

Chorus

If you keep actin' this way
You're gonna' lose my love
I ain't got no time to play
You better hurry up
'Cause everytime I come around
And cruise by your way
I see you on the corner
But you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you baby
You seem so shy
What's the problem babe
Never had a girl like I
I can see right through you
And you know you wanna' be mine
So get your act together
'Cause you're runnin' out of time

Chorus

Everytime I see you
With your boys
You pretend as if
You don't want me
When you get home
You call me on the phone
And tell me
How much you care

Wyclef: Close your eyes shorty
You're guaranteed to be hypnotized
By the remix that Wyclef provide
I don't care 'bout your side
Girl shake your thighs
All I'm tryin' to do
In the hood is stay alive
Make a little money
With Desiny's Child
Thugs hear the song they dance
They go wild like Texas
They movin' like no limit soldiers
They went from a dream
To the young supremes
Sing it girls

you liked me till' you heard my shit on the radio
well i hate to say but pop ain't going solo
you liked me till' you heard my shit on the radio
but now I'm just too mainstream for you, oh no
you liked me till' you seen me on your t.v.
well if you're so low below then why you watching
you say good things come to those who wait
well I've been waiting a long time for it

chorus:
i remember the days when i was so eager to satisfy you
and be less then i was just to prove i could walk beside you
now that I've flown away i see you've chosen to stay behind me
and still you curse the day i decided to stay true to myself

you say your quest is to bring it higher
well i never seen change without a fire
but from your mouth i have seen a lot of burning
but underneath i think it's a lot of yearning
your face, the colours change from green to yellow
to the point where you can't even say hello
you tell me you'd kill me if i ever snob you out
like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what i'm about

c h o r u s

bridge:
it's so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing you're cool
than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
than to burn in the spotlight, turn in the spitfire
scream without making a sound, be up here and not look down because we're all afraid of heights

c h o r u s

why ya hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me so so, leave me down down down down low leave me down da down down da down da down down down...shit on the radio... shit on the radio... shit on the radio... shit on the radio

Written by Twain/Lange
Am I dreamin' or stupid?
I think I've been hit by Cupid
But no one needs to know right now 
I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy makin' big plans
But no one needs to know right now 

I got my heart set, my feet wet
And he don't even know it yet
But no one needs to know right now 

I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now 

I want bells to ring, achoir to sing
The white drees the guests the cake the car the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right know right now 

I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But I'm goona keeep it a secret for now 

We'll have a little girl a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
But no one needs to know right now 

And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only only he can make it right

Instant love (50-70 points)
Countrygir, you like playing with fire, no wonder that you fall in love very easily. You prefer to be in seventh heaven and to enjoy this feeling to the max. However when your dreams don't come true, then you feel down and disillusioned. Sometimes it's better to keep a cool head and to check out if you are really serious about your relationship. Because love also requires dependability and honesty."

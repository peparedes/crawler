"event","Well it's been awhile since I posted here - I cannot write well enough how I am growing more and more... I posted in my other journal about Passion, and how It stirs once again within me... it's been 3 1/2 very long years since I could write that, since I could feel that...

I've been working alot with Balancing - I got some new cards from New Zealand - they're incredible.  It's felt so good.  And the Goddess has blessed me with time for quiet, solitude, introspection and exploration - and cleaning!  We have company coming next week - a Shaman and his wife, a Co-walker - and their two children.  Certainly the house willnot be perfection by Martha Stewart's standards - but then, her new ""perfection"" will be a 4' X 5' cell painted some puke-green or blue shade of colour, so what's the big deal with HER opinion, anyway?  *wink*

Oh, a backdate from my last post - I managed to get my article in by deadline, and the dishes came out just fine!  *LOL*... such small and tiny things can bind me so.  I hope to grow up from that, for it's quite something to be so swept away by such smallness.

I feel upswept right now, stirred to new life, even as I am still down with my illness.

Cocoa.  I'm going to make some cocoa and watch a movie with the kids.  They've got the day off... I'm going to enjoy them, however they want - and with a trip to the public library, at my son's request."

"event","The weekend was a strange one for me.  I am trying to break free from some of my own tendancies that keep me from relaxing with my hubby...

And yet, I find great comfort in the things that I do, and find it abundantly frustrating and frazzling to not do the things that I do.

What I am talking about is making lists - planning, organizing, having a ""program"", knowing what I'm going to do, the order I want to do it in, making sure everything will all ""fit"", and not *just* ""fit"", but fit *into place*...

This weekend was the first that I've ever not had a ""map for the weekend"".  No list to run from of things I wanted to do, was obligated to do, would consider doing...  It was just ""roll with the day"".  Very odd.  Very challenging to me.

And I sit and ask myself why I did this, if it causes me so much angst.  And I realize that I did it so I could try to relax and just ""let things fall into place"" like he does ... like he wishes I could do more often.

It worked out just fine - we made it to the show we wanted to go to, made it to the *beautiful* 2-hour long supper at the wonderful restaurant we had a gift certificate for, and we accomplished getting the groceries...

Sometimes I think that I have to write down and list and organize and plan like I do so I can see what I accomplish.  It's a great feeling.  And even *relaxing* is an accomplishment for me.  That's why I can add ""crochet"" or ""cross-stitch"" or ""read, write, journal"" on my ""List of Things to Do"".  I feel good when I get to them and can see it and say, ""Yeah, I did that, and it was really, really nice""!

*pause for thoughtful sigh and reflection*...

Perhaps I need to continue to make the lists for my comfort and keep them aside from his view so I do not cause him discomfort.

I am, without regret, a planner.  I pencil in time for spontenaity, for Christ's sake!!

Hmmmm... much to ponder.  Much to think upon.

It was a good weekend, it was.  Challenging, but good.  I'm just trying to deal with the ""what the hell did I *do* this weekend"" taste that has left a bitter stain on my tongue.  I believe it comes from the thought that - though we had a delightful time - I did not get the dishes done nor the house cleaned, did not put the finishing touches on my article, did not wrap up my content for the divination workshop I will teach in only 5 days...

Poop.

But it was what it was - and what it was was BEAUTIFUL... so I'll just have to knock the rest of these things off as we go along this week.

Yeah, I'm doin' okay - I'm doing great!"

"event","This is my second LJ, my first one being a paid account.  I felt it necessary to break away from my main journal so I could write deeper things here, more freely roam the Wilderness of Shadow Within, examine more closely what it means to me to be of a Warrior Clan, let the breath of my Soul stir the tender whisps of the Web that I am weaving, to check it's integrity.

I am Being Real.  I am stepping up to the perverbial plate as Me.  I have grown and shape-shifted soul-u-larly more in the past year than I can say.  It feels awesome.  It's very freeing.

I am proud of the Woman I am, of the woman I always was and am only now uncovering.  I am proud of the work that I have done, and stand with my head held high.

There are ""storm winds"" blowing about my Realm right now, but I meet them with all that I am.  I am making every attempt and effort to greet each new day and face all that these winds bring with courage, honesty, openness without being a martyr.

I want to face my fears.  I want to ride the winds of Change - and see where they will take me.  I will look hardness in it's face, and give it my best shot.

And in the end, no matter what, I will be okay - because I still have Me.

Welcome to my Realm.

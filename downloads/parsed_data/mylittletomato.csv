"event","Thank you Chris Rose

> From columnist Chris Rose of The Times-Picayune www.nola.com

Dear America,

I suppose we should introduce ourselves: We're South Louisiana.

We have arrived on your doorstep on short notice and we apologize for that,
but we never were much for waiting around for invitations. We're not much on
formalities like that.

And we might be staying around your town for a while, enrolling in your
schools and looking for jobs, so we wanted to tell you a few things about
us. We know you didn't ask for this and neither did we, so we're just going
to have to make the best of it.

First of all, we thank you. For your money, your water, your food, your
prayers, your boats and buses and the men and women of your National Guards,
fire departments, hospitals and everyone else who has come to our rescue.

We're a fiercely proud and independent people, and we don't cotton much to
outside interference, but we're not ashamed to accept help when we need it.
And right now, we need it.

Just don't get carried away. For instance, once we get around to fishing
again, don't try to tell us what kind of lures work best in your waters.

We're not going to listen. We're stubborn that way.

You probably already know that we talk funny and listen to strange music and
eat things you'd probably hire an exterminator to get out of your yard.

We dance even if there's no radio. We drink at funerals. We talk too much
and laugh too loud and live too large and, frankly, we're suspicious of
others who don't.

But we'll try not to judge you while we're in your town.

Everybody loves their home, we know that. But we love South Louisiana with a
ferocity that borders on the pathological. Sometimes we bury our dead in LSU
sweatshirts.

Often we don't make sense. You may wonder why, for instance - if we could
only carry one small bag of belongings with us on our journey to your
state - why in God's name did we bring a pair of shrimp boots?

We can't really explain that. It is what it is.

You've probably heard that many of us stayed behind. As bad as it is, many
of us cannot fathom a life outside of our border, out in that place we call
Elsewhere.

The only way you could understand that is if you have been there, and so
many of you have. So you realize that when you strip away all the craziness
and bars and parades and music and architecture and all that hooey, really,
the best thing about where we come from is us.

We are what made this place a national treasure. We're good people. And
don't be afraid to ask us how to pronounce our names. It happens all the
time.

When you meet us now and you look into our eyes, you will see the saddest
story ever told. Our hearts are broken into a thousand pieces.

But don't pity us. We're gonna make it. We're resilient. After all, we've
been rooting for the Saints for 35 years. That's got to count for something.

OK, maybe something else you should know is that we make jokes at
inappropriate times.

But what the hell.

And one more thing: In our part of the country, we're used to having
visitors. It's our way of life.

So when all this is over and we move back home, we will repay to you the
hospitality and generosity of spirit you offer to us in this season of our
despair.

That is our promise. That is our faith.

Too bad the one day i wanted to buy something from best buy they were slow as fuck and it took me a bajillion hours.  but its ok because i'm happy!  It's amazing how spending over a thousand dollars can make you feel better.

P.S. I ran into someone from Franklin today who just transfered from Loyola.  She was so stressed and looked terribly depressed.  I can't imagine having to transfer schools my last year.  Especially to a huge ass school like LSU.  And the bookstore was mean to her and wouldn't let her return a book because she missed the date...even though she didn't get to lsu until less than a week ago.  stupid inconsiderate bastards."

I SURE DO...NOT!  It's cool though.  for some reason i'm not completely freaking out right now.  i still got about half my paper done and now that i've got a delicious tall white mocha from starbucks and a layered peanut butter pastry i should be just fine. Not only is caffeine my stress eliminator but i also think it's an anti-depressant.  I see studies in the future.

"event","So Mardi Gras 2005 will come to an end w/i the next 7 minutes and I'm sad to see it go.  It's been a kick ass crazy few days filled with lots of booz, awesome friends, beads, and as always boy drama.

Friday:  after a 2 hr drive to New Orleans I hit up Mandy's masquerade ball w/ a kick ass ""sweet 16"" dress from the 80's.  I had a blast as I impressed everyone w/ my booty dancing skills. Then of course, my crush for josh increased 10 fold after he wooed me all night.
Saturday: walked the streets w/ margo before endymion and we ran into our dear old friend Leland who joined us for the rest of the night.  Kayla, david, and amanda got their drunk/high asses over too and we had a blast watching the parade.  The night was somewhat spoiled by Josh who acted competely different from the night before, but oh well...his loss.  Then, Lindsay and Cassie appeared late into the night after getting lost in New Orleans...glad i could save them.
Sunday:  recoup day.  lounged around w/ linday and cassie all day until the parade.  Watched Bacchus w/ my sister's friends and was joined later by amanda david and kayla.  Cassie and Lindsay had a much better night and actually got to see the parade w/ all of us.  Hung out at Amanda's for awhile afterwards but sleep overcame all of us.  
Monday: Beignets with Lindsay and Cassie before they headed back to BR.  Joined up with amanda david and kayla later for Proteus and Orpheus.  After walking a million blocks down St. Charles in the rain we ran into Kelly and then Ryan.  The two of them joined us for drunken festivities.  After spilled daqueries, being molested by an old woman who insisted i flash, and various ""moments"" w/ everyone, it was time to call it a night.  
Tuesday: headed down to the avenue to watch Rex with the family. Ate tons of awesome food and got to visit with all my sisters.  Came home and rested and then headed to Amanda's for movie night w/ her and kayla and david.  The Village wasn't too bad...just bizarre.  Had to sit through Napoleon Dynamite again...lord help me.  Ate more food and then finally decided to call it a night.

So anywho, that's a BRIEF synopsis of my time in new orleans.  My only regrets are not walking the parade routes uptown like I usually do to see people I know and missing out on the day parades because i was too tired from the night before.  Next year I think we'll get a hotel room on St. Charles so we don't have to worry about driving.  Hope everyone enjoyed the break as much as I did.  Tomorrow i'll head to the dentist before driving back to BR...lucky me, and then spend the night studying and doing homework.  The semester officially starts for me tomorrow.  Good night and HAPPY MARDI GRAS!"

The first person I see when I walk in is good ole Christian (aka old man i went out w/ this past summer).  He comes up, puts his arm around my waste like i'm his freakin girlfriend and gives me this hug.  Of course I wanted to completely freak out right there but I remained cool and let endless amounts of beer ease my nerves.  Later in the night I went up to him and said that I wanted a dance before the night was over and he assured me it would happen.  Well a little while later i was looking for him and after no luck assumed he had left...without saying goodbye.  Thanks asshole.  It really got to me and kinda ruined the rest of the night.  David, Amanda, and Kayla were really awesome though and helped me get through it.  Friends rock!  So anyway, I had to wake up this morning at 9:00am and go volunteer for the krewe of mutts parade.  I had a good time and saw a bunch of my widlife friends and my sister's friend Brittany.  Oh and i saw my sister's friend Tricia last night so it was definitely the weekend of seeing old faces.  Oh and i almost adopted this cute greyish/white puppy today that was so skinny and sad looking. i wanted to give him lots of love and make him fat. oh well.  I think Margo and I are going to go watch the grudge...i'm scared already!  Hope everyone had a good weekend.

"event","Thank god lj is back up and running!  I was very distraught last night when I couldn't post a drunk entry about the Mardi Gras Ball.  Anyway, I had such a great time last night.  I got along w/ all the other girls pretty well and got to see a bunch of other people i used to go to school with.  Everyone said I looked beautiful and confident.  The supper dance was a ton of fun too because my siblings and I joked around all night at the dinner table.  At one point when i got up to go dance i managed to knock my chair over and of course got an ovation from everyone at the table.  I do my best to keep everyone entertained.
So I feel much better now that I've gotten one of these dealies out of the way.  The other two should go by smoother now and less stressful.  I'm not too excited about Mystery though since it's in the middle of the week and it's a much smaller ball.  But it's all good.  The experience in itself is amazing and I'll have no regrets about it in the end. Anywho, thanks all of you who came to see me prance around.  You guys are the best!
much love,

I really wish Josh and I would have hit it off.  He would have been a fun date, plus he's already in new orleans so it wouldn't be a big deal getting there.  Maybe someone will appear on my doorstep tomorrow!  I should have gone to Richie's party...even though I don't even know him.  Maybe i should have stayed in new orleans.  I came back to work on pre-vet stuff w/ David but that only happened one night and then he had to go back to sulfur to be Kayla's date for a mardi gras ball she's in.  stupid pre vet club.
  Maybe I will just go home tomorow and that way I could bring my computer home for colette to fix..hmmm...oooh and then maybe she could hook me up w/ that guy she's been raving about.  oh wait, is his name josh too? hahaha i think so! too funny. Well, i got nothing else to say so ta ta."

"event","So it's officially the last day of 2004.  How are you going to spend it?  Hopefully I'll go to bed in about a 1/2 hr, then i'll wake up, possibly eat waffles for breakfast, go to the riverfront and maybe take some pictures, then lounge around all day w/ mom.  Oh wait i probably have to go back to the seamstress so she can fix my ball gown...blah that's no fun.  Anywho, I was the biggest bum in the world today...I laid around in my pajama's until 5pm.  I did however spend all that time babysitting madison and michael.  Thank god my mom was there too 'cause I just didn't have the energy to take care of both of them.  Finally after dinner I headed over to Mandy's and hung out with her for a few hours.  We went to Barnes & Noble and then Target (where i bought a really cute black sweater for under $10) and then back to her apartment.  I absolutely loooove where she lives.  (Margo, it's right around where Jan used to live.) She then burned me a Gavin Degraw CD which is AMAZING.  He is sooo talented and is now my new love.  She also cleaned out her closet and gave me all kinds of HOT going out shirts.  I love shopping in her closet!  I also used our quality time together to figure out the deal w/ Josh.  Although she swears she would never date him, I get the feeling that there is this underlying sexual tension b/w them.  I'm also pretty sure she doesn't want me to go out w/ him but she'd never tell me that to my face.  However, her actions have spoken pretty loudly.  So now i dunno what to do about tomorrow. She said if she goes to his party then i can go w/ her but i'm sooo scared that i'm not going to be outgoing and that i'm just going to sit in the corner all night 'cause i won't know anyone.  Plus all these people are several years older than I am so it's not like we have much in common.  But then there's this liiiiittle part of me that says i'm gonna be bummed out if i don't at least make an appearance just to see him.  I guess in my little fantasy world, i'd show up (looking all hot of course) and as soon as he'd see me he'd give me this look (can't put it into words so just stay w/ me here) and then come up to me and give me the sweetest hug in the world.  Then of course we'd be inseparable for the rest of the evening and i'd get my new year's kiss.  God i'm the biggest dork!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's what happens when you've been single for too long.  So anyway, back to my point...do i go to the party or not? my other choices are going to my cousin's party where i won't really know anyone either but at least they'll all be my age...but then again that's not necessarily a good thing.  Lastly, I can go to baton rouge and probably not do anything.  I'd call david and maybe we'd go to Kelly's friend's party but I have no idea what kind of party that would be.  You know what. I think I just need to stop being soo pessimistic and just go to Josh's party!  If i go in with a great attitude feeling confident then i'll have a good time.  Guess we'll have to wait and see how i feel tomorrow night.  With my luck Mandy could change her mind and not go to the party and then i'd definitely not go.  WHy didn't he just calll? haha he probably didn't realize i put my number in his phone.  Ok i've babbled on enough.  I wrote this mostly for myself just so i could get all these thoughts out of my head and somewhat organized.  Hope everyone has more decisive plans for new year's eve.  goodnight

"event","So does anyone else think christmas break is flying by wayyyy too fast?  I mean christmas is already over so all we have left to look forward to is New years...but who likes that holiday anyway.

I saw Splangish tonight with Madeleine.  I was very dissapointed and now feel I need to watch a happy romantic comedy like American Sweethearts or Serendipity.  At least dinner was enjoyable with Mad and her parents.  Always such lovely conversation with mama jo and p. daddy.

I finally found white shoes to go with my ball gowns.  I tried them on with the dresses just to make sure everything fit right and was happy with the first dress, but aggravated with the second.  It's kinda tight right under my chest so the fabric rolls a bit which looks silly and there's a pull in the chiffon layer.  Oh well, just won't eat for the next month.  I bet everyone is sick of me talking about the balls but it seems to be taking over my life and giving me unnecessary stress.  I should be enjoying all this debutant crap, not sulking about it.  Oh well.

So Christena is getting married on wednesday. crrrrrrrrrrazy.  Didn't we just graduate like yesterday? ok so not really, but it was only a few years ago.  I will be going alone which will be sad, but I'll be seeing plenty of old franklin people.  I'm hoping the black strapless dress will look as hot as I think it will. I'm making madeleine go to baton rouge with me tomorrow for the day so i can get my hot mama shoes and a few other things to last me over in new orleans at least 'till after new years.  Still haven't decided what i'm doing for the big day and won't anytime soon.

No more to say."

"event","So this is definitely a Christmas to remember and I think everyone else who was in New Orleans would have to agree.  The snow was wonderful and I had a snow ball fight with Robbie, Eddie, Steve and Madison.  I got the few things i wanted but the presents didn't even matter.  I just needed to see my family and the snow.  Later that night I braved the icy streets and went to Mandy's for a little christmas party.  Most of her friends backed out because of the weather but I'd like to think that my presence convinced Josh to go.  I secretly put my number in his phone (actually he may have saw) while he was dancing w/ a sword on his head (lol don't ask) so maybe he'll call me.  It may seem desparate but i know the guy likes me so i don't really care.  I drank too much though and woke up with a bit of a hangover.  I've had this icky feeling in my stomach all day and hopefully by tomorrow it will be gone.  I did however manage to gather up enough energy to go to my mardi gras ball party.  I got to meet the other girls that are in Mystery with me and to my surprise Sarah Stickney was there.  For you non-franklinites, sarah and i rode the bus together at franklin.  So anyway, I was glad to see her 'cause i was afraid i'd be in it with a bunch of snotty girls that didn't like me.  Afterwards i came home and slept from about 4-9.  I had a few unpleasant dreams which has left me in a bit of slump.  I probably won't be able to fall asleep anytime soon now because of my 5 hr nap so hopefully there's something good on TV.

On a side note, I hate this 'dating' thing. I don't really know how it works 'cause i haven't been on one in forever.  I really wish I would meet someone soon...i just miss that feeling of having someone that cares for you and that you care for. 

Anywho, Saban is gone.  I yelled when i heard on the news even though I had a gut feeling he was leaving anyway...i think everyone did.  I'll miss staying after the game for 20 minutes just to see him come out and wave to use and thank us for being so supportive.  Those were goodtimes.

Well, from other journals i have read and people i have talked to, it seems like we all had a pretty nice christmas.  I think we all agreed we are ready to get back to baton rouge and see each other.  I certainly miss everyone.  Love you all and Merry Christmas!

Thank god she's coming on the camping trip, too.  So my last final is tomorrow and i'm thrilled!  Well not thrilled that I have to take a final, but that it's my last one.  I'm going to be running around like a chicken with his head cut off tomorrow.  I have to wake up and study, take my final at 12:30, then run to walgreens to buy thorr a dog bone, do a shit load of laundry, make crawfish pies for the dinner, pack for camping, then get ready for the dinner...ahhhh. I hate being rushed.  Hopefully my final won't take the whole time, and i can always stop at a walgreens on the way to lindsey's to buy a dog bone for Thorr.  I knew i should have done laundry today..blasted.  Ok sorry about the rambling.  I tend to do that alot.  Well, i guess i should hit the sack.  goodnight all.

"event","So i had a really good thanksgiving.  Got to see robbie, eddie, nicole and her two kids,  james and his 3 kids, michelle and andy, uncle edward and aunt judy, and colette.  The highlight of the day would have been sitting on the front porch with Michael all wrapped up in a blanket on my lap as I rocked in the rocking chair, and Madison chalking on the sidewalk.  I felt like a mom and it was wonderful.  I had never experienced that ""motherly"" feeling before and  thus never really had the urge to have children, but that peaceful moment with just them hit the spot.  
Friday was quite eventful.  I got my picture taken that morning and went to a tea that afternoon.  I was surprised to see a bunch of my old holy name friends but it made the whole ordeal much more bearable.  Saturday i headed back to baton rouge and worked on tree crap allllll afternoon.  It was such a relief to get as much done as I did.  I was able to enjoy today much more.  Wal-mart's automotive department sucks though and I wouldn't recommend getting your oil changed there.  Maybe it was the fact I went on a sunday afternoon ...who knows.  I got to sit by a cute guy however as I waited and watched Shrek on one of the little tv's they had set up.

So overall i thorougly enjoyed break.  I didn't go out and waste money or drink and i caught up on much needed sleep.  I'm not looking forward to my two finals this week or the next four the following week.  However, it will be a huge relief to turn in my plant portfolio...phew.  Speaking of which, I need to go work on that some more.  Hope everyone had a good thanksgiving.  I look forward to reading your posts.

wow, Pearl Jam's Greatest Hits cd is AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGG.  I pre-ordered it and it came in today (one day before it actually hits stores...lucky me)!  I've heard of the majority of the songs, but a few keep popping up that i've never heard of and it makes me fall in love with this band even more. 

I've been quite productive with my dendrology collection.  I've started putting them into a binder...it's a very slow process but I've already done 30 plants in the past couple days.  Only 90 more to go!  Once it's all done I think i'll have a ""showing"" of the magnificent binder.  You'll be able to see all the dedication i've put into this class...the blood and sweat.  Speaking of blood, my cut hurt like a beeotch today and wearing gloves for lab didn't help at all.  I also kept forgetting it was there, so i'd bang it spastically against something and i'd get this shooting pain in my finger.  You have no idea how many times i almost yelled ""fuuuuu**"" in the middle of the quad.

Well that's all for now.  Everyone needs to update obnoxiously often like meeee! i love you.

"event","I watched the most incredibly thing on TV night.  It was a documentary w/ Eowen McGreggor (i think that's his name...guy from Big Fish) and a friend of his (possibly some other english actor) traveling around the world on motorcycles.  The adds kept referring to them going from London to New York...so I assume that would be traveling all around the world.  The part I saw was when they were in Kazakastan.  The images were absolutely beautiful!  They were trying to make it as real as possible and not have any special treatment, but police offers kept stopping them and then escorting them to the next area to prevent anyone from trying to hurt them.  But all the locals were so welcoming and excited to see them.  Anyway, i must have caught a rerun 'cause i think it comes on Thursday a 7pm, Bravo channel.  I definitely recommend everyone turning it and watching a part of it.  It made me want to take a road trip.

Anyway, today was kinda lazy.  I slept 'till 10:17 which is a record for me this semester...i can't remember the last time i slept past 8.  Then i lounged around a long time until I finally went and got my car from the vet parking lot and my keys from amanda. My camera is still in david's possesion but hopefully i'll get that back tomorrow.  I some how managed to spread all my belongings out to everyone yesterday at the game...hehe.  Afterwards I decided to collect some more plants for dendrology.  I have just about all the ones i need, and hopefully can get the rest of them this week.  I even started pressing them and putting them in my binder.  However, while cutting a twig with my handy knife, i managed to slice my finger pretty bad, and had to sit in the bathroom for about 10 minutes while I lost a pint of blood.  I'm ok now though, it's just sore.  Overall, it took me around 1 1/2 hrs(maybe more?) to do 15 pressings.  I figured if i do a few each day it won't be as bad.  I have a total of 100 to do, and possibly up to 120 if i do the bonuses. 

Well, the yawns are taking over so time to hit the hay.  Hope everyone had a great weekend...i know i did.  love yall.

Luckily he was willing to wait by the vet school for me so i could go pick it up.  He had cool camo pants and forever I will love camo (even though i already did..hehe...but i'll love it more now).  Anywho, today went by soooo fast.  We didn't get out to tailgate 'till late and then we spent most of the time walking around and meeting friends of friends.  It was quite enjoyable.  I'm so glad Madeleine and Bridget came in.  It was nice seeing a fresh face, even for a little while.  Hopefully they won't have to haul ass back to Millsaps next time.  Well, my joints hurt (damn the cold weather! oh but i love it so much) so i'm going to lounge around the rest of the evening.  Tomorrow I will spend the WHOLE day working on my plant pressings so I can get that done and out the way.  Might have to make a few trips around baton rouge to find the rest of my samples though.

I thought being historian wouldn't be as stressful, but since I have to take on the responsibilities of certain other officers i'm doing way more than I originally planned.  I definitely wouldn't have been able to handle a job this semester.  However, i need to look for one over break so i can pay my bills next semester.  Guess I won't be going to New York, again.

On a more cheery, less vulgar note, I'm looking forward to playing kickball on sunday.

SERIOUSLY PEOPLE...WHAT ARE YOU ACCOMPLISHING? And then there are those who think they know what they're actually talking about...but really all they know is what the media tells them. They watch stupid ass movies like fahrenheit 911 and make their decision based on one guy's opinion. If reality TV has taught us anything, it's that ""reality"" can be portrayed in any way the producer wants. Voiceovers, clever editing...that's all that was done in that fat guy's movie. Maybe he did have some good points and actual truths but how would one know when half the time you can't even see the person's face who's talking. In conclusion, I would like to thank all of those who voted today based on their own opinions of the candidates, not their parent's, friend's, or peter jenning's. I, myself, made a choice too, and that was not to vote. Maybe it was because I was too lazy to drive the hour and a half home in the rain, or the fact that I'm not a fan of either candidate and think it would be bad ass if they both threw in the towel and let the little guy win for once. But at least I can walk around with my head up high knowing that I made a choice all on my own, not based on what other people told me to do."

Anywho, I'm reading about gianta panda movements in the Foping Nature Reserve in China.  It's quite fascinating.  However I do not feel like writing a paper on it though.  Basically we just have to summarize the article, which is RETARDED.  I never understood why teachers gave us assignments like this.  It would be much more interesting if we could use multiple journal articles similar to this one, and then write a paper on how their experiments are related and what further research could be done, etc etc.  When you summarize you don't think, you just paraphrase.  Let us use these minds of ours for once!  

In other news, the party is just a few days away and i'm excited!  Although my costume is not complete and probably won't be until late friday night (hopefully), I cannot wait to see everyone all dressed up.  Tailgating will be so much fun with all of us in togas.

Last but not least I got WONDERFUL news today.  I was awarded the Rockefeller Wildlife Scholarship..yesssss!  I've been waiting for MONTHS to find out and was starting to lose hope...but alas.  All this studying to make good grades paid off for something.  This will look really great on my resume when I apply for a wildlife internship this summer.  Speaking of which I need to start looking into that.

Well, time to start plagarizing...i mean summarizing..hehe.  I consider them more or less the same thing.  buh bye."

"event","The weekend has come to an end and I am NOT looking forward to this week.  I don't want to work on my micro presentation, nor study for experimental stats test, nor write a reivew for rnr...bahhhhhhh.  Oh and i have to figure out what classes i'm taking so i can schedule on friday.  Still looking for a costume too...what to wear what to wear.  But anyway, this weekend was fun...i'll leave it at that.  Train has a whole new feeling now.

"event","I just remembered one funny thing I did today...

In experimental stats this morning i kinda zoned out and started singing ""on top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese...."" not even realizing i was singing it out loud.  I think Josh and Lindsay got a kick out of it.  Josh even asked for an encore."

"event","I had the best conversation with my mom tonight and I am so happy.  We were finally able to have a discussion without bringing up money or whether or not i was coming home for christmas.  For once she just listened and that's exactly what I needed.

I can't wait to get all these tests and papers and presentations out the way next week so I can start on my plant pressings.

Jason is so cuuuuuuuute.   Why does he have to be my T.A.?  Today he told me I was the best speller in the class...hehe.

I can't stand a dirty apartment so I gave in and vacuumed.  I'm turning into my mother.

Back to studying....

P.S. My life consist of studying at all times now...sorry guys."

"event","So we're officially having a costume halloween party next Saturday after the game (oct 30).  We would love for ALLLL of you to dress up and come.  After contemplating costume ideas for days, I've finally settled on an ""80's"" attire.  I'll definitely have lots of fun putting it together and reliving that classic decade.  Margo may possibly join me or use my awesome gold sequence dress as a costume.  
In other news, things seem to be turning around.  Dendroloogy (tree) class had been stressing me out lately but our teacher gave a rather encouraging lecture today that renewed my faith in getting a decent grade in the class.  On the otherside, studying all weekend for micro didn't do my grade justice so it looks like i'll be stuck with a B in the class.  I still have a chance for an A in Ecology, though, as long as I get an A on the test on Friday.  And good ole experimental stats is keeping me alive with a strong A.  So for now, I'll simma down and just accept the grades as they are.  
So let's list all the crap I have due in the next week:
Micro Lab quiz tomorrow
Tree quiz (every tues and thurs)
Experimental stats quiz due friday
Ecology test Friday
Experimental stats test next Tuesday
Micro lab presentation due next wednesday
Article Review for ecology due next friday

Phew...oh yeah and i have to volunteer Friday afternoon at the Baton Rouge Zoo, work on the display case for the pre-vet club in Parker Colliseum, call a bunch of hotels in College Station, TX to make reservations for our bus trip, go to new orleans at some point to get my picture taken for the newspaper, plan our halloween party, and meet with my counselor so I can schedule clases.   Well damn i'm a busy bee.  Guess I better get some rest.  Oh one more thing.  I'm selling pancake tickets for the ""All you can eat pancake breakfast"" November 6th.  They are $3.50 each and I have to sell 5 so if you guys could buy them from me that would be great!  I mean come on, it's all you can eat pancakes!  and i think they have other kinds of food there too, like sausage (sorry kelli!).  Plus i heard it's reeeeeally good.  Soo, you guys buy them, and we'll all eat pancakes together Saturday morning, Nov 6th!
goodnight
Ann Marie"

I did hear some news that didnt settle too well with me today. One of my Ex Girl friends is getting ready to have a baby. I havnt talked to her in a while but when i did, she would seem like she was even close to be ready to be having a baby. Sure people can change but knowing her she probably hasnt. Its not my life but for some reason it put me in a bad mood.  O well tho. 

So back i go to my boring life..."

we all went to kissimmi to race watch jaz race the microtech integra (integra was crazy fast) Jaz broke his car. I raced an SER with the VE motor and beat him from a 2nd gear roll. He wanted to do a first gear roll, i was all for it but we didnt get a chance. Cops came we all ran. 

Jaun pissed him self! He was taking a piss when the cops came and had to choke it back and run and he leak on his leg.

Ashely pays for the apartment tomorrow and we start moving her stuff in. She is so happy!"

After the track we went to Kissimmi area to do some racing, had a great time there as well. Dante raced and beat another SRT4 twice :) Go D-Squat!

Went to the track on friday and the best run i could pull was a 14.6 @ 95mph. This was at 8 psi tho, my BOV was leaking and causing the car to run like ass. Today i put on my other BOV and the car seems much faster :) Maybe back to the track on Weds. to find out..."

Which causes my throat to be sore and makes it really really hard to swallow anything. I felt this starting a few days ago, but i didnt do anything to try to prevent it, like drink Orange Juice or taking some vitamins. No, i waited till they are as swollen as they can get. 
pain
I laid down around 6.30pm,  ashely was taking care of me, she got some vitamins and made some tea. I was half passed out and i swore she said she was gonna make some soup, but i dont know what happened to that. Its now 1.30am i get up and look in the kitchen and i see some soup sitting on the burner, looks like its been there a few hours. Doesnt look too good.

Shortly after i posted last Bryce called me and we chatted a bit, it was good to hear from him. 

Ashely and Sucio started to take the sound tar shit out of my car. they got pretty far but not done yet, so dont you two think you're done, you started now you must finish. Once they are done, i need to figure away to get the glue stuff off all the seams so i can start stitch/seam welding the inside of the car. then have to figure away to do the engine bay without pulling the motor. Chassis stiffening and strengthen is fun :)"

Taking apart the inside of my car tomorrow. Everything is coming out but seats and dash. Going to take out the tar shit, and maybe paint the inside just so its clean. Also going to clean the carpet and such. Need to also clean the engine bay up. Its a bit messy from the last time the car broke. 

Front mount is coming soon, need Al (the crazy asain) to make me some piping. After that i think I'm going to calm down on building the car and turn my attention on to something else. 

Dante came home from work today and informed me that they (Publix) is hiring. They have a full time Stock position open. He is going to talk with them tomorrow and let me know whats up. I need a job and if i dont have to deal with costumers then i so want this job. Dont care what the pay is like, as long as i have some cash coming in and it will get the mother off my back."

she = ""lady friend""
I hate ex boy friends. I know when some people break up they continue to be friends with their ex's. But still i dont like this one. I really never liked him, even before i met her. She tells me that i have nothing too worry about, and i believe her. But there is always something in the back of my mind telling me otherwise. Yes I trust her, dont know why it bothers me... The other day he told one of his friends that he thinks she is mad at him, she hears this and calls him and tells him ""no no no, i'm not mad at you. Why would you think that.""  I hear from her that she really doesnt like him all that much (not that shes mad at him for anything) just that she doesnt really care about him. If thats true, why cant she just stop calling him, stop talking to him. Just cut it all off together. I guess thinks are more complicated then i see them. I guess thats fine. I do like her a lot, and trust her. Just just the voice in the back of my head. I am a very jealous guy and dont want to get hurt. And maybe this is the only thing keeping me from moving on to the next step with her, but i dont know. I really haven't had the time to sit down and really think about it. I have been super busy lately. Its really wearing me out, I can feel my self getting sick again, bad headaches are back. right now my whole body aches and its all tense. I need a body massage. 

Going back to finish Jason's car sick or not. I must get that thing finished. Its been smooth so far, i just cant give up.  I have 3 more to do after this one is complete, but the will be much easier then this one is.."

On the way out there Keven (CA18DET) Peter (SR20DET) and I (SR20DET) were driving down University and a Mustang GT starts trying to race us. We all take off and the 3 240's own his ass. Peter flashes hazards like a rice boy! But the mustang wouldn't give up, every time we slow down and go again the mustang would try again. So we just kept beating him. 6 times! 6! then he turn off down some road right after i gave him the thumbs down. That was sooo much fun! 

I left my cool pimp ass thrift store racing jacket at Friday's. Went back to peters house to check out his new s13 coupe. Then JT started lighting me on fire with RC car gas, then i lit him up. Fun tonight. Too bad <i>someone</i> wasnt there."

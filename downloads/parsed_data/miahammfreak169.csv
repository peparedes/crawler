"event","Once a month, for a week, I will be taking an almost absolute hiatus from the internet (I will check my e-mail once a day for e-mails from family/professors/classmates about class; research on the internet is obviously not going to be cut out if I need it for class).

I'm taking a break because I realized that I've been wasting a lot of time on the internet, and I plan on using that week to get caught up on stuff and to just enjoy everything my life has to offer. I can survive without the internet. I plan on also using that time to draw closer to God.

If you need me between the dates, call me or talk to me face to face. If you ABSOLUTELY have to e-mail me, make it apparent in the subject line that it is a matter of extreme importance. 

I realized that if I do this once a month, that's 12 weeks. 12 weeks is about 3 months. 3 months is 25% of the year.&nbsp; That's a ton of time I can invest in a better way.&nbsp; That's 3 more months of time I can devote to serving God.

Do I have exact dates planned out?&nbsp; Not right now.&nbsp; But I may at some point, set dates to be internet-less every month.

This time around, it will be from February 18-24. &nbsp;

Going along with this, I also try to avoid the internet on Sundays, so I can give the whole day to God. &nbsp;

For those on Flickr, I will still be taking pictures for Project 365, just I'll be late in posting them. &nbsp;

Here's to becoming a better person!!!"

"event","&nbsp;<font size=""4"" face=""Teen Light""><p>It truly is amazing how fleeting our memories are, isn&rsquo;t it? Experiences that we <b>know</b> we will remember forever are pushed to the back burner as we continue our day to day existence. Before we know it, those memories are not as vivid as we would like them to be. Some of the details are missing. I can say this so confidently because I know it is true. Just recently, I was working on my testimony, and was looking through my old journal/e-mails to figure out <b>exactly </b>how it happened (I know the gist of it) , and I don&rsquo;t know for sure the exact progression because I didn&rsquo;t write the details down. If I can&rsquo;t even remember the details that led to my salvation, how can I be expected to truly remember anything else? The only events that stay vivid in our minds are recent events. I&rsquo;m not referring to what you had for dinner last night, but things that have happened to you in the recent past. I know this sounds clich&eacute;, but how has this year changed you?</p><p>For me, the year of 2007 has truly been a roller-coaster ride. I&rsquo;ve felt every emotion you can think of. The beginning was extremely rough, but the ending is wonderful. That&rsquo;s <b>always</b> how it is with me--things start out difficult and challenging (in every sense of the word), but end in such an amazing way that it can only be contributed to God. January-May 2007 was the hardest time in my life so far, no doubt about it. I had stuff going wrong all over. There were problems at home, and also in that time frame, I got fired from my first job after only working there three days. When I was at school, my computer broke, and I couldn&rsquo;t use it for the longest time. It was extremely hard to get through the day in one piece at times, let alone keep up with my school work and my friends. Thankfully, though, I had God on my side. If I didn&rsquo;t have Him, I really don&rsquo;t know what I would have done during those dark times. I&rsquo;m not sure if I could even have survived them without His help. God also gave me an <b>amazing</b> group of really loving, supporting friends. They didn&rsquo;t just listen to me--they tried to help in anyway they could, and for that, I am thankful. I truly learned how to depend on God, and that He is indeed faithful. If you asked me in those months if I would be as happy as I am right now, I would have said there was no possible way. There were a lot of tears shed during those months, a lot of confusion, a lot of hurt, and a lot of change (my sister became a pinecone then, so obviously there was change. I mean, sisters don&rsquo;t just change into pinecones without reason. Complete inside joke and no I&rsquo;m not explaining, sorry.) I really don&rsquo;t want to re-live any of what I went through then, but I know I came out of it a stronger person. If you have any doubts or questions about it, shoot me an e-mail and I&rsquo;ll tell you more details, if you don&rsquo;t already know. There is absolutely no way I could have done any of that on my own. I think a note that I wrote on facebook sums it up:</p></font><font size=""5"" face=""Aharoni""><p>&ldquo;</p><p>10:04pm Wednesday, Jul 4 |</p><p>Lamentations 3:19-33 (The Message)<br /><br />I'll never forget the trouble, the utter lostness, <br />the taste of ashes, the poison I've swallowed.<br />I remember it all&mdash;oh, how well I remember&mdash; <br />the feeling of hitting the bottom.<br />But there's one other thing I remember, <br />and remembering, I keep a grip on hope: <br />God's loyal love couldn't have run out, <br />his merciful love couldn't have dried up.<br />They're created new every morning. <br />How great your faithfulness!<br />I'm sticking with God (I say it over and over). <br />He's all I've got left. <br /><br />God proves to be good to the man who passionately waits, <br />to the woman who diligently seeks.<br />It's a good thing to quietly hope, <br />quietly hope for help from God.<br />It's a good thing when you're young <br />to stick it out through the hard times. <br /><br />When life is heavy and hard to take, <br />go off by yourself. Enter the silence.<br />Bow in prayer. Don't ask questions: <br />Wait for hope to appear.<br />Don't run from trouble. Take it full-face. <br />The &quot;worst&quot; is never the worst. <br /><br />Why? Because the Master won't ever <br />walk out and fail to return.<br />If he works severely, he also works tenderly. <br />His stockpiles of loyal love are immense.<br />He takes no pleasure in making life hard, <br />in throwing roadblocks in the way.&quot;<br /><br /><br />That just <b>really</b> stood out today, so I thought I would make a note of it (no pun intended).&rdquo;</p></font><font face=""Teen Light""><font size=""3"">Devotions Highlight </font></font><font size=""4"" face=""Teen Light""><p><br />Basically, in that time period, I had everything that I knew challenged, and eventually, strengthened. I ran to God, and He held me, comforted me, and made me a little bit more like the person He wants me to be.</p><p>June-December 2007 have been completely different. I&rsquo;m not saying that the instant the calendar flipped to June all of my problems went away, but for the most part, they weren&rsquo;t there/as intense as they were prior. God <b>truly </b>blessed me for being obedient through the trials. I started a new year of reading the Bible on August 17. I got a new journal to write it all in, and so far, it has been nothing short of amazing how much God has shown me and how close I&rsquo;ve gotten to God on a day-to-day basis. The complete change of the situations really hit me when I was at Revelation Generation (music festival). The Newsboys were performing, and at that moment, were singing &ldquo;Blessed Be Your Name.&rdquo; I had sung that song soo much during my times of trial, and that time, I was singing it &ldquo;when the sun&rsquo;s shining down on me, when the world&rsquo;s all as it should be.&rdquo; I truly had learned the reason for the song. We can&rsquo;t only praise God when everything is going peachy. Hearing that song when everything was so different was soo refreshing and relieving. I started to cry out of joy because I understood how good God had been to me. I was having the time of my life, something that just a few months earlier, I thought was impossible. As clich&eacute; as it sounds, it was as if a huge weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. I felt free. This past semester, I&rsquo;ve experienced God in countless ways. He is alive and moving. My journal is pretty full of things I&rsquo;ve learned/experienced. It truly is absolutely mind blowing how much God has shown me since the beginning of the semester. There are <b>at least </b>four or five times when I <b>really</b> encountered God, no question about it. I&rsquo;ve learned that there is NO BETTER place than in the presence of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p></font><font face=""Teen Light""><p>How lovely is<br />Your dwelling place<br />Oh Lord Almighty,<br />For my soul longs<br />And even faints<br />For You<br />Oh, here my heart<br />Is satisfied (is satisfied)<br />Within Your presence<br />I sing beneath<br />The shadow of<br />Your wings<br /><br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Better is one day in Your house<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Better is one day in Your house<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br />(Than thousands elsewhere)<br /><br />One thing I ask,<br />And I would seek,<br />To see Your beauty<br />To find You in<br />The place Your glory dwells<br />(One thing I ask)<br />One thing I ask<br />And I would seek,<br />To see Your beauty<br />To find You in<br />The place Your glory dwells<br /><br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Better is one day in Your house<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Better is one day in Your house<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br />(Better is one day)<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Better is one day in Your house<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Better is one day in Your house<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br /><br />(My heart and flesh cry out)<br />My heart and flesh cry out<br />For You, the Living God<br />Your Spirit's water for my soul<br />I've tasted, and I've seen<br />Come once again to me<br />I will draw near to You<br />I will draw near to You<br />To You<br /><br />Better is one day<br />Better is one day<br />Better is one day<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br />(2x)<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Better is one day in Your house<br />Better is one day in Your courts<br />Than thousands elsewhere<br />(4X)<br />Yeah, than thousands elsewhere (Yeah)<br />Oh, than thousands elsewhere<br /><br />&nbsp;</p></font><font size=""4"" face=""Teen Light""><p>In closing, I may not have the best memory, but I know for sure what God has done for me this year.

Sundhage, 47, brings an extensive and impressive resume to the position as both a player and coach, most recently as an assistant for the Chinese National Team during the 2007 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup.<br /><br />Sundhage has been hired to coach the U.S. team through 2008 and the Beijing Olympics, and will begin work immediately on preparation for Olympic qualifying. While final CONCACAF qualifying dates have not yet been announced, it is anticipated the tournament will take place early next year.<br /><br />Sundhage (pronounced Soond-hahg-Eh) coached in the WUSA during all three years of its existence, serving as the top assistant for the Philadelphia Charge during the 2001and 2002 seasons before taking over as head coach of the Boston Breakers in 2003. She led the Breakers, a team that had not made the playoffs in its first two seasons, to the regular season championship and its first playoff berth.<br /><br />&ldquo;Pia is a highly accomplished player and coach with the vision to guide our Women&rsquo;s National Team into this next phase,&rdquo; said Gulati. &ldquo;She brings a fresh perspective and a tremendous amount of experience to the job. She knows the international game and has a great track record of not only winning, but getting the most out of players and teams. We feel that she is a great fit for this team moving forward.&rdquo;<br /><br />One of the most respected coaches in the women&rsquo;s game and widely regarded as one of the world&rsquo;s all-time greatest female players during her international career that spanned 22 years, Sundhage becomes the sixth head coach in the history of a program that has compiled a record of 303-51-44 since its inception in 1985. She is the first foreign coach to take the helm of the U.S. team and second woman. This will not be her first assignment for U.S. Soccer. Sundhage served as a scout for the USA during the 2004 Olympics.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course, I am very excited and happy that I have this opportunity,&rdquo; said Sundhage. &ldquo;I see myself as being a part of a group that wants to be challenged. In order to be successful, I do think it is important that the coaching staff and the players know that we create our own environment. We are the environment that brings out the best performances in each other. In coaching, it&rsquo;s about communication, so feedback is important and that is something that will help improve our team as we develop the way we will play.&rdquo;<br /><br />Sundhage started her coaching career while still playing, serving as player-coach for the Hammarby club from 1992-1994. She also coached Sweden&rsquo;s Youth National Teams for 11 years from 1990-2001, coaching the U-16s, the U-19s and U-21s. After her retirement from the international game in 1996, she became head coach of the Sweden Under-19 Women&rsquo;s National Team, leading the team to one gold medal and two bronze medals at the European Championships. She has also served as a scout for Sweden during the 1997 European Championships, the 1999 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup, the 2003 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup and the 2000 Olympics. Sundhage has also worked for FIFA on its Technical Study Group staff for the 2004 FIFA U-20 Women&rsquo;s World Championship in Thailand.<br /><br />&ldquo;When I started playing, I played with boys, and I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to play because I was a girl,&rdquo; said Sundhage. &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s soccer has evolved to the point where I played in the 1996 Olympics and 12 years later, I get this huge opportunity. It is a unique moment in many aspects, including U.S. Soccer hiring a foreigner. It takes brave people to make a change. If you want to make changes you have to be brave and like the situation, which I certainly do, moving to the USA to take on this responsibility and challenge while getting the chance to coach some of the best players in the world. I like that feeling.&rdquo;<br /><br />Sundhage played for a number of clubs in Sweden as her role on the field evolved over the years, although she played mostly as a forward, before moving to midfielder and then to sweeper. She started her club soccer career at age 11 with the women&rsquo;s club Ulricehamn, as there were no girls teams at that time, playing with women as old as 30. <br /><br />She then played with Falkoping KIK before moving to Jitex BK of Gothenburg where she played during three different stints in the 1980s. She won the Swedish Cup four times, twice with Jitex BK and twice with Hammarby, and the won the league title four times with Jitex BK. While playing with Osters in 1982 and 1983, she led the league in scoring with 30 and 35 goals, respectively. She had a brief stint with Lazio in Italy in 1985, helping the club to a second place finish in the league as she scored 17 goals. She played at Hammarby in 1986, then back to Jitex from 1987-89, but moved to Stockholm when she got the job with the Sweden Federation, and played at Hammarby from 1990-96. <br /><br />After the WUSA ceased operations, Sundhage coached for one year in Norway at Kolbotn, one of that country&rsquo;s top clubs, before returning to her native Sweden where she coached KIF Orebro in Sweden&rsquo;s top division for two and half years. For several months in the spring 2005, U.S. veterans Kristine Lilly and Kate Markgraf, who played for her on the Breakers, played for her at Orebro. <br /><br />A legendary player in Sweden, she played for her country in the 1991 and 1995 Women&rsquo;s World Cups, and 1996 Olympics. She scored four goals for Sweden at the 1991 Women&rsquo;s World Cup, helping the Swedes to a third-place finish. She scored one goal in the 1995 Women&rsquo;s World Cup (against Germany) and played every minute of all three matches at the Atlanta Olympics.<br /><br />She captained the national team for many years, playing 146 international games while scoring 71 goals, for years a record until recently matched by Sweden&rsquo;s star forward Hanna Ljungberg. She debuted for Sweden at age 15 in 1975 against Finland and ended her 22-year international career at the 1996 Olympics in a win over Denmark. Sundhage led Sweden to the first European Women&rsquo;s Championship in 1984, scoring the winning penalty kick against England to give her country to its only European title. She also helped Sweden to two silver medal finishes and one bronze at the European Women&rsquo;s Championships.<br /><br />During her international career, Sundhage played against the United States numerous times, including matches at the 1991 Women&rsquo;s World Cup and in the 1996 Olympics. In 2000, she finished sixth in the voting for FIFA Women&rsquo;s Player of the Century.<br /><br />An accomplished guitar player and talented singer, Sundhage&rsquo;s fame in Sweden reached new levels in the mid-1980s when her image was put on a postage stamp. A true women&rsquo;s soccer pioneer who finished her schooling in the 1970s when European women&rsquo;s soccer was still in its infancy, she held a variety of jobs, including working at a car wash and as a secretary before embarking on her prolific career in soccer. She holds the highest level of coaching license in Sweden.<br /><br />Sundhage&rsquo;s first games as head coach will come in January at the Four Nations Tournament in China, ironically the country she recently left after helping the 2007 Women&rsquo;s World Cup hosts to the quarterfinals. With the Chinese National Team, Sundhage worked with then-head coach Marika Domanski-Lyfors, who was also Sweden&rsquo;s head coach for years, including the entire time Sundhage coached the Sweden Youth National Teams. Dates and venues for the Four Nations have yet to be confirmed.<br /><br />Sundhage is actually the fourth foreign-born coach in U.S. Women's National Team history, after the team's first coach Mike Ryan (who was born in Ireland but relocated to the United States in 1958 at age 23), Anson Dorrance (born in India) and Greg Ryan (born in Germany).<br /><br />The U.S. Women&rsquo;s National Team has won four world championships &ndash; two Women&rsquo;s World Cup and two Olympics -- and finished in the top three in all eight women&rsquo;s world championships staged by FIFA since the inaugural Women&rsquo;s World Cup in 1991, the only team in the world to medal in every tournament.</div></td> 		</tr>                 <tr>                    <td valign=""top""><img width=""1"" height=""6"" src=""http://www.ussoccer.com/images/red/spacer.gif"" alt="""" /></td>                 </tr>                 <tr>                    <td valign=""top""><img width=""1"" height=""6"" src=""http://www.ussoccer.com/images/red/spacer.gif"" alt="""" /></td>                 </tr>                 <tr>                    <td valign=""top""><img width=""1"" height=""6"" src=""http://www.ussoccer.com/images/red/spacer.gif"" alt="""" /></td>                 </tr>		 		 		<tr align=""center""> 		<td class=""bodytext_italic"">ussoccer.com is the official website of U.S. Soccer, the governing body of soccer in the United States</td></tr></tbody></table>"

In this case, after looking closely at the last six weeks and the team's performance at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, we have made a decision to change leadership of the U.S. Women&rsquo;s National Team. I want to thank Greg Ryan and his staff for their work over the last two-plus years. We look forward to the continued development of our National Team as one of the best in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>The decision was made after a review of the team's third-place finish at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China. Ryan finishes his career with an official record of 45-1-9, after originally joining the team as head coach in January, 2005. Ryan also served as an assistant coach for the team in 2004.</p><p>The search will be led by a three-person committee made up of Gulati, U.S. Soccer Secretary General Dan Flynn and Hall of Fame Women&rsquo;s National Team forward Mia Hamm. An announcement on the new coach is expected in the next 30 to 45 days.</p><p>The U.S. team will return to training in January and will play a full schedule of domestic and international games in preparation for qualifying for the 2008 Olympic Women&rsquo;s Soccer Tournament in Beijing, China.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td valign=""top""><img width=""1"" height=""6"" src=""http://www.ussoccer.com/images/red/spacer.gif"" alt="""" /></td></tr><tr><td valign=""top""><img width=""1"" height=""6"" src=""http://www.ussoccer.com/images/red/spacer.gif"" alt="""" /></td></tr><tr><td valign=""top""><img width=""1"" height=""6"" src=""http://www.ussoccer.com/images/red/spacer.gif"" alt="""" /></td></tr><tr align=""center""><td class=""bodytext_italic"">ussoccer.com is the official website of U.S. Soccer, the governing body of soccer in the United States</td></tr></tbody></table><script type=""text/javascript"">

I'm taking a break because I realized that I've been wasting a lot of time on the internet, and I plan on using that week to get caught up on stuff and to just enjoy everything my life has to offer.&nbsp; I can survive without the internet.&nbsp; I plan on also using that time to draw closer to God.

The U.S. was forced to chase the rest of the game against the dynamic and talented Brazilians who scored twice in both halves to defeat the USA, 4-0.<br /><br />The USA will face Norway for third place on Sunday, Sept. 30, at Shanghai Hongkou Football Stadium. The match will be broadcast live on ESPN2 at 4:55 a.m. ET. The USA also played in the third-place match of the 2003 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup, defeating Canada, 3-1.<br /><br />In front of a thunderous crowd of almost 50,000 fans and on a steamy hot night, the USA started well, getting a shot from Kristine Lilly just 15 seconds into the match that forced a dive from Brazilian goalkeeper Andreia. Boxx had a header off a free kick that she directed on net in the sixth minute, but once again Andreia saved it with a dive.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes of the game saw clattering fouls from both teams, leading to free kicks in dangerous spots. Brazil forced some early pressure as well, hitting a free kick in the seventh minute that was deflected by U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry, off a Brazilian player and out of bounds.<br /><br />The USA gifted Brazil its first goal in the 20th minute, coming off a corner kick that was spun to the near post. With no Brazilian players close to getting a touch on it, it skidded off the turf as midfielder Leslie Osborne dove to clear it, but instead inadvertently headed the ball into her own net from close range.<br /><br />The second Brazil goal came seven minutes later on a piece of magical dribbling from Brazilian star Marta, who won a ball from defender Stephanie Lopez down the right flank. She dribbled inside and darted free, shooting between closing U.S. defenders Kate Markgraf and Cat Whitehill. Scurry got a hand on the ball, but couldn&rsquo;t turn it outside the right post.<br /><br />The USA fought back, as Lilly bent a free kick from outside the penalty box on the right side that almost flew into the upper left corner of the goal and barely missed two crashing U.S. players.<br /><br />Then disaster struck in stoppage time of the first half.<br /><br />Boxx had received an early yellow card in the 15th minute for upending a Brazilian player and was caught chasing a Brazilian counter attack in the 46th minute. Brazilian forward Cristiane bumped Boxx from behind, got tangled in her legs and both went down in a heap. In a harsh decision by referee Nicole Petignat, she whistled the foul, pulled out a second yellow, then red and sent Boxx to the locker room.<br /><br />U.S. head coach Greg Ryan inserted Carli Lloyd for Lopez at halftime as the USA went to a 3-4-2 formation, but against the talented Brazilians and playing a woman down, the Americans faced a daunting task to get back in the game.<br /><br />&ldquo;It was a very difficult game for us tonight,&rdquo; said Ryan. &ldquo;I want to congratulate my players&hellip;I am very proud of the effort that they put in tonight. The game didn&rsquo;t go our way, but I&rsquo;m very proud of all of our young women who put in the last two-to-three years of their commitment, time, dedication, to come out and give their best tonight. To say that, this game is one game, and it&rsquo;s over now, and we&rsquo;re moving on to prepare for our game against Norway.&rdquo; (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ussoccer.com/articles/viewArticle.jsp_2555913.html"">More Quotes</a>)<br /><br />With the 2-0 lead and up a player, Brazil possessed the ball and created counter attacks. After midfielder Maycon had two close calls in the 50th and 52nd minutes, skidding shots just past the post, it seemed that Brazil might get another, and they did, scoring the third goal in the 56th minute.<br /><br />Renata Costa got free down the left flank on the counter attack and played a square pass to a wide open Cristiane in the middle of the penalty area. She slotted into the left corner from 12 yards out, giving Scurry no chance.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we were surprised, we knew what they were going to do,&rdquo; said Lilly. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t start off the way we wanted to. They were beating us to the ball most of the time and I think they had the momentum going their way. The first goal was a fluke, then Marta scored a good goal, and then we are down a man and we are just trying to keep our heads above water. The team fought to the end and Brazil was the better team today.&rdquo;<br /><br />After giving up the two first half goals and losing Boxx, the Americans tried to mount some offense in the second half, but the energetic and extremely quick Brazilian side was up to the task.<br /><br />Lilly had a strike at goal in the 63rd minute as Lori Chalupny toe-poked a ball free after Abby Wambach nodded a free kick down with her head, but she shot straight at the Brazilian &lsquo;keeper. Lloyd did get a chance from distance in 54th, but fired wide left. Andreia also had to punch away a high shot from Wambach in the 69th minute. <br /><br />The end of the game belonged to Marta, who put on a dazzling display of dribbling and scored the capper in the 80th minute. She took a chipped pass from Renata Costa in the left side of the penalty box with her back to the goal, flicked the bouncing ball around substitute Tina Ellertson to the inside, ran around her to the outside, then cut inside to evade Whitehill before hitting her shot into the lower left corner. Once again Scurry got a glove to it, but couldn&rsquo;t turn it away. The two goals gave Marta a tournament-leading seven in the 2007 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup.<br /><br />Markgraf had to leave the game in the 74th minute after injuring her ankle a few minutes earlier, allowing defender Marian Dalmy to make her Women&rsquo;s World Cup debut.<br /><br />It was the first loss in regulation time for the U.S. women in the past 51 games and first-ever loss under Ryan. The four-goal deficit also marked the biggest margin of defeat in U.S. history.<br /><br /> <div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM GAME REPORT</span></div> <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Match-up:</span>	USA vs. Brazil<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Competition</span>:  	2007 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup &ndash; Semifinal<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Venue</span>:           	Hangzhou Dragon Stadium &ndash; Hangzhou, China<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Date</span>:             	Sept. 27, 2007; Kickoff &ndash; 8 p.m. local / 8 a.m. ET<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Attendance</span>:	47,818 <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Weather:	</span>Hot, humid &ndash; 84 degrees<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Scoring Summary: 	 </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            	1&nbsp;&nbsp;    	2&nbsp;&nbsp; 	F <br />USA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      0 &nbsp;	0&nbsp;&nbsp;	0<br />BRA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	2&nbsp;&nbsp;	2&nbsp;&nbsp;	4<br /><br />BRA &ndash; Own Goal (Leslie Osborne)	20th minute<br />BRA &ndash; Marta (unassisted)		27.<br />BRA &ndash; Cristiane (Renata Costa)		56.<br />BRA &ndash; Marta (Renata Costa)		80.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Lineups</span>: <br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">USA</span>: 1-Briana Scurry; 3-Christie Rampone, 15-Kate Markgraf (2-Marian Dalmy, 74), 4-Cat Whitehill, 14-Stephanie Lopez (11-Carli Lloyd, 46); 7-Shannon Boxx, 12-Leslie Osborne, 17-Lori Chalupny; 9-Heather O&rsquo;Reilly (8-Tina Ellertson, 60), 20-Abby Wambach, 13-Kristine Lilly &ndash; Capt.<br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Subs not used: 5-Lindsay Tarpley, 6-Natasha Kai, 10-Aly Wagner, 16-Angela Hucles, 18-Hope Solo 19-Marci Jobson, 21-Nicole Barnhart.</span><br /><br />Head Coach: Greg Ryan <br /><br />BRA: 1-Andreia; 2-Elaine, 3-Aline &ndash; Capt., 4-Tania, 5-Renata Costa, 7-Daniela, 8-Formiga, 9-Maycon, 20-Ester; 10-Marta, 11-Cristiane. <br /><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Subs not used: 6-Rosana, 12-Barbara, 13-Monica, 14-Grazielle, 15-Katia, 16-Simone, 17-Daiane, 18-Pretinha, 19-Michele, 21-Thais</span><br /><br />Head Coach: Jorge Barcellos<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Statistical Summary: 	      </span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USA / BRA</span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Shots</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 / 19<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Shots on Goal:</span> 4 / 8<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Saves</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 / 4   <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Corner Kicks:</span>&nbsp; 2 / 4<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fouls</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 / 15 <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Offside</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 / 0<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Misconduct Summary:  </span><br />USA &ndash; Shannon Boxx (caution)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		14th minute.<br />USA &ndash; Lori Chalupny (caution)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		26.<br />BRA &ndash; Aline (caution)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28.<br />BRA &ndash; Renata Costa (caution)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		44.<br />USA &ndash; Shannon Boxx (caution)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		46+<br />USA&mdash;Shannon Boxx (ejection)&nbsp;&nbsp;		46+<br />USA &ndash; Abby Wambach (caution)&nbsp;		49.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Officials</span>: <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Referee</span>:	Nicole Petignat (SUI) <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asst.

/></b><i>Opening statement: <br /></i>&ldquo;First, I would like to congratulate Brazil for playing a great game tonight. They have great skill and great team play. I think if we could look at where these young women have come from, where they have developed with very little in their country and how they have come so far in their own personal development, this is a great achievement for them.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It was a very difficult game for us tonight. I want to congratulate my players because I think this was the 51st game, that they had gone without a loss until tonight. I am very proud of the effort that they put in tonight. The game didn&rsquo;t go our way, but I&rsquo;m very proud of all of our young women who put in the last two-to-three years of their commitment, time, dedication, to come out and give their best tonight. To say that, this game is one game, and it&rsquo;s over now, and we&rsquo;re moving on to prepare for our game against Norway, another very important match for our team.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On the effect on the game of Boxx&rsquo;s red card: <br /></i>&ldquo;Shannon Boxx getting sent off so early in the game completely changes the game. When you are a man short against a team that plays so well as Brazil, it&rsquo;s very difficult. In terms of our adjustments, we played in a 3-4-2 to try and still attack, but try and keep Brazil from getting more which would end the game, which is what ended up happening.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On Briana Scurry&rsquo;s play in goal: <br /></i>&ldquo;In terms of having Briana start tonight, I don&rsquo;t have any regrets about that. I think Bri played a great game. The one goal that Marta scored was a great goal. It comes off her foot so quick. We had two players on Marta when she hit that thing, and she&rsquo;s just a great player and she scored a great goal. I think Briana in that situation gives us the best chance to save that shot because of her quickness and speed. I know she got hands to the ball and did everything that she could to save that, and if you look at the rest of the match there&rsquo;s nothing she could have done about any of the other goals. I&rsquo;m very happy with how Briana stood in there tonight. When we were having to attack even when we were a man short, she was saving us at the other end, trying to give us a chance to get back in the game.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On the second sub, Ellertson for O&rsquo;Reilly: <br /></i>&ldquo;At one point we brought Tina on to defend Marta and I thought she did a very good job. We tried to push Christie Rampone up the field because she is not only good at defending, but attacking going the other way. They were getting behind us in that space so we moved Christie into and they were getting in up our right side through Maicon their left midfielder. That was the reason for that sub.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On the third sub, Dalmy for Markgraf: <br /></i>&ldquo;The other sub was Kate Markgraf, who had a sprained ankle which she got maybe in the 70th minute and she actually couldn&rsquo;t run anymore. She was doing the best she could. At that point we brought in Marian Dalmy and we had to bring Christie back to defend again because Kate couldn&rsquo;t go on.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On Hope Solo: <br /></i>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t talked to Hope after the game, but we spent some time together sitting down and talking about things today, and just telling her that she&rsquo;s done great in this World Cup. She&rsquo;s got four games under her belt without a loss. She&rsquo;s a young, very talented &lsquo;keeper who will, I&rsquo;m sure, lead this team many years into the future. I&rsquo;m very proud of how she&rsquo;s played and she will continue to play in the goal for this team down the road.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On if Brazil has surpassed the U.S. program: <br /></i>&ldquo;In terms of talent, Brazil has some wonderfully talented players. You look at Marta and Cristiane and they&rsquo;re very exceptional players. And the rest of the players are very skillful, and can play well together also. First, we want to give them great credit for having so much talent in their team. In terms of the U.S.&rsquo;s ability to continue to compete against these teams, we need to continue to develop our talent so that we can develop players from our youth like Marta, like Cristiane. But I think we have some great players coming up, I think you can&rsquo;t draw too many conclusions from tonight&rsquo;s game because at the point we were down 2-0, I believe they only had one shot on goal. So, in terms of the organization, things were actually going well up to that point. But any time you give up an own goal early and then Marta is just fantastic in terms of getting a shot off against two closing defenders, and then a sending off, then it&rsquo;s easy to say Brazil looked great. We had to chase them around the park for the last 45 minutes with 10 players.&rdquo; <br /><br /><b>U.S. forward KRISTINE LILLY: <br /></b><i>On Brazil: <br /></i>&quot;I don't think we were surprised. We knew what they were going to do. We just didn't start off the way we wanted to. They were beating us to the ball most of the time and I think that had the momentum going their way. The first goal is a fluke, then Marta scored a good goal, and then we are down a man and we are just trying to keep our heads above water. The team fought to the end and Brazil was the better team today.&quot; <br /><br /><i>On if the goalkeeper change affected the team: <br /></i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. It&rsquo;s a game out there. With everyone on the field, it wasn&rsquo;t about anything like that. It was a game that we came up short in, and if you look at it like that it was Brazil&rsquo;s day and not the USA&rsquo;s.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On her future: <br /></i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another game on Sunday, so that&rsquo;s the one I am looking forward to the most right now. With a team like this you come into a semi and come up short you have one more game left to end on a win in a big tournament like this. The U.S. will come back on Sunday and make the country proud.&rdquo; <br /><br /><b>U.S. defender CHRISTIE RAMPONE: <br /></b><i>On how a team like Brazil can be stopped: <br /></i>&ldquo;We just have to contain them and try to drive them the opposite way. With a man down, we went to man-to-man and they just spread the field out on us and just ran us all over.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On the impact of playing a man down: <br /></i>&ldquo;You have to change your game plan when you are a man down. We tried to settle the ball a little bit and play with more confidence. We were on our heels a little bit and that wasn&rsquo;t working, so we tried hitting it a little bit longer and trying to get in their end. It&rsquo;s tough to play a man down but I think we battled, but today wasn&rsquo;t our day.&rdquo; <br /><br /><b>U.S. goalkeeper BRIANA SCURRY <br /></b><i>On Brazil: <br /></i>&ldquo;Their players are more individually skilled as a team than any other team out there. You really have to work hard on defense against them, and you have to try to keep them as contained as you can and that&rsquo;s tough to do without 11 people.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On the own goal: <br /></i>&ldquo;I would have gotten it had it gone past her, but I mean Leslie, that&rsquo;s her area. Leslie&rsquo;s going to try to get that ball no matter what and it&rsquo;s not her fault. She was making her effort like she is supposed to and unfortunately it was just right in front of the post. It is my job to call her out of there, but once she&rsquo;s going it&rsquo;s tough to get a person to stop in the middle.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On Marta&rsquo;s first goal: <br /></i>&ldquo;I think if maybe I had come off my line a little more. Obviously when I got the touch it would have gone around the post. It&rsquo;s tough to say with Marta because she&rsquo;s so skilled, if I hug the near post too much she goes far post, and if I hug the far post too much she goes near. She is an incredibly skilled player and she put it, unfortunately, just out of my reach.&rdquo; <br /><br /><b>U.S. forward ABBY WAMBACH <br /></b><i>On the game: <br /></i>&ldquo;This is difficult because when you go down a man against a team as good as Brazil, they are going to take advantage of you. When we are trying to push forward and get those goals back, they are going to take advantage of you in the moment&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re getting forward. The fact that it was 4-0 doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. They won, we lost. That&rsquo;s the way I look at this game. It was a much different game when we had 11 on the field. A fluke goal, the first goal, and after that it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s game. When the referee calls red card on Shannon Boxx, her second yellow for a red, it changes the whole course of the game. I&rsquo;m not going to sit here and make excuses because we could have come out stronger, but today was Brazil&rsquo;s day and I&rsquo;m heartbroken.&rdquo; <br /><br /><i>On Brazil&rsquo;s improvement: <br /></i>&ldquo;Brazil has really amazing individual soccer players on that team and today they played like a team.

"event","<p>I know that I haven't been posting in here a lot, but here is a short summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />School is going well.&nbsp; At times, it is a lot of work, but I honestly feel that I'm getting better at managing my time.&nbsp; Even since last year, my time management has gotten so much better.&nbsp; It's great because I can fit a ton of stuff into my days now.<br /><br />SCF is going amazingly well.&nbsp; At our first Tuesday meeting, we had 40 people there! FORTY!&nbsp; It was amazing, and definitely all because of God.&nbsp; It's going to be a great year, because I truly feel that God has some amazing stuff in store for us as a group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm planning on going to a mission trip over spring break to Exuma (in the Bahamas) with this group.&nbsp; I'm so excited; I wish spring break would come already, but I know that this time is important too--a time of preparation.&nbsp; I was thinking about it the other day, and I'm so glad that I can continue my mission trips through college.&nbsp; I doubt if I can take any more with the BYF.&nbsp; It's not because of the fact that I graduated, because Hep, Cassie, and Mindy went to MS,&nbsp;but because I couldn't be there during the months of preparation and such due to school.&nbsp; I wouldn't be able to help fundraise, I wouldn't be around for &quot;team building&quot; stuff during the year, and just stuff like that.&nbsp; So again, I'm extremely glad that I can do mission trips with SCF during college.&nbsp; I couldn't go last year, but I'm going this year, and hopefully, every year after, that is, if God wants me to go every year.&nbsp; I'm also trying to start up a ladies' Bible study for SCF, since the guys already have their Man night.&nbsp; It's exciting and yet a bit overwhelming being in charge of it.&nbsp; I've never done anything like this (start and lead a Bible study), so&nbsp; you can bet I've been praying about it.&nbsp; My devotions have been amazingly amazingly awesome lately--I'm truly learning so much!&nbsp; I just can't wait to see what God has in store for this whole year!<br /><br />Work is good.&nbsp; I have the best job ever, honestly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of work, I have to go soon for work.&nbsp; I'll try to update this again in the near future.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>Predictions I made on the 10th:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Groups and Standings <br />Group A <br />&nbsp; Team&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Germany <br />&nbsp; England&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Japan <br />&nbsp; Argentina&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, Germany is the favorite in this group. The 11-0 game against Argentina proves two things: that Germany is really good, while Argentina is really bad. This is nothing new, however. <br />Group B <br />&nbsp; Team <br />&nbsp; Sweden <br />&nbsp; USA <br />&nbsp; Nigeria <br />&nbsp; Korea DPR</p><p>I have my bias (USA!) but we can&rsquo;t automatically count out Sweden and North Korea&mdash;they are both really good teams. But I really think that the US is playing some amazing soccer right now, and will come out victorious for their group.

I must admit, I am slightly dissapointed with the US team since they let in two goals in the 10 minutes that Abby was off the field.&nbsp; One player leaving shouldn't create such&nbsp; a difference.&nbsp; They should not be relying on Abby, or anyone--soccer is a team sport.&nbsp; That didn't come out well, but the gist is--there is no reason 2 goals in 10 minutes should have been allowed.&nbsp; Sweden will be as hard as North Korea, or even harder---they are currently ranked third.&nbsp; There is a slight advantage there--the US has played Sweden more than North Korea and also Sweden isn't secretive, so they are not hard to scout.&nbsp; It is going to be a tough game, for sure.&nbsp; And the group ends with Nigeria, a really tough team, in regards to physical play.&nbsp; The Nigerians love to foul and create a very physical game.&nbsp; Normally, I wouldn't be concerned about Nigeria, but since they tied Sweden yesterday, I'm concerned.&nbsp; Obviously they have stepped their game up tremendously.&nbsp; The game Friday against Sweden will be VERY critical.&nbsp; On the other hand, I'm happy Nigeria tied Sweden, because it didn't create a definite leader in the group--it still is anyone's game.&nbsp; =)</p><p><br />That being said, GO USA!!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Her 97.16% surpassed that of the previous high vote garnered by Michelle Akers in 2005, who was elected with 95.77% of the vote. Foudy was elected with 83.69 percent of the vote, having been selected on 118 ballots. The U.S. Women&rsquo;s National Team won more than 80 percent of its games and four world championships during the era in which the two played.</p><p>Carla Overbeck, the captain of the 1999 Women&rsquo;s World Cup champions, herself a Hall of Fame inductee last year, will present Foudy. Former U.S. National Team and long-time University of North Carolina head coach Anson Dorrance will present Hamm.</p><p>Hamm and Foudy, who have earned induction on the first ballot for which they were eligible, both played their final games for the USA during the last match of the 2004 Fan Celebration Tour to commemorate the U.S. WNT&rsquo;s memorable victory at the 2004 Olympics. The 5-0 win over Mexico on Dec. 8, 2004, capped off historic careers that saw them win two Women&rsquo;s World Cup titles and two Olympic gold medals, as well as lead a generation of players who were at the center of groundbreaking achievements in women&rsquo;s sports. The emotional run to the 2004 Olympic gold medal in Greece was the final world championship for the duo.</p><p>During Hamm&rsquo;s 18 years on the U.S. National Team she became perhaps the most recognizable and admired women&rsquo;s soccer player in the world. Her goal scoring feats were legendary as she struck for a world-record 158 international goals, a mark that still stands to this day and likely will for years to come. Her 144 career assists are also a U.S. record, and she played 275 international matches, second only in history to former teammate Kristine Lilly. A native of Selma, Alabama, Hamm played her youth soccer in Texas and Virginia before being spotted by then U.S. head coach Anson Dorrance. Hamm became the youngest woman ever to ever play with the U.S. National team when she debuted at the age of 15. Hamm won four NCAA titles at the University of North Carolina, leading the nation in scoring three times and ended her collegiate career as the ACC&rsquo;s all-time leading scorer in goals (103), assists (72) and points (278). She received the prestigious Honda-Broderick Award as the nation&rsquo;s outstanding female collegiate athlete two consecutive years and was named U.S. Soccer&rsquo;s Female Athlete of the Year five consecutive years (1994-1998). She played three years in the WUSA, leading the Washington Freedom to the championship in 2003. She was also named FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Player of Year twice (2001-2002). Hamm achieved iconic status for the thousands of girls who play soccer across the USA and in 1999 was honored by Nike when the company named the largest building on its campus at the World Headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, after her. She also wrote a best-selling book titled, &ldquo;Go for the Goal &ndash; A Champion&rsquo;s Guide to Winning in Soccer and Life.&rdquo;</p><p>Foudy, who captained the USA from the time of Carla Overbeck&rsquo;s retirement in 2000 to her own in 2004, is one of the greatest leaders in the history of women&rsquo;s sports. On the field, she was known for her competitive fire, phenomenal work rate and smooth skills on the ball. She played 271 times for the USA, third behind Lilly and Hamm, while scoring 45 goals from the midfield, good for ninth on the all-time U.S. scoring list. A southern California native, she started in all seven world championships in which she played, playing every single match, including the 2004 Olympic final when she went the distance on a badly sprained ankle. A four-time All-American at Stanford University, she finished her college career with 52 goals and 32 assists. Off the field, Foudy is one of the most influential female athletes in the United States. She took over as the president of the Women's Sports Foundation following the 2000 Olympics and finished her term at the end of 2002. She was named to a Presidential Commission on Title IX in 2002 and played a major role stopping any major changes to the law. She was also placed atop the list of Most Powerful Women in sports by The Sporting News in their 2003 and broke new ground with her work as an in studio analyst for ESPN and ABC&rsquo;s coverage of the 1998 and 2006 World Cups. Foudy, who played three seasons in the WUSA for the San Diego Spirit, won the 1997 FIFA Fair Play Award for her work against child labor. She was the first woman and thus far the only American to win the award.</p><p><strong>Mia Hamm Career Highlights</strong></p><ul><li>Debuted for the U.S. Women&rsquo;s National Team at the age of 15 years, 140 days, on Aug. 3, 1987 vs. China.</li><li>Started her first Women&rsquo;s World Cup match on Nov. 17, 1991, against Sweden, and scored, in the 3-2 victory.</li><li>In 1994, she was named U.S. Soccer's Female Athlete of the Year for the first of what would be an unprecedented five consecutive years from 1994 1998.</li><li>Became the only non-goalkeeper to ever play in goal during a Women&rsquo;s World Cup when she played the last five minutes against Denmark on June 8, 1995, after Briana Scurry was ejected and the USA was out of substitutes.

"event","<p>but I really don't care at the moment.&nbsp; Get comfy, this has the potential to be insanely long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I actually don't really even know how to start.&nbsp; SOO much is going through my head.&nbsp; If this entry isn't entirely coherent, please forgive me.</p><p>On the 28th, as I was doing my devotions, I had a feeling that I would be getting a lot out of the reading.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my notes from my reading:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&quot;1 Timothy 2:1-10&nbsp;(The Message)</h3><h3>Simple Faith and Plain Truth</h3><div class=""result-text-style-normal"">&nbsp;The first thing I want you to do is pray. Pray every way you know how, for everyone you know. Pray especially for rulers and their governments to rule well so we can be quietly about our business of living simply, in humble contemplation. This is the way our Savior God wants us to live.</div><p class=""result-text-style-normal"">&nbsp;He wants not only us but everyone saved, you know, everyone to get to know the truth we've learned: that there's one God and only one, and one Priest-Mediator between God and us&mdash;Jesus, who offered himself in exchange for everyone held captive by sin, to set them all free. Eventually the news is going to get out. This and this only has been my appointed work: getting this news to those who have never heard of God, and explaining how it works by simple faith and plain truth.</p><p class=""result-text-style-normal"">&nbsp;Since prayer is at the bottom of all this, what I want mostly is for men to pray&mdash;not shaking angry fists at enemies but raising holy hands to God. And I want women to get in there with the men in humility before God, not primping before a mirror or chasing the latest fashions but doing something beautiful for God and becoming beautiful doing it.&quot;</p><p class=""result-text-style-normal""><br />Thoughts I had (list, than explanation):</p><div class=""result-text-style-normal""><ul><li>Live in bubble (predictable, etc.)</li><li>&quot;believing in God&quot; vs &quot;following Christ&quot;</li><li>read Bible/journal/pray a little; very little action</li><li>&quot;just do it&quot;</li><li>actions-not for glory of others, but still gives self-satisfaction; so how can die to self in that aspect?</li><li>b/c that could lead to pride even if it is hidden</li><li>if die to self completely will self-satisfaction go away (self-confidence/self-esteem)?</li><li>motives-self-satisfaction might not be primary but def. comes afterwards</li><li>want 2 grow closer to God but not sure how (read, pray, do, etc.) but have done those and don't feel close (but shouldn't be based on feelings)--&gt;need to fix eyes on Jesus and Jesus alone--dedicated--loyal--die to self-change motives-what can i get out of it--&gt;what can or will God show me thru this? has it happened in my life? how can God use me with this understanding?</li><li>dying to self--college-job-my opinion, what i wanted</li><li>can't ignore school/work to just focus on God--need balance but not sure how.&quot;</li></ul></div><p>Then today I had another good time:</p><p>Lamentations 3:19-33 (The Message)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'll never forget the trouble, the utter lostness, <br />the taste of ashes, the poison I've swallowed.<br />I remember it all&mdash;oh, how well I remember&mdash; <br />the feeling of hitting the bottom.<br />But there's one other thing I remember, <br />and remembering, I keep a grip on hope: <br />God's loyal love couldn't have run out, <br />his merciful love couldn't have dried up.<br />They're created new every morning. <br />How great your faithfulness!<br />I'm sticking with God (I say it over and over). <br />He's all I've got left. <br /><br />God proves to be good to the man who passionately waits, <br />to the woman who diligently seeks.<br />It's a good thing to quietly hope, <br />quietly hope for help from God.<br />It's a good thing when you're young <br />to stick it out through the hard times. <br /><br />When life is heavy and hard to take, <br />go off by yourself. Enter the silence.<br />Bow in prayer. Don't ask questions: <br />Wait for hope to appear.<br />Don't run from trouble. Take it full-face. <br />The &quot;worst&quot; is never the worst. <br /><br />Why? Because the Master won't ever <br />walk out and fail to return.<br />If he works severely, he also works tenderly. <br />His stockpiles of loyal love are immense.<br />He takes no pleasure in making life hard, <br />in throwing roadblocks in the way.&quot;</p><p>and .....................</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&quot;1 Timothy 4:6-10&nbsp;(The Message)</h3><div class=""result-text-style-normal""><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;You've been raised on the Message of the faith and have followed sound teaching. Now pass on this counsel to the followers of Jesus there, and you'll be a good servant of Jesus. Stay clear of silly stories that get dressed up as religion. Exercise daily in God&mdash;no spiritual flabbiness, please! Workouts in the gymnasium are useful, but a disciplined life in God is far more so, making you fit both today and forever. You can count on this. Take it to heart. This is why we've thrown ourselves into this venture so totally. We're banking on the living God, Savior of all men and women, especially believers. &quot;</p><p>Okay, let me try to explain&nbsp; now.&nbsp; A MAJOR thing that has come up time and time and time and time again in my devotions is the concept of dying to self.&nbsp; I know it is an extremely hard concept to fully grasp, but I figure that if I even only partially understand the lessons now, maybe eventually I'll actually understand what it truly means.&nbsp;</p><p>In Ecclesiastes, it says to honor (serve) God while you are still young.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like to think that I'm serving God, but in all honesty, I probably am not.&nbsp; My life is, for the most part, insanely predictable.&nbsp; I wake up, have breakfast, take a shower, go to work at some point, read e-mails, try to do my devotions, maybe just chill (read or tv), go to bed, and do the same thing the next day.&nbsp; I know &quot;serving God&quot; doesn't have to be an organized outreach or something like that, but my day is centered around myself, not God.&nbsp; My motivation for working is to make money for myself.&nbsp; I read my e-mails because they are FOR me.&nbsp; When I relax, it is because I want to.&nbsp; So how is any of that serving God?&nbsp; It isn't.&nbsp; I know why Ecclesiastes&nbsp; says to serve God in&nbsp; your youth--because youth have energy, passion, and confidence.&nbsp; I don't want to grow up and years from now, look at this time in my life with regrets because I just sat on my butt and didn't do squat for God.&nbsp; I know some of you (or at least one of you :p) is thinking about Mississippi, because that was obviously serving God.&nbsp; But Mississippi, as amazing as it was, was only one week in my life.&nbsp; One week. Seven days.&nbsp; You also might be thinking, &quot;Well, duh.&nbsp; Church! There's the answer to your solution!&quot;&nbsp; But it really isn't.&nbsp; The church we go to is, well.....at the moment, how do I say this nicely, boring.&nbsp; I really don't grow from going there.&nbsp; I mean, I &lt;3 the people of that church to DEATH.&nbsp; But I can't just go to another church, lest I start some MAJOR family drama (My grandmother would get SOO mad at me, since we're related to some of the original founders of the church and heaven forbid I go somewhere else..it would be like committing treason.&nbsp; And I really don't want to start drama.)&nbsp; It's summer, so that means no SCF.&nbsp; Julie still has the Bible Study going on, but I can't always get to that.&nbsp; At the moment, I just feel kinda lonely, spiritually.&nbsp; I mean, I know that I have everyone at church I could talk to about spiritual stuff, but it would be a big deal to schedule it (since they all live at least half an hour away) and blah blah blah.&nbsp; I know I have my accountability partner, but there is only so much you can say over e-mail.&nbsp; Sometimes you just want to go TALK to that person, maybe grab some lunch or whatever, but with us, we really can't.&nbsp; I just feel like there isn't a lot of people that are around me (in the same town) that can strengthen me (iron sharpening iron.)&nbsp; I can think of a couple.&nbsp; And also, even for the few people that I can think of, I can't just go up to them and say, &quot;____, I'm having a spiritual....crisis of sorts,&quot; and ask for their advice.&nbsp; It is a bajillion times easier for me to sort out my issues through writing.&nbsp; I'm more of a listener than a talker.&nbsp; (However, don't think that I don't adore my friends online and take them seriously--I do.&nbsp; But like I said, online communication has its limitations.)&nbsp; I really wish there was a way for me to truly tell if I am indeed serving God or just being insanely self-centered.&nbsp; I know the obvious answer-prayer.&nbsp; As much as I don't want to admit this, prayer is not one of my strong suits.&nbsp; I KNOW I don't do it nearly enough.&nbsp; Since I don't do it a lot, how in the world then am I supposed to know God's voice?&nbsp; That issue definitely came up senior year, when I was picking a college.&nbsp; I tried praying about it, but since I didn't really know God's voice, I didn't really know if I was making the right decision or not.&nbsp; I based my final decision on the cost of the school, not if it was part of God's plan or anything.&nbsp; I have a quote on my bedroom door that reads: &quot;<em>Preach the Gospel to all the world and if necessary, use words. ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>That, in my mind, is soo much easier said than done, especially when I'm not sure if the things I do in my life count as &quot;serving God.&quot;</p><p>I have also been truly thinking about the differences between proclaiming that you are a Christian and actually following Christ's example.&nbsp; Jesus never conformed to this world.&nbsp; He was radically different.&nbsp; How can I be radically different from this world if I am self-centered and of this world?&nbsp; Jesus is of God.&nbsp; I am of this (fallen, human) world.&nbsp; Those two are quite different.&nbsp; I can't not be of this world--it is who I am, literally.&nbsp; I really don't see how I can be a true imitator of Christ in that aspect.&nbsp; I can't just ignore the world (college, job, etc.) to focus on God--I need to be able to find a balance.</p><p>One thing I've noticed is that even when I am serving, there is always a teensy teensy tiny part of me that is doing it for the wrong reasons--for self-satisfaction and building myself up.&nbsp; I hate that part about myself, and have no clue how to change that.&nbsp; If not during, it is after the fact, kinda like &quot;Ohh, look what I did!&quot;&nbsp; I know that that is pride, and that is bad.&nbsp; I was wondering--if someone managed to completely &quot;die to self,&quot; would that aspect of self-satisfaction just...go away, or would it require a deliberate effort to get rid of?</p><p>Another thing is that even though I KNOW I've gotten closer to God, most of the time, I don't feel like I am any closer to Him.&nbsp; I know I shouldn't base my closeness to God on my (fickle) emotions, but I can't help it.&nbsp; I want to be able to <em>feel</em> the closeness, but am not able or not good at it, I'm not sure which one.&nbsp; Maybe it comes back to the fact that I don't spend nearly enough time in prayer?&nbsp; In order to be closer to God, regardless of how I feel, I need to change my motivation for everything I do, even the simplest decision.&nbsp; This is why the concept of dying to self is so insanely complicated because it involves complete, one hundred percent surrender.&nbsp; More often than not, we think we've surrendered a lot of our lives when we've really just begun the process.&nbsp; Either that, or we deliberately hold back parts of ourselves.&nbsp; But it seriously bothers me that at times I don't feel like I've grown much (spiritually) at all since I first beleived, even though I know I've grown.&nbsp; I know I've changed and grown even just in this year, but there are a lot of times where I just don't feel like I've grown any.&nbsp; Perhaps that is Satan's way of deceiving me.&nbsp; If that is true, then I've been believing lies for far too long.&nbsp; Is growth easier for someone else, on the outside looking in, to see?&nbsp; If so, have YOU seen spiritual growth in me?</p><p>When I was reading today, I found that passage in 1 Tim. 4.&nbsp; I wrote it down, and then without even realizing what I was doing, I basically wrote a mini-devotional about it.&nbsp; As I was writing it, an idea came into my head.&nbsp; I'm seriously considering starting to write little devotions to mail out to my friends (like Sarah used to do for people on ccmbuzz.)&nbsp; I was actually trying to post about that, but the buzz is down.&nbsp; Like I said, it was just an idea--an idea that needs a bit more ironing out (and probably prayer.)&nbsp; So be in prayer for that. =)&nbsp; Also, let me know if you would want to be involved in anything like that.&nbsp; I'm open to ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks.&nbsp; I just really think that I wrote it as a devotion for a reason, cos I generally don't just write up a devotion for other people in my journal.</p><p>And the bit from Lamentations just struck me and made me go, &quot;WOW.&quot; =D</p><p>I've been playing the dP album the entire time I was writing this blog and during EVERY song, I could see something reflected in both the song and my writing/thoughts.&nbsp; That album is sooo about dying to self.&nbsp; Exactly what I needed to hear.&nbsp; It seriously is such an amazing album.

"event","So yesterday in my devotions, I read Ecclesiastes 11:7-12:8, and it really struck me, and I've been thinking about it intensely ever since.<br /><br />I'm living for myself, not for God.&nbsp; Long story short, :<br /><br />These are the best years of my life, and I should be using them to honor and serve God, instead of serving myself.&nbsp; I know once I'm a lot older, when I look back on my life, I'll wish I was young again.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I don't use this time to serve God, I'm definitely going to regret it.<br /><br />My life revolves around <strong>solely</strong>&nbsp; myself, even though I say it revolves around God.&nbsp; I judge my life by the world's standards, not God's.&nbsp; I am supposed to be &quot;in the world and not of it,&quot; as a Christian, but more and more I think I am of this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />More often than not, I read my Bible out of obligation, not because I want to learn more about God.<br /><br />I know that I need to change, but have absolutely no clue how to go about doing that.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Matthew 16:24-27&nbsp;(New International Version)</h3><div class=""result-text-style-normal""><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Then Jesus said to his disciples, &quot;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We're called to set aside our selves and immerse ourselves <em>completely</em> for God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So how can I call myself a Christian if I'm living for myself?<br /><br />This theme of dying to self has come up a TON of times in my devotions in just the past year.&nbsp; I realize that the sheer fact that it is coming up a lot means that it is really important and God is trying to hammer it into my&nbsp;head, and I'm just basically not listening.<br /><br /><br /><strong>SHOW ME WHAT IT MEANS</strong>, by Jeremy Camp<br />I&rsquo;ve been here a thousand times before <br />Face down on the floor <br />Wondering how I even reached this place again <br /><br />But, You have shown so endlessly, how Your love pours over me <br />No picture can re-create the beauty that I see <br /><br /><br />Chorus: <br />Show me what it means, to live my life a sacrifice <br />If only I would realize how much it took to pay the price <br />I know I&rsquo;d always give, everything to You <br /><br />I want this world to see <br />Your perfect majesty <br />Reflecting from my life this brilliant poetry <br />[these lyrics are found on http://www.songlyrics.com]<br /><br />Written all over this place <br />The signs of all creation that You breathed <br />Words can&rsquo;t even state how much You mean to me <br /><br />Chorus: <br /><br />I want to face my very crime <br />Of not giving all of mine <br />But I can feel the hope You bring to me <br /><br />(2x&rsquo;s) <br />Chorus:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p></div>"

i almost SCORED against ABSEGAMI. I can't believe it.  if i had scored...wow. OMG.  that's CRAZY.  i really wished i did score.  either way, the entire team was screaming in excitement at my shot.  that's why i LOVE and cherish my teammates--they really care about everyone and encourage everyone, no matter what.  I can't believe its almost over.  i may not always like the coaches, but i LOVE my teammates.  especially when they leave awesome comments on my picture on my myspace :)  :) :) :)

im glad mom and i went driving today to look for coach's house cos otherwise, i would NOT have found it.  at all.

oh and yesterday, before the game, i was chillin.  i was with meg for a bit, then i saw jenni and heather over by coach rock so i went over there for a bit.  a little bit into the convo, heather/rock/jenni (i forget who actually *asked*) asked me to get out of the convo for a few minutes cos they had something to say about me..but they all assured me it was good.. so that's always a mood booster, especially when Rock was involved.  so i went over and talked to coach brown.  cos she's cool and everything. :)

STATES GAMES ARE COMING UP SOON! YAY! :)

but.  not everything in the world is peachy.

from what i heard today, Reston, Nestor's sister, was hit by a car today. (i know her from track...and from Nestor) i don't know the details or anything, though.  but nestor was still in school after he knew about it.  i couldn't do that. i would be out as soon as i heard the news.  but he probably had a good reason.  or, at least, i'm HOPING he did.

at lunch there was a fight. well not a *huge* fight, just two guys. i didn't see it happen, cos it was behind me, i just saw the security guard running in, saying ""WOAH!!!"" and the entire cafeteria getting silent.  i turned around and saw Rich (the security guy) taking away this one guy. another security guard came up and took the other guy (the one who got hit) away.  his face was covered in blood.  it was SO gross.  i heard later that the kid couldn't even see when he was in the nurse's office; i also heard the fight was over a crushed sub.  milk was thrown also.  the guy who got hit didn't get out of the other guy's seat, so after the crushing of the sub and the throwing of the milk, he got hit in the face.  really hard.  the kid who hit him must have had a ring on him or something cos his face was *so* covered in blood.  ew. it was gross."

"event","""lets see..quick soccer update.  we beat LCM (lower cape may) 6-1 after being down 1-0 at half.  i played in both halves.  and in the first half i was  a threat so the other team kicked it out, giving us a corner kick.  because if they didnt i would have scored.



holy spirit game at lakeside.  field was muddy but not really slippery.  and it was raining during the game.  we won 2-0.  i played a bit in the end of the game, thus keeping up my streak of playing in every varsity only game. but that trend will probably end when we play state games.  yeah.



game yesterday versus pennsville.  due to the insane amount of rain lately, their field was practically ALL mud and reeally slippery.  i played in both halves. we won 2-0. at the end, i was playing left mid and if the girl that i was marking got the ball and i wasnt there, i would run and catch her every single time.  imagine if it wasn't all muddy how fas i would have been against her then.

"event","Four day weekends are so. freaking. wonderful.  I've gotten SO much done today it's not even funny.  And the best part is, if I don't finish everything, I can work on stuff tomorrow and Monday (well between practice and the team dinner at Robin's...) 

it's rained ALL day long.  i love the rain.  especially days like today, when we *desperately* need the rain and the rain is a steady rain all day.  

mom and dad went to Lancaster to see Ruth being perfomed at Sight and Sound with people from church today, so since after lunch, i've been all alone.  and that is wonderful.  mom did call once a little while ago to make sure i'm okay. the funny thing is, i could have been *out* somewhere (cos they only needed one vehicle for the two of them, thus leaving me a vehicle and i have keys to that vehicle...and they said i could go out somewhere...its just that..i dont have a lot of money and there is no where really to go.  but i could have been out when she called, thus really making her worry.  but that didn't happen...)

i haven't had this much free time...since over the summer.  like the beginning of summer, so it is a very welcomed thing.  since i dont understand my english questions, after this, i shall go read my Bible.  for the first time in awhile, just because i've been *so* busy I haven't had a chance to read it alot.  

i LOVE playing around with photoshop in yearbook when i have nothing else to do.  its so fun."

"event","we tied absegami today 0-0 and i didn't play, but i had an idea that i wasnt gonna play going into the game.  well. we could have beaten them but we just didnt place the ball in the right spots.  we are a good team and as good as them, if not better.  

no practice yesterday, and none tomorrow.  when we played EHT we won 7-0, i played, AND i almost scored at least twice!! WOOHOO!!! did i mention about hammonton? cos i played then too and we won 4-0 and i think i did pretty well then too.  that game was really windy though.  

oh! i IMPRESSED kopreski (the AP english teacher) with  my writing. YAAAAY.

mac and i got rushed thru our anatomy test today so we could go to our game and that wasn't fair because we both know we didnt' do good.  and sester is the kind of teacher that since we saw the questions if we told her about it, she would either count it against us or change the essay questions (and probably make them harder). 

i love team singalongs on the bus <3

i need to do a LOT of things soon...i hope i remember"

"event","Had my driver's test today.  I PASSED!!! YAY! I got a *really*  nice lady who was laughing with me and actually helped me parallel park the second time around (my first time was crappy..I blame it on nerves..)  :D :D  So after that, we go home, get my school stuff, and head over to vineland to get my actual license.  my picture came out SO well it wasn't even funny.  and my signature is actually...LEGIBLE!!!

so i get to school and by the time i go to the attendance office and almost to my locker, the bell for the end of third period rings.  which makes my life a LOT easier, since my locker is right near the guidance office and that's my 4th period class.  the only downside of coming in late was that i couldnt get to my gym locker.  thankfully, i didnt need my english book today.  it was in there and i had no way to get it out.  

don't have a lot of homework

we won our game 4-0...and I PLAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IN BOTH HALVES!!!! OFFENSE AND DEFENSE!!! AND I ALMOST SCORED, TWICE-IF IT WASN'T FOR THE GOALIE TRIPPING ME/RUNNING INTO ME I WOULD HAVE SCORED!  THEIR DEFENSE WASN'T GOOD AT ALL WHICH MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS A GOOD PLAYER.  I HAD SOME GOOD PASSES AND A FEW GOOD RUNS.  I WAS OKAY ON DEFENSE, BUT NOT GREAT.  BUT I PLAYED!  YAY! FIRST GAME I PLAYED IN SINCE VINELAND!

Last night's BYF was..powerful.  i think that if we get thru a bunch of crap that is preventing us from truly being a group, we will be an awesome group.  i would rather not go into all those details, but trust me.  and a lot of us think that for the discussions we will be having that the 7th and 8th graders will not be able to take them seriously but we can't tell them not to come because there is no one else willing to lead them.  this is how powerful it was--i cried three separate times, i think.  and i dont normally cry in public."

"event","the band i heard at the carnival was a local band.  called Aim For Christ (AIM FC). check them out at www.aimfc.moonfruit.com  singing their own songs they are great, but singing other songs they are just okay.  but i am also a very harsh critic, especially when it comes to songs that i like.

crazy busy with soccer.  we beat vineland 6-0.  FREAKIN' AWESOME.  almost scored.  got complimented by vineland coach and then teammates at half.  to quote coach, i ""could have been a hero"" if i had scored.  last time we beat vineland we were in 7th grade.  HECK FREAKIN YES.  

also busy with schoolwork.  this will be a fun year.  AP english is a lot of independant work, which is a big change, but other than that, this year is basically in the bag.  

and attempting to have a social life.

i really need to read my Bible more.  Jose brought his to school and read it when he wasnt doing anything.  i would do that, but my backpack gets kinda heavy and my back would hurt after awhile, i think.  but if i found a softback instead of a hardback copy then maybe that would be better


CREATION PICS ARE UP!! www.creationfest.com/east

<P>We also have a white jersey, but I don't think its as awesome as that one.&nbsp; And it FITS!! The first one all 4 years that FITS!!! I'm so happy.&nbsp; Like Mac, I LOVE getting uniforms because we get so much cool stuff!&nbsp; </P>
<P>And I was right-so far, I haven't gotten a lot of playing time.&nbsp; But I knew that would happen coming in.&nbsp; Its fun, nonetheless.&nbsp; </P>

<P>YAY SOCCER SEASON!!</P>"

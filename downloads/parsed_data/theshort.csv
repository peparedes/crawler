Its funny how your life can change by every choice you make but in the long run the problems are still the same no matter what."

"event","my life changed, i was put here to do something great with my life and i started to screw things up by doing very stupid things and, i finally understand what was so great that i would be doing with my life. being a fire fighter is my calling. for a while i felt like my life was crashing down on me. i made some mistakes but i got through them, and i am glad i did. i am finally ready to put the past behind me and move on. the pain i felt is now gone. i still miss a big part of my past, but that part of me will always stay in my heart forever."

"event","<font color=""#000000"">Its almost 3 in the mourning and I cant sleep. To much on my mind i guess. Feeling trapped within myself and I can't escape who I've become or who I am turning  into. I don't know what i am going to become. All i know is that what ever it is its going to destroy me. People tell me we can sometimes see whats ahead I saw whats in store for me. I have been given a deed that I must do and that's all I can so towards that. Anyways its like what ever dude. Well its 3 in the mourning now so I think i am going to sleep.<br /><br />Until My Next Entry This Is:<br /><br />The Short<br /></font>"

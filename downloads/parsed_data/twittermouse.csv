Small, simple, safe price
Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets
This is not a small cut that scabs, and dries, and flakes, and heals
And I am not afraid to die
I'm not afraid to bleed, and fuck, and fight.
I want the pain of payment
What's left, but a section of pigmy size cuts
Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks
Would you be my little cut?
Would you be my thousand fucks?
And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid
To fill, and spill over, and under my thoughts
My sad, sorry, selfish cry out to the cutter
I'm cutting trying to picture your black broken heart
Love is not like anything
Especially a fucking knife

Look at me, you can tell
By the way I move and do my hair
Do you think that it's me or it's not me?
I don't even care
I'm alive
I don't smell
I'm the cleanest I have ever been.
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry 

Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake

Do I drink? Do I date?
I've got perfect placement all my ink
Satisfied, in your eyes
I'm the biggest fan I've got right now
I made sure, that I look how I wanted to look
The people around me, the people surround me
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry 

Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake

My stomach hurts now, and all tied off in lace
I pray, I beg for anything, to hit me in the face
and this sicknes isn't me, I pray to fall from grace
The last thing I see is feeling
And I'm telling you I'm a fake
And I'm telling you I'm a fake
And I'm telling you I'm a fake
And I'm telling you I'm a fake
And I'm telling you I'm...	
	
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake I'm a fake"

"event","Whee! This is working again... my comp wouldn't load it for the longest time. 
    I was prety much just thinking about school, since Kel is watching Mean Girls, and that's about high school and stereotypes and things like that.
    In my school I get away with anything and everything. They all think I'm fucking insane. I've cut every class (except orchestra and theory) at least three times this marking period. I haven't gotten a single dentention or cut slip, or even a reprimand.
    Now, I'm not complaining about not being punished, cause being punished would suck. It's just strange the shit I can get away with because I'm considered ""crazy"" by most of my teachers. One of my friends, who is normalish, cut a class and got in trouble for it. I can blatently cut class and no one says anything. It's like they just think ""Well, she is a bit crazy, we should just leave her be"". 
   I know sometimes I have trouble in other situations, because I get used to not having rules, to everyone having such low expectations of me, that they don't even expect me to follow the most basic of rules, like go to class. 
   This marking period I got B's. I didn't do a scrap of hw, I skipped class almost every other class in some. And yet I got B's, so i can't help but think that none of them must really be grading me either."

And then she tells me that she wants to go to a counselor at school because she's having a lot of problems at home and with her sis and she wants someone to talk to, and stuff, and she has been thinking about cutting herself. 
I feel so bad :( She got the idea from her sister and I, I know that, but it is also because of us that she hasn't done it yet. She said she doesn't want to go down the same path we did. But she wouldn't even be thinking it if we didn't set a bad example. (I'm not sure that her sister considers herself a bad example or role model or whatever, but I know that I definetly consider myself a bad example)
I just feel so bad for her, it hurts me to see her so sad, when she was talking about all the shit that happens in her house and how her parents pretty much forget about her, since they're worried about her sister's problems, and she started crying and it just is so sad to see her so upset. I love her, and it kills me to see her crying and sad."

Generally, today has been pretty decent, better so far than yesterday. I'm in school right now, so my allergies aren't acting up, but they will when I get home, but I think I'm just going to lay down, try to relax and watch a movie.

Then I talked to my old english teacher cause I ran into her in the hall, and she completely takes my dad's side on everything, so then I got really annoyed with that. 
Then I come home and I can't find the picture I needed for creative writing. And then my allergies completely kicked in. My nose is so stuffy, I have a bad headache, my throat hurts and everything. And my mom comes home and starts bugging me, and I tried to just tell her I'm in a bad mood, but she kept tlaking to me, which was like okay, but irratating cause I'm in a pissed off type mood. 
Now my allergies are worse, I'm horribly irratible, my sister is home, acting like she fucking five, making so much damn noise. She acts like she's my fucking mother when mom isn't around, just to get on my nerves, and then other times doesn't give a fuck whether or not I'm alive. 
I just want to take some benadryll (that's allergy medicine, not sure if its US only) and lay down, but I can't do that because I'm not allowed benadryll (cause of my OD), and I can't lay down and justt try to sleep because my stupid sister has the TV on, and it's on the other side of my wall  
And there is people and kids outside that won't shut the fuck up. I hate people, I hate noise.

I'm utterly depressed and very angry, and I don't know why. I desperatly needed to talk, but I couldn't today, since so much happened at partial. One girl's mom threw a fuss and stuff, and then Nita made a big stink about nothing and threatened to runaway. All day Nite was yapping, saying the same thing over and over. If random outbursts of ""WOULD YOU SHUT UP ALREADY?!"" were allowed, I would of done it a few times. 
So, I going to my room a little early tonight, to try and work out what ""everything"" is. I probably won't get anywhere with it though. 
I also wanted to cut so badly today, I had a safety pin with me also (since I was trying to fix my bracelet). I was so hard to not cut. But, I didn't. 
Now I'm just sitting, and waiting for mom to come home, and she'll be home in like ten minutes. She will have pizza :)
Also, if my bus driver is going to do the route backwards (like he stupidly did today), I'm walking home tomorrow. So, I'm wearing my comfy sneakers and my backpack to partial tomorrow, just in case."

They went in to see the movie, and I gave up on working. I was too dizzy and Manny kept telling me not to lean on the thing I was standing by, so I didn't, and my head was swimming so bad, I walked over to Chris and asked if I could go home early. He said no, since the person for the night wasn't there yet, but James said if I wanted him to, he'd just cover, which was so nice of him. He was really sweet to me today, he covered door when I needed to get a little break, to go get a drink or whatever, or to just sit. He and George hung out by door for a while, wihch was pretty fun, since we stood around and talked.

And then the one boss who I thought was a complete jerk who wanted me like die or something came up in his car and asked what was wrong. So, as usual I said nothing. So he asked why I was sitting outside like that (I was more or legs sitting in a corner hugging my knees, and I said I had just needed some fresh air.

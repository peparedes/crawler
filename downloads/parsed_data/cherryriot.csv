could somebody PLEASE remind me what thoose thingies are called errr let me elaborate... there was a website you could go to and i guess download a program or something so you could take a pic and super enlarge it so that when you print it out it comes out in multiple pieces of paper so that when you put them together you get a giant version of the pic.... . omg there is totally an easier way to explain but i'm lacking sleep and i have too do to even think about sleep right now... gym, interview, blah blah and on and on ...


ps: wtf is up with job applications, after asking for&nbsp; all your past supervisors contacts to use as refferences they ask you to give three references that arnt job related or family related... family related i can&nbsp; understand but not job related...then um who in the world do they want like your friend's numbers??? im totally confused by that ... ..

also what's up with places asking your favorite ice cream flavor in an interview, i swear i've had 3 places do that already and none of them were ice cream shops .....&nbsp;"

<p>Despite all the wonkyness (including my job search and bizaro encounter at TONI &amp; GUY Hair Salon well apparently LOL the stylist thought that I had just had my hair styled at a competeing salon....LOL then went on to say that if I let it grow out for 2 or3 weeks we could deffinetly work something fabulous. he said something about not wanting to ""represent another companies work in their show book""&nbsp; *eyeroll* so it's either wait it out or go some where else ...hmmmm....<br />he <br /><br />BUT YEAH DESPITE ALL THAT WONKYNESS.....I met a&nbsp; nice fellow at the party named Jay, Jay offered me some E for free after we'd been chatting a bit. I said </p>
<p>okie dokie since it&nbsp; is the one party&nbsp; favor I realy do enjoy quite a bit but really don't do very much of,r i don't&nbsp; I don't do half&nbsp; the partyfavors i use to. ANYWAY we ended up talking for hours all curled up and playing with each others fingers and touching each others skin..it wasnt about sex. it was just so cute and&nbsp; innocent. He mentioned going to a hotel but I'm glad we changed our minds he's to nice of a person to just use for sex , dont think me or him are ready for serious relationships right now... .but he's a nice guy even though we are very much different.&nbsp;<br /><br />thanks for that pill , jay.&nbsp; Everything now feels a bit like the movie Amelie and has kept me wrapped up in positive feelings today.&nbsp;<br /><br />Shite laundry is done gotta go get that and hit the gym, ha! did i tell you my mother has mentioned if she's me any thinner than i am now (137lbs) she's putting me in hospital for anorexia which is CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i just make sure I burn the calories I eat at the gym, plus i mean I walk TONS in the city, and I LOVE FOOD!! LOL !!!!!!!</p>"

THEN a,b,c,d,e,&nbsp;&nbsp; but um that makes no sense ..... errr ANYONE KNOW?

"event","<p>Bah I HATE THE NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT SYSTEM AND THE RAIN!!! ALL YOU NYC HO'S KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!!!<br /><br />Around&nbsp;3:30 or 4 yesterday the subway stops like in queens err&nbsp;20 or 30 somthin street and they keep saying 5 more mintues due to flooding ...after an hour me and everyone else are like fuck this and get off to see if we can catch a bus...problem is most of everyone on the subway doesnt know which bus to take to&nbsp;get where they're going&nbsp;just like me. so I decided aww fuck it I'd try walking home haha after 1 hour of that I was lost then hoped on a random bus which took me to main street in flushing which sounded familiar so then&nbsp;I get there but realize that main st is acturally miles long not just a few blocks like the part i pass daily so i'm in this part that totally is like canal street and it's raining like woah ..... I WAS BEYOND PISSED MY HAIR MODEL&nbsp; THING AT TONI&nbsp;&amp; GUY SALON WAS AT 6....it was already way past that so i go somewhere i never go ....burger king and order some onion rings and pout for ten minutes then I finaly find a subway station but the only train working is the 7 so I thought great ok i'd take that mess to time square then hop on one of a million trains to forrest hills/continental ave.... well NO TRAINS AT ALL ARE GOING TO QUEENS! they had like busses set up and no one controlling shit and bus drivers not knowing where they were going it was mayhem yo! getting on the people knocked an old lady down and almost stomped each other and on the bus some gehto ho was like ""i'll bust yo teeth out yo mouth if you dont open dis window""&nbsp; and just threatening the bus driver the whole time...it was cwazy.... I FINALY GET HOME AT FUCKING 11:30PM what usually takes maybe 30 minutes took me from 4pm to fucking 11<br /><br /><br />bahhhhhhh and on top of that they over booked my sewing class at F.I.T. and since i was one of the later people to sign up they put me in a class at a later date like june 25th! i was suppost to start on sunday grrrrr ...i might sign up for a fashion sketch class there&nbsp; that wasnt too expensive since i'm not likeing the art students league that much and the only reason i'm taking these classes is to get my skills in better shape for when i apply to F.I.T. this fall but I really cant afford all these classes right now but my godparents who i'm staying with keep encouraging it so i'm doing something ""productive"" with my time and i mean they arnt asking for any money for me staying with them and trust me i've offered a bunch of times.&nbsp; so i feel sorta obligated... bah i need to find a job i think im going to just tell them i signed up for a week of classes for this week and then just job search because i never have the time AND I HAVENT BEEN OUT TO A PARTY ALL WEEK!!! because by the time i get back i dont have enough time to do everything i like to do before going out (if i dont go to the gym in the am i like going in the evening before going out or i feel i dont know flabby. ) aah well i scored a hawt top at cheap jacks and have some hawt ideas i'm bringing to life right now ...expect photos verry soon . .. !</p>"

"event","OUCHIES!!! Don't ever throw your bleach strips on your teeth right after brushing...especially if you might of been a bit too over enthusiastic with the tooth brush and cut your gum a wee bit. OUCH!!! This is the extra strength bleaching system by Rembrandt too so it's extra ouchie! 

I've decided I love the idea of bright bright unnaturally white teeth, but crooked you know well like the lovely teeth I inherited from my Dad's side (Mostly English and some  Irish) I mean they were perfectly straight at one point and I had my ""Madonna Space"" closed up ... when I got braces back when I was 15. Though I got those awful vanity braces that go on the back of the teeth, and even though they might not show, the stupid wires always came out a bit and would cut the fuck out of my mouth. It got to the point where it got so annoying and I was soooooooo sick of having to go back to the Orthodontist to get the wires fixed and just painful in general that I actually took a pair of pliers and pulled the wires out! FO REAL! Though they were almost done by that point and they probably would have stayed perfectly straight if I would have put my retainer in overnight... but bah! Of course I never kept up. But now for some reason I'm loving my crazy teeth and I'm usually not a fan of the crazy un-natural game show host white toothed look... but lately I'm loving it but only if the teeth aren't perfect. For instance Kate Moss....I love her teeth and their as fugged up as ever, some of her's look like fangs almost."

Ebay is kinda out because they apparently have strict rules now about only being able to sell up to face value (I think you need to post a pic of the ticket)

BUT I HAVE 5TH ROW MADONNA TICKETS AT MADISON SQ GARDEN IN NYC AND ON THE NIGHT THEY ARE FILMING THE DVD/CABLE SPECIAL!

SO what do you Ho's think? I mean I see ticket not close to as good as mine going for way more on ebay but I don't wana risk loosing my acount and all my feedback you know? 

I found this one site www.buyselltix.com anyone familiar with it, think I'd have good luck there?"

"event","Happy Mother's Day to the few Mommy Ho's who read this =)
Unfortunetly this Mother's Day is turning out to be like all the other's for me, me trying needing to force my mom to go out for Mother's Day and her not wanting to go anywhere ""nice"". *eyeroll* 

It was a disaster and ended up being super expensive getting down here too, due to the chinatown bus fucking up ... . I forget if I posted about that....

I showed up early for the chinatown bus to DC and the stupid guy tells me it's been cancled and there's nomore that day and to come back tomarow and then I'm like uh WTF give me my money back then, and he was all like ""no english!"" ......so then I lugg my stuff over to port authority but it was already like 5 or 6 and the next bus wasn't leaving till 8 or 9 (alot were sold out cause of mothers day) and wouldn't get me to dc till after the metro was closed so I'd be stranded.

SO THEN....I lugg my self over to Penn station and check out the train.... everything is sold out except business class seats on the Aceala (It's a slightly faster train than the normal ones and cuts the time by an hour or a half hour..I forget which.)Cept tickets were like $135/$150  so I had to shell that mess out and then wait till 9PM! What really sucks is there I was waiting in the yucky general seats when I acturally had access to the Aceala Club waiting room where I guess they have internet and free snacks and drinks and stuff... and I didn't see it till I was in line to get on the focking train!!!!! GRRRRRRRR so that plus the lost $20 on the chinatown bus, plus the cab ride from the metro station ($20) because it was so insainely late and my friend ended up not being able to get me cause her car was being wonky (i think her bf just wouldn't lend her the car cause he doesn't like me , i wasn't the nicest to him in high school since he had more that a whee bit of a crush on my gf and now im close friends with his gf) SO LIKE ALMOST $200 TO GET HOME FOR MOTHER'S DAY!!! IT WAS SUPPOST TO BE $20!!!!!! 

I'm throwing up ebay auctions for hair dye shit like crazy to get some extra cash and trying to figure out what the best way of selling this extra madonna ticket is since ebay only lets you sell up to face value and mine is worth SOOOOOOOOOOO much more."

I seriously thought I had maybe 1 or 2 drinks at Happy Valley last week, now last night I was I dressed in a FABULOUS OUTFIT...really trully I couldn't wait to work that mess! Then what happends I CAN'T FIND MY FUCKING BOOTS THAT I NEED FOR THE OUTFIT! I had worn them out lastweek to happy valley ...so after talking to a freind on the phone and searching for like 45 minutes I came to the conclution I had left them at some sort of after party I don't even remember going to and going home in my chucks!! 

Thats rather scarry no??!?!

And the thing is I really like being supah smashed anymore ... I suppose I am old now. But yuck. I vaguely remember amanda lepore or someone next to her giving me drink tickets so maybe thats how all this mayhem happend...grrrrrrr.

So I didn't go to the party last night =( instead I dragged my friend around da city till all hours of the morning looking for an open hookah bar...we finaly gave up and found ourselves exploring some halfway constructed building and curling up with cheap champagne (WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN END UP DRINKING!) and watching the sunrise ... all super cheesey like then piged out greasy diner style amd then worked every single one of thoose delicious calories off at zee gym...

BAH I WANA SLEEP! 

Well I'm off to throw my resume around da city and stop at DSW or some mess and try finding cheap ""dress shoes"" jah know something I'd wear if I wear waiting tables and a more pricey place ....I have a few back in Maryland but bah none here."

Still not dead, just killing you with my atrocious style....here's some more photos from Tuesday... Manson & Dita decided to show up so Dita could ride a giant carousel pony on stage. I was told me and zee MM were laughing bout my rubber pork chop shirt but frankly I don't remember a bit. I really wish I did! I've always wanted to see Dita dance! HMPH! Wasn't she just there two weeks ago??

"event","I'm not saying I'm grateful for this opurtunity to be up in the NYC for such an extended period but ahhhhhh everything seems to be going wrong on this trip yo! 

I'm in back home in Maryland right now for like half a second, I'm going back later up to NYC later this afternoon. Why? Well 2 days ago I lost my wallet! UGH! This is so stupid, I know I had it when I got on a bus in Queens that night because I keep my subway/bus pass ticket in my wallet but this is when I don't know what happend. All I can figure is I put my wallet on my lap and then it fell on the floor when I got up to get off the bus but I would never do such a stupid thing and I know I wasn't pick pocketed, there were only two other's on the bus. I hoped maybe the bus driver would come across the wallet since I realized like 10  min but nothing came of that. I didn't have cash or anything in there but well I'm really pissed because I had just got a new ID and it was a good photo, now I got a replacement today and I came out looking like a fish in the photo!!! And now I need to wait like 7 days for a new debt card so I guess I need to bring a bunch of cash back up to NYC with me, and that just freaks me out walking around with a lot of cash. 

Hmmm I was at the new Patricia Fields store in the Bowery a couple days ago and she was actualy in the store which I thought was weird. I got to chatting with her and a worker there and asked if they were hiring and was told well I was told ""WORK DAT SHIT!"" and then to bring in a resume. So I guess I'll see what comes of that, but like I think I'd be better off waiting tables but it'd be more fun working at Pat Fields fo sho! (I totally got the tackyiest most fabulous thing ever there, a sequin encrusted fanny pack bwhahaha!). 

Comming home felt awful I deffinetly wana get back to NYC, basicaly my Mother just kept trying to fight with me and call me a freak (wtf!?) etc ....and when I got home I found she'd been through my entire room ..her excuse was she was ""cleaning"" but she had gone through old private letters from people that I had saved etc... . gawd I was so Pissed. 

BLEH MORE LATER! Tonight I deffinetly want to get muh drink on, this whole little mini trip home has just made it even more clear that I don't belong here at all, the only good part of comming home was seeing my dog molly. HA! MY Mother even told me I was dirty and smelled LOL! It was beyond crazy especially since I'm a hygene freak. I think it's just because I was ignoreing all her other attempts at trying to fight with me bahhhh. 

Righto time to go throw a movie on and try getting a tiny bit of sleep."

"event","I am 100% wasting time till the rain lets up a bit again so I can head to zee gym. So I was looking around on www.lastnightsparty.com to see if there were any from Happy Valley last Tuesday since alot of people took my photo but I always forget to ask who they are or where the photo is going....I figured one of the people were with last nights party, and I kinda wanted an updated photo ha! I wanted to show you ho's how I acidently fucked up my hair by playing around with the Redken Shades EQ hair glosses by forgetting to dillute the tint...its been awfull my hair is this awfull sorta dark blonde/honey blonde shade after trying a few things, anything to avoid having to use bleach. it's like that awfull shade that like every girl has this season ...you know what im talking about. YUCK! So I'm thinking 10vol isn't that bad on the hair and I dont need much lift so I'm gonna try picking some up today at ricky's in Manhatten...then just condition the fuck outta my hair. Maybe I should try getting some weave lol just to make it a tad longer and then have it super choppy ....like platnium and white maybe? but I'd have to find someone with a good hook up cause dis ho can't be spendin hundreds of dollas! <br /><br />ANYWAY hahaha here's the ONLY Photo I found with me in it and I'm in the background and most of my head is cut off and the photo is mainly of some creepy lookin ho! BUT IT'S CURRENT! Okay let's play WHERE'S DA TRISTEN MONSTAH?!??!&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.lastnightsparty.com/happyangel/slides/IMG_0960.JPG"" />"

Dis bitch wants to bleach splatter a pair of super tight blue denim jeans I got at H&M. I don't like the shade they aren't that super dark blue color or black (the only way I can tolerate denim, just normal blue but the fit looks hawt.. . .I think they'll look perfect once I bleach splatter 'em and then add a few random hot pink spray paint strokes here and there .... 

Thing is every time dis Ho tries to bleach splatter like anything it always comes out like well either yellowy-orangey and not white or I end up disintegrating the fabric!... should I be using something other than Clorox?"

"event","Hmm so mostly what I'll be doing in this internship is brainstorming ideas for the juniors spring '07 line. Which even though I'll have to tone down my taste a bit is alright but thing is it's all sketching on zee computer using micrografx designer (never heard of it before, from what I gather pretty much like illustrator). Thing is I have no idea how to do this mess! I told Celeste's assistant yesterday on the phone and she said it was fine and that they don't expect me to know everything when I get there and that they would set up a computer for me to play around and try to familiarize myself with the software. So I guess it all sounds good but I'm terrified I'm going to get up there and not understand the software at all and just be of no use what so ever. 

My godfather who lives in queens (flushing) turned his basement into an apt for his wife's son when he was going to college (he's married now and moved out) and he said I could stay there if I want ... .. it's just that, that would be a bus ride and train ride to get into the city so I'm still searching craigslist. 

I need to give Celeste a call today or tomorrow to let her know my decision and discuss money/pay and finalize hours...her assistant said it'd be most likely a month, 3 days a week, like 10-5 hour wise. 

GAWD ALL THIS MESS IS STRESSING ME OUT LIKE WOAH AND GIVING ME A HEADACHE! My mother's thing of screaming instead of talking (all you ho's with Italian mommies know what I mean!) is so not helping! 

PS: wana apologize to all you Ho's who have called me lately and I have been awful at returning calls, I've just been so insanely stressed over this mess."

"event","Well I heard back from Celeste (FINALY!) she answered my email i sent this morning about an hour after I sent it. She asked if we could talk on friday since she just got back from a trip and it's crazy at her job so I guess on Friday I'll find out if this internship thing is for real or not. I keep getting doubtfull but Im keeping my hopes up...I really have no reason to think it will or wont work out, just paranoid. 

I've been checking craigslist for like short term subleting and it doesn't look too bad at all. 

Ah I really really really hope this all works out."

"event","<sup><font size=""3""><font color=""#010101"">&nbsp;</font> About a week/a week and a half ago I got a <strong>VERY</strong> potentially exciting proposal/offer, I didn't post about it because I didn't want to jinx it but I'm just so nervous and paranoid about the whole thing that I thought I'd post...</font></sup>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">So well remember how I met up with&nbsp;that lady Celeste (who is a distant relative connected by marriage) in NYC back in January? She's&nbsp;head designer for a small company and took me to a&nbsp;fashion trends presentation and&nbsp;design expo. &nbsp;Well about a week and a half ago she emailed me asking me if I'd like to <strong>come intern for her in NYC!!!</strong> Since they&nbsp;are super busy and could use the help.&nbsp;<br /><br />um.....<strong>YES!!!!!!</strong></font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">This so couldn't have come at a better time since I recently got&nbsp; fired/quit my job at the hotel (long story which I'll post later...&nbsp; in brief, lack of hours and inexperienced supervisors who can't do their job suck). Though I would of quit my job and jumped on a bus to NYC in a second anyway I mean this is a&nbsp;perfect opportunity. The company doesn't really design clothing I'm interested in, Celeste even admits it's not her first choice but it's a good job, they mainly design for like preteen girls, from what I saw (not too much) I got the idea it's sort of geared toward the girly girl teeny bopper type, they say they design for the all American ""every girl"", whatever that might mean. it would look great on my resume though and also for when I apply to F.I.T. , also just the experience I'd get.<br /><br /></font></sup>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""The thing that's got me so nervous and paranoid is.. .. . "">
<div><sup><font size=""3"">The thing that's got me so nervous and paranoid is.. .. . Celeste usually responds to my emails right away via her blackberry. Well it's been a week and a half and I haven't gotten a response from her and I've tried calling her job too&nbsp;but just got the machine (it's her personal office line),&nbsp;I left her one message but haven't gotten a response yet and didn't want to seem overly pushy so I didn't leave anymore. I've been getting all kinds of ideas in my head thinking she made a mistake or even it was&nbsp;a cruel joke (ok that's silly I know!). Then my Mom did make a point that&nbsp;Celeste does go on business trips ALOT, &nbsp;overseas and such. Though that wouldn't really explain why I haven't heard back from her via email. So today I sent her another email and will try calling her at work, I think email is best though because in the email she sent making the offer she said they were super insanely busy lately, so she probably wouldn't have a lot of time to talk while at work. I just don't get why I haven't heard back from her because in the email she did make it sound like they needed me right away, like she wrote ""we need someone as soon as next week so get back to me as soon as you can"". I did get the email 3 days after she sent it because the email addy she has I only use for business stuff and family stuff so I don't check it daily usually if I'm not expecting anything. I hope she didn't think I wasn't interested or anything, I did explain why I got back to her 3 days after in my response which I'm sure she understood. But no response at all is totally not like her at all. </font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">I hope I hear back from her today or super soon because I've stopped applying for jobs for the moment because I didn't want to have to quit a new job. The other thing I wanted to ask her was that in the email she mentioned that we could discuss either pay by the hour or pay for your commute? which really didn't make any sense to me because she knows I only pay $35 roundtrip to get up there on the Chinatown bus, maybe did she mean pay for my hotel when I'm up there? I'm sure she didn't expect me to commute back and forth every day from DC&nbsp;so that really confuses me. I know most internships aren't paid at all but I'm just wondering. </font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">There's also the question of where I'll stay during the internship. I heard that hotel 17 where I stood in January had long term weekly rates which were cheaper, plus it makes sense I mean I'm sure Amanda Lepore doesn't pay the daily rate (she lives there) and I've heard others have lived there too. But when I emailed them the response hardly even answered my question they just gave me the daily rates and didn't even answer my question about weekly rates. So if any of you ho's in the NYC area know of places I could stay for like 2-3 weeks that are affordable and&nbsp;have weekly rates&nbsp;(I really don't know how long it is yet but at the shortest I'd say at least 2 weeks) PLEASE let me know. </font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">My grandmother (the one I get along with) lives in NY but in a really bad part of Brooklyn (not the fun Williamsburg area) she refuses to move since she's lived there for like over 50 years despite my aunt wanting to set her up with a condo near my mom or in Florida or being asked to come live with various family members, she just loves where she is. Anyway she really wants me to move in with her but it just wouldn't work because of her location like&nbsp;I don't know how it is now but last time I was there when I was like 15 it was still really sketchy (and I usually don't have a problem with bad areas but this just wouldn't be good) plus there'd be a huge problem with night time activities and getting back by cab since I doubt most cabs would go from Manhattan to that area at nighttime.&nbsp;If it were a better area I would love to, it would be great living with her, we're super close and she loves my style (heh she even collects photos of me clubbing), also she use to be a seamstress so she could teach me alot. </font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">Well that was way long but gawd I hope she gets back to me soon, I've been even having dreams where I think I get an email back from her but then wake up and realize it was a dream. I'm surprised she offered me this since she knows I really don't have much experience and haven't been to school for it yet, not that most things interns do really require either of thoose things really but almost all places require you have them. </font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></sup></div>
<div><sup><font size=""3"">I'm such a nervous wreck....&nbsp;.... .</font></sup></div>

"event","<div>Tonight this woman from the Epilepsy foundation is coming to my house at like 6:30 to meet with my mom and I to discuss possible financial aide for school and other things I might qualify for (due to my seizure disorder). I definitely will be eating my Ativan (anti-anxiety pill) like candy tonight, I hate interviews/meetings. This whole thing seems a bit odd to me, I mean usually you would go to an office or something for the meeting/interview whatever, but apparently they usually come to the people's houses because most people they are dealing with don't drive (due to epilepsy). So yeah I don't know what to expect really, but I've just been cleaning all day like crazy. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Thought I'd cut the all the blibble blabble.. .. .. "">I feel kind of like I shouldn't even be meeting with this woman because I mean yeah technically I have a seizure disorder but I'm fine if I take my Depekote. I mean I don't feel like I&nbsp;am ""disabled""&nbsp;I do all the things your not supposed to do if you have seizure disorders: I drink alcohol, I'm a caffeine freak, I do a lot of cardio work out at the gym, I have a prescription for Dexedrine (which is an amphetamine, supposedly a big no-no for seizure people) ,oh and yeah the prescription is legit from my Dr. So yeah if I can do all this and am fine then I kinda feel like I shouldn't be applying for help you know? But then again if I miss more than 3 or 4 doses of my Depekote I almost definitely have a seizure and end up all busted up. It really scares me because what about when I move out and say my job doesn't have insurance? I mean I NEED Depekote or I'll be having seizures every other day like way before (I mean everyone knew me on a first name basis at the emergency room from me coming in after dislocating my arm during a seizure). Then there's the whole car/driving thing, another good reason for me to be moving to NYC. You don't need&nbsp;a car there, it's just annoying to have one in da NYC most of the time.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So yeah I'm gonna see what this lady says, and try to milk it for what it's worth because I sure could use help with funds for school and insurance and whatever else and if they wana help me then why not. Though of course being the air head I can be, I am still not 100% sure of the point of this visit&nbsp; or what we are trying to accomplish but from the bits and pieces my mother has told me and what I'm looking up online last minute this is what&nbsp;I get. </div>

I personally LOVE my platinum hair and don't want to part with it, but I wonder if it's considered too ""extreme"" by some places standards, especially on a boy (I know sexist!). Same thing with the undercut, is it too ""extreme"" for some places do you think? My bosses at Holiday Inn actually prefer it (I part all the hair to one side). I think it's because once my undercut actually grows a bit more, it's hard to make it look nice till its got some length, because my hair is naturally curly/wavy but I straighten it (thank the hair gods for Biosilk and my CHI straightener!!).<br /></font><font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""4""><br />GIVE ME YOUR OPINIONS HO'S!!!!</font> <br /></p>"

Why I have! 
YAY! 
And someone was gonna throw all this shite out and right it off! Thank gawd I intercepted it! Over $1000 dollah so far. 

Bah I really really need to get my fugging roots did, since my hair has been growing fast like woah since I started taking thoose hair & nail growing supplements. Only thing that is keeping me from going is, well I've been lazy lately about shaving my undercut so now theres about a quarter inch or less of hair all around or in other words my undercut is now dark dark brown. So I'm trying to decide wether I should reshave it (prolly will), bleach it along with my roots, or dye my hair on top the koldioscope of different shades of burgundy,chococlate cherry,dark dark red,maybe a tiny bit of black, and dark brown, but done professionaly so it looks suitable for work. Infact I think I'm gonna make a post asking all you ho's opinion!!"

A few days ago I had spent hours helping her electronically file her taxes, which was an extremely arduous task let me tell you. It would have been easier but she insisted on being the one typing everything out and clicking on everything and she is not very computer literate at all. She claims she use to be able to type extremely fast and was a secretary way back in the day when she went to school. Seeing her type now, I find that hard to believe. 

Hmm, how does one get their wpm typing speed? I remember we use to have software to do it back in like elementary school. I can't seem to find anything like that now, or maybe it's right under my nose. I know I can I can type fast (like a hyper active 7 year old w/out their Ridalin!) but it'd be nice to put an actual words per minute down. Though my spelling might bring down the number since spell check is my best friend. All you Ho's who talk to me on AIM know of my atrocious spelling, LOL.

"event","Warning: Total Bitch Fest!

Fuck fuck fuck, I'm supposed to be at work at 7 am so I get up accordingly (though I am NEVER scheduled for morning shifts ever) but the bus line I'd have to take doesn't run before 7 on Saturdays and my mother is in one of her moods where she refuses to give me a ride and goes on about how when she was my age she never asked people for rides and she had a seizure disorder also (though she seemingly forgets she lived in new York city not the suburbs!) ugh! I tried calling my supervisor to explain what's up, of course he's not in, he doesn't get in till 3. The only other person to call is the upper manager who isn't there on weekends on her cell phone which I'm not gonna do at 6:30 am. The shift they put me in doesn't even look like the one they would normally put me in, I'm going to call later and see if they need me for the evening shift, it seems like it's a huge banquet because absolutely everyone but me is scheduled for that (in the evening I mean).

 I know at a pointless meeting I had to attend the other day the boss (the one I don't wana call at 6:30 am) was asking how I was, thinking I was still sick. So I'm thinking maybe I was scheduled like that because this evening shift would last 11 hours and they thought I wouldn't be up to it?. I could take a cab to work but it makes absolutely no sense, with tip it'd be 20 dollars there, for like a 5-6 hour shift... it says till 3 but the time they have me in for is just that little brunch shift. Ugh if all this nonsense was happening in the evening I could of gotten a ride no problem but yeah not at 6:30 am. I'm not too worried I made more selling tons of hair dye/conditioning stuff on eBay , well more than my average weekly check. Though these are like whole sale lots of stuff so I mean this isn't common. 

If I knew how those people on eBay get all that stuff super cheap then resell it on eBay, I'd totally do that on the side regularly because I've already made more than $1000 off of stuff the hair supplier guy at the convention was just gonna trash and write off as extras. I still have a bit of stuff to go through too. I didn't post the auctions here because I doubted any of you really needed 120 bottles of hair dye, or 1 gallon bottles of conditioner. I kept most of the stuff that all you ho's woulda been all over heh :P like the bottles of biosilk, and a couple super pricey deep conditioners, and an extra chi (for when mine dies...  that thing is like my magic wand)."

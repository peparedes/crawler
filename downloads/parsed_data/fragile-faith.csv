"event","Originally posted by <lj user=""gabrielleabelle"" /> at <a href=""http://gabrielleabelle.livejournal.com/339685.html"">Mississippi Personhood Amendment</a><div class=""repost"">Okay, so I don&#39;t usually do this, but this is an issue near and dear to me and this is getting <s>very little</s> no attention in the mainstream media.<br /><br />Mississippi is voting on November 8th on whether to pass Amendment 26, the &quot;Personhood Amendment&quot;. This amendment would grant fertilized eggs and fetuses personhood status.<br /><br />Putting aside the contentious issue of abortion, this would effectively outlaw birth control and criminalize women who have miscarriages. This is not a good thing.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.jacksonwomenshealth.com/"">Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization</a> is the only place women can get abortions in the <i>entire</i> state, and they are trying to launch a grassroots movement against this amendment. This doesn&#39;t just apply to Mississippi, though, as Personhood USA, the group that introduced this amendment, is trying to introduce identical amendments in <i>all 50 states</i>.<br /><br />What&#39;s more, in Mississippi, this amendment is expected to pass. It even has Mississippi Democrats, including the Attorney General, Jim Hood, backing it.<br /><br />The reason I&#39;m posting this here is because I made a meager donation to the Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization this morning, and I received a personal email back hours later - on a Sunday - thanking me and noting that I&#39;m one of the first &quot;outside&quot; people to contribute.<br /><br />So if you sometimes pass on political action because you figure that enough other people will do something to make a difference, make an exception on this one. My RSS reader is near silent on this amendment. I only found out about it through a feminist blog. The mainstream media is not reporting on it.<br /><br />If there is ever a time to donate or send a letter in protest, this would be it.<br /><br />What to do?<br /><br />- Read up on it. <a href=""http://www.wakeupmississippi.org/"">Wake Up, Mississippi</a> is the home of the grassroots effort to fight this amendment. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/07/1023558/-Occupy-My-Uterus-My-Ass!-Fertilized-Eggs-Are-NOT-People!"">Daily Kos</a> also has a thorough story on it.<br /><br />- If you can afford it, you can donate at the site&#39;s link.<br /><br />- You can <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/contact"">contact the Democratic National Committee</a> to see why more of our representatives aren&#39;t speaking out against this.<br /><br />- Like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/WakeUpMississippiorg/237684486281516"">this Facebook page</a> to help spread awareness.<br /><br /><br /><lj-repost button=""And you can always push this button to repost on your LJ and spread the word"" /></div>"

"event","Well, the concert was fucking awesome. I'd never been to the Warfield, and even though Irene and I were in the back of the floor, we still had an awesome view.
There were a couple drunk guys right behind us for a while that kept falling into us, and then these two Swedish? Danish? guys that were like, 8 feet tall formed a nice barrier between us and said drunk guys. They were super nice and one of them really liked Irene's dreads lol! They were also taking recordings of the people around us singing along to the music during parts of the show, which I imagine sounds really terrible out of context!
The opening Band was September Morning, and they were really good! They sounded a lot like Kittie - well written badass music. I need to download their stuff.
Here's the set list as well as I can remember:
We're From America
Leave a Scar
The Beautiful People
Sweet Dreams
Four Rusted Horses
Irresponsible Hate Anthem
Pretty as a Swastika
Great Big White World
Rock is Dead
Little Horn
WOW
Tourniquet
And a few others I didn't recognize. I really was hoping he would play User Friendly, Coma White, Angel With The Scabbed Wings, and New Model, but oh well. All in all it was amazing and I'm totally seeing him next time he's in the area.
Now I need to shower."

"event","Those were the last words Grandma said to me on Tuesday night.
She had been in the ICU at Stanford for 10 days by then with pneumonia. The mitral valve in her heart was leaking, and short of surgery, there is nothing that can be done to repair it.
We were pretty used to regular hospital trips, many close calls and last minute scrambling to find her DNRs and lists of medications, and she would be discharged by doctors wondering how in the world she bounced back so hard. She'll be fine, she always is.
But she wasn't improving, and couldn't catch her breath if they took off her oxygen for a few moments. She couldn't eat or drink without choking and was given a feeding tube, which she absolutely hated.
She said she was ready to go now. She was tired of fighting and going in and out of the hospital, and just wanted to go home.

So we started to make arrangements on Tuesday for her to get home and start on hospice care. Everyone took turns visiting her one on one, saying whatever they needed to say while she was still awake and able to say what she needed back.
Mom called me at 9 on Wednesday morning - Grandma had asked that her tubes be removed that morning, she didn't want to wait to get home.
She was sleeping when we got there. My cousin who lives in Arizona said goodbye to her while her mother held her cell phone up to Grandma's ear. They asked us to leave the room while they removed the feeding tubes and oxygen mask.
When we got back, her oxygen saturation had dropped to 60%. Mom, Nana, Ginny, Terri, and I stood around her watching her heart rate slow down and blood pressure continue to drop. After 15 minutes, everything had slowed to 0 and she finally stopped breathing. It was 11:15 am.

It felt like we stood there for hours, going between disbelief and complete sorrow. The chaplain came in and said a beautiful blessing for her. Eventually we gathered up the few things of hers in the room - none of us wanted to be there to see her taken out of the room.
On the way home, Terri mentioned that Grandma and Grandpa's anniversary was August 12. They would have been married for 73 years. We don't know if Grandma knew what day it was or if it is just one of those strange coincidences.

So what now? I find myself asking that constantly. Christmas is going to be...I don't even know. She would have been 93 this year. She was pretty much the only reason half my family still showed up for holidays anymore. She knew that, too - she told Nana to keep the family together (no pressure or anything.) I don't even know what I should be feeling at this point, I've never lost anyone close before. I was 5 when Grandpa died and I wasn't close to uncle Kurt or Kenneth. I just don't know.

Instead of the hydrangea tattoo I had been planning, Mom came up with the idea of getting a hummingbird. They were Grandma's favorite birds and she had feeders hanging outside the kitchen window for as long as she lived there. So the girls of the family - Mom, Crystal, and I, and possibly Terri and Nana, are getting hummingbird tattoos. Mom even told Grandma about it - she said she was going to get it right next to her hydrangea tattoo she got for Grandpa. Grandma said, <lj-cut text=""then I'll always be with you.""><a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v202/fragile5900/me%20and%20friends/?action=view&current=100_0546.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/fragile5900/me%20and%20friends/100_0546.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a></lj-cut>

It's really hard to imagine this family without her. She raised 3 generations of us - 6 of her own, countless grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and even had 2 great-great grandchildren. What do you do when you lose someone like that?

Now what?"

"event","Inspired by<lj user=""collectingbees""/>, here are my reviews of the 3 most recent albums I've acquired:
<lj-cut text=""Eminem - Relapse"">
I'm not going to go into song-by-song detail simply because I've only listened to it a few times. So here are the Pros and Cons.
Pros: Has a good chunk of great songs. The better ones are My Mom, Insane, Bagpipes From Baghdad, and Must Be the Ganja. Has skits tossed in like his albums typically do, so no surprise there. Overall some really good tracks with some slightly new sounds.
Cons: WTF is up with his voice?? Suddenly he sounds like a 5 year old from Brooklyn or something, I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's definitely odd and at times annoying. Dr Dre and 50 Cent guest on a track that is probably the worst on the album.
Overall thumbs to the side. A lot of hits but a lot of misses as well.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Marilyn Manson - The High End of Low"">
<b>Devour:</b> Thumbs up. One of the mellower tracks on the album, and one of my favorites. Sounds like a partially acoutsic version of The Last Day on Earth.
<b>Pretty as a Swastika:</b> Thumbs up. Sounds like classic MM, loud, angry and hard.
<b>Leave a Scar:</b> Thumbs up. Warning: will get stuck in your head but you won't mind a bit. Would make a great single, I hope he releases this one.
<b>Four Rusted Horses:</b> Thumbs way up. My favorite track on the album. Has kind of a mellow western-y feel without being corny. Not for the masses, but fans will dig it.
<b>Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon:</b> Thumbs down. Sounds like he tried too hard on this one. A mashing up of The Beautiful People and Rock is Dead. Given how those are some of his better songs, I'm not sure how this one ended up such a turn-off.
<b>Blank and White:</b> Thumbs down. Nothing special here, move along.
<b>Running to the Edge of the World:</b> Thumbs to the side. I really want to like it more than I do.
<b>I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies:</b> Thumbs up. Decent track, but nothing amazing.
<b>WOW:</b> Thumbs up. Angry and passive-aggressive. Love it.
<b>Wight Spider:</b> Thumbs to the side. Nothing particularly memorable.
<b>Unkillable Monster:</b> Thumbs up. Lyrics are better than the music though.
<b>We're From America:</b> Thumbs up. The token social commentary track on every MM album, but it is pulled off well.
<b>I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell:</b> Thumbs to the side. Would have been a lot better without the cliche phrases about falling from grace.
<b>Into the Fire:</b> Thumbs up. I wish he had ended the album with this one.
<b>15:</b> Thumbs up. Decent track, but would fit better in the middle instead of the end of the album.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Tori Amos - Abnormally Attracted to Sin"">
<b>Give:</b> Thumbs way up. I can't stop listening to this one. Sounds like Spark mashed with Cruel, only creepier. I think if someone suck up on me while listening to this I'd jump out of my pants.
<b>Welcome to England:</b> Thumbs up. It took me listening to this one several times before I actually liked it. I wish my DVR hadn't cut off half her performance of this on Leno :[
<b>Strong Black Vine:</b> Thumbs up. Powerful and hard.
<b>Flavor:</b> Thumbs way up. My favorite on the album. Her voice is absolutely perfect, I think the decision to not use vibrato on this one was really smart.
<b>Not Dying Today:</b> Thumbs down. Corny and immature and totally out of place.
<b>Maybe California:</b> Thumbs to the side. Doesn't have the hook that her better songs have. Case where the lyrics are better than the music.
<b>Curtain Call:</b> Thumbs down. Nothing memorable.
<b>Fire to Your Plain:</b> Thumbs up. I can't put my finger on why I like this one unfortunately.
<b>Police Me:</b> Thumbs down. Again with the corniness, Tori? Feels like it was written over a bowl of cereal.
<b>That Guy:</b> Thumbs down. Not digging the cabaret thing going on here.
<b>Abnormally Attracted to Sin:</b> Thumbs up. Took a few listens to really get it. Reminds me a lot of The Beekeeper, very ethereal and sweeping.
<b>500 Miles:</b> Thumbs down. I can't help but hear The Proclaimers, and I doubt that was the intended effect.
<b>Mary Jane:</b> Thumbs up. Playful and catchy, though a bit out of place.
<b>Starling:</b> Thumbs way up. The birdlike sound effects, madrigal style, and beautiful lyrics, I absolutely love it. I can see this as becoming a classic for her.
<b>Fast Horse:</b> Thumbs up. Lyrics make me think it should have been on Scarlet's Walk.
<b>Ophelia:</b> Thumbs down. I know everyone loves this song but I just can't get into it. Sounds like something off Little Earthquakes gone wrong.
<b>Lady in Blue:</b> Thumbs up. Haunting and gorgeous, and a great ending.

"event","Since I have effectively pierced everything my job would allow <span style=""font-size: smaller"">(damn you, elusive labret! *shakes fist*)<font size=""2""> it's time for more tattoos. Here is Le Plan.
I've been contemplating a <a href=""http://www.typeonegative.net/index.php"">Type O Negative</a> tattoo for a while, I think I want something like <a href=""http://www.metal-observer.com/covers/cov8131.jpg"">this</a> but with just the symbol in the middle with the name wrapping around the top right corner. This one is probably next in line lol.
#2: Mom and I are planning to get some together when we go to Hawaii in October. We've been talking about getting work done together for a long time, but never really had an occasion. Here's what I'm planning on getting <a href=""http://www.moplants.com/gallery2/d/270-2/blue+mophead+hydrangea.jpg"">then</a>. My great grandfather grew huge, beautiful hydrangea plants for years and years, so this would be kind of a memorial for him - Mom has a hydrangea tattoo for him as well, so it seems like it would be a good choice for a mom-daughter type thing.</font></span>
#3: The Big One. A Dark Tower themed quarter sleeve. This one is causing me the most turmoil, since there are so many things I would like to have in it: <a href=""http://www.stephenking.com/darktower/images/book_covers/the_drawing_of_the_three/the_drawing_of_the_three.jpg"">the doors</a>, <a href=""http://www.thedarktower.com/images/jcwiki.jpg"">Jake and Oy</a>, the number 19, Blaine the Mono (can't find the picture I want right now), and a ton of other stuff, but what I know I'll decide on is something more like <a href=""http://athensspringer.com/images/gallery/Alternate%20Roland%20and%20Tower.jpg"">this</a> or <a href=""http://www.comixconnection.com/uploaded_images/TheDarkTower.sm-794397.jpg"">this</a>. I'd like to get a quotation done as well, I'm still looking for the right one in the right font. One I'm very partial to at the moment is <a href=""http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=worn_manuscript_rou&page=1&nb_ppp_old=50&text=all+things+serve+the+beam&nb_ppp=50&psize=m&classt=alpha"">this line with this font</a> or with <a href=""http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=metal_macabre&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=all+things+serve+the+beam&nb_ppp=10&psize=l&classt=alpha"">this font</a>. I may get this one next, I'm not sure yet. I'll have to sift through dafont some more.
Man, where the hell am I gonna put all of this?!? XD"

"event","ALBUQUERQUE (CN) - A clinic nurse first removed her intrauterine birth-control device without permission, says the patient in a federal action, then told her that &quot;having the IUD come out was a good thing,&quot; because &quot;I personally do not like IUDs. I feel they are a type of abortion. I don't know how you feel about abortion, but I am against them.&quot;<br />The patient sued Presbyterian Health Services Rio Rancho Family Health Center and nurse practitioner Sylvia Olona in Federal Court.<br />The plaintiff says she went to Rio Rancho to have the strings on her IUD shortened.<br />The complaint states: &quot;As soon as Defendant Olona began speaking to (the plaintiff), she questioned her about her choice of contraception.<br />&quot;As Defendant Olona began the procedure, (the plaintiff) felt Olona pull on the strings of the IUD. (The plaintiff) felt a distinct pulling on the strings followed by a sharp pain in her uterus similar to a very strong menstrual cramp.<br />&quot;As that happened, Defendant Olona stated, 'Uh oh, I accidentally pulled out your IUD. I gently tugged and out it came.' She then explained, 'I cut the string than went back and gently pulled and out it came. It must have not been in properly.'<br />&quot;Olona then stated, 'having the IUD come out was a good thing.' She asked (the plaintiff) if she wanted to hear her 'take' on the situation. Without receiving a response, Defendant Olona stated, 'I personally do not like IUDs. I feel they are a type of abortion. I don't know how you feel about abortion, but I am against them. What the IUD does is take the fertilized egg and pushes it out of the uterus.'<br />&quot;Defendant Olona stated, 'Everyone in the office always laughs and tells me I pull these out on purpose because I am against them, but it's not true, they accidentally come out when I tug.'<br />&quot;At this point, Defendant Olona advised that (the plaintiff) needed to take a pregnancy test. (The plaintiff) did, and the test was negative.<br />&quot;Defendant Olona told (the plaintiff) that is was better that she did not have the IUD because she could now use a &quot;non-abortion&quot; form of contraception. Defendant Olona suggested the deprovera (depo) [sic] shot or the pill, and made clear that she would not insert a new IUD.&quot;<br />The plaintiff demands damages for battery, constitutional violations and negligence.

"event","&nbsp;is it totally insane to wish you had an addiction to drugs or alcohol so that you could have an entire community to connest to, like AA or NA? 

people all over the world that you can go to that understand what it's like to be totally cought in your addiction, at whatever stage, that you can go to that really GET it? 

nobody really understands my illness. nobody else judges their self-worth on the size of their jeans. nobody else doubts every single relationship they have, fearing in the back of their minds that everyone will eventually figure out that they are completely fucking insane and have gotten&nbsp;so adept at hiding it at whatever cost. nobody else is as suspicious of the people they love. 

there is really nowhere to go. EDA used to have meetings in los altos, but it was cancelled due to low attendance. how ironic! the very core of our disorder is being solitary; is keeping our true selves hidden. i found a group that sounded perfect for what i needed, but it costs $50 per session, once a week. fuck. 

so now i find myself wishing i had a place like NA. i grew up going to meetings with mom, hearing the stories of lives destroyed and captured again, stories of self reflection and discovery, stories of solitude and fear. i never really understood them until i became bulimic. and now i wish i had that kind of support. is it possible to develop disordered eating at age 6, bulimia at age 14, ED-NOS after a year of treatment at 18, a strange combination of the three after 2 years of treatment, and end up&nbsp;without the action but with all the same thought processes as you've had for as long as you can remember? the thoughts that nothing you do is ever good enough; that everyone you love will see what a horrible, selfish, lazy, boring person that you are and get as far away from you as possible. 

no one fucking GETS that. so how the fuck am i supposed to stop thinking like that when the people i love keep reinforcing it? 

...or are they? or am i so cought up in my own head that i purposefully twist situations to fit the scenario i'm used to? and if i even say something, say i'm unhappy or i'm hurt or upset by something someone did to me, that i feel betrayed and paranoid and unjustly fucked over, when it comes out of my mouth i just sound like i'm being totally irrational and bitchy so i wish i would just shut my own fucking mouth?

no. you know what? sometimes i do simply get fucked over and betrayed and people just don't have the fucking courage to say they were wrong."

"event","i've been doing a lot of soul searching the past few weeks, and i had an epiphany today.
you know the phrase ""you can't love another until you can love yourself""? i realized that i depend on the person i'm in a relationship with to love me FOR me, because i can't (or don't know how) to do it myself. i then become so dependent on this person to affirm what i cannot for myself; that i am a good person and i deserve to be loved.
i think this is why my relationships become so one-sided. i need to feel that affirmation so badly from the other person that it becomes draining on them and they feel like they need to either fix me or gtfo.
i realize most of my emotional issues are because i've always searched for some way to feel that affirmation. i still have to remind myself every day that people in my life will love me if i'm not a size 5. sometimes i believe it, sometimes i don't, but deep down i know it to be true.
ok, so if my weight isn't the deciding factor, maybe i just need to stop talking about all these insane thoughts i have about myself and maybe my partner won't know they're there. just pretend everything's ok. (i'm sure you know that doesn't ever end well.)
so i just keep latching onto my partner to keep me convinced that i'm worthy of their time and attention, that i deserve to be loved.
that's a lot to ask of a person.
so now comes the daunting task of convincing MYself of all those things. stop telling myself that i'm selfish, lazy, and completely mental, figure out what i actually like about myself, and try to find a balance between the two.

hooo boy."

Persistent sad, anxious, or ""empty"" mood 
Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism 
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness 
Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed
(from NIMH website)

sounds pretty damn accurate to me. of course my current situation is only making these things 100 times worse and i burst into tears about every 15 minutes. but that's beside the point.
the point is there's really nothing i can do at this point other than try to get myself better and try not to dwell on the fact that i told him my biggest fear was that he wouldn't want me back if i left and lo and behold, now he doesn't.
we're both pretty fucked financially at this point. he can't afford the place by himself, the lease isn't up until november, and i can't even afford a studio on my own. and all that might not even happen.
god i can't do this."

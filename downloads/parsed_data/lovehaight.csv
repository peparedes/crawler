"event","So I had to make a very important decision.. whether to do with Meghan and Tommy out... or to stay home with Reid. 

Both had tons of pro's and con's - the nice thing to do would have been to stay home with Reid... but Meghan and Tommy are my buddies, my pal's -- I couldnt just leave them hanging.

So I did what any normal person would do: 

<b><center> I consulted the magic eight ball</center></b>

Aparently it thinks I should stay with Reid without a doubt, he -will- be angry at me if I leave even though he said it's my decision, and yes my mother will bring me there. 

Yeah. This is why it took Lauren 18 years to get a kiss.

I atempted to get my license.. AGAIN! 

Dammit.. this time my rear tires touched the grass in a 3 point turn causing me to have an automatic diqualification.

Bummer..big time. Oh well... back to the old drawing board I guess. 

Im guessing the powers that be dont want me pregnant JUST yet huh?

Things are... ok with me now. I mean I think I can handle where we are at this moment. Things are better from what I can tell. I just need to remain calm, collected and try not to be a gomer..

I see him tonight I think ( hes starting Stans class.. ) I'm a little nervous - should that be normal?

I also think that I need to call that woman from FLSOTA and see if I can still get into her school.. god I hope so.

<center><B>Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry

So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

<b>[:screams ala Evelyn:] UHWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Oh my god would you guys cut it out??

UHWHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

See now this is the bad thing of having your sister and your girlfriend become attached at the hip...</b></Center>

Well I had a fun weekend. 

Friday:

KT and I got lost on our way to see Reid's show. More than lost actually, pratically on the other side of town and we were about 20 minutes late ( I missed some of Reid's glory) The show was amazing. Afterwards KT and I went out to eat and Matt's sister was our waitress.. heh heh..

Saturday:

I got up around 10 and had to be at Reid's house by 12 because his sister and I had a job to do. Soooooo once she got there we got dressed and headed down to a county club in boca for some kids Bar Mitzvah and we danced. We had this kick ass routne for Britney's Toxic... it was awesome. Made 100$ in 3 hours. WHOO HOOOOO!!!!

That night her and I went to go see Reid's show and I got to see the -whole- thing this time. It was amazing... any Northeast Kids who want to see it please tell me because I'm going again and I honestly think you should see it.. thats how wonderful it is.

After the show we went back to Reid's house and snoopy got attacked by something and a chunk of his ear was gone. So we called the emergency vet and all was well again. I ended up staying the night. Good times good times.

Sunday: Meghan and I woke up, went to church, went to Subway, Went to lessons with Norma, and then went Prom Dress Shopping.. well of course not for me. But for her. We found the most amazing dress because of her Karma which was bad at first but I fixed it.
<center><b> Wait a second... what about that 20 you found in the bathroom??

You think thats my bad karma?

Well it wasnt yours...

Well who else would have used it?

I dont know... buy me an ice cream or something...that will make the money alright. It will serve it's purpose in the universe.

Uh Ok... 

[ :10 minutes later we found her dress:] 

See I told you...

</center></b>

All that prom dress shopping made me kinda wanna go to Prom.. but dont tell anyone K? I have a rep to protect you know what I mean?

Alright now it's time to watch my awesome DVD's that I got in the mail.

The 60's and The Mists of Avalon... marcela I can't wait for you to come home.

Granted this man is living on my couch... but UGH! How dare him. 

Even as we speak he's sitting here calling me a douche bag and saying how I'm just like my father and no one loves me and that I'm going to die alone and lonley just like my grandmother is.

"event","Well this weekend was .. intersting. That's for darn sure. 

Friday I didnt go to school cause people forgot about me. LoL. Fun. That night was our Romeo and Juliet show and it was pretty darn bad. Like woah. I guess a break for the week definatly leads to bad performances. 

<b>Saturday</b> My mommie still wasnt home and my dog woke me up at 5 so I would take her out to pee. Do you know what its like to have your own DOG know that pulling the covers off is the only way to get you up?

So the day show went alright I suppose, not the best - afterwards we all ordered in and some of us took a little napsie. 

The night show RULED and was so awesome, and -nobody- taped it. Figures.

Since it was a full moon we had drum circle on the beach. It was awesome. We had a blast dancing with all the fellow hippies.

<b><center> HEY! You can't do that! Stop that Kyacking.. this is my beach and I say you can't do that! [ :begins running down twords the people :] HEY YOU!!!!! [ :runs back:] Alright ... she has an ore.. [ :jumps on david:] Their plummiting into the sea, I must stop them! Come Big Fat Black man, you can be my bouie!</center></b>

<b>Sunday</b>'s show was amazing. Julie kicked ass and I was so proud of her. People in the audience laughed, and they cried, and it was so much fun and it was the most wonderful show ever. 

The night show however draged on and on and on and never seemed to end. 

<center><b> MATTHEW EVANS</center></b> 
Is by far the sweetest guy I have ever met in my life. We've known each other not even a whole semister and he took the time to come and see my show. I can't even express how much that meant to me because someone who I really wanted to be there didnt even show. But not the matter... the matter is: Marcela you're boyfriend is so sweet and I can't even stress how much him being there meant to me. Espically since it was a really bad show. 

AND! Most importantly, I took him to dinner with a bunch of us 'theatre-kids' and the poor guy... I felt so bad for him because everyone was just being so ...  jeeze I dont know weird. And he kinda sat there not sure of what to make of it. Celaphane when you speak to him tell him I'm sorry again lol.

Well I must go and finish some homework because I'm failing English and Art class... how does one -fail- an art class?"

Well I was told that this helps, so here it goes. 

Dearest Allison, 

 I know you're in a better place and that should make me feel better but I cant help but think that I could have done something to help you. Maybe if I had gave out more flyers, or told more people that you may still be here.

I know if you were here you'd say. ""Stop being dumb..."" But I dont know how else to think.

When I found out yesterday at work I was heartbroken. I knew that something jut wasn't sitting right with me Monday Night when I couldnt stop feeling sad. 

All during work I kept thinking about you and thinking back.

You were my best childhood friend, and I'll always remember our Beacon Hill days. 

Thinking about our many games of spider web in the pool, our many spit games in which you kicked my butt, and knowing that that scar on my knee was from when we collided into each other during bombardamin. You helped me with the 'Love of my life' Billy Cole. 

I remember watching you get your breathing treatments but I never once realized how severe it was because you never showed it. 

Thank you for being a wonderful friend. Our late night IM conversations about Passions and 'Was Ethan and Theresa EVER going to get back together' And our livejournal comments back and forth will forever be plagued in my mind.

I remember the last thing I said to you was:

You Better get well soon Miss Allison, because you have to come and see me in 'Crazy for you' Because I'm 'crazy for you'.

Had I known it was the last thing I was to say to you I would have thought of something better to say.

All I know is that you were such a wonderful friend, and I know your not hurting anymore so I should be happy for you. I know now you -will- be at my show and I'll dedicate my performance to you because you are my

Well the first week of Romeo and Juliet is over and I still dont have my license.. whats that about?

I have tons of makeup work to do yet I dont have the drive to do it. I think Im depressed but I'm not quite sure. I just can't really find anything to be happy at any more.

Im so frustrated and I dont know why. I can't pin point where its comming from and that frustrates me even more. Im sick and tired of feeling this way too, I went from this happy-go-lucky chick to this depressed pile of kaka who dosent know what to do with herself anymore. 

Maybe because I havn't seen Reid. After all he was and is the only thing that could make me happy. I havent really seen him since Valentines Day and when he came to the show he left quickly, not before commenting on how hot everyone else looked or what a great job everyone else did. [ Sorry Im a jealous jealous girl who's trying to get over the stupid things that dont really matter ]  I think also my funk has alot to do with what Alex said to me when she was getting me into character. Granted Im so thankful that she did it, but holy shit I've never felt worse in my life. It was like she knew all my insecurites about our realtionship and said them to me. Freaked me out big time LoL [ :cries:]I honestly think thats why I'm in this nasty funk. Not having my license is another but god knows I've tried to get that damn thing and something always gets in my way.

No one can take me so I guess that Im stuck. AH well... all for the better I suppose.. theres always that 'big plan' that god has...[ :gags:] Fuck the plan, god mocks me.

He saw I was too happy and decided it was time to take me 12 feet out of the air.

And YES Im going to bitch in my live journal and then contract what I say at the end cause I'll feel bad that so many are suffering and my petty problems really don't matter.

I'm just so tired. Between School, R + J , Tap, and a boyfriend that I'm missing tremendously... ahg.. ok lets go through all my problems here and try and cope ( sorry... rambeling on to myself ) 

- no license, and no one to help me fix it
- missing boyfriend ever so much
- free tickets to ren fest and nothing to do with them
- romeo and juliet shit
- learning lines
- memorizing sonnet 
- F in English
- No time to make up the work I'm missing
- Salon is giving me shit and it's pissing me off, bastards.
- Greg is hot... sorry couldnt help myself, that alone is troubling for me.
-Tapping is giving me a headache because I can't get it the way I want to get it.
- Im sick of acting, Im sick of working ---- I just want to crawl into his arms and sleep for a little bit.
-My clothes dont fit me anymore and I can't buy new ones 
- I have no money and I work 3 jobs... not sure how that works
-Weird skin flaps are forming around my belly button ring and it isnt pleasnt
- My feet smell... bad

Now dumb ass.. lets look at all the millions who die every day, and who dont have parents, or food, or clothes, or shelter... who are getting their arms blown off because they were playing and stepped on a mine...certainly makes my problems just a little vapor in this world.

And I'm spent... gotta shower cause I smell"

I finished my art project today, didnt go as well as I had hoped. But its better than nothing I suppose.

Missing Reid, but thats nothing new... 

Atempting to find someone who will take me to get my license ( hint hint to those with cars hehe )

<b>[:sings:] Poor young rich boy...masturbates to a Vaudeville tart.

Whatchyou trying to say?</b>
[ Ragtime is the best play ever ] </center>

This wont be an entry about how I'm now intimadated by a little 15 year old prostitot... this won't be an entry about certain beings in the rain, and this CERTAINLY wont be an entry about how I dont appreciate some girls who feel the need to try and take my boyfriend from me when we have a perfectly good relationship. See I would have to stoop to a low level to make -this- entry about that. hehe

Hmm lets see... today was rather nice. I finished that stupid Art project and it turned out really nice. I was proud afterwards. Shealy's class was fun as always gotta love government. (PS I have Miss Justin Love's book! ) Hey did you know that if congress declares war that the President can make ANYTHING happen without anyone stopping him? Kinda scary no? I can just imgaine good old Bush in a pair of goggles firing missels. 

Lunch was alright. My usual date with Mr. Agnew. Gotta love that man. So we were talking and he said today we were learning about the show "" Oaklahoma"" and then he siad "" We're not doing it .. so don't worry"" I was trying to figure out what we were doing and he said he's still waiting for things to happen... I'm assuming administrater things perhaps? Man if we could go Chicago I think I would die a happy girl. I mean he definatly has the cast for it.. it could so work. Then again so could Cabaret but I remember him saying we couldnt... so my last hope if for Guys and Dolls which isnt that intersting of a play. Let me keep my fingers crossed for Chicago.

4th hour we learned all cool stuff about Oaklahoma.. sounds like a good show. Watched it with Hugh Jackman, what an amazing voice.

Went to work... left work, went to the other work... talked to the boyfriend who loved his little suprises that I left for him. That makes me happy. I love to see him happy. I should do more cute girlfriend stuff like that for him. Aw... heart. I love him so much that it's really unhealthy... but of course in a good way. Le sigh."

"event","Heya all.. hope everyone is having a wonderful day. Mine was rather borning

Substiitue in Mrs. Winters class today. She talked like Christmas Eve from Avenue Q. I was trying so hard to understand her too but it just wasn't working. 

Art class is still frustrating. This whole ""Lets-get-many-talents-on-your-resume"" thing isnt working. Im not an artist...

Shealy's class was fun, as always. I made him a Merry Unbirthday gift, which he shall cherish I know.

Drama went fairly well.. we took a Show Boat test, I dont think I did that hot on it but we'll see. 

As for rehersal. Anthony wasnt very happy. He accused all of us of having additdes. Which he was right I suppose. I was rather cranky today. I feel really bad too, just cause I didnt sleep dosent mean I should go to rehersal without a smile on my face. 

From now on I'm going to have lots of coffee before I go into rehersal.

Reid came and picked up his stuff... hope he likes his little suprises hehe God I love that boy...

<b>[:very dictator like:] ADVANCE, ADVANCE, ADVANCE

BALESTRA!!!!

NO! GO BACK AND DO IT AGAIN! NOW UNGAURD!

[:Kris is the only one that moves forward:] BA-LES-TRA! [ :stops and looks around as Anthony glares at him:] Well we only did one Balestra that time. 

Yes, well done... well done Kris. Alright everyone in horse stance because Kris wants to be a smart ass

Man Fuck that...

Kidding, Kidding.

Man I had the longest weekend known to man. It was rather sickening. Friday I cleaned up the costume cage with very dedicated workers. Most of them were -not- Thespians. Very awesome people though. Thank you guys oh so much. We still  have our work cut out for us however. I actually had a blast cleaning for the first time in my life. Zac turned out to be sooooo resourceful. He knows his costumes.

<b><center> Ok what about this one?

Hmmm I'd toss it in the Amish pile...
</b></center>

Friday night was dedicated to personal hygene.. god bless Nair no? I was getting out of hand so it was time for a clean up.

Saturday I was excited because I was going to spend the whole day with Reid but that kinda fell through. Oh well. 

SOOOOOO had conservatory, we ran.. ugh. I hate running. Am I the only one who thinks that you shouldnt run unless your being chased? We had a whole class dedicated to learning about money. I have a system now and I'm so excited.

No one showed up to Conservatory 2 so Anthony, Ben, myself, Kris, Lindsey, and David took an educational feild trip to Starbucks and also got some sushi. YAY!

Rehersal was so freaking -amazing- It wasn't even my rehersal but I decided to stay anyways and learned stage combat and sword fighting. OMG! It was so kick ass.. I know I'm all ""Make love not war"" But It felt so awesome to fight.

<b><center>[:I go to punch Kris in the head, he blocks me, He goes to punch me in the stomach, I block him and we fly away from each other I punch him in the stomach, then in the face... go to finish him off and he hits me in my sacred spot I elbow him in the face as he falls to the ground:] 

RIGHT ON!

MAN I FEEL LIKE BUFFY!!!</CENTER></B>

I was having sooooo much fun being Kris's fighting partner! I think we have good chemistry!

We learned how to sword fight kinda. We had to sit in this stance called ' Horse Stance' It hurts... very badly. Then it got to the point where whenever someone would talk ( aka mr. Benjamin ) we'd have to stand in Horse Stance. It sucked but atleast my legs are benfiting from it.

So that night we went to Dinner at Matt's bar and Kris and I played pool, and I tied more cherry's with my tounge ( thanks Destiny hehe ) Hey speaking of which.. I saw Andy there! I didnt say hi to him though... he looked plastered. ANYWAYS--afterwards I went back to Kris's house and slept over since I didnt have a ride home. It was fun! We watched Lord of the Rings. I've never seen it before so it was pretty damn awesome. Now I just have to see the other 2.

So today's rehersal was bloody, I'm exhausted since I went to bed so darn late, really regreting that I havent been taking care of my body and I cant stand in a horse stance without crying and I'm not looking forward to school starting tommorw...

Peace Love and LOOOOOONNNGGGGG Weekends.

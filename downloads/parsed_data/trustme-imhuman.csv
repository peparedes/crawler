I splurged and forced Tyler to enjoy the benefits.
We went to Red Lobster!

ok, so maybe it's not the biggest thing in the world, but I haven't been there in forever and was more than willing to spend the money on such good food. I made Tyler get a chicken and shrimp scampi dinner with a lobster tail on the side ;) The guy's gotta try the shit sometime. He seemed to like it... either that or he was being nice cause he knew how much it cost. I hope it's the former of the two.

We had some chipper waitress, maybe she was a little over the top, but it was a nice change from the horrible service that we got at Applebees the other night. I think we tipped our server at Applebees something like 5%. It was bad. 

The only thing that made the Red Lobster experience undesirable was the couple sitting across from us. I don't know if it was because they knew we were a gay couple or whether they we just going about normal conversation but the uber-conservative man was talking about trips and where he'd been. He hated California for one reason... ""It's too liberal"" and San Fransisco was a place he could never live because, ""They're all gays."" What a sad society we live in when people can't even tolerate others. Has no one learned anything from our past?"

"event","Christmas is over, it went well.
I got a ton of money, but it'll probably just go toward paying off what I spent the past year... at least most of it will. The best part of it was that my uncle is going to fly Tyler out to Philadelphia for my cousins bar mitzvah. It'll be nice to have him out there with me. I won't be quite as bored, and I know that if he wasn't there I'd get lonesome for him pretty fast. It's too bad we aren't going to have much time to check out the city while we're there.

Christmas at Dad's house was interesting. I finally came out to him and he took it much better than I expected. He was more worried about me possibly being manipulated by some guy into thinking I was gay. Makes me wonder what he thinks about my common sense abilities. I understand where he's coming from with that, but he seems to think I'm a 12 year old and easily manipulated by people.

On Sunday the same uncle that's taking Tyler to Philly took the family (step-dad's side, minus the kids, plus Tyler) out to dinner at Chino Latino. It was great, food was great. I'm glad that everyone likes Tyler, though I don't see why they wouldn't."

I've been out of commission for about 3 weeks.

I just had to get mono. The good news is that it's over with... the bad news is that I'm behind on my work. I gave it to Tyler too. :( not good, but at least he's over it as well. Didn't seem to bother him as much as it did me. Damn I always get sick now... I swear it's this house and the fact that no one cleans. I can't get to mad at others for not cleaning, say the kitchen, cause I know I'm not the best at that either, but it's not hard to pick up after yourself. I keep all my shit in my own room.... where your shit is suposed to go. Everyone else leaves their crap in the living room and kitchen and it gets messy fast.

Can't be that hard to get your shit to the garbage can it?

I feel that ""parties"" are starting to get to be a little to much for us to deal with. There's always a mess to clean up later, that's to be said with almost any party... but the person throwing the party never cleans up the mess.... hmmm. So we sit with pizza boxes on the kitchen table for weeks... alcohol bottles lying around the living room for longer probably. Either we need to have less parties or the person holding them needs to do their part and clean up afterwords.

I was starting to get a little irritated with Kari and Andrew staying over as much as they were. I'd wake up in the morning to find my cereal gone and my milk drank. It was just starting to get a little annoying and I was sick and didn't have the patience to deal with it... but whatever, they aren't over here much now anyway.

enough griping... I'm better and Tyler's better and Christmas is upon us... I should be happy."

"event","tidbits from the press:

Just as Zell Miller was so over the top at the G.O.P. convention that he made Mr. Cheney seem reasonable, so several new members of Congress will make W. seem moderate.

Tom Coburn, the new senator from Oklahoma, has advocated the death penalty for doctors who perform abortions and warned that ""the gay agenda"" would undermine the country. He also characterized his race as a choice between ""good and evil"" and said he had heard there was ""rampant lesbianism"" in Oklahoma schools.

Jim DeMint, the new senator from South Carolina, said during his campaign that he supported a state G.O.P. platform plank banning gays from teaching in public schools. He explained, ""I would have given the same answer when asked if a single woman who was pregnant and living with her boyfriend should be hired to teach my third-grade children."" John Thune, who toppled Tom Daschle, is an anti-abortion Christian conservative - or ""servant leader,"" as he was hailed in a campaign ad - who supports constitutional amendments banning flag burning and gay marriage.

But what troubled me yesterday was my feeling that this election was tipped because of an outpouring of support for George Bush by people who don't just favor different policies than I do - they favor a whole different kind of America. We don't just disagree on what America should be doing; we disagree on what America is.

Is it a country that does not intrude into people's sexual preferences and the marriage unions they want to make? Is it a country that allows a woman to have control over her body? Is it a country where the line between church and state bequeathed to us by our Founding Fathers should be inviolate? Is it a country where religion doesn't trump science? And, most important, is it a country whose president mobilizes its deep moral energies to unite us - instead of dividing us from one another and from the world?

Basking in the glow of re-election, President Bush said yesterday the nation is entering ""a new era of hope"" and vowed to follow through on his agenda in pursuit of America's ""deepest values of family and faith.""

<img src=""http://www.cyburbia.org/gallery/data/500/839new_map.jpg"">
 
This election was probably the most vicious in terms of character assassination. But it wasn't quite as scary as the fact that churches of all denominations crossed the line. 
Separation of church and state has never been a handicap, but one of the great strengths of our nation. The U.S. Constitution has guided us from a few villages in the wilderness to the most powerful nation the planet Earth has ever known. With the coming of the 21st Century, some want to change or whittle away at the constitution and its amendments. 
The Patriot Act cut into the fiber of its strength; leaders of our churches thought they were above it. Now, actor Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger would like to change it so he can run for president. 
Less then 250 years ago, the generals serving under George Washington wanted to make him king. Lucky for all of us, he thought it a bad idea, or no constitution would have been necessary. 
The United States has often been referred to as a second Rome, and it's said that we are heading toward our end. 
Julius Caesar said: ""Beware of the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind is closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and do it gladly so. How do I know? I know for this is what I have done. And I am Caesar.""
Every time anyone starts even thinking of changing or amending the Constitution, I get nervous. I think our founding fathers did such a superb job writing that document, it will serve the people well for another thousand years."

what the hell is wrong with me????
I didn't get my homework done for class today and thus didn't go to school. This irritates me. I'm not this kind of person really. I know I procrastinate just like everyone else in the world, but this isn't me and it's bothering me. I was fine in high school got straight A's for the most part went to class, never skipped, got my homework done on time, prioritized my activities do that I'd get my homework done at an appropriate time. Now what gives? Is it the fact that I'm on my own and independent? Or, is it just that I've grown tired of being such a good student? I'm still a perfectionist, and try to always do my best work and not cut corners. I just have issues with even doing homework now. It puzzles me, really it does.

Ugh. I never feel like I have time for anything! Where has all of my free time gone????

I didn't want this journal to turn into a ""poor me"" entry, but it feels good to talk about things, even if it means being annoying and pathetic.

I'm on Tyler withdrawls. He said we couldn't see each other till maybe Wed. and thought that sounds juvenile of me I still find it hard to keep my mind focused on other things, knowing I won't be able to see him for some time. I'm pleased with how things are going between us, but I'm worried that I'm going to start turning away my friends. I don't talk to Allison as much as I used to and I don't want that to be the case, yet I don't want to be rude to Tyler either and interrupt him when he comes over to talk to her or any of my other friends. This will probably change the closer Tyler and I get to each other and the more understanding of each other we become.

I still think my mom is having a hard time either coming to terms with the fact that I'm growing up, or that I'm gay. She seems happy for me, but then again, she seems slightly worried or nervous... I really can't put my finger on it, but it seems like there's an underlying emotion behind what she shows me. Oh well, she wants to meet him none the less.

Right now I'm hoping that I didn't get food poisoning from the dinner.... I had a bad stomach ache after we got done eating and today hasn't been much better. I'm guessing that it's just because I haven't eaten any rich foods in a while.

I've only gone one day away from Tyler and I miss him. Hope he feels the same though, I don't want to be too clingy if that's not what he wants.

I'm not going to play dumb and act like he's not going to read this, :)..... cause I know he will. The more I see him the more I like him, I feel comfortable... secure when I'm with him. I could just fall asleep in his arms. (that sounds really good right now) I swear I can still smell him even though he's not here right now. I'm glad that we're deciding to take things slow... I think it's worth it, and the more I know about him the stronger any bond that we form will be. 

He's going to make this a difficult quarter to say the least ;)

I'm registered to vote now. Someone came by the door asking for Nick, but he wasn't home. I talked to the guy instead, young guy.... about my age. He was with a Bush opposition group... was kinda nervous that he might be a little bit of a radical, but I know there are a lot of people that are much more aggressive about this election than I, not that I don't care... I do, I'm just more worried about what's going on in my life right now.

He asked what bothered me the most about Bush right now and I said the war. I should have said gay rights too.... Well, he had forms with him just for the people who hadn't registered yet like me, so I filled one out and gave it back to him. I'll have to find out where to go so I can vote.

Hmmm..... wonder what he would have done had I said I was voting for Bush.

I wish my roommates would vote. Melissa has to go to Anoka to vote, she makes it seem like it's soooooo out of her way. It's 30min and she always goes there to see her mom. I don't know what her deal is. I can understand Ben, cause he'd have to go to Milaca or some far place to vote.... you can probably change that though. Nick wants to through away his vote on Nadar I'm pretty sure, but he's not registered either so whatever. I hope the rest of our generation isn't as uncaring as them... makes me worry not only about this election, but also future elections.

I kinda broke it off with Travis... it's not like we were a ""thing"", the guy lives in Phoenix, we had just had some great conversations and it was seeming like I could wait to see him if he did come home, but I couldn't wait that long, and he kept making broken promises of coming up here. He's cool with the fact that I've found someone though, and still wants to be friends... that's all the farther it seemed things were going anyway.

Classes should be interesting this quarter.... Everything seems new and improved, fresh. I'm excited..... we'll see how long that lasts though haha. The computer labs have all new comps and they're starting this new thing where you can get a note to get out of class around 2-3pm to go to whatever group your in if there's a meeting or activity or something. Ethics might actually be fun.... I can't really believe I'm saying that, but it is quite possible that it'll be interesting. THe prof. is rather animated, you can tell he's into it, and that makes it a lot more enjoyable. Our final project for that class is to create an art piece that relates to an ethics topic in someway. It's only 5% of our grades, but I think it'll be a great end to the class. I have a 3d modeling class this quarter too.... The instructor is a total geek, but a cool one. He seems to contradict the natural laws of ""coolness"". There's a new instructor at the school who worked on a lot of major projects in Hollywood. Lots of big special fx movies. Probably won't get a class with him, different program, but it's still cool.

Ben is finally going to get me a bus pass. Yeesh, it was like pulling teeth with those people. I can't believe how hard it is to get them to do something nice for another person... yes it's not ""right"" cause you're ripping off Metro Transit, but it is right when you think that I'm spending $66 a month to their $55 a <font size=""3"">semester</font>. I could do a lot with that extra cash. I'll just have to pay out of my pocket until it gets here. Should be in a week or so.

I feel like a lucky guy right now... things seem to be going my way. :)"

Where did all that drive and motivation go that I had in high school? I've seriously skipped class way too many times this quarter. I don't get it. I had plenty of time to finish my homework last night, but I didn't, I didn't feel like it... and that right there scares me. Is it because I know I can get away with it and still get a decent grade in the class? 

Did I work myself so hard in high school... that now my body and mind needs a break? 

I need to know how other people are feeling.

Yeah...so I hate one of my bosses.... She's an old bitch, and while I would feel bad saying that a year ago, this year on the other hand is a total mess. 

Today I asked her if I could have next Saturday off. Now, I could understand her saying no if it was for something dumb, but that wasn't the case. I wanted the day off so that I could go down and visit my Grandma. She just got over a surgery on her hip and by accident the surgeon pinched her sciatic nerve. So, now she's in horrible pain, not getting any sleep and her pain pills aren't working. What ended up happening when I asked for the day off is Betty Ann telling me that I was going to be needed Sat. since it's going to be a sale day (trust me I wouldn't be needed, I can't remember the last day that I was put solely on helping customers....what a crock). Then she asked me how long the drive was, and I said 3 hours....that's 6 total driving hours.... So she asked me if I could do it Sunday, but it was more her telling me I had to do it Sunday. Sunday is the only day I have to get anything major done really. I was so pissed...

It isn't the fact that I couldn't get the day off so much as it's the fact that I don't feel like she cares about any of the employees. We could all die and she'd just get new ones. She doesn't realize how important some of the people are who work there. She's just a smitefull bitch.

AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH just so much unnecessary stress!!!!

I wish he was right in front of me....real....and gay. ;)

*sigh* I need to find someone....and I need more gay friends too. I guess I'm just lucky that I have some true friends that alow me to speak what's on my mind, whether it be guys, issues or whatever. I just feel so alone sometimes, like I'm outside of the action and looking in, like nothing is ever going to happen to me. Maybe I just need to do more.....I guess shit isn't always going to happen on its own.

life sucks and I wish I had someone to hug....."

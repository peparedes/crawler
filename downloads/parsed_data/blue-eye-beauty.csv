"event","driving in the car with michelle the other night after work, and she said the funniest thing i have ever heard. it is as follows:

the song 'holiday inn' by chingy is on the radio, and this line of the song comes on ""Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her""

as michelle hears the ""while I ram her"" part she says <b>""my entire vagina just cringed""</b>

and i have never laughed so hard in my entire life...hahahahahahhahahhha"

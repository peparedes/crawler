"event","I'll be honest with you, Keeli never really came off very well to me. I keep my mouth shut because I try not to judge people, but I feel that God give us discernment about certain people. I think that Keeli is one of those people that tries to get what she can from everyone else. You did the right thing, If I were you I would just keep my distance from her, she does not give me a good vibe. I'm glad that she has moved out, I thought she was more of a hindrance to you than a strength. I'll be praying for you.

"event","not to sound like your complete typical goth...*ahem* sawwa...jkjk lol.  
anyway...when you vent to people about how you feel its easy to just say well fuck it...""fuck him"" or ""fuck her""  sometimes it goes deeper then that, sometimes it just a huge let down and you cant help but feel sad.  when you spend time and effort to try and do your best and its just not good enough, it hurts.  i don't like to give up but i know sometimes we have to.  i feel like i have done my part and its just complete rejection.  its terrible.  today i slept most of the day.  just because i didnt want to deal with bs at all.  i was soo fed up and i just wanted to escape from it.  i dont turn to drugs or alcohol...i turn to sleep.  when i sleep no one can bother me.  
everyone see's me as the rescuer.  they come to me for advice and help, and thats fine i am glad to help.  but what breaks my heart truly is that when i just want a little in return i don;t get it.  its hard for me to open up and ask people for comfort and advice and a shoulder to cry on, so when i do and i am turned down its more severe.  it would have been nice to talk to someone about how my first day of work went.  it would have been nice to just share my thoughts and feelings with someone...as i did for them when they experienced new things.  i would sit and listen and see their tears or what not.  put a smile on their face after everything was said and done.  
i think gregg is one of the few who has done that for me in return...but he is on vacation until november and i miss him.  
i talked to pastor for a little bit today and it was nice.  
i am soo sad though.  i am not angry, just sad.  i dont care what other people think or what they say, i had wished for soo many things and had hope and everything was turning that way, and then major let down.  i used to be mad at myself and think of me as a fool and i dont even feel like that anymore.  i just feel great disappointment.  everyone can tell you what a great friend you are and how they adore you and love you.  i hear that everyday from someone...somehow.  i am always reminded how wooooooonderfly supposedly i am.  yet where are they all when i am like this?  
everyone is out for themselves, truly they are.  i dont know why i am always constantly reminded of the flawed evil natured  root of  human nature.  i know its there but damn does it always have to be shoved in my face?  
you let me down.  you hurt me pretty bad.  i never sought out to be a hero or for you to wait for me to come around or be at my mercy, but i lifted you up when you were down because i wanted to.  because i could not bare the thought of you falling and i promised not to let you fall...yet when i was slipping you did nothing.  even then i forgave you and gave you the benefit of the doubt and yet you still selfishly found some reason or excuse to why you could not be here for me.  i never asked for much in return, i only hoped for a true friendship where emotional support comes both ways without asking.  i guess that part of my life...the wish will not be granted.  not with you anyway.  your words were in vain.  promises broken.  

i am truly drained and tired.  even though i have not done much today at all.  i am gonna get some sleep."

"event","So since this is kind of my secret journal and all....I can talk about my real emotions here.  Where to begin?
Well...I finally expressed my feelings to my friend.  I can't believe that I am actually in love.  Hey you can't help it though.  
I really don't care what ppl think anymore, they can try and tell me AAAAAAAALL they want how he is not right for me.  But I don't care.  I really don't.  
He is not a druggie, alcoholic,  some loser, or an asshole.  I know him really well...being friends for 6 years and talking almost everyday.,....you tend to really get to know someone.  There is nothing I have to hide from him and there is nothing he has to hide from me.  
I guess because he's not some guy who works out at the gym 24/7 or drinks beer and tlaks shit all day long he is not man ""enough"" according to some ppl.  Well..whatever.  I am tired of ppl telling me what they think I need.  
I am happy now and thats what matters."

"event","I took renata to the vet, she got her shots and all that. she was very well behaved. but some ppl i swear are soo stupid. This guy comes out with his intact male and the male starts humping renata and im like she's not spayed. and the guy smiles at me, and im like i dont want puppies get ur dog away from mine..i had renata pulled as close to me as I could. 
Anyway, so my sister and grant came over last night, my sister was nice for once. I am tired of this like lets play miss cupid shit. why cant ppl understand i dont want a relationship. why can't they leave me alone about it....i am happy the way i am. 
And also...so yes I was with jon...but I was also with adam, jimmy, mike R, mike T, anthony, alex, ed, jon newcomb, ken, jason, jamie...and i forgot who else lol. They all look nothing alike. the two who look alike were alex and anthony...they were spanish and italian mixed. sooooooooo...for fucking sakes...I don't sit there and go ooh u dated that guy so your type is ONLY this. No i don't only date 17 year olds who are skinny and short lol...no i dont only date tall blonde swimmer types like ed, no i dont only date italian gladiator looking guys, no i don't only date older guys like jimmy. give me a break. Now everyone knows who i loved the most out of all the guys I have been with...he was very tall, big, athletic, long dark hair, brandon lee lookalike...fiesty personality, smart ass, very dominant...now does jon or alex or anthony or even the other jon look like that??? nooooooooooooooooooo. so get the fuck off it. Mike T looks like tarzan from the disney cartoon lol. so that doesn't mean i only want guys like that...i am soo irritated. 
Yes you can joke with me from time to time, but the shit gets old. I do like them younger then me, but i did make an exception for jon. When i was 21 i didn't really mind 18 or 17, the older I get the youngest i go for also gets older...im not a pedaphiler like michelle. so anyway....i dont have an ideal anymore...i wish my sister would understand that. I know she wants me to date that guy in denver with the pitbulls, but no. I can't even picture a guy for me...i get grossed out. I think of different looks and im like...bleh. yes even johnny depp looking guy...u know what no. I don't wanna compromise and you ALWAYS do to some extent when u are with someone. even if its a tiny little thing. If he happens to like a band I don't like guess what i don't wanna listen...if he bitches about mine...there is the door, I am not compromising thats how bad it is. down to every detail...so there for I will always be single because no one will fit, and if they have everything in common with me i will feel smothered..so there is no pleasing julia and julia wants to and shall be alone thanks ^_^"

Trivial rhetoric
A mother eats her son
A man fucks his dog
Step on a hornett's nest
Smash the looking glass

Abandon your 'Fayth'
Leave.

You'll take nothing."

"event","""It's really quite fun being mad,
You come up with the lovliest ideas.""
A Woolf said to the boy,
Before trotting tward the river,
Where Mrs. Delloway is throwing a party.

He puts a stone in one pocket
And his holy in the other.
Follow the Woolf.

Every second of every day
Of his entire life
Kiss his cheeks.
They gather into one unltimate hour.

They all walk to the river,
Where the instinct of survival
Is subdued by the need to be free.
The essence of life itself
Carries them all down.
The observer,
The Woolf,
Mrs. Delloway,
The hours,
All walk downward,
With the grace and stoicism
Of a funeral march."

The temporary solution.
A whirlwind of passion,
uprooting everything I work so hard to nail down.
A vapid pretentiousness leaving scars on my soul. 
The leech - The Shakespearian image 
of what she should be - of what we want her to be.
She is only of herself.
The leech - Slain, only to be ressurrected by need.
Dangling her bitter-sweet bread inches from my grasp.
Ingrid softly whispers, ""Loneliness is the human condition.""
Love, which is only anchored by the temerence of reality.
The leech, the oleander, the proverbial Siren - 
I hate you...
I love you..."

"event","the room resembled the feeling of an insane asylum...
Walking past the dust ridden chalkboards,
I notice that the masking tape simulating musical bars 
were slowly peeling off and the chairs of the ampitheater
seemed to stare back at me.
Walking still, bathing in floresant lighting,
we reach the Stienway, who looks like she's seen better days.
I pull the cover off with one gracefull motion,
and drape it over one of the haunted chairs
Once uncovered, her sight refreshed the angry room
I opened the back door and the pattering of the rain
somewhat defeated the purpose of a metronome
I returned to the piano and ran my fingers across it's milky keys.
my company sat down on the bench,
which felt like it was more like a pile of cinder blocks,
and started to play.
I took a step back to wait my turn.
her hands gently flowed over the keys,
not missing a beat, each finger connecting with an ivory.
she slowed down and politely finished the piece.
as she rose, I imediately took my place on the bench,
and straddled the corner.
my foot gravetated to the sustain pedal and rested there
as I slid my fingers into place between the sharps and the flats
I held my breath
suddenly an explosion of energy and emotion poured from my fingers
they played as fast as they could and ran from one end to the other.
my heart pumping more adrenaline through my viens 
with evry thrust of my hands.
the sounds roared from the piano
and billowed from it's chords
and swriled upwards twards the cieling 
now the room was babtized in atomic waves of joy
and pain
and fear
and nostalgia
and love
and hate
and fury
and finally, I let my hands slow down to the end of the piece.
the blood rushing to my head made the room spin,
and magnified it's dimentia.
I rose up in joining my company in leaving.
I didn't bother closing her lid, or covering her back up.
I might have been my efforts in keeping myself in the room,
either way...we left the room without looking back."

I don't care about anything.
Why should I?
There's no point.
I just don't care.
I guess i could care, if I cared enough to care,
But I don't really care all that much about anything.
I just don't see the point in anything.
Don't get me wrong, I look for the points,
But they're either not there or not ""sharp"" enough.
People also tend to give me shit for not caring,
But I don't care. 
They say I'm a slacker,
But I don't care.
They say I'm an ""issue"",
But I don't care.
When did the term ""care-free"" become such a problem?
I guess people are just going to have to get used to it.
But, of course, I don't care if they do or not.
Caring is overated.

I'll post it on here again when I change it.</b>

<b>intro: (a copello)</b>
get me a needle
to prick my deadened finger
I cannot feel
give me some novacain
to cripple and take away the pain
dope up my bruised up heart
to peel away the rotten parts
It didn't really hurt falling from heaven,
but it sure hurt falling from grace...

Thinking about you is quicksand
consuming everything that I have
you broke everything I am
Now I lay here falling arpart
trying to remember who you are -
gone but I still feel you breathing

<b>Chorus:</b>
Would you still hate me if I died?
Would I still hate you?
You took everything away 
leave me be
I'm burning
I'm burning
I'm burning

babies sleep on mommy's shoulders
just you wait until they're older
no one ever stays the same
I spit at mirrors, but it's not an issue,
just remove the hateful tissues
someday I could die alone

<b>Chorus</b>
('I'm burning' 4x)

<b>Bridge:</b>
arsonist, you make me hate everything 
make me pure again
oh, make me breath

light a match and take it all,
drown myself in alcohol,
choke on every dream you ever had
I'm on fire and I'm burning
trying to keep you from returning
keep myself away from you

<b>Chorus</b>
I'm burning
I'm burning
I'm burning
leave me be
I'm burning...
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire......"

Jeeze, I can just feel the hate mail coming from this poem now, haha. Oh well, freedom of expression has a price.</b>

<i>PUNK IS: the personal expression of uniqueness that comes from the experiences of growing up in touch with our human ability to reason and ask questions. 

PUNK IS: a movement that serves to refute social attitudes that have been perpetuated through willful ignorance of human nature. 

PUNK IS: a process of questioning and commitment to understanding that results in self-progress, and through repetition, flowers into social evolution. 

PUNK IS: a belief that this world is what we make of it, truth comes from our understanding of the way things are, not from the blind adherence to prescriptions about the way things should be. 

PUNK IS: the constant struggle against fear of social repercussions.""

-Greg Graffin of Bad Religion</i>

<b>here's mine</b>
PUNK IS: an interrpersonal expression of a ""uniqueness"" of sorts that comes from feeling insegnifigant and out of place and not having the balls to be yourself, only a lesser, more commercial vesion of it.

PUNK IS: a so-called ""movement"" that serves to express a kind of group-angst that is more based on being the bane of a social higherarchy rather than expressing any kind of personal opinions. Because, after all, opinions are overated. 

PUNK IS: a process of striving to be a part of something after every social catagory has chewed you up and spit you out and you resort to the hypocricy of calling yourself an ""anit-conformist"" to fit in with all the other whiny rejects who think reffering to themselves as something different is going to give them a voice. I think not.

PUNK IS: being ignorrant to the fact that people STILL don't like you, even if you wear checker print clothing, act like an asshole, and refer to everyone who isn't like you as a ""poser"", thereby self destructing your dreams of society being more accepting and less ignorrant. Good job.

PUNK IS: liking the 80's way too damn much and thinking that strumming on a guitar or writting bad poetry makes you anything more than mediocre."

on a path to nowhere. 
I briefly think of calling him,

This is based on inside jokes and events that have happened in the history of our friendship. It's an ongoing poem.</b>

We've been through so much together.
Happy times, sad times
Laughing times and crying times
And times we laughed so much all we could do was cry.
Together, we've braved the caotic streets
Of San Luis, searching for rare, lost treasures,
After feasting upon the delicious bounty of Wookstocks. 
We've perfected the art of Inward Piano Playing
And mourned the loss of worker Number One-Zero-Four
(Who will always be remembered for his individuality.) 
We've traveled on a pilgramage to praise the Piano Goddess,
And worship with her ear-shaped clergy. 
We've been through such things as 
Dicovering the microclasm of perfection
And experiencing it's sweet, yet sour high,
Helpful Chain-Monkeys,
Gay Saloons,
Strange methods of CD cleaning,
C-H-E-E-S-E-A-N-D-O-N-I-O-N-S (oh no!),
Exploding back-left tires,
Venturing into Yokoland,
Politically correct Charlie's Angels,
Last strands of heterosexuallity,
Former consulting buissnesses in Indonesia,
Disturbing Datura sounds,
Cornflake Girls,
And Raisin Girls,
And girls who, might someday, be their own.
I've had more tears of joy with you 
Then most people will have in a lifetime
Your the Bonnie to my Clyde,
The Cher to my Sonny,
The Lucy to my Ricky,
The Yoko to my John,
The Tina to my Iyke (oh wait, that's a really bad annalogy) 
You're my hetero-platonic life-partner
And you deserve nothing, but the best
Pick out your cloud

When I write, I try not to dwell on emotions like depression or rage or dispair, because it's so easy to do and I think poetry shouldn't only be about that. Just like it shouldn't just be about love or happiness. This is one of my sad poems. I also think that the concept of drowning in your own tears is very...what's a good word...though-provoking, maybe. It's also very metophorcal. Think about what the metophores are. There's no real ""right answer"" here.</b>

my tears flow freely and shamelessly to the ground
as they pool around my feet, they breed a sea of ripples.
the room fills with water and I am carried to the cieling.
as the last bit of air is swallowed by the waves
I am left to drift in a numb wieghtlessness
my limp body sinks downward 
to lay amoung phantoms of footsteps
and what once was my sanctuarie.
as I exhale once final time, 
I watch the carbon billow form my nose and mouth
I turn my head to the ground 
and see the faded photograph 
of a faceless being in a black suit.
my heart swells with pain,
and my lungs fill with an icy sting.

Alright, i noe im a bitch and whore and a messed up friend, but ppl can stop telling me, such as christian, and jackie and daniella. Onli jackie has the right to remind me every sec. of my life about it. I mean like seriously, just shut the fuck up. And ppl have sed i've changed since i've been going out with kyle, no way. And if i have in neway its been be4 that, cause ive felt so fucking left out, and not emo alright. Daniellas rele a hypocrite, idk even noe wut i think of her nemore.I dont even noe wut ppl think of me nemore. This whole fakeness thing isnt working for sum people, so go ahead tell the truth. Like no one understands, its fucking frustrating. JUST FUCKING TELL THE TRUTH jeez. I cant even tell if jackies my friend nemore, and she cant tell if im her friend, now thats just sad. Oh and highschool isnt easy to decide nemore. I keep changing my mind. I cant go to a catholic all girls school.I must be crazii. Girls are so bitchy, i mean just look at me.I cant spend the next four years being left out agen. The next four years with daniella and jackie, confused, being bitchy and whorish. I cant do it. I wish i put goddamn Fort Hamilton first. But now im stuck between Goldstein and Fontbonne, and ofcourse everyones gotta make everything complicated. ITS MY FUCKING LIFE. Give me a break.I wish i had the guts to tell every1 this, i try to be as truthful as i can, guess its not working, its not getting thru their thick skulls. Lemme sleep the day away, thats wut i did yesterday, and it worked. Home schooling is so simple."

Then me and jackie got the brilliant idea of going to his house at 3 in the morning. So I talked to him till like 3, and we left the house, but then he said it was too late and hed probably be in deep shit if he left the house. Me and jacks only went so far, and then turned back to her house. The next day me and jacks hung around, and then i went home and did boring shit like hw. And today was boring but we did get to make penguins, and while i was waiting to get my sketch checked i wrote i <3 aj, all over this piece of paper. That was amusing. So now here i am, prty bored, but we hav off thursday, so nothing matters yay!!! l8er"

BLINK 182 LYRICS

""Carousel""

I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel

Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitudes a reason to die

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile

A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone"

""Dysentery Gary""

Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucken weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver, tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucken weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy who took and ran away
He's a player, diarrhea giver, tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag
Fuck this place, I lost the war, I hate you all, Your mom's a whore
Where's my dog?
'Cause girls are such a drag"

""Online Songs""

Josie, 
you're my source of most frustration,
Forget when
I don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know, you weren't the only one (two three four)

Why do you still keep it around when you know it brings me down 
I'm hating everything.
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why 
you'd leave it out for me

Why am I still hanging around,
When I know it brings me down, 
I'm hating everything.
And you are getting rides home in his car
Making out on his front yard 
I'm hating everything.

Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end.
And I am not fine,
Last night I saw you online, 
your screen name used to be mine,
why can't we just pretend?

And if we can have another day,
I've got so much left to say,
I'd tell you everything. 
And I'll laugh when I think about the past,
When I see you after class you're hating everything. 

Please don't remind me 
put your past behind me 
it shines so bright it blinds me 
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine 
Last night I saw you online
your screen name used to be mine why can't we just pretend
[x2]

And she said,
Na (x11)
""I just forgot you were there""
Na (x11)
""I just forgot you were there""
Na (x11)
""I just forgot you were there""
Na (x11)

Please don't remind me 
put your past behind me 
it shines so bright it blinds me 
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine 
Last night I saw you online
your screen name used to be mine why can't we just pretend
[x2]

And she said,
Na na na na na..."

"event","These are like the bestest lyrics, for the bestest song lol even though it is from last summer.


Inspiring, shining, rising
And when you're in my way
I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together
Perfect in its splendor like the currents of the weather
The splinter in my center hindering all of my pleasure
Is me manifested as you in this endeavor
Once responsibility is taken I can render
Experience to be however I want to remember

Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios
Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go
It's all for the character and the aroogant afterglow
Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth
And what your parents handed down to you to handle
Make sure you carry torches when they're puttin out your candles
Prediction can be unkind but unwind them still
Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are 
But you cant keep running away from what youre tryning to find
Well I've seen you and those things you do
And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you
Your dark defines your light


There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with 
And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift
When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to life
I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist
Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed
You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist
And there's no way to get back experiences that you missed
So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are 
But you cant keep running away from what youre trying to find 

Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are(2x)

But you cant keep running away from what youre tryning to find(2x)"

I was so sleepy last night, so i ate brownies at midnight to stay awake for no reason(im just a night person). Then I read my book all night till i got sleepy, then i watched tv, and at sum point i went to sleep. I had a dream but i forgot it. My brother woke me up by telling me i had to get a blood test, i was rly confused this morning, didnt even noe wut day it was, but then i realized the blood tests werent till tmr. When i git up I had black and blues all over my legs, in the words of kyle, owwiiieee lol. I didnt bother telling my mother cause she wouldve said i hurt myself on purpose, sorry mom im not samantha, i wouldnt do sumthing like that. So, I took a shower and my whole body hurt, especially my hip bone cause my belt i wore all day yesterday was pressing on it(cause my hip bone sticks out in the front, that rly amuses me, especially when guys hav that lol). Anywayzz i went to 86th street, and me and mom decided to look at the dresses for fun, cause my uncles wedding is in october( i cant wait to get a pretty dress lol). But then after awhile my mom started saying how people thought it was mean that my cousins and sum other kids were in the wedding but i wasnt. I just nodded along(i noticed today that i blank out ALOT, that rly cant be good). She said that people think that inside i feel sad about it, but im just not saying anything, again i just nodded, cause nods can mean anything. Okay so truth is, i do care, and maybe i am sad. I dont even like my uncles fiance, i pretend to, cause thats how i am. I dont even wanna go to the wedding, i actually had a choice, i dont have to go, but w/e, i am. I complain alot. I also can never stand still, its very weird, i havent noticed till now. I was in a store and i stopped biting my nails, and then i didnt noe wut to do so i started swining my arms and stuff trying to figure out other stuff to do. I gues they're nervous habits, although i dont noe why i was nervous. Its annoying but i cant stop, its addicting like a drug(that cant be too good either). Today ive had a lot of time to think and i realized that the only dreams i remember are nightmares or weird ones, but sumhow they symbolize sumthing. Jackie, domi and i were talking about that on the way home from the game on wednesday. So anway i think ive said alot so later."

First I was bored cause no one was there, but then kristen came, and then BECCA!!!! yay lol. So anyway, the pool was extremely cold but we stayed in and tried to get this stupid ball from jonathon, george, john, and lucas. But then becca got out cause of the coldness, but me and kristen didnt give up trying to steal the ball. John musta thought we were rly stupid cause he kept pretending to throw it lol, and then hes like almost putting it down his pants lol. Then me and kristen kept trying to hold back the boys, like to hold her bro george back  we were like aww ur so cute ur cutey wooty lmao it was so funny, then I just grabbed jonathons arm and hes like wut are u doing and he starts dragging me along lol, but when i held john back in the deep end he goes if u dunk me ill dunk u so i didnt do anything to him lol.  And so after awhile we got out, and later on me kristen and becca went to the park with dana(and lets gues who was there haha the annoying group who i found out kristen hates too). Then we played tag, and the boys kept tagging eachother so it wasnt very fun, but there was alot of screaming lol. Then when we got back everyone started leaving. So kristens mom drove us home, and apparently johns mom thought i was in high school lol. And now im gonna relax cause that tag rly got me tired lol craziness on the slide. Later."

In his ledger he wrote of the antediluvian days, before all this: a more gullible, loose-toothed, pyromanical time when black widows and king cobras were bloodthirsty beasts, when stuffed cows were pals, and sex-even a handjob-was as far-fetched and grandiose as jet packs or pots of gold. But those days had passed, he knew.""

 ""Henry jumped. The eggbeater clanged on the carpet. In the middle of the floor, surrounded by candles, lay Henry's special cow, freshly shorn and spread out on a pillow, its face wrapped in cellophane, its hooves bound with shoelaces. The perpetrator left no note, but Henry had a pretty good a idea. A monster, indeed.""

 ""I almost just called you 'Honey,'"" he said.
 ""Old habits-""
 ""I was gonna start my sentence with 'Honey.'""
 ""And what would I have said?""
 ""I don't know.""
 ""I had habits, too, didn't I? Pet names, pet peeves...""
 ""You had a lot of pets, "" he said."

I started to panic, looking all around my room for some reason, and then I spotted the door, locked, and I realized I was sitting on my bed choking with the door locked. I don't wanna die, alone, in a locked room, panicked. 
 My biggest fear is dying alone, and watching everything happen, by myself, and regretting every single little thing right at that moment. Thats why I'm afaid to cross the street and go out by myself. I know its sad, but I just dont want to die alone. To have to face my biggest fear, by myself."

Well I was having this dream about my family, where I had just came home from sumwhere(it wasnt home it was like a vacation house on a hill, with the water below) and everyones like hey emma, and then they all started debating on how you prenounce my name, and i was just like i dont even know how to say my name ok!!! And then we were eating dinner outside and remember this is a vacation house, but i heard my house phone ring, and i was like to my mom, u took the phone here!!??? and shes like huh? and then my brother wakes me up and goes emma phone and gues who it was. SAM! and it was like 10 in the morning and shes like oh did i wake you. And she had nothing good to say so i was pretty mad, considering it was one of those mornings when i feel extremely nervous so i decide to sleep in late to avoid as much as the day as i can. So then I went online and stuff, and later on I read my book which is awesome, its called the every boy, i luv it. Then later on, my mom got mad cause I wasnt getting off the computer when i had to leave but finally i did. And then she got me so mad cause she was like complaining the whole way to vesuvio about jen and brian and then this girl passed by with a belly shirt and she goes hoochie and im like god your so retarded and shes like no you are, and im like no you are(u get the point lol). So then we got to vesuvio and I got to see ROB SIZZLE, and HOT WAITER GUY lol. SO anyway, Im jealous of my cousin jessica cause shes gonna learn to skate and shes been to TWO CONCERTS and ive been to none, and she plays guitar.And shes only eight! And I think my family thinks Im weird lol. My gonna be aunt cathy( who I will not want to call aunt, because my other one meant so much to me, well, I dont think she likes me, cause Im not very talkative. I dont even wanna go to their stupid wedding, which im not in, but my cousins are, but there might be hot guys there and i get a nice dress so ill go along and act happy. But I love my uncle so I'll go for him too lol. My dads embarrassing for sum reason, that I will figure out one day, but for now he just is. My grandma, I think she secretly thinks Im weird and stuff, but w/e I can deal with that, considering I call myself weird. Maybe shes the only thats notices I actually have problems, in my head, ya noe lol. And then theres my grandpa, who reminds me of the dad in big fish, and that makes me cry for sum reason. It makes me cry when I think about how I probably don't have enough time to bond with my family.... and how i don't hug good bye.....and how I'm weird and dont talk and dont hug and dont look waiters in the face and how i regret every single thing I do. I hug my friends more than my family, and apparently I give good hugs. So now Im here biting my nails as usual wondering about what could be wrong when everything i so so right."

The only one that has read like everything in it is jackie, cause i trust her. I love my journal. You know who I really love though, my cat. And not the big fat one, the little skinny one. She reminds me of me. Always looks frightened, likes rock, and only lets certain people know the real her, and only certain people figure out the real her. Thats was deep, very gay, but deep.

"event","California's just a big blur. The things i remember the most are the fights, sum of them word for word, sum again just a blur. Brian and I were always fighting over the camera, and about how his face looked like shit cause of all the cuts on it, and how he was ruining the trip cause of his sleeping. That was just the first day we were there, then we didn't fight again till the next to last day, cause he said we never get to do what he wants, and that I'm spoiled and I always get what I want(true). Then like the first day we used to car, my dad put on the parking brake and couldn't take it off, so again another fight. We pulled over and my dad couldn't fix it, so my mom got out of the car and left, but as i suspected she came back awhile later. But when she did she told me to get out of the car and that we'd take the bus(i noticed that she only told me that, not my brother, she specifically said emma),but being me I didn't get out. So my dad called the rent-a-car place for help. Thats when i remember sumthing word for word. My dad was on hold and so my mom was like ""why dont you call the other number?"" and my dad said ""why dont you shut the fuck up"". By that point I was scaredish(new word) cause my dad never curses. But anyway he got through to the place and fixed the car, and we were off. Oh then there was a night when we went out to eat, and we were looking for a place, and i rly have no clue why my mother got mad, but again she left(as usual, its rly a pain in the ass) and she went back to the hotel. So me and my dad and bro had a peaceful dinner without her, and after we looked into this club, which we would never do if my mom was there. Yeah so anyway, when we went back to the hotel ofcourse she was mad, and she hurt me and my feelings lol. Cause i was sitting on the chair right and she grabbed my arm and pulled me up but my hair was laying on my arm so she pulled my hair too, and she told me to sit sumwhere else. Then she randomly starts screaming at me, shes like and grandma thinks ur annoying too(she always has to bring up sum1 elses opinion). And so Im like no she doesnt and shes like fine but she thinks your weird, she wants to know why your always biting your nails and acting like somethings wrong(ouch....I think that might've been one of those times when im like I know its true but i cant admit it). And then she made me go to bed early. There were all the other fights too, but I dont wanna bore you. So when I remember happy times in Cali, I'll write about it.
Later"

"event","I feel like I'm absorbing water. I keep drinking but the thirst never quite goes away.

Yesterday night I read my book from about eleven to twelve. When I stopped, I felt like I was about to puke,freezing, not bothering to get the blanket. I dont know why, but I just sat there, on my bed, eventually getting up to go to the bathroom. When i looked in the mirror it was creepy, I was pale, and my eyeliner was smudged, i looked almost dead, and the world seemed dead to me last night, Even though the lights were on and I could here a bit amount of noise, it was like I was dead inisde, and so in my head, i made the outside dead too. Sometimes I can stop time if I try hard enough, well not rly stop it, just make myself think I have, make it look like I have. So when I went back to my bed I peered out my door and saw white, the white walls outside that reminded me of a hospital. It made me think back to the time I went crazy at sams  house thinking my whole life i might just be in acomma, maybe everyone wasn't real, maybe I had already missed my chance to come back to life and I was stuck here, heaven or hell(still not sure which). Or maybe I just try and deny everything in life until I finally have to face the truth. And maybe I just had to face that this is my life, and I can imagine all I want, but nothings gonna change it. 

You know wuts interesting, to look in the mirror, to look into ur eyes and try and see beyond wut ur seeing if that makes sense.

Im starting to flip out on myself. My whole life could be a lie. Did you ever realize that we never truely know who anyone is. They could be one big lie, or one big truth. I'll never know will I?"

"event","Today I have to go to the dentist, and right now i feel like crap cuz my head is killing and im freezing, so ill write about yesterday. Jackies brother was putting together a skate competition at the skate park so me and jacks decided to go. When we got their we tried to avoid her parents and pretend we didnt noe them, and it helped that we found kate cuz she kinda blocked us lol. So jacks, kate, and me were just sitting there and we decided we wanted to cross the bowl to get to the other side. Now none of us wanted to lead, so we waited for deon(idk how to spell his name) to come and lead the way. Ofcourse we cross on the side that has the least people, but it is also the steepest part. So im running down and i feel like im gonna fall, and when im running up, i had to grab onto the side cuz its rly hard to go up. When i finally get up i hear jackie(she was having trouble cuz she was wearing flip flops) go ""emma im gonna fucking kill you"" cuz i didnt bother to help her, i just followed kate. I took pictures and all the skaters were sooo good, even the little like 7 year old ones. We got to see alot of people too. Like this guy tim(came out of the bushes obviously high) and was like ""you guys having fun""(while making funny hand movements) then he goes ""no?""
so im like yeah. Then later on we saw him again, and he goes hav you seen jesus(while making funny movements implying the guy has hair liek jesus) and at that point me and jackie knew he was talking about joe, who we also call jesus lmao. The band there was rly good too, both of them. Jackie embarrassed me at one point but we dont need to talk about that right jackie? lmao anyway yesterday was awesome and it reminded me of all the cool things me and jackie used to do more of. Us rebels. l8er"

"event","I am sitting in a little cottage by the sea and I absolutely adore it here.

The kitchen is cosy and warm from the Aga stove, outside it is sunny and the garden is full of daffodils and beyond that I can see the ocean. And everything makes me think of the nicest week that I spent here in the summer two years ago.

Today was spent getting up stupidly early for a Saturday, showering and then having my overly long fringe cut (i'm still not sure I like it and may have to just go back to a blunt cut like I always used to have). 
Then it was off into town, walking along the seafront, spending Christmas vouchers on <a href=""http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/p-12706-cath-kidston-mini-strawberry-red-spot-tea-towel-set-of-2.aspx"">these</a> and <a href=""http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/p-12099-cath-kidston-mini-cowboy-kids-suitcases.aspx"">ohyaycowboys!!</a> and <a href=""http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/p-12159-cath-kidston-mini-cowboy-beaker.aspx"">this</a> in the cutest Cath Kidston shop I have ever seen, I could have easily lived there, it was like something out of Little House on the Prairie (only with gorgeous bright floral wallpaper).

Then I bought my mum some glass tea coasters for Mother's Day to go with the big serving plate I bought her at Christmas.

After this we went for lunch in a balcony top cafe, with crusty bread, olives and olive oil for dipping as a starter and then I had vegetable lasagne.
This was followed by a not so nice ice cream, taking photos of the various people walking around who looked interesting, watching the air ambulance land and wandering through an arts market which was full of little closed workshops that you could look into.
There was one which stood out, it looked like a serial killer's shed at the bottom of the garden, it was crammed with junk and mechanical parts and household tools, but dotted around were severed dolls heads, flattened dead birds and lizards and old fashioned childrens toys, it was creepy but I also loved it, I wish my camera batteries hadn't died. And there was a newspaper cutting with Zachary Quinto as Spock stuck to the wall above one of the desks.

The afternoon was ended by feeding mints to some very eager horses in a field and having slobbered on fingers."

Yesterday I was Quite Ill for the majority of the day, and looking forward to getting home and into bed.

What actually happened was that I got home, showered, put on my PJs, was happily getting ready for film-watching in bed, when the new plan for Friday Evening was 10 minutes to get dressed, makeup-ed etc and go to a friends birthday flat party.


The results of which were spending half the evening slowly sinking into a sofa whose back was deceptively far away, whilst the drunkest girl I have ever seen kept falling on me, begging me to dance and telling me I was gorgeous. When she dragged her flatmate over, (who she had been drunkenly and probably subconsciously groping all night) and made him observe my 'stunningness' I asked them if they were grooming me for a threesome, they didn't deny it, but eventually, after managing to grope me, fall in my face and play footsie with me over the legs of four different people sitting between us she went home, with cries of 'I love your fringe! Look how nice her smile is.'

The rest of the evening involved tiny little sparklers, having drinks spilt on my feet, dancing in wet patches, talking to someone who used to live in my house and her dropping into the conversation that she was the fuzz, by means of a warning I decided, a friend of Drunk Girl explaining to me in great detail that Drunk Girl was attracted to me because we had similar shaped faces and features, only that I had a bigger gob and the taxi driver on the way home giving us his personal mobile number so we could ring him and get a mix CD of the music he was playing. Ace.

Possibly the most ungirly high-pitched scream ever that managed to come from me on that ride, I think calling it a deep belly roar of horror as we dropped 160ft would probably be more accurate.

So adrenaline rushes and then going to bed at 2am after many White Russians has left me liking my bed quite a lot today, especially with a big glass of cherry coke and a tummy full of hash browns and fried eggs, whoo go healthy eating!"

"event","I'm still digesting the Who finale last night. Still not quite sure how I feel about it.


<lj-cut text=""Spoilers...""> 


Me and the boyf have been re-watching the NewWho from the start of season one with the Eccle-Stone, as I've managed to convert him into a fan.

We've been watching a few episodes a day and last night the first thing I said after Journey's End finished was, 'I can't watch any more Doctor Who tonight.'



At first I decided I hated it. It felt too neat, too final and finished. Russell T. tying up all loose ends into a nice little bow and popping them into a decorative box. Ready for Stephen Moffat to start afresh with all the new story lines he wants.

And that final scene with Rose and 10.5. Made me so angry. Rose has come all this way to find her doctor and then she gets fobbed off with a copy and sent away, never to be mentioned or angsted about again. 
And I can see how you could be happy about that ending for her, imperfect and bitter sweet as it is. And I'm trying to be happy about it, and I think eventually I will be. 
But 10 just ditches her. Doesn't look back. Is such a coward that pushes everyone away from him, and he still can't even tell her that he loves her.
And I'd like to think that it's because he knows there's no point, that she couldn't stay with him cos she'd die and he'd still be the same, and how painful that would be for both of them. 

I need to re watch it again tonight, but he just seemed so distant from the whole thing, like he'd already made his peace with losing her and so it wasn't that big a deal this time.

If I were Rose I would have so many problems with 10.5. Because you technically it's not him. He has the memories and the personality of 10, but that's all it is, he never actually <I>did</I> any of those things, they're memories of another man.
But then I suppose that's what regeneration is, 10 never did any of the things that 9 did, but he remembers them.

And I still can't decide who he was punishing when he sent Rose away with 10.5. Was he punishing himself because of what Davros said. Or was he punishing 10.5 for repeating his mistake. The genocide that made him so angry about Martha and Jack using destruction to stop the Daleks.
Because I agree with the Osta Hagen key. And the warp star. Because if there was no other choice to save the universe then at least they were ready to do what had to be done.
Whereas the Doctor is so damaged by the Time War and the people who have died during is adventures that he can't ever accept that sometimes that is the only way, and that if he hadn't changed these people, then others would have just taken there place, with or without him.



And Donna. Poor Donna. That was so terrible. I know she shouted a lot. But she'd grown on me, and I only hope that Wilf and her mother will help her. 
And the Doctor is alone again, as he thinks he deserves to be."

Didn't really expect anything to happen, but was still disappointed that it just came up as an unrecognised number.
The Beeb could have at least had an recorded answer message from Tennant or maybe the Tardis noise, or a 'this number is out of range' message. Something at least.


I wonder how many other people rang it, hoping for a 'Bruce Almighty' type cock-up, where God's pager number was actually some little old woman's real number who had to cancel it after being inundated by people wanting a good chin-wag with God."

The decking in the back garden. 
Last night it played host to all the alcohol in the house being consumed, and refusal to go inside even though we were all slightly freezing.

This morning we dragged a sofa out through the double doors of the living room onto the decking and had breakfast in the sunshine.



Conclusion. Fried egg, toast and a mug of tea on a sofa in the garden is the best cure for a hangover.
Could have used this information this time last week where I had a monstrous hangover of epic proportions."

+ Today at work some girl spread a malicious rumour that the toddler staff (myself and two other girls) 'let a child run away'. The reality being said child was at the bottom of the 2foot long ramp to the door and we were at the top waiting for her.
But not only did she fabricate that we lost a child, she then spread it round the entire nursery, so that before the manager could even confront us, the three of us had heard it from four other sources, all stories different.
So we had a nice angry rant, the manager got the real story, confronted the gossip spreader who then stomped out of work in the middle of the afternoon.
Pfft.


+ I'm obsessing quite a lot over certain songs at the moment.
Nina Simone - Sinnerman
Elliot Smith - Needle in the hay
Devendra Banhart - Insect Eyes
Fall Out Boy - Golden


I could go into a hundred other topics here, but all i'm going to say is i loved Transformers (eeeh, i have such a crush on Bumblebee), my flatmate is moving back to Finland in December so i gotta find a new flat/house/flatmates.

They had real live owls there, a lickle one, a barn owl and one with big orange eyes. There were loads of people there, i spotted two Lunas, one had a cork necklace, the other had a big lion head on and her hair was the exact same colour as Luna's in the film. She spotted the dark mark we painted onto my arm as soon as we walked in the shop and was hissing to all her friends 'look! she's got the dark mark!""

We got there at just after 11pm and finally left at 1:30am, i ended up buying a pack of harry potter playing cards, a penguin of death mug and an awesome travel book on Morocco, and could have brought more, i was coveting the Optimash Prime Mr Potato Head and the little Obi Wan Kenobi toys.
I spent a good ten minutes reading aloud from a Marquis de Sade book and mortifying my sister and flatmate who were queing with me.
They kept giving announcements on the tanoi saying 'please calm down, there are enough books for everyone'.
What i thought was really wrong was the fact that they handed out the pre-ordered copies to people in the line, who then could read it whilst waiting to get to the checkout.
And the girl behind me got hers and went straight to reading the last page. I could have been sick.
Then announced 'this is crap' and threw it at her friend.

"event","Would it be really sad of me to say i miss LJ!
No, i don't think so.
I've been in my flat now for, i don't know, two months?
We do finally have the internet, but it doesn't like to work on my laptop and so whenever i want to check something online i have to knock on my flatmates door, ask if i can use the net (even though i paid for and got it all set up) then watch her sigh and boot it all up for me, then she sits looking over my shoulder whilst i check my email and myspace.

ugh. need to get wireless.

i could type a huge entry now, but i'm not sure where to start.
so i'll just say i have a kitten, and my flat still and i have moved to another of the nurseries that i work for which is 10minutes down the road from my flat, but is very quiet and the hours drag.

Hope everyone is well and hopefully i'll be able to update properly soon.

Two made me cry. One made me laugh throughout. One made go all squishy in my tummy.

Guess which was which?


I'm off to France for 10days or so now, i probably won't get online, even though there is an internet cafe in the town i'm staying in.

You may wonder what lies are being circulated in my place of work.
Well my friends, i shall tell you, so that you can know it is untrue also.

Would have been more if i'd had my own way too.

Saw Superman Returns, which was actually a lot better than i expected. I'm actually <3ing on Superman a bit right now, ;p

Then saw Pirates of the Caribbean 2 for the second time, arrrr still loving it.
Thinking about having Barbossa, Jack, Norrington, Bootstrap and Davey Jones all at the same dinner party right now."

1. Work sucking up all of my time during the week. Including doing over forty hours overtime last month in order to try and pay off my overdraft finally.

2. Weekends being spent turning into a dreadful drunk.

I have mostly been grumbling about the heat and the freckles that have insisted on appearing all over my nose.
Playing at Indiana Jones by running to the back of the garage then clicking the automatic door to go down and seeing how long i can leave it before sliding underneath whilst my accomplices throw debris in my path to slow me down.

Also having dreams with the most beautiful miniature town that an art student had built and put in a real street. I took many photos in the dream and the first thing i did upon waking up was to check my camera, sadly, the photos weren't on there."

My throat and ears are better, but i do have this crazy stomach cramp thing going on whenever i don't eat, and just after i do.

Returning to work.
Feeling ill.
My obvious inability to engage with people on more than a basic level.


To deal with these, work has to be attended, deal with it.
Illness is being covered in pills of many sorts and an early morning visit to the doctor to be told it's only viral at the moment and antibiotics will be given in five days when my tonsils have been the death of me.
My social ineptitude warrants an apology to certain people, i hope you know who you are and i'm very sorry for not being able to live up to promises."

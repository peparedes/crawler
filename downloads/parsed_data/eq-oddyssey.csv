"event","i have been on leave since aug 14. i was sent home from work. i dont know what's gotten into me that i put off resting from an illness due to guilt? i dont know why i feel guilty for getting sick. i've been ill since the whole month of july then i got the dizzy spells.... anemia. i should have known better to have sought consultation early on, but as stubborn as i am, i have to put it off wishing it'll just go away. when it didn't, i have to rush my medical insurance to make sure that i got myself covered. stupid me. 
anyway, my doctor gave me 10 days rest. meaning no calls, no daily hospital rounds and the works. so i think i got more pale since i've been staying indoors for quite sometime now. the farthest that i reached was the gasoline station at the corner where humpy treated me to a graham teddy cinnamon cracker. hehehe....
it's hard to be ill in a froreign land. i dont know why im so afraid fo seeking consult when im surrounded with doctors all day. anyway, those unrealistic fears were put to ease after i had  my first visit to a gyne clinic then onto my internist clinic. those clinics were like a dream... can sure put a patient at ease. 
right now i need to hohummmmm theae iron tablets are making me sleepy"

"event","so this is it. this is what it feels like when you're far from everything familiar and home. 
i still can't believe how fast time flies. 
i miss manila so much. the people in my life, the faces and places, the sound, the smell, the sight. everything that is manila.
oh i just feel sooooooo homesick. i miss my parents. my siblings, my friends who make me who i am. 
i cant imagine if i would have gone this far if humpy isn't around. 
bahamas is beautiful but it would be more complete if everybody is here with me.
i hope i can fast track and go home to manila. even for just a while. but not until april... i have something to look forward to."

"event","it's been 3 months since i arrived here, yet no pics posted in my entries. i find it hard to edit the pics and i'm still settling in. 
my humpy is here with me. he arrived a month ago. a presence that decreased the amout of loneliness that i felt missing my family and friends. yes. people are more important than having a fat bank account. well we already know that is not a myth.
take the example of a celeb who just passed away recently and is buried here a couple of days ago... she had money, fame and yet we all know that life hasn't been that good to her as she perceived it. financially it has been. she has problems that she just shrugged off. according to someone who i know knows the couple, the couple are nice people but people and media are just not kind enough. they are so cruel that they camped out in front of the residence with ladder. even in death, she still wasn't given the peace that she deserves... 
maybe im just busy with work and life that i did not bother following the news or paying extra attention to it. what caught my attention is the delay in the memorial services and the last attempt to exhume the son to be taken back to the US. huwaaattttt? even the funeral almost became a circus. i dont want to die like that."

"event","it's been a while lj, i have been to far away place in the philippines and now im off somewhere in the world. i have had beautiful music playing for me for the past year that i irregularly update you. i can't tell if i lived my life in the fast lane that i really don't have much time on my hands then. 
i am here. going over what happened last 2005 i knew the answers. why i wasn't able to leave when i was supposed to or almost about to. now i'm finally here. it's been more than 2 weeks since i left manila. i'm still adjusting here. i left 2 weeks after i had surgery. see... i need to have that done there before leaving...have been putting off consultation since i first had the nosebleed way back august. but it's all done now. the scare was terrible. i'm practically A ok. 
then there was the poea bruhaha... imagine me going to poea in slow mo...like 39 hours post op (GA at that) and then the british airways fiasco... (yoki lounging at the HK int'l airport) hahaha.. i traveled for 24 hours wih 3 plane transfers in 2 huge airports. i can proudly say i survived it all. my life is indeed colorful. 
a week before i left, humpy left too. now we're really miles away from each other. thanks to technology, i still get to see him. i can't wait to have him here soon.
if i have any regrets leaving... hmmmm it was not being able to see or at least talk to some important people before i left...i left hurriedly. i know they will understand.  but vacation is just around the corner... ooopss which reminds me that i need to get my leave schedule for 2007 in on monday! ha!"

"event","i was supposed to back to manila as scheduled yesterday by regular trip of the company's private aviation, then the regular flight got cancelled during the last minute. hey... i badly need to go home.. this is the shortest stay i had in the island 28 days... and i want to go back to manila... not only due to superman hahaha.... i spent the entire evening of june 29 trying to catch the last minute booking for a commercial flight. our small plane cessna 402 will fly us to mindoro then i will have to take chance with asian spirit... just to go home. good news is: I MADE IT! im here, sleepless and all. i arrived 8:20 am june 30.
i'm just staying at home for now. resting and clearing my mind. it's humpy's birthday tomorrow... the prime reason why i am dying to go home just in time for humpy's birthday. 
On another note: i am going gaga over this game for the last 24 hours: vampires vs. warewolves.... it's really kinda old news in manila but... what the heck i love this one:

<LI> oh we all know that i lost my job may 2005 without prior notice that raised the hell within</LI>
<LI> i was suppossed to go to the Bahamas, then i got bumped off by a cuban national</LI>
<LI> i accepted the job at Korean Friendship Hospital and it was a-ok </LI>
<LI> then i went for a temporary LOA and accepted the offer from Semirara Antique and i just wish to try it for a month, that became 6 weeks that furthered into 8 weeks</>
<LI> before i left manila, i registered as a medical practitioner in Queensland </LI>
<LI> as fate played it's game, i met my humpy in semirara </LI>
</OL>
Semirara is a beautiful place. the perfect peace im looking for. my life took a quiet turn but not that laid back. we are provided with amenities- furnished with free cable TV 2 flr 2 br with bath apt unit, full course meals, endless coffee, drinking water, free electricity that you can leave your aircon day in and day out (oh do this in manila and your bill will be enuf to drive you nuts), there's a tennis court, a badminton court, a gym- without an instructor though. it'll be your choice if you are going to spend. laundry service is a hundred bucks for 1 week. life is simple and stress free. no gasoline prices to worry about. but for mall rats and those who love shopping and movies in wide screen, this is not the place to be. we watched wide screen though, using our laptops and lcd's and our very own living room wall. 
i was initially accommodated in unit number 39. my eyes widened when i saw the unit. i was looking for a tv when i first arrived there and they provided me with a 21 inch jvc flat tv. o d ba ang babaw... last month before i left for a vacation, i transferred to my newly renovated unit. the wifi is already up so perhaps when i come back there i'll be in lj land once more.
i see patients day in and day out 24 hrs a day on call with out-patients during office hours but i'm paid 24/7. the people are nice. and for some of them, humpy and i are the first doctors to have seen them in their entire life.

All my life, without a doubt I give you
All my life, now and forever till the
Day I die, you and I will share

All the things this changing world can offer
So I sing, I'd be happy just to
Stay this way, spend each day, with you

There was a time, that I just thought
That I would lose my mind
You came along and then the sun did shine
We started on our way
I do recall that every moment spent
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line

I put the past away
I put the past away
I put the past away

All my life, I will carry you through
All my life, between each hour of the passing days
I will stay with you

Hold me now
Stop the morning light from breaking
Something's coming over me
Don't know what it is sub-saving
The clocks expire
They just might change everything
If I don't give you all that's waiting
Who knows what tomorrow will bring
If I try not to need you I'll be hiding from myself but all

If tomorrow never comes
I would do it all again
If the light never breaks through
I would stay until the end
If I saved it all for you
I would have my faith again
Then, then I would know it's you

Won't shed a tear for more than just a moment
Try not to let myself go crazy
Tomorrow may not come
So I won't
Hold you here
Unless you wanna fight about it
I would gladly let you win
Cause I don't need to write this ending
If I just trust the stillness
Somehow it won't hurt so bad
Oh

If tomorrow never comes
I would do it all again
If the light never breaks through
I would stay until the end
If I saved it all for you
I would have my faith again
Then, then I would know

You are dignified, spiritual, and wise.
Always unsatisfied, you constantly try to better yourself.
You are also a seeker of knowledge and often buried in books.

You tend to be philosophical, looking for the big picture in life.
You dream of inner peace for yourself, your friends, and the world.

"event","due to insomnia and nausea over the current events. i want to rant.
i used to be indifferent in political affairs. i just do my job as a law abiding citizen because i feel that is my own small way. i love my country and its inhabitants in my own small way. i may have dream of seeking greener pastures overseas but that does not mean i am turning my back on my roots even if i am only 75% native, my dad is half american. when i was in HS i used to hear my mom say that it doesn't matter who is at the seat of power. what matters is the heart of the one seating in power. look at where it led us so far. everyone who wants to seat himself have their own horrific tales to date and so my homeland is going to the dogs...
i can't change the world. i can only make small postive changes in myself hoping to at least unburden my country. simple things like following traffic rules, not spitting on the streets, crossing the pedestrian lane, not littering and being transparent in my transactions are but a few but imagine the impact if one can inspire another to do the same, i guess there is still hope for this country. tang ina tama na ang dada.. lahat gustong umupo kasi lahat gustong mangurakot, if not why are there incidence of violence during baranggay elections? is SK elections worth dying for, considering the amount of stipend you are to receive from the government? corruption is not only measured in terms of gold. korea is also a corrupt country, but the koreans love their nation so much that they did their share in their own small way and never failed to pray for their country.. look at where they are now. we may live in a banana republic, with a bogus president, who by her public apology silently shouted at the nation: hey I can't be trusted! now we are the laughing stock of the world. look at us: alila na ng mundo, where teachers and engineers go abroad to work as domestic helpers with the exception of a few (feeling pushed against the wall) and where doctors become nurses... tsk tsk... this is the sad fate of my nation, sad but true, where most of my country men care more about the I. I want this. I want that. <i>puro pakabig, parang laging nagmamahjong</i>.  I pity the countless men and women who died for this country, and i guess they are quite ready to bolt out of their graves. what we really need is a change of heart... a change within, even before attempting to change thy husband, wife, brother, sister family, friends, neighbors and countrymen, take a closer look at the man in the mirror."

"event","last night was one of my darkest moments. but it was not new to me anymore. i can't remember the countless times i fell prey to the dark creatures who disguised themselves as humans. my job item got snatched at the last minute when i was almost due to ship my belongings (err food items). of course i cried buckets and buckets of tears. i was informed thru ym chat that a cuban doctor teacher, not even a pediatrician (here they go again), who happens to be a wife of a bahamian national, took my slot. the switch happened so fast that the doctors who were in charge of transporting and accommodating me there got shocked. well that's life it's not our territory. now i have to wait until november. i can only feel the hurt because this is not the first time. memories came flooding in...years ago in one of the hospitals in manila while i was applying for residency in the dept of obstetrics and gynecology, i ranked number two. when they called for pre residents (8 in number) my slot got snagged by another doctor, who i never saw during the exams nor during the interview. i can't miss her because i know her and we are chika. the reason was plain and simple: among us applicants, i was the only one without a backer who moved her finger because she found out i topped the exams. she was confident that i will not be dislodged from the ranks even if they get 3. that was a sure slot. see, they called for 8, i wasn't there. because of this i gave up my dream of becoming an obstetrician and applying in manila. those were tough times when doctors are still doctors and not sporting nurse's caps. the incident paved the way for what i was planned to be: a pediatrician. come to think of it, i am aware i'm better off being in pediatrics because i just take it with a grain of salt. in ob, i have a hard time doing hand tying skills. haha... it was meant to be. 
i will not seek the answers for what happened for i know they will come in due time when all is set and i will finally be able to put all the pieces of my puzzle together. this won't stop me. i will just have to wait a few more months because the cuban can't wait.

just this morning i called to confirm our slot in an office in makati to work temporarily as a medical evaluator, because we are due to report tomorrow... would it be surprising to know that it got snagged last friday... well at least there was one slot and i gave it to someone special who needs it more than i do...

but it seems i didn't get enough beating...
as i was traversing diosdado macapagal avenue on the way to help my dad who will be doing <i>lipat-bahay</i> for my nurse friend, cielo, (that's another story: she was almost hog-tied massacared last thursday)... a huge billboard fell in front of me, missing my car by the hair. 
yes, BILLBOARD! it was the billboard of Hobbies of Asia, with the chicken wire fence falling with it. and of all cars... my car and with me driving. what are the chances of having a billboard crashing down on you... imagine the horror in front of me,seeing the huge crashing billboard. i thought it fell on my windshield. i swerved to the left but my front tire ran over the steel supports causing my right front tire to burst and on close inspection, even my mag wheels got pierced to the center.... how lucky can i get. i'm just too tired to write.

Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)

No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
We head back to hell again
We kiss and we make up on the way

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel just like walking away
But as our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, 
maybe you'll return
Maybe you'll never find
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
You never know baby youuuu and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy)
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow"

"event","dear lj,
it's really been a while. i guess i have not that much to write about so i just end up reading entries. since i rid myself with job loads, i am now the official laundry woman at home. so what's there to write about--- <OL>
<LI> which detergent produces more bubbles?- tide nature fresh or surf? </LI>
<LI> if one tries to remove clothes from the spin dryer while spinning, will you end up singing 9 little indians instead of 10? </LI>
<LI> what is static? </LI>
<LI> why do clothes produce electric current that i nearly had electrical burns while removing them from water? </LI></OL>

anyway, i'm just waiting and for now i arrange my things to be shipped ahead of me....(read: relief goods in preparation for world war)

"event","i dreamt of you last night and i woke up crying. i guess i just miss you a lot and was just trying to keep my mind off things. as in everything. most of the time im in front of the pc playing ragnarok, day in day out for the last 6 days. it's been like 10 months since i last saw you. never bother writing letters to you anymore because i don't know what to say to a person who i miss so much. and besides, what else am i gonna do, rant and ramble? that's what my life is like right now so i suddenly clam up, lick my wounds until i'm ready to face the world again, stronger than ever, ready to let hell break loose. i am also waiting for the time to wish well the people who did me wrong and hurt me so much. i don't talk to people around me that much anymore, they too have their problems and battles. i am living a secluded life at home, with my pc, with my ragnarok--- this is what i do catharsis and waste of ceiling high electricity costs..."

"event","wow! it's june. a couple of weeks ago, i got a ragnarok installer cd from one of the sponsors of pepot. because i got so bored, i decided to give it a try... now i'm addicted to playing it... second childhood? the game became my outlet. it made me avoid ranting on my lj temporarily regarding the recent incident from where i work. i want to channel all the negative energies the people ""who i thought were my friends"" gave me. 
yep. i finally got the letter. i got the formal letter last sunday. save them from hell breaking loose. but the date of the letter says it all. of course i sent a very sarcastic text message to the unethical people... something that goes---""mabuti naman at hindi nyo pinangatawanang bastos kayo.... blah, blah, blah"" 
come to think of it. these people don't even deserve me at all. i will not tell them to talk to the hand because they don't even deserve the finger. i just have to let it all out. how can one even continue to work with all the back stabbers who are professionals at that? the good thing is--- it didn't make me lesser of a person. 
i will just play ragnarok and eventually, my rage will lessen until i will have to wish them well. for now i shut up and hope this school year will bring hell to those who deserve it. read: talk about wishing them well, im still enraged.
a general question: what does an ENT specialist (oops non board certified) have to do with school health eh? surrounded with new pediatricians (board certified) at that who will eventually be at her mercy... plastic! 
and to the evp--- i just hope you can sleep tight knowing that more than a dozen families will be having a hard time fending for themselves because you decided to change the agency that covers the maintainance, now a lot of people have no jobs, at this time of economic crisis. it could have been the perfect time to apply your mission-vision of religio, mores and cultura. ""the evil that men does are oft intered in their bones...""
now i'm glad i'm out of there... i hope it won't be what <lj user=audiofeel> calls ""same circus different tent.""
according to <lj user=audiofeel> ""kahit saan may demonyo...""

ngayon: kaninong values ang nasa paa???"

I have a real journal now. It's pretty. It has a ribbon. 
It's more personal, less exhibitionist.
Although I'll keep this for awhile...maybe just to tell you of my new discoveries.

Like this latest breed of teenagers:

The uber-fashionable. They look silly. There are so many wandering around here. Big sunglasses, excessive accessories, experimental colors. Basically, if they look like they're trying to fit into a magazine spread (or online catalog, what have you) but they're too over done. Hence...UBER-fashionable. Spot them. Giggle at them. Feel sorry for their polka dots, layers of off the shoulder sweaters, plastic jewelery and use of pink and black combinations."

<lj-cut>

Oh yeah, so I never wrote about <b><u>graduation</b></u>...well...

It was ... boring. The practice ceremony, that is. The second part was just pretty much like 8th grade graduation except we had to listen to a bunch of speeches. I guess that would have been a little more enjoyable had I not spent the last month (or so) analyzing and critiquing graduation speeches in public speaking. <i>By the way, I think Alexis' speech from the year my brother graduated was one of the best that I've ever read.</i> 

Anyway, after graduation was fun. I didn't go to project graduation because my cousins were coming up from PA and of course, Ricky was here. I got home to a very angry phone call from Amanda for my running out early but I'm sorry, I just felt that I should soak up the time I have left with them. My cousins are moving out to Las Vegas ... well, they already did as of the 29th. I told her that I was going to duck out soon anyway since she wanted a picture of the two of us together but she kept running off screaming at other people so oh well. 

We went to Charlie Brown's afterwords. We being my father, brother, Ricky, Frankie, (cousin) Nicole, (cousin's daughter) Daylene, Uncle Stephen, Auntilique, and (cousin) Christina. There were 4 other graduates from TZ having dinner there during our time eating, Frankie said he saw 5 but I can't think of the 5th one. Aaron (Ruuuuufioooooo), Emily Feller, Billy Valentine, and apparently one more I can't remember but I counted 4.

It was fun. We stayed until after they closed because my family is just extremely slow with everything they do. The staff there were trying to give us hints to get lost but it didn't really work. But yeah, it was fun. Even though I was horribly embarrassed by my father's genius idea to get them to bring out a cake and sing to me. ""Happy Graduation"" to the tune of ""Happy Birthday"", is it possible to go wrong there? Oh yes! Of course they had to make it unbelievably obnoxious and loud with squawks and such. I wanted to bury my face in the cake but I think that would have made it worse. 

Now I guess I should talk about my loot! Well, I don't have one. I got 50 dollars from my god-parents and a Bouquet of lollipops from Nicky. YEAH I GOT A BOUQUET OF LOLLIPOPS!! So I kick all of your flower-loving-butts. Hehe, it doesn't matter that I didn't get materials because... I had <b>Ricky</b> and my <b>Cousins</b> [sans Stevie and Daniella]! They make me an extremely happy camper. I'd rather not get a lot. I've been too spoiled over hmm...my entire life? So it works out. Yeah, that sounds cheesy/corny/otherfoody but it's true. 

I'm going to miss my cousins a lot but it's the sad truth that I'll probably see them more when they live out in Las Vegas than I have when they lived in PA. However, it would have just been a lot easier for everyone if they never moved out of NY. Oh well, I'll just look forward to the possibility of seeing them for Thanksgiving. I think that's what is being planned.</lj-cut> 

<b><u>Ricky Tangent</b></u>
<lj-cut>
I miss Ricky a lot more than I thought I would. I was half praying that he'd miss his flight and have to come back here. He did miss his flight, but it only bought him 4 hours of wandering the airport by himself. My dad didn't want to drive back to pick him up because it was a waste of time. Ricky didn't say he wanted to be picked up either so I guess it worked out. Yeah, I just generally thought I'd handle his departure better than moping around the house and taking several naps just so I could pass the time. I'm not the only one though, Kenji misses him a lot too. I woke up yesterday morning to him wandering around in circles where Ricky slept for the past week crying. Then later, I was wearing Ricky's rabid shirt and I took it off so I could go out, when I got back, Kenji was sleeping on it. It's cute, but he wouldn't shut up. I made Ricky call me and talk to the silly cat just to get him to calm down or something. It pretty much only worked while I was on the phone. Sooner or later he got tired and shut up. He's sitting on the floor next to me. 

I think I corrupted the poor boy. The longer he was here, the lazier he got. <i>If you didn't know, my family is extremely lazy, as am I.</i> By the middle of his week here, he had a pile of his dirty laundry behind the door to the bathroom in my TV room. It was funny but he's much lazier now than he was before. He even left his clothes on the floor when he took a shower one morning! Before this past week, he would clean up after everything within seconds, so yeah. I am a bad influence. 

This trip was definitely better than his first. Unfortunately, that meant that I had a much harder time giving him up. I fell asleep on the couch beside where he slept and I woke up after my brother had been sitting there for awhile under Ricky's blanket and I expected to see Ricky so much that I starred at my brother like he had three heads. It was just weird. I can't really describe it. It felt like he was here forever. Well, he kind of was. But still, it is just odd not having him around. Kind of sucks. Really badly. Definitely sucks. I'll get over it though, so will he. It's already in the works that I'm going out with him to England for Christmas this year. It's really exciting. I just need to get a job and save up because I do not want him paying for me to go out there. It's about 600 dollars a ticket. I have a pretty good base for having my money add up but I'm going to try to work it out with my dad that he'll get me a passport (because he wanted me to get one anyway) and maybe pay for 1/2 or 1/4 of the ticket as my Christmas present. That way I can have enough to get Ricky's dad, step-mother, and Lee Christmas gifts and have a little more spending money. That's six months away though. Bleh. I also have to do that whole college thing in between. Double bleh. I guess I'll write more about this later...when I have more details.

I just want to see him again.
</lj-cut>

I think I'm done now, that's the most I've written in an online journal since Xanga. I have to brush my teeth.

Where you will sit and contemplate your day

I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning
In an open tab when your judgement's on the brink
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
Albums back as you're lying there drifting off to sleep...
I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you...
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes
I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zippedstraight to the throat
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold

I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
And kiss you on the mouth
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene,
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change,
We'll give ourselves new names (identities erased)
The sun will heat the grounds
Under our bare feet in this brand new colony
Everything will change

Sooo...

School's Over, what have I learned? I think I'll make a list sooner or later but right now the only thing I can think of wasn't school related at all.

<i>Don't try to put out a fire with beer.</i>

It's pretty much common sense but when a person is drunk off of 7.5 beers, they might propose this as a solution and that's when you should step in and say <b>NO</b>.

Anyway, I am disgusting. My clothes are all super-humidi-fied so they're chalky feeling. That coupled with the fact that my skin is like wet chicken skin if I wake up hot isn't the most glamourous feeling in the world.

I still have three disposable cameras to get developed and I'm going to pick up pictures from Debbie later today. Hopefully I'll get a few good pictures out of that...27 x 4. Oh, and Amanda/Justin still have to give me the CD of pictures she took on her digital.

I actually went through the yearbook and read quotes of the senior class, I like how there is one about being unique that's duplicated a few times. It makes me smirk.

Bleh. I need money to do this whole Graduation/Birthday/Ricky thing. So I am now accepting donations. Your patronage is appreciated.

So that's that

Poor things though, a few have broken necks. :\

Anyway...

Today I planted a rose bush and cleaned up all the weeds.
In the next few weeks I'm going to plant another rose bush, a few different types of grasses, tulips, and other flowers I don't know the names of. Hopefully I can get some nice daisies.
I also want to find a Butterfly Bush but I don't know how much those go for. If it's too expensive then I'll just wait until I get my own house to set up that kind of garden.

Eee. I'm excited.

I also got myself a new pet.
A venus fly trap named Seymour.
I can't plant him though. At least not yet. He needs a lot of warm humidity and damp soil."

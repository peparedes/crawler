Hung out with tom, had leroy there and andrew (ex drag queen, simply fabulous) anyway, andrew decided it was pathetic that tom try to crawl all over me when it was obvious I didnt want it. so he said something, tom got pissed, rul pissed all weekend and flipped out over everything, and actually almost abandoned me and andrew in vancouver,..I woulda killed things.


anyway after an entire weeknd me and leroy come home, and his mother is drunk,..and what else? yes thats right kiddies as alot of drunk people really angry, for NO reason. basically I left and she had a ""talk with leroy"" which meant yelled at him. and guess what she did? she hypocrited all over herself.

before she loved tom, but last night he was a ""stupid faggot"", and leroy wasnt allowed to hang out with faggots. When leroy said she shouldnt use that word before he'd get actually offended. She said if he gave her lip I'd be out on my ass.

Now ok w/e she can be a bitch all she wants, but then she had the fucking nerve of accusing us of having poermiscuous gay sex.

Now when I spend my entire life as I have, admantly against BAD kid things, then get blammed ONCE again for shit I dont do,..it pisses me off.

so this morning, when I was still very pissed, maria felt it and asked leroy...then informed him that she ""didnt know faggot was offencive"" though she was yelling it angrily and usually uses gay. And that if I wanted to have attitude I didnt have to live here.


Basically yes everyone I am seriously contemplating moving to montana, or just somewhere in canada to get away~


so i love you all. but I swear to fucking god and vow, if any of you ever get drunk anywhere within striking distance I'm going to break your nose. 

I am really sick of drunk assholes ruining my living situation,..thats three times now."

I think it might be healthy for me, I have felt like I was going to just explode on anyone today and start screaming and crying. I didnt' cause I got a bit of controll.

I know WHY I would have this breakdown,..and then I feels tupid for feeling that way,..which contributes. you know, being cynical at everything, even at your own thoughts is bad times.

Work didn't help, ir eally hate having to cancel plans with people. I've had to cancel on kaya twice now it's really fucking pissing me off.

Which adds to my needs for a breakdown. I really dont have good enough reasons for one, but I can't exactly help it either. and I also dont like that I feel the need to explain myself over my LJ so people dont look down on me for having one. Which in itself is sad...and I shouldnt care about such trivial things.

SO yes to help you all understand, and dont hate me for my feelings. I will List out what is causing my breakdown...or might be.

1. Want to be with Damien. 
2. Knowing I can't be with Damien. Cause he's over me and I wouldn't allow it.
3. Not being able to properly express myself period.
4. Not being able to unload my emotions on anyone.
5. The feeling that kaya hates me cause of Tom.
6. All gay men being nothing but complete sluts.
7. Putting leroy in akward places (I dont like doing that)
8. Only being attractive to small mexican flammers and pervy old guys.
9. Missing chances with the few good ones {i.e. Jimmeh)
10. Choosing the bad ones (cheated on before it even started)
11. Work, waaaaay to much stress for such a no brainer job.
12. Collage, I dont wanna be a bum.
13. My fear of driving.
14. Allergies.
15. Rain or heat.


Theres more,a nd no those arent in order of importance,..i really dislike myself right now. I dunno this isnt a rant,..more of a umm,..expression of thoughts that I am to afraid to say outloud. or I might cry like a little girl.


on another note,..someone killed a rabbit witha  bat and hat it in thier truck bed....wierd."

I called today,..and now I have nothing in my savings, but a fuckload in my checking,..they moved it all around and ima rape me some babies soon.

Secondly. it really dosnt bug me that much <.<

thirdly. My wprk is about to become a swirling pit of suck. everyone cool is leaving and all the uncool buttcheeks are replacing them.

next. I am getting tired of this whole being a teenage fag who wants a meaningfull relationship...I'm the only one it seems so it wont work. I am thusly not cool enough for dating and instead befriend through like 3 people the entire northwest gay community,..and they allllll know eachother... <.< it's wierd. really.


Portland,..btw has some really cool fucking malls, like all the art and the fact it's like a 4 story tower that then goes under the streets made me about cream myself.

then a drag queen,..or a chick with a really manly voice,..who skate boarded..o.O hit on me. <.<

that was wierd.

This all happened while tom was trying to get himself laid by random street boys whom he knew,.leroy and I went and talked with jeremy. much better times.

I know toms gonna read this and flip apeshit on me.

XD

I like my shirt,..it has a line near the top and says ""you must be this tall to ride""...most people arent.. <.< MWAHAHAHAHA.

OH kaya, I saw TOM from the RHPS, the secuirty guy,..yeah he was in the mall. stalker tom was all ""omfg look at that guy what a freak"" I punched him in the arm and told him ""shut up beaner he shares your name and is generally a better person then you."""

~Oh I see your scars I know where they're from
So sensually carved and bleeding until you're dead and gone
I've seen it all before beauty and splendour torn
It's when heaven turns to black and hell to white
Right so wrong and wrong so right

Now

Feel it turning your heart into stone
Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now - redemption
No one's gonna catch you when you fall

Oh I see you crawl you can barely walk
With arms wide open you keep on begging for more
I've been there before knocking on the same door
It's when hate turns to love and love to hate
Faith to doubt and doubt to faith

Now

Feel it turning your heart into stone
Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now - redemption
No one's gonna catch you when you fall

WHAT the fuck is wrong with me? I've known people to die and cause me less grief then a relationship.

I feel quite good right now, but still mad at myself.  Months of grief, for what? nothing returned. God damnit i feel stupid.

I hope this emotion lasts...No, this emotion WILL, last, fucking a, how could I let something as useless and trivial as love ruin my logic. Pffeght, love. Cute emotion, can cause happieness, but how useless it is, I can have happieness, with the friends I have. They, as I have been shown this night, are about 12 billion times, more supportive, careing, intellegent, and all around tollerable.

it isn't who I dated, it's what I become when I do that gets me. No more of that. 

well ok I lied, it's got alot to do with the ones I date.

drunken stupors, infadelity, dishonesty, drugs, ect ect.

"event","SO I got lots to say, but am currently in to angstya  mood to say it. I dunno, nobodies caught onto it yet. so I suppose it's all ok. Fuck, I dun feel like I belong anymore. I have no old home now, because I've moved all my shit out, and the new home just dosn't feel like home. So i have this wandering scense of I don't belong and I really don't like it. I need to geta  job, but for some reason I amw aiting, like, I dunno why but I just feel I should.

Fucking hate this angst thing. Damien, i love you, but god damnit I have begun twisting that into hate, I wish I knew how to fix myself, maybe a brick to the face. It's nobodies fault but my own, which makes the blame easier to place I guess. 

anyway, people say I should be a lawyer, or a model, but I wanna teach art.

Mayhaps a law-knowing art teacher who models for students, but not nude, as that would be illegal I'm sure. Probably creepy too. 

bleh, so much to say but no will to say it."

"event","I hate...

How good I have it, and how bad I see it.

I am a great person, I have looks, personality, charm, a fantastic mind (when I use it) wit, a sharp tongue (as in insults, not wit)I have a future, if I bother to,..try. I can literally, as anyone can, do anything, if I want.

and yet, here I sit, brooding in anger and hate, spitefull bitter nothingness. All because of one person. The worst part? I have no reason for these feelings. They are just so much easier then angst. I really really hate angst, I hate the pity you get from it, all the care that it brings out. Which seems so fake. I mean, I know it probably isn't and people have a genuine concern for my well being. however, I just dun feel it. I've gone and angstd myself into, numbness towords others. Yet, random strangers still greatly enjoy my company. I see some everyday for about 2 minutes, but they genuinly notice things. 

When I got my hair cut, it was like someone elected a new president, everyone was talking about it, they all noticed. They can tell when I am sad, and I them. but, none of it matters, because inside all I wanna do is reach through this screen and punch Damien in the face. Unjustifiably, of course I have no reason for this, it is immature and I dislike it. I cannot help it, and, beyond an annoyance (such as are most things) I could care less.

I know, it is a phase, ""time will heal it"" however time is not fast enough, and maybe just maybe, I do not want my feelings to be healed away. I liked being in love with him. I enjoyed his company. I enjoyed him, I dun understand the reasons behidn being dumped, but I accept that there were reasons. I dunno, left over emotions. Now then, anyone who has actually read that far, I applaud you on your patience. I wish I was able to psycho-analyze myself as I do everyone else. my abilities however, do not extend thatf ar inwards. I cannot subject myself to cold logic, when I know there are warm feelings ones I cannot kill, fortunatly. So yes, Damien if you read this, which I somehow doubt, I am sorry I cannot kill off my insides like you, and that I make you'relife difficult cause I cling to the tinyest notion of happieness. I Dislike being so weak, really I do. so I beg of you all, to forgive me for my little pussy moments. Oh, and of course, attacking my own self image, is great for me too. :P


so in closing I would like to remind you all, I hate fred, hatehatehatehate hate. I'malso tired. Oh and I'm moving next weekend, and that means no net for like a month. somehow, I just feel I will be able to live."

"event","So, been avoiding the internet like the plague, in case ye all hadn't noticed. Filling my life with work hours, unfortunatly there is a limit of 40 a week. Then of course bitching to myself and everyone else that I work to much. I'm fun like that.

Anger, luckily, is easier then pain. So I've gone back to it. Reversion, too is way easier then aught to be allowed. Alas, I am human, and that is hoow life shall be.


I'm tired, and Ima go shower. cause I havn't done it for days. Avoiding the home has it's consequences.

From work, to zacks, to leroys, to the new house, to work, back to zacks, thena  day with leroy and kaya, then work, then more movies with leroy, and finally home.

That was my weekend. I do miss my Own bed,the bed I share with nobody. Ever. I kick, afterall, as a testament to MY space.

So yeah, showering.

erm, bye?"

How can anyone be allowed to own a place, especially one as simple as a gas station, and not know how to run it?

Seriously.

My register, last night, was $98 short. Because of Fred. I jump to that conclusion, because circumstancial evidence shows, whenever that man touches anything with numbers, it, implodes. 


but I have no work today, so, life is good. I wanna go workout, but dad mentioned something about doing something, so instead I wait.

How are you all?"

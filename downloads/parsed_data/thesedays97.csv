"event","When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head
When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone"

"event","school is coming soon. it hasnt even hit me yet that we have to go back. sleeping in until whenever i want is just great. im staying at my dads this weekend and he is going ot be gone all day. why am i even stayin at his house? o well we are going to church together tomorrow.

my church is going crazy right now. we are trying to find a new pastor and when we think we have one someone has to screw it up. my mom is on teh pastor nominating commity and the paster we asked to be is coming this sunday to preach to us... well someone else on the commity found out that our ""to be"" pastor is apart of this group that believes everyone should be equal and work together and all that stuff.. and she also supposts gays. to me i have no problem with that. no problem at all. she is a living person to. just because she is a pastor doesnt mean she has to not believe in that. 

a bunch of older people in the church dont like it so we dont know if she is going ot be our pastor anymore.. this sunday is going to be hell because we are voting about it.. its just stupid.. but i know where my vote is going.. i just hope we have more youth parents that come to vote."

"event","Oh how times change! Since I have been back in Tucson, I have run into numerous people I knew from ""way back when"" and everyone is moving quickly and diligently on with their lives; taking the steps, whatever they may be. Everyone is having kids, getting married or both; whereas I'm just trying to keep one foot in front of the other. 

I'm still in a relationship, but I'm sure if it will last (no happily ever after) and I have convinced myself to stop thinking about marriage all together. I figure I'll be Auntie Em for most (if not all) of my life, a bride's maid and wedding planner. I don't see my wedding in any near future that I know of. Its sad to stop yourself from hoping for the improbable, but I guess its part of growing up and realizing what is and isn't versus what could be."

"event","Oregon is interesting, but there really isn't anything special about it besides the massive amount of fog, rain and mud. I've been told that this is the worst time to visit this state - fall or winter. However, I am not visiting to see the sights or go to the ocean. I am here because I need closure to certain life-changing events that have affected my life more than I ever wanted. Today I met Brenda, my Dad's girlfriend. This is the woman who should have never barged her way into my life or taken my Dad away. I have to say, after meeting her, whats so damn special. I asked my Dad what was so interesting about her and he couldn't give me any real reasons. I was slightly frustrated and you could cut the tension with a knife, but I lived through it. My mission on this trip is to get some R&R, good food/drink, see some sights and figure out what the heck is so special about Brenda- so far, I'm not impressed. She and her larger family have a very nice, 2/3 story house in the suburbs and the area really reminds me of Maryland (where the houses are backed up into the forest). Her son is 18, Tyler, nothing to say. He is s typical boy with a shaved head who looks like all of his friends and will probably live under his mother's roof for the rest of his life. Tyler lives in the basement/apartment below the house. The house is nice, but nothing special. The only thing that really got my attention today was when Dad and I went to pick up Baron from Doggie Daycare. Baron is Dad's dog and he looks just like Trapper, my german shephard from childhood (pic included). 

Dad lives in the suburbs, the normal domesticated part of Oregon; whereas Kris and Ashley live on the ""dark side"". They live in an area that reminds me of a bohemian world. Where the weirdos are everywhere and if you're not crazy...you probably won't fit in. I met some really neat people over there, great fashion statements too. They had great stories and are very traveled. I also met a nice girl and her husband who are living in Portland, but her family is mostly in Tempe (AZ) and Hawaii. I plan on hanging out with them more during the week. Dave and I had a fun first day here. He spent alot of his time playing bass in Kris's basement/studio for most of the day; when they weren't making films with a chocolate nutcracker (different story for a different day). I spent most of the time, hanging out on the couch with the three dogs and Kris's roomies; watching chick-flicks. Last night (New Years), Dave, Kris and I made ourselves a few drinks while hanging out at home. I had my lynchburgs and the boys had whiskey and water (yuck). After we were all slightly toasted, we walked to a few bars. The first bar was called the Triple Nickel; where we hung out, drank beer, played pool, made new friends and watched the ball drop. After we got tired of hanging out there, we walked about 5 blocks south to a bar Kris used to work at, called 9 Muses. This place was a bar and venue, GREAT MUSIC! We hung out with some of Kris's friends who lived below the Muse (Ms.Billy and Jason). We talked about travel, time, horoscopes, plants, and all sorts of other fun subjects (some I don't even remember). 

Towards  2 or 3 am, we started walking back to the house. I surprisingly knew (somewhat) where I was going. I almost missed Kris's street thought, thankfully the boys set me straight so I didn't get lost. The rest of the night consisted of cuddling on the futon and crashing with Dave and a bug white down-comforter. This morning was a nice hangover that was quickly cured by LOTS of water! Then later in the day, Kris made his cranberry muffins (same thing he always made in Flagstaff) and then a real breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash browns) - it was lovely hospitality!!

So far, so good....we'll see how the rest of the week goes. I'm currently in my hotel which IRONICALLY is called Phoenix Inn Suites - in oregon...weird. I am hoping to do some fun touristy stuff with Dad, but we'll see how it goes..."

"event","2007 had some really difficult obstacles, but it also had some really good times. I hope everyone had a great holiday season! I am definitely looking forward to the future. I am excited to see what new things cross my path and what new opportunities will appear. At this point, there are multiple possibilities and the changes this year will be amazing. Every year is a shedding of the old year (duh), but this year, I feel like I'm really leaving behind alot of experiences, friends, and feelings. I am going to work really hard to cleanse my soul because I feel like I am being weighed down by so much and its mostly in my heart and my head. I know I have grudges to release and people to forgive; including myself. There are things that I have done that I'm not proud of and there are people I have hurt whom I deeply still care for and about. I would like to start anew, but this process will take a while so I have to remind myself to be patient and not lose track of what I'm striving for. I would like to gain an entirely new insight in the world and a more positive perspective on things. I would like to work on my outlook, my judgemental-ness, and my entire attitude towards almost everything. This last year I lost most of my confidence of who I am, what I am capable of and the things and people I love. I want to try to ""find myself"" so to speak, because I just don't feel like myself and I'm sure anyone who reads this...has probably felt this way at least once in their life. 

I'm ready to make some changes and really attempt to organize my life. I have alot of things that I plan on doing, but without a clean workspace, I'll lose every step - time to clean up my world.

good luck to everyone in the new year !!"

"event","This is an old entry...but the draft saved itself....surprisingly...

Today is just one of those days where I am just so pissed off at the world. I am working with people who are getting all the opportunities a person could ask for and they don't do shit. They make more than I do just off of social security checks alone and I really think most of them should be put in jail or locked in a mental facility. I can't stand the fact that so many people are giving them everything they could ask for and they just continue their cycle of causing problems in society. However, those of us who worked our way through school and busted our asses to get to where we are now, make less money than the bum on the street-whats the point of all our effort?  I can honestly I'm glad I am self-sufficient and that the daily chalenges make me learn and grow. But sometimes I wish I could have the kind of help that one might need every now and then.

I am in a shitty mood in the fact that I feel my purpose on my planet shrinks more and more everyday. The people I share my life with rarely give a damn after a few short years, but I'm the sap that hangs onto those classic memories. I don't know what it is, why can't I just let go and stop caring about the trivial things in life. My family always reminds me that ""true friends are few and far between,"" and everyday, I hope that the world cares more than that...am i just that niAIVE. Why do I keep hoping that there really is some good in this world. I get so happy to see any sign of altruism, but deep down, there are very rare people who do things for others just because. In most scenarios, people are helping people to reap the benefits from both parties and thats not what ""altruism"" is. It frustrates me to think that there are no people worth trusting on this god-forsaken planet. I just can't believe that people just suck, although I hear that being said almost everywhere I go.  I feel that I should be doing something more important with my time and energy, but I just haven't figured out what that is yet. I want to create music and I want to help mold this imaginary world f goodness where gentle souls can hide. I want to have this amazing place where people can vacation away from the worthless unforgiving world and the pathetic souls therein. The people that literally suck the life out of you because they are jealous of that beam of light fueling you on through one obstacle and on to another...

I guess I just wish that there were more NICE people in the world. I wish that this life wasn't so corrupt and mutated.

I need to sing and write more, this is my start...

Another thing on my mind is really the people I have known; who just don't care anymore. There are people in my life who have made a great impact in my change or growth in this lifetime. There are people who have inspired me to be a better person and live with integrity in a bold colorful youth."

"event","In Tucson, I am hustling and bustling around trying to stop my head from popping off. I am crazy busy with work and can't manage to shut my mind off when I really need to unwind. I know it comes with the territory of my job and I'm sure it will get easier as time goes on, but right now...I'm swamped. I am busy with work and still barely have any friends or social activities here to speak of. I spend most of my time working on stuff in my apartment or hanging out with Dave. I do give myself ""me time"", but I'm still pretty loney. I love spending time with Dave and I'm glad we live in the same city now, its very comforting on a daily basis. I miss all of you from Flagstaff, I miss the random nights of bars, hanging out or chillin at Dennys. I know I won't find friends here that I would feel as comfortable as I do with you. I'll be up to visit soon, I'll be coming up for Tour De Fat and I'm really looking forward to being there again. I like the way my life is progressing here, but there are still things I wish I could organize faster- I hate having to be patient due to my own schedule. I just wish I could make most things come to fruition so I don't have to keep thinking...when am I going to finish this or that. 

The new frog tank is done and thats one thing I can check off of my list, but now I really need to attack my apartment because things need to be more comfortable. Right now the apartment is still in its beginning stages. I need to unpack and rearrange furniture, get new furniture to replace the old stuff that just doesn't serve the right purposes anymore, and get the proper tools and utensils sor my house. I have a list of things I want to get that will help to get everything into place so it actually looks like I live there. My Mom and sister set up my room and it looks beautiful, but the rest of the house needs to be done...I'm officially annoyed. I need to get my TV and stereo up and running. I need to get cable and internet ready to go. I need to make my apartment feel like home because it just doesn't feel that way yet, but it will...

I miss all of you and I hope you are doing well!"

"event","I spent most of my day by the pool yesterday, working on my tan and trying to relax my thoughts. I was just laying out with my phone on vibrate and a book, it was such a nice day. Later, I sat down to talk to Faith about the silent-conflict we've been having over my residence here. I needed to know if I should start looking or if I am ok to relax. We both agree that Jack needs training and that hopefully it will improve the activity in the house. Therefore, Jack will have his training starting the 21st and then determine where we go from there...hopefully things will improve!

I went out lastnight around 10:30ish with Evan and Georgette and had a blast! We went to see Harry Potter around 11pm (very lame, not worth seeing in the theater)and then we went to a bar called THE RED GARTER . Afterwards, went to a sex shop because Georgette is planning out her bachelorette party ideas and indulging in ""couple"" fantasies (so happy they are!). 

I had such a nice time, getting out of the house, doing random things and having great company. It just felt good. Thank you Josh for yelling at me to get out of the house - good suggestion or command =)"

"event","I'm reading BOUNDARIES, a book Dave's Mom has been letting me borrow and its pretty good so far. Its interesting to read about your life through other scenarios, but its also pretty sad that there has to be a book to help you notice the problems. I am hoping this will continue to open my eyes. According to Dave's Mom, I have problems with setting boundaries and respecting them. I'm reading this book to get a better idea of how to handle this deficiency of mine. I am learning alot about myself and my situations (past and present)...

As far as Dave and I are concerned...I'm still awaiting his decision as much as everyone keeps telling me ""there are other fish in the sea"". I want this one, but unfortunately for me, its not about what I want at this point.

I'll keep you posted. Hope everyone else is doing well, there seems to be a good amount of people having relationship issues right now...GOOD LUCK!"

"event","What constitutes sex and what is considered intimacy? There are so many lines within the conservative and liberals circles that can be compared and contrasted. My psych of sex class is very stimulating and really get the discussions going; that I've always wanted to discuss. There are some who believe that sex is just sex and then there are other that say sex is the binding of intimacy, but then is there intimacy without sex? It amazes me to boggle these questions because there are so many opinions from so many different people. Men, Women, parents, children, siblings - who knows what IS right and what is moral or appropriate, who dictates where the line should be?

Any thoughts?"

"event","I feel so lonely lately. I don't really have anyone here whom I can really lean on when I need that shoulder to cry. The people I vent to consist of Mom, Midget,Josh and sometimes Dave. However I don't know who I want to talk to because the responses to my venting (which are unnecessary) are not positive in the least and never seem to comfort me (with the exception of Josh). Josh is the only person who knows how to cheer up no matter how I feel. When he doesn't agree with something I think, he'll tell me honestly yet still cushions my feelings without giving me sugar-coated crap. I miss him so much and we talk as often as we can, but its still not the same as having that shoulder to cry on...literally. 

My family is semi-supportive about what I think and feel because they say they just want me to be happy, but its really what they want to make me happy (or at least should according to them). Daddy gives me honesty no matter how bad it might hurt, but I guess there's really no one to depend on at this point. Its like what they always say, in the end, all you have is yourself. This statement has always made me feel so lonely and now I'm living it so take it from me...its true. At this point, there is nothing to do, besides keeping myself busy so to not be lonely anymore. I guess I finally have to force myself to adjust to solitary lifestyle. I am hopefully moving into my own place without roommates and I'm looking forward to it. In my own place with my own space, I'll be ""on my own"" and won't have anyone to help hold me up no matter what. It will be me and Jack, thats it, well and the frogs and gecko. I'm ready to grow up, I don't really have much of a choice. 

I need to get back up on my own two feet and walk tall, its onward and upward from here."

"event","""Deep Water""

You find yourself falling down
Your hopes in the sky
But you heart like grape gum on the ground
And you try to find yourself
In the abstractions of religion
And the cruelty of everyone else
And you wake up to realize
Your standard of living somehow got stuck on survive
When you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
And when you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love
You wake up to realize your only friend
Has never been yourself or anybody who cared in the end
That's when suddenly everything fades or falls away
'Cause the chains which once held us are only the chains which we've made
When you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
And when you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love, love, love
It's nothing without love
We've compromised our pride
And sacrificed out health
We have to demand more
Not of each other
But more from ourselves
""Cause when you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
When you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love, love, love
It's nothing without love
It's nothing without love"

Well, Jack is getting his training every Saturday mornign @ 8AM starting July 21st for 8 weeks. My roommate threatened to throw us out because of Jack's behavior and the fact that he plays too rough with her dog. Then (of course), there is Dave and the fact that Jack can't play with his dogs cause they're in doggie-hospice. Jack terrorizes Dave's dogs and his backyard...thats not fair to anyone. I just don't want to give up on him. Its not Jack's fault that he is a wild breed. He needs to be trained and if he is still ridiculously difficult then maybe he does need a different owner- that is my final decision. However this means that I have to discipline myself as well. I need to be home with him as much as possible because he should only be in his crate for a certain period of time. I still don't understand why he was much better behaved when he was a baby, I guess he's just in a rebellious stage- he's just a young spirit. 

Training starts July 21st - wish us luck!"

What possesses us to want to bury ourselves alive? Its suffocating and painful and just another escape from the reality you're tryign to avoid; which you eventually have to return to unless your dead. Even in death, you probably don't feel any better, you're probably weighted down by the guilt so much that your feet never leave the ground and you are burdened with that shame for all eternity. Sometimes death is so tempting to try to escape our mistakes, our pitfalls, but its really just a selfish way of running away and being a coward, and its not going to make anyone feel better. I'll just sit here and when I force myself to get up, it will just have to be just one step at a time.

It wasn't a big party and it was still chaotic. I know that life is chaos in general in its all powerful impermanent ways, but this is ridiculous. 

I have been here for a little under a month and I'm just not happy. Dave and I are in pretty good shape I guess, with the occasional ""lover's tiff"". My job is the same thing I was doing in Flagstaff with the same company, but at least the pay is better. I am trying to jump through all the hoops necessary to have a decent life with all its perks...it just feels like its never enough. I know I've worked hard, but I still have so far to go and I guess the question is...do I want to suffer the inconsistencies now to eventually have consistently happy future OR be happy now and be miserable and possibly alone later? I just don't know. There are so many things that happen (to people I know)that make me evaluate and re-evaluate my life and the perspectives I might have. Yes, I am rambling in vague concepts of misery. I'm really not miserable, just frustrated because honestly, I know what I want...to succeed...in what...maybe its too much to ask. 

I know I want to succeed in my professional career. However as far as the rest of those areas, nooks and crannys in life; I just don't know what I want. There are days when I wish everything would happen all at once and things would be set in the ways of motion (for the most part). Then there are other days where I get mad at myself for thinking that way because I should be taking my time and enjoying my youth; I'm only 22, why am I thinking abotu marriage, kids, and complicated life additions. Then there are just some days where I wish I could take a vacation from life. Just drop everythign and get the hell out! Go to the beach, jump on a plane off to another country, go to open-mic-night in front of total strangers, leave without telling anyone and see if they even care. My Dad used to say, when you make a positive impression on people, you can tell that they care because they'll think of you when you're gone...""those people know who they are and know who you are because of the person you have been to them"".
I do try to make a positive impression on most people who cross my path, I don't care how stupid other people might think that is because its what I do. I rate people on how they react when I say hi! Its amazing to me how many people don't say hi back! Then there are the rare few who say hi, smile and tell you to havea nice day - they are complete strangers, but something about their happy energy makes you feel better. I guess thats what I try to do, make more smiles contagious because you never know who will really need it that day.

Since I have been in Tucson, I haven't had much to smile about and I wonder if its because I just haven't had the energy to keep trying as hard. Then there are people who just constantly bring me down because I can't improve their disposition...it does make me feel bad that I have no affect on you (even though its not my job to make you happy, I still take pride when I do). 

I'm definitely having withdrawls from Flagstaff - my friends, my hang-outs, my bands, my music, my opportunity to always meet new interesting people and learn stuff from complete strangers. Here, people aren't that friendly and I don't know why. People are very selfish and stop caring about their neighbor and don't want to make friends...why not? Yes, there are bad people and people do bad things, but there are good people too; aren't they worth meeting? I guess I'm just frustrated because I was really hoping to just jump back into my life down here, with friends, music and my family being close; I thought all of this would be comfortable. Stupid Em...life just doesn't work that way. Life is suffering until you have nothing to suffer from, but I guess I just live in this illusionistic world where I keep thinking that there is something worth living for besides careers and the ideal ratrace. 

On a happier note, I have a meeting with my new band on Monday so wish me luck. I have heard good things about my future musical endeavors and now I'm definitely ready to make my dreams more realistic. I am tired of waiting for something exciting to come into my life; I'm going to have to make it happen...here I go.

"event","So YAY its almost the end of the semester and then I can move back to Tucson and start all over again. I am still looking for a ""real"" job for when I get down there, but I don't really have to worry about it until August when all my school is done and my degree is offically posted. 

I want to move back and get my life a little more organized, I already have a part time job for when I move back and an apt (that is still a little sketchy), but mostly I'll have my space away from the family, but still close enough. I know how much I'm going to miss everybody (you know who you are) and I will visit Flagstaff periodically because I love it and will need to get my fix of Flagstaff friends...hopefully once a month or something like that. Everyone else who is moving away, hopefully we will keep in touch either via livejournal, myspace, email, or IM...one way or another.

Good luck to everyone in all your endeavors and keep in touch!"

"event","Sometimes, I'm not entirely sure when someone is joking or completely serious about random and ridiculous statements. There have been many a time that I have been discussing certain subjects, that to me; even contemplating them is considerably ridiculous-then it turns out that those discussions weren't to be serious...this completely confuses me about the mindset of the individual I am TRYING to understand. Then when they are joking, I can't help but question the fact of whether they are talking to me trying to be serious in a logical conversation from the start or whether they are completely full of it and ""pulling my chain"".

This confusion causes me to have completely irrational responses and the thoughts just don't make sense anymore. I just react and definitely without thinking manage to upset those I know, care about, or even love.

I really wish I could take a step back and analyze the situation before I barge in with my ridiculous and unorganized tactics of conversation....basically my delivery sucks and as much as I might try to work on it, I simply fail. I can be so diplomatic and direct at the same time when I am counseling someone, but when I am trying to have conversation with those who are close to me...I completely botch it up!

damn't I am so frustrated right now!"

"event","Ok so my last post was an update on those people who pretty much have their goals figured out. I'm very happy for them, but as far as Josh is concerned-I'm really going to miss him. This will be a great opportunity for him and I think he is going to do amzing things as will most of my friends. 

I guess its just that no matter how old I get and how much we all grow up, I'm still not a fan of change even though it is the only thing constant in life. After college, everyone moves away and contacts get lost or forgotten and I have really enjoyed being friends with people especially in high school and college, but now or at least very soon-everything will change. I like where I am right now, but I am definitely ready to spread my wings and fly out of this small town (although I love it so much, theres just not enough opportunities here), but at the same time I'm pretty scared to start all over again. I know I'll meet new people which is something that keeps me going day in and out, but I really don't want to have to be separated from the ones I'm already so attached to. When Dave moved, it was sort of ok because I knew he was more than ready to be done with school and I had only been close to him for 9 mos which definitely created quite an attachment, but I was ready for him to move on. Now when Nicole moved, it was just such an alteration in my world because she isn't here to go see anymore. I can't just drive up the street, have some tea and chat like we used. She has moved on with her life as well. I guess I mostly fear losing people like I have with most of my Maryland friends whom I grew up with...they just don't care or put the effort in. I try to keep in touch through emails, letters and cards, but I can only do so much.

Wherever you go, I'm happy for you and can't wait to see what opportunities come you way!

Goods luck everyone. Keep in touch!"

Heather has a beautiful baby Hannah and still wants to marry Kyle (not the father, but would make a great one)

Monica is still happily married to her military man with their son Isaiah

Hady is officially engaged to his Heather, the mother of his daughter Jasmine.

and everyone I've caught up with recently seem to be very happy -Congrats to all of you!

I'm graduating in May and most likely moving back down to Tucson, eventhought I have been trying to think of other options-there aren't any right now. Josh WILL get into GIT (I have no doubt) and will be even more amazing than he already is and maybe someday bring our band back to life; unless he moves to Finland and marries some beautiful European girl!

"event","Ok so after reading a rant that someone wrote about me, I just have to say, you are none of my fucking business. Your ""love of your life"" happens to be a good friend of mine and I just want him to be happy; if its with you then thats great, if not then oh well. 
You made it very clear that you didn't want me to have anything to do with your life at all so I did what most normal people would have done...I shut you out as you did me. I figured that if I even said hi to you in passing, it might cause some sort of ulcer in your sensitive emotional body. I did try to be friends with you and I'm sorry if you thought I was trying to dictate your life. I am not you and in my experience when talkign with others, I try to picture myself in their shoes and try to think of what I might do in their situation-you didn't have to take it to heart, you could have taken it with a grain of salt for all I care. I was just trying to understand what it might be like on your level. I use this imaginary thinking with everyone I'm talking to because its pretty difficult to sympathize or even agree with anyone's thought process when I might just think you're just ranting...then I stop listening, like most people. 
I did try to be there for you and yes we do have immense difficulties, but just to let you know I have reconciled my differences with my past. I have sent letters and actually had conversations to show there are no grudges anymore. I don't like to hold grudges. As far as I'm concerned, they just create more problems thanks to all the burden of stress that is completely unnecessary. I don't know you and with the ways you have been acting and reacting, I'm pretty damn sure that you don't want me to and to be honest I'm not that curious at all. You are your own person and you have had your hardships that apparently have shaped your view of the world and the people in it. I hope that at some point you do find some sort of happiness instead a massive distraction from the suffering that you just can't let go. You have so much in front of you (from what I can see, but then again what do I know?-you might see it completely different) and could be making the best of what the future might bring from the situations and opportunities you allow yourself to have (in case you didn't notice , thats an option, not advice by any means).

Whatever happens in your life, you'll either choose to enjoy the good times or fester about the bad ones that you just can't tuck away....either way, its none of my business. 

Oh and concerning ""talking behind your back"", this doesn't occur unless people bring it up and I simply reply with ""we were friends once"". There is no reason for me to portray some sort of explaination for who you are...you can do that yourself if they are so curious to know you.  I don't waste my time with stupid drama or gossip, I don't have time for that shit anymore than you do. I have other things at the top of my priority list than to babble on about you. Whatever happens with you in your life...thats your life-I have no need to be in it or talk about it unless you are in my presence and even then...I just don't care anymore.

Have a good day.
*the one who sounds like your mother"

"event","BEST BIRTHDAY EVER! -thank you Josh 
Ok so usually its very hard to surprise me with anything, but Josh is just awesome. 

Yesterday Jack and I went over to hang out with Shawna, Lucy and Aaron to drink hot cocoa and watch some movies. It was nice catching up with them since I hadn't seen them in over a month. After spending the day there, Josh and I had plans to go out for sushi for my birthday so we invited the cute couple to join us. Dinner was great adn very filling (unlike usual). We took some pictures, made a toast and enjoyed a wonderful meal with great company! 

Afterwards, Josh, Shawna, Aaron and I went back to our apartment and Josh was leading the way. As we get to the door, he opens it for me and escorts me into our dark apartment. As soon as I step foot in the door, everyone yelled ""surprise"" and popped poppers and confetti and it was just so cool! You guys are so wonderful! Apparently Josh had been planning this for weeks-he even bought me Chamborg to make a drink for me that he had while he was in London (Chambord Lynchberg-DELICIOUS). He went to certain people with handmade invitations and he is just ""the best!"". As I scanned the room, everyone who I could have imagined was there, including some people I would have never expected. By the next hour, the room was filled with Drew (s.g), Tim, Zak, Syd, Kyle, Shawna & Aaron, Sean, Wayne, Jake, Chris(s.g), Parker, Rico, Rod, Ashley & Chris, and Dave (he came up from Tucson) and Josh ...and Jack( my dog)

It was great! You guys are so wonderful!

After a while, most people left to do their own thing and so we all went downtown-Josh, Chris & Ashley, Jake, Chris (s.g), Dave and I. I went to The MAD I to visit Delanie and I got my birthday spanking that still hurts. Then we went over to the JOINT to say hi to everyone and have Conner make my birthday shot and then enjoy a ""clarkasian""-chocolate milk/alcohol mixture (YUM). Over there, I saw, Ty (the bouncer), Hana, Marie, Rico, Rod, Rachel, and Suzie came in too. I had my birthday shot (sex with an alligator-green and brown layered drink-very sweet) and my birthday drink with Rico (Vegas Bomber all the way baby!) and then I had a ""snozzberry"" (the snozzberries taste like snozzberries) over at the MAD I -some blueberry drink mixture. That was my evening and it was awesome!



Thank you Shawn & Aaron for the mugs (hot chocolate *wink*)

Thank AShley & Chris for my ""fairy & fairy dust""- ""extracted from real fairies""-Chris

Thank you Syd for my awesome pants- only person who could find Tinkerbell and Skulls!

Thank you Dave for my very cute Tink lamp!

And thank you so much to all of you for going through all this trouble...IT WAS SO AMAZING. I'll never ever forget it!"

"event","""The LORD your God does w you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.""  Deuteronomy 31:6.  So um. Where to start.  I feel like my life is contanstly changing.  Not too be dramatic, but I have been thinking and I have had an incredible life, full of wonderful expierences.  A wonderful childhood, a wonderful teenager years, and now growing into an adult.  I was blessed with a wonderful family and friends my whole life.  I grew up living in an apartment buliding with best friends everywhere, but it saddens me to say once junior high hit those friendships faded.  But I gained the greatest friends a girl could ask for.  Alot of ppl lose touch after high school but I realized who out of those ppl are my true friends.  It is pretty sad that some of my best friends in junior high and high school dont even talk to me nemore, but the truth is, if I was still the girl I was back then, wed be friends, but since I have changed, we arent.  This past year was intense for me.  I had to step out my comfort zone.  I actually told my whole public speaking class this story.  I grew up as a cathloic girl, always going to church because I was told to.  I went to youth group because I had to.  I always kinda enjoyed it, but would NEVER admit it, I would just sit and complain with my friends about how bored I was.  I cheered for my church so it kept me involved.  I was a cathloic girl, not a christian.  So my mom left the cathloic church because she didnt agree with the man made laws nemore, but I wouldnt leave because I loved cheerin for the church.  I use to go to church to see boys on the basketball team.  My mom was saved while I was in high school, but I thought she was Obssessed with God.  She drove me crazy.  The more she talked to me the more I pushed her away.  The further I got from God.  I was into my friends, drinking, partying, guys, and not living a life with God.  I was like mom, I believe in God, I am a good person, I am going to heaven dont worry!  Funny huh? I wasnt even that nice of a person.  I had friends who were stuck up, and therefore I had the rep of being a snobby cheerleader, I would never stick up for peers when my friends were mean to them.  I would never stick up for anyone.  I realize now some of those ""friends"" werent friends.  So on mothers day my senior year I went to my moms church.  The play Heavens Gate, Hells Furry  was being performed.  That was the day I knew my life had to change.  Soon after that I visited FSC, and thought, ""THIS IS IT""!!! I am going to grow spirituality.  So i left my life behind and went!  So I met an AMAZING christian girl, and we got close.  She took me to a ministry and held my hand as I cried and stood up with many others who were proclaiming they wanted a life with Jesus Christ.  So then after that I met a really nice guy.  He also helped me in my walk.  He told me that he could see there was more to me, and to just be myself.  He prayed for me.  So soon after that, things fell.  The girl had started dating someone and I barley saw her, and he stopped talking to me because of all the drama at the school.  SO where did I findmyself? Back in the game of drinking and guys.  So soon after that I started feeling sorry for myself.  So what happens next? I think I NEED A BOYFRIEND! So I start dating a ""Christian"".  Well...everything went down from there.  I put God on the back burner and this boyfriend became my life.  So once school was out I went home, none of my friends wanted to associate with me becuz I didnt drink nemore, WELL one DID! and the only reason was because she was a Christian =) But we didnt hangout that much, and I had a few friends but not many.  So basically my boyfriend and I broke up.  And i felt so alone.  I realized that I needed to put God first, and he was the only one who was going to fill that whole.  And that he gave me singleness as a gift, so I could spend my time growing and pleasing Him, and that the day I was ready hed give me my prince charming.  SO I deciated my summer to Jesus.  I fell in love with Him, got baptized by the HOly Spirit. WHOA.  =)  So then it was time to pick a school.  Was I gonan transfer? NOPE..I was going to stay at FSC becuz I realized I could find Christians newhere.  But WHAT?  A BEEEEAAUUUUTTTIFUL girl named ERIN started emailing me about PBA...and she was a blessing from above =)  Soooo I went to youth group and saw that someone had a PBA shirt!!!!!! So I was getting all this signs like WHOA.  SOOO I prayed about it like crazy.  And finally God told me, ""Jamie GO TO PBA"" I realized it was not about ME, and it was about HIM, I was scared of leaving my comfort zone, but I knew to glorify Him I had to obey.  So here I am..and I feel like I lost all my friends at home..and lately I dont feel like my friends at florida southern care either...and im kinda lonely here too.  Like I dont feel like ME...I use to be sooooo happy...soooo fun...sooo crazy and hyper...so active..now im always doin hw..maybe its part of growing up?  I uset o be so friendly and outgoing and now im MISS SHY...i hate it.  I guess I have to give it time.  But its like I get intimated by others sometimes.  I feel like they are better than me because they have been Christians for so long.  But then I realize we rnt suppose to do that, I am growing and I am in love with that =) I guess I am just ramboling, tomm is going to be great, ill go to church and be happy, I guess I am going to stop feeling sorry for myself because I am so blessed, who else has paretns drive them around the world? Haha! Well I know thins will turn around...cheerleading tryouts this week! whoop! I mite be goin on a mission trip...ohh the Lords blessing me..I have no reason to complain! I just have to organize my time better so I can have fun too =) Ok bye all! =)"

"event","Ok so ya..Im in one of those moods....So PBA is like awesome...exatly what I excepted...everyone is in Love with the Lord and its so amazing to see.  I really like it!  But I was having a rough time getting use to it..I was def comparing it to FSC, and always on the phone with ppl from FSC..when I realized I have to let go..its okay to be friends and keep in touch..but I should be bonding here....I realized so many ppl have made such great bonds and connections and I honestly havent.  Don't get me wrong everyone I met has been amazing.  But for some odd reason I have been sucha baby here.  I thought I was over this..But like I dont like to go to things by myself...and I am like scared to meet ppl.  Like lets start off with EX:1...boy calls A MILLION times tryin to meet up with me, but since im scared I always just ignore him...blew that..where he was an amazing child of God and could have been a great friend.  Then there were so many ppl who offered to take me out and I never took them up.  I never take invites newhere, and I dont act friendly....so I went to campus ministries and I prayed with someone there, I am thinking of joining the prayer team and another ministry, I think im going on a mission trip toooo! So ill meet ppl there...then theres cheerleading..a passion of mine..but they had like open stunting and I never went..and I thought of not doin it then i thought hey i kinda do..and i never went cuz i was scared..intimadted..why do i have such low self esstem and no confidence.  Im thinking everyone is better than me, everyone knows eachother, blah blah...o my gosh I should suck it up...and GOOO if God wants me to do it ill make it! if not its not meant to be..but whats the worse that can happen..i dont make it..really not that bad, btu for some reason im still so scared.  Its like im scared of all these new things, but i should be excited, and the sooner i do them the sooner ill be comfortable.  Then theres the point im always doin school work i never have time for nething, i need to work on time managment..if ne1 is reading this please pray for me..that i can figure out my time skills, and that i can have mroe courage and confidence, and that I can act the way God wants me to and be friednly so I can make better connections with ppl.  I hate how ppl can talk online and then its like so different in person..I mite just give up the internet...its so gay..thanks to my roomey im realizing this..I know God sent me here to step up..and I cant think hell do everything..I have to stop bein sucha baby...I need to go out have fun and relax..I need to join things, and not be scared to go places new.  Ok im gonna go study but I had to let this all out..."

Im goin to miss u also like crazy! But i know well keep in touch.  Well neways I pray I wont be anxious or shy.  I need sleep but i cant, I am about to step into a new enviornment where my life is gonna b changed...am i ready? I hope so ; )  Sometimes life moves so fast and we arent ready, but we have to be.  Who knows what this year holds, but im excited, if I cheer, get a job at the hotel, end of with a boyfriend, have amazing friends, go on missions, get into ministry, who knows, but i kno this year holds alot of amazing things.  I was thinking of how my life keeps changing and i just wish i could have one place where I was happy, but I realized God blessed me with PBA and an amazing upcomin year, he blessed me w amazing ppl at fsc, and amazing family, and even amazing friends at home.

"event","Well I leave for Florida in ten days..wow.  We are flying down to West Palm and then driving all the way to Flagler beach becuz a friend has a house there and is driving my car for us.  So then I get in my car and drive back to WPB.  So Ill be a lil north for a day.  If ne1 wants to see me for a day please call.  Cuz Ill b there kinda near Daytona if u dont kno where Flagler beach is ; ). Then I will be in WPB for like 2 days be4 I have to move in so if ur south give me a call =)  I wanna see ppl b4 school starts!  So then I move in the 23rd but welcome week starts the 4th.  I AM SO NERVOUS!  I am tryin not to.  I dont want to claim up and being unfriendly.  Do not be afraid, little flock, for your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.  Luke 12:32.  I have always been shy before I met ppl thou.  I just hope I don't claim up.  I mean SO many people have been so kind to me ALREADY!  Ppl have offered to show me around, giving me their numbers, everything.  So maybe instead of being a shy baby I should take them up and be friendly!  I just feel like im bugging ppl cuz they have there group of friends already.  Soooo the roommate situation, I talk to her,  but she isnt coming back.  Residence life said dont worry they wont make me pay for  the whole suite, but theres a big waiting list and they will put sum1 else in..Kinda hoping its not a freshman and its a transfer.  That would be nice.  I am going to try REAL hard not to worry, and when I go there be open minded, friendly, and myself.  I guess I havent decided on cheerleading, maybe Im scared of failure?  Cuz I have to get a job for my car and to save, and then plus school work, and plus campus ministires, plus community service, plus I want to get involved in so much stuff, like clubs, intermurials and just be involved on campus.  I regret not doin that at fsc. I guess I have to just Trust in Him it will all work.  
So my last day is Friday at work, still have so much to get and errands but im really hoping I have some beach time and some time with friends.  
So this may seem a lil crazy.  But I want to write it.  I have read alot this summer.  The first book was about purity, and so was the 2nd.  I also bought a modesty book, and now im reading captiviating, and I kissed dating goodbye.  I kissed dating good bye isnt about never dating again.  Its about entrusting your lovelife to God and that God has something better for you with a life of sincere love, true purity, and purposeful singleness.  So the author Joshua Harris reminded me of myself, someone who grew up, in relationships, and found happiness from the opposite sex, and even when it was a pure relationship it still wasnt right, because it was what was fulfilling his life, and his time, and his happiness, and the wrong reasons,~>SOOOO ME!  Singleness is a time for you to find the Lord, to grow in Him, become more like Him.  Its your time to find YOUR purpose, YOUR happiness, and when everything is going beautifully one day, OUR BEAUTIFUL KING will BOOOOOM send u a great mate...you just have to TRUST!  and me, I never did.  I ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.  Ive been asked out this summer, but I realized, this summer had to be for me and Him.  In the book a girl confesses a d ream she had.  When the man she was marrying was holding her hand at the atlar, 6 other girls came up and held his hand, and they were girls from his past that he has giving his heart to.  I dont want to give my heart to a million different guys.  That saying ""Youll date a million guys"" I dont want that.  God says ONE man, and even thou I have had then men of my past, starting now, I only want to have ONE, I will only give my heart to my future husband.  So as Joshua Harris said it, he didnt date till he was ready for marriage.  Girls today put so much pressure to have a boyfriend, or  be married.  But as crazy as this sounds...I heard so many ppl who didnt kiss till marriage, and well I have been thinking about it.  In one book it says to put a line at how far u would go, and I said kissing, and it said okay, now try to go one above and set that as ur goal.  Well I know many ppl would say that its nuts, and u need to kiss, but im starting to think, if you could find a guy who truley loved you, and the Lord, they would do it, I mean its not for me, and for the Lord, and I mean relationships fail because of sexual things, and even thou kissing isnt bad, I know some christian spend so much time kissing that there is no realtionship.  I know its possible.  I know their are guys who would do it.  Might b a long wait.  But I trust Him.  Not saying I def feel this way, but if I date someone might be something to consider.  I mean how amazing would it be to have the first kiss at the alter when u say I do, u may kiss the bride!  And U know u would have an amazing relationship that was bulid off of friendship.  My book has u write about ur future husband, it says to wait, and I will because I know its worth the wait, and i never looked at it this way, but if u start praying for ur future husband and thinking of how u want him to be, u will fall in love with him, and ever time ur tested or tempted u can think about how much u truley love him and u will wait for him.  Save everything 4 him.  So many girls think their boyfriend is it and love them so much, but then they are heartbroken later cuz they gave themself away, and then when they do get married it hurts they didnt save it for the special one.  I will not let that happen.
I bought a real journal, and one goes with my purity book for prayers n such and the other one im going to start writing in it so i dont  always have to write it in here.  I dont really like the fact this is online-but i just love to write.  Ive always liked to write.  I love poetry.  Im kinda a deep person.  Everyone always looked at me as the ditzy peppy cheerleader.  Guys kind of just looked at me as the cute lil jamie but i dont think ne of them really ever tried to get to kno me. I use to see on tv how girls were hurt and couldnt trust again, and well I always said Im not ready 2 date again, but would anyways, and well now, i am really scared.  I know God has someone so amazing and I just have to trust Him, but I am having such a hard time trusting Guys.  Like I have been hurt so many times, and lied to so many times, and I just feel like I have lost all trust.  I dont want to be like that thou.  I really dont. But everytime I trust too easily, and then I get lied to, I trust, I get lied to again, its a cycle. I know Im about to enter a college where alot of guys are in Love w the Lord and arent like that, but im still scared, like how do i know.  I really have to trust the Lord with this.  Even as friends im scared =(  Well I just have to let Him take care of it, and I know hes got some nice surpises in store =)  

Wait for a man who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who has the patience when you're just having one of those days, who will sit beneath the dark sky and ask the Lord to show him if you're 'the one', or will hold you in his arms whether you're sad or just for no reason. Wait for the man who kisses you in the center of your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you're not feeling pretty, who holds your hand in front of your dad, one who is constantly reminding you of how much you make him a better person, loves being with you, and how he's the luckiest man in the world to have you. Oh yeah, and when he's with his friends, he says, 'that's her.'"" --If he doesn't have all these things, pray hard about it. But if he does, still pray about it, but never pass up a chance to encourage him in the Lord even if he's not ""the one"". God will bring him to you in His timing Trust in Him.

So Im really trying to work on TRUSTING HIM, as well as buliding a stronger relationship.  I mean I have come SO far, but I really got to work on just dwelling in his presence every second and remembering its 4 Him not me!

So Brittany told me she is gettin engaged be4 fall break! Married in 2006! Ohhh Boy Congrats sweetie I am so glad God has matched u two so perfectly =) I cant waittttttt for the wedding and to see u oh so beautiful...as always! and be patient for that nite ; ) ; )

Have you ever wanted to be someone else
Have you ever wanted just to be someone
Have you ever wanted to reach your dreams
Have you ever wanted life to be more than it seems
I have tasted of a love so wide
That it stops all my time
I have tasted of a love so deep
That it blows my mind
Have you ever wanted to reach up and touch the sky
Have you ever wanted to pack it up and say good-bye
Have you ever wanted someone to care
Have you ever wanted someone to be there
He is sweet, He is sweet
What your looking for
Is my sweet, sweet Jesus
What You're looking for
Is my sweet Lord

Lately I have been going to work, and spending time w my family, I havent seen many friends so I hope I do soon!!! I cant wait to get to school and get my life on track, I just feel like I do not really know what my dislikes/likes are, what I enjoy to do?  Well maybe I should do cheerleading.  Ive always loved that.  But I want to use my talents for the Lord but Im not sure what?  Maybe I should start writing poetry again.  Or taking photos.  I have to start doing things for myself too.  As well as others.  My poetry has always been about feelings, with guys, but im thinking of how beautiful it would be to write for my Jesus.  I need to stop worrying and just let it all work out.  Goodnight all..I love u ; )"

"event","What an A M A Z I N G summer it has been.  To think when it started all I could do was thinking about going to FL.  How much I hated it here.  And wanted to leave.  Now I am VERY excited but I kinda don't want to leave.  Me and my mother have came SO close, we have always been extrelmly close but now its like WHOA! I remember last year in FT Laud when the song In my daughters eyes came on and I almost cried I called my mom to tell her I missed her, and Jamie, Lauren, and Heather were all like I hate my mom!  Everyone thinks im crazy cuz me n my mom tell eachother everything.  There is nothing im ashamed to tell her, shes like my best friend.  Now that I have the Lord in my life, its been even better.  The relationship we both have with him has broughten us closer! We get ice cream together everynight, have gone out to dinner, shopping, and most importantly, AMERICAN IDOL!!!!! A M A Z I N G night I might say!
I was baptized on July 12th!! O my gosh what an expierence.  It was during tent meeting and they let us join in on the worship it was so beautiful.  Just being dropped in to the water in His name and being freed of my past and knowing Im not the same person, but most importanly...that night, the angels were dancing cuz so many people, young, my age, and old, had glorfied Him =)

When I think about the Lord
How He saved me, how He raised me
How He filled me w/ the Holy Ghost
How he healed me to the uttermost
When I think about the Lord
How he picked me up
Turned me around
How he set my feet
On solid ground
It makes me want to shout...
Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus
Lord, You're worthy
Of all the glory, and all the honor
And all the praise!!!

That song says it all! When I think about the Lord Im just sooo happy! He really changed me.  A few months ago I was sitting in my dorm room, stressed, and unhappy, and WHY, becuz I didnt know My Jesus!!! I was NOT doing things I am proud of.  But...because God loves us so much..he sent Jesus to save us! How amazing? The stupid lil things we do, HE DID FOR, he SUFFERED FOR...how can we NOT do our part and live for God! I think people think life is here and now..its not..its in eternity with Him..and eternity ALOT longer then here I might add!!
I just read a gift wrapped by God, and the bride wore white...WOW..what helpful books!!It helps girls keep that gift for their future husbands.  It also helps girl who have givin it up, realize that they can become pure again.  Jesus died for that, he forgives u!!!! One book talked about not kissing till ur wedding night, I donno if I could do that, but then again after reading this book its changed my perspective on so much.  First of all..I just bought a modesty book, I went shopping, no more mini skirts and low cut shirts for meeeee! I am HIS princess and Im going to dress like it =)  It talks about how God has made guys the way to desire us, and if we dress SEXY then we LOOK sexy, and as a Christian girl its our job to help our brothers in Christ and not dress like that! wow I never thought of that before!  Plus who wants to be with a guy who is with u for the way u look! This book made me realize singleness is such a gift.  This summer being single has giving me a chance to grow so much closer to Him, to make a real relationship.  Im listening to new music, dressing differently, even reading! But thats not even it, I realized EVERYTHING I do is for HIM, each day I try to dwell in his presence each second, yes its hard, but thats what its about, my relationship with Him.  I also realized there is no reason to settle, to just date anyone, I begun praying for my future husband, that God helps him face his challenges and stay pure.  I also wrote a vision statement of the women I wanna b on my wedding night.  This book really helps.  And as much as I regret the things I have done in my past, I know thats in my past, and Jesus forgive me, and any man who loves me will too.  I know my wedding night is going to be perfect.  Any guy can say hes a Christian, BUT dont settle for just a christian, wait for the one who has a relationship with Christ, and can challenge u and hold u accountable.  Someone who will pray with you, and love God first then you second.  The relationship wont hold together without the three.  
Okay so I am thinking about getting a job at a hotel, I will have enough time.  But then I think I kind of want to cheer.  I really need to get involved, thats part of the reason I was unhappy last year.  I can only do one, if I cheer I can maybe get a babysitting job.  I can always do the hotel job in the summer and leave MB haha! Or if I stay at school work down there and take classes.  I need to get involved in the ministries or find a local church.  I also got to do community service.  Maybe Ill look into some clubs.  Theres so much I have to do before class starts, but I cant stress.  The LORD blesses his people with peace-Psalm 29:11.

So yeah, I never even heard of Shane and Shane till this summer, and NOW im In Love ; ) they are like contagious haha!  And I get to see them at the end of the summer! Heck ya!

Its funny, cuz u know what I heard alot this summer, ""So your one of those religous people""  ""So ur one of those God people"" ""Did you meet someone in FL who changed u""

Yup I did, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! Heck Ya, and Im proud of it!!!!

People are like Jamie don't become one of those freaks, or dont become obsessed..Ok that bothers me, I YEARN FOR HIM, and I am In LOVE with him, and there is nothing wrong with it...He is the one who provides JEHOVAHjireh   the one who heals..HECK YA he HEALS JEHOVAHrapha   The lord is Vicotry Banner JEOVAHnissi   The lord is our Peace JEHOVAHshalom the Lord is my shepard JEHOVAHraah  the Lord is our righteousness JEHOVAHtsidkeno  and lastly the Lord is present omnipresent friend JEHOVAHshamnah.

So yeah at the begining of the summer I was so bummed, I felt like I was going to be so bored because I felt like everyone wanted me to drink, but I STAYED STRONG, HECK YA! Ohh and I miss my stephy =(  its been long hunny, 20 days, we neeeeeeed to chill! Angela has been a big help too, us getting our nails done together n such =)  I love my friends, and I would never ditch them cuz I am living my life as a Christian now, it just bummed me out, cuz they were all sad I wasnt going to drink or party.  But I stayed strong..I didnt see my friends as much as I would have liked this summer but its still been amazing time.  I worked alot too.  O and I saw Jesus Christ Super Star..    A M A Z I N G!!!

So I took a week off of work so before I go to school so I can relax and see people..so dont be afraid to call me =)  I cant believe this summer is almost up.  I do miss Lauren, Jamie, Nicole, and many others.  Its so amazing how God puts so many amazing different people in your life.  Jamie and I are SOOO completely different people, but Im am utterly blessed to have her, I love her! I need to see her SOON! She understands who I am and doesnt care she loves meeee still!  What a great B A B Y ; ) Ohhh I miss sonic, how I want a smoothie!! haha!

This year has been an A M A Z I N G ride.  I learned sometimes we have to do what God is leading us to, even if we are scared.  Stepping out of that comfort zone for a little bit, will be worth it in the end.  God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spiriit of power, of love and of self-discipline 2 Timothy 1:7.  I had always put guys first, and still wasnt happy, I learned its not about where u are, nomatter where u are, you can be happy, you just have to seek what u want, keep God first, and keep ur relationship with Him.  But I learned OBEY him, and follow Him, he wants MORE for you, so follow him! Its so amazing the way he works, the way he puts ppl in ur life.  The way he can change u.  I am so thankful that he had me see that play about heaven and hell, that he had me meet the christian at fsc, and that he had come home to stephy and the other amazing people who have helped me.  Thanks be to God for his indescrible gift! 2 Corinthians 9:15.  No matter what happens, seek HIM! He has a reason for everything, and it may seem like the end of the world but trust me he will come throu!!! just be patient! Its worth it!!!!! Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.  1 Thessalonians 5:18.  Trust me sometimes i know its incredibly hard, but if hes the one you love the most, its alot more simple!  U know sometimes I want soo badly to be someone who can Shout out the love for him to EVERYONE, I thought about being a pastor!!! I thought about doing retreats and writing books...I want to help people! I thought about opening my own book store.  He is just on my heart and I want to bring others to Him.  Those who are wise will shine like the brighness of the heavens, and those who lead many to rightoouesness like the stars for ever and ever Daniel 12:3..but I know I can whitness in my actions.   But I just want to Glorify him and bring others to Him!!! I want to fulful my purpose, and take my talents to glorify him, just not sure what they are! ha. Well I am majoring in communications and minoring in Pysc, but I could always change my minor to Christian leadership.  I guess we will just be patient and see where he leads me! Ok Im going to run now, Im MUY hungry =)

In Him,

"event","Im really sad, I mean REALLY sad.  I don't know what to do.  Lets start off by saying my brother left home.  I feel SO bad for him, he seriously is so lost, I wish he would come to the realiziation he needs God, but all he does is make fun of me and call me "" Jesus Freak"" oh does it hurt to see someone you care about so much so far away from God.  All he cares about is his girlfriend, and his looks, he has to have huge muscles, and be hot, and also always have the hottest gf w the biggest boobs.  He has gotten so bad he was doing steriods. He got in such a big fight wit my parents hes out.  We dont know where he is. Please pray for him.  I really want him to turn his life around, stop lying, stealing,a nd pay his bills, no more stealing from us, and lying, and getting kicked out of colleges for drinking.  Hes almost 25 =(  Next is my dad, there is so much wrong with Him and he is loosing his job and he just doesnt have the health to put up with my brother.  Please pray that my dad will have the strength and get healthier and stop letting my brother make his health worse.  Next is my mom, they found  a lump on her cervix n shes goin in for a ultra sound tomm to find out if its a tumor,PLEASE PRAY FOR HER.  
Ok now me.  Ohhh man.  I seriously do not even feel like I know myself nemore.  When I went away to college I truley found who I wanted to be.  But I didn't live it.  Now that I am home I decided to go to PBA, right, and I thought Id be so happy, but now im thinking back to FSC and how much I  love Jamie, nicole, My roomey and everyone and im getting so sad.  I just keep thinking this is my chance to go to a christian school, to get the long time friendship ive been searching for, why should i give this opportunity upp.  But then theres the fact that if I go to FSC I can have NO BILLS TO PAY BACK, at least this year, and I can take hotel management,wat if I dont get a job I want cuz I just took business...Well I guess those r things I have to TRUST in God for,but I seriously do not even know if imgoing where he wants me.  I dont know where he wants me.  Im so lost and hearing so many things,and I feel like Satan has a huge tug on me.  I feel so upset about leaving FSC,and I dont kno if its Satan tryin to get me from growing radical in myfaith or what.  But I do kno I wasnt happy atFSC alot.Maybe I am just nervous about leaving my comfort zone.  Hopefully after awhileI will be comfortable at PBA.  Why did I want to leave FSC, I WASSNT HAPPY, but there were some amazing tgitimes that keep going in my head and i know i could be happy id have to change my atmosphere but u kno everyone does that, but I feel like why would God give methe chance to go here if he didnt want me to.  I just dont want to pass it up.  But then im like why would i leave somewher ei was happy, well i wasnt always, and I feel as if I go to PBA i will grow and that God will have great plans for me.  I reallythink Satan has got a good grip on me.  Lately I havent felt like I have known  God, I want to hear HIS voice, and I want Him to be the center of my world.  I have been so lonely lately, have I pushed him away? I don't want to doubt him,but then again I want to TRUST HIM, ALWAYS, and I dont feel like I am, why am I havin these doubts, why wont satan let go of me =(  Why cant I accept my choice, u know either one I choose I would have doubts, and thats a lack of faith. WHY WONT SATAN BACK OFFME! I have been super lonely, i havent done nething but work all summer, I really need to go out.  And its horrible cuz I feel like i have no1 at home, now i feel like i have no one cuz im starting brand new at school.  Its like whenever i come home i go on these drives and im like WHO AM I, but at school i never had these feelings.  I am so frustrated, I just want to be happy. I want to KNOW MYSELF, I want to know HIM, I dont want to be lonely, I just want to be plain happy,  I know I have God, and I need to continue to grow with Him cuz I think Satan is really workin on me right now. I want to continue to grow, tomm I am getting baptized =) but I have to remember I dont do these things for ME they r all for his GLORY! I guess thats its for now.

Dear Heavenly Father,
Ohhh Amazing father, how you seem to AMAZE ME EVERYDAY by ur blessings ;) Oh God, please do not let Satan or anyone elses words get in the way of me truley hearing ur word and following it. Dear God please do not let me go.  I pray to continue my walk w u, only to grow stronger and closer to you.  Father please let me TRULEY trust u, show me not to doubt you. Father I want to KNOW you COMPLETLEY, and I want to grow closer to you. I want you to be my first LOVE and for me to do everything for YOUR glory, please father let everything I do reflect ur love, and let everything I do be for YOU.  I Love You Father.
In Jesus Name,
Amen

"event","I am so torn, I figured maybe typing this all out may help.  I had listened to everyones voice but the one I should be listening to.  So yesterday I did the best thing for myself, I did not talk to ANYONE, I took my car, filled the tank, popped my worship cds in the car, and drove to the beach, walked the water and prayed and read my purity book.  The whole time I was filled by the Holy Spirit presence telling me to suck everything up and go to PBA God will make it work, hell help me.  So I return home happy with my decision to find out FSC was offering me 18000.  11000 I wouldnt have to pay back! WOW! So I was so upset, I mean yes I could make it work at FSC.  I started thinking maybe I never gave FSC a chance, I hated it so I locked myself in my room n talked to Josh all the time, but now that I have God in my life, I am happy, and I can get myself involved in the ministries to meet new people, and I can get involved and go on a mission trip, and do community service.  I keep reading how I am here to Glorify God and this is only my part time life, my life is in eternity with HIM, so wat I do here is only a test, and to be honest, this school decision I have been burdening him on, really isnt a big deal, wherever I go he will be pleased as long as I continue my walk with him, and help others come to him and Glorify him.  So yes FSC, logically answer, no loans, I could get a job, take hotel management, have all my credits, get involved, hopefully make new friends and get involved.  Then there is PBA, which when I hear about it I just smile and get all warm inside.  I have Erin who is amazing, and Mr. Joshua Drew, who both told me they would help me catch up and take the classes I havent taken.  Both I know will help me meet ppl, and I know there is so much there and so many Godly people who God will have for me.  I know there is a awesome opportunity, we go to school once in our life, but what wont I have there, I wont be able to get a job, and save, and I will have to take more classes and work a littler harder, plus summer classes, and Ill have to meet everyone and be brand new atmosphere.  But I just smile when I think about it there.  Sooo as we see it, I am torn...Im going to go, I think Im going to take my mom for an ice cream, and then spend my nite with Jesus =)
In His Name,

"event","So things are really good for me right now.  I have ALWAYS put a guy before me and God.  I have always instilled my happiness in guys.  Well after this relationship I realized I need to be happy with myself first.  I also realized that all of my love should be in God.  I should love God more than anyone or anything.  Never should I put anyone or anything above him.  I have been struggling with my faith for awhile now. People have seen me at some pretty low points.  There are people who judge me and say stuff like ""Shes not a christian, or shes faking it"" But whatever, they do not know me, I have sinned and made mistakes like everyone else, but it does not mean I can't decide to give my heart to the Lord and start a Christian life.  Anyways it doesn't matter what anyone thinks accept for the Lord.  So neways I have been really happy lately, just at a peace.  I knew with Josh that I wanted a Christian guy and I tried so hard to push him to change, but that was wrong of me.  I know God has someone so much better out there for me.  I guess I thought Josh was something he isnt.  Not that it was all Josh fault, but I want to be with someone who does not try to take my purity, someone who loves the Lord, and will walk and grow with me.  Not someone who goes and get drunks and has random hook ups, and lies and acts like hes ten.  I learned alot about myself, and my walk with God.  Since I have been home I realized so much.  Even thou Josh may not have helped me grow closer to the Lord but his actions, our relationship opened up so many doors for me when it ended, and opened my eyes, I know God has everything happen for a reason and I thank him so much for the relationship I had and how it happened because that is what made me realize how  I need to have all my love in God.  I can concentrate on my love for Him and when the time is right he will send me an amazing guy.  Its funny how when u think things r so horrible u realize they r the best thing that could happen to u.  Its also glad we broke up when we did, be4 we got too attached.  Trust me I drove the kid nuts calling so many times but that was cuz I did not know wat was going on with us, but God was helping me there, trying to tell me to get out of that relationship, it was not heathly nor a good one, he was not the right guy for me.  I thank God so much that I learned wat I did.  I could not be happier now.  Im going to look at PBA and I really want to stay in FL but I dont know about FSC, I know I am strong enough to stay away from temptation, and I know I can find a group of Christian friends there, and still have my other friends too, but at the same time I keep thinking about how amazing it would be to go to a school where God is about of the mission.  Where worship time is important.  Where things go on.  But theres the credits.   I do not want to go to school an extra year.  Then I do not know what I want to do.  I want to major in ministry, I would love to do something for other people or for the Lord, and I would also love to work in marine bilogy, or communication.  I just have no idea.  I have to hurry up its getting  late.  Well I called a few places about retreats, I might go to one on the 4th of the July, up North In NH.  I really want to go to some confrences too.  I am reading  a really good book about how to find comfort in the Lord when things are messy.  I have been making more God time lately, just reading and worshiping.  Me and Steph went for a ride tonight and just listened to one of my worship cds, it was amazing.  The hours at work are stinky but hopefully it will turn around.  O yes and me n linds are going to NYC to visit jamie soon!  I miss her.  MY REAL BABY. haha!Im tryin to get involved in some community service too.  Well I think thats all for now.

"event","So Im Single! Not really upset, weird eh? I thought if we broke up I would be devasted, but Im actually perfectly fine.  I think its cuz this last month I went throu so much with him neways that I was just tired of it.  Yeah we had some good times, but even thou the REASON we broke up is the distance, theres many other things that just did not help, the lying, for example.  Neways, I got to go to work today, but everything is going really well, the weather is AWESOME!  Now that I am single I can stop worrying about Josh and start having fun, and let the summer begin, I was having a horrible time, but times are about to change =) I can't wait to start beaching it! My apartment in FL next year looks like it m ight actually happen!!!!! Neways I gotta run n get ready 4 work. Have an amazing day everyone! Love <3"

"event","So, as much as I wanted to go to Calvin, I think God is telling me to go back to FSC, only 4 classes would transfer plus my summer as core.  My mom says, I have grown so much, and will continue to this summer, if I go to FL I just have to be strong, she told me to talk to the chaplain, about getting involved and meeting new people, my mom said maybe I could even help some people. So I wish whoever went to my skool who has been posting would tell me who they were so maybe they could help me next year.  Its going to be a rough year, but I know it seems to be where God wants me."

"event","So, I am really stuck in the mudd here.  First of all I came home to not being so happy.  My boyfriend and me have not been the same.  I guess I was just feeling selfish because I was not hearing from him as much.  But I understand he has friends and a job.  He also has a friend who can't stand me, and I feel so bad for him because it hurts him so bad.  I tried calling the girl but I guess she just does not care.  But I came to the conclusion that breaking up with him would not solve anything because like it or not I LOVE HIM!  Next we do not see eachother much, nor will we, but I am willing to wait for him.  I have been upset and emotional lately but things should turn around.
Moving on...
Growing up I have always believed in God.  I went to college planning to strengthen my faith.  I met a boy who changed my life.  Then I decided I needed to transfer so I could grow in my faith and be surrounded by other Christians.  Sometimes I find myself juding, and if I do that I am not a christian, I think I am just so confused and hungering for it, but am not sure what the answers are.  I wish I did.  So I have been unsure if I was willing to leave FSC or not, so I had just found out I do not know how many credits will actually transfer, no more than 20 will be electives, and that suxs.  I figure if I go to a new school, I will be surrounded by Christians and things that are Christian based, I will have friends to go to ministries, retreats, mission trips with.  I will have friends to talk to about my faith, and go to chapel and different concerts with that are at Calvin.  But then I think, If I stay in FL, I could maybe cheer, that would keep me happy and out of bad business, and  I could go to different minsitires, and meet new ppl, and I could do the Sunday Sandwhiches thing to homeless, and I could go on trips and meet new ppl.  I am just so confused and so unsure what to do.  I feel like if I go to FL i will have wasted 1600 of my parents moneyd riving around.  But if I don't go to FL i wasted a year and money at FL cuz of credits.  I am just so confused and keep praying that God will show me the right way.  If you could  please pray for me! 
Thanks!"

"event","I do not know if its the time of the month, or if it is just me being extra sensitive.  I HATE that I feel like I am always being judged or ridiculed here.  Yeah I am not perfect either, and I probally complain or talk about people just as much but I try so hard not to.  I feel so down.  I do not know how to explain it.  Whenever I talk to Josh I am so happy, all my problems go away.  But I hate how people judge me.  Just because we havent been together for awhile, I do not care if anyone understands us.  We are happy thats all that matters.  Why do ppl feel to make commments..no one asked! We had some issues because of some of his friends, but I talked to one of his guy friends and he told me that those girls are immature and to ignore them.  And he was right, why should I let them effect me and Josh.  I felt like it was my fault Josh was fighting with his friends, but if they can not understand that he is happy I guess hes right, they are true friends.  Anyways its not my business about HIS friends.  But it is my business when my friends say stuff.  I wish they would stop making comments, I am happy, who cares if I want to talk to him, who cares if hes what makes me happy, who cares how long its been.  Ugh people here talk so much crap behind my back and I hate it.  Or even to my face.  And then people wonder why I am wanting to transfer.  I know what I want, what makes me happy, if you do not agree WHO CARES!  I have never felt so bad.  My friends back home have never talked so much crap.  I miss my friends back home so much, I just can't wait for my finals to be done and to be in Josh's arms again.  I am so over being talked about.  I am so over people judging and saying crap.  Maybe I have made mistakes, maybe people think I m a bitch but I am sorry, and if that is the case, why should I stay here?  I do not want to be somewhere where everyone thinks so low of me.  Yes I love so many people here, and will miss them if i leave.  But at least if im at calvin ill be happy, ill be doing the one thing i want, and i might even be with who i want to be with.  Ughh I can't wait for these 2 weeks to be over, SCREW YOU FSC!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Do you ever have so much on ur mind but you just push it away so you can be happy?  Well my issue is a complain but never do nething about ne of it.  So I decide to forget and not worry.  But really I still worry and it never goes away and I continue to complain.  I have not written in here for awhile and I guess its because I realized anyone can read this.  Well I really want to get some stuff out.  I really love writing so this is where I came to.  People say that I complain too much.  Which is true.  I have tried to stop and improve because I am so blessed its incredible.  I have two amazing parents.  My mother is my best friend.  We have the best relationship, I can tell her anything.  I have a father who loves me so much and is such as passionate loving figure.  I have two lifes, one in the north one in the sunny FL.  So I am trying really hard to realize what I have and not complain.  Also people here don't all think highly of me.  I guess I still have some maturing to do.  I remember in high school when people would say they walked by me and I did not say high or I gave them a dirty look.  Which was not me trying to be rude.  It was cuz I did not see them.  I do that here too.  I need to be more observent.  Also sometimes Im a lil shy and when I do not become miss friendly when I meet someone they think im snobby when its actually me being shy.  I need to change this.  In high school I was not the kindest person.  I mean I had people who thought I was a snob but usually people who got to know me thought I was a sweetheart.  But I feel like here people just judge me. I guess its my fault.  I say things I should not say and do not always mean.  I am working on this too.  I want to be a better person.  Someone who does not judge and say mean things.  What else am I working on? Well I stopped drinking, right? I gave in...Lately I have not been drinking again.  I try not to say I never will again becuz if I do its a lie.  But I figure I can have a drink here n there, but I have no desire to get drunk.  I pray that I can stay strong and feel this way for a long time.  Im done hooking up with random boys.  I feel like I have lost who I want to be.  Everyone says in college u find urself.  I always grew up as the ditzy, little, snobby,cheerleader.  I had so many friends and was always having fun.  When I left I was in search of something greater.  I found it, I found myslef, I was so happy.  But I lost it.  I know what I want, now I just have to stay true to myself.  I dont care what anyone thinks.  I have grown up and matured but obviously I still have more to learn.  I try hard to be strong but everyday people here make me feel crappy.  They tell me im a bitch or a snob.  They tell me I could not go to a christian school, like they know school, or know what I want or am looking for.  I got into Calvin.  I want so bad to go, it seems like an amazing school, I think I could be myself there.  I do not care to go party go out n get drunk.  People here may read this and think im full of it but i dont care.  I am satisfied with watching movies and having girl nights and having a steady boyfriend.  I may seem like I have changed my mind but I have not.  I was lost, and this is what I want.  I also am looking at PBA i got in.  So we will see.  Part of me wants to stay here.  I just am so unsure.  I guess its worth it to start over. But there are people I do not want to leave =(  I guess I have to put it in Gods hands.  I have to stop worrying about what others say and follow my heart.  Theres another area where I have to follow my heart and not listen to others.....I guess sometimes I am not fully trufully with people here becuz I do not know what they will think.  But you kno what screw it.  I dont care.  There is a boy that I LOVE TALKING TO and I DONT CARE IF HES MILES AWAY! I believe that God puts certant people in ur life for reasons.  I also believe that its better to make it work with someone who you want to be with even if its hard rather than date someone just cuz its easy.  I told myself never to settle.  And I wont.  If I find what I want I wont let them get away.  We are spending spring break together so we will see from there.  You know what if you do not understand, I DONT CARE. Its my life not urs.  I dont need to question.  I know how I feel.  So I was thinking of staying here till June.  I would get to take two summer classes.  I have to take classes cuz im credits behind.  Id rather stay here n take them then go home n take them.  I wanna go home 4 the summer but theres ppl i wanna see here too.  If it comes down to it and I go home I guess I can fly here or take road trips but I need to work.  I think it would be easy to take the class, visit with ppl, and then go home.  By the time I get out no1 is home yet. But by June everyone will be.  I got a D on my theology test.  I was upset.  I hope to do better on the next.  I have a D in hortoculture but hopefully I do well on the next two test.  I need break so I can relax n stop worrying even thou Ill end up doing hw.  I guess I have alot on my mind and I need to make decisons so I can stop worrying.  Well Im going to go watch dawsons creek and add more drama to my life lol.

Alot has changed this year and so have I.  But I started to do stupid things and after I was just disapointed in myself.  I had no idea why I would do stupid things.  Now I know exatly who I want to be.  Alot of people hear think Im a bitch, or concedited, or other things along those lines.  That is not what I want people to think of me.  I do not want that repuation.  I guess I gave it to myself.  But I need to worry more about my character than my repuation I guess.  SO I got into Calvin.  I think that would be amazing for me next year but I want to stay in FL so we will see about PBA.  People are trying to tell me I WONT LIKE IT, like they know me.  I wish people would stop judging.  No One hear knows me, or what I want or feel.  Theres a real big issue going on in my life right now, yes a boy problem lol, but I do not want to write about it in here.

"event","Well coming home has been much harder than excepted.  I think I have had many tests.  At school I am surrounded by people who drink, and I still do not fall for the temptation.  Here I have yet to drink.  Sometimes I miss the drunk nights with my friends, or just having a few drinks.  But then when I say who cares lets do it, I remember how I always feel afterwards.  But its like what if I do at some point decide to have a drink, am I going to be falling for pressure and failing?  I feel like I have no one to talk to and I just do not know, who is of authority to judge?  No one understands me.  I came home to the realization of why I went far away.  My brother has many problems and he has gotten alot worse.  If this was not an ONLINE journal I would right about it.  But he has two addictions.  And they are bad.  It hurts me and its so sad.  My father is sick and I feel like I do not even spend enough time with him.  I feel like crap because my mom does so much for me and I do not even show her how much I love her.  Then another thing happened at school.  A friend of mine trusted me and I went behind her back and lied.  I preach about being a good christian girl.  Well since i Have been home I  have no illustrated that at all.  I want to continue to grow not fail.  I am so stupid sometimes.  Even if she forgives me I am not going to forget how I did this to someone I have not known long.  I need to start thinking and giving people more respect and let them trust me and have a reason to.  I thought I was alot more mature and grown up, well I still have to learn alot.  Vacation has not been fun, its been work.  I am sick, I left work today, and I am getting run down.  Tomm is new years and I went from going to Canada to Boston to know doing nothing.  I mean new years day I am going to Boston so maybe I should just stay in and rest  cuz I am so sick and going back to school soon and working so much.  I guess I'll see what happens.  I hope this next semester will tell me 100% if i should leave or stay.  And I am going to try to work on some things that I need to change.  I can only hope for the best.  10 more days...

"event","I don't really know where to start.  But I am home and there are so many thoughts going through my mind.  First of all I want to go back to FL so bad.  I wanted to come home so bad but now I hate it.  My best friend only talks about how she misses her UNH friends and her roommates.  Last nite I went to my old Church with my mom, it was a cathloic Mass*(cuz we couldnt make it to our church cuz I was working*)But i Saw so many old ppl from H.S. some drunk..N i knew why I left this place...I always say I miss the North and I need to go back but F IT...no I dont..The south is a better place for me..I want to live there someday..  I have alot of friends who I do want to see and who say they want to see me, but I dont know I feel like no one here knows how to have fun without getting drunk and thats not my idea of fun anymore.  I also work all week so I dont have much time.  I really want to go visit Jamie in NY and go shopping but I don't know who will come with me.  I really want to go to Boston and I think I will with Denise.  Then theres New Years, I have no clue what I am doing and I hope something comes up soon because its my only time to actually go do fun things so I want to.  Then comes the Transfering Issue....I am starting to get use to Good Ol FSC..I came to a small school for a reason...and part of me wants to transfer to UCF or FSU or FAU because I want to have alot of ppl in my dorms, have guys to hangout with in the dorms LESS DRAMA...and all of that.  But that defeats my whole reasoning for transfering.  I want to transfer to a Christian school(Ppl do not comment because I know what you all think)  No Fsc is not a Christian school, its methiodist based but the schools I applied to are Christian schools.  I just want to be surrounded by Christian kids so I can continue to  be on the right path.  But then again, I love my roomate dearly and I do not know if I am going to leave.  I dont think I am, I dont know.  I am thinking of staying at FSC over the summer.  No reason for me to come home other than work but if I get a job in FL I can stay at FSC.  My roomate is thinking about it to.  I am alot more happier down there and theres enough people from Florida that I could hangout with that I adore ; ).  It would be alot of fun.  Sometimes I wonder why I gave up drinking. But if I go back to drinking Ill feel like a failure because I have came so far.  I am so confused on so many things.  To all of my friends back home if you want to see me be4 Jan 9 call me and well plan something fun, otherwise u might not see me till next thanksgiving..if u care.  I dont know what to do about school =(    In Florida I grew up alot, I realized I came so far, and I am so happy. Theres one thing missing.  A <3.  =(   I have been hurt so much I always push them away.  But its time for me to let someone in!  I am just so picky! All I want is a Christian Boy =****(    Why can I find one?  I Hate this , when I am home I see so unhappy, I am so confused and I thought writing in here would clear things up, but I was wrong.  I dont know about so many things.  Im sick of thinking.  I just hope things will turn around here.  I gotta go

"event","Home...yeahhhhh, I could not WAIT to come home...but why am I not so happy?  Last night me and Katie went shopping and It was great to see her but I was so tired I came in and went to bed around 10.  I had to work 10-7 today and then when I was there they asked me to stay till 8.  Next week I have 45 hours.  Im excited I need the money.  But its like now I cannot go out as much.  But I guess this is growing up.  I want to go to Boston with my girls.  I want to go sledding..it better snow!  I want to go ice skating! I want to do fun things while I am home.  Not just sit in and be boring.  Lol.  So yeah I really hope it snows...it hasnt yet! =*(  I really do miss my girls back to fsc.  I really never noticed how close we had all gotten.  I have wanted to transfer for awhile now, but we are all so close, but you know they are transfering too...but then again I need to be strong.  I am transfering for the reason of wanting to be surrounding by a more Christian atmosphere.  But then again there are things at my school that I could be involved with.  It will be so hard to leave my friends behind at FSC...but then again maybe its better?  I need to do the right thing.  Home has been kinda sad, my brother and mom fight constanly.  Im reminded of how screwed up my brother is and how much he hurts my mom.  I noticed WHY I left this place.  Yeah I love my friends here..I love my family, but I know now why I left.  I left because I was unhappy, don't get me wrong I use to have sooo much fun...but when I went away I believe I did alot of growing up and maturing and I changed.  The things that were important to me are now superficial.  I realized I left to meet new people, to be on my own, to get away from my family problems.  Well when I went away I got the best gift anyone could ask for, I found God.  And everything after that moment in my life changed.  Now its weird, because I am lonely at times, wishing I had somebody.  But there are guys who have asked me out, but I know what I am looking for now and I do not want to just settle.  Sometimes I feel like Im wasting my time, and everything that I have done has been a waste. Maybe I should just go back to how I was.  But then I remember why I am doing this, and It brings a smile to my face.  I want a guy who is a Christan, who has morals, and respects me, and can care to know me.  I know back home I have never found anyone like that.  Once again another reason I left.  To get away from my old life and old me and the boys who only want to get some.  I know boys are like that in FL too but it has been amazing for me starting over.  I really wish I had someone to talk to.  But for now the only one who I feel like explaining this to, is my journal.  I need to do some thinking.  I need to decicde if I want to transfer or stay at FSC.  I need to decide what I want.  I hope this vacation turns around soon.  
Much <3

"event","I feel so lost, maybe its just because its that time of the month soon, sorry folks but this is my journal! Im really emotional today. I said some mean things I normally wouldnt.  The other night my friends all went out and I didnt go with them.  I didnt feel like it.  You know what I did? I sat in my room all night long crying.  What is wrong with me?  I am so homesick.  I miss my mom, my dad, my dog, my house, my bed, my friends.  It does not feel like christmas.  It isnt snowing.  I am not the one to complain to people. I feel so lost. Im really lonely and I hate it.  
I have had boys here but never anyone I really feel for, yeah crushes are nice...and Ive had been dates but come on when was the last time I had a really good relationship? Lets see...I was talking to a kid here who I thought was so perfect for me, but I messed up and ruined that one. Or the many other kids I have dated the past couple years.  Justin?o wait, we all know how that ended! Matt? Yeah he treated me like a princess until the end.  Aaron? hmm...two years ago? I really think the last time I was truley happy in a relations would have to be Matt or Aaron, all the other many guys Ive dated have ended so badly.  I guess Im just sick and tired of being hurt.  Everytime I have something good I push guys away.  Or I run.  I am so scared of being hurt.  Why cant I just let a guy in? O thats right because I have a broken heart =(  Which way do u lead ur heart when its broken into so many pieces?  I want so bad to be happy again.  Its just that I know what I want now, and its hard to find.  I know hes out there.  But its getting lonely while I wait and keep pushing them away.  
Then theres all my friends.  I talk to Katie and its like, I miss her tons.  And I miss our summer and prom and everything! Like here I do not drink anymore, Ive changed.  I feel like If I go home my morals are going to go away. I want to stay strong. But Im happy with my friends.  We want to go to Canada and I think it be a good time.  Im tempted to transfer to UNH, or even UCF or FAU with Heather and Jamie.  I have so much thinking to do and so much studying to do.  Maybe Ill go for a run around the lake tommorow.
You know what my dream here is to do...is to spend an amazing night with a special guy....spend the whole day together, and then at night go to the beach, walk the beach, then spend the night there just looking up at the stars and watching the sunset in his arms...but we all know this is only a DREAM but a girl can dream...it be so amazing here because its so beautiful outside.  Im sick of the guys who take you out just to watch a movie and make out.  Yeah trust me my perfect night would be the cuddling part but I want to go out and do things with a guy, get to know him.  Thats how it was with me and matt, when we first became a thing we were at the beach looking at the ocean.  I want a guy who really wants to know me.  Who Ill get that amazing feeling with as he holds me in his arms.  Someone I can talk to.  O well thats what I want for Christmas =)  Santa please?????? 
Heres some things Ive wrote lately.....

Im not going to lie
I didnt want to hear goodbye
You were everything I have prayed for
But you didnt want me anymore
You were different than everyone else
You saw and liked me for myself
Most importantly I saw Christ in your heart
Thats why I didnt want to be apart
God must have had you come my way
So my true self would always stay
If we were not meant to be
God has someone else for me
Someone evening more amazing and great
That is what we call fate
And hes worth the wait
Jamie Leigh Maggiacomo 10/8/04

Spending the whole night with you
On the beach the entire night through
Looking at the stars just gazing
Is this too amazing?
To just wish for that one night with you
So everything can start over brand new

Nomatter how hard I try
Ill never find another guy
Who was so perfect for me
I wish I could see
That this should be fate
And another guys is worth the wait

Maybe a little two negative.  I wrote these before.  I kind of what to write some more.  I should be sleeping  but I woke up and Im wide awake. Only one class tomm so Ill sleep after it at 9am.  And then Ill study the day away.  I think ill run the lake too!!!!!! Theres so many things going through my head right now.  Special times. Dreams. Hopes. Wishes.  Oh man! 

Let me all know what you want for Christmas ok!

And If you want to see me over Christmas Break leave me some <3

And I thought I was the only one but when I went home all I heard was how much we all missed eachother.  It seems like here at college everyone is meeting there new best friends.  But for some reason everyone back home continues to say that their hearts are in Nashua. I think its awesome we all noticed how much we mean to eachother and how lucky we are.  Even people  I was not that close with say that they miss Nashua and the people there.  I may not be in Nashua but that is where my heart is and always will be. I love and miss everyone so much. 3 weeks!"

"event","As I sit in my dorm room I realize how FAST my life has gone, and how thankful I am for everything that I have.  Its amazing how fast we grow up.  I realize I get to have two sets of amazing friends and two homes.  I get the warm and the cold.  I get the beaches and the snow.  I am blessed with an amazing family.  I feel like yesterday I was starting Elm St with Katie..we were so nervous wed get lost! haha! Or then going to High school, the football games, the drama of HS, prom, graduation..all of it has such sentiment to me.  Ill never forget those amazing times.  Everyone says in college you find your true self and its funny because I have.  I have changed so much.  Its funny because before I came here me and stephaine both said wed probally go home not drinking and changed, and well its true.  Its funny how things happen, but like I always say, Everything happens for a reason.  But I thought coming here was going to be different than it is.  Growing up I have always had tons of friends.  I guess when I was younger I always had the repuation of the ditzy, snobby, cheerleader.  But when people got to know me, they got to know I wasnt like that, theres more to me.  I mean back in freshman year when people told Aaron not to bother because I wouldnt date him.  It bothers me when people are like that. But that was a long time ago.  But I think Aaron helped me be less superficial.  But I truley feel that college has changed me alot, I feel as if I have looked past the silly things that use to be important to me.  Drinking every night, guys, and partying.  Everytime something bad happened id always say no more drinking but hey I didnt care I did it again.  Even after the night with cote and them.  But now I just look at things so differently.  Not to sound stupid, but I am proud of myself.  Im not longer interested in just hangout with people because of there status, and Im not longer superficial w boys.  I dont feel like I need to explain myself to others.  I am just happy!  I use to think to be happy I needed to be dating someone.  I was happy with Aaron but after that I was hurt too much.  I realized I needed to be single and maybe id find someone here at college. Well that was wrong.  I no longer will settle.  I know what I want and I know hes worth the wait.  If I wanted so badly to be with the wrong ones just imagine how amazing it will be when I find him.  I think its better to be a little lonenly now and then and wait then to be with all the wrong ones.  So Ill wait ; )  
Its funny how things happen, and how after meeting someone here has changed me.  I guess God put him in life for a reason.  I use to think it was for us to be together.  But then I realized it was God wanting me to change my life.  And he helped me.  Ive never thought of myself the way I am now. But im happy.   
Its funny how I couldnt wait to go to college to change...because sometimes back home people didnt believe one thing about me.  And I guess its my fault, they way i acted.  But here alot of people didnt believe the truth either, but some are finally realizing the real me.  I hope back home maybe people will start to believe me.  
Anyways..I am thinking of transfering.  I love the weather and Im comfortable here.. but I know its not the best for me.  I hate when people here tell me that its the same everywhere because they do not know what I am looking for.  They do not know me.  They do not know.  I am annoyed at the fact people act like someone they are not. They lie just to fit in and are two faced.  I cant stand when someone always has to be right and have everything there way or they pull a hissy. I cant take it.  I try to stay away from fights and just get through this year.  I mean they are other people here that I love and its not like that.  But what I want is to be at a christian school.  Im looking to Calvin, Olivet, Cederville, PCC, PBA.  I know that there I can surround myself by others who want the same as myself.  I think id be alot happier.  
Well things here are not so bad, but school work is tough!  I miss everyone so much but its only 2 more days! Its going to be a blast to go to the Turkey bowl and to the Holiday Stroll =) Give me a call if you want to see me because Im not working again until Christmas.  

Alright..I need to go study...I <3 u ALl!!!

God Bless!!!!!

"event","im really stuck in the mudd here.  When I first came to college it was overwhelming, but i really REALLY liked it. It got even better and I started to LOVE college.  I made quick friends and fit in well.  I was alot happier than I even was in High school.  Yet, I have always had alot of friends, but maybe just never HAPPY like I should have been. Granted I think the last time I was really happy in school was Freshman year, when I was dating Aaron, and cheering and had so many friends.  Things never were that good again until I met Matt.  But see back home I have soooooooo many friends that I love and miss.  But now, here, im just stuck.  Like so much drama and crap happened between guys and it ended up ruining things.  And I guess thats why im not happy now.  I had what I always wanted and then I do things to mess it up.  Because i was a lil unsure of giving up my past.  Well that was EXATLY what I wanted.  Now Im stuck and back to how I use to be.  Thats not what i want.  I dont know what i want.  I want to be happy like I was becoming, and I want to be the true girl i am.  Other than all of this, school is hard, and there is so much drama and gossip and crap at this school.  I hate it.  Grow up!!  Anyways...I just need to straighten myself out and do what my heart tells me.  There is ONE boy I have my eye on....hes a sophmore...but I just want to stay concentrated on school.  I cant handle anything right now, I have so much school work and other things to adjust to first.  Anyways, im stuck, I miss my friends, and I wish things were easier.  But I guess I have to keep trying, never give up.  Well thats all for now, Im glad I got to write in here and let some of this crap out.

Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!
Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.

Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me.
(In the paper the next day):
A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. 2 people were on it, but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.

Then another part of me sits n thinks i really fcked up bad..if i didnt have so much H.S drama wed prolly b together...then once we were together but not offical nemore i became obsessive called him all the time..he prolly thought i was syco n annoying...n i wish i could change that.

Then part of me thinks i wasnt enuff of a party girl..but then another part thinks maybe i was too much n he thought i was slutty...but i cant change things n i got to get over it..it took me a long time to get over him...n im still not...i hate this so much..ive been n dated other guys since...none have made me feel the way he did..no1 has...WTF...thats y i stayed single im not ready for this shyt....

I cant wait to go to FL n meet new ppl..start over...new guys..ughhh

I have had chances wit so many nice guys..even really hot ones...n ppl r just like wtf is wrong wit u..go 4 them...seriously this is pathetic its been so long....

Neways my last day of work is saturday..i guess thats exciting? kinda scary n sad thou...

I hate the fact i dont spend time wit my family..or open up n share feelings with ppl...

I hate when ppl r dramtic drama queens..or talk shit....or judge..or r shallow..jughhhhh i cant wait to start over with new nice ppl down south.

This is a very depressing entry...bujt i have to let shyt ojut..."

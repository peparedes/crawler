I ask myself? you have this new life..new things..new options.. I find my self at the end of my wits...I don't know what to do any more..I thought that I was past this..I thought that I had learned how to let go..yet once again I face someone I love leaving me and I can't quite grasp the reality of the matter..ohh what to do what to do..ohh I know over whelm myself..like one of those married women who knows that their husband is having an affair and choose to ignore it... c'mon lets get real now..when you learn to let go of so much..you can only grasp what little you know..I let&nbsp;go of our future I let go of&nbsp; (most of) our past..I let go of our corrupted relationship..but how do I let go of her? espically when I let go of everything else for her??..I hadn't been on here in soo long I forgot my pass word..and so I had em' send it to me..***news flash** it was Never Stop... (of course now I'll change it) and it ment never stop trying and never give up..and never stop loving her...she told me August 24 that she was moving..and I cried even then..but I chose to look on the bright side... and I figured that well don't look at it like I'm loosing her in 5 months look at it as...you have five months to make her fall madly in love with you..and not leave... the only thing is..I think I suceeded in more ways than one..I managed to make her love me..have guilt about it..and I managed to fall in love with her too..again..and have a guilt trip cause I love someone else as well....so my reality bends..and I give in to the fact that I can't win...and that my one is going to leave me.. and as the tears soak my pillow..and the sobs get louder...I realize this time...she's not here to hold me and tell me how it'll be ok.. so this is it I've reached my end..I've lost myself..and I cried a river litterally..so you tell me what comes next....</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>

I miss her...Maybe not necessarly being with her..but I miss talking to her she dosen't even call any more...maybe the break up wasn't as mutual as I like to think..cause it seems to be bothering me alittle more than others..and I haven't figured out why!!!! I mean I knew it was comming I was trying to save it..and its not that it was even wasted effort..cause I love her...it's just..like I said reality that things are over..and maybe we wern't ment to be together forever but thats the way it was planned in my head..maybe not kids.and mybe not washington..but I had been antisipating our apartment for longer than I can rember..and I used to drive past apartment complexes..and think...""yeah we could live there some day""...now It hurts to even attempt to look..I hate that I wantched my future turn to ash...and all I can do is watch it blow away now..I am soo sick of this feeling..I wisht that I could be in school with PEOPLE.and not always thinking about this damn situation...sometimes I wonder if it was even love..or at elast I used to I used to wonder..if we were only with eachother because it was convient...or beacuse we thought that one loved the other as much as the other thought...but no..it wasn't convience..look at all the bullshit we had to over some..and go around just to exzist..and it wasn't that I stayed with her cause she loved me..it's nnot hard to love some one..it was gthat I was actually in love with the dumb bitch...while she crushed on a woman half our age..I was thinking I wonder what my baby is doing...wel i guess now I know..and even that dosent really bother me cause I thuoght that she loved me..but...if she really did I think that she would still call as I do her... gotta go&nbsp; back to work ttyal</FONT></EM></P>

I had anticipated leaving her from my horrible thoughts..but..at about 2 she tried to cal me again..and go figure Jen answers as always..she tells me that ""we need to talk""....(oh great here it comes) she said that she felt as though she was in an 8th grade relatioship..I am not sure how that feels or how it is even relevent to </FONT><FONT color=#990000><FONT color=#ffff00>our relationship..but..thats what I was told..I can't help but wonder who's relationship she was using as an example to put ours down on such a level of inmaturity..now..I my self am a very immature person..for thoes of you whom know Christine as well as I do (which isn't most) she's even worse than me when you catch her alone....so I don't know I guess in alot of aspects because of who we are our relatioship is going to be immature..but on so many levels we surpass even our maturity level..in veriouse ways..it's just </FONT></FONT><FONT color=#33ff33><FONT color=#33ff33>unimaginable </FONT>that she would even consider ""our"" relationship...8th gradeish.and I am not even sure if immature and petty is what she ment by it..but..I told her how I was feeling and what I thought had been going on...and she asked my why I never said any thing..well for one.I never talk to her long enough to even mention it..and second..for those of you who know me pretty well..I'm not to good with letting people know how</FONT><FONT color=#3366ff> I feel..I will kinda go around it.or hint at it if I actually want them to know bad enough..but..any way...she called me this morning..at work..and I told her that I don't concider our relationship...8th grade level..and I asked her why she did..and I guess it's just one of those things that you feel better after saying..cause she said that she did't..well... we all know.... how </FONT><FONT color=#cc33cc>that goes I guess...but I don't know where she thought that not talking to me as much was going to make our relationship..any less..immature..but hey I guess thats her perogative...</FONT></FONT></EM></STRONG></FONT></P>

She has been making up stories about smoking pot( supposedly) just to see how it feels for me to do it...but now she says she never did..and with our past I kinda have to question that..but hey..then..she left more in love with me that I was with her..and for the first two days she seems still infatuated with me..and now it seems like she'd rather be alone than with me?? I don't know maybe it's just that I haven't seen her in a month...mybe the time and distance is getting to her..but at the same time I have to wonder...if while she was gone she cheated..cause once again it's in our lovely past..now I can't go jumping to conclusions..and I can't just up and leave her for what I think ya know? but I just wish that if she did do something that she comes out with it..and if she did't that I get to see her soon enough to end her stoopid different ways..I dont know but</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>

"event","i believe it's important to be a good listener.
i believe it's important to withholding judgements and let people get out what they need to get out, make their own mistakes, etc.  this is not to be mistaken with passivity because friends shouldn't be passives about each other's well-being.  
... but i believe it is important to try to find that balance and respect it because, quite frankly, [almost] everyone already has one mother/father [at some point at least (and again i know this doesn't apply to everyone)] and doesn't need another one, and even if they did it certainly isn't nor shouldn't be me.
i believe in being there for people, especially my friends and family, but not at the cost of my own sanity.  well... i can sacrifice a little if absolutely necessary.  (no, way... i really can't.  i don't know.)
i believe that friendships are vital to my own existence.


also, you know what i hate?  people that act like you're all important to them and then drop you as soon as they can.  that fucking sucks.  i mean... perhaps there's some reason but i don't know what it is and that just pisses me off.  and makes me sad."

it's a lot of me laying on the floor in my room listening to music that may or may not match my mood, looking at the ceiling.  well, when i'm not working, which takes a good 11 hours out of my day.  but anyway, it's trying to figure out what's nagging at the back of mind.  it's not just my mind though... it's not a nagging thought so much as a nagging feeling.  which is always there for one reason or another.  maybe it's just being young.  maybe when i've been working for awhile and i have to swipe my children's snotty noses enough it'll finally stick with me how silly some of these preoccupations are.  or maybe it'll just be that there are so many preoccupations outside myself that the one's on the inside will take a backseat.  or it'll put things in perspective.  or maybe not *shrug*.  either way, there is always drama everywhere.  i just try to push most of it away from me these days."

"event","""We Will Become Silhouettes""

I've got a cupboard with cans of food, filtered water, 
And pictures of you and i'm not coming out
Until this is all over
And i'm looking through the glass where the light bends
At the cracks
And i'm screaming at the top of my lungs pretending 
The echoes belong to someone
Someone i used to know

And we become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...

I wanted to walk through the empty streets
And feel something constant under my feet,
But all the news reports recommended that
I stay indoors
Because the air outside will make our cells
Divide at an alarming rate until our shells
Simply cannot hold all our insides in,
And that's when we'll explode
(and it won't be a pretty sight)

And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go"

"event","Yesterday me and five other friends packed our bags, borrowed some of IES's sleeping bags, and headed for the Great Wall.  Sleeping on the Great Wall is illegal, but people do it all the time anyway.  We hoped in a cab and headed to DongZhiMen to catch a bus to Mi Yun.  By the time we sat through 3 pm rush hour traffic (I think rush hour in Beijing is from noon to 8 pm), took to the bus to Mi Yun, and from there got a ride to the Wall, it was already dusk outside.  We paid for our entrance tickets and just started walking up this road.  Since it is ""illegal"", we weren't sure if anyone was going to stop us, so we walked with slight trepidation.  There was barely anyone in sight, however, and we just casually walked our way right up to the wall.  We got to the dark wall sillohueted against the deep blue sky as the final hints of light were fading away.  

We walked to one tower but Matt wanted to go higher, so we decided to trek to the next one.  The path to the next one dipped up and down like a V.  For some reason, as we squinted to use our night vision it didn't register with any of us that perhaps the loose bricks and lack of proper maintenance suggested that the next tower would not be as hospitable to camping out.  After climbing up stairs that weren't really stairs anymore, taking three times as long as we would have normally because we couldn't see anything and didn't want to sprain an ankle/fall to our death (one side of the pathway didn't have a wall anymore)/tumble down a steep flight of bricks, we came upon the next tower, which was narrow and dirty and basically sucked.  So then we went back and did the whole thing in reverse.  I started feeling dizzy as my fingers grasped the stones, searching for stability as I had to slink down stairs as tall as my legs are long.  Eventually we made it back to the first tower as darkness settled upon the horizon.  

We set up all our sleeping bags in a circle and ate the dinner we had brought with us.  It was Monica and I among four guys, and we were definitely in Boy World.  After many a fart joke, we brushed our teeth while hanging our heads out the ""windows"" in the walls.  The wind was blowing fiercely but it was a pleasant temperature.  I saw stars for the first time in months.  I coughed as I breathed in fresh air, also for the first time in months, feeling like a chain smoker even though I don't smoke.  I laid in my sleeping bag staring at the Big Dipper and felt freakin awesome.  I didn't sleep much last night, but it was totally worth it.  

We got up at 4:30 am and walked down the path less maintained, going through three towers.  One didn't even have stairs to get up into it anymore.  Like dusk, the sky was a clear blue.  In the quiet air we took pictures and looked out onto the great mountains as we walked upon bricks that had been turned into dirt paths.  Then we ate mangos and cereal and took a nap.  Some Chinese people walked past us as my friend Nelson was jumping around in his sleeping bag and took pictures with him.

They all continued on a hike that IES had sponsored, and even though I had originally planned on going I decided to make my way back to Beijing instead since I haven't had a real night's sleep in a week.  It was so worth it, and I have been wanting to do that since I got to China.  The atmosphere totally reminded me of Bolivia, everything from the wind that blew to the history (like the Incan ruins we saw) to the stars and clear air.  I felt like I was back at the school in Villa Barrientos, brushing my teeth as the wind carried my spit into the field and looking out into the dark, silent night.  I love it.

So in short, everyone, I have peed on the Great Wall, and it was amazing."

"event","So I've been having these bowel movement issues lately, and when I feel like I need to go to the bathroom I usually rush to the nearest one (which happens to be the men's room, located DIRECTLY ACROSS from my bed room).  I've been using it most of the semester, strategically trying to avoid getting caught.  To do this, I usually wait until no one's in the hall and then make a run for it, double checking to see if I hear other people in there first.  I've only been caught by the Chinese roommates twice (I think), and maybe a few times by the other American guys (who... well... I'm not worried about haha).  [For the record, there aren't many guys on our floor anyway, so it just seems silly not to use the men's room.]

So just now I went in (more like dashed in, given the current state of affairs), and when I was done I didn't hear anyone so I decided to just wash my hands in there instead of going to the kitchen.  There is only one sink, and it's right behind the range of the dorm when it opens.  The sink also has a mirror, which gave me the perfect view to see some Korean dude come walking in right as I was washing my hands.  <i>Oh my god!</i>, I thought.  He didn't look up as he walked passed me, and certainly didn't react, so I quickly shut off the water, turned to make sure he was in a stall, and then flung open the door, running out unnoticed."

[Dialogue: The Wild Angels]

Just what is it that you want to do?
We wanna be free
We wanna be free to do what we wanna do
And we wanna get loaded
And we wanna have a good time
That's what we're gonna do
No way baby let's go
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a party 

I don't wanna lose your love (x4) 

Just what is it that you want to do?
I'm gonna get deep down, deep down
I said, (I'm gonna get deep down) deep down
Woo hey! 

We wanna be free to do what we wanna do
No way baby let's go! 

I don't wanna lose your love (x2) 

We wanna be free to do what we wanna do

Do you guys recommend any profs?  I'm not sure which ones I want to take and none of them sound interesting to me but I'm sure some of them are...

Thanks duders.  Wooo I'm so excited to sign up for classes."

"event","Today I was sitting on the toilet looking out the window when I saw a beautiful bird perched on a building next to my dorm.  It was rather simple in coloring but still of a brilliant black, blue, and white combination.  It looked misplaced against the greys and browns of Beijing, the stains on the old, crowded buildings on campus, and especially the coming sand storm.  He flew up against the wind trying to hold him back to some branches on a nearby tree, barren of leaves.  As soon as I saw it, I wanted to write about it."

I ran up to it and picked up the one on the far right only to find that it was from 2002!  And then one next to it was from 1996!  It was a sad, yet unsurprising, moment."

by Jessica Andrews

If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me 
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

So when I make a big mistake
And when I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowing 
I will be just fine
Cause nothing changes who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me 
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I'm a saint and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser; I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable
I'm young, but I am able

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me 
And they know where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me 
And they know where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am
That's who I am"

"event","I don't know...
I'm so frustrated with... I don't even know. Well, I mean... I do know. I just, there's so much that i'm frustrated with that it's hard to sort it all out in my head. I feel like i'm never good enough. I constantly screw up or annoy people or just am plain out not good enough. I hate this. I fucking hate it. I want things to be how they were. I want time to rewind and go back to a year or two ago. On the other hand I want time to fast forward and just get through this time. I want to get past all the shit that comes along during this time. 
I said to Missy the other day ""I wish it was Christmas break."" I love that feeling of the last day of school before break. I love the feeling of winter. I'd love for it to be winter break because then I could just go to work, hang out with my friends, not worry about senior or college shit. 
I like to think that i'm an ok person... but i'm not. I'm horrible. I pray every night and it's not for myself. I don't want God to help me. Screw me. I want my friends to be ok. I want my family to be ok. I'd like to think that i'm a good friend but I just don't know. A lot of my friends don't know a lot. I don't know if I can talk to them because I don't think they feel they can talk to me. I want them to talk to me... I want things to be how they were. I have a couple of my friends that I can talk to. I can tell them anything. I don't feel like they'll judge me or think differently of me. Maybe it's because one of them has been my friend for so long, I finally feel like they really care. Like, they've stuck around this long kinda thing. And it sucks because I talk to her all the time but I'll still cry and miss her so much. Everything takes up all my time. That's why I said I wish things could go back to how they were a year ago. I think it's an innocence thing. Not that I was ever innocent but that like last year I didn't have to worry about working, college, scholarships, where i'm going to go.... 
My friends are going through a lot. I'm there for them but I don't know if they want me to be there for them. I try to talk to my friends, like I was telling one of them about all this crap that happened last night but I felt like... they didn't understand. Maybe because they didn't? They don't know a lot. I wish all of my friends knew everything that happens in my life. The thing is though that most of my friends don't really know me at all. I'll talk to them a lot or tell them things but it's bullshit. I love them so much. Maybe that's what scares me. I don't want to love them. I don't want to love them and something happen. Something happen to one of them or one of them leave. But I don't even know when something happens because they don't tell me so that I can try to be there for them. 
I want to change so much. I wish I was... different. I was going to say something about changing physically but Lee would have killed me, lol. That's one of my main problems though. I can't stand it. 
He drives me crazy. Up a fucking wall. Maybe one person knows who I'm talking about. And no, it's not the one that most of my friends would assume i'm talking about. I've had to let go of that. I miss the way things were with him though. Tweet. I just couldn't continue to hold onto the dream of him. Everything about now and later was just so cloudy. I didn't know anything. I miss the love that I felt for him. What I felt was love at the time. When I think about how I felt about him, it makes me happy though. I don't want to look at the bad of the situation. All the pain it caused me. I want to remember all the good stuff and just miss it all. I just hope that he'll have an awesome life and if something is meant to be with him, I'm sure fate can work it out that we'll run into each other later on. 
In the meantime though, the other him.... ::sigh:: Guys are just insane. So am I though, so I guess it works out. I hate that he trys to make me jealous because he khows that I pay attention and that I get jealous. But I can't talk because I've been trying to do the same to him. I love how things were the last time. lol... I know that there's something there and it pisses me off that he won't take charge of it. Take control... courage. I don't know why. 
I need to lose weight or something. Not for him. Because I can't stand it anymore. I'm so bipolar when it comes to this. Somedays I'm perfectly fine, I think I'm perfectly fine. Other days though I feel like i'm utterly disgusting. Aisha was saying how she's been trying to drill into her head ""I am pretty, nice smile, smart, funny, etc."" I've tried to do that too, to make myself believe that i'm ok. Pleh, I don't think it's worked. It'll work with Aisha because she's finally realizing the truth about herself. Me, it's more like I was trying to convince myself. I told my mom that I think God must like me or something, who knows why. But I was saying he must like me because I have so many great things in my life that I don't think I deserve. I wish I could do so much for my friends. Bring back everything, whatever they want. Help them. I don't think I deserve the friends that I have or to have such a good mom. I mean, we have no money. We weren't going to be able to eat for two weeks but my mom went to the store and wrote a bad check so we could have food. She breaks her back at work, literally. She needs to go to the doctor's again. And then the whole thing with Gavin last night, him telling her that she's a bitch that's going to fucking hell. He's so self-absorbed. My mom has spoiled every single one of us. He doesn't realize everything that she's done for us throughout the years. Gavin almost beat the shit out of me three times last night but I wouldn't put up with it. I've put up with it my entire childhood, whatever childhood I did have. 
There's just so much crap. That's not even the tip of the iceberg. How fucking pathetic is it that I want him to know all this? I want him to know everything. I want him to just hold me, be next to me. I want my friends to know this, but again it'd be just bullshit. Who cares about what I went through? It's nothing compared to everything my friends and everyone else has been through. I don't tell my freinds a lot because I don't want them to view me differently. I don't want them to look at me differently. There's so much that has gone on and is going on and I just go through everyday life like everything's fine. It's amazing how the next day comes no matter what. The sun still rises and sets. 
Anyways, I got my phone back. Well, not my phone but my phone number. My mom found an old phone that she had a couple years ago and we went to Verizon before I went to work today and got her number switched off her slider phone that i've been using and put onto her old phone and got my number put onto her slider phone. So, w00t. I have a phone again. I was so stupid to have misplaced it. Oh well, shit happens. I can't change that I lost it. Unless I had a time machine. That would be awesome. I need to decide if I'm going to school tomorrow or not. I have stuff that I could get done. If I don't go then I can go to work early tomorrow and get some more hours. This is my last week of being able to work because basektball season starts next week. Not that i'm going to make the team, but still.... I really wish that I could do the school musical but it's right during basketball season. If I can't do the musical though, I'm going to try to do the One Acts in the spring. I talked to Mr. Owen and he wants me to do them So, we'll see... Do you know what sucks? I told my mom that if I didn't make the team I didn't think I'd even be a manager. I don't think I could handle another whole year of watching other girls play and dying to be out on the court myself. I love basketball so much, I don't know why. It makes me feel.... ok. Like everything is ok, or just that everything doesn't matter. I feel better when I'm playing... I feel complete almost. It's weird that something can have such an influence on you. If I don't make the school team though, I've already talked to Crystal's Dad (one of last year's varsity players) and I've met with him. He's met with AAU and put together an outside team and I'm going to play with them. 
Mom is made at me. I had to work from 6-9:30 tonight and when I got home I didn't feel like eating dinner. I changed, relaxed for a minute and went running. I had two bowls of cereal before I went to work, my goodness. I'll survive if I don't have an actual ""dinner."" She just gave me a truffle though, it was really good. I wasn't going to eat it, but I think she would have forced me too. It was a white chocolate truffle and thoroughly enjoyable, lol. I need to finish getting all of my application stuff for college organized. It sucks that I got accepted to a school out of state already and I'm not going. USC in California is still bugging me to apply and UPenn is trying to get me to apply there too. I don't think I'm going to even bother to apply though... I'd just rather stay in Florida and go to UCF or something. 
I should probably get to bed. I don't know if i'm going to school tomorrow. I'm thinking strongly against it at the moment. I was really sick on Wednesday and could use a day to just cool off. How can it be that sometimes i'm so extraordinarily happy and ok with things and then something will happen (or not happen rather) and it's like ""damn, this sucks..."" ? Most of it has to do with work... ::shrug::
I got to talk to Lee today, which was good... i'd say. I wanted her to get a lot out and she said she felt better. She didn't tell me anything that I hadn't already guessed about though. I just hope that she's ok... with me. I wouldn't want to lose her as a friend. I hope that she's ok. I hope Aisha's ok too. I think Aisha's doing great, she's amazing so she'll be fine no matter what. Missy, I miss you. I wish I didn't work this weekend. I'll have like every friday off starting next week so maybe you can come over and chill? I don't go into until like 3 on saturdays. We'll have to see. Ok, yah... I'm wrapping all this up. That was a long ramble, didn't realize that I had that much to say. I think it also had to do with that I haven't updated in ages and rarely have time to. I shouldn't have spent this long to type all this as it is. All is done. I'll see you all when I see you.

I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you.
I break the yolks, make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
Never put wet towels on the floor anymore' cause
Dreams last for so long
even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy and I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.
I go about my business, I'm doin fine
Besides what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday.
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up. Turn the sheets down.
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pjs and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon I know you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

Yeah.... You were meant for me and I was meant for you."

"event","Last week my parents were off and Missy came over to spend a few days. She spent like 5 actually, w00t. ^.~ On Monday and Tuesday we had to wake up early because we went to Jetty Park Monday and then to Wekiva Springs on Tuesday. Jetty Park was really nice, the side of the beach that we were on was a lot nicer than where we usually go. We collected like a shiz load of shells, lol. We're trying to put together a Summer of 2005 Souvenir Collection. Because also, when we went to Wekiva there were a bunch of rocks on the bottom of the spring and we put together a rock collection. Wekiva was a lot better than Jetty Park, I think. But the water was insanely colder. The first time we went in, I didn't want to just jump in like Missy and Gavin so I asked Missy to put her knees up so I could use them as a stepping stool-thingy. We had barbecue at both places. Awesome times, but Tuesday was so funny. 

On the car ride home, Missy and I were so tired we were really out of it. We were all talking about Gavin and went to say things he shouldn't do and my Mom was like ""Yeah! Like with you cussing because it's not nice."" Then I went to say something and say ""Yeah! Like with you cursing because...."" They all got a kick out of that and I was trying to explain that I was going to say something else but then I got stuck on what my Mom said and was thinking about cursing in my head so that's what came out. And plus, because my Mom says cussing, I say cursing. ::shrug:: I think the best thing though was when I looked over and saw a place called HeatherWood and I said ""HeatherWood!"" Then Missy looked up and went to say something but I finished ""That's where I should live..."" She looks around and goes ""Oh!"" LOL. She tells me that after I said HeatherWood she was about to say ""You would what?"" She thought I was speaking in third person and my parents were talking about doing something and I was like ""Heather would!"" My gosh, that was so hysterical. 

I think those were the best parts. Oh! Except when we went canoeing. LOL, because you can fit at most 3 to a boat so Gavin and Rich shared a boat and then my Mom, Missy, and I. Missy sat in the middle to help balance it and then my Mom sat in the back and me in the front. It took us a while to learn how to work together to keep the boat going and to make it go in the direction that we wanted to keep us from running into tree and bushes sticking out over the waterside. Before we did though, we ran into a couple....ok, a few...bunches of trees and bushes. Normally though, we could stop ourselves in time. But this one time, we were going to fast and the entire front 1/3 of the boat ran into a bush. I knew we couldn't stop in time so before we hit it, or as we hit it, I flung myself backwards so that I was laying flat in the boat. My Mom paddled backwards to get us out. I was still laying flat when Missy was like ""Heather! There's a huge spider on you!!"" It was originally on my chest and scampered it's way to my left shoulder where I flicked it off. Ok, so by then we were like ""All right, we're good to go."" And balanced the boat so that I could sit back up on the little seat thing. I got up and situated myself and Missy screams again that there was a massive spider under the seat. I mean! This sucker was huge and I screamed and put my feet up on the top of the boat to keep my legs away from it. Rich and Gavin had to come back to get rid of it. lol, when we saw the spider my Mom was just like ""Heather! Don't freak out! Because if we tip over, that's it!!"" LOL. 

There was a little wooden dock about 2 or 3 miles out with a huge green opening. We stopped to rest, drink some Caprisuns, and take some pictures. Gavin really had to use the bathroom though, and he couldn't hold it. So, there was a little forest area and he went and hid in a bush to use the bathroom, it was so funny. He was so scared that we would see him, we thought he walked like a mile into the forest because he was no where to be seen or heard until we saw him walk out of a clearing. But anyways, so we carefully got back in the canoes and went back. We did a lot better this time. At one spot we saw a baby crocodile up on a log by the side of the river. We saw it run out of the water when we passed before and Gavin freaked out. He was like ""I thought you said there were no alligators in this river!!!"" It's a river, Gavin. Come on! LOL. Then we got back and went into the spring for a little bit, had barbecue, went swimming again, got our rocks, and drove home to HeatherWood. lol, kidding. Mucho fun, though.

Missy stayed until Friday and Thursday night we went to the movies to go see Batman Begins because Gavin was dieing to see it again and Missy, my Mom, and Rich hadn't seen it. It was good. There were these two cute guys at the counter that were flirting. When we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the movie to start, I was like ""I have to use the bathroom, be right back."" So I got up to go and Missy got up to come with me and then Rich says ""Hey Heather, I want their names and phone numbers."" lol. When we were leaving from our theatre, we saw them setting up for Fantastic 4 because it was like 12:30am. I can't wait to go see that. I heard it was good.

So that was the week so far, and then Friday I went home with Missy because we had a meeting on Saturday. I hadn't been to her house in a while and I forgot how much I miss it there and how awesome her Mom is. Missy tried to teach me some of next year's dance routine and it's really twisty-turny and she got a headache. It was so funny, because I was too tired so I kept struggling with this one turn. But all is well, I'll figure it out. My Mom picked me up Sunday afternoon after taking Gavin to work. Missy and her Mom were mad that I was leaving, but I kinda had to. I put up with Missy for a whole week, what more could you ask for? LOL. Kidding, ^.~. Missy, I love you! And plus, Sunday was the last day/night of my Mom and Rich's vacation. Oh! While I was at Missy's they went to go see Mr. and Mrs. Smith and they loved it too. Said it was really good. I can't wait to get that movie on DVD and the soundtrack. Awesomeness. I bought the movie Hitch yesterday with Will Smith. Really funny movie, that was a good one too. 

Today is July 14!!! It's Missy's birthday, yay! Big w00ts! They are going to Kobe tonight for her birthday and Missy wants me to go but I don't like people spending money on me. I want to go, though and Missy would probably rip out my insides if I didn't go, lol. I also get my schedule today from Publix which I'm hoping that I don't work tomorrow (Friday) because we have another meeting and everyone else can go so it's just up to me! I don't doubt that I'll be able to make it. The meeting is in the morning anyways and I'll probably be working in the evening. Everything should work out. ::crosses fingers::

Oh, yeah! So the stupid people in the title. That's talking about Gavin which leads to why I'm wake at 6 in the morning. He went out with this new friend, John last night like around 9pm. And my Mom didn't want to let him go in the first place, but her and Rich decided to let him go and just told them to be back around 1am or to atleast give them a call. Rich talked to John and everything and John said he had a cellphone and he had Rich's cell number and he said he'd call. But it's like almost 2am and no call, from either John or Gavin. So Rich gets the phone to try to call, but of course no one answers. Then, my Mom wakes me up around 5:30am/6am to help her find her keys and she's like ""Have you heard from Gavin or did he call your cell or anything?"" And I was like ""Noooo....He's not back yet?!"" Rich tried to call them again this morning and said that Gavin's phone was just off now completely. So, of course now I can't sleep. Because people are stupid and I'm worrying about my annoying brother. I don't know...Yeah, he's 18 but he still lives here and should have some kind of respect for my Mom and us and this house to let us know where he is and that he's ok...

I just hope that he's ok and that everything works out ok because it's Missy birthday and I'm suppose to go out with them later today and I'm not going to be able to do that worrying about Gavin. And I hope that stupid lady from Publix calls me to let me know what my schedule is and the results on my drug test. My manager Jeff said that she would call me. I even called on Tuesday to check up on things and she said not to worry about, she'd call me on Thursday. So, today's Thursday. The 14th. Missy's birthday. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory comes out tomorrow. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince comes out in two days on the 16th. w00t. I'm very excited about that. All right, well I think I'll go find something to do, or read, or clean. I need to clean the house so that when Gavin gets home and I kill him it won't be as big of a mess...."

""Rumors Of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated""

...so please don't ask me how
i ended up at my wits end and breaking down.
pages torn from books we never read,
cause we're plugged into this grid.
don't pull this plug right now,
or then we really have to live.

when i die, will they remember not
what i did, but what i haven't done.
it's not the end, that i fear with each breathe.
it's life that scares me to death...

when we built these dreams on sand,
how they all slipped through our hands.
and this might be our only chance.
let's take this one day at a time,
i'll hold your hand if you hold mine.
the time that we kill keeps us alive.

your words won't save me now.
i'm at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow.
get a grip on yourself is what they say,
every hour every day.
hands over my ears,
I'VE BEEN SCREAMING ALL THESE YEARS!

when i die, will they remember not
what i did, but what i haven't done.
it's not the end, that i fear with each breathe.
it's life that scares me to death...

when we built these dreams on sand,
how they all slipped through our hands.
and this might be our only chance.
let's take this one day at a time,
i'll hold your hand if you hold mine.
the time that we kill keeps us alive.

WE CAME IN SEARCH OF ANSWERS!
WE LEFT EMPTY HANDED AGAIN!
SHOTS FIRED INTO THE SKY...
ARE NOW RETURNING!
WHERE THE FUCK WILL YOU HIDE!
from the laughter in the closet, some alive 
but the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light.
and now our hands extending outward,
quiet comfort they invite,
and do we dare take what they offer?
do we step into the light?

when i die, will they remember not
what i did, but what i haven't done.
it's not the end, that i fear with each breathe.
it's life that scares me to death...

"event","Ok, were did I leave off before? After me and Lee got done watching Charmed, we got ready for IOA, and went ahead and left for Universal. We got a Casey Sub for lunch before we went though. 

It was a mucho awesome day. Oh, if you read Lee's journal, the majorly wrong thing that Patty did was he grabbed my boobs during the Dudley doo Right ride. I was like ""Keep your hands to yourself!"" And didn't talk to him the rest of the time. Oh well, I was like whatever. Josh was awesome and me and Lee just talked to him. But we ditched them after the Flying Unicorn and rode Dueling Dragons and everything was awesomeness again. We rode on the front of Fire Dragon, and it was the frickin' shit!! I was uber scared at first but then it was a lot of fun. I wasn't as scared when we rode up front for the Hulk, but that was because the guy was really funny! He was making us laugh because he was like ""Let's Go!"" and was chanting with a bunch of people ""We ready, we ready, we ready"" It was coolio. 

Kenny Loggins was the shit. One guy actually screamed that too. He was like ""Kenny, you're the shit!!"" But Kenny Loggin's voice just blew me away. Me and Lee were clinging to each other for warmth and we got all sad for a couple of the songs. After that we went to go get something to eat, because all we had had to eat since the CaseySubs was some dippin dots. So, we went to Red Lobster which was delicously awesome. Oh, and I played this little basketball shooting game thing and won a whitetiger. It was fun. 

After I got home, I talked to my mom and Rich then passed out on my bed. I'm talking to Lee right now. She's crazy, her laugh is like ""kabaam!"" LOL. Mucho funny. We're both watching one of the most awesome movies ever! Ever After!! lol. Ok, I'll update again later.

"event","These past two days have been the most awesomeness. Yesterday, well Friday, I went to a basketball meeting with Coach and the girls, then Lee and I hung out with her sister and went to Wal-Mart. Afer that, we got dropped off at Lee's house and we drove to Alyssa's to go to the musical. Alyssa's mom came with, she's great, and Janelle was there too. Aisha went as well, she met us at the play and she looked like the frickin' shiz'nizzie!!! She was all shnazzed up in a dress and make-up, everything. She looked awesome. The play itself was the best too. Carl was beautiful and Andre was really funny. It had some awesomely funny parts in it. I had such a blast with everyone. 
After the play, I went home with Lee. We stayed up for a little while, ate cantelope, checked mail, went to sleep. Oooohh, sleep sounds nice right now. lol. 

We woke up at frickin' 7:30 in the bloody a.m.!! I was uber shocked. But Mom made french toast and cinnamon rolls and then we watched the new Charmed. And i'm totally going to have to finish this later because i'm so tired. Mucho Hugs,

"event","My past week has been craaaaazzzyyy, lol. School has been ok, the constant work being pounded on me, but i'm use to it. I have to wake up insanely early tomorrow to make up a test that i missed Friday. >< 

My Prom was awesome. My mom got mad and upset at me and I was all crying when I got home though. Because I got home at 3 in the morning on Friday after helping set up, then I had to wake up early to go back and help again. I had Micah pick me up and take me to the hotel with her just because I thought it'd be easier on my mom instead of having to wake up and take me. Then because it took so long, I didn't get home Saturday until 7pm, so I only had like a hour and some odd minutes to get ready. Anyways, my mom was upset just cos she took the day off to be there for me and do for me. Then I got Micah to take me to the hotel in the morning and drive me home and my mom had said she would take me and pick me up. Then she thought i'd get home earlier so we would have a bunch of time to do my hair, make-up, and get ready and everything but I got home so late. I just felt bad because I made a stupid decision and had Micah drive me just cos she lives so close. And anyone who knows my mom and Rich, you know how they are with driving, and I was just trying to be considerate. Whatever, so...I was crying a lot and my mom was telling me to stop crying or my face would be red when I got to prom. I stopped, and I started to get ready and my mom did my hair and the whole thing was all over with. ::shrug:: 

We left to pick up Janelle and we were both all excited on the way there. Me and Janelle had the same kind of gloves, we were both like ""wooo!"" lol. We got to Prom, had a little trouble getting in, but everything turned out ok. Nik and Lee were waiting for us, so we took bunch of pictures, danced, talked, all that jazz. Afterwards we went to Steak 'N' Shake, which was the highlight of the evening, very hilarious. Us and our crazy conversations. I was worried about Janelle getting in trouble, but everything turned out fine there too. I was also worried about Lee because I remembered that she had to go into work early the next day, but she said she was ok even though work was slow and she only got 3 hours of sleep.

Today was an awesome day though, many thanks to Lee, ^.~. It would of just been an ok day, but Micah insisted on driving us home so we wouldn't have to walk on such a hot day so Lee just came home with me so that we could hang out. We talked a lot which is always fun with Lee, us and our deep and meaningful conversations. Woot to Rei and Ian convos, lol. Then we got something to eat, well actually the eating came before the Rei and Ian talk, but oh well lol. Then she helped me with Chemistry labs I had to make up from missing school Friday due to Prom stuff, and we worked on my SGA posters a little bit. One phrase that Lee made up that i'm going to have to make sure to use is ""It'd be nice to be vice, Vote Heather Comas for your Student Government Vice President."" LOL. Right about then, Lee's mom picked her up. But it's not over!!! Duuuunnnn duuun duuuuuuuuuuun! lol, Because we're going to our school play on Friday night, then on Saturday we're going to use our benefits for IOA and Mardi Gras. Mucho fun there.

I'm wondering if I should do a Rei update..... I don't think so, cos Lee you already know everything and I don't feel like sitting here typing more. I have a lot of homework to do, which is what I should be doing now. The update would just be about Rei being his continuous crazy self, funny funny, and really cute butt! lol ^^ I got a good look at it today ^.~

Work has been ok too. I felt really bad because I called in on Tuesday and Friday but I had Prom stuff to do, and school/SGA is a higher priority than my job. I need to figure out what day is my next day to go in and work. I need money even though I don't want to work too much. When I read your journal Lee, I saw that you were listening to Journey, so I started to listen to some, and now i'm all in a Rei mood. Not a bad-sad (lol) one though, a good-contemplative one.... Oh! I have to remember to tell you something that Gavin (<---notice the spelling ^.~) told me after you left, it was really funny and it made me laugh. You'll laugh too. Ok, homework time now...mucho fun, and much love my pets, lol,
~Heather."

"event","Greetings everyone, 

It has been a long, long, long time since I have updated. I could have been dead, and no one would know! >>; (kidding) Anyways, I guess everything is going ok. I'm glad to hear that you are all doing good. There have been several major incidents in my life since the last time I updated.

1. Rei and I are friends again now. We talk almost everyday in 6th period. Woohoo. ^^ lol. 
2. My grades are doing good, I guess. I just got a 80% on my last Algebra test. Overall I think I have 4 A's and 2 B's? It might be one B. ::shrug:: 
3. I'm not sure how long Rich and my mom will be together. Not because of issues between them, but because Rich might be forced to leave. It's a really long story, for those who know, yippee for you. Those who don't and are concerned, just know that I'm ok and things will turn out how they are meant to.
4. I got a new backpack and a new wallet (it's black and pink with a frog on it ><) lol.
5. Cole from Charmed is extremely hot. And Viggo is fabulous. 
6. I am currently being stalked by some psycho who I met once at night school. He calls me at least 3-5 times a day. I am dangerously close to giving him the ""Rejection Hotline"" number. Have you all heard it? It's hilarious! One of the numbers is (407)338-0036. Enjoy.
7. Nik is still calling me, bugging me about finding a time to come over so he can reclaim his belongings. I actually picked up one time and then he started apologizing for irritatingly texting and calling me. ::shrug:: I don't know...

I think that's it...I'll stop at seven! ^.~ 
I hope you all continue to do well in all of your endeavors. Much love <3 <3 <3

~Heather

Sh. <----Few will understand."

--I have all A's and one B: That was hell to pull off...I've barely been eating and   sleeping. 
--Between school, basketball practice, exercise, SGA and trying to spend time with friends and family, I have not watched ""One Tree Hill"" in over one month. (I know, I'm ashamed v.v;)
--Psychology project is almost done. My group is finishing it tomorrow.
--I have to read Chs. 8-13 for a unit test on Monday for AP US History.
--Rei is driving me crazy with his constant constantness...(Missy will understand that, lol)
--I miss you guys so much. ;-;

"event","I have not wrote in my livejournal in over a month. I am incredibly sorry. I've been so busy, it's very hard to describe. I barely come online anymore, much less have time to sit down and write in my livejournal. Anyways, at the moment I am in a terrible mood. Well no, not mood...more like state. I have a really bad cold, i'm cramping, and I am indescribably sore from basketball practice. Sorry, conditioning, not practice. Tryouts are on November the 1st. ::crosses fingers:: 

Conditioning has been really hard though. The first day I went, I literally threw up... ><; I probably wouldn't have if I had had something to eat earlier that day. v.v; It is so hard. We're in the weight room for a hour each day, then we run almost everyday, at least a mile. We do sprinting, stadiums, bear (or patriot) miles, and then we go in the gym. We do 6 laps around the gym, sprinting with the ball...Then we do something called ""21,"" were one person rebounds the ball and another person has to shoot the ball and try to get more hits than misses in 2 minutes. After that, we do leg throw-downs (I won't describe them, but just tell you guys that you never want to experience the pain of leg throw-downs in your life), then play scrimage. The loosing team has to do laps of sprinting. Each time we've done scrimage, i've been on the loosing team, and we lost by 4 points, so we had to do 8 laps of sprinting. ><; I've gotten a lot better though from when I first started conditioning. It is worth the pain. The insufferable pain, lol. I've lost another 4lbs. I'm hoping i'll make JV. I know I most likely will not make Varsity, mostly just seniors are on Varsity. 

School wise, things have been going good. We get report cards next week, and i'm a little irritated because i'm going to have 3 B's on it. I don't know...I haven't been concentrating on school as much. Between basketball, SGA, friends, family, and Nik, I barely have anytime. And what time I do have, i'm in too much physical pain to use my brain. lol. Oh that's right, I never told you guys about Nik. He's my boyfriend...>>; We've been dating for a little over 3 weeks now. He's really great, and he cares about me a lot. It's going good. ::shrug:: We'll have to see how things turn out...


My mom's doing good. Her knee's a lot better. She's not in much pain anymore. Her and Rich still hate their jobs. They're going out to look for a new car tomorrow...

I took the PSAT. I got a 1650. Which I guess isn't bad, but I want it to be higher. The SAT should be fun. Woohoo, college. It's scary to think about all of us at that age. After we graduate...... I can't decide whether this year is going by fast or slow. At the beginning of the week, it'll be Tuesday and I'm just like ""wow, it's only Tuesday...this week is going by so slow!"" But then it's Friday and I'm like ""wow, the week flew by..."" 

I guess I'm going to have to get use to having a couple of B's on my report card... I mean, just with basketball season about to start and everything, I can't devote every second of my time to doing homework, studying, everything like that anymore. B's are ok though, I guess. But I hate them. Like I have a B in my AP History class. But it is an AP class, and a B is a good thing in that class. An AP class is weighted heavier than a honors class. So... ::shrug::

I think that is it for now. I promise I'll try to update more often. Definitely to let you guys know how try-outs went. ^.~ I miss you all so much...Mon cher, I hope you're doing ok...Try no to stress so much, and remember I love you and miss you. I love you all very much... Try to have fun you guys, we're still only 16 years old... Enjoy as much of high school as you can. Bye ^.^

Love,
The Flc."

"event","Well, I survived Frances. Not like she was bad enough for me to say ""Woohoo! I survived!"" lol. It was just windy and rained non-stop for like two days. I don't believe that anyone in Orlando lost power... I was trying to watch the news to hear about Ivan, and one of the news anchors came on and says: ""We have recent information about Ivan, but Governor Bush doesn't want us mentioning anything about Hurricane Ivan just yet."" I literally just stared at the television. I was like ""Oh please, come on. People need to know whether they should leave their windows boarded up or not!"" LOL. 

Yes, school got canceled for today. I was excited about it in a sense of I haven't been sleeping too well, so I needed the extra sleep. I hope they don't cancel school on Wednesday though. I need to see my people! xD. I got most of my homework done, just that dreadful Prefix Sheet for English. And I need to study some more for History. Nothing too big. 

What else was there? Hmmmm...I need to pee, but that's besides the point. ^.~ I feel kinda blah today, I don't know why. I weighed myself a couple weeks ago at Publix, and it said that I've lost 14 pounds. Well it didn't actually say ""Heather, you've lost fourteen pounds."" lol. So, everyone was like ""oh that's good."" But to me it's like ""that's it?!"" It is a start however, just have to keep working at it. I think it seems like so little to me, because 1-it's my body, so I don't notice a difference and 2-it's taken like 5 months to loose 14 pounds. The thing is though, is cos I'm taking it very slowly. I exercise when I feel like it, and I watch what I eat but I don't starve myself. Like, if I feel like having some cake, or ice cream, or a brownie once in a while, I'll have one. So, le sigh. 

That's about it for now. Love you all, and I'm extremely glad that you're all doing fine. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 ^.~

Yesterday was fun. I had heard about the Drama Club meeting and was looking forward to it. I asked Missy if she wanted to go with me, which she did, so we went together. All of us, lol. Me, Missy, Alyssa, Jessie, and Janelle. It was interesting and should be a rather entertaining year. I was very excited. Nick went to the meeting too, and he gave us all a ride home. 

Tomorrow is gonna be a little difficult. I have a SGA meeting and a basketball meeting at the same time. Well not exactly at the same time, but they overlap. I'll have to go to Mrs. Baker's room (Head of SGA) and tell her I have to go to a basketball meeting for a while. It should work out fine. Then there's a football game tomorrow, which I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'd like to, seeing as our team is doing A LOT better this year. Another thing I'm excited about. Because then all of our teams will be better. 

I'll update more later. Love you guys, Mon cher, Anchovy, Carissa... Miss ya.

The day I go back to school will be one of ineffable joy. One I'll get to see everyone again. Especially Tony, and Missy. I haven't got to see Missy at all, or Tony since Thursday. And I rarely talk to Missy cos she has family and everything over. Two, I'll be given stuff to do. I always finish school work so quickly. So when I have so little, I run out of assignments to do.

On the other hand, going back will be a bad thing. One, it means dealing with teachers and stuff. However, I actually have decent teachers this year. The past couple of years, I have gotten lucky. Two, everything with tryouts, sports, and meetings are going to be messed up. Just with us loosing a week of school. Somehow though, I can imagine that they'll make it up. We'll get other vacation days revoked or something.

I believe that we have Labor Day stil off. Hopefully. So I think that gives us a three day weekend. Mon cher, we should all get together and do something. ((Cos I miss you too, very much.)) Something, anything...besides just going to the mall. ^.~ Maybe we could go ice skating again. XD. That'd be a blast. 

Love,
The Flc

"event","I should be off cleaning, which I promise I am about to go do. Wednesday and Thursday were SOOO much fun. I went to Tony's with Gavin and we spent the night. Gavin was already at Tony's, so Gavin, Tony, and Yolimar (Tony's sister) rode half way to meet me. Gavin and Yoli took their bikes, and Tony rode his rollerblades. They left before me and since I took my rollerblades, which I haven't rode in forever, they got to the half way mark before I did. So, Tony ended up going further to meet me and he helped me along so I wouldn't fall and bust my ass. XDD. We got drinks at 7 Eleven, and Gavin and I switched. Meaning, I took his sneakers and bike, and he took the rollerblades...

Tony knew a short cut to his house, which we ended up taking. He lives too damn far away. I want him to live close enough so that we could go to his house whenever we feel like it. ><. Anyways, the shortcut ended up being a nice little swampie thingie because of the rain. Normally it's dry sand and grass. Thankfully, the water only went to our knees. Yoli had flip flops on which wasn't good. And since I had on sneakers, we ended up getting bug bites which itched to all hell. 

Since we were all dirty and felt nasty, when we got to his house we all took showers. Not together... >>; ^.~ I took mine first and I hadn't brought clothes to change into seeing as us staying was a spur of the moment thing, so Gavin didn't have clothes either. But I borrowed boxers, shorts, and a shirt from Tony. Boxers feel so nice might I add. But Gavin free-balled it. At first Tony kidded around, saying ""Heather-Feather, you're just going to have to free-coochie it."" xD. 

We had pizza for dinner, then watched Scary Movie. We were so stupid and laughed so hard. Then we just hung out. Jessica was with us (another of Tony's sister). Which, Mon cher I wish you were there. You would of had such a blast with us. You need to come over some time to meet Tony. You guys would get along great and it would just add to the hysteria. ^.~ 

Well, when we got home yesterday Mom was kinda mad because we had called so late to see if we could stay. To sum up, I really shouldn't be on the computer. Which is why I said I should be off cleaning- damage control ^.^. I don't think Mom cared that much really, I think she's just been very edgy, tempermental, and stressed with a bunch of work related crap. Anyways, things will be fine. The thing that sucks was that Tony was suppose to come over on Saturday, and now I'm not sure if he'll be able to... 

Mon cher, I want to pet the squirrelly. LOL. I saw the piccie that Anchovy put up of Charley and he looks adorable. I hope he's doing better, he sounds like it. Alrightie, I miss you very much mon cher and I love you dearly. Hugs to everyone I love!

Forever,
~The Fleether~

P.S: I can't wait for school to start back. I'm beginning to miss everyone else."

"event","I didn't get to rant about my classes last time because I was being all quixotic about Rei. Anyways! I love all my classes. Well, except like one, lol. Here is the le schedular...(chronological order)

--Chemistry Honors: Like Missy, I have Mrs. Branch. Who, is not a bad lady, just rather blah. But I still love the class because my Lee is in it and we make each other laugh till it hurts. Lee reminds me of Mon cher. ^.~
--Algebra 2: This is the one class i'm sketchy about. Like I had said last time, just cos it's a regular class. Having just ONE regular class is gonna drive me insane. It's such a bore and it's too easy. I LOVE the teacher though, Ms. Mir. She's such a blast, and I knew her last year. Not cos I had her, but cos some of my friends had here and we'd hang out and see her after school.
--Psychology: Very philosophical, lol. I have Ms. Peachey, or Mrs. Brockett as she prefers. She's very sweet and kinda corky. But then again, she is a psychology major...
--English 3 Honors: Lovely class, I know so many people. Aisha, Missy, Vicky, Jesse, Chris, Tiffany, Yesenia...Buncha people. And Mrs. Newberry seems strict but fun. And it's my lunch period. I luuuuv it. xD
--LUNCH: Just thought I'd stick this in here. Lunch is a blast too. Lee is in my lunch along with Aisha, Missy, and Jessie. It sounds like it'd be great that I have Missy in my lunch, but I don't get to talk to her at all. Mostly because she clings on Jessie wherever she goes. ^.~
--AP US History: Oh my goodness! I love this class. It is so much fun. I love learning, and Mr. Bennett is so a contemplative man, so his lectures are abetting. 
--Spanish 2: What can I say, need it for scholarships... Urghbarh, lol. Senora James is really sweet and funny. She likes to tell stories, but they are not boring or drag on like some teacher's stories. She's great. I had said last that Michael was in that class with me, which is why that one day I was so blah. Oh well, ya have to take the good with the bad. Move on.

So, sequitur: this year should be interesting. Very busy and jading, yet full of hilarity. ::le sigh:: For example, i'm exhausted right now. LOL. So, I shall talk to ya'll laters. Love and big hugs,

The Flc."

"event","Twas rather funny... This girl named PixieGurl253 IMed Missy the other day. We didn't know who she was, so we said ""Should I know you?"" And she replied ""I'm Lizzy, and I always forget who you are..."" So we asked her were she knew Malyssa from to try to jog Missy's memory. PixieGurl253 answered: ""I don't know you"" ::chuckles:: Then we said ""Well then why bother IMing me then, bye. Have a nice life."" PixieGurl253 replied: ""..."" LOL. We were cracking up with laughter. Oh, and I got my period yesterday so I did't feel too well. It was like cramp central. I took some Midol, which took like a half hour to kick in. So I curled up on the bed with a pillow to my stomach (Mom advised me on doing so). I feel somewhat better today though, besides that I'm still menstral. Missy is pissing me off cos she keeps reading everything outloud with Jessi and Anchovy sitting right here. xD. And I believe Lynnie-Booh is here, so we can go pick up Carrey for the meeting. Love ya.

P.S: Plus side of getting my period yesterday, I won't have it for AFO5 or for the start of school. Awesome! Cos now I can have a blast without worrying about ""Have I leak?!"" ^.~"

"event","I'm currently talking on the phone with Missy, and I have no energy so i'm gettin' alittle tipsy! Hyper, hahahaaaa. Patooie...Missy just said patooie, whatever that means. I hate exercising, cos it increases your metabolic rate and your body needs more fuel. SO! You need to eat more, but I don't want to eat MORE, i've been trying to cut back how much I eat. It's a rather confusing subject. She doesn't even remember saying patooie. That's going to be my word. Missy says it's like when you spit, ""Patooie!"" LOL!!! I'm suppose to be going to her house tomorrow cos Joanie is gonna try to go over to get practice for our cosplay. So, Missy wants me to go over and help out and just to go over to be there. She's brain farted at the moment. She's trying to explain something and she's all ""sorry, i'm brain farted at the moment..."" xD. I can't wait to do more Morning Musume cosplays, and spend time with all the girls. It'll be a blast... I want to take a shower cos I went for my nightly run and sweated. I need to wash it all off and change my clothes. I need to get off the phone with Missy first though.... >>; LOL. Well that's it for now, baibais my fellow human beings... ::snicker snicker:: xD"

"event","Let's see....what happened today? Woke up at like 9:40am to get dressed to go to Missy's for the Mocking Musume meeting. Got there to find Carissa was the only one there, and Jessi and Anchovy couldn't make it on account of that they didn't have a ride. Which is ok, we understand things happen. Then I call Joanie's to find out she's not feeling well from work and stress and what not. Which is ok, we understand things happen. ^.~ lol. But, ::shrug::. We just looked at a bunch of Morning Musume videos and Missy and I googled over how much fun it's gonna be. We tried to watch Azumanga Daio, but the compie kept lagging so we passed out....for like 2 hours. Then my mommi picked me up around 7:30 when it was pouring out. Had Steak 'N' Shake for dinner. Jessica and Steph picked Gavin and me up around 10:30 pm. We rode to Tony's house (Gavin's ""boyfriend"".... kinda). He lives in the Vistas, which is a rather nice neighborhood. Jessica turned into the wrong Vistas, Sierra, and we drove around there for like 10 minutes before we finally got out. Then we went to the right one, and called Tony to get him outside. We snuck inside, but we couldn't go through the front door. So, Stephanie and I helped pop out his screen, LOL. We were there for about a hour, then we left. It was SOOOO hilarious, a blast. Basically my day, nothing big. It was a rather ""blah"" day. Oh, school starts in like two weeks. And even worse, AFO starts in less than two weeks. It's going to be really fun, but we need practice. School'll be fun too. I actually can't WAIT to get back and see everyone. AHHH! Juniors! LOL. Love and Peace! ^.~"

You constantly have things thrown in your face, if not that, you don't have anything at all. All life is, is pain...It's almost like a test. Like everything that happens and everything you feel and are faced with is to test you. To test how you react, or how you feel. There are so many people in this world with so much pain. It's undescribeable... Some of them probably don't even know why they hurt. I guess, what I'm trying to say is that it's impossible to analyze everything that goes on in your life. You have to deal with it, then move on. 'Cause if you dwell on every little thing, you won't have a life at all...I don't know...I'm in a weird mood...>>;"

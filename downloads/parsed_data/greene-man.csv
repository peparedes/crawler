He was with the Corps of Engineers and served with the famous 77th &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; Division which was composed mostly of men from New York City. Grandpa never talked about the war to me before he died in 1980 at the age of 84, but I heard some fairly bleak second-hand tales from my father. He always called Veteran&#39;s Day by its original name, Armistice Day.</p><p>Dad served in the Army stateside from January 1944 through the middle of 1946. He was was an artilleryman, and according to his service documents (which I have) was trained as a forward observer (flash range finder) and a gun tractor driver. His unit was used to train other units. Dad later claimed that he was meant to be sent to Europe in the spring of 1945 but the Germans surrendered, and then Japan in the fall of 1945 but then they surrendered. Is this true? I&#39;ll never know. This was sheer luck, as his best friend in high school was in the D-Day invasion in June 1944 but survived a changed man, and many of Dad&#39;s classmates went overseas.</p><p>My Dad&#39;s kid brother Donald, who was commissioned the Air Force in 1951 as an officer after graduating college. His plane was shot down over North Vietnam in 1966, and Don left behind a wife and 4 children.&nbsp;</p><p>Don&#39;s son Maury, my cousin, served 20 years in the Navy.</p><p>Granddad Hamilton, my mother&#39;s father, joined the National Guard when he was at University of Pennsylvania (Class of &#39;29) and served in the cavalry.&nbsp; When the United States entered WWII at the end of 1941, he wanted to serve full time but was not allowed as he was then&nbsp;in his mid 30s with two daughters, and his job as a school teacher was deemed important for the war effort. But he did get to drive army trucks in convoys all the way down to Georgia.</p></div></div>"

"event","I think my iPod&nbsp;is trying to tell me something.&nbsp;
Whenever I get into my Jeep I usually set&nbsp;the iPod&nbsp;on shuffle. The first song this morning on my drive to work was &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; by Sammy Hagar, from the rock soundtrack to the 1982 Canadian animated movie of the same name.&nbsp;It is played during the silly &quot;So Beautiful and So Dangerous&quot; sequence, when a scientist and a stenographer are abducted from the Pentagon by an alien&nbsp;spaceship.&nbsp;
The very next track (there are over 1,700 songs on the iPod) was &quot;Bomber and the Green Ball&quot; by Elmer Bernstein, from the score soundtrack to the same movie. (Yes I own both soundtracks!)&nbsp;This music was from&nbsp;the scary &quot;B-17&quot; sequence, when a glowing green sphere (the Lok-Nar) chases an American B-17 bomber during a night time World War II bombing raid.
This may or may not have been a coincidence, but I was amused.
Then, things got really, really weird.
Just as the &quot;Bomber&quot; music got to the eerie part with the Lok-Nar theme, I pulled up to a red light behind a fairly new red Chevy Camaro.
The license plate on the Camaro said &quot;B17-WWII&quot;!
The Camaro turned away several lights later, and I put the music on repeat.
Cool!"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, this took two months to post!&nbsp; After missing the Spring 2011 semester I&#39;m back at Temple University crawling my way towards a bachelors degree in history with two evening courses, &quot;World War II&quot; and &quot;Jewish Diaspora&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second World War is a &nbsp;subject that I have been reading about for decades, and my wargaming buddies have promised to disown me if I get anything less than an &quot;A&quot;.&nbsp; 8^)&nbsp; My interest was&nbsp;actually sparked by a British television series called &quot;The&nbsp;World&nbsp;At War&quot; that I saw way back in the early &#39;70s. &nbsp;I could teach this course and have many books on &quot;The War&quot;, as my father used to call it. This past spring and summer I dug into my library&nbsp;to refresh myself with the subject.&nbsp; It is the fifth course I&#39;ve taken with the same professor since I came&nbsp;returned to college&nbsp;in the spring 2009 semester.&nbsp; My midterm grade was 102.5 (!) and I had the top grade in the class.&nbsp; As always, he&nbsp;knows his stuff but is&nbsp;falling behind on the syllabus.&nbsp; My term paper, which will be on &quot;Britain and Appeasement&quot; (not exact title) &nbsp;is due in just under two weeks, and I&#39;m busy reading, taking notes, and outlining.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second course, &quot;Jewish Diaspora&quot;, is more problematic.&nbsp; I know little on the subject, and took it because it both fulfilled several core requirements and piqued my interest on my fathers&nbsp;suppressed ancestry.&nbsp; The time line the course covers from the final destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans and dispersion of the Jews in&nbsp;135 CE&nbsp;up until the creation of Israel in 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is both enlightening and depressing. So far I&#39;m getting A&#39;s which I did not expect and my term paper will be on the creation of the Aryan myth. The professor&nbsp;is a rabbi (Reformed) and is&nbsp;an excellent lecturer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the two courses (eight books total) and the two term papers (another eight books) I don&#39;t have time for anything else."

"event","<p>Got your attention? I haven't posted in two weeks. <br /><br />Money?&nbsp;We're getting by.&nbsp;<lj user=""draculachanter""/>&nbsp; has a temp job assignment. <br /><br />N found a local thrift store in Hatboro with some good chairs, cheap! They also had books, but I was good and only got three. In the same&nbsp;neighborhood we found a great bakery and an old-fashioned clock repair shop. The latter was the kind of place that I thought no longer existed. It's a family business that repairs older mechanical timepieces such as mantel clocks and grandfather clocks. Of course everything I wanted was expensive. Someday...<br /><br />Spent Easter Sunday with Mom, my brother Alan, and <lj user=""draculachanter""/>&nbsp;. N made dinner...cloved ham with a brown sugar/orange juice glaze, yam casserole, green beans, rolls from the aforesaid bakery and home made cherry pie. Mom loved it, as she gets tired of the retirement home food. Alan was more talkative than normal, and all in all a good day. That, and we had leftovers for the rest of the week. <br /><br />Over the past month I've seen three movies through Netflix that I had never seen before and that N wanted me to see; &quot;District 9&quot;, &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert&quot;.&nbsp; All good in very different ways. <br /><br />Royal Wedding? I have no opinion either way, but&nbsp;I read very little about the fact that Kate Middleton did not come from an aristocratic background. Is this a first? I hope they're happy. The most impressive thing (to me) about the wedding was the flyover afterwards of three vintage World II British airplanes in formation...a four engine Lancaster bomber, escorted by Spitfire and Hurricane fighters. Now THAT was cool!<br /><br />On Saturday we drove three and a half hours for a picnic. Sounds weird? Well, one of <lj user=""draculachanter""/>&nbsp;s oldest friends from high school has been living in France for the past 15 years, but&nbsp;came&nbsp;back to the states to see her amour out West. N went to see her in France in 2008, and they had not seen each other sionce leaving high school in 1984! She was staying in Washington&nbsp;DC&nbsp;over the weekend before pushing on to parts beyond, so we went down for the day.&nbsp;The weather was perfect, and we had a good friend&nbsp;stop over to watch the animals while we were away. <br /><br />Ns friend loves picnics, so after meeting her at the house she was staying at we went to a local park and had one. The three of us sat on a blanket under a tree, nibbling on food, sipping wine and reciting poetry to each other for several hours. Then we went back to the house, chilled out some more before N and I hit the road at 10 pm. We got home at 2 am.<br /><br />The big news last night was the announced death of Osama bin Laden. I felt nothing at all when I heard the news. Go figure! Today I am not jubilant or fearful but am just glad that he's gone. The war that we are in is not over. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","It has been almost two months since I picked it up, but I finally finished William L Shirer's massive &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; earlier this evening after coming home from work. Two weeks ago I <a href=""http://greene-man.livejournal.com/123954.html"">posted</a> my initial impressions, and now that I am finished they are even <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/151055807"">stronger</a>. Most of the histories that I have read were written long after events, and often the authors aim towards a semblance of objectivity and balance.<br /><br />Shirer has no such pretentions in his book. As I said before, Shirer, an American, had worked in Germany as a journalist from 1934 up until the end of 1940, which was a year after the Second World War started in September 1939.&nbsp; He despised the Nazis, and rightly so. According to his book <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340696-berlin-diary"">Berlin Diary</a>, the Gestapo was planning to arrest him as a hostile correspondent, and this precipitated his exit at the end of 1940. <br /><br />Now I need to decide to read more on the War (as my dad called it), or some fiction."

"event","One of the consequences of using <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1235894-mark-singer"">Goodreads</a> to catalog my library has been rediscovery of old books. The very first adult history book I ever read was &quot;<a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9319087-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-third-reich-a-history-of-nazi-germany"">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a>&quot; by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_L._Shirer"">William L Shirer</a>.&nbsp; I found an old hardback copy sometime in the mid 1970s when I was in my mid-teens and couldn't put it down, and somehow finished the 1200 page tome within a week. The book, along with the early 1970s BBC&nbsp;documentary TV series &quot;<a href=""http://www.theworldatwar.com/about/the-series/"">The World at War</a>&quot; sparked my interest in the Second World War. <br /><br />Over the decades I accumulated many books on the War, but never read them in a systematic fashion. Now that I started to list them all, they have been sorted out and I even came up with a reading list. On February 27 I picked up Shirer's massive tome and started to read it again. Originally published in 1960, only fifteen years after the end of the war, he was writing for an audience that lived through it. Shirer was an American journalist who had been stationed in Germany from 1934 up until December 1940, and had published his experiences after leaving when he returned to the United States with &quot;<a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340696-berlin-diary"">Berlin Diary</a>&quot; in 1941. He later went back to Germany after the war to cover the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials"">Nuremberg Trials</a>. <br /><br />Although &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; is well researched, one of the things I like about it is that Shirer was a journalist, not an historian. He's not detached, and makes no effort to hide his contempt for Adolf Hitler and many members of the Nazi hierarchy. I do not see him as anti-German, just anti-Nazi. Shirer was there, had talked to many of these people, saw them often, and just didn't like them. It's a refreshing viewpoint. <br /><br />The book is a dual history of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Thus far the most disturbing part was about how the Nazis were able to come to power and bring about the end of the flawed Weimar Republic. I could write volumes on that...the deceit, the consistent misunderstanding and undersestimation of Hitler by others, the belief of the German conservatives that they could use Hitler by bringing him and the Nazi party into the government in 1932. <br /><br />Right now I'm up to page 718 of 1246, and am reading about the May 1940 western offensive against Belgium, the Netherlands and France. I should read more of it each day but tend to get bogged down on teh interwebs when I'm home from work."

"event","I consider myself a reasonable well-informed person, and read the news every day on various internet sites, but feel the need to post on everything that happens. &nbsp;For years I have been avoiding television news, so my perspective may be different from those who watch on a regular basis.&nbsp; But here are my three cents on three recent happenings.

1) The revolt in the Maghreb. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Tunisia, then Egypt, and now Libya are undergoing revolts against their dictators. There has also been unrest in Jordan, Yemen and elsewhere.&nbsp;I never thought I would see this,&nbsp;but least some of the strongmen are now turned out. Historical analogies are always dangerous, but this may be like the 1848 revolutions that swept across Europe. Most of the revolts failed, but did point the way for change.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much of the commentary I read was an obsession over whether or not it would be good for the USA. Although some worry was understandable, what matters is how it will affect the lives of the people who live in these countries, not some Islamophobic neo-con&nbsp;sitting on his ass in a Beltway think tank&nbsp;who is obsessed with&nbsp;the impending return of the Caliphate.&nbsp; 

2) The GOP plan to destroy public sector unions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the previous story, this did not surprise me.&nbsp; I read a lot of political blogs,&nbsp;and have been aware of the&nbsp;right&nbsp;wing&nbsp;hatred towards unions for some time.&nbsp; Bringing down the unions is part of a plan to weaken the Democrat party. What happened in Wisconsin will also be tried in some other states.&nbsp; Although I or my parents were not union members, they have changed the lives of my family. My mothers father was a school teacher, and he belonged to an union. Thanks to the union, he was&nbsp;able to make a decent living, and had a small pension. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my paternal great-grandfathers was a founder and the first president of the diamond workers union in New York City. As far as I know, he was the union head from around&nbsp;the early 1900's&nbsp;until his death in 1931. I didn't know much about this until recent years, but am very proud of him.

3) Disaster in&nbsp;Japan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I add to the conversation? The power of the Earth to destroy should never be forgotten. The resilience and patience of the Japanese.&nbsp; As for the nuclear power plants, I'm still pro-nuke, but only if they are under very strict control, as the French do."

"event","I have been collecting books for decades, but it has only been recently that I started to write down what I had. That started after I joined Goodreads several years ago. The cataloging began in earnest in January, and right now I am up to almost 400 titles. I am concentrating on my history collection, and haven't got to the rest of the non-fiction. Total numbers with all other categories? My best guess is about 1,400, and much of that is fiction. 

The embarrassing part is that of the almost 400 titles in the list thus far, I have only read about 110 of them. I won't give a book a rating if I haven't read it. Of the unlisted part of my collection, I know that I have read most if not all of the fiction. For whatever reason, I have not been able to read anything fictitious recently. 

For years I would randomly collect books from book stores, especially the bargain bin; used book stores; library sales; yard sales, book clubs and others. That doesn't include borrowing and returning from the local libraries. At the same time, I have purged books whenever I have moved, most notably in 2003 when I divorced and sold my house. At that time I gave ten boxes of books to the local library for their book sale. I did more over my next two moves. 

To what end? Curiousity. Acquistiveness. Boredom.&nbsp; I cut back on reading when I returned to college two years ago. Now I want to pare down what I have and read the essential stuff.&nbsp; I need to systematically read what I have, and that is one of the reasons that I use Goodreads. To that end, I have been working on a reading program in several categories...ancient history, medieval history, early modern period, World War I, World War II and the post-war world. While taking the relevant college courses, I made up lists for the American Civil War, the American Revolution, and 19th century Europe. 

Once again, to what end? I love history. It's the story of our past, and is better than fiction. You have to know where you're coming form to know where you're going. I could also throw in that overused and misunderstood quote from Santayana, but I won't."

A&nbsp;voice started to talk, low and soft. I could make out some words, and it sounded like a mother talking to her child.

"event","Shortly after leaving work tonight at 5:30 I was in a crash. As I was crossing Roosevelt Boulevard on Grant Avenue, my Jeep was sideswiped by a white Infiniti that blew through a red light.&nbsp; It was sudden and I couldn't avoid getting hit. The Infiniti hit the right rear side of the Jeep and kept on going.&nbsp; I was able to get the Jeep across the intersection before pulling over.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm ok...just briefly annoyed, and oddly calm since shortly after the crash. The entire incident hasn't sunk in yet. As far as I can tell, the right rear wheel assembly was crushed, because it is at an angle.&nbsp; I won't know until tomorrow what the exact damage is.&nbsp; The intersection of Grant Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard is considered  dangerous, but I have crossed it twice a day for the past five years, and have  gone through there at least a thousand times.<br /><br />Fortunately there was a&nbsp; witness who stayed with me until police arrived, and she testified that the perp was in the wrong.&nbsp; By the way, the perp actually came BACK to the scene of the accident just before the police arrived! There are cameras at the intersection that record the license plates of vehicles that blow through red lights. <br /><br />Who did I call?&nbsp;&nbsp; 911 for the police, my insurance company, a towing service that I have through my Chrysler warranty and of course, <lj user=""draculachanter""/>&nbsp;.  She came to the scene of the crash as quickly as she could. The Jeep was towed to the dealership where I have it serviced, and we went there briefly.&nbsp; Then it was dinner at a diner, and home by 10:00.<br /><br />Time for a hot shower and bed.<br /><br />"

"event","On this day I honor all the men and women who have served in the armed forces, and I want to mention the men in my family who did so:

First is Grandpa Maurice,&nbsp;who  joined the Army right after graduating college in April 1917  and then was sent to&nbsp;France during World War I. He was with the Corps of  Engineers and served with the famous 77th &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; Division  which was composed entirely of men from New York City. Grandpa never talked about the war to me before he died in 1980 at the age of 84, but I heard some fairly bleak second-hand tales from my father. 

Dad  served in the Army stateside from January 1944 through the middle of 1946. He was was an artilleryman, and according to his service documents (which I have) was trained as a forward observer (flash range finder) and a gun tractor driver. His unit was used to train other units. Dad later claimed that he was meant to be sent to Europe in the spring of 1945 but the Germans surrendered, and then Japan in the fall of 1945 but then they surrendered. Is this true? I'll never know. This was sheer luck, as his  best friend in high school was in the D-Day invasion in June 1944 but  survived a changed man, and many of Dad's classmates went overseas. 

My Dad's kid brother Donald, who was commissioned the Air Force in 1951 as an officer after graduating college. His plane was shot down over North  Vietnam in 1966, and Don left behind a wife and 4 children.&nbsp; 

Don's son Maury, my cousin, served 20 years in the Navy.

Granddad  Hamilton, my mother's father, joined the National Guard when he was at University of  Pennsylvania (Class of '29) and served in the cavalry.&nbsp; When the United States entered WWII at the end of 1941, he wanted to  serve full time but was not allowed as he was then&nbsp;in his mid 30s with  two daughters, and his job as a school teacher was deemed important for  the war effort. But he did get to drive army trucks in convoys all the  way down to Georgia."

He was only 39.&nbsp; Matt and Anne&nbsp;had been together for&nbsp;eighteen years and were married for the last&nbsp;fifteen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Anne had an informal service at their house for friends and family as&nbsp;she did not want a funeral.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many photo albums of their life togther to look at, and many of them were of halloween parties of years past where they and their friends dressed up.&nbsp; After the albums, I started to notice all of his stuff.&nbsp; He had things I had never seen, like a 2' tall Dalek, sonic screwdrivers and about six different Tardises...Tardii?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maquettes from the 1970s' anime &quot;Battle of The Planets&quot; (aka Gatchaman) and the 1920's movie &quot;Metropolis&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then Anne asked us to go down into what used to be a garage, and what I saw there was a bit overwhelming.&nbsp; There were&nbsp;easily two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;action figures on display.&nbsp;They were open on shelves, or in their display packs&nbsp;attached directly to&nbsp;the walls or to overhead wooden ceiling beams.&nbsp; Hanging from the ceiling, nailed across ceiling beams and wrapped around support posts were tiny christmas lights for extra illumination.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Where do I start? There were hundreds and hundreds of figures&nbsp;of Marvel super heroes just as many Star Wars characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;The DC&nbsp;universe was also represented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many characters from The Simpsons. There were more from&nbsp;Hellboy, Battle of the Planets/Gatchaman,&nbsp; He-Man&nbsp;and the Masters of the Universe, and 1980s' era GI-Joe heroes and their COBRA&nbsp;nemeses.&nbsp; 1960s Rankin-Bass claymation figures from stories like &quot;Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred figures from the new Doctor Who series,&nbsp;many of them duplicate. &nbsp;(There must have been five Weeping Angels, and the concept of a Weeping Angel action figure seems like a contradiction, but I digress)&nbsp;Star Trek - Classic, Next Gen, DS-9, Voyager and Enterprise. &nbsp;Babylon 5, Beatles figures from &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.&nbsp; I even saw the monster from &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monster&quot;.&nbsp; Rock stars. Porn stars. Breakfast cereal characters like Captain Crunch.&nbsp; And many more that I can not remember right now.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;most of&nbsp;Matt's friends and family who were there, I ended up looking at the collection twice, and I'm not sure that I saw everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","As stated in <a href=""http://www.eldritchdark.com/"">The Eldritch Dark</a>, Clark Ashton Smith (1893-1961) is primarily remembered today, if at all, for his association with H P Lovecraft and the so-called Cthulhu Mythos.&nbsp; Clark Ashton Smith, (or CAS)&nbsp;was a master storyteller and wrote excellent weird fantasy and horror. In some respects, I even prefer his work to that&nbsp;of his friend H P Lovecraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition being&nbsp;a well-regarded&nbsp;poet, CAS was also an artist and sculptor.&nbsp; <br /><br />I first discovered CAS&nbsp;in the early 1970s when I read <a href=""http://www.eldritchdark.com/writings/short-stories/226/the-uncharted-isle"">The Uncharted Isle</a> in a collection of short stories and it left quite an impression on my adolescent mind.&nbsp; Last night I read the story out loud to <lj user=""draculachanter""/>&nbsp; before we went to sleep! &nbsp; Later I found <a href=""http://www.eldritchdark.com/writings/short-stories/183/the-return-of-the-sorcerer"">The Return of The Sorceror</a> in &quot;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos_anthology"">Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos</a>&quot;.&nbsp; It had been adapted into an episode of Rod Serling's &quot;<a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/58793/night-gallery-the-return-of-the-sorcerer"">The Night Gallery</a>&quot; with Vincent Price and Bill Bixby.&nbsp; In&nbsp;my opinion,&nbsp;it&nbsp;was one of CAS's worst stories, but is one that most people are familiar with.<br /><br />At the age of 14 I found that my local public library had copies of &quot;Lost Worlds&quot; and &quot;Out of Space and Time&quot;, two of the Arkham House collections of CAS's short stories, and I checked them out over and over again. Eventually I committed the unforgivable biblio-sin of keeping the books for a year, but paid off the fine when there was an amnesty at the library!&nbsp; I also found a Ballantine paperback collection called &quot;Poseidonis&quot;.&nbsp; CAS wrote stories set in exotic locations such as lost Poseidonis (his version of Atlantis), Xothique (the last continent on Earth in the far future), Averoigne (a fictional region of medieval France), and our world. <br /><br />Eventually my interests changed and forgot CAS. His books were out of print and were very difficult to find. &nbsp;In 1989, I found an Arkham House hardback collection titled &quot;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rendezvous_in_Averoigne"">A Rendezvous in Averoigne</a>&quot;, and snapped it up.&nbsp; It had a wonderful forward by Ray Bradbury and unusual photo artwork by <a href=""http://jkpotter.com/page2.html"">Jeffrey K Potter</a>.&nbsp; For lack of a better word I would call it a &quot;best of&quot;, as it included wonderful stories like the title, &quot;The City of the Singing Flame&quot;, &quot;The Death of Malygris&quot;, &quot;The Maze of Maal Dweb&quot;, &quot;The Colossus of Ylourgne&quot;, &quot;The Empire of the Necromancers&quot;, and many others.<br /><br />In more recent years <a href=""http://www.nightshadebooks.com/cart.php?m=product_detail&amp;p=88"">Night Shade Press</a> has been publishing&nbsp;a definitive five volume collection of CAS short stories in chronological order, and I have the first three.&nbsp; As for his poetry, several years ago <lj user=""draculachanter""/>&nbsp; gave me a selected collection of his best, called &quot;<a href=""http://www.hippocampuspress.com/clark-ashton-smith/fiction/the-last-oblivion-best-fantastic-poems-of-clark-ashton-smith"">The Last Oblivion: Best Fantastic Poems of Clark Ashton Smith</a>&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of his poems are sonnets, but there is also unusual stuff like &quot;<a href=""http://www.eldritchdark.com/writings/poetry/572"">The Hashish Eater or The Apocalypse of Evil</a>&quot;,&nbsp;a 500 line collection of blank verse that begins with&nbsp;&quot;Bow down: I am the emperor of dreams&quot;.<br /><br />There was a complete 3 volume hardback collection of his poetry and translations, but it was $150.00 and I held off. Someday...<br /><br />As you can see by going to <a href=""http://www.eldritchdark.com/"">The Eldritch Dark</a>, Clark Ashton Smith's work is accessible on-line, but I want to have paper, because I'm old fashioned that way.<br /><br /><br />"

"event","That analogy came to me as I was going to sleep last night.&nbsp; As some of you may know, this is the second time around for me with home ownership. That began in 1994 in Jenkintown and went down in flames in 2003 when I ended my previous life by selling that house, filing for divorce, and most importantly, maintaining my sanity. This is different.<br /><br />After selling the house in September 2003, I lived in an apartment. In December 2005, I moved in with <lj user=""draculachanter""/>&nbsp; in a rented house.&nbsp; Now we have bought a house together in Elkins Park, and that is a lifetime commitment. I just signed off on a 30 year mortgage at the age of 49. Who knows where I'll be in 30 years, or if I'll even be around? <br /><br />I'm not worried about that. It's the journey that counts. <br /><br />Our old lease at the rental does not expire until September 30, and the six week overlap will help. We expect to do the &quot;big move&quot; in early September, which will give us time to come back and clean the house as much as possible so we can get our deposit back. In the meantime, we have already moved some minor things into the new place like books, lights and chairs, and just spent most of Saturday and Sunday ripping up wall-to-wall carpet in two of the bedrooms. <br /><br />Slicing the carpet was the easy part; what was tedious was removing the wooden strips nailed to the floor by the baseboards with the carpet tacks ticking up as well as pulling up all of the staples in the floor. What I uncovered in the middle bedroom was a beautiful wooden floor that was almost identical to the one in the dining room, with dark brown trim parallel to the walls. The overall color is much darker than downstairs dark but when I am done with the vacuuming and putting some Murphy's Oil Soap down it should be much nicer. <br /><br />The front bedroom, unlike the middle or the back, had the same 8&quot; wide planking on the floor that was in the hallway, This may be the original floor from 1821.

"event","<lj-cut text=""A long post about death and memory behind the cut"">My father passed way on March 22, 1993. He was 67 and was done in by &nbsp;prostate cancer.&nbsp; Of course I can't forget him, and when the anniversary of death approaches, I think about him even more.&nbsp; It''s hard to write about him without the inevitable comparison to myself but here goes.&nbsp; How could I write the positive and negative about him? He was my father, that's why.<br /><br />At his best, he could be outgoing, warm and talkative, unlike my mother who&nbsp;was, and still is, &nbsp;more introverted. One of the traits I get from him is his willingness to hug. My geekiness also comes from him as he was a rail fan (they're called &quot;Trainspotters&quot; in the UK, but I digress) in&nbsp;his youth and took many&nbsp;photographs of trains and trolleys, some of which were later published.&nbsp; He was also a huge auto racing fan...Indianapolis 500, stock cars and Nascar. Dad used to take us to the stock car races at the Reading&nbsp;Fairgrounds in the late 60's and early 70's. I still remember how loud it was. He would hang out in the pits with his friends who owned a car while we would stay in the stands with&nbsp;Mom. <br /><br />He could be blunt when he chose to be, and&nbsp;did not suffer fools gladly. &nbsp;At our family church, he was an usher and a&nbsp;Trustee and butted heads with some of those who ran the congregation with their nutty financial schemes. In 1988, years after I had stopped attending, I went with him to a meeting where church reorganization was discussed. He made his argument against it, and that was that. There was a class structure there (that's one of many&nbsp; reasons I stopped going, but I digress again) and we were not one of the rich families who ran the church. At his funeral I was pleasantly surprised when many of his fellow congregants complimented him on his willingness to stand up for his beliefs, even some of those with whom he had disagreed.<br /><br /><br />At his worst...well?&nbsp;Dad had an explosive temper which I learned at an early age to work around. He used the belt as punishment until I was 10. The smallest things would make him angry. When we packed to go on vacation he could be a monster. Not until we got&nbsp;where were going to&nbsp;would he calm down.&nbsp;In his later years he mellowed out somewhat.&nbsp; He, like his parents, was a&nbsp;packrat&nbsp;and&nbsp; filled up our garage with all&nbsp;sorts of crap. He even had a tire collection that we had to get rid of after the neighbors complained. &nbsp;In high school I had to read Arthur Miller's &quot;Death of A Salesman&quot; and it struck me that Dad was very much like Willy Loman, unhappy and lost in his job. That's the very worst thing I could ever say about him.<br /><br />My parents were married for 33 years until his death. Their relationship wan't perfect, none are, but they stayed together.&nbsp;Dad raised us as best he could. In the end he faced death bravely. He knew that his cancer was inoperable and signed a living will which requires that no extraordinary measures were to be taken to extend his life.&nbsp;<br /><br /><p><wbr></wbr>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></wbr>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></wbr>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></wbr>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Second memory</p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Under the cut"">On March 22 1993, my father, Jack, died from cancer at the age of 67. Saturday was the 16th anniversary of his passing. In the August of 1992 he became ill when we were on vacation and&nbsp;was diagnosed with prostate cancer. The shocker was that he had been treated for it ten years previously but my parents in their wisdom (!) decided not to tell anyone. The cancer had supposedly been cured but came back, mestasisized and spread through the middle of his body, entwining itself into many of his vital organs.<br /><br />Jack (his birth name was Jacques but was never called that) underwent chemotherapy which he hated saying &nbsp;that the cure was more painful then his cancer. Because he had undergone radiation treatment during the initial illness ten years before they coudn't do it again or so we were told. <br /><br />Since his immune system was suppressed,&nbsp;Jack became ill several times and was in and out of the hospital. Dad &nbsp;had always been stocky and muscular&nbsp;(although tending towards heavy) and never had a grey hair until his mid-50's. All of this changed as the illness spread. He&nbsp;became weak, his once once salt-and-pepper hair turned white and his skin went from fair to sallow. <br /><br />The final illness was pneumonia. On the second day he was in the hospital,&nbsp;the family&nbsp;were at his bedside&nbsp;when he said &quot;I can't breathe&quot;. The doctors and nurses sent all of us&nbsp;out of the room. I should also mention that Dad had signed a living will asking that no extraordinary measures were to be taken and he didn't want to be on life support. There was nothing to be done.&nbsp;<br /><br />I picked up a bible in the waiting room and began to read the Book of Genesis from the beginning. It gave me no comfort.&nbsp; Maybe I should have read from the Psalms or even Ecclesiastes which is more to my tastes. To this day I can't remember how long we waited when a doctor came&nbsp;in and said &quot;He's gone&quot;. <br /><br />We came into the room. Dad lay sprawled on the hospital bed, his eyes open even in death. I looked onto his eyes. There was nothing. That image will be with me until I die. <br /><br />I celebrate his life.</lj-cut><br style=""clear: both"" /><hr width=""100%"" align=""center"" size=""2"" /><script language=""JavaScript"" type=""text/javascript"">

"event","Last night I went down to the Ritz at the Bourse with <lj user=""radiofreerlyeh"">&nbsp;, <lj user=""titaniumjunky"">&nbsp;, and <lj user=""webpollution"">&nbsp; to see Bruce Campbell's newest movie, &quot;My Name is Bruce&quot;. Without giving too much away, Bruce plays an exaggerated version of himself...a boorish, alcoholic and lecherous B-movie&nbsp;actor whose life is changed by fans think he really can fight monsters! Bruce Campbell himself was there, both before and after the screening, and answered questions about the making of the movie as well as typical fannish inquiries."

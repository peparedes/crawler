"event","freakin-a... i got called a moron today... stupid bryce.. grr... it was for a stupid reason too.. we were reviewin for a test in world history.. and me and him were on the same team.. right now we're learnin about the Renaissance.. and the question was about the monk's 95 theses that he nailed to the door of the catholic church.. i pronounced theses wrong.. i pronounced it.. ""thesis"" and he called me a moron for that.. i don't even talk to him.. how's he gonna call me a moron.. 
i forgot to tell yall yesterday that gabby made me a shirt.. out of her shorts... she had me put my head and one arm thru one leg and my other arm thru the other leg.. then she safety-pinned the back of it to where it wasn't so loose.. then she made some slits above the breast area and put safety-pins on them.. it was pimp... it matched my converse shoes.. cuz we had a green and white shirt underneath the shorts.. and i was wearin black jeans.. and my shoes are green with pink lining.. and the tip of them are white.. and then the black just goes with ne thang.. so it was pretty pimp.. 
well.. not much to say.. so.. later!
i love chris!!"

"event","ok.. so i was goin out with steven for a lil over 2 months.. but only a few days over.. he waited until a couple of weeks after my b-day.. so it was about the first week of august.. right before school.. the stupid person breaks up with me.. guess why.. he said that since school was about to start, we wouldn't get to see each other very much.. i'm like.. ""well we rarely got to see each other durin the summer and that could b the hardest time to have a boyfriend/girlfriend"" but get this.. a week later he calls me up.. and guess what.. he's gonna b goin to my school!! so i'm hopin that maybe he'll ask me out.. but no.. u know what i find out?? he's been talkin to some other chick and i have a pretty good feeling that's why he broke up with me.. and someone told me that when he had went to camp over the summer he met a girl.. and they had been txting back and forth.. i was sooo pissed. omg.. i wanted to kill him.. but i still really liked him.. so yeah.. 
after me and steven broke up that time... i was single for about a month.. then.. a different dude that was involved with the spring break thing asked me out.. me and him have been friends for like 4 years.. his name was chris.. we went out for not even a week.. part of the reason we broke up was becuz we've been friends for so long that it was kinda weird.. another reason.. and the main one.. was becuz i started likin someone else.. like a lot.. and i didn't think it was fair to chris that i was with him but thinkin of someone else.. 
me and this other dude, zak, were talkin for a while... then he said he was goin to ask me out.. so i waited.. he gave me a deadline as to when he was goin to.. and by the time the deadline came.. and he didn't ask me.. i gave up.. 
since i gave up on zak... i started goin out with craig.. he was originally goin to ask gabby out.. she was supposed to call him.. but he said he got tired of waitin.. so he asked me out.. i felt bad tho becuz gabby really liked him too... she told me she wouldn't get mad.. i guess i didn't read between the lines.. becuz she got mad.. 
well me and craig went out for maybe a week.. then i made it to where he had to break up with me.. i'm not sure as to why.. idr.. but i guess things just weren't really workin out and i didn't want to b with him.. mainly cuz gabby wanted him.. i just felt so bad... 
then.. about 6 days later.. i started goin out with a different chris.. chris r... as of today we've been together for a month and 15 days.. we have our difficulties.. and hopefully there won't b ne more.. actually.. we got in an argument bcuz he really doesn't like one of the people that i hang out with.. not going into why.. but he didn't really want me hangin around him.. so i was like ok.. and i tried for a while.. then the subject came up again.. and we nearly broke up.. but we worked it out.. come to find out.. i'm not really kewl with that friend ne more.. they really tick me off.. especially lately..
so thanksgiving was the other day.. my family actually got along.. with the exception of my niece and my cousin.. but they're like 5.. so it's kewl.. 
i've learned how to skin deer.. that's my job now when i go to my mom's.. i've done 5 since gun season started.. i do pretty good... so they tell me.. i get paid 15 bucks a deer.. so it's kewl.. a lot of ppl can't believe i actually do it. but.. i do.. lol.. 
omg.. the other day i went to mcdonald's and we went thru the drive-thru.. well there was this guy at the first window and he like kept staring at me and smiling and crap.. well.. we drove up to the next window to get our food.. and there's the dude.. he looked and smiled at me as we drove off.. when we got home.. i emptied out the bag and you'll never guess what happened.. the dude wrote his number down and put it in my bag! it was crazy... later i was talkin to him.. and he asked if i was embarrassed.. i was like.. i'm just weirded-out.. he was like.. ""why?"" and i said ""bcuz usually guys don't do that."" he was like..""really? that's a shock!"" and i'm like.. ""why do u say that?"" and he said.. ""bcuz your extremely attractive.."" i was like..""yeah.. whatever.."" it was crazy.. 
so my niece turned 6 on the 20th.. well she had her bday party on the 19th.. my bro. rented a bounce house for all the kids.. well.. i wanted to go in.. so me and marcus went in there and we were playin with the lil kids... before marcus got there i had already been in there playin with the kids.. it was crazy.. they decided to jump me.. it was ethan (my lil cousin), miranda (jasmine's best friend), jasmine (my niece), some other chick (friend of jasmine's), and ryan (other lil cousin).. jasmine and ryan had my legs.. miranda was covering my face.. i couldn't breathe.. ethan was like tickling me.. and the other chick was like kicking me.. idk.. but once i pushed one off.. another one came at me.. it was crazy.. when marcus got there they decided to mess with him.. then aaron (my bro) decided to tackle me.. he was standin on his knees and he picked me up over his shoulder and went to sling me down.. i freaked out.. and i accidentally kneed him in his nose.. lol. marcus tackled me a few times.. it was fun.. then we went out to eat.. the whole family, cara, and marcus.. we met my uncle jimmy's new girlfriend.. she's really pretty.. 
we found out some interesting news.. jimmy's son, derek, is gonna b a daddy.. the baby is due in may..
crystal could have her baby at ne time now.. that's what mom said ne way.. i'm so excited.. it's gonna b a boy.. it's gonna b a perdy baby! i'm so excited!!! well i'm gonna go.. later!
i love chris!"

"event","hey guys.. sorry it's been so long since i've written.. i've practically been out of town since school let out..like right now i'm at my brother's house in san angelo.. 
    last wednesday my dad went to the ER (emergency room)... he had been feelin bad for a while..like he was havin trouble breathin..and he couldn't really move since he couldn't really breathe.. so.. that caused him to not get a whole lot of sleep.. but.. after a week of feelin like this.. he decided to go to the doctor to see what was wrong with him.. they ran some tests on him.. and it turns out he had double pnemonia (which means he had pnemonia in both lungs), high blood pressure, a weak heart, and he was anemic (didn't have enough iron in his body).. they had him in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for one night.. until his blood pressure went down.. then they put him in a regular room.. they let him out the day after they placed him in a regular room.. his medications cost about $200.. he said we might have to get rid of our car.. but i'm not sure about that.. i hope not..
   man.. there was some drama between me, dusty and steven.. see.. i was goin out with dusty.. but then he broke up with me to go out with a chik named alissa.. well. i started talkin to my ex, steven.. then.. dusty decided that he still wanted to b with me.. so.. he called me up.. and was sayin that me and him was goin out.. and i was like.. ""no we're not goin out cuz u didn't ask me back out.."" and he said.. ""well even if i did ask you out you would say no cuz you like steven"" then dusty said that he would fight steven for me.. and i told cara that and cara told steven that and steven said that he would take him.. and then i said no because i don't want them fightin bcuz i don't like violence.. so cara told steven that.. and then steven said that he wouldn't fight bcuz i didn't want them to.. but dusty still wanted to.. so the whole night dusty was beggin me to go out with him.. so.. finally.. i caved in.. i waited a couple of days and then i broke up with him.. well. actually, i got cara to call him and tell him bcuz i knew he'd ask me why.. and the only reason was bcuz i liked steven more.. and if i told dusty that.. he would just wanna fight him even more.. so.. me and dusty broke up... cara told steven about me and dusty breakin up.. and a couple of days later.. steven asked me out.. and i said yes... and as far as i know, dusty still don't know that me and steven r goin out.. but a few days ago.. my cousin called me and told me that dusty was tellin people that me and him was still goin out.. and it was just crazy.. 
   well.. i don't know what else to say.. i'm gettin distracted by a strawberry shortcake movie that my brother's girlfriend's daughter is watchin.. and plus.. cara wants to get on.. if i find somethin else to talk about.. i'll  fill y'all in..

"event","hey guys! i am comfort suites right now.. i'm visitin my cousin marty.. i'm finally comin home tomorrow... darn! lol.. jk.. um... 
   i got to see my bro this weekend! that was fun.. me and cara rode down here with him friday.. he took us out of school early... he he.. we met his girlfriend krystal..she was nice.. sometimes she had her moments... but.. she's really kewl.. i like her.. but yeah.. 
   they left saturday... right before the fajitas at the fajita cook out were about to be served.. i tried the fajitas.. but.. i didn't like them.. too ""hot"" for me.. they burned my lips and tongue.. and i didn't like it.. lol..
   i like a new guy now.. it's greg... saturday we (me and cara) went fishing with him, josh and shane... it was fun..shane caught a 4 lb. bass... josh tackled it too! it was hilarious.. me and cara were just sittin there.. and shane's yellin ""i caught a big bass!"" and josh ran over there.... then greg ran over there.. and josh tackled it.. omg.. it was just sooooo funny.. it woulda been funnier if josh woulda fallen in the pond while tackling it.. 
   we went to like 3 different ponds.. me and cara had to walk every where.. while josh and greg rode in greg's truck!! 
   josh and cara kinda hooked up this weekend.. saturday night.. they were comin over after the fajita thing.. and we (me cara greg and josh) had to ride in the back of the truck and josh and cara were all cuddlin and everything.. and they kissed!! aww!!! ne ways.. greg's cuter!
   josh and shane both tell me that greg likes me.. but i don't know b/c he was sendin me mixed signals all night.. cara asked him if he did.. and he said that i was pretty kewl and everything.. and then josh was tellin me that greg told josh that he likes me.. but.. idk..this is josh we're talkin about! and then i asked shane why he thinks greg likes me.. and he said he just knows.. but.. shane is only 12.. what does he know?
   me and cara traded pants when we got to the second pond.. cuz the pants i was wearin was too big.. and cara has a bigger butt than me.. so i figured they'd fit her better..but they didn't... but ne ways.. we went into a part of the woods where we THOUGHT nobody could see us.. but.. we were mistaken cuz shane snuck up on us... and.. he saw cara's butt... she was all freakin out and crap! it was hilarious!!! shane went back and told josh and greg and they were all like, ""we wanna see!"" and we were like, ""no!"" and yeah.. it was just really funny.. 
   then.. cara and josh traded pants while we were at patty and david's.. that was pretty funny.. josh's pants looked really cute on cara.. even tho they were baggy.. but.. they were still cute.. and the pants cara was wearin.. which were mine.. looked really funny on josh.. they were like.. kinda tight... and.. he doesn't have a butt at all! omg.. 
   i was thinkin about tradin pants with greg..but.. he's like way skinny.. so.. i didn't think i could fit in his.. but.. ne ways.. greg had a hole in the back of his pants.. and his boxers were all showin.. it was funny... 
   o... there was this dude.. about to come into the computer room to use the computer.. and he didn't see us until he got to the door.. so... he tried to pull it off like he was goin into the breakfast area.. then he went over by the elevator.. it was kinda funny.. danielle was wonderin if he was thinkin that her and cara were gay cuz danielle is like sittin in cara's lap.. and yeah..
   on the way over to greg's house (which was where the 3rd pond we went to) i had to ride in the back of greg's truck.. by myself.. cuz cara was sittin up front... and greg's bike almost fell on me.. it was kinda scary cuz that's a big bike... it was a mx bike.. 
   greg and josh are buffin out the paint on his truck to re-paint it... it looked kewl after they had sanded down one of the sides.. it looked kinda like camo.. except it was silver, red, and green..... i think they shoulda left it like that cuz the color they're doin it is kinda ugly.. it's like a grey color.. i don't like it.. but.. oh well.. it ain't my truck! 
   oh.. there's this really kewl thing on the engine of his truck... when he plays music.. there's this green light on the engine that lights up to the beat of the music... he's got a light on the inside of his truck that does that too.. it was kewl.. 
   well.. i guess i'll be goin cuz i don't know what else to say!! so bye!!!

"event","sorry that i haven't written in a while... i've been kinda busy.... 
this week was spring break. i didn't have as much fun as i had planned, but when i look back at what happened, it was pretty fun. but it's not over yet!!! 
the first night we were out, i went to a friend's. he was supposed to b havin a party, but while i was there, not a lot went on. it was only me, meagan, becca, jessica, kearstin, randy, james and jeremy. but after a lil while, james and jeremy left. things got a little out of hand. people were arguing and it just wasn't all that fun. we almost got attacked by a bull. well, not really. but we could have. i ended up callin my dad to come pick me up. when my dad got there, eric, james, and jeremy walked up. i left, and i ended up goin over to chapman's. he showed me around the neighborhood, but it was kinda dark, so i didn't really get to see much of it. i stayed the night, but i had to leave early the next morning. so i ended up havin to wake up at about 5:45 the next morning. i was really tired for the rest of the day, but it was alright. at least i got to see him before i left for the next 5 days. we had to meet my mom early that morning anyways cuz she couldn't meet the night before (it was skippy's funeral. R.I.P. Skippy! we miss you!) :( that's so sad... 
that night we didn't really do anything. we got to see Roy. OMG! roy is married!! that really sux... he lied to me and cara then... he told us he only had a gf... he never said ne thang about a wife. he's only 18! at least that's what he told us... unless he lied again.. but one of the employees at the Wal-Mart that he works at said that he was married and had a kid! so the next day when i saw him, i looked.. and sure enough there was a ring on his ring finger on his left hand! 
anyways...
the next day, which was sunday, me and cara went over to josh's house. we kinda snuck over there. i mean, my mom knew we were goin over there, cuz she kinda took us over there, but josh's mom didn't know. so it was just me, cara, josh, and matt (my ex)... i know i have a boyfriend and all, but matt looked soo cute... i still kinda like him. but now i'm with someone else.
when i first talked to matt, i said, ""wow. i'm surprised u'r actually talkin to me."" and he said, ""what's that supposed to mean?"" and i said, ""well, when we started goin out, it appeared to me that u don't talk to ur ex-girlfriends whenever y'all break up, so since we broke up, i didn't think u would talk to me."" and he said, ""no. it's not like that. i just didn't have enough time for a girlfriend at the time."" so i don't know... 
but ne ways..
when we got to josh's... they were watchin napoleon dynamite. josh's dog was goin crazy. he kept humpin my arm and was just jumpin all over cara. we didn't stay for long. my mom and mike came back to pick us up in less than 20 mins. but that's alright... at least we got to go somewhere else for a change. 
we invited matt and josh to go swimming with us the next day, but we kinda doubted that josh would go cuz he hurt his foot skateboarding. 
so the next day, monday, we went swimming in a hotel. we were visiting my cousin, marty. i call him my uncle tho, for some strange reason. but ne ways... there was like this old lookin dude that was in there with his wife and 2 kids, and he kept lookin down mine and cara's bathin suit tops.. it was so gross.. this dude looked like he was in his late 30s or early 40s.... it was sooo nasty..
and this other old dude, who looked about 50.. kept followin cara.. 
we have a freakin stalker at the Wal-Mart that Roy and Mike work at... he was scarin us.. we were wakin out to the car (me and cara) lookin for Roy, and this dude keeps lookin at us... he works there too.. so he's over 20... but... he was watchin us the whole time we were walkin to our car... then.. he got in his truck amd kept drivin by us in the parkin lot.. he drove around us like at least 10 times.. then he parked and was watchin us... it was soo freakin us out... then he drove by again.. but.. then he saw my mom and mike comin and he drove off to a store beside the wal-mart. it was freaky... 
we didn't really do ne thang on wednesday.. we played with the puppies... 
one night, i think it was tuesday, shreveport and his friend john came over... shreveport's 19, and john's 17... john goes to the same school as matt.. lol. but ne ways... shreveport was givin danielle a lap dance.. it was soo funny... they were free-stylin... it was pretty kewl... they're fun ppl.. shreveport was really cute.. lol.. i think john looked like Diego Luna (from Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights)... and shreveport reminded me of Hutsell... 
one of danielle's ex-bfs think i sound soo hot on the phone... it's crazy... but ne ways...
today me and cara came home... we had to ride with my grandpa... we went all the way to dallas first cuz he had to go drop some parts off...  the workers there kept lookin at me and cara.. they weren't that cute.. lol..
then we went to eat at Olive Garden in McKinney... i saw my BCIS teacher, Ms. Phillips... we talked to her for a while... she just found out that she might have diabeties.. (or however u spell it).. so that's bad... but.. they're not for sure yet... she's gonna find out soon tho.. i hope she's ok... she wants us to pray for her.. so.. i told her we would at church... 
i'm soo lookin forward to tomorrow... my boyfriend is givin me a surprise.. he says i'll like it.. but idk what it is yet.. i wanna know soo bad!!!!!!!! lol.. ne ways..
i guess i'll b writin u about it later..bye bye!

"event","Well... i found somethin out this past sunday... accordin to matt.. me and him broke up a long time ago... apparently.. i didn't get the memo.. cuz i found out on our 4 month anniversary... i swear.. i hate it when people do that.. it's so ignorant.. he coulda at least called my mom and have her call me... instead of just leavin me hangin... u know?? but.. maybe he was just smokin too much weed and forgot about me... 
     we were drinkin friday and saturday... and on saturday.. they brought some ""fred bailey"" over... and we got a buzz off of smellin it... lol.. but it was fun..
     saturday mornin i dyed my hair.. it looks really good.. i like it... it was supposed to be a reddish color.. but... i think the dye sat in it for too long and it got darker than i wanted it.. but it looks good.. then i got the ends of my hair colored black.. but the rest of my hair is so dark u can't really tell...
     i finally got to see Precious's puppies.. they're adorable... we named them... my favorite is Bear... i almost called him Slippers cuz he's pure black.. except for on each paw, the tip is white... so it looks like he's wearin slippers.. but.. i liked the name Bear better.. cuz he's really fat too... lol... then there's Ginger... she's so cute... she's a real light brown.... she's really friendly... we were gonna name her Jasmine.. but... while we were tellin my mom their names.. i thought of Ginger.. so we named her Ginger... Cinnamon is Chapman's puppy.... he's a pretty big puppy too.. but.. i think Bear is bigger... Cinnamon is a reddish-brown colored puppy... he's a lil strange tho... he'll started barkin at nothin.. but it's soo funny... then there's oreo.... she's white and black.. she looks a lot like one of our chihuahuas.... so.. i kinda think he's the dad... but... then again.. idk... lol.. then there's Roky... she looks like a rockweiler... so we called her Rocky.. she's really cute... and photogenic... we got a lot of pics of her.. lol.. and then there's Snowball... he's pure white... he's the loudest i think.. he barks at u.. it is soo cute.. he's like the leader cuz it seems to me that all the other puppies follow him.. they're all soo cute... if u want a puppy.. let me know.. my mom is tryin to get rid of them.. they have enough dogs..
     i'm not supposed to know this.. but.. my dad and his girlfriend, jessica, are prollly gonna break up... that's what my lil cuzin told me.. and she's like best friends with jessica's daughter.. it's gonna b sooo sad.. cuz my dad really likes her.. this is the longest relationship he's had with ne one since the divorce (6 years ago this July)... and this is really the first girlfriend that he's gotten that i actually like... she's kewl to b around... and she's just a lot of fun... her daughters r a trip to.. i'm just gonna b sad if they do break up... i'm not sure y they're goin to.. i forgot what my cuzin said.. but.. i just hope they don't.. my dad will be sooo sad..
     Patty and David got into another fight...idk what happened.. i didn't see ne of it.. i just heard 'em... they were yellin.. and slammin doors... since patty was drunk... my mom made us hide her keys... that way she couldn't drive ne where... and perhaps get in a wreck or get pulled over and get a dwi... so we hid the keys.. when she couldn't find them... she got really pissed... i felt bad.. and i wanted to give her the keys.. but.. that would put her life in danger.. and i didn't wanna do that.. so we kept quiet.. 
     i got to see the Notebook... it was a pretty good movie.. i thought it was really funny in some parts.. but.. others were sad... danielle cried like 3 times... 
     ne ways.. i'm outta things to say... so.. i guess i'll write later!! 
Peace out!"

"event","hey guys.. sorry i haven't been writing.. i've had too much work to do for school... and then i didn't have ne access to the internet at  home.. but i'm finally writing!! yay!!
     ok.. i'm gonna start with wednesday.... after school, there was quiet a few people over.. it was me, cara, meagan, gabby, hannah, autumn, holly, jamie, collin, and joseph... well... Jamie decided he wanted to pierce his nipple..so he got one of my earrings...and he actually got it halfway thru... but.. he stopped... idk y.. he was sooo close.. lol.. but i guess he just couldn't handle the pain!! lol.. but ne ways... 
     church was ok wednesday.... we had our youth valentine banquet.. all there really was was snacks.. there was cupcakes, chips, and drinks... there was games too.. but.. most of us just sat or stood and talked... 
     after the banquet... they let us go into the gym and play or w/e... well.. when the younger kids were let out, autumn and hannah came over to me... and i was standin by evan...and autumn whispers to me, ""he is soo hott!!"" and hannah was like, ""yeah.. he is.."" so..when they went away.. i told evan that they think he's hot... he said, ""eww.. and what grade r they in again?"" and i was like, ""6th"" and he just made a face... then... i told hannah that i told him.. and she goes up to him.. while i'm standin there... and tells him that i think he's cute... and he looked at her.. and he said, ""so.. i think she's hot.."" and it was just funny.. idk y exactly.. but it was... when she walked away. i said to him... ""jerod told me that  u and him think i'm hot..."" and he was all blushing.. kinda.. lol.. and then i was like, ""yeah. cuz i kinda heard you ask him if someone was hot.. and i asked jerod about it, and he said y'all were talkin about me.."" he said, ""yeah.. our plan was to say that it was hot in there..but that didn't really work out.."" but ne ways...
     kevin (youth leader) and jason (helps bro. elton with the younger kids) were askin if ne of us (that were on the van for a ride home) played ne instruments.. they're wanting to put together a band.. i think that would b kewl.. i told them that jerod plays the guitar.. and evan is tryin to get a drum set cuz they're tryin to start a band.. i'll let y'al know how the youth band is goin..
     now... let's move on to thursday....
     every morning... me, cara, meagan, kristie, jessica and sometimes kayce walk around the school.. just cuz we're bored... well.. we were walkin.. and derden was standin there against the stairs.. and meagan decides to push me onto derden!! it was awful.. when i ""hit him"" he said, ""you best check yourself!!"" it was funny when he said that...but otherwise.. it was awful...
     then.. in 2nd pd... i have P.E... and when they released us to go change back into our school clothes, kayce hid my clothes... so.. i was just about to go around school in my P.E. clothes!! that woulda been alright... but they were kinda sweaty.. so that woulda been kinda nasty... but ne ways... she put them in a locker before i got into the locker room... it was bad..
     then... when we got back in the gym and waited for the bell to ring.. jerid came up to me and meagan and slapped us.. meagan grabbed kearstin's shoe.. and threw it at jerid... well... i grabbed kearstin's other shoe and tried to throw it at jerid... but.. i kinda missed jerid and i hit jamie in the head... it was soo funny... 
      and then... at lunch.. kristie got a slushie.. well.. she was blowin in the straw..and she didn't realise that the slushie would come up and splash her.. so... meagan kinda scared her.. and that made her blow even harder into the straw.. and it got on her shirt... so.. she went to go get some napkins to clean it with.. and while she was gone.. meagan put some of her slushie in her seat... and she sat in it!!! it was hilarious... 
     OMG... i tried to trip cara while she wa goin to lunch.. and i almost fell instead of her.. it was funny.. cuz there was a lot of ppl in the hallway... 
      in algebra class.. anthony and ryan persuaded me to try to wear one of my button that i put on my purse for earrings... it wouldn't go in.. and it started to hurt.. so i gave up... lol..
     then... in my spanish class... allye looked out the window, and she asked me, ""where r we?"" and i was like.. ""in the back of the school.."" and she said... ""oh.. ok.. sorry.. i didn't know where we were... it just looks like a totally different world back here.."" or somethin like that... 
    i kinda got in a lil bit of trouble... hannah was over at my house.. and i was cookin tacos.. i needed some cookin oil for the refried beans...well... autumn was over here too... and she was all like, ""we have some oil at my house!!"" and so i asked them if they would go over there real fast to get some so we could eat... well.. hannahwasn't supposed to go over to autumn's..so she was callin her mom to see if she could just go over there to get some oil... well... she couldn't get a hold of her... so she just went... then.. while she was gone...her mom called and said that she was comin to get hannah.... so i had to run over to autumn's house to get them... but... i didn't get to her in time.. and her mom was there by the time that she got there...so she was in trouble... and then my dad said that i couldn't have ne one over... so.. ya.. hannah got grounded for 2 weeks...
     now.. we're on to friday.... in P.E.... i was tryin to do my spanish homework... and i was kinda sittin underneath a basketball goal.. but not exactly under it.. and this dude... he was playin b-ball with some other dudes..and the ball was comin my way... and he was runnin to get it... and he kicked my knee... and... that caused him to trip... so he kinda landed on me... i now have a bruise on my knee.... 
     idk what to get matt for valentine's day.. i asked this one dude... and he said that i should get him a watch.. but idk... if u have ne comments on what i should get him... post 'em... please!!
     well... ne ways.. i guess i should get goin... i'll write y'al later... bye bye!!

     OMG... Dalila got married!! that is sooo sweet.... his name is hector.. but that's pretty much all i know about him.. except that he has a red firebird... it's pretty nice looking.. but ne ways... 
     Ms. Brewer busted her knuckle yesterday... idk what she was getting.. but she was tryin to reach something in her little cabinet... (her and her short self)... and then... she almost said a ""potty word"" but refused to say it... lol... but ne ways.. that was one.. of the many highlights of the day... 
     i'm gonna have bruises all over my legs.. like around my knees.. because... spencer is mean.. and he keeps hittin me.. well.. not really hitting me.. but... like.. lightly slapping my arm.. so i try to kick him back cuz i can't reach him by hitting him.. soo.. i try to kick him.. and i forget about the bar on the desk.. and i keep kickin it instead of him.. and it hurts... badly..
     yesterday.. me and meagan got a ride to my house from preston.. and he has a truck... and he made us ride in the bed of the truck... and he was goin too fast on a curve... and i went backwards.. and i almost did a backwards rolling flip... it kinda hurt.. but not as bad as when i hit my hand...
     i was tryin to wave at somebody we were passing on the way home... and i was too close to the inside of the bed of the truck.. and i hit the part that kinda hovers over it.. u know?? and now i have a bruise below my knuckles on my middle and ring finger on my right hand... it was funny.. but OMG it hurt... 
     then.. i finally got to talk to matt for more that 5 minutes.. it was cool.. i told him that this past sunday was 3 months.... and he was like.. ""3 months for what?"" and i said, ""for how long we've been together..."" and he said..""nu uh.. for real?? it doesn't even seem like that long... "" i was like.. ""i know.. but it has been..""  
     AND NOW FOR TODAY!!!
     not a whole lot happened today... but.. meagan straightened my hair in P.E.... it looks perdy.. lol.. 
     in 5th pd. i used ryan's sharpies on my hair.. i put a few green streaks in my bangs.. and a couple of black ones.. and then.. i tried this yellow one.. but.. you can't really see the yellow.. but u can see the green.. i'm gonna put some more green in when i get home.. cuz it looks really kewl.. lol.. but ne ways... 
     omg.. there's this chik named carrie in my P.E. class... and she's a big time prep... and she was sayin in the locker room.. ""i'm soo hungry... i'm starving my brains out.."" and when she said that.. i thought... ""well.. if you would actually spend some of that money you get on food instead of accessories and crap like that.. then u wouldn't be so fricken hungry..."" 
    the other day... (i wasn't here to witness it... but meagan told me about it...) carrie and josh were arguin about somethin.. and carrie made a smart a** remark to josh and josh goes... ""yeah, well so r u... but we don't complain about it.."" and carrie said, ""yeah.. well.. you're just jealous cuz my hair's better than yours!!""  i wish i coulda been there.. i woulda been laughin my butt off.. but ne ways...
     omg.. keaton is bein sooo stupid.. there's this thing on the computer.. that he's typing stuff in.. and the computer is sayin it... and he keeps puttin stuff in.. but it can't say things that you type in.. so.. you have to make up a different spelling for things.. and he was thinking of how to put, ""mrs. ingersoll is a party animal..""  mrs. ingersoll asked him how he figured out how to make it soo clear.. and he said, ""i had to think like a computer there for a minute...""  then he paused for a few seconds... and then he said..""it kinda hurts... the little hamsters that r up in my head were running like 100 miles per hour.."" it was funny.. i'm sure you woulda been laughin if you woulda been here...it was really funny... he was makin it say, ""yeah"" like lil jon would say it.. and it sounded sooo funny.. but ne ways...
     that's all i got for now.. except for that i'm gettin a new computer in a couple of weeks.. i'm soo excited.. but... right now.. we don't have ne internet at home.. cuz.. my dad is late payin the bill...so.. i have to do all this stuff here at school... but ne ways... 
     i guess i had better get back to work.. NOT!! i'm gonna check my mail.. i'll try to write tomorrow!! bye!!

"event","OMG... i've had an eventful weekend.. today is mine and matt's 3 month.. and yesterday i had sooo much fun!! 
     i went to a KMM (Kick Me Mafia) concert... they're awesome!! they opened for a band call Bliss... they were cool too.. i got the Bliss CD.. i woulda got KMM's CD but.. they weren't selling them.. BUMMER! but ne ways.. me and meagan went.. there was a bunch of ppl we knew there... there was only like 3 or 4 people there that wasn't from princeton... but crawford, jake, kearstin, garrett, bridgett, jennifer, derek, kenny, chris, veronica, jessica, angela, the carmona brothers,nathan, korey, and a bunch of other ppl were there.. we were rockin out and just havin a good time..i was soo stupid tho.. because.. they had a raffle.. and i got a pepsi t-shirt... and after the show.. me and meagan went back to where the people were to get autographs...and instead of them signing the shirt.. i had them sign the waterbottle.. lol..
     but ne ways..  i'm gonna try to go back maybe not this saturday... or the one after that.. but maybe the one after that.. idk.. i might go this saturday since i have this bake auction the one after next... but ne ways.. 
     enough about that.. friday.. me and meagan went to the movies.. we saw white noise.. it wasn't all that great.. this one part got me good.. i think pretty much everyone that was in there screamed... meagan screamed and didn't realise it.. it was funny... that she screamed and didn't know it.. not the part in the movie.. cuz it was scary.. not funny.. but ne ways.. i'm rambling... lol.. we saw randy, trent, and stephanie at the movies.. they were going to watch some other movie.. but.. after they bought the tickets, they decided they didn't wanna watch that movie.. but they couldn't get their money back.. so randy just came to see white noise w/ me and meagan... 
     then my brother called me in the middle of the movie.. i told him i would call him back.. then i finally called him back yesterday.. then.. he said that he would call me back sometime later that day.. and he never did.. 
     o.. friday night.. i stayed the night over at cara's.. i was helping her babysit... i got there at like 11 at night.. cuz our movie started at 8... and my dad wasn't off when our movie was over.. cuz he had to close the store.. so.. he didn't get up to the movies to get us until 10:30 or 10:45.. then we had to go back to my house so i could get a few things... then we took meagan home.. and then i got to cara's.. the kids were already asleep.. but.. for some reason.. cara got mikaela up... then.. mikaela was layin with me in the chair and she fell asleep... then she woke up.. and got on the other couch.. and then... i fell asleep.. so did cara.. BUT... domingo called and woke us up!! i couldn't get back to sleep in the chair.. so cara traded places with me.. i still couldn't get back to sleep.. cuz domingo was makin me sing.. i DO NOT sing good when i'm tired... or halfway alseep..  so he was laughing at me.. i finally went back to sleep.. ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER!!
     and then came saturday... i tried to take a shower at cara's..but.. her bathtub was stopped up.. so i had to take a quick shower.. and i'm not good at taking quick showers cuz i don't get all the shampoo and conditioner out... then.. right after i got out of the shower.. my dad came to pick me up.. and at that time.. kiyton was throwin a fit on the floor.. so i picked him up and was holding him.. he was tired.. that's what was wrong with him.. so i took him in the living room.. and was tryin to rock him to sleep.. but KNOCK! KNOCK!... there was my dad.. so i gave him back to cara.. hopefully he finally went to sleep.. and now cara's not feeling well... POOR CARA!!
     today... omg.. was sooo much fun.. after church.. my dad's girlfriend, jessica, took me and her daughter, autumn, to the stonebriar mall.. (a.k.a. the Frisco mall).. and i had a blast... i got one of those beaded things that go infront of your door.. i forgot what it's called... but it's a greyish color.. with a stop sign on it.. it's cool.. and... i got some green and pink shoelaces for my pink and green converse shoes... o.. and i got a new cover for my cell phone.. it's pink.. but it's see thru.. i tried to get a black one.. but.. it was messed up.. so the dude let me get a different one.. and.. the see thru just made it look soooo awesome.. and the pink was the only other see thru one.. so yeah.. i got some new earrings.. they're the dangling kind.. they've got orange dice on them... they're awesome.. they go with my orange and white phat farms and my ""orange outfit"".. lol.. i also got some keychains... one is a pair of pink ""finger cuffs"".. they're soo cute.. lol.. and the other says, ""i'm in my one world, but it's okay because everyone knows me here"" or something like that.. then.. i got some of those pins that say stuff on them.. one is a happy bunny.. and it says, ""i'm bad and you like it"" another one says, ""i hate you"" and the other says...  ""i get checked out more often than a book at the library""   autumn got some magnetic earrings.. she had them on the top of her ear.. then she thought... ""i should put one on my nose and have a nose ring"" then she was scared the magnet part would get stuck in her nose.. that woulda been funny.. so.. she ended up not having a ""nose ring""... she tried a ""lipring"".. and it didn't work.. it kept falling off.. lol.. so she just had 3 on the top of her right ear.. and one on her left ear.. lol.. but ne ways.. jessica got the top of her ear pierced.. really.. it's not magnetic.. lol.. I GOT ME SOME DIPPIN' DOTS!! those r soooo good... lol.. i almost got some Kirra cologne.. i LOVE that smell.. it smells soooo good...
     omg.. i just remembered that today was the super bowl!! lol.. but ne ways.. i don't care too much for football.. i watched the halftime show though.. it was alright... it was cool how they had that blue swirly thing.. and then everybody had a blue glowstick.. lol.. but ne ways...
     while i was trying to get my cover put on my cell phone.. the dude that was doing it.. said he smelled beer.. and right before this.. me and autumn put some green hair-spray in our hair.. and it didn't smell quite like roses.. since now.. apparently.. roses really smell like.. well.. nevermind.. not gonna go there.. but ne ways... he said, ""i smell beer.."" i said.. ""oh.. that's my hair.. i just put this green in"" and he said, ""o.. i thought it was something.. but you're underage.. so i wasn't sure if it was someone else or what... where did you get it done?"" i told him, ""it's just hairspray.. it just washes out.."" i think i made him feel a lil stupid.. lol...
     o.. and on the way out... there was this dude in the parking lot... and he kept yelling, ""wooo!!!"" and finally.. i yelled out, ""woo!"" and he yelled it.. and i yelled it again.. and he yelled, ""woo!! you're hair's awesome! woo!"" and i was like, ""woo.. thanks.. woo.."" lol.. it was soo funny.. then.. we drove by him as we were leaving.. and we put the top down on the mustang (cuz we took my dad's car) and his door was open.. so i yelled ""woo!!"" lol.. but ne ways..
     that's pretty much it.. and now i'm here.. writing this... i know it's a lil ""out of order"" but that's how most of these things are going to be because.. i'm just like that.. i'll think of one thing.. and then something else will pop in my head... and i'll write that.. but ne ways..
     me and matt almost broke up the other day... i hadn't talked to him in a while.. cuz he was either gone.. or no one would answer.. so.. i finally got a hold of him.. and i talked to him about it.. i said, ""answer this honestly.. do you still want to be with me?"" and he said, ""i don't know.. cuz i hardly ever get to see you..."" i said.. ""i know.. we hardly talk either.."" and he said, ""yeah.. i mean.. i still like you and all if that's what you're asking.."" i just sat there... i was tryin not to cry on the phone.. cuz i was soo scared that he was going to break up with me.. and thank goodness.. he didn't... but.. he asked if i would call him back.. so i did.. around 10:30.. and we talked about it some more.. and after like 2 minutes of silence.. he finally said, ""i guess we still go out... but it's gonna be hard because of my football practice.. we practice all year round... and even on the weekends..."" so.. this is gonna b some weird relationship.. i mean.. if living in different states wasn't hard enough.. now he's got football practice all year.. hopefully we'll make it tho.. cuz i really like him.. ok.. maybe more than like... i love him... 
     i think there's something special about us.. i mean.. the night i met him.. i was attracted to him.. and he was to me.. cuz.. the next night.. he called from a skate park... he was callin everyone he knew that knew my mom's boyfriend.. and he couldn't get it from them.. so.. he finally thought about getting the phone book and looking it up.. then.. once he found the number.. he was scared to call.. so.. this lil dude that was at the skate park dialed the number and asked for me.. and then.. he gave the phone to matt... and after like.. 10 minutes of being on the phone.. he asked me out.. then.. the 2nd night we were goin out.. we kissed.. and on the 3rd night.. he told me he loved me... he told me that the night he met me.. he went home and couldn't stop thinking about me.. he's sooo sweet!! he said it was like... not love at first sight.. but when he saw me.. he knew he would like me.. and that's how i felt..
     we were at patty and david's house (friend's of my mom's boyfriend, mike).. they were having this cook-out type thing.. but... the only teenagers there was me, cara, greg, and matt... at first.. me and cara thought that matt was josh.. but it turned out that it wasn't.. but matt and josh are cousins.. but ne ways.. i noticed that matt kept looking at me.. greg was grounded at the time.. but he only lived like a block away.. so me, cara, and matt walked him home... it was dark outside (cuz it was at night) and they live out in the country where there's woods.. but ne ways.. i was a lil scared.. cara was holdin on to greg's arm.. but she doesn't remeber much.. she got ""a lil tipsy"" off of some ""wine coolers"".. but.. she was hanging on to greg.. then matt said, ""if you want to.. you can link arms with me.. i don't mind"" but.. he said it sincerely.. he didn't say it like he was hitting on me or ne thang... so.. i linked arms with cara.. and after a while.. i linked arms with him.. we stopped in the middle of the road and we were talkin to greg before he went in.. then.. on the way back.. i linked arms with matt... so did cara.. i wasn't scared at this point.. cuz i thought that since nothin happened on the walk there.. nothin would happen on the walk back.. but.. as we got close to patty and david's.. somethin like fell out of a tree.. and you could hear it.. so.. i got really scared.. i think matt did too.. i know cara did.. lol.. but ne ways.. my arm was linked with him until we started walkin up the driveway.. he said that at one point, he was going to grab my hand.. but he didn't want me to slap him.. i told him that i wouldnt' have... 
     then..when we were back in the house.. cara was layin on the couch.. and we had put in a movie.. matt was sittin on the couch right beside the TV and cara was layin beside him.. but was facin away from him. i guess you would put it that way... but ne ways.. i was sittin on the floor in front of the TV... and i had this bracelet on.. it had lil red lips dangling off of it.. and i was throwing it at cara... just to bother her.. and everytime i threw it at her.. she would pick it up.. and give it to matt.. then matt would give it to me.. but he would hand it to me slowly.. and he would make it to where i would have to get close to his hand to get it.. he said he was going to grab my hand then too.. but.. he didn't.. then.. we had to go home.. it was a fun night.. i'm glad it happened.."

i havent looked at this since july 23 last year.
its sunday morning. maybe ive been thoughtless since then. or maybe i have been all knowing. this was usually a way for me to ask questions content that i wouldnt get the answers. i am not that person anymore i suppose.

ive learned alot since then. im writting this down for myself now. because i know none of the people that will see this matter to me anymore or give a shit about me. i put my faith into myself now. i cant walk around with other peoples in me. no one has any.


really the only reason im writing in this is to look back on this in twenty years when its just a digital graveyard of what we all used to be and not have to remember it just as dark days.


im moving into a new house in a little over a month.
and starting another chapter.
im getting married
uhhmm
going on tour
ruining my life with tattoos
living the dream pretty much

thats all.
there are a few of you i still care about.
even if you dont."

i camped in hilton.
had the hardest time getting to sleep.
im completely fucked for money.
like FUUUUUUUUUCKEEEEDDDDD.
hahaha
but its okay. im pretty much the happiest ive been in a long time right now. and i wont ever let anything like this happen to me again.
which rules im glad that i realized it finally. im going to buy some land soon and start building my own place.
which will probably be the first time i'll feel like ive really accomplished something great.

also i love NCDSBU!
shit is so much fun.
40 dudes shooting fireworks at a bunch of canadian fucking faggotz.
i got to hang with bucky and sing with him last night.
all the beef is over. 
ashley is going to be here in two weeks. which kinda snuck up on me quick. hopefully ill have some money then so we can actually do things. but i think she'll be broke too after the 300 dollar plane ticket."

everything just took a huge turn for the better.

my apartment(slash the most down to earth understanding landlord(slumlord) ever)

"event","<center> recent days have given me a new understanding of the way the world works.
at this point im a little worried. things in every aspect of my life have basically began crumbling before me.
i can see mistakes ive made but ive done nothing (in my eyes) to deserve whats been put on my plate lately.
i dont want to be worried anymore. i already know whats happening. and its not making me sad anymore. which kind of in some way makes it so much worse. i dont want to start over. i dont want to lose what ive tried so hard to have. i feel like ive thought about other people for so long that i dont know how to think about myself. i dont want to lose my best friend. or my apartment. or my grandma. i know i can be difficult sometimes.. but before anything is put in stone lay down in bed tonight and think about it. growing up is hard. but its harder with no one behind you.

no more sketchy.
or friends dissapearing. 
or shitty jobs.
or having doubts about things. 
i neeed someone to be here for me right now and no one is.
i know all the people who stopped being my friend for no reason will pass over this like i dont exist. 
but seriously.. ifi havent done enough then get fucked. i can think of like three people who have helped me out ever. maybe a few more. im sick of getting shit on.
this is in no way me being sad. i just want my life back. the way it was please.
or leave me alone forever."

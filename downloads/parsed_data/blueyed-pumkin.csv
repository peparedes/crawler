"event","i am finally back where civil human contact is possible by something other than a cell phone... although i did have an awesome time at the beach! I am now sixteen.(not feeling a big difference. not that i thought i would though) and according to my parents i am now allowed to date. Not that they ever had to tell me no before.i am sooo jealous that you got like four feet of snow! i hope to see everyone sometime within like the next couple of months because my dad moves up in march and my parents said i am going to be up there to get my permit once my dad is settled! Hooray i am one step closer to legally being allowed to drive!"

"event","I have probably the first good news ive had in weeks
i am coming back for the crystal ball (jan 14) and i think i am bringing a friend with me so you all get to see what i have to put up with daily i miss you all sooo much i went to homecoming last friday and it was all about dancing with your date not with your friends. 
I am soo sick and tired of always being on the verge of tears cause all of the sudden things like oh my god my friends aren't here to do stupid things with me and i hate how here it is all about boyfriends.
for a date you go w/... boyfriend. Dance... boyfriend. Etc. 
best part of all this was i ended up dancing with a gay guy for one of the slow dances. Doesn't that make me feel wanted."

"event","sometimes i think...no i rephrase that i know that i have a more mature view of life than most of the people around me. I think that this has given me a very cynical view of life in general and i try to act like im happy and paint that happy picture that i know everyone wants to see. But then i break down at random times...never in school or in public where my pretty painting would be shattered like many a piece of pottery in my house... but when im doing my homework alone in my room or with you guys at a sleepover. i become the teenager that is truly what grownups paint teenagers to be, emo and only caring about superficial things. and no matter how many times i tell my parents ""no no its fine that i have never been asked out i don't want to go through that inevitable breakup, especially not in high school where things are dramatic enough"" and they reassure me that i probably intimidate boys and they think that ""nah she won't go out with me"" its hard not to think that im not pretty or whatever.i try to deny it i really do...but what i want most lately..is a boyfriend"

"event","ughh.... i get home from school (where there is like no free time because they believe that if they left us alone for more than the time it takes to eat we are all going to smoke in the bathrooms) i have to study for SAT's and do my application for the North Carolina School of Math and Sciences. Which has taken me the last like three days and im still not done. Is it worth it??? i mean if i get in and manage not to get kicked for like swearing or something stupid like that ( i said ""damn it"" kinda loud in one of my classes yesterday and my friend was like you might want to be a little quieter cause they'll get mad. i was like What!?!?) the school will pay my full tuition for any college in the state. But is it worth it? i feel like school doesn't go away after 3:30 like it should. oh well i guess that's what project runway and america's next top model is for."

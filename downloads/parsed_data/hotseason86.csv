"event","so this morning i had the toughest time getting up for work.  i was so exhausted, i almost called to see if i could just sleep in and come after lunch, but no i went.  and i was tired most of the day but whatever it was fine.  then i came home had dinner watched some tv, took a bath, read my book, cuz ya know i didn't want to go to sleep too early and throw off my schedule or whatever.  so at a decent time, like maybe 10:30pm i decide to hit the sack.  can't fall asleep. (gee that seems sort of 'metal-y' doesn't) read more.  can't fall asleep.  read more and finish the damn book. can't fall asleep.  so here i am writing in this stupid thing at 1:46 am when i have to be up at 7 am to get my dad from the airport.  super.   ......................................  sorry i know my life could obviously be much horrifically worse just needed to vent."

"event","What are you afraid of?

Feel lame to be using the writer's block, but I'm bored and I only have 20 minutes left till I can leave work.  Don't have much to do here.

So fears... obvious one that lots of people know about is bugs (specifically ones that bite/sting, or are just really creepy looking) - I can't stand them, depending on the situation sometimes I freak out pretty bad too.  Most recently I started crying after realizing the bug that followed me inside was not a moth, but a wasp and was sitting on my shoulder.  After probably 15 minutes I had finally killed the thing and was able to start calming down.  Its something that I don't like about myself cuz with my personality I feel that I'm not someone who would lose it over something as small as an insect, but I can't help it.  Don't know where I got it from, maybe growing up in a suburb and never having to deal with it much, but who knows...

A fear that people may not know cuz its not like its something thats discussed often, is I have a fear of finding a dead body.  I probably wouldn't feel very comfortable around a dead body even if I was warned before hand, but its specifically finding one.  Sounds weird I know but it comes from stupid scary movies and stuff.  Its not like I've ever lived it an area where that is a likely possibility (although Judd did tell me that a body was found in the creek very close to our house 10 years ago or something...).

Eh well its almost time to go know so thats it.  But hey if anyone reads this, what are afraid of?"

"event","Hi again!

Here are pictures from my weekend in Venice and my short trip to Salisbury and Stonehenge(I put them at the end of one of my Turkey albums)

Venice was great!  It was very packed though, apparently it was a bank holiday or something for Italy that weekend.  We really enjoyed walking through Venice and finding the not tourist-y parts. It was really quiet and peaceful.  We did breakdown and get a gondala ride, but we talked down the price to almost half of what they said first.

Salisbury was a neat town to see.  Very much the typical English town (btw if you've seen Hot Fuzz it totally made me think of that movie, haha, if you haven't seen it then SEE IT).  Stonehenge was impressive.  Some people complain that it's just a bunch of rocks in a field, but it's more than that.  I enjoyed getting to see it.

London's May Day was this past monday and of course thats when it decided to start raining.  We tried to see some of the May Day events but nothing was happening.  It's been so cold this week, in the low 50's, I think I'm going to faint when that Texas heat hits me this Saturday!

I'm going to miss London, but I'm ready to come home.  I'm going to miss the big city, being able to get around so easily, having so many things to do and see.  I'm not going to miss being packed onto a tube train car like a sardine, or blowing my nose and it being black just from walking outside.  And I'm looking forward to being back in the States and being able to expect good service when I go to a restuarant, getting a big good salad and having a choice of dressings, and being able to take home my leftovers!  I'm looking forward to driving(on the right side of the road), playing with my dog, and not having to pay twice as much for things.  Of course I'm going to miss the friends that I've made here, but most of them go to Hollins so I'll see them in the fall.  I have closer friends, and of course my family!, that I miss back home.

Hope you all enjoy the pictures and I will be seeing some of you very soon!

Cheers!
Summer"

"event","So about a month ago my mom, dad, and brother came and visited me here in London.  It was great to see them!  Even though my brother got sick and my dad got really sick.  Anyways, they came along to some of my class trips and my brother and I went to the London Dungeon.  It's kind of like a haunted house, but the guides tell you gross or scary historical facts about London, and they tell you about some myths too.  Here's Judd with one of the guides

After Prague Ashley came and visited me!!!  The first thing we did was go to speakers corner.  Every Sunday people come out to speak about anything they want to (usually its about religion or the War in Iraq, but sometimes other stuff too), the corner was designated to honor free speech.  This guy was trying to talk about how language is limited and cannot express real truth(or something like that).

We also visited the Tower of London and saw the crown jewels, which included a 156k diamond!!!  Here we are with a Yeoman or Beefeater in traditional dress

We ate a great Indian Restuarant that night, a few girls went streaking on a rugby field, and Amelia and I stole our pillows from the Hilton :) It was a good trip.   Before we went back to London we visited the most amazing garden that was a part of this ginormous estate -

"event","so i'm still loving it in London! no surprise i guess.  we've had two weeks of classes and so far they are all great, except for Media but it's not too bad.  in my Modern European Art class (by far my favorite) we go to a museum every week to look at the artwork we discussed in the previous class (amazing!).  the teacher is awesome and knows her stuff.  Britian through the Middle Ages is cool so far.  the class is once a week for 3 hours, but the first hour and a half is lecture and the second half we go and visit someplace.  so far we've been to the Roman ampitheatre and the Museum of London.  the political science teacher is hilarious and doesn't mind when class goes off in random directions (we were talking about lent one day and somehow ended up talking about marriage and divorce).  by the way did you know that citizens of the UK have no protected rights?(like we have the right to free speech, and pursuit happiness etc.)  seriously, they don't.  isn't that weird?  and Media...well right now we are talking about reality tv, my least favorite subject, so it should get better once we move onto the next thing.  although apparently reality tv is a bit more real than i thought.

the first two weeks me and the other hollins students went out a LOT, and i've had to decide that i don't need to be going out so much, especially during the week.  plus everything is so expesive here! if something is $10 is the US it will be 10 pounds in the UK, but 10 pounds is about $20!  the fun part about going out is how easy it is to meet guys(although this is coming from a girl who attends an all women college).  i've meet a few but no one in particular yet.  there was the scottish guy that didn't call, american guy that turned out to be an asshole, canadian guy that i couldn't understand what he said, and brazilian guy that tried to bite off my entire mouth when he kissed me, not cool.  it's actually kind of hard to meet english ppl just because of how easy it is to meet ppl at ISH.  guess i'll just have to try harder.

anyways, i'm going out shopping with Ameila today.  we are going to Camden Town, this crazy, huge market place where they have everything and anything that is not conventional or common.  and then maybe over to Oxford Street for a little traditonal shopping. i hope everyone is doing well.   i do miss home and Hollins though, so any messages are greatly appreciated.

"event","I'm here!!!!  After a delayed flight, missing a flight, and another delayed flight I finally made it to London!  I've moved into the International Student House(ISH) in the Maryleborne area.  Katie, my new roommate who is also from Hollins, is really cool.  We are getting along very well.
 
The first night we ate in a pub across the street called The Albany.  It was ok, but I really liked the relaxed atmosphere.  So far pubs are definately my style.  That night the dorm was having a Superbowl Party, which was absolutely crazy.  It was so packed there were actually times where could literally not move, but it was fun.  
 
The next day we started orientation.  Things we'ved talked about this week are how to get around, safety, travel, and differences between England and the US(don't say fanny unless you know what it means).  We've also done a bus tour of London and a highlights tour of the British Museum(which was AMAZING, can't wait to go back).  Today we were supposed to go to Windsor Castle, but get this- there is less then 1cm of snow on the ground and the trains are shut down. I can't believe it.  My friends and I are talking about going to Windsor Castle tomorrow ourselves, depending on the weather.
 
Oh so there are 16 people in the Hollins London Abroad Program, 15 girls from Hollins and one guy from Hampton Sydney.  The other people from Hollins/Hampton Sydney who are living in ISH with me are Katie(roommate), Lucy, Eve, Lizzie, Sarah, and George.  They are all awesome and we are having a fun time hanging out.  Tuesday for lunch we went to this really cool Sushi place.  You sit at your table and a conveyer belt goes by with all these little dishes of food on them and you just grab what you want.  The dishes are color coded for price.  It was really good, but expensive.  That night we found a really cool pub near Piccadilly Circus, where the bartender was nice for once, and later we went to an Irish club/pub located in Chinatown(weird I know).  I met a hot scottish guy there ;) who was really nice, I might hang out with him this weekend.  Last night Katie and I tried to go to an event held by London Metropoliton University(she's taking a class there) but it turned out to be a Disco, which we weren't prepared for.  I much prefer the pubs where you can actually hear ppl talking and the atmosphere is so relaxed.  So we just left and went back to ISH. Tonight everyone is excited about Kareokee night at ISH.  I let you all know how it goes!

So far I love living in the city, it's so easy to get around and there is SO much to do!!!  And there are so many beautiful parks in this city too.  I can't wait for a nice day to go walk around.  Anyways this is getting long so I will update again later.  Hope everyone is doing well!"

"event","OMG it's Winter in Dallas!! Freak out!  So I understand its important for people in the area to know that hey the roads are iced over, be careful, so they might want to mention this on the weather and traffic parts of the news, but it's ALL they're talking about.   And it's not just on the local news, it was on the Today Show.  I'm pretty sure everyone in the far north that experiences REAL ice and snow everyday of winter is having a good laugh at us.  I mean seriously we've had ice before, it usually happens at least once every winter, why is this time such a big deal?

It is pretty cold though, and I read Megan's note on facebook that she couldn't even get into her car this mornig because the lock was literally frozen!  But we've still had worse before.

Anyways, internship is going well, the shit doesn't seem to be hitting the fan, and i got some cool shoes this weekend.  So all in all life's good."

"event","ok, so i've decided this J-term internship will definately be my last internship since I don't seem to have the best luck with internships.

1st internship - marketing intern for the National Alliance for Autism Research, NAAR, North Texas office.  Turned out all I did were those things Hollins tells us cannot count for an internship, making copies, filing, mailing stuff, etc.  It was still fun, and it was how I meet the two people that led to my next two internships, but I was not able to get credit for it and I didn't get paid either.

Next J-term - Internship at UT Southwest Medical Center in with a Psych professor doing research on creating an animal model similar to animals with autism.  Sounds good right?  Except for maybe 3 days out of that whole internship I spent then entire month on a...i don't remember the name of the thing, but it's a machine that cuts REALLY thin slices of whatever you want, so you can put them on a slide, and keeps is really freezing cold at the same time.  So that means I spent the WHOLE month slicing mouse brains!  Now brains are cool and all for the first few days, but a whole month? no.

Current J-term - Internship at ARTS for People (Art & Recreational Therapuetic Solutions), following and assisting different therapist.  Now this one may turn out to be cool, but I would know seeing as I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET!!!  I don't know my schedule, I know of a few sessions they do in Ft. Worth(at least an hours drive away) but I don't know if I'm just supposed to show up or what.  They knew I was to start on Wed., but I didn't hear anything from them so I e-mailed them Wed. morning.  Heard for them and they told me about some stuff, but not what to do, and said they'd e-mail me the complete schedule that day(Wed.) or Thursday.  It's friday and I have yet to receive any such e-mail.  They say they are busy and so I don't want to be rude by pestering them, but I guess we'll see how it goes.

So yeah, no more internships for me.  But to end on a good note, my break went pretty well and I hope everyone elses did too!  Happy New Year!"

"event","so judd and i had lunch today and on the tv's at the restuarant they had the england vs someone i don't remember soccer game on.  this lead judd to talk about how boring soccer is, how for 90 min. each team only scores 1 or 2 times.  so today he created the new and improved soccer, with a little help from me.

first off, there are 50 guys on each team, and all 100 guys are on the field at once.  to make things more interesting 20 players on each team are blindfolded, and 5 players on each team are under 5 ft. tall- these short players originally were midgets but judd decided it'd be hard to find midgets with the kind of athletic ability needded for new and improved soccer, so we're thinking jockey type guys.  anyways these short players have on velcro suits and the ball is some kind of fuzzy material that sticks to velcro(started out as steel ball with guys wearing magnetic suits, but judd realized how painful it would be to kick a steel ball).  now the short guys still can't touch the ball with their hands, in fact their hands are trapped inside the velcro suits to prevent that, but if they get the ball stuck to them and run into the goal that is a goal for their team.  also the goals randomly change during the game, meaning you could make it all the way down to the other end of the field where your goal was, and then it changed to the other goal being yours.  when judd made this rule i pointed out that making goals would happen as often as it does now in soccer, which was his original complaint, so another rule was added, the short players can run into a goal and by doing so makes it their team's goal(this is also when one midget turned into 5, and then into 5 short guys).  i also pointed out that it would be hard to make it to either goal with all those guys on the field and thats when he added the 20 blindfolded ppl thing.  

i think that's it, oh and angry badgers are randomly let loose on the field during the game.

oh and everyone has stun guns.

and he still wants to call it soccer.

yeah i know, we're special, but we like it that way."

"event","Jake broke up with me yesterday.

we're supposedly going to be friends though and stay in touch(i say supposedly because of what happened with Max)

basically he did it for two main reasons 1. he thinks its unfair to me to make me wait while he's gone for so long.  he'll be in california for training for sept. and oct., then he goes home for thanksgiving, then for Christmas, then again for his time off before leaving for Iraq.  plus depending on where they go in iraq he might not be able to contact anyone for the whole year he is gone.  also he said that he might come home 'fucked up' or not come home at all and he doesn't want to put me through that. i told him that he can't ""make me wait"" that its my choice, but he still had other reasons-

2. he found out last thursday that another unit has gone to the part of iraq his unit was supposed to go to, so now his unit is probably going to Fascia, one of the worst parts of Iraq, the one they've been talking about in the news a lot.  he says that if we stay together we'll get stronger feelings for each other and then he'll get depressed as it comes closer to the time he has to leave, that then he won't want to go, and he worries that while he's over there he'll mess up and get someone else or himself killed.  he said that he needs to get into the mind set that he's going to war, that he might not come back and that he needs to focus on his training.

what sucks is that there's no way for me to really understand this reasoning.  even if i can't see him or talk to him, its better to me to know that we are together.  he said over and over that he knows this will be better for the future, for in the long run, and that he wants to be friends.

i hate that it has to be this way, but i know there is no way for me to change his mind.  i think he's really starting to worry about iraq and i can't do anything to help him with that, and it sucks.  it all sucks."

"event","I'm HOME! So exciting!  Even though it's been really weird getting used to be home again I can't help but feel happy that I'm in Dallas again.

My parents are being as odd as ever, all of sudden we eat dinner together every night and not in front of the TV, good change I guess just weird.  And in the 3 days that I've been home I haven't found a job yet - gasp! - which my dad is kind enough to constantly remind me of.  I wish he could talk to me about other things, I feel like we used to but maybe that's just me hoping that we used to talk about things other than work, school, and money.

Thankfully my friends are just the same.  You'd think Brittany R. would be this changed person after spending a semester in India, which I'm sure she has some new perspective and all that but, she's just the same Brittany R. I knew before.  Everyone else I've seen so far has been the same.  O but David, Brittany's older brother who I used to be friends with too, is as weird as ever.  He has this girlfriend he's crazy about which is good, but is over the top about it sometimes.  Anyways we were watching the Mavericks game and Sarah(his girlfriend) comes over and he points to me and says ""See that girl Sarah, I asked her out once, and you know what she said? She said no.""  Ok I was shocked because not only have we never talked about how David and I almost dated but the fact that he was bringing it up in front of his girlfriend and that THAT NEVER HAPPENED. He never ever straight out asked me out.  I told him this, but he still claims that he asked me to be his girlfriend and that I said no, but if he had asked I would of said yes(so thank God it never happened).  Anyways so I say isn't he glad we didn't date because now he has Sarah(not that we would of dated for that long but just to get me out of this awkward situation)  and he says ""Well then it would of been you, then Kelley, then Terry, Shannon, Kristy, AND then Sarah""(I don't remember all the names but it was at least 4 or 5).  I was like !!!!!!  ""So I would of been a name on a list?!?""  David- ""Yes, many girls wish they were on that list.""  Yeah whatever David, you keep thinking that.  Anyways Jes put it best when she called David a cocky asshole.  The funny thing is my brother never liked David even when we were just friends, so from now on I only date guys my brother likes(and btw I think my brother will like Jake :) ).

So that was my weirdest thing to happen so far since I've been home, but the summer's only begun.  Cross your fingers that I find a good job!

P.S. Sunny made it all the way home and is happily swimming around in his tank!! Yay for miracle fish!"

and no one can get me out

not even me

so i guess i'll just have to live in a hole



if this doesn't make sense don't worry about it,
if it does make sense don't worry about it,
i'm too embarrassed to talk about it anyways
i just suck at life

"event","one of the j-term trips(january term, month long thing where you take a class, internship, or trip) was a two week trip to Louisiana to help with the hurricane relief through Habitat for Humanity.  the students that went gave a presentation last wednesday.  it was really good, first they each took turns reading one or two entries from journals they keep while on the trip.  it was really interesting to hear their descriptions of what they saw, and the things they did.  then they had a slideshow of pictures from the trip.  it made me wish i had gone on the trip, but honestly i don't know if i would of been able to handle it.  someone mentioned going down for spring break, which i got excited about, but apparently they have more college student volunteers then they know what to do with.  i want to do something, but i'm not sure what yet.  i'll figure something  out.

they also told stories about people's reaction when 12 women showed up to gut out their house.  home owner's asked ""why didn't you bring any guys?""  but after they finished moving out ruined furniture, cleaning mold covered walls, and pulling up carpet the owner's attitude changed. :)

something they said at the presentation was that a woman whose house they cleaned out told them to everyone here to ""not forget about us down here.""  if you think about it, you don't hear about hurricane relief anymore.  and from what the girls said, there's still an enormous amount of work to be done.  i don't know what area they were in, but they said it looked like the hurricane hit a few days ago."

"event","so i got back monday around 4, and i'm soooo glad to be back.  it wasa really weird being home for so long though, but then leaving so soon after i got used to being there.  goodbyes stink, but Judd, my brother, is going to come visit me this semester!!!! i'm so excited i can't wait, but he prolly won't be here anytime soon since i just saw him a week ago.....but still i can't wait.

i wish i could of gotten here earlier to have more time before school started but oh well.  classes started wednesday and my schedule is crazy this semester.  here's what i'm taking: Calc II, Lab in Math Experimentation, Cryptology, Evolution and the Human Condition, Elementary Spanish II, Painting, and the QR tutor class(they teach you to be a math tutor and then hopefully i'll be hired by the school next year to be a tutor).  So that's 7 classes for a total of 22 credits!! craziness, not to mention all the Batten Leadership stuff I have to do this semester, projects and papers and meetings....I'm excited though, I like being busy. although i am going to mark on my calender the last day to switch a class to pass/fail and the last day to drop, just in case ;)

so all the math classes are cool so far cuz they are with my calc teacher from last semester and she's so awesome.  i haven't had cryptology yet, should be interesting.  i think Evolution and the Human Condition is going to be my favorite academic class(obviously painting is going to be freaking amazing) cuz its with one of best biology teacers at the school and it's about evolution-which is like one of the coolest things ever! lol,  i have a different spanish teacher this semester which i was worried about but i think it'll be ok.  she's really nice and a good teacer.  i'm really excited about learning to paint, i've only done a little bit in high school and that was with acrylics, but also nervous since i haven't done art in a long time.  about half the class has taken the class before(studio art majors are allowed to repeat classes so that they can have a specific concentration) so that must mean they liked it.  i'm not sure about the QR tutor class, the teacher is kind of weird and pauses alot. but whats really cool is that none of my classes are bigger than 15 ppl!!! so fun.

what else....went to the VMI ""last chance"" mixer last night(it's their last chance to find a date for the winter formal), it was fun, danced with a couple guys but didn't really meet anyone.  lots of the guys were just standing around while the girls danced, lol, supposed they were waiting for us to ask them to dance(?). hello e drove over there for you guys, but o well.  went to ihop with the girls afterwards which was cool.  tonight we're going to celebrate Ash's birthday(yay!) prolly go out for dinner.  k i should really get back to my homework now.  later"

"event","so my internship started out pretty bad.....and then it got worse.

The first week I was barely there all day and most of the time i was there i wasn't doing anything.  Lisa, the associate professor i'm interning for, doesn't have much for me to do.  she gave me some stuff to read but then that was it.  i was there for a while the first friday, but that's cuz i couldn't find Lisa to ask if i could leave, then it turned out she was in a meeting so i left her a note and went home.  i barely see her, she is sooo busy all the time, and it makes it hard when i didn't know what to do.  i have gotten to see and learn some new things, but i'm not sure how much else i'm going to learn.  Lisa's ""project"" for me while i'm here is sectioning mouse brains and mounting a specific region on slides.  at first i was like cool! and i got to learn how to use a cryostat which keeps the brain cold (at -20 degrees celcius) and cuts really thin sections.  but now i've realized that's all i'm going to be doing for the rest of the time i'm here because she has me sectioning all 21 brains from her latest experiment.  after finally finishing practice, which i did for like 5 days -so boring- i started on the experiment brains yesterday(friday).  it took me the whole afternoon to finish one brain! and i stayed till 6:45pm.  so for the rest of the two weeks i'm here i'm pretty sure that's all i'll be doing, but i guess it's good experience....

just got home from hanging out with Laura.  we talked for a really really long time, it was nice.  don't see the movie hoodwinked btw.  she leaves tuesday :( but of course i can visit her at school so that'll be nice.  these last two weeks will be interesting, just me and my family.  at least i can go to my brother's place when i need to escape.

being home has been nice though.  when my family hangs out all together it is fun, we tease each other a lot.

k well i thought i had more stuff to say but i can't remember it, so later!"

"event","Last night was random but fun.  Laura, Tim, and I went to Beni's Pizza & Pasta and got a pizza with half pepperoni and half chicken(so good!), Joanna was supposed to come but she couldn't cuz she had to babysit :(  After that we went to my house to wait for Carl.  Once he got there and we finally decided to go bowling.  Tim drove us to Main Event, but they were having a private party. So we went to Fun Fest, but they were having a members only party and you could become a member for $35!  So we were like screw bowling, and instead drove through a car wash at Exxon cuz Tim didn't think his car was clean enough after the other car wash he went to that day.  And after that we went to the park near my house and played on that which was way fun.  Plus there were no clouds so the sky was pretty.  Then Gavin finally called me at 10:30, but he was going to this restaurant thing that we didn't want to go to so we went back to my house around 11:10 or so.  After Carl looked at the universal remote for like 20 min we tried to find a program on TV that was counting down with the central time zone(the best time zone!!), but then realized the tv screen was kind of messed up.  So Carl, Tim, and I took turns trying to fix it, gave up, and just watched ABC.  But they had already done the countdown(to easteren time, boo..) and apparently were not going to repeat it. so at 12:02 we wished each other Happy New Year, drank sparkling Apple Cider(thanks Carl), and opened those party cracker things(also, thanks Carl).  Then we watched Serenity (yay!!!) and half way through Gavin showed up(yay!!!!!!).  So then Laura, Tim, and Carl convinced Gavin to start playing World of Warcraft, not that it took much convincing, but it was still evil of them, grrr.  And then we tried to explain the movie best we could so Gavin wasn't completely lost.  After the movie we cleaned up and Tim, Carl, and Laura left.  Gavin and I went to IHOP which was fun, we talked a lot which was nice.  And I saw this guy I went to middle school with which was weird.  Then finally I came home and went to bed.  It was a good night, yay for friends and the new year and all that.

"event","so if i was still at the Limited i would be at work right now, dealing with all the last-minute shoppers and closing the store-meaning I'd be there till about 8 or 9.  but i'm not there cuz i quit! woot!  instead i'm working at Bob Bobbitt Custom Homes just helping them with stuff around the office.  Bob Bobbitt is a good family friend of ours and i worked there in highschool.  it's a lot better because i have a set hours during the day, and i don't have to work everyday or anything. so yay

anyways, it's crazy warm here in tejas, it was 62 today, but yesterday it was 71!!!  it's nice weather and all, but not when it's december.  i've got all my shopping done and everything wrapped.  mom and i had fun today doing last minute shopping.  we talked a whole bunch which was nice, plus there was this cute guy working at the place we went for lunch ;) just might have to go back sometime...

i haven't seen Brittany since tuesday, which really sucks since she's leaving for INDIA on monday. :(  and now she has the flu so i prolly won't get to see her till monday afternoon.  i think i got her a good gift as long as no one else got it for her.  and i didn't see Gavin the two days he was home, but at least he'll be back on the 30th.  got to go shopping wih Kristen which of course was fun and i got to have lunch with my covenent group(Laura, Joanna, and Jeanne) on wed.

just got finished having dinner at my grandma's (meaning we had dinner upstairs) which was really fun.  we all got dressed up and grandma pulled out her best china and all that, you could tell she was really excited.  we did fondue(which we do every Christmas eve), just for the meat-no chocolate fondue unfortunately, and it was yummy. i was looking forward to seeing a movie with Judd and Ru tonight but Judd's tired and has a headache so no movie. :( i'm gonna see if anyone is not busy with their family, like most normal people are at this time, and see if they want to do something.

Hope everyone is having a nice break!  Merry Christmas!!!"

"event","so i definately didn't get to see my friends and family as much as i would of liked this week(i'm never working over thanksgiving break again) but because it's thanksgiving and i feel like i don't appreciate what i have often enough, i thought i should remind myself of ALL the things i am thankful for.

so the obvious: my family and friends, home, freedom, america, the world, etc.

more specifically: i'm thankful for....
grocery shopping with my awesome grandma(she makes it so much fun)
watching random tv shows with my brother
being able to hang out with someone who can be entertained just by going to an aquarium/fish store (yay for fishies!), brookstone, sitting at starbucks, or attempting to make a gingerbread house.
being able to sit around with old friends and talk as if we'd never gone to college, and for having to always be the one to interupt when the conversation gets political... 
friends who turn conversations to politics.
friends who still haven't changed.
i'm so thankful for gypsy cuz she rocks my world
o Christmas music too.  
family friends who will buy mary kay products from me just because they've known me forever(and because my parents have bought stuff from their kids)

also thankful for Laura cuz she led me to Hollins which led me to my cool friends there.
and for Joanna cuz she gave me apple pie today ;) and she's super cool too.

thankful for all of my friend's boyfriends/girlfriends cuz they make my friends happy.
Brittany, just cuz she's cool but also for making my thanksgiving day with her dessert tradition
friends that like the word ""bitches"" and will boogie board with me.

my awesome roommate. just cuz she's freaking awesome.
loft beds.
and pancho, and sunny(hope he's still alive...)

friends that will play in the ocean with you and let you borrow their clothes for halloween
friends that introduce you to Rocky Horror and can practically knit anything
friends that convince you to sell MK and don't complain when you get them off track while studying
for new friends too.

"event","so starting yesterday i started working at the limited again.
work was weird cuz i hadn't been in a Limited store since this summer.  and the sales lead working at the time was from a different store so she didn't really know what was going on.  and the other girl working there at the time is named Summer!  she's really cool, but then most Summers are ;)  She's from New Orleans, she moved here after the hurricane.  She's in college and would be a sophomore, but since she went to school in New Orleans she can't get a transcript and can't prove that she's taken any classes, so she has to start over.  i don't know what i would do if that happened to me.  guess i'd figure it out somehow, but it really makes you realize how lucky you are.  there i was mad that i had to come into work, but here this girl had to completely start over in a brand new place and she's not complaining.  she said she believes God put her in this situation for a reason.  i don't believe in stuff like that, but props to her for having the strength to look at it that way.  she told me last time she closed the store by the time she left the buses had stopped running so she had to walk home through a very sketchy part of Dallas!  that night when we left the store i had forgotten she told me that, but luckily I decided to take a certian way home because i drove by her walking home.  so i turned around and picked her up and gave her a ride.  it was on the way so it wasn't a big deal, but that's something i can say was probably God, making me decide to take that way home even though it's not as quick as another way.

anyways, had to go into work again today, and close again today, but o well.  so News Flash! appartenly i'm racist.  a customer was nice enough to point this out to me while i was ringing her up and asked to see her ID when she paid with her credit card.  now since it's store policy that we check ID's with EVERY credit/debit card purchase, i'm so GLAD that someone pointed out to me that this wasn't fair.  i poke fun now, but at the time i was really upset.  i actually don't remember the entire event very well because i was so shocked.  but she handed me her card and i asked to see her ID and she started asking all these questions and saying things like ""oh you have to check ID for people of certians walks of life, certain flavors of people.""  and i told her we had to check all ID's.  she asked if we were like the express(at this time i was confused, i still couldn't believe that she was actually implying i was only checking her ID because she was black) and i said yes we are like the express, i think they have to check IDs there too. and she said something like ""yeah for certian colors, certain flavors of people"" and i just said what? and she asked if Macy's was a bigger store then the limited. by then my mind was like ?????????!?!?!?!?  and i said yes macy's is bigger than us, she said ""well i just spent 40 dollars there and they didn't ask for my ID"" and i stuttered ""different stores have different store policies, they must not require that IDs be checked, but we have too.""  i guess she didn't believe me and didn't see the confused, hurt, upset, innocent look on my face either cuz she just kept on that way.  of course i forgot to ask her to sign her stupid repceit so i had to run after her to get her to sign it, which she made some other remark but by this time my mind was so boggled i didn't even register what she said.  then of course i can't stop myself from getting upset.  i know i shouldn't of cared what she said, she was just some random angry woman that i'll prolly never see again in my life, but even though i told myself this i couldn't stop the tears welling up in my eyes.  so i had to check out the next customer who saw everything that happened and was soo nice about it.  she tried to make me feel better by askig if i was working the day after thanksgiving(which i am, please pray for me) but i couldn't help it i ended up mumbling over the walkie something to Andrea about finishing the transaction for me and i went to the back and broke down in the bathroom.(which btw Mary Kay mascara is cry-proof in case you wanted to know).  i got a hold of myself, but that didn't make my red, watery eyes disappear, but i had to go back to work.  so i come out to find that andrea either didn't hear me or completely ignored what i asked cuz the customer(who was the most awesome customer ever) was still there.  so i finished that and went about my business, but it was a looooong while before i could even think about what had happened without my eyes getting watery.  i'm over it now, but i WISH i could control my emotions better, i mean how stupid to get so upset, when i KNOW i'm not racist. i shouldn't let other people hurt me so easily, but oh well.

to try and finish on a positive note, we left at like 10:40 tonigh, yay and i work tomorrow but we close at 6 which means i'll be done at 8!! w00t w00t!!!  and Gavin showed me the most awesome website www.pandora.com - you type in a song or band you like and it creates a custom, commercial free, music station that plays songs similar to the one that you typed in!  try it! it's freaking awesome!  hope everyone is having a good break!!"

"event","so i'm a Mary Kay consultant, it's official, and getting started is becoming a pain in the butt.  but once i get going it will be good.  my Grand Opening at Hollins will be this Sunday(please come 7-9:30 in Janney Lounge) and my Grand Opening in Dallas will be next Sunday (Nov. 20th - contact me for details if you are interested!).  Basically a Grand Opening is a chance for me to let everyone know i'm a Mary Kay consultant, let's people try out some products(btw it's not all make-up), and give people a chance to schedule to host a party where they can earn free MK stuff.

i started this because i have several things i need to save money for: fixing dent on my car from stupid anonymos person that hit me in parking lot, spring break trip to Outer Banks, trip to New York sometime next year, trip to possible Europe after graduation, and of course GRAD school.  so if i work hard at this i can save up a lot of money.  plus i could get a new car or the money it would cost to get the car!  Christie told me a cool statistic that i can't exactly remember, but there are so many millionares in the US and a great majority of them are men. of the small percentage of women millionares 70% of the work for Mary Kay!!!  amazing!  now i don't plan on becoming an millionare, this is strictly part-time, but it's cool to know.

"event","i woke up around 1:00 because i was hot, so i got out of my loft bed and sat in front of the window where it was cool.  somehow i woke up jes who offered to let me use my fan that was in her bed.  so i tried to set that up but then it fell twice, finally got it up there and realized it was still hot.  so then i got the big fan(by this time brandon is awake too) and put it on top of the book shelf.  so now all the fans are up and going but i'm wide awake. i tried to go to sleep but now i'm here.

i don't like being awake like this, because all i think about are things like am i taking the right classes, doing the right major, am i even at the right school?  i just question everything and i basically cause my self to have a small anxiety attack, which is why i decided to get on the computer instead.  although i was hoping someone would be online to talk to, but no one is of course because they're normal ppl and are sleeping.  i'd like to talk to jes just to get my mind off things but she's asleep too.  and i wish i could do things like organize some things or study, but then i'd have to turn on lights and make noise which would wake jes and brandon up. yay, one of my friends from middle school, katie, is online so i'm talking to her.

i wish i could stay home for j-term.  i miss home so much sometimes(brandon is making weird short breathing noises, don't know what to call them, o he stopped now).  i don't think i'll get the internships i applied for cuz they don't seem keen on the one month thing, but maybe i can make up some independent study thing so i can stay home. but what?  any suggestions?

katie and i are talking about how it's weird to realize we are growing up.  i told her you just have to go on with life and not think about it, and she said yeah ""fast paced, head down.""  why can't i take the advice i give?  lol maybe this will be my motto from now on(now he's doing it again, is he awake and trying to get my attention or something? now he stopped again).

i'm feeling better now that i'm writing this down and talking to katie.  although i'm not so sure anymore that i want to go to the outerbanks instead of home for spring break.  i wish i could go on a trip with my friends AND go home. damn.  it why is Virginia so far from Texas??

Virginia is freaking awesome btw.  especially the Roanoke/New River Valley area where Hollins is.  it's soooooooooooo beautiful here, and the people are so cool.  the week before last Channel 10 raised $195,000 dollars through donations to build 4 houses to send to the gulf coast area(yay for Habitat for Humanity)  i mean Roanoke is a good size but it's not HUGE and that's AWESOME!

I'm glad Katie was online she's funny.  her thoughts on brandon's sleeping noises ""slap him, run to your bed before he's fully functional, and pretend it was an animal that jumped on his face""  but he's not making noise now.  i think i'm gonna look at some schedule stuff and maybe try to update my myspace.  later"

got this from Abbie, saw Rocky Horror at VT on friday and i'm still not sure what to think of it.  it was funny but soo crazy- tons of people with barely any clothes on, strange games, throwing of random objects at certain scenes, shadow cast, and people yelling things that made the movie funnier.

fall formal was Sat. and that was AWESOME, i really should find ways to dance more often- such good exercise!

o and I'm like an official Mary-Kay Consultant now, had my orientation on Sun. and got my starter kit today!  O and I got my loft yesterday, can't wait to put it up!!

Went to the Operation Home Delivery Build today(Habitat for Humanity all over the US is building houses to send to the Gulf coast area, Roanoke was the first to start the project after it was on the Today show, last week we did a telethon and raised enough to build another house(4 total)!) it was so awesome, we build the frames for 4 sheds today!

TWICE IF YOU CAN, cuz if this movie does well they might make a trilogy!! *crosses fingers* after the movie we visited the best Putt-Putt employee ever, Hillary! And we played some DDR! Later Jes and I went to Abbie's room and played Harry Potter Scene It! Abbie totally kicked our butts! but it was fun. </P>
<P>saturday i had job training to work at the Blue Ridge Autism Center, that was really cool, and i can't wait to get started. but i'm really nervous too. we'll see how it goes. after that i took my car to NTB to get the alignment fixed and to get two new tires, which they did a good job but they took too long. Jes picked me up so that i could shower and stuff while they worked on my car. she's so awesome! AND she picked up the dry cleaning for me while i was at job training!! like i said she's so awesome. Anwaywas after that Ash and I went to VMI(i know, vmi again?!) to see Dave and his friend Pete. Yeah i think seeing Ash and me was Dave and Pete's excuse to get someone with a car(since neither of them had one) to drive them around so that they could get beer. i could of parked at VMI and we could of just walked to downtown lexington(saving me gas), but not only did they want beer, Pete's the only one over 21, but they also wanted to go in their regular clothes instead of uniform(against the rules), so they couldn't be seen on campus, or in lexington, like that. it was just a stupid night. o yeah and we stood outside behind a random W &amp; L frat house for TWO hours so that Dave, Ash, and Pete could drink beer. woot woot. Pete's an ok guy when he's drunk, but when he's sober....ugh. but whatever, it was an experience, i guess. </P>
<P>today i had work which was easy, the only kid in the nursery was Adam and he's the most awesome two-year old boy ever! this afternoon i mummified a chicken for ancient art! it was awesome, there are some pictures on my webshots. and now i'm just dreading walking out to siberia to get my stupied cellphone out of my car(forgetful me!).</P>"

"event","so yesterday me, Jes, Abbie, and Ashely went to the VMI football game.  It was fun, we got to sit in the cadet section since Jes was with her(as of yesterday) boyfriend(hehe), Brandon.  And then Ashley saw her friend Dave and he sat with her.  So basically me and Abbie hung out and watched the game.  It was pretty good too, even though we lost 26-28 to Lehigh University.  Afterwards we went to the dining hall and just hung out, which was really fun cuz Brandon couldn't stop laughing and he gets bright red and wrinklely when he laughs hard.  And Dave is cool too, he and Ashley were cute together.

After that we meet up with Jes's friend Matt and went downtown to get dinner.  On the way to Macado's we got stopped by this weird guy, who as he walked up to us kept saying ""non-threatening african-american approaching"", which was weird enough to begin with.  So then he gave us this whole long story, that included things that didn't fit with the story at all, and basically asked us for gas money because he ran out of gas.  Abbie, Ashely, and I gave him some money in hopes that he'd leave us alone.  But then he still didn't leave, he kept talking and told us that we looked fabulous and that he's a bachelor, and he can't wait to watch some football!  Finally he left and we got some yummy sandwiches at Macado's.  Afterwards we walked through market street just so Matt and Abbie could see.

THEN we went to Putt-Putt to visit Hillary, and play putt-putt.  That was way fun too, and I just remembered that Abbie was keeping score, but I don't think she said who won.  Although we all kept cheating a lot, so I don't know how the scoring worked out.  After that we finally came back to Hollins.

All in all it was a awesome day."

"event","and i have nooo clue when i'm going to do everything i need to do, but oh well.

mom and I went to IKEA today (or yesterday, technically) and together we bought a small blanket, a set of four bowls, four plates, four cups, and four sets of reusable plastic wear(all of it is microwave and dishwasher safe, yes!), a small scale, a cd case, a fun ice tray, a small and medium sized cutting board, and a mixing bowl that came with a lid - all for 32 bucks! amazing!  anyways IKEA is cool and i might order more stuff from them after jes and i have got our room set up and i can figure out what i want/need.

what else...hung out with Laura, Tim, Carl, and Carl's friend John tonight.  I had told Tim and Laura that if they would rather play World of Warcraft that was fine with me, but Tim said no he wanted to go out.  So while I dropped stuff off at my house he got a hold of Carl and made plans to, get this, go to Lan-Shark where we'd all get on computers and play computer games with each other. what fun.... i wanted to hang out with them and seeing as i was the only non-gamer in the group i decided not to bother to protest. so we go and this place is like the lamest thing i've ever seen. for one they totally need to be playing music in there so you are not completely forced to listen to the weird things other ppl are saying. but anyways it's this small room with some tables and like 6 computers at each table. so you sign in and pay 3 bucks and hour to play computer games on their computers.  so someone decided we'd play Counter-Strike Source so we start that up.  Thank God for Tim because at this point he's the only one taking the time to explain anything to me, Laura was playing another game and John and Carl were trying to decide things about the game i think.  Anyways it's this first-person shooting game and for some reason every time we all played on the same team against the computer or ""bots"".  and the points of the game are to set a bomb to blow up the other team, keep the other team from setting their bomb, defusing their bomb if they set it, and most importantly killing ever member of the other team. and that's it, you just do this over and over again, in the same level mind you, till the comp decides you've done this enough times to move on to the next place. I mean where is the fun in doing the same thing over and over again?!? it was sooo boring, but i didn't say anything cuz they were having fun and we all drove together so i couldn't leave or something, but it was an experience i guess. damn boys turing my friend into a gamer...o well, lol

anyways i'm tired so i should prolly get to bed even though i've been avoiding sleep lately.  i don't know why i just find myself making the excuse ""if i do this it'll help me sleep"" more often each night. but it's 3 in the morning and i've got packing to do so to sleep i go!  see you all really soon!!"

So the good news! The sales lead Aurora, that I hate working with, is stepping down and has turned in her two weeks notice! Yay!  The bad news - I have two weeks left of working.  Haha, well at least she won't be here when I am home for the holidays.  I haven't gotten a chance to talk to the store manager about transfering my job to Roanoke, but hopefully it'll work out.

I'm on-call today from six to close, but if they actually call me in I might have to shoot myself.  I've closed the store the last five nights in a row!!  I kind of got myself into the situation but on accident really! lol, I told this girl on sunday I'd cover her monday shift, and then on monday another girl reminded me that I told her a week ago that I'd cover her tuesday shift.  Now yes this is good cuz I'm getting paid and all but omg I'm so tired.  I have a really hard time falling asleep right after I've gotten off work, I don't know why I just do.

And this weekend is tax-free weekend so the store will be crazy busy(for you non-Texans we have a weekend once a year around the start of school when clothing and shoes are tax-free, but only pieces that are under 99 dollars count).  I don't know if they do this in any of the other states, but anyways I'm not looking forward to working this weekend.  But maybe we'll at least make enough money to cover our payroll!(yes our store sucks so bad that sometimes we don't even make payroll!!)"

"event","so i know i'm prolly making a big deal out of nothing, but that's what i do plus it's that time of the month where all my feelings are completely whack.  anyways i really screwed up today with a good friend of mine and i've apologized but i still feel really bad, cuz she's still mad at me.  plus there's another thing that happened today but i don't want to talk about that now.  and i know what's really killing me is that i can't fix either things! there's just nothing more I can do except wait for my one friend to stop being mad at me and the other thing just can't be fixed.  and i just keeping thinking about things with this summer that i wish could have been different. it's kind of a never ending cycle one depressing thing just leads me to think of other depressing things and it goes on from there.  and then i worry about this year and whether everything is going to be ok. and then i think of how soon i'll be leaving and i realize that i'm not ready to leave my friends here, even though i can't wait to see my friends at school. ah! it just doesn't make sense and i can't do anything about it but lie in my bed and cry myself to sleep. and then it comes back to am i really this sad or is it just damn horomones messing with my head? i never know.  oh well knowing me i'll be over it and happy in a few days, which leads me to ask if what i'm feeling is real and i just get over things quickly, or are all these things in my head?"

"event","right now i am sweaty, sandy, and close to vomiting and i couldn't be happier.  ;)
today was soooo awesome.

ok so nothing exciting happened this morning but after lunch Laura and I took this baby bird to the outdoor learning center.  my mom found it next to our drive way right underneath our bird house.  it couldn't fly and it was limping really bad, so we called the vet and she told us where to take it.  there were remains of an adult bird near the baby bird, obviously something had gotten it, so since the baby bird was still there he/she was obviously a bad ass.  so Laura and i named him/her Fuzzy Badass.  anywho we put the bird in a box and took it out to this center and that was fun.

then Laura had to go home and do laundry so i went out with Kristen to do some errands and that was tons of fun too. we found some hilarious cards at the card shop in the Galleria.  Then we meet up with Han for dinner at Chili's.  That was awesome too cuz Han's a cool guy.  Then we all meet up with Carl at the movies and saw Bewitched which wasn't very good as far as quality goes but it was still fun and cute, definately worth it if you liked the show.  Then after that we went to Java & Co. where Carl is apparently a regular.  Then we stayed there for like 2 hours just chillin and playing card games.  Then Han left cuz he had a headache and was no fun.  So Kristen took me and Carl to see her favorite place in Plano and then we drove around a bit listening to awesome music.  Then when we finally thought of something else to do we went to the park by my house to go on the swings.

Then while swinging i remembered that my park has an awesome merry-go-round and we played on that for the rest of the night basically which explains the sweaty, sandy, about to toss my cookies part. omg i've never had so much fun, it was awesome.  i've been to the park with friends before but i never really played like that.  tonight i just didn't care if i got really sweaty or dirty, all i cared about was trying to make the merry-go-round go as fast as i could.  it was so stress free and just pure fun.  so now i'm gonna go to bed and fall into a deep deep sleep.  and if you are ever feeling stressed out i highly suggest going to the park and playing till you are physically sick."

Hopefully it'll work out and I'll find some girls that I like, we'll see.  O, and a woman came in the store with her son and first off her son, who was like two, spilled a huge drink on some pants and then she didn't pay for them(we can't make ppl pay apparently) and then she changed the kids diaper in the store!!! gross.

Today I was at my intership and if my work continues to be what it has been then I'm just going to call it volunteer work instead of an internship cuz that's what it is.  What I did today: addressed 113 postcards and 14 evelopes by hand(handcramp!), updated two files by changing the dates, searched for two addresses online but couldn't find them, made some corrections on the resource list, oh yeah ran all that mail through the meter thing, and ate lunch at Chili's.  How much of this stuff has to do with marketing(my title is marketing intern): none of it.  How much of this stuff has to do with regular office work that doesn't count for college credit: all of it!  But whatever, Carroll is really cool and I think I could learn from her, plus I'll make good contacts by interning there.

"event","Has anyone ever played the game called ""I've never"" before?  I hadn't until last night.  apparently it makes a good drinking game, although we didn't play with alcohol.  Very interesting game, you find out a lot about people, some of which you don't want to know..., but anyways- If you haven't played it before what you do is you sit in a circle of chairs, and you have just enough chairs for everyone except one person, that person stands in the middle and they have to think of something they've never done, had, seen, etc., just something they've never- when they say what they've never done everyone sitting down that HAS done that has to get up and find another seat, you can't go to the seat next to you unless you have to and the person left without a seat is the new person in the middle(the middle person steals someone's seat too).  Like to get it started last night the guy who went first said that he'd never had PMS, so of course all the girls scrambled for a new seat.  - this game can get very interesting if you think about it, and it did because a couple of guys there had done A LOT"

"event","so had my first day of interning at the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR) Texas Office.  it was interesting.  i really didn't do much work except find address some envelopes and find directions to a place for lunch, but most of the morning i spent learning more about NAAR and the walk they do(btw everyone should go! Sept. 24 Grande Prairie, TX~ it supports Autism research, and Autism is the NUMBER ONE mental disablity, 1 million Americans have some form of Autism and it is estimated that 1 child in 250 births will be autistic!!!!) so anyways the real highlight of the day was my 2 and half hour lunch with Carroll, Marketing Director for NAAR Texas (person i work for), and A'lisha, the Director of Community Affairs for CBS/UPN!!!!!  That was cool just to hear all the stories and how Carroll explained the marketing problems withen NAAR and blah blah blah, but it was cool, but also way too long.

I got off at like 3 so I did some job hunting and I have an interview with Gap tomorrow and I have applications from PacSun, Express, and Victoria's Secret to turn in.  I would LOVE to work at Victoria's Secret, that would be awesome, but the other stores are cool too, so we'll see."

"event","President Bush's Inaugration is coming up and the plans of protesting are already in action.  I for one do not see the point of protesting the actual reinstatement of Bush and think the protests are disrespectful to our President.  But that's my opinion, you can think what you want.

Protestors argue that they have complaints about Bush and his administration that they would like to voice.  But why not do that at a more appropriate time?  Maybe protest at an event that has something to do with your complaint, or start a petition and keep continuous contact with your State congressmen/women and representatives.  Bush won the election, end of story.  It is much more important that the candidate the country wants in office is there, than the candidate a few political activists want in office is there.

Protestors also argue that a large amount of votes for Kerry were not counted or something.  Personally I think these protestors are just mad that their candidate didn't win.  And I'm not trying to bash democrats or anything, cuz I know for a fact that there would be just as many protest and complaints from Bush supporters had Kerry won.  The same accuzation that certain votes were not counted would have also been made by republicans had Kerry won.  But the point about the whole thing I'm trying to get to is this-
Privite orgainizations have done their own recounts to see if Bush really won or if Kerry was robbed of his victory.  Some orgainizations have annouced that Kerry should of won and some said that Bush did really win.  Which one is correct?  More importantly- Who's telling the truth?

Truth doesn't seem to exsist when it comes to politics, but then I'm come to realize it doesn't seem to exist anywhere.

You are upset because your friends left you out of something.  But you do not confront them because you are not sure if they intentionally left you out and you know you have accidently left them out of things before.  Even so, you still feel hurt.  But instead of talking to them and getting the truth out there you keep quiet, slowly growling farther apart.

You are new, or something has happened that makes you question yourself.  You create a new you, the one you think you'd like to be.  But then something else happens, causing you to change yourself again.  Then again you feel forced to make a reassessment of yourself.  And soon you lost the true you and don't know where to look.


You know in your heart that something needs to be done about a problem.  But telling the truth doesn't get it done, or doesn't get you where you need to be to fix it.  So you tell lies because it's for the greater good right?  And you tried to tell the truth, but no one was interested in that.  The truth is too boring, too plain and simple, or too scary.  Really, I mean who wants the truth?  When lies are so much more exciting and dramatic?  I would like to say the truth is dead and buried in everyone's backyard, but that would be too exciting, everyone would be back there digging it up.  The truth is like some kind of parasite we keep inside, and the longing we keep it in the more and more it eats us up.  And all we have to do is let it out.  But that would be too simple, too easy.

Sorry about this weird, and prolly bad atempt at a well-written rant.  I've just been think a lot lately."

"event","Just to let you know, if you ever need a job-Braum's will hire ANYone.

My brother and I went there tonight to get some ice cream(weird thing to do when it's 30 degrees outside, but whatever).  I pull up to the drive thru menu and there is a sign on the speaker that says ""pull up to window.""  So once we know what we want I pull up to the window.  A short woman comes to take my order and I tell her that I want one small vanilla Mix with Butterfinger and one small chocolate Mix with Butterfinger.  Not that hard right?  So she says ""you want one regular vanilla Mix with Butterfinger and one what?""  So I correct her, and then she still doesn't have the order right so I repeat it again and she seems to have it fine.

Judd and I sit there waiting for our ice cream and another woman comes to the window.  She tells us that something(I didn't understand her at first) wasn't working-I though maybe the mix machine was broken and I was sad cuz I thought-no ice cream.  But she was telling us that the speaker wasn't working and that they weren't able to hear anyone through it.  I told her that we knew it was broken and that that was why we pulled around.  Then she told me again about how the speaker was broken and I told that I knew and that there was a sign on it that said to pull around.  She says that she needs to change that sign because they can't hear anyone through the speaker(!!!).  And so I'm like okay, but we've already placed our orders.  She asks if we've paid yet, I say no and give her the money.

Then the woman that took the order comes over to the window with our ice cream but in the wrong size(larges instead of smalls).  The second woman tells her so and makes her change it.  After seeing the second woman walk past the window with our ice cream(in the right cups) but then walk away, she finally comes back and we get our ice cream.

Moral of the story- when you see a sign that says the speaker isn't working at a Braum's just go inside or just don't go to Braum's all together.

"event","I went present shopping with my brother today.  Our parents are SO hard to shop for.  Neither of us thought of any good ideas of what to get them.  My dad gets himself everything he wants and my mom...I just don't know what to get her.  

It was fun though becasue we went into all the funky stores like Sharper Image, Brookstone, Discovery Channel Store, etc. and played with the electronics and stuff.  I have some good ideas of what to get my brother now, but I only need to get him one gift and so I'll have to figure out which one to get him.

I've been in such a crappy mood the past two days and I don't know why.  Well, I kind of don't know why.  I think it's that my brother lives here, but doesn't live in the same house.  I know he's much happier living on his own, but I miss not being able to go to his room to see what's up, or having him knock on my door and popping his little shaved head in to tell me something weird he found out on the internet.  

O well, things change, guess I just got to get used to it.  But whatever, maybe I'll feel better tomorrow."

"event","I'm really just making this journal entry to help me pick a layout that I like.  I'm using this new journal to avoid my homework and yearbook.  Yay! good for me, doing what I always do-putting off things till the last minute.  But hey I have cramps and don't feel like doing anything.

Anyways, on a happier note, I was walking through the library and think that I should really come here more often.  It's such an awesome library with neat little nooks to read and study in, and good computers.  And the Hollins Room is such a pretty room and a neat place to study. K, I think that's enough for now, promise I'll something better when I actually have time!"

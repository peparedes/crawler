"event","Okay so the John Mayer/Maroon 5 concert...Words can't explain. After the concert I was speechless. I just couldn't think of the right words to describe this whole experience. I still can't. Everything positive I could possibly say is a horrible understatement. A complete and total understatement. I don't even know how I didn't die of a heart attack or something of the sort. For the first time in my life I was in complete utter bliss. Nothing in the world could bring me down. I was so god damn happy. Maroon 5 took the stage first and theyyyyy rocked it! They were awesome! They were so great. But when John took the stage I LOST it. It was kind of dark so you could see his tall lanky shadow and his curly hair and I just seriously LOST it. I'm surprised I even have a voice today. Im surprised I could even move my body when I woke up this morning. I was jumping and dancing around for like 3 1/2 hours. I was just so happy. I've have never experienced happiness like that. I'm just so lucky to have seen the one musician i absolutely love live. I'm so fucking lucky. I had so much fun. My brother and I had such a blast at that concert, it was such a great show. I thought I had the time of my life at the Dashboard Confessional concert..but this show was like a million times better. And I admit, I did have a fucking goooood time at the Dashboard concert. God damn...I'm seriously blessed. 

So anyways today I woke up came over to Lindsey's. Then Anna and Nicole came then Shawn, Gary, and Dave came over. We all then ventured to the mall in two different cars and lost each other somehow. So we waited a good hour for Gary and Dave in the parking lot...then I started getting wicked pissed. We all were wicked pissed. Then we all met up again came home, dropped Anna and Nicole off then we went to the 99. Then we came back here to Lindsey's. (Mind you I am at Lindseys right now posting this) Today was an emotional up and down. Last night on they way home from the concert I was listening to a song called ""Back to you"" by John Mayer and I just thought of someone. And it sucks.  
</lj-cut>
Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late

I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit ever game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away

Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too

Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be
-These lyrics are absolutly perfect. I can't even explain. They're just so perfect. </3 End of story.
</lj-cut>

I don't know why but I just feel so god damn heart broken. I don't mean to just blabber on like ""omg im so hurt feel bad for me"" because thats not it at all. It just sucks when I realize who I have cared about in the past and I either fucked things up, or just lost them. I've fucked things up with a lot of people, and to you I'm sorry. I truly am sorry. And to a couple of those people I still care about you to this day. And it just sucks. Especially today, it's a rainy sucky weather kind of day...so hearing these lovey songs makes my mind wonder...and to myself I think what if? What if i never did that...what if we were still together today? But I know its worthless now because things like this won't even change. The weather usually reflects my mood. I discussed this with Nicky the other day and he agreed with me, it affects him too. The weather plays a big part on my mood. I don't know why it does, but it does and I hate it.
""I can see your face but I know it's not real, just an illusion caused by how I used to feel""

I wish Nicky was around tonight. But he's working. He knows how to comfort me when I'm down. Either that or I wish Ian was around to talk to..or better yet, I wish both of them were here, they always know how to make me smile. And for that I love you guys. You are MAH BOIIIZ (in ebonics)<3
This is pathetic. This is the first day in a lil bit that I haven't seen Nicky. And I already miss him..I'm so god damn pathetic sometimes. But I guess that's a good thing, atleast you know how much I love you Nicky <3.

-Not so happily yours
Mee Jin"

"event","I reckon tonight about an 8 or a 9..maybe a 91/2 in four beers time--

Wow. W-O-W Seems to describe today. 

After my Dr's appointment I went to Alicia's and played in the rain with Ms. Lindsey. I came home after play time and took a shower got semi ready and then Nicky picked me up. We then went to his house spent some quality time together and then decided it was time to VOGUE! We headed to Mikes and that's where my night begun....

After learning for the millionth time my dancing/ hand eye coordination skills abosultely dreadfully suck...We went to go see if the cake Mike and his friend Alyssa decided to make prior to our arrival, was ready.. Mike and Alyssa thought that it would be an awesome idea if they made glaze out of granulated sugar....But we later learned that granulated sugar did not get the job done. It actually looked like ejaculant. Of course we didn't want this ejaculant sugar like substance to go to waste so then I came up with the brilliant idea that we should carve a penis out of a potatoe. Nicky being the sculptor that he is then carved an amazing looking penis out of one single Idaho potatoe. We decided it would be funnier if we died it black with food coloring. So dye it black we did! We then dribbled the ejaculant substance onto the top of this black penis and BAADDDDAAAHHHH there you have it...the greatest looking faux penis you have ever seen in your life! Of course we took pictures of me licking it...so that should soon be my lj icon. But it gets even BETTER! (I know what you're thinking...how could this night get even better, but my answer for you would be: Oh it can indeed.) After leaving Mike's house Nicky and I attempted to turn the corner where the Teal Chevy Trailblazer gave out and semi stalled....There we are stuck at the corner of Janet Rd with no where to go. (Cathy or UNCBEN would've been so clutch in this situation) So we called good ol trust AAA, we called at approximately 8:56...the Mr. Tow Truck Man (who i later learned was Mr. Scott) finally arrived at 9:52. Yes we did wait over an hour...and yes we also got many bug bites to prove it. (Including all over my glutious maximous) Mr. Scott then gave me a ciggarrette so the world was a better place. Once I get nicotine flowing through my veins...I am invincable. Anyways it was so exciting because I got to ride in a tow truck for my very first time. Basically I was a tow truck virgin until tonights occurance. Anyways me being me, decided it would be a wonderful idea to tell Mr. Scott about the wonderful happenings of tonight. He seemed quite amused. We rocked out to some good ol Juvenile ""Slow Motion"" and LiL Scrappy ""Let me In"" (Dj G-Spin was cluth in this given situation...more clutch than Cathy or even UNCBEN) In fact I think Mr. Scott fell absolutely head over heels in love with me at his first glance. Nothing but a short little Asian girl with her f'ing bangs in her eyes...a white t-shirt red shorts and black chucks was the outfit of choice. I was the one he let go...Anyways moving on he towed us to the nearest gas station and then departed. And what a sad departure it was....But then Nicky and I blasted Joey and the Pussycats all the way to the quaint little Schenk abode. 

schenkneSs: Mr. Scott was the emptimy of a LUCAS..perhaps even a bob
PheonixFireBurns: yes.. perhaps a bob.. hmm ::ponders::
schenkneSs: ::looks puzzled:: I think he may have well been a bob
..and with that folks we darn well have it. Mr Scott was a definite BOB

BIG FYI! I just got information that Nicky showed his parents the Mee Jin inspired penis...they loved it! I can die happy now :)I made Mr. Nick (Nickys dad) laugh..that is blatantly AWESOME! 

So anyways after this whole tow truck escapade ended and I came home..I walked to ALicia's for a little bit. In my company was Alicia, Mike, Lindsey, and Joey..and later on Tawny. But anyways it was good to see Joey because I haven't seen him in for what feels like ages...I'm sorry I was being such a bitch Joey, I get moody..sorry. 

I've been thinking a lot...about me and boys...and I'm just so confused...I hate not knowing anything for sure. I hate how I always pass up a sure thing, and regret it after....but in the end, I still love how you can tell all the pieces of me <3

Besdies that I had a Dr's appointment so I had to wake up at the ass crack of dawn (aka 10:30)...That went well. I somehow lost 5 pounds..thank god! So that news cheered me up. Today I am going to be with Nicky (as usual) and I think we might go to Mike's house to do some Vogue-ing of some kind. :)

Alright kids, I will be back to write later.

I will now end this journal entry with some words by Bright Eyes...

What fun we have when we're out with not so good intentions.

Okay so today i was so rudely awoken at around 12:30 ish by my dad, but I didn't end up rolling my lazy ass out of bed till 1ish. I stopped by Alicias (Lindsey, Tawny and Mike were there) then came home showered ultra fast and was picked up by Nicky. We then went to go pick up Ian...Where we then saw UNCBEN!!!!!!!!! (hahahahahaha) SO after we picked Ian up we went to the BUrlington Mall and picked up Nickys paycheck...Of course we went in the COACH store...(orrrrgassssmic) And then I went into Sephora drenched myself in D&G perfume (Sicily...nothing but the best) and then it was all ruined because Jessica Simpson's ""Desert"" line products smell like cakeeeeee!! So I smelled like DOLCE CAKE! God damn Jessica...I like your music and all, but your desert line kinda sucks. So after that we ate at Uno's and came back to mi casa. Called Nicole and Anna...(Anna you were sleeping babe) Nicole came over we got some flashlights and headed to Tewksbury to check out some abandoned houses. Yeahhhh that was fun. While trying to avoid being seen I dove into what I thought was shrubbery...but it ended up being a HUGE rock...ergo Big bruise on Kayla's knee. Who ever knew that rocks could look like shurbbery in when not well lit. Eewww I also got some kind of sticky plant stuck in my hair. That was nasssty.So anyways our mission was left unfulfilled but we did have uber fun. We then went to Walmart....what fun Walmart can be on a Wednesday night! We had fun with five dollar ""try me"" electric razors and cheap winter fur ont he collar jackets......and of course we did have a camera present. Cathy was clutch in this situation. Cathy is a middle aged Walmart employee that has facial hair issues. She helped us find hair relaxer..what a sweet heart. Ian and I 007'd Cathy. (a.k.a followed her down random aisles and rolled about like we were secret agents.) We tried to play four square in an aisle with big bouncy balls but I suck at anything that even remotely refers to sports. It reminded me of this famous scene in clueless...

Amber: My surgeon told me to stay away from anything where balls fly at my nose
Di: There goes your social life...
(word for word i know that isn't right but you get the idea....)

Anyways from Walmart we proceeded to go to Newbury Comics where we met my girlfriend Alyson (hahaha inside joke) and had a wild and crazy dance party! (Club Nicky) ""SHIQUI LOVE;SHIQUI LOVE;SHIQUI LOVE;SHIQUI,SHIQUI,SHIQUI LOVE!"" -Thrasher I love you!- 

Hmmm. In general tonight was a goooooood night! The past few nights have been quite good, If I do say so myself. And of course while all this mischievous fun occurs Josey and the Pussycats is blasting in the backround....thats just a given. 

Nicky has introduced ""The Streets"" to me..which is some great British rap-ish group.
""Im not trying to pull you even tho I would like to I think you are really fit,your fit but my gosh dont you know it"" -Fit but you know it

Lately I've been having such a good time.

Operation speedo is a go! ((Mission accomplished))

So I havent written in this thing for a while. Monday was fun I went to outright then had an uber interesting car ride home with Mike and Lori. Sooo many inside jokes. ""omg guys we're gonna die..sorry!"" lol. That night Nicky met me at my house and he brought me some scrumptious peanut butter cookies...""I HAVE CHEESECAKE!"" 

So anyways yesterday Nicky came to pick me up we went to Vaughn's for a little bit..then back to his house, then we went to go pick up Ian. Lemme tell you...listening to Josey and the Pussycats while the wind is blowing through your hair is an experience like no other! Last night was so fun..me and Ian sticking our bodies half way out the Chevy trailblazer while motioning for all the tractor trailers to beep their horns was much fun! We went tot he lillipop graveyard last night (Nicky, Ian, Anna, Nicole and I) and walekd thru it..it was kinda creepy, then we drove up Cult Rd....creepy/fun.

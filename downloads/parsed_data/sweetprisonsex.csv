"event","easter was good, told the family of my intentions. 
they werent happy at first but what can they really say?  
im goin on 25 and have everything planned and ready and waiting
not their call
after a little bit they warmed up to the idea and were ""ok"" with it....sort of
theyll miss me n stuff but whatever they only see me a couple times a year so as it is,
theyll live, and they can always come visit



Just tell me what you've got to say to me,
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth,
It comes as no surprise at all you see,
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through.

Now I know your heart, I know your mind,
You don't even know you're being unkind,
So much for all your high brow Marxist ways,
Just use me up and then you walk away.
Boy, you can't play me that way.

Well I guess what you say is true,
I could never be the right kind of girl for you,
I could never be your woman.

When I saw my best friend yesterday,
She said she never liked you from the start,
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same,
But you always knew you held my heart.

You're such a charming, handsome man,
Now I think I finally understand,
Is it in your genes?, I don't know,
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure,
Why did you play me this way?

Well I guess what you say is true -
I could never be the right kind of girl for you!

Well I guess what they say is true,
I could never spend my life with a man like you
I could never be your woman."

hi! im alive and kickin quite well
tons has happened and nothings happened in the past year +
isnt it funny how that works?

ive loved - ive lost - ive laughed and cried
all of the usual goings on

couple of major things come to mind

my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer with a year to live
this was back around christmas
stage 4 metabolic lung cancer
hes on chemo every week, and it seems to be helping
hes always very tired and sore the next day but hes doing better with it
he dosnt get sick from it anymore and the tumors are 
showing signs of shrinkage which it THIS case is a very good thing
his spirits are up and he stays hopeful but isnt expecting much 
:/  ever the realist i suppose

my brother finally got shipped of to iraq on wed.
hes in the navy and has been in and out of training all over the country.
some sort of para-rescue thing, i dunno
hell be doing a 2 month tour with his company, 
come back for a  month or so and go again for another 6 months....
i was hoping we'd be pulling out from over there by now
but i guess thats not happening any time soon
hes had a death wish most of his life, hope he dosnt do anything too stupid

im still working as a product specialist at people first
dont like it much but at least im good at it
wont be doin it for much longer though

im finally moving to florida
its really truly official this time
puttin in my two weeks and keepin an eye on air fares
my mom n her husband are flyin up to help me drive the truck down
got money saved up, a home and job waiting for me down there, 
and nothin to hold me back here

im so excited

life is good and about to unfold in front of me
ill be leaving mid may
if theres any old chums still out there do look into gettin together
i am as ever up for adventures

ive been practicing parallel parking, im screwed tho...every 2 out of 3 times i try i fuck it up. 
i dont need a lot of room to get into the spot, but i have a hard time getting far enough into the space without hitting the curb, or getting into the space and being straight.  why does this shit have to be so damn complicated lol. i never need to parallel park - ever... wtf...  
i should be exempt from that part of it...just cuz i say so  XD

i got my permit renewed, and resceduled my driver test for the 31st....(i hope i hope i hope)

a friend of mine makes sculptures and moulds n stuff using all kinds of resins n metals. ive been helping him make them for a couple years now. he used to work for a company called smooth on, and is trying to get back with them. his friend in the company happens to be one of my customers at TH, and he might be able to get me a job there pouring moulds, and sample pallets for different resins...starting at 18/hr  0_o
thats 10 more than im making now.....(i hope i hope i hope)

my roomate got a new g/f, im happy for her. her g/f seems nice.....
too bad she turned into a total hypocrite (sp?) and everything that she bitched at me constantly, over the past 3 years, about me and brian for, she is now doing...spending every waking moment together, and having her here all the time and so on...
granted i dont hold any of that against her, i knew, once she found someone, thats how it would be. thats how its SUPPOSED to be, the point is shes made such a big stink about it for so long and now she turns around and does it herself....thats a little fucked up. but whatever...brian and i are gonna look for an apartment soon. if i get that smooth on job and he gets the job with a friend of his doing construction/remodeling, making about the same im hoping to make, we'll do just fine, and we can really start saving to move south.

i still dont know if it will be florida or georgia, but i still deffinetly wanna get the HELL outta here.

i left with just enough time to get there yesterday, got about halfway there and realized not only that brian forgot his lisence, but that it expired 4 days ago...but we went and got it anyway, and STILL got there at 9 on the dot (when i was supposed to be there).
so i went and parked and we went in to see what i needed to do. the guy inside said to park in the training bay n the instructor would be there in a minute.
ok....no problem....
went to move the car, while brian stood on the sidewalk to smoke a cigarette, not 10 ft away.
i moved my car 3 SPACES...and the instructor was like ""whos taking the test today?""
i said i was n he said ""not today....you were driving without a lisence, go home and rescheduel""
....WHAT??
i know theyre there to pick out every little thing i do wrong n everything but COME ON!!
its not like i drove there myself, i just moved over a few spaces to where i needed to be, and i did have someone *right there*... but he wasnt physically in the car with me, so i never even got to take the test. 
now i have to wait 6 weeks to take it again, and my permit expires in 2-3 weeks....goddamnit godamnit!!

even if brian had been in the car with me, i probably wouldnt have been sent home any way b/c of his lisence being expired...but still....what the shit"

florida was GREAT. 
i had an awseome time with my mom, even though i was at church EVERY day 
(shes a born again christian and she lives a block away from her church, where she also works as a custodian, so i went every day to help her clean so we got done faster)
we went thru the attic and pulled down all the boxes of old crap she kept over the years 
(shes even more of a pack-rat than I am, thats pretty bad) i remembered most of it.
we sculpted clay, i made an elephant n it was really good, but it was natural clay n we needed a kiln to fire it...which we obviously didnt have, n while it was air drying it got knocked over n the ear broke off :(  oh well
she took me all over showing me off to EVERYONE she knew n they were all ""So happy to see me, n they felt like they already knew me for how much she talked about me""   ...  great, the first sunday i was there i swear the entire congregation came up to me at some point and said those same words, n all of her friends and ""family"" (she adopted ppl as her family since her real, and real adoptive family sucked) said the same thing too...then it was ""so when are you moving down here to keep her this happy all the time?"" (i hope to move down there in about a year)
we went out on a boat in the bay which felt like bathwater when we swam in it. i got a little burned but that went away in a few days n youd never be able to tell i got ANY sun from looking at me now...i hate my complexion. 
i read the ENTIRE 'elf quest' series which i havent done in 10 years...i picked up on SO much more. man i love my elfs. XD
my mom started knitting me a scarf the second day i was down there and finished it about 20 minutes before i got on the plane to come back lol. its really cool but its pink, yellow and green (the most recent picture she had of me was my 7th grade photo...in it i wore a hideous sweater that i HATED with pink, yellow, n green stripes...she thought it would be cute)  it has pom-poms on both ends, which are stitched into pockets, so if i forget my gloves i can put my hands it them, or it can hold my cigs n cell phone....pretty handy.
we did some other stuff too...but im tired and i need to go to bed...i have a long day tomorrow. i have to open the store at 5, n then come home at 2 and get a check for $350,000  O_o 
oh yeah...thats right...im getting a hefty check tomorrow...HA in yo face bitches !!!
nitey nite :)"

Just like the hearse you die to get in again 
We are so far from you 

Burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate 
The lives of everyone you know 
And what's the worst to take 
from every heart you break 
And like the blade you stain 
Well I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst That I could say?
Things are better if I stay 
So long and goodnight 
So long and goodnight 

Came a time 
When every star fall brought you to tears again 
We are the very hurt you sold 
And what's the worst to take 
from every heart you break 
And like the blade you stain 
Well I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst That I could say? 
Things are better if I stay 
So long and goodnight 
So long and goodnight 
Well if you carry on this way 
Things are better if I stay 
So long and goodnight 
So long and goodnight 

Can you hear me? 
Are you near me? 
can we pretend 
To leave and
then we'll meet again when both our cars collide

What's the worst that I can say? 
Things are better if I stay 
So long and goodnight 
So long not goodnight 
Well if you carry on this way 
Things are better if I stay 
So long and goodnight 
So long and goodnight"

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Emo Kid</B></FONT><BR>You are 28% Rational, 14% Extroverted, 28% Brutal, and 28% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Emo Kid, best described as a quiet pussy! You tend to be an intuitive rather than a logical thinker, meaning you rely more on your feelings than your thoughts. Not only that, but you are introverted, gentle, and rather humble. You embody all the traits of the perfect emo kid. You are a push-over, emotional, gentle to the extent of absurdity, and so humble that it even makes Jesus puke. If you write poetry, you no doubt write angsty, syrupy lines about depression, sadness, and other such redundant states of emo-being. Your personality is defective because you are too gentle, rather underconfident in yourself, decidely lacking in any rational thought, and also a bit too inhibited. 
<P>I probably made you cry, didn't I? Fucking Emo Kid. 
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational. 
<P>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I> 
<P><B>Compatibility:</B> 
<P>Your exact opposite is the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=100&score3=100"">Smartass</A>. 
<P>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=0&score1=100&score2=0&score3=0"">Hippie</A>, the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=0&score1=100&score2=0&score3=100"">Televangelist</A>, and the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=0&score1=0&score2=0&score3=100"">Starving Artist</A>. 
<P>* 
<P>* 
<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits.</I>

"event","timmay told me about the breaking benjamin concert probably about a month ago and i made him get me tickets. we thought they were for last weekend, and brian and i were getting ready and everything when timmay called me (on his way to my house) and had me look at the tickets cuz his said the 12th, when he asked for the 5th, and the lady giving them to him said the 5th. wtf. well they were for the 12th and i was all depressed cuz i really really wanted to go and i didnt think i could call off 2 saturdays in a row. luckilly george (my one boss) understood and let me have off this weekend too. and im so glad he did cuz i love love love breaking benjamin. brian, timmay and i got there after the first band went on (we had to go on a little cruise b/c *SOMEONE* thought they lost their id **cough cought TIM cough** but it was in the trunk all along lol) after wandering around for a little trying to see if we knew ne one and that sort of thing we parked our asses in the back by the bar and waited untill cassandra and becky showed up, which they did not too long after we did, and we all chilled n listened to the second band. dont know who they were but they were ok...i think lol. i wasnt really paying attention cuz i hadn't seen cassandra n becky in a while and catching up takes so much more effort when you're ill, but they sounded like they were mostly doing coveres of other bands....i dunno, i just wanted to hear BB. i started getting all woozy and whatnot cuz it was really hot and smokey and i couldnt stand for very long without wanting to vomit, so i sat in the far corner of the little pavillion thing with the comfy chairs that we were all standing by in the back cuz it was the only seat open and it also happened to have the best view of the stage, so the girls came in and sat on my chair with me and the boys stood outside in front of us. by the time breaking benjamin finally came on becky was so hot and tired and hungry (they came straight from work and didnt have time to do ne thing before-hand) that they left halfway thru the first song, which kinda sux and i would have spent more time talking to them if i had known they were gonna leave so soon, but oh well, ill just have to try to see them later. BB was just as good, if not better than i expected them to be. i knew all but one or two of the songs and managed not only to stand thru them but sing...no...yell along with them (which now my poor throat is making me pay dearly for) and just had an all around good time. i even called it when they came back for an encore (which brian didnt think they were gonna do, but i did) i just *knew* they were gonna come out and play rain...one of my favorites....and they did. i was so happy...then they played a few more before finally getting off for real and we all (even timmy) came home and crashed.....i just wish i werent sick though, i would have loved to get closer...like *right* up against the stage where all the action was...bottles of water, guitar picks, drum sticks and bodies were flying everywhere. it was so awesome lol. but yeah....i had lots of fun and the next time i hear about them being in the area u can be damn sure im gonna be there :)"

"event","montana west didnt appreciate me nearly as much as crock rock did. last night was a costume contest. most exotic costume won $500. i got a lot of compliments before hand, but when it came time to parade myself (and my bitch [brian was all chained up and being led by a big chain leash]) around on the dance floor, i hardly got any cheers....oh well, what do you expect. thugs dont wanna see freaks in their clubs, they wanna see bare ass. and ALOT of chicks had just that. bare freakin ass walking around. strawberry shortcake, french maids, playboy bunnies, nurses, witches in mesh and lengerie, all with their ass hanging out and bending over and showing everything. *sigh* big blow to the self esteem....this is why i *DONT* do that sort of thing....i hate the way it feels....so embarassing. i dont feel too bad though. the winner was this huge dude in a french maid outfit (and yes he showed off just like the girls). maybe id have done better if i showed off a little, but anyone who knows me KNOWS im not the type to go skaking my ass down a runway. i just dont do it...i feel ridiculous if i try. erg...oh well im just glad it was in quakertown and not allentown, i didnt know ne one there and they didnt know me....no harm no foul...could have really used that $500 though...oh well....never really expected to win in the first place. and now i have a nice little hangover to contend with....working 12-8 is gonna be SO much fun... ::rolls eyes::"

"event","KM last night so ABSOLUTELY rocked!! i had soooo much fun. my buddy radu hitched a ride with brian and me cuz he wanted to drink and he got arrested last weekend for falling asleep in his car waiting for the tow truck cuz he ran out of gas, with more than the legal limit in his system, and he didnt want to take the risk, and i can totally understand that. EVEYONE was eyeing me up and it was kinda wierd, but ok at the same time....cuz i felt HOT lol. one of the chick bartenders was hitting on me for a while (brian was RIGHT next to me cracking up) and i couldnt walk 5 feet without some one commenting on my outfit. i even had on drunk chick recommend a custom corsett maker out in jim thorpe....in the bathroom lol. but anyway. the bands were awesome, they all did a great job, and my friend austin (in Sic Cell....check it out) introduced Radu to kmfdm while they were all just chilling at the bar. Radu had made them a huge copper scull and given them a few small ones (they all had them clipped on during their set....he couldnt keep the silly grin off his face) and when sasha asked him what he could do for him....or how much he wanted for it, radu was just like ""Keep Makin' Music Man!!"" it was pretty funny...the night was a great success except for at the very end of the night when we were leaving. brians friends from anastasi's had come too and they were trying to kick chris out (who is 31-32) for being under age. he was pretty drunk and the one bouncer pushed him or grabbed his shirt and he *freaked* and 6 dudes jumped on him from out of no where. his girlfriend started screaming and all our friends jumped in and all got thrown out (including brian....) i wasnt happy....but what can you do. we would have stayed for the after party but (aside from being kicked out, lol) brian had to wake up early this morning, so we just bailed. it was a good night though, im so glad i could go."

"event","so i ended up NOT getting the job at the hartford. turns out i had a couple warrants out for my arrest for about the past 3 years....god damnit >.<  not like i didnt KNOW about them, i never did anything with my citations when i got arrested...i just thought it was long enough ago not to matter ne more lol, guess they did.
a couple days after i found out i wasnt gonna get it i went up to turkey hill and filled out an application again cuz i had already left the delivery company and there was NO WAY i was going back. then i called crawford up from the payphone there and was like ""ok i know i have these fines, i would like to come in and get this all resolved (preferably without getting arrested) is this a possibility...?"" and he was really nice and said ""sure just come in and talk to me and ill fix you up"" (not exactly but something to that effect). and i would like to take this time to thank timmay EVER so much cuz he came and got me after i woke him up at about 11 <b>*BUM*</b>. and took me over there, but he was at lunch so we had to come back later which kinda sucked cuz timmay was supposed to help some one move but being the wonderful friend he is he put it off and drove around with me and wasted time till we could go back (almost made him last for work [sorry dude :P] ). finally got to see crawford, all he did was ask me how old i was and i told him 21, added a couple things up and said i owed 373.00. he waived all the warrant fees and everything and charged me the minimum i could possibly pay. ROCK ON.
so now im all legal and everything and its nice. 
im back up at turkey hill for a while. i have to wait 6 months until i can re-apply at the hartford which is ok i guess. every one is SO happy to see me and they have me on day shift mostly. that was my one condition for comming back. i am NOT to be on at night, and if i am, im not alone. they had no problem with that concidering why i left in the first place...
i got my permit and im learning to drive! *EVERYBODY OFF THE SIDEWALKS!!!* lol. no im pretty good, i drive ok on the roads, its just pulling into parking spaces i have a little trouble with. the only problem is now i have to get a new one....and an id....and an SS# card..... 
i went to ocean city m.d. this weekend with brian and a his friend dougie and dougies g/f. we had a blast. we got down there friday night pretty late. got a room at 'bonita beach', pretty nice place. played cards and got drunk. then we decided to walk on the beach. it was gorgeous in the moonlight and there was a sandbar about 50 feet out so we had a nice little romp *on* the ocean lol. the only problem was about every 100 feet the waves had eroded the sandbar away from the undertow and we had to pick our way through waist deep water and craters in the sand....we got SOAKED but the water was really warm. i had so much fun. the next day we went down first thing and built a sand fort and went in the ocean, well brian and i went in, dougie and jill were being panseyasses and just watched....tid bit nippy but i hadent been to the shore in YEARS so there was no way i wasnt going in lol. later we rented mopeds. we were gonna rent wave runners but it was COLD and rainy and we couldnt find any places still open, being after the summer season and all, most places were closed. so anyway, got the mopeds and had SO much fun. we were out for an hour going up and down ALL the back roads and thru parking lots and just everywhere. the only PROBLEM was when we got back to return them i was minus my wallet. the damn thing fell out of my pocket SOMEWHERE down there, and there was absolutely no way we were gonna find it. i freaked out for a little while and finally called capital one and reported my card lost. that calmed me down a bit but it still sucked because we had planned to go to Secrets that night and there was no way i was getting in with out my id. oh well we had a good night ne way. they got a case of beer and i got a bottle of sambuka and we just stayed in and had a ball. fun fun. 
so now i need to make a new wallet and replace everything i had in it. this is gonna be such a pain in my ass but i guess it was worth it cuz i had a lot of fun loosing it lol....."

"event","so im getting a new job....
i finally decided enough was enough so i applied at the hartford (where my roomate works) and i got the job. well i assume i got the job....they said i did fine on all the tests and stuff and they liked me and the one chick even said ""ill see you on the 27th"" (when the training starts) but they havent called me back to confirm it yet....hopefully they will tomorrow...i already gave my 2 weeks at the other place...lol. 
tims all upset that im leaving. he asked me yesterday if robyn (his wife) was the reason i was leaving and i told him she was deffinetly a big part of it. shes such a BITCH. she treats everyone she comes in contact with like shit, and the funny thing is she is *nothing* at that company...she has NO importance....*I* can do my job AND hers and then some in one day and she acts like shes hot shit. the only power she has is because she happens to be married to the owner, there was also all the crap, tim trying to scam the truckers out of pay and what not...and i know hed do it to me if he got the chance. then theres the ""jokes"". i swear if i really wanted to i could put that company under just on sexual harrasmet charges....not to mention the civil suit i could take to the better business bureau for wages lost...
erg. 
hes going to write me up a letter of recomendation, which is pretty cool...and he gave me an open invitation to come back if i dont like it there. it was all i could do not to laugh in his face. even if i HATE it there i wont go back to this place. it was such a mistake. dont get me wrong it was kind of fun in a laid back - low class kind of way....i just cant do it anymore. 

i cut off my hair. it was really bad, i needed it. its not TOO short but it is pretty damn short. i like it. the chick that did it tried to dye my fronts black again, but it didnt take. she said i could come back in a couple days and shed do it again free of charge, but i never made it back. ill just do it myself eventually. 
got my physical the other day...goin up to pennDOT on wednesday to take my permit test. wish me luck. i know its sad....im 21 and i still dont drive, but im working on it.
okay....and thats my update...goodnight...wake up at 5 again tomorrow. fun fun. i cant wait til my new job...training starts at noon and once im really working i start at 1:30...i finally get to sleep in again!! yay!!! --nite"

""um...sure, when?"" ... ""now"" ... ""oh...ok...ill be up in a bit"" im glad i was already showered and pretty much ready. way to give me a little warning buddy! ::sigh:: oh well. so i got there, Tim showed me around, gave me a paper that had what i needed to say on it, gave me a packet of papers that had all the customers info on it and said ""ok...go ahead and start making calls"" O_O  
its not like there was anything really to train me on...but i didnt expect them to just throw me into it right away. my first 5 calls....i wanted to die, i was tripping ALL over my own tongue, forgot everything that was RIGHT in front of me, and generally made myself sound like a TOTAL raving idiot....but then i made a few more and it got easier...half an hr later, im wizzing thru calls like a pro :)
i need to be up at <b>5 am</b> tomorrow morning so i can get ready and walk my ass up to the bosses house so his wife can give me a ride in and i get to do it all over again. ... aaarrrrrggggg. i am NOT a morning person and i dont rememeber the last time i was up that early for ANYTHING...unless i was still up from the night before, but hes really helping me out with this...they dont even really have a possition open yet, so i cant really bitch, plus...not being able to drive tends to make things more difficult then they need to be. i REALLY need to start moving on getting my lisence god damn it. erg
i dont know how i feel about being a ""secretary"" yet...never quite saw myself       doing this...but hey, ill take anything...and its a lot safer then retail. i only met a couple of the people i work with but they seem nice. its a very laid back atmosphere, and i dont need to worry about taking smoke breaks cuz theres 3 ashtrays on every desk LOL...now THAT is cool"

ow ow ow ow *omg* ow
so bear with me....it got done at 1:30 and all that CRAP only *just* wore off 10 minutes ago. 
so yeah. yesterday was my last day at turkey hill. everyone was so sad to see me leave, 3 ppl wanted a hug, and 2 gave me money...LOL how funny is that. it sucks though because i liked working there. it was easy, all the customers were cool, and i could get away with murder....but such is life...
my face hurts and i cant swallow right. this is not fun. not at all. brian was supposed to take me today. i told him....no lie 8 times not to scheduel ne appointments today, so he could take me and be there for me....but he forgot ::rolls eyes:: lol. s'ok though, i know he has a lot on his mind, what with running his own business and all. he asked his mom to help out and she was glad to, so she picked me up and took me there only to find out i was locked out of the office because the *freakin DOCTOR* took everyone out to lunch. it wasnt even a common thing! they just HAD to pick the day i was comming. grr. thats ok...the only reason i know that is because one of the nurses from that office was sitting there waiting too. everyone was in such a hurry to get out, that when she was taking a patient downstairs, they forgot about her and locked HER out too. lol oh well. so i waited (and talked to brians mom about all kinds of crap) and waited (and talked some more...she couldnt get over what i was telling her about the robbery...she likes to ask alot of questions lol) and waited and FINALLY everyone came back...i told them i was there took off all my jewelry and whatnot, they took me back and got me ready stuck an iv in my HAND....and the next thing i know.....well, i dont really remember...i was in a bed and my face was cold and puffy, then i was in an elevator...then i was in the car, then i was getting out and brian was right there, then i slept for 3 hrs and now here i am.......fun
monday i get to start learning to be a secretary (if thats spelled right) woooooo freakin hoooooo. im sooo excited to start my new job NOT. bla, i always feel like this before i start a new job though. im sure ill get over it, and make the best of it. i really really need to start learning to drive though...oh yeah and btw....<b><big><big><big>OOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEE</big></big></big></b>"

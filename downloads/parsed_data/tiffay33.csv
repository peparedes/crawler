"event","Hmm, gah I'm at school again, not having to much fun. Kirsten went home early. And I need someone to talk to, but I just ahh I don't know. I don't want to seem like I'm complaining or anything but I'm just going through alot of shit right now. It may not seem like alot but it just feels like it, ya know? I want to run away... but I don't want to get in to much trouble. I don't think me getting in trouble would be that bad, because I'm just always getting in trouble, for something. And things at home couldn't get that much worse. My parents are constantally fighting, and it's all because of me. Blah, I'm just left speechless.Chris(my boyfriend)is helping me out alot. He just makes me so happy, and usually I'm just pretending to be happy, but he really makes me smile and mean it:)and he makes me laugh non-stop. He's just so ahh, I can't explain how I feel about him but I have a really good feeling with him!:) He's not like other guys. I think I'm being kinda Needy:|Hmm well please don't think I am, because I don't mean to be at all!! Okay enough about that, It's making me sad. Okay well I'm doing research on Enzyte(that natural male enhancement) Me and Jami are writing this big thing to them saying how much their product has put Charities into debt! I mean like the RedCross, because they really need money to help people. The people there really have big hearts<3!! I have alot of respect for them..well I have to go to lunch, so Later(L)(K)"

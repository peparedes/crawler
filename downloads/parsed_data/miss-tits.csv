"event","I don't get many things right the first time. In fact, I am told that a lot. Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls brought me here. Where was I before the day that I first saw your lovely face? Now I see it everyday and I know. What if I'd been born fifty years before you in a house on a street where you lived? Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike. Would I know? In a white sea of eyes I see one pair that I recognize. And I know. I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you. Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties and one day passed away in his sleep. And his wife; she stayed for a couple of days and passed away.

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong.
That I know.
That I am the luckiest."

"event","<b>The Land Of Nod</b>

From breakfast on all through the day
At home among my friends I stay;
But every night I go abroad
Afar into the land of Nod.

All by myself I have to go, 
With none to tell me what to do -
All alone beside the streams
And up the mountain-sides of dreams.

The strangest things are there for me,
Both things to eat and things to see,
And many frightening sights abroad
Till morning in the land of Nod.

Try as I like to find the way,
I never can get back by day,
Nor can remember plain and clear
The curious music that I hear.

<b>Robert Louis Stevenson</b>"

"event","A yawn resonates through the vocal chords of oblivion
Forcing itself to exhale its thoughts in a moment of pure genius.
By clearing the mind completely, it managed to avoid
backtracking through the history of the universe
regurgitating things that have already been said at least three times before.

It is truly original.
You aren't really original.
I wish I was original. 

It's funny how the coolest, most original kids are the ones that yawn the most.
People assume they're yawning because they're tired from being so cool all the time. I think they're yawning to clear their heads, it helps them stay original."

"event","People are strange, even when they're not strangers. 
I've come to a fairly safe conclusion, that when it comes to people I am not going to understand anything. Ever. Not even myself sometimes. 

In other news, mother reckons I should go up North and work on the mines. True story."

"event","This assignment is killing me... I have to make this character I drew in 3D. It's really hard!

He is a pot-bellied Viking/Hermit kid. I decided to give him a big helmet so I wouldn't have to model his eyes haha.

"event","I ended up staying out at uni wednesday night to help out my mate Grant and a few of the other MUBS (Monash Union of Berwick Students) board run a small Poker night. I probably regretted it towards the end of the night as it was just a whole lot of sitting around wasting time. But sometimes it's good to hang out with your mates and not do anything. 

On 3 hours sleep and no food however, I was struggling a bit. Grant and I went to Macca's but he got called back because they needed the rule book and noone knew where it was. So I was left to order for the both of us. Grant wanted a challenge and decided to go for the Pounder (4 quarter pounders in one burger) or as I like to think of it... heart attack in a burger.

Of course I got served by a trainee named Lauern, who didn't even understand the concept of a Pounder, let alone know how to put it into the till so we ended up getting it in a large meal for like $8.85 which is way cheaper than it's meant to be I think. 

After we finished up with the poker night (the winner ended up taking home $115, 2nd $60 odd and 3rd got their money back) and cleaned up Grant and I decided to stay on some of the couches on res in the student housing. 

When we got over there an asian dude neither of us knew was coming out for a smoke so we got in easy enough and went upstairs to see if Keegan was still awake. He wasn't, but we heard Shika (sp?) a girl that Grant knows well and some of her friends who live next to her making some noise so we went down there and listened to some music and chatted for a while. 

Shika lives in kind of a closed of group of 4 rooms with it's own living area there are 3 other girls living in those rooms with her, i don't know them though. The strangest thing about their living area was the incredible heat. I think it was mainly due to the fact that one of the girls was african and the rest had somehow managed to acclimatise but I swear they were sitting in a room that was at least 30 degrees celsius.

So after we were done annoying Shika and downloading Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (which we didn't end up watching,) we went out to the couches which we were going to sleep on for the night. 
They were small and hard and I had to bed my knees to more than 90 degrees to even be able to fit on it. We woke up right on time for class at 9. 
I had a really strong coffee in the student lounge and tried to wake myself up a bit for class.

The only class I have on thursdays is Digital Audio, and it's probably the favourite subject I do. Jerome the lecturer is really awesome with a good sense of humour and interesting views. 
We watched a video about how the big corporations have taken over the music industry and are screwing everything up. It was narrated (if that's the right word for it) by Thurston Moore from Sonic Youth and had input from artists like Ani DiFranco, Michael Franti from Spearhead and Chuck D from Public Enemy. 

It was a really good documentary and snapshot of what's happening with the music industry right now. Everybody should watch it, more people need to be aware of this kind of thing. I can't remember what it's called I'll try and find out. 

On a side note, I find it kind of ironic that Chuck D was speaking on this doco while Flavor Flav is off flaunting it on some VH1 reality show. 

I had hockey training on thursday night and it was a pretty slow session, but I tried to fire myself up a bit because we have our first final tomorrow and i want to win. 

Today I did pretty much nothing, except catch up on sleep big time, watched part of a Pixies DVD that I bought a while ago and babysat. I earned $30 and am now going to go and rest up for my final tomorrow.

Peace"

"event","Hmmm, I am struggling today. It would appear that I have lost my ability to stay up all night doing work. I need sleep. I ended up with three and a half hours last night animating a pirate walk cycle. If only I was Jack Bauer, then i'd be able to get everything done in 24 hours.

I am not normally one to pump myself full of caffeine, but today i've had 4 coffees and am about to go back for a fifth. I can't sit still. The light rain put me in a good mood when I was walking in it, but now i'm tired and pessimistic. 

Everybody keeps asking me what's wrong, they've been doing it all week. There is nothing wrong I am just quiet in the mornings! I like to think in the mornings, it takes a while to warm up into Everybody Loves Trent mode. That's just the way it is.

Mehdi, (pronounced Medi) an italian stallion from uni decided today he was going to start a religion that worships chickens. Funny guy. We decided that there was going to be a whole Scientology pyramid of worship where the more you pay us the more you get to learn about the religion, and only the highest echelon will know which came first, the chicken or the egg. 

I just got asked if I wanted to babysit on friday and saturday night for two different family friends so at least I will have a bit of cash for the weekend or next week. 

Borders at Chadstone were advertising for christmas staff the other day so I think I will apply this week. 

I started reading Bob Dylan's autobiography, which I gave Dad for his birthday and he finished reading, so far it's very interesting and gives you a good insight into his personality and lets you see where he was coming from as an artist. 

That's all I've got to say for today."

"event","I am Trent, I am not a blogger... but I claim this piece of space as my blog. *sticks flag in the ground*

I don't know how often, or for what purpose I will use this space... probably very sporadically and for a variety of uses, if at all. We shall see.

Anyway, I thought that I should get this blog off to a good start, so I waited until I had some good news, as the last month or so has been pretty stressful. With all the uni assignments due in, and then exams, and then finding out teachers had lost my assignments and i was going to fail if I didn't resubmit... yeah, pretty stressful.

Well anyway, I got through it all! Hoorah!
I've been pretty much assured by my lecturer's that I passed both my subjects. I even got a Distinction for one of my exams... SWEET!
Also I got a $200 tax rebate... hooray! (Now I just have to fill out the mountain of forms to get it)

Now I am on holidays and in need of a proper job, because besides the $200 which is yet to make it's way to my wallet, and the $35 dollars I made babysitting the other night, I am flat broke. So hopefully I will find something agreeable with me in the not too distant future. Because my brokeness is inhibiting my party time. :(

In other news, I am going to build an empire... it's going to be awesome. There will be more news when I have details. 

Thanks for reading."

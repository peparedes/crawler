<strong>Just Tiny Little Rocks</strong>

come quick
catch me while im still breathing
and ill draw more than just breath

youre sick
hugging porcelain, heaving
life hurts more than death

and you walk and you block out
but your life is in lock down
and your body;s a knockout
so who can you mock now?

youre gone
so call me awful leaving
write a note on my door

im wrong
so make it easy
make it how it was before.

well ive sucked every bit of this cigarette to the filter
i wonder if this one will kill her
i cant say that im wrong
until shes proven that shes right

"event","tonights <a href=""http://myspace.com/bruisesfromfightingrock"">bruises from fighting's</a> first practice with our new drummer eric. im kinda nervous to be honest. if this new drummer doesnt work out im not sure if bruises from fighting will exist anymore. it just doesnt make sense for me to keep recording these songs without a band or a hope of playing them live with a  band. who knows maybe ill go solo and just see what i can pull off. i definitely need to get better at guitar first. either way i hope this works out because if it does at all i think itll be really good. no songs right this second but i think ill post sometime soon. i gotta go reserve a practice room too. goddammit berklee why do you suck?"

"event","this ones called ""exactly what you want."" at least for now. another song i havent come up with a solid name for. im in need of a new acoustic quite badly right now. mine just sounds weird all the time now.

<strong>exactly what you want.</strong>
its a slideshow yknow
the snapshots come and go
some fade and some just change
but the differences remain

theres you changing your tune
on the measure you thought i forgot
to seperate the me and the you
and thats exactly what you want

these pictures cant prove anything
but a life i wish you lead

theres me hating the scene
where they took what i called mine
break off a piece of me
while i stumble down the finest line

i know i cant change anything
but the way i spend my time.

"event","this is a new one. im really not sure what to call it at all. its painfully obvious what this is all about really. theres not much to be said about it that isnt being said in the lyrics so ill just post em and at the bottom will be a link to download the rough acoustic version if you wanna hear what it sounds like at this point. enjoy.

<strong>fear and loathing in back bay</strong>
here you go steph
your name in a song
by the time you hear it i may be gone
reminiscent of times way back
when you didnt wanna hear about those others anymore

and i said is it just me or do we fit?
well its probably just me.
and you said what is wrong with us?
well its probably just me.

so tonight ill make candy shots
and ill savor every taste that gets you out of my mouth.
cuz i cant touch anything without your fingerprints on it
and im screaming just to get your voice out of my head.

and i said what is wrong with us?
well its probably just me.
and i said is it just me or do we fit?
well its probably just me.

and when i wake up ill just sleep the other way 
my heads gone south just like our fate.
can we make up? can you stare me in the face
tell me everythings ok?

here you go steph
our fate in a song
by the time you play it ill probably be gone
well you wrote it for me.
you dictated every step and all i did was copy it down

"event","Im keeping this Blog for the purposes of watching my songwriting get better and also sharing it with anyone who cares enough to listen. ill be posting lyrics and stories and links to downloads and updates on my bands myspace.  as my first entry im just going to kind of talk about where im at a little bit. not because i assume people would wonder. its for my own interest so when i look back i can see the patterns in my own behavior etc.

im studying to be an applecare technician. which is actually what i should be doing right now. 
i just recently decided to stop going to berklee college of music full time. it didnt leave me with enough time to write songs. i plan on going part time in the summers.
im having girfriend issues. always a songwriters best and worst position to be in.

thats about it though for now. next post will be the first song entry."

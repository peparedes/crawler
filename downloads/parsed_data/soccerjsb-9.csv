"event","Alrighty Part VII. Should be a good one, it's been a busy month and a half. 

To start off, about in the middle of May I finally moved out of my moms house. WooHoooo!! Gosh, I should have moved out a long time ago, haha... It's so nice just to come home and relax and not worry about parents for a change. Things are finally all settled in and in place. The apartment looks good.

The job is still going good. No problems, I guess. No one has come to me yet. So, that's good. YEAHHH!!!!

School went well this past semester. Got one ""A"" and two ""B's"". I was almost sweat'n Calc there I thought, but I guess not. Debating on this online class for Trig.. Three weeks in and I haven't really looked at any of it. Really really bad. I think, I'm going to drop it since I'm already behind. Just so busy moving in and my job so I don't lose it. I know, school is important and all, but might be a little bit of summer fever, haha. I don't know....

Okay, The real reason for this journal entry is that this damn ""selfish"" and ""complaining"" bullshit that still seems to come up in my life. I'm so sick and tired of it. I just can't seem to shake some of it off. Maybe, maybe that's just me. Who I am, maybe.  Well, we are all selfish in some kind of way when making a decision. I just want to get rid of some of it for myself. I've heard it for over Six damn years. When I sound selfish or controlling, maybe it's because all these damn chick's can't make up their damn mind and decisions and I have to do it for them when it comes down to doing something. But naahhh, that makes Jason being selfish and controlling. Screw it all. I just can't please anyone and make someone happy, I guess. Probably why I can't keep a chick. Whatever. 

Example, I said I would go visit someones grandmother with them and once I found out it was an hour away. I was like ""WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!"", but in the same since I was only joking. Once again, complaing and bitch'n and it sounded like I wasn't going to go then. I am going thou, geezzz.

On a good note finally. I hope it's good, haha. My friends Scott and Ashley got married over Memorial Day weekend. I was one of the Groomsman. Yep, that means I was in a Tux. hehe. Everything went well. I wish them the very best and a happy future together. Ya know what I mean, *buzz*???  wheeewwww, it's finally over. LOL...

Then it was off to the INDY 500 late saturday night. The race was awesome. Nothing like going 227mph in a car. Ahhh, what a dream. That would be so sweet to get into one of those car and just go go go.. haha Got a litte burnt in the sun thou, but hey, that happens every year. oh well.

Once again, the passion for soccer is still going. Signed up for outdoor soccer and doing indoor again on sunday nights still. Couldn't get any better....

I think, this is enough for now.
I'm out..."

"event","Well, it's the month of April. So, I guess I better fit in an entry, haha. 

I have been told lately that I'm too busy to have a girlfriend. There's some truth to that and not really.  First, if I had one. I have always put the girl first and have had made time. Secondly, right now I guess I really don't want one. Thirdly, some of the girls are either immature or too young. I want to step back and focus on my new job and my career path. I know when the time is right, it will come to me. Really boils down to, ""the girl is going to have to chase me right now."", haha. As Chi-town says, b.c. ""I'm a baller"", but I like ""I'm a Bachelor"" better.  I just need to do this for me and stick with it. Just friends for right now. I know it's going to be hard, but ""I can do anything once I put my mind to it.""  Gosh, I hate that line. Probably b.c. I hear it from my dad all the time.  

The new job is going really good. I'm glad that I took it. I keep expanding everyday I step into the building.  So far, I think I'm doing good work from creating a merchandise sheet for the company to give to the customers, new office floor plan and production drawings. Hey, ""When you got it, you got it."", haha. How's that new line honkey #2 ??, lol.. 

School is going okay too. Still worried about Calc, thou. Probably will come right down to the Final Exam if I will pass or not b.c. I need a ""C"" to transfer into my Purdue degree.  Web Design and Computer 3d modeling and animation are awesome. Piece of cake. Graphics just comes to me. So, if anybody needs something done hit me up. Could use the business.

Bought rims for my ""Shitty Saturn""(inside joke, haha) last week Wednesday.  I might say, they are growin on me, finally. Really sets the car off.

Soccer is Soccer, I guess.  Always will be, just that I love it so so much. I don't care what others say, ""that it's not a sport.""  I will put your money where your mouth is and explain the sport from a totally different view, trust me. lol..

It's getting late. Time to head to bed.
Hope everybody enjoyed themselves on this entry, haha."

"event","Alright people I'm back with a Part V of my episode.  Hope I can keep you interested, lol.  Wow, where to start.  I guess, the female situation, that's always interesting right? right! Because I'm a Bachlor, I guess. haha...  

Well, I met this girl, Jamie, back at the end of January. We got to know each other a lot the past 2 months, but things now are not doing so great, I think.  I give this girl everything I have and just can't trust her.  I guess, it's the guy intuition b.c. I've been burned in the past deeply. I haven't really talked to her much the past few days, something is up.  I give her the chance to come clean and I get silence.  I JUST KNOW, B.C ""I DO KNOW""!!!!!!!!!!  Pretty much it's going to end. I hate BF-liars. It's been a BIG pet-peeve since my very very past relationship when I would do alittle bit of it.  It doesn't get you anywhere. Ruins a lot for you, in general, relationships, and just anything you run into.  So, some advice, just think before you do it. Is it worth it, to lie?

The job thing, I know longer work for the ""Brown"" Company, UPS. haha....  It wasn't easy, but I had to do it. I felt sooooo secure there and the people were great, but I have found a job in my field doing CAD drafting at AMSAFE Commerical Products. We make aviation and commerical seats belts. I've been there for about 3 weeks now, going on 4 wks.  It's going pretty good. I like it and the pay is good, hehe.  Why else would I take the job. lol...

Soccer is going good. Still doing that on sunday nights.  Look'n to sign up for outdoor, maybe.  Have to stay in shape, haha.  

School, that's going okay. Nothing to big. Calc might be a problem, since I really need to pass so I can move on. uuuugggghhhh.  I'll get through school sometime.  I've been told thou I should skip graphics and go into PI, private investigator. lol.... Inside joke(honkey#2)

Finally got my HUGE settlement check from my shoulder injury. WOW, I can't be happier. Hopefully, this will be a good start. New job, school is kinda head'n the right way, and MONEY!!! hahaha jkjk. Really thou, that's bad. I have to deal with it the rest of my life since I have no right shoulder muscle.  Oh well, ""everything happens for a reason"".

So, on the last note. I think, I need to lay low on the dating scene. Some advice from a friend, ""It's probably just not your time, Jay."", ""It will come when the time is right.""  I guess, the girls can come to me.  Probably, should be focusing more on school anyway, lol...  I could honestly say that I have true friends.  Thanks everybody...

It's getting long. So, I hope this episode has kept you busy and has given you a break from whatever you were you doing. haha... Look foward to ""As Jason's World Turns, Part VI"". I'm sure there will be with this much drama in my life. lol lol"

"event","Well, I'm still alive everybody.  I've had somethings on my mind to talk about these past few months, but after tonight. I need to get stuff out.

To start with from a past few entries, for all who reads this. Janice and I are no longer togther. She somewhat lied to me about things.(I wont go into details, too long) We were both too much alike, I guess and I'll be blunt, a bitch. sorry!!!

So, I've been seeing what's out there. Going out on the weekends. About a few months ago I meet this girl, name Nicole at a bar. Yes, I know a bar. It's not really that bad. She's my age, 24. Blah blah blah. Thats all I'll say b.c. this is on the internet. She seems pretty cool, good job, etc...  I've been hanging with her a lot these past few weeks. Okay, here's the thing I'm getting flustered about.  She has a lot of guy friends. Which is cool and fine. I have a lot of female friends, no big deal. Right.  But the comment is that she's been around, around. somewhat.

I have some friends that say I should just shy her away b.c. of her actions. There are times that I really do b.c. I don't want to contend. I hate that shit. We are not even classified as couple, just dating. supposely or whatever! But we have been seeing a lot of each other and going out to the bars and clubs. So, what I am getting at is, do I continue or tell her we can't hang out anymore? Before things go to far b.c. I grasp that she doesn't quite feel the same way I do at times. She is moving in April for a new job promotion and we joke about me going with her. hahaha. right. hhhmmm.  I probably don't think so. We get along great, crack each other up, ya know. All the fun and exciting things. Days go by and we still bring the funniest shit up that happened like 2-3 days ago. lol It's like, this isn't helping me b.c. it's keeping me still around, to see her and hang out. Ughhh!!!

I'm not trying to be big on this part, but I've been told I'm a really good guy, funny, like to hang out with, respectful, caring and more but I don't want to carry on. Anyway, just that some really close female friends point this shit out to me and I'm like ""whoa, really? nah, get out of here. Not me."" and I know they are right there(the female friends), but I don't pursue things with them b.c. I can't get out of my shell sometimes(meaning-looks, figure- in a girl). They really would treat me well, really well and so would I. I think, some girls just dont appreciate it at times.  I'm willing just to put myself out there and do things for that other person. ya know. Also, for some of these girls or girls out there. Hello, the guy is right there infront of you or even a close guy friend. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

I just have the greatest friends. Look'n out for me. Which I can do on my own, but it's always nice to see them there besides you. getting this? haha

So, I'm stuck to this decision to maybe just end it with this girl, nicole. B.c. it's driving me crazy these past 1-2 weeks and thats not healthy. It just seems really hard. I can think it, but can't probably do it and I probably need to. Just let this one slip away, I guess. So, whom-ever reads this. Have any advice? Just drop a comment, please and thanks!!

School started back up last week. It's going to be a blast. I have a Web Design and a Computer 3d Modeling and Animation class. Piece of Cake!!! lol and Then I have Calculus, Yuk!!! haha

Indoor soccer is still going on for me. I love it sooooo much. Probably the only thing that keeps me going through the week. Just waiting when the next game and the next game is going to be week after week. 

Then there is work, UPS. ""We have the technolgy"", ""We have the planes"" and there's more. haha But ""What can brown do for you?"" I've been back to work from these past 2 months b.c. I was put on disability for awhile b.c. of my shoulder. Speaking of that, the shoulder is hold'n up okay. It has it's day but what can you say when there is NO muscle on my right shoulder blade.  Suck it up and move on!!!

I'm getting tired and have to get up in a few hours for church. This should keep people of to date for awhile, haha.. ENJOY!!!! MORE TO COME!!!"

  ""YOU""

I know ""YOU"" are different
That's what makes you, ""YOU"".

I gave it a shot 
because it's something new
Is that cool with ""YOU""?

I don't know what to do or
What even started this.
Because I don't want to lose ""YOU"".

I know ""YOU"" are confused and
Don't know what else to do either.
Just think about and
It might come back to ""YOU"".

I'm willingly to give it my all
As I am falling for ""YOU""

I know whatever I say
May not help in anyway.
But just think what this might do
If ""YOU"" do.

It might work or it may not.
But that's the chance/risk ""YOU"" have to take
Or ""You will never know!!""
Take it day-by-day.

If it may not then
Let it be part of a life learning experience.
It's just part of life, ya know.
It's A-O-KAY!!

I'm getting empty now.
As ""YOU"" are not there to fulfill it.
So I guess, I'll stay on empty for awhile
Till I get over it."

and I guess I have a lot on my mind tonight. Shoulder surgery went well a few weeks ago. It's alittle sore but I'll survive. I see the Doc Nov. 2nd to see whats up then. Maybe back to work, maybe not. No, soccer as of right now, bummer.

I'm going to go back to a song, like waaay back. It's a classic, called ""Sweet Lady"" by Tyrese. Goes like this...

[Intro]
Oh, give it
Be my sweet lady, wweet lady
Oh, I want you to be my lady, lady
Oh babe

1 - 	Sweet lady 
	Would you be my 
	Sweet love for a lifetime
	I'll be there when you need me 
	Just call and receive me

Now any other day I would play it cool
But I can't now cuz I want you 
See I'm hooked on how you flex your style
And I wanna talk for a little while
I never really seen your type
But I must admit that I kinda like
So maybe if you have the time 
We can talk about you being my

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Now on the regular I would waste time
But I don't want to cuz you're so damn fine
And I heard that you were taken
That don't have to stop you from makin'
Late night phone calls on the telephone
About your fantasies and how to get it on
When you need me I will be there for you
My Sweet Lady

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Say you will be my baby
Say you will be my lady
I've got to have all your love
So I won't even front
Just say you'll give it to me
I don't wanna hear the maybe's
And I will give you all my heart
If you say you'll be my sweet lady

Repeat 1 until fade


So, anyway. I'm tired of the same line everytime, ""I just want to be friends or whatever."" I guess, it's a pet-peeve of mine. Maybe, I will never find the right girl or am I looking too hard? maybe. I'm just myself nice, outgoing, good sense humor, easy to get along with I think, lot to offer and whatever else. I'm just very laid back and go with flow. It's a lot easier and not make things so so difficult. I just want to be with a ""Sweet lady"". Do stuff with, hang out, movies, dinner, laugh, joke around, cuddle and etc... I know, there are bumps along the way, but hey, it happens. 

Well, janice and I are up and down like a roller coaster, it seems like. I don't know if that's good or bad. Is it healthy? I don't know what to call it if it's arguing, disagreements, or not getting along. I mean, don't get me wrong I like spend'n time with the girl. She's great in her very little way. Just different at times. and

Touchy topic here, how is intamacy not as important to someone. It's a chance to become closer to that person physically and emotionally in a essential way. I know, a relationship shouldn't be evolved around it, but it's a great thing to have and I also know their are different ways to ""connect"", but come on. I just don't get it!! I know I don't want to give up just that easy. I guess, if things are for the best then it's for the best.

I just don't know what it is. I have this feeling I'll never fall in love again and find that someone. How will I ever know or feel it? any suggestion?  That being alone sucks.  Maybe, I'm affraid of trying it. Heck, my aunt has never been married and a lot of people say I look like her. haha..   Might mean something, things in common, or not... haha, Be like her when I'm older, single and working. Who knows.

That's it for now. It's getting late. More thoughts later... Nite"

"event","Alright, Doctor after Doctor visits, I found out today that I'm going to have surgery on my right shoulder finally. I have two things going on with my shoulder. One, a Shoulder Impingement Syndrome which ""is a condition that affects the rotator cuff, causing shoulder pain. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that secures the arm to the shoulder joint and allows the arm to rotate."" Basically to the point, when I raise my arm above shoulder level that my tendons are getting pinge causing pain because the tendons have nowhere else to move.

Second, is that I have nerve damage to the shoulder blade muscles, the supra and infra muscles. Those muscles are pretty much dead and they are not going to come back at ALL. Nothing they can do there.

If anyone wants to read up about it just check these websites out. It's quite interesting. Just rollover the words. <a href=""http://www.hmc.psu.edu/healthinfo/i/impingementsyndrome.htm"" target=""_blank"">Impingement 
Syndrome </a>, <a href=""http://www.aafp.org/afp/980215ap/fongemie.html"" target=""_blank"">Artical #2</a>, <a href=""http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/shoulder/a/shoulder4.htm"" target=""_blank"">Artical #3</a>. It will take forever for me to explain everything.

I'm kind of scared to have it done, because I have never had surgery before in my life. But if it will AT LEAST give me some relief I'll be happy. IF it doesn't, then I'll look at it as I'm in the same position. So, what's the difference, maybe. I'll probably will not return back to UPS for work just because of the constant lifting all the time. Which sucks, cuz I loved my job very much and those DAMN commericals. LOL. I'll probably will be on disability for awhile(injured it at work) and when that runs out I'm pretty sure I will have to sign a waiver and get a settlement. If that ends up happening then I just might give up before hand cuz I can not handle these crap disability checks for any much longer. I will take the pain and suffer for another job to start making better money. ya know! Cuz this ""Honkey has to pay somethings off."" haha.

It's all just so emotional and draining. Do I do the surgery or Do I not?  Some poeple say I shouldn't cuz, ""What if it doesn't help?"" But how will I ever know if it will make a difference in the long run????? I wonder WHY, WHY me? I'm too young to have this problem. I know it. The doc even said so. I just hate the line ""Everything happens for a reason."" So, True or am I wrong? *shrug*

Well, I guess on a good note. My summer has been pretty good. Hang'n out with my friends, Scott, Ashley, Vittoria, Matt, Christina, Kirk and of course Janice. The lake has been a BLAST. Man, I need a Ska-Do(inside joke) haha.. Just alittle NOTE: Never forget who your TRUE friends are and Pick wisely!!

I'm still doing indoor soccer, but not for awhile it looks like. huh. But its going good. Scott and I put a Team together these past 2 session. Quite happy on the Team, I might add.

Back-to-School, oh great, NOT. I have this one foreign teacher that speaks broken English. So you have to sit there and fill in the rest of the words. IT SUCKS. My Trig class is alright. An Exam is coming up in two weeks. We'll see how well I'm doing by then, eh?

What else. I miss my dad. He's going through some health issues that concern me a lot. Especially, that he is getting older. Sounds like the both of use aren't doing very well. hehe. Can anything else possibly get worse? Hopefully, I get to go to FL in Dec. for my step brothers Graduation. Then the whole fam. will be there and I haven't seen my step bro in like ages.

I think thats it for now. 
(Part III) coming soon... haha"

"event","Wow, two journal entries in one week. I probably should write in this thing more often to get somethings off my chest. Probably would feel alittle relief off my shoulders.

Work sucked this morning. I got 4 add-ons which is a bunch of crap, on my one truck. Which usually isnt normal. Oh well, got to make that money somehow.

I found out that one of my female friends likes me through one of her co-workers. I thought she saw me and her as just friends, guess not. I never saw it coming. Well, I saw some small hints, maybe. Geez, this female situation is driving me crazy. Something has to give. I'm not trying to be big on myself, but I have been told I'm a great guy, nice, good sense of humor, funny and anything above. WTF, is the matter then. I guess, I must be asking for too much lately. Who knows. Forget it, let things ride for awhile.

I talked to my dad recently. Not sure in the worse case of moving to Cali or not. He said, ""Wouldnt be a question of saying, NO."" Just depends on this business proposal he's got going on for him. If he would have to move closer to this new Community College project site, in Cali. It's not looking too good, he says, I think. I just have to keep doing my part of finding out info and keep moving on to whatever.

That's it for now.

"event","Alright everybody out there that has been given me grief on how long it has been for a journal entry. Well, here you go. Sit back, relax and enjoy because you are in a for along one.

Let's see if I can start off from the last entry. 

On some good notes...

School went very well this spring semester. I think, in math i got a ""B"" and in my AutoCad i got an ""A"". I guess, I should check online to see what I got, but it doesnt help when you cant log in. haha I'm currently not taking any class for the first summer session because the next math class isnt offered. So, i get to enjoy part of my summer, right? Damn straight!!! YaaaaaaaaaYYYYY!! 

Next, indoor soccer has been going great. We just finished up Summer Session One up. We did alright, but we still suck. I guess, all that counts is going out there and playing the game I love to play since i was five years old. Summer 2 or Mid Summer Session will be starting up soon. That will keep me busy again for awhile.

Work is still going pretty good. Still doin the UPS thing. ""What can brown do for you""

Memorial Day Weekend was a BLAST!!! Went to the Indy 500 like I always do since i was kid. My Dad, came in from Cali this year. Which was cool. Him and I had a great time, father and son bonding time... Drank a lot, golfed on saturday, drink, race was sunday, drink and drink. Oh yea, did i say drink some more. haha

Lately, i have been hanging out with my friends Scott and My Pal(Ashley).. We all get along great, crack up jokes and just have a good time. Everybody needs friends like them. Only if you just knew them two. They are great. There is one more friend in there. I'll save that for last. hehe

Let's see... Some bad points...

My mom and I are still fighting. She keeps threatning to kick me out because she thinks it's time for me to be on my own. Well, I dont think so. The big part, I'm not financially stable to move out. My dad and i talked about it over Memorial Day weekend and came up with some solution. One and last solution would be to move out to California with him and finish up college there. It would be nice, let me tell ya. Sunny blue skies, palm trees, golf, 70-80 degree weather everyday, golf(haha), flowers, mountains, ocean, and the beach. The list could go on. lol..  Just makes me upset why my mom is the way she is. I moved once, I'll do it twice because of this crap. Sorry, it has to come out that way, but ""It's all a bunch of shit.""(inside joke)haha... Lately, she has calmed down, but is pushing to get a second job now. Gosh, it just doesnt stop doesnt? NOPE!! I could kind of just pick up and GO... We'll see...

Another, I have a ""DOMER""(ND student) friend that just doesnt seem to think who his true friends are. I guess, that's what will happen when you go to the Univeristy of Notre Dame and think they have everything figured out in life. WRONG!!!! 
""Or something like that..."" You might read this. You might not. A work inside joke, ""What do i care."" Kind of goes back to your saying, ""If you dont need me, then I dont need you."" Whatever dude. Have a Good life man...

My shoulder still hurts. I finally went to see my doctor today. He said, ""I need to get an MRI."" GREAT!!!! I'm not really high on this crap. I'm afraid my should is done for. That it's going to be messed up for the rest of my life... ugh...

Now, for all you've probably been waiting for is the Female situation. haha
Scott and Ashley introduced me to their best friend, Vittoria. ""What up Honky?"" lol.. She's really nice, kind, easy to get along with, good sense of humor, funny, and very pretty. Lately, just been hangin out with her. Getting to know one another, making inside jokes and starting as Friends. Thats all you can do in the beginning, right? Well, thats what some advice my mom has given me. I guess you can say we are dating,(I think...) but not serious. Soooo.....

I hope everybody was entertained and had fun reading. lol
I'm out..."

"event","I guess it's time to update this thing. I'll back up a few weeks ago. Spring break in March was awesome, I went to Dallas, Tx to visit my aunt. Played some golf, drink alittle, more golf, drink some more, and maybe golf again. No, we did more stuff than that. Went to the Dallas Mav's game one night, Mideval Times another and stayed home some nights for some home cook'n, yuuummmmmmm.

School is going pretty good still. I think, I got A's in my two classes I am taking this semester.  I just love my AutoCad class. Of course, duh, that's the stuff I want to do and as well as Graphics for a liviing. haha

Indoor soccer is just great. This session is going okay. We have lost all of our games, but that doesn't matter as long as I score a lot of goals per game. Also, to just go out and have fun at the sport I love to play the most.

Female situation, ugh... is not going well. I think, I just need to take it easy for awhile. I guess, I'm not ready for a steady, serious relationship right now or make anything offical. I mean, what's wrong with just hanging out with someone special and getting to know one another for awhile, enjoy spending time together and knowing by just doing the little things together is enough, for the time being. I think, by doing some of this only makes the heart grow fonder and will make things stronger to build for the next level. Yes, I understand at one point in time things will be needed to be taken to awhole another level. Does it need to be right away, thou? Who knows. Dont get me wrong, I was enjoying every little bit of it and something just blew up to think otherwise. I'm just so Korned confused, I guess. I'm only human, sorry.

well, we will see where this leads now, maybe a response, maybe not. 
For now, later."

"event","Well, what do you all think of my new journal page? Leave a comment or IM me online. Thanks for helping me Rach.

I guess, I have a lot of catch'n up to do. Back in January and beginning of Febuary, I hurt my right shoulder really bad at work. I got to do light work for about a week and half, hehe. It still hurts alittle bit. I can only reach so high with it right now. I still think something is wrong with it, but for the most part I can still left boxes at work. ""What can my last name(brown) do for you?"" haha

Let's see, also in Jan. and Feb. I helped Sabra paint their house they are fixing up. Gosh, what a job, but we got it all done. Just hang'n with her and do'n stuff. Might be bumpy here and there, but nothing to get worked up over.

Now onto school, School is going pretty this semester. My math is just great. Get to use notes and homework on tests, no midterm and note cards on the Final Exam. Can't get better than that, haha. Anyway thou, First test, ""c"". Second, ""b"". Third, ""a"". Fourth, ""?"", but looks good. We'll see when i get back from Spring Break. My AutoCAD(computer aided drafting) class is going well, of course, but hey, what can I say? ""B/c I got it like that."" haha. I have a ""b"" and ranked 2 of 5, in the class. Hopefully, and striving to be that 1 of 5. lol

Now, I'm on Spring Break, March 5th-14th. My drive to Indianopolis, IN was nice and it was great to see other family, The Indy Family, for the Races every year. The kids are getting so big and smart. My flight, that I was more concerned about was excellent. I made it safely. ""Spend'n My Time""(song, N/M), anyway, in Dallas, TX visiting my Aunt. 70 degree weather and sunny everyday, YEAH!!!!!!!!! Brought the golf clubs too. So, hopefully to get some golf in this week.

Best for last, for the thing I love to do, play, passion and enjoy, Soccer. I've been doing indoor soccer lately at Soccer Zone. I did 2nd session in Jan. and Feb.. It was so much fun that I signed up for 3rd session too.

I guess, by looking at this Entry, everything is going good, but at times it seems like they are not. Hmmmm, whats up with that? I say. Part of life!!

Enjoy everybody!"

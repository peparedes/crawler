It took me forever and a half (ehh a few days) to remember the password to this journal. I wanted to pop in and let all of you know that I'm going to start using LJ again, under <lj user=""avoir_faim"">. Just comment on the public entry if you still want to read all of this, and I'll add you.

A lot has gone on in the past year or so, but I think I can basically sum it up in two main points:

+ I got my second degree black belt in January.
+ I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in August.

Getting my second degree was crazy, karate still takes up my life for the most part. A lot of people who congratulated me that day were in tears because they knew how much I went through to get it. It was a pretty huge thing for me.

Getting diagnosed with UC was even more huge, oh man. I had been extremely sick for that entire summer, but was too stubborn to tell anyone about it. I ended up getting hospitalized for the first week of school, after I had a few tests done. Basically, I have a bunch of ulcers hanging out in my colon that are never going to go away. They bleed and just generally make my life more difficult, it's not a fun time. I take 30+ pills a day and am on this crack baby of a diet to try to control it, but there's no current cure and I'll deal with it for the rest of my life. That's enough to shake anyone up, really.

So if you want to jump back into this, feel free. I miss you guys! :)"

When I had said that I was beginning to settle into my high school schedule a bit, I lied. Horribly. That is, I wasn't anticipating track to suck away every waking moment of my life. I can't do anything on weekdays, anymore. They've descended into a state of going through the motions, each day exactly like the last, as I simply don't have the time to sit down and analyze them. I wake up, make myself a cup of tea, and take a shower. Half an hour of stretching, taking various diet supplements and vitamins, and drinking 89762346786 bottles of water comes next. I eat a piece of fruit, get dressed, grab my books, and run out the door. School, where I make an honest effort not to explode on everyone. This doesn't always work, as Allison and Lea unfortunately found out on the bus. Such stupid things push me off the edge, I hate it, and I really am sorry for it. I wouldn't want to be around myself, as I am. Immediately after school is track practice, which lasts two and a half hours. I get home at five, which leaves me just enough time to jump in the shower, slip into my uniform, and get to karate. I'm at karate until nine-thirty or ten, at which point I'm just about murdered. I get home, another half hour of stretching, and the homework. It does itself each night, I'm not certain as to how. After my homework is done, I drag myself upstairs, into bed, to wake the next morning and do all of it again.

I have no time to <i>think</i>. And I'm going insane for it. I need to be able to pull everything apart, analyze it from every angle, dwell on it. That's just what I do. It gives me a sense of self, I know where I stand on everything, so when it comes, I'm ready for it. I'm not, anymore. I need to think as things come, react as they happen. And I can't do that. It just doesn't work."

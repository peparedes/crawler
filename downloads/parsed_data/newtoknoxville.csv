"event","Well Hurricanne Katrina Has come and gone, but the devastion in the city is still there. Lives have been lost and changed and in some ways will never be the same. For some people Hurricanne Katrina is still going on. My prayers go out to all that was affected by the storm. Well Mardi Gras in New Orleans did go on and it was a blast. The came from near and far to support the city. As the hours past the people waited for the parades, drank and had fun. You saw people laughing and talking not even thinking about a storm that had just passed stolen what some people have worked really hard for. No one mope or growned. Instead they laughed and yelled to the floats as they passed "" Throw Me Something Mr."" They even held up signs that we We will come home. We will Rebuild. What a time it was. I'm now back in Houston now which is where I will reside for the next two years. I left New Orleans at 2:30 am to drive here, had to be in class for 9am. Man I'm tired but it was well worth it. I got to spend time with my bestfriend Ali. WE had so much fun together. She's great and I love her to death."

"event","Well today is another day that god has blessed me to see and for that I'm forever greatful. It's been a long time since I have been on here but hey im back. WEll i still live in the same city, with the same job , attending the same school. I was in a realtionship but as we all know men are dogs(yes we are) and can't be trusted no futher than we can see them. I realize that what im looking for in a man i have it all in Jesus and the good thing about him is that he will always be there for me and never let me down. Well just for the record, im dating this guy by the name of Mr Alphonso Morgan you can look him up at www.alphonsomorgan.com, any way let say im sorry that i met him. Ya know people always tell you what you wanna here to get what they want. WEll for Mr Morgan , he did all that he could do to get me, he pretended to be someone that he wasn't, he hid habits that he had and secrets that he knew that i wouldn't approve of. But the bad thing about this is that i asked him about these things and he lied to me and say No thats not me. Well now im in Love , in Love with a man that i really dont know who he is. He thought it was a good idea for him to keep Messiah , Messiah is my dog , one like Paris Hilton has. well he has Messaih in New York with him and im so sick because i miss them both very much. Im upset because Alphonso has been doing drugs alot lately and his attention spand for me has become very short. The drug habit has really gotten to me and the fact that he is not taking care of Messaih like he should is killing me. Messiah needs to go to the vet and he has not taken him yet, he's not waering his flee colar, etc. it's just bad. Well the bad thing is that now Mr. Morgan is not even answering any of my call, i feel so stupid for putting my trust in this so called Man and look once again i have been let down. And the fact that I trusted him with my dog really makes me feel stupid. I cant beleive he ran off with my Dog. but ya know the Bible say that we reap what we sow , so Mr Morgan you will get yours and when you do it wont be pretty. I just cant believe that i have allowed this to happen to me again, but its ok  i'll just pray and asked God to give me a peace of mind about this. Well that my story  for today."

"event","Well truely i must say that God is Good. Over the past couple of months I have experienced some strange obsticles in my life. I mean all kinds of stuff have been happening to me. I so glad that even on today as I rite in my journal i can say that it has been a learning experience. I'm so glad that I can stand and say that it was threw the grace of God that i have not given up. Because I know know at this point in my life that trails come , tribulation come and test come but God said that we have been made endure for night but joy comes in the morning. if the devil could have killed me he would have by now. I trust and beleive God that no matter what I may  go threw in life he will see me threw. God says if we keep his commandment that he would be with us until the ends of the world and in him i put my trust. He has never failed me yet. What a mighty Godvwe I serve. A God that supplies all my need , a God that has been my waymaker,  burdun bearer, a mind regulator, a God that has all power. All to him i owe. I have learn not to only praise him  when all is well  but when all hell is lose, when it seem like there is no tommorrow , when it seems like i have nobody that i can turn too."

"event","What a drag. Today i sat around in my apartment and did absolutely nothing, just sat there all day. Hope i dont't have another one like this soon. My cousin is here from my home town  but that didn't help any cause he is always on the phone with someone or he's sleep. I felt kind bad toward the end of the day cause i had done nothing but sit around all day  wheni could have been in the word, growing in the things of GOd. So i had  my lil praise break, it was good too. I beleive that God will put no more on us then we can bare. Most people think that when trouble or trails come into there life that it's the devil , well could it be God. Ya know the biblr says we reep what we saop(did i spell that right lol ) so it could may well be that we cause the trail  or whatever. When hardship  come we should first find out or ask God is it something that i did to cause this and if so immediately repent for the it. Or is it cause God that has you going threw and if so we should ask GOd what is it that he wants you to learn from it. I beleive that God will let us go threw some thing in order to either stretch us, test our faith ,and so that we may grow. Sometime were put into certain situations to see if we can endure the the storm, you see God already know the end result  but its for us to see our strenght, to reconize God's power ,, is love for us. And when its all done who do we have to thank. That's right God. Like my  bishop says "" it's kinda a set back for a come back"". I have been threw many storms and tribulations  but i know that God is a present help in the time of trouble and if i keep my mind stayed on him he will keep me perfect peace. With me being a christain when i go threw certain sitiautions, in the beginning i count it all joy cause i know that my God will come to myt aid as long as  i beleive in him, just a lil faith. I tell my best friend all the time live for God for with him all things are possible. Hardship and all with still come but there are great benifit, such as peace , joy, happiness , he can be a comforter ,a healer, a deliver, and he promised us that we can have riches and lands , he said that we should live a prosperpous life , he said that  he would take care of our families so that they may be blessed  if we obey his words and keep his commandments. Lord I thank you for the oppuurtunity  to be in your presence , in your presence is where i find joy, peace and happiness, i pray that you would continue to shine you light on me say that i may minister to your people O God , have you way in and threw me so that you may be glorified, the saint will be edified and lost soul will come to repenence. in Jesus name i pray AMEN."

"event","Well a week has gone by  and i'm settled in my apartment. I must say i'm very proud of myself cause the apartment looks real  nice. I said that i would invite my co-workers over for my birthday just so that i would have something to doon it. Tommorrow i leave for Atlanta but i'm not sure if i want to go cause i may have to go alone, even though last yrs i went alone and i had so much fun. This year i'm staying at the Ritz carlton  so that should be real exciting. Th i have some friends that are staying across the street from me, so i may chill with them. Let me just say that God is so Good, Io mean really he is  and so many times we take that for granted  with all that he does for us. God has been showing me somethingsin my life that going to take place and i'm  going to have no one but him to depend on. And that is fine cause i know with him all things are possible and he will out know more on me than i can bared ifGod has me going threw its for a reason  but when its all over, only he willnget the praise and glory. Lord what ever it is that you would have me to go threw thenim  willing. people often why you into church so much why, you always taking about Jesus. My response iss because i know that  it is threw him we haveour very being . The word says if i keeep my mind stayed on hin then he will keep me in a perfect peace"

WE HAD ALOT OF FUN BEING THAT I HAVENT LIVED WITH MY MOTHER SINCE I LEFT HOME FOR COLLEGE WHICH WAS LIKE 8YRS AGO AND TO HAVE TO COME IN MY HOME  AND STAY FOR A WEEK WAS JUST LIKE OLD TIMES. SO KNOW SHE HAS LEFT BUT SHE BE BACK FOR THE ACTUAL MOVE WHICH TAKES PLACE ON TUESDAY, IM MOVING ACROSS THE STREET WHICH IS LIKE A 1000 FEET AWAY, ALSO THAT KINDA GOOD CAUSE I DONT NEED A TRUCK OR ANYTHING, IM RENTING JUST A DOLLY LOL. WE ARE GOING TO WALK EVERYTHING RIGHT OVER. IM REALLY EXCITED, I FEEL LIKE ONCE IM ALL MOVED IN MY LIFE WILL START TO BECOME MORE SETTLED AND AT EASE.ENOUGH ABOUT THE MOVE. TODAY I WENT TO CHURCH AND IT WAS SO GOOD , BISHOP PREACH ON FAMILY AND HOPE BLESSING OVER YOUR FAMILY LIFE STARTS WITH THE HEAD WHICH IS YOUR PARENTS. THE BIBLE SAY THAT IF OUR PARENT WOULD FOLLOW THE COMMANDMENT THAT GOD SET FOR THEM THEN  THERE FAMILIES WOULD BE BLESSED , HE TALK ABOUT HAVING OUR PRORITIES IN ORDER ABOUT PUTTING GOD FIRST IN OUR LIVES BECAUSE THATS WHERE HE BELONGS. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE BEGAN TO PUT HIM FIRST THEN OUR LIVES BEGAN TO FALL IN ORDER. LISTEN TO THIS SAYING  AND SEE IF WE CAN APPLY  THIS TO UR LIVES THIS IS WHAT MOST CHRISTIAN OR PEOPLE IN GENERAL DO. WE TREAT GOD LIKE A SPARE TIRE , WHERE DO U KEEP A SPARE, IN THE TRUNK, BUT WHEN WE GO FLAT WE TAKE HIM OUT , AND WE USE HIM UNTIL WE GET SOMETHING WHICH IS GOOD SUCH AS A NEW TIRE  WE PUT THE SPARE BACK IN TO THE TRUNK . MY GOD THAT IS SO STRONG  WE NEEED TO PUT GOD WHERE HE BELONGS  AND THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST IN OUR LIVES . I TOLD MY BEST FRIEND TODAY THAT AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE IM SO STRONG IN MY FAITH THAT I HAVE THE BELIEF THAT GOD IF YOU DONT DO IT CANT BE DONE , IF YOU DONT MAKE IT HAPPEN IT CANT GET DONE. GOD IS ON A MOVE IN MY  LIFE HE IS SHOWING ME THINGS THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE FOR THE BUILD ING OF HIS KINGDOM, HE'S PUT A DREAM ON THE INSIDE OF ME AND IWILL KEEP ON SPEAKING IT , SPEAKING IT , SPEAKING IT UNTIL I SEE IT SEE IT SEE IT .. JESUS. TODAY GOD GAVE ME A WORD FOR MY BEST FRIEND IT WAS SO AWESOME THE SPIRIT REALLY MOVED THROUGH ME TO SPEAK TO  HIM . AT FIRST HE WAS HARDEND TO THE WORD BUT THEN I BEGAN TO ASK GOD TO SOFTEN HIM TO THE WORD , FOR HIM TO BECOME SENSITIVE TO THE WORD AND HE DID , THEN GOD TOLD ME TO TELL HIM  TO PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS CHEST  AND BELIEVE HIM  WHILE I PRAY BLESSING OVER HIS LIFE.  O IT WAS A WONDERFUL TIME I THINK THAT HE WAS TOUCHED IN A SPECIAL WAY. . WELL IM  AT WORK   AND NEED TO GET BACK BUT I WILL BE BACK TO UPDATE YOU ALL ON WHAT GOD IS DOING UNTIL THEN BE BLESSED."

"event","Well one again I thankGod for this day that he has blessed me to see. Well i started my day  by calling  home  to  how  my  mother was doing  and she was fine .  Then  i went to  the mall and  i saw this guy  that  i had saw in  church on Sunday .  I was  going to say hello to him  when i saw him  but  i said  nah .  He  was at the bus stop when  i saw him .  I went into the mall and went in to Structure  to see what they  had  and i saw that same guy  pass by the store , so i continued  on .  I  didn't buy anything from there so  i made my way  down to  dillards cause that's  my store and i knew i would find something there.  And  i did  i bought a pair of black dress shoes .  i saw that  same  guy  again  , at that  point  i figured he was following  me  but still i didn't stop to  talk to him  . I  just figured it was strange for him to follow me  all that time and not say anything .   well i left  the mall and was on  y  way  home , my  friend Kenneth called me  from back  home   , he was telling  me how much  fun  he has in ATL .  well now  im  back  at home bored .  I'm  really  really  getting depressed cause  i feel  like im  here all alone and  i don't know anyone  , i mean  all i do  is sit in the house . Me and  my roommate is always fussing  and that doesn't make anything better .  Right  now all i want to do is go back to Louisiana .  Tomorrow is  my  birthday  and  i can't spend it with  friend s and family , this one is really  going to suck .  I told them all if they  don't call me that i was speaking to them for a weak . Well this is my  story  for today .  i guess I'll go get a hair cut and get  my  eyebrow outline  and make  my self beautiful .  so  i can  look at my self in the mirror .  maybe  on  tomorrow me and  my  my  will webcam , maybe that'll make me feel better . well i have to go  so  Be Blessed.  Fred"

"event","This  morning I woke up really excited . Just excited to  be alive  and I thank God . I woke up this morning and ask God to bless me  with a fresh anointing . After that  I had to get up and rush to get ready for  church . Ya know the devil come to kill , steal and destroy and the bible says that we have to be aware of his doings because he will try to hinder us when ever he feels he can . As I went to get into my car  there was  really  bid red spider hanging from  my sunroof . The first thing I did was yell for my roommate  cause I am really  really afraid of spiders . so  I looked at it for a min  and  then  my roommate yell and asked what  was wrong so  I  turned to look at him . When  I looked back into the car  the spider had crawled  somewhere . so I had my roommate inspect  my car to look for the spider but had no luck finding it. I was not  going to go to church this morning cause of my fear of spiders  if I would have saw it while I was driving I would have passed out or either got into a accident so  said  I wasn't going to go . Well I thought about  it and  I  to  my self "" the devil is a lie , I am going to church "".  So I got in to my car praying  and driving at the same time scared to death . Thank God  I did make to church and did not see the spider ,  but going I was so scared  I was shaking  looking to each side , up and down and in every corner of my car looking for it .  I was  30 min late but  I did make it . It was my first time going to the church  so  I was expecting it  to be a little what I was use to . Ya know standing and singing , shouting a and dancing ,  just letting  go and letting God have his way . It wasn't what I  expected  but I enjoyed the service .  Well after church  I came home and  got undressed  and call my  mom  but  she was at church , so  I got online  and there was Sarah ,Will's girlfriend . We chatted for a min and then  she put my pic on my LJ page . THANKS SARAH. and   now here I am . I think  today  im  going to go back to church  if I can  find one to go to cause u know im new here and  don't  know anything about the town  .So if u want to u can offer any advice to me . Thanks. Well I guess this is it for now . remember to to keep our nation  in  your prayers . PRAY for PEACE , PRAY for LOVE and PRAY for UNDERSTANDING . It is in GOD  that we live . GOD BLESS YOU ."

Today is going by slow and it sucks. Luis kinda brought something up that made me think. Why is that when I move, all the things that I guess you can say I was too nervous to do with him, I wanna do now? Honestly, I dont know why...And thats whats bad. I need someone to talk to and maybe try to understand that. And I have a feeling that this is really messing up Luis too in some way. And thats not cool cus I feel like shit for it and all of that.I mean...I dunno...my feelings for him...cant put into words...They're so strong and I just love him with all my heart. This is gonna make me mad that I really dont understand WHY?....Blah...

After all the shit people talk, after all the drama we been in, after everything. We still gonna have each other and be together. Its a really weird feeling but I like that feeling. Its like, cus I know that i can prove people wrong. Like my mom, family, friends, and just people  I know who say that me and luis couldnt last and blah blah blah. Just, dunno...just to think about him makes me smile and laugh b/c i think of things we have done and just good times. WOW...almost 10 months. Sept. 4th will be 10 months. Thats a long time, but I have no problem with it. Im not complaining, lol.

"event","Thing have been so so lately. I freaking over drafted 3 times because my rent check cleared before my deposited check did. GRRR. That's $34x3. Piece of shit bank. I think I'm going to go or call down there and try to work with them. I heard that sometimes they'll be lienant. Still.. it's chomping away at my spring break money. I still have to pay my insurance: $116 and my credit card: $99. So aggrevating. At least I get paid over spring break. Not that I will get paid much since I won't be working. 

Richard has been hot and cold. One day he's all about it and the next he's not. I decided to go back into chill mode. I'm not going to call and I haven't been up to the bar since friday when he pissed me off. I might not even go out wednesday for ladies night. Friday I saw him at dirty birds. I pretty much blew him off. He introduced me to his dad and before hand i saw him giving me a special introduction before they walked over. I took that as a good thing. Afer his dad left the bar neither one of us spoke to each other until we were leaving. He was headed to the brick house and didnt even invite me. Hasnt called since either. I can't get too pissed because i act the same way but that's not the way my game is supposed to go. When i ignore him, he's supposed to pay MORE attention to me. GRRR! I talked to liz about it and she pretty much said that she thinks he acts that way just because i dont give him the attention he wants but that i flirt with other guys up there. I know he gets jealous but i dont know if it's such a good tactic to use after all. I keep telling myself to wait it out until spring break and see what happens. Now, I'm kinda nervous that I'm putting way too much on spring break and im going to end up getting let down. For the most part I have been pretty confident in thinking that something would get established in the keys... but now i dont know. I need to not think so and expect the worse so that i dont end up upset or let down. I'm going to start now:
I have no expectations of me and richard not only in key west, but ever. He's not THAT great. If something comes of it, good. If not, fine, no loss. I'm going to go on spring break to get drunk and get tan and whatever else. I'm NOT going to be the LEAST bit concerned with richard!!!! That's the main objective!!!!!

Ansley and i are living in the NICEST house next year. I can not wait. It's only years old, and it's 2 stories. The downstairs is massive with a massive kitchen and 1/2 bath. Upstairs are the 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 1 in between 2 of the rooms. The rooms are really big too. They're all the same size from what i could tell and a queen bed fits comfortably. The only thing i'm not overly happy about is the bathroom situation. I guess ansley and i will share. It's not a big deal but i've had my own bathroom forever and had my own bathroom in my room for the past 2 years. Now, ansley and i have to agree on decorations and all that and she's kinda messy with her bathroom. Not to mention she takes LOOONG showers. Oh well. I'll be in a house, big house, close to campus and even close to the stadium. It even has a garage! That of which has a beer pong table in it. Anyway, one girl that ansley knows lives there now and the other 3 are moving out so we still have to find one more roommate. I dont have any suggestions. I actually kinda dont want to know the person at all. I think I'd like it better that way. 

That's about all i feel like thinking about tonight. I need to go to bed because i plan on getting up early to lay out tomorrow. Then, I have to work, drive home at 11:30 at night, wake up early for a gyno appt and then drive home to do a take home test. It was fortunate tho that she made it a take home test so that I dont even have to study or haul ass to gville in time for class. 

I'm exhausted already thinking about it! Goodnight!

"event","Work was ok tonight. I closed with candice without a precloser. We got out on time. Emily and her lebanese b/f and his brother came in. I have a feeling this whole thing is going to be a big mistake. Oh well, i'll deal. 

I've felt really crappy about my body lately. I'm sick of having a tummy. I seriously feel/look pregnant. I hate it! I tell myself that i wont eat as much or as often but i cant do it. I love to eat. I dont even eat junk food. I love healthy things so i dont know what the problem is. I need to work out but i hate going to public gyms. I've been doing sit ups though. 

Guy situation still sucks. Jarob called me tonight while i was working and left me a voice message of him burping and then ""what are you thinking calling me at 1am? later."" He had a joking tone but i still thought he could have come up with something else to say. But it's messages like that that remind me not to call him. I miss him though, as much of an ass as he can be, i still miss talking to him. I still think about him through out the day, but not as much. It's kind of sad though. I dont like feeling blaa because of him but the thought of forgetting about him is upsetting too. I dont know what i'd do if he forgot about me! I dont want to lose contact with him. Actually, i feel like we've drifted so much already. It went from him wishing i had gone to tampa sooner, to telling me he wanted me to meet him in tampa before he left for vegas, to him asking me to go to WI, to ""i dont want a g/f"", to him not knowing if he'll be back in time for my bday, to barely even talking. UGH i hate it. 

I wouldnt mind hanging out with sean but he's ""just not that into me."" oh well. He'd be helpful in not thinking about jarob. Making time pass too. Oh well. Maybe someone new will come along one of these days. After all, i haven't had my june asshole and i'm starting july. I've had one guy a month since this time last year excluding january. Someone's bound to come along sooner or later...

I'm driving home to deland this friday. I'm looking forward to it as usual. 
I hope to get my period soon or we might have a little sean-michelle running around, god forbid.

I think im going to do some sit ups, read some harry pooter, and finally go to bed because i have to work at 12:15 tomorrow and im used to sleeping in until like 1.




EDIT: sean just beeped me speak of the devil. He was asking me what i'm doing tonight. It's 2:30 in the morning. I know it's just a booty call but i still think it's funny. He's laying in frank's yard unable to drive home so i offered to pick him up and take him home. It would give me great pleasure to make him think he's going to get some and then leave him at his house by himself. BUT, i just remembered, he still talks to his X. SHe can pick his ass up. I'm sure he's called her already. We'll see..."

I got that off of chirsta queens away message. It's perfect. Every night i dream about jarob. Most of the time my dreams just have to do with him being with me in fl for one reason or another. He's wherever i am. Then i wake up. And i feel sad for maybe a moment or maybe the rest of the day in my subconscience. :( One day my dreams will come true!!"

""Fall To Pieces""

I looked away
Then I look back at you
You try to say
The things that you can't undo
If I had my way
I'd never get over you
Today's the day
I pray that we make it through

Make it through the fall
Make it through it all

[Chorus:]
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in Love With you

You're the only one,
I'd be with till the end
When I come undone
You bring me back again
Back under the stars
Back into your arms

[Chorus]

Wanna know who you are
Wanna know where to start
I wanna know what this means

Wanna know how you feel
Wanna know what is real
I wanna know everything, everything

[Chorus without last line]

[Chorus]

I'm in love with you
Cuz i'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you"

Find you when I'm close to the bottom
You can't appreciate the time it takes
To kick a love I always knew was kind of wrong
And as I'm putting out the flame
Somebody brings up your name

Baby baby baby bring me down
I wanna be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
So you can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart

Six A.M. unruffled pillow
Laughs out loud at my trusting heart
Like I didn't see the pennies
Missed the fountain by a couple yards
If you would only stay gone 
Maybe I could move on...

Baby baby baby bring me down
I wanna be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
So you can look me in the eye and break my heart
Bring me down

And really, I'll probably just stay up really late studying because i think i'm going to go with Mel and Stacey up to chili's for 2 for 1's. I'll have to watch them drink because i have NO money! Grrr.  Oh well, i'm just glad school is almost over. I'm going to jax's friday and that'll be a nice get away. I think sean went home for a couple days.

I had to go to allan's for his bday first but then i stoppped in gator city at like 12:30. I liked that he invited me to hang out with his friends :) Then tuesday night he invited me over to watch a movie with him.(Boondock saints)&nbsp;We didn't finish it tho. Last night i went to Gator city again with&nbsp; mel and some of her friends. Sean stayed home. I saw brent. We had a nice little conversation. He didnt make me pay the cover because i ""look good naked"". i told him he better remember it because he'll never see it again. I also told him i knew he was giving my number out. He half ass&nbsp;denied it. Anyway, i had fun. Melissa and her boyfriend were trashed, i had to drive home while josh puked out the passenger window SO GROSS! When i talked to sean last night he told me to give him a beep today but i want the ball in his court so he's supposed to beep me. He hasnt yet :( But i dont care.... (riight). Ansley and i are going to cook something up for dinner tonight. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>I was talking to mel about this, i'd be really pissed if ross tried to sabotage sean and i because he's so jealous. It's so something he would do too. Brandon used to hate me too, but i hope he has enough consideration for me to not be a dick. Who knows? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>For the first weekend in a while i have to work on sat. 3:30-8. Practically the whole day! I don't know of any for sure parties yet either. I think sean might be going home for the weekend but im not sure yet. I want to hang out with him, but i kinda hope he does go&nbsp; home so that i dont have to worry about him beeping me and so on. Although, he's pretty good about it.</FONT></P>

With much attempt to not jinx myself i'll say that i am really pleased with how things are going. He makes me happy. I'm looking forward to seeing him in daytona next week. :)

I just got done packing for this week in deland. I don't know what i am going to do with miss kitty tho. My roommate is going to ask her friend to feed her for me while i'm gone. I want to be outta g-ville by 2 and i haven't heard back from the girl yet and it's 1:17. 

my feet are ice cubes!

I'm looking forward to this week. Lee's bday night is tonight. Should make for an interesting night. 

Miss kitty is snuggling with me right now. She;s laying on my stomach with her head burried in my hair and neck. Im going to miss her :(

I haven't eaten anything yet today, I'm starving. 

Goal for spring break is to find a bathing suit for the bahamas."

I bet you didnt know Elvis was still alive did you? Michael moore is trying to corrupt my lover. That idiot. 

It is officially my spring break!! GIRLS GONE WILD!!... coming soon.

My all time new favortie song: something sexy about the rain- kenny chesney. If you haven't heard it, download it. It's amazing. It makes me wanna be with a boy doing it in the rain mmmmm......

I finally vacuumed my room today. It was bad. I put new kitty litter in miss kittys box too. I refuse to have my room smell like kevin's at the condo. GROSS! Speaking of miss kitty, she needs a babysitter for a week. She's really sweet and clean. 

My spring break is going to be somewhat busy. I have my nephews b-day party and lee's b-day to celebrate on this saturday then I have my great grandfathers viewing and funeral on sunday and monday along with a dentist app on monday. Then thursday i get my hair cut FINALLY! And also thurs and friday josh will be in daytona for spring break. I want to go over there. It seems to weird that people really go to daytona for s/b. 
i think im going to take a nap. Hopefully tonight will be a late night. Although i do work tomorrow at 1130, yuck!"

"event","I just had the perfect quote for my previous entry:
""Wait for the guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, will stay awake just to watch you sleep...Wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, Who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, Who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without make up, one who is constantly reminding you how much he cares and how lucky is he to have you... the one who turns to his friends, smiles and says, ""thats her!""

That's who i am waiting for. Justin Bass was like that. :("

"event","Man o man. I JUST finished my 1000 word or so essay. It was pretty easy to write though. Especially with help from Lee. I think last night was the first Saturday night that i spent at home. But i needed to! It was kinda nice. I have to work tonight and i don't care. It's a closing shift, which mean i won't be working with marty or holly, YES! I work with Candice, who is ok i guess, and Jeremy who is fun. Not to mention i NEED THE MONEY! 

Rob called me 3 times last night and text messaged me once. I'm so over that whole thing. I don't even have to desire to hang out with him anymore. Being single really isn't that bad, you know. It will just suck when Valentines day comes. Last year i had to valentines. What goes around comes around. 

That movie with josh hartnett where he can't have sex for like 40 days or something is on. I haven't had sex in 40 days and it's not even a bet. 

Omg! I had a nightmare about the girl who gave a me a lap dance the one night, last night. We were at the bar again and she took her clothes off and tried to hook up with me. I finally started cursing her and pushed her away from me and left. It was awful! I hope i never see her again! Reminder, it was a dream. Didn't really happen thank god. 

My mom told me yesterday that my stepdad has something wrong wit his bladder. It could be a number of things. One on the list being a tummor. I might go to hell for saying this... no i can't say it. But I think he needs to think he's having a near death experience, over come it and become a nice person. I don't want him to die obviously, i wouldn't wish that on anyone, but if he did, i would be sad for my mom. Or maybe happy for my mom. I mean she would be devestated at the least, but she deserves so much better. Ugh i hate him. What goes around comes around... that's all i have to say, so if it means him dying from cance in his bladder... well he should have treated people better and not been such as asshole. I really am bitter towards him. I should pray for him, but i have so much resentment i won't mean it. If i pray for him it will be with my mom's best interest in mind.

My tootsies are chilly. I'm hungry too, i think ill make some oodle of noodles, mm mm mmm delicioso!"

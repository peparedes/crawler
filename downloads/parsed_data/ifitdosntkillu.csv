Tweezers

    * To see tweezers in a dream, denotes uncomfortable situations will fill you with discontent, and your companions will abuse you.


Kidnapper

To dream that you are being kidnapped, denotes feelings of being trapped and restricted. Someone or some situation may be diverting your  concentration and your attention away from your goals.

PAPER CLIP

To see or use a paper clip in your dream, suggests that you feel that you need to hold a relationship together. Perhaps you need to organize certain aspects of your life. 

Singing

To hear singing in your dreams, betokens a cheerful spirit and happy companions. You are soon to have promising news from the absent.

"event","Ok, now's the time to test your Internet-fu, people...

First, a little history. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Middle East was pretty much run by the British.. the sun never sets on the Empire and all that. That presence waned significantly after the First World War. The British presence, however, had lasting effects, both politically and culturally. One such remnant is some of the military practices (ceremonial). In particular, bagpipes.

Not some Middle Eastern bagpipe (there are locally-developed bagpipes of all sorts all over the world) that's native to the region, but *Highland* bagpipes. Highland bagpipes in an *Arab* military setting. Highland bagpipes playing *Arab* music. It's unlike anything you've ever heard before.

The one and only time I encountered this music was on CNN, during the live coverage of the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan a few years back. There was a pipe band as part of the procession to the grave site. It was definitely slower, processional music appropriate for a king's funeral, but it was still faster and much different than what you would hear in the west.

I'm not thinking of specifically getting a recording of the music I heard, but rather that genre - Arab/Middle Eastern music played on bagpipes.

So who knows that I'm talking about?"

"event","I am absolutely fascinated by the loss of meaning of the word ""passion"". Of course Karl would argue that 
I make up my own meanings of words...nonetheless, the etymology derives from ""passio"", referring to the suffering of Christ on the cross, and later to the suffering of martyrs in general. A sampling of the current definition (dictionary.com) is:

1. any powerful or compelling emotion or feeling, as love or hate
3. strong sexual desire; lust
9. violent anger .

My own sense of the word is ""a feeling, belief or emotion so deeply felt as to leave one at the mercy of one's acts"". ""Compelling"" is a milkwater word in comparison. The New Testament is not a work concerning a man who found humanity merely ""compelling"" -- he spoke out and acted against his society's treatment of the ill, poor and abused, knowing that he would be horribly, painfully executed for it.

I wonder how many people recognize passion today?"

"event","I just finished reading Douglas Adams' Last Chance to See online, a book he wrote about his travels with a zoologist for a BBC radio program on endangered species in the mid-1980s. It's a fascinating collection of vignettes narrated in traditionally wonderful Adams' style; it's largely very painful to look at the updated information though. He describes going to China to see the conservation efforts that were, at the time, just starting for the baiji (river dolphin), now presumed extinct. There are a few stories, such as that of the kakapo, which show a little improvement -- in the 80s, there were 45 living birds, and now there are 95. Still, though, the numbers are heartbreaking. It's terribly frustrating to see how long intelligent people have been pointing at the warning signs for global warming, extinctions, etc. with no appreciable changes enacted in the years since. Ever since I was extremely young, I've been aware of the clock ticking on this subject... it makes me bitterly regret not being influential or rich enough to really DO Something on a grand scale."

From the pitch it sounded like a woman, a little scratchy-voiced, and from the accent, it was a lower-class person either african american or white (redneck or black). Freaky. Apropos of nothing. From an ""unknown number"" on my phone.

I saw that slogan on a bumper sticker. Google reveals it showing up peppered around the internet, sometimes in what seems like unlikely or meaningless places. Makes me think it's some kind of dog whistle slogan. Like a fnord. I dunno why someone would call me, say a cryptic message into my phone, and then hang up."

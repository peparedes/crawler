"event","Wow, so ya, it has been a while ay?  Im sure everyone was just at complete suspense about my life, and that's why I thought it was time to update. So lets see...I started working at the new bk.  I like the people there a lot more, they are much more enjoyable to be around.  However, I do still wish I could work with some of the people I left at the other bk.  As for the customers...they are the same no matter what store you work at. Idiots.  In ways, they are probably even bigger idiots then before.  Why? Because they are all rich bastards.  It's funny, you wouldn't think that rich old bastards would think they were better than a teenaged worker at burger king lol.
Last tuesday, I proudly voted for the first time with my mom.  It was her first time too.  I made everyone  get out to vote because I feel very very strongly towards doing so.  I think it's completely ridiculous to hear that people don't go out to vote. ""wah, wah, my vote doesn't matter"" ""wah wah, I think both guys are idiots"" ""wah, wah, it doesn't effect me"".  No matter what the reason, you such people are ignorant.  I know it sounds corny, but really, people worked very hard to get the rights for certain people to vote, and then people feel its not a necessity to vote..oh how they are wrong.
...oh there is more.
I am very pleased that George Bush was in fact re-elected.  People have said im stupid, dumb, and ignorant for voting that way, and that bugs me.  Don't we have the right to choose?  And that is really funny when said to me because this election I was VERY educated in.  I was watching, and following this race for a year and came up with my decision on a reasonable standard.  No matter who you vote for, as long as you can honestly say that you have made an educated decesion then you did a good thing.
So that leads to the people that are so anti-Bush that they jokingly say, or actually do want to leave the country.  how ridiculous are you.  This is the best country that anyone can offer.  Even if the WORST president came into office, we would be better off than any other country. Move to canada? If you really want to, I will personally drive you there if you feel that way.  Go ahead, move to a horrible economy, messed up court systems, and really, just a mess of a country...Im sure you will be much more happier there.

Ok, im done.  I think my point has been made."

"event","I guess it's time to update this stupid thing even though I still don't think many people read it, because nobody ever leaves comments! you can leave a comment about anything, I don't care!  Whelp, although I'm still sadly working at burger king, I have decided to go to another store.  They are giving me more money and more hours, so I thought I should take it because I was getting so frustrated at where I'm at now...so in my line of thinking, Im hoping that moving stores will be a change of scenery for me and therefor kind of a new breath.  So starting next monday, Ill be working at 15 and telegraph.  It takes about ten minutes longer to get there.  Wednesday and thursday are my last days at the dump I'm at now...I won't miss too many of the people although there will be some that I wish I could bring with me.
I have been so tired lately, Im not sure why, but its driving me nuts.  I dont think it has anything to do with staying up late, because I always do that.  I have been in a really good mood lately though, I know why...nobody else does though. ha.  Hopefully this mood is around for a while.
I'm going up to state again this weekend, Im beggining to wonder if I already live there cause im there so much.  Going to a birthday party, should be fun because some really cool people will be there! ;)
I think thats about it for now, um...ya...leave the comments!"

"event","Hey all, been a while I guess...tough.  The other day, for whatever reason, I bought two books.  This is quite a feat for me seeing as I normally hate reading.  But these elections have gotten me so into politics that I wanted to learn more about current issues and such.  Bought two books by Bill O'Reilly, if you haven't heard of him, he's pretty funny and tells things how they are.  That might be why I really enjoy it because thats how I think I am.  Funny and tell you exactly what I think.  I don't like it when people beat around the bush or don't say what they feel because they don't want to offend anyone...I can't be like that lol.  

Tomorrow after school I'm probably going to go up to state for the night and then watch football with mike on sautrday.  Friday night I have to go get coldstone ice cream...the whole reason why I'm coming up right!? then saturday night ill be back at home cause i have hockey, then sunday I believe i'm going to the lions/packers game..should make for a great weekend.  

Today I decided to skip my bio lecture because I wasn't really in the mood to go and we just had a test that I did well on so I think i deserve the day off. Then I have the pleasure of working at 4 today.  It's beginning to get ridiculous at burger king...we are getting busier and busier.  Remember the days when families would have a nice night in their homes with a home cooked meal on the table?  It's hard to believe that there was a day when fast food did not exist.  I don't have problems with people coming in once in a while and getting some food...but it is a problem when the same people come in day after day and sometimes even more than once a day.  I really wish I had the power and right to look at them and ask them what the hell they are doing.  BURGER KING IS NASTY PEOPLE. lol..

Ok, I have complained enough...you all have a good weekend as im sure I will...leave some comments for me!"

"event","I'm in a horrible mood tonight.  Work is just a joke.  Anyone that says they hate their job should seriously reconsider the possibilities of what you could be doing.  Burger King is an absolute joke.  The people that come through their are rude, asses, and just plain stupid.  It makes me miserable working there.  Tonight work was very bad and to top it off I get a black lady that accuses me of hating blacks and that I am in the wrong business if I hate blacks.  and the kicker of it is, i honestly have NO idea what I did.  I handed her her drink and she through out the race card...no idea....I hope that a black women will read this journal entry and think about something that i'm about to say.  It's been close to 50 years since  blacks have had the same rights as everyone, and perhaps now they are even treated better in some ways because we feel bad for what happend in the past and now we make up for it.  I'm sorry that there was a time where that was not the case, and that DOES NOT mean that the world still hates you.  Im tired of everything being about race, religion, and gender.  For God sakes, just live your damn life with no grudges against EVERYTHING.  If anyone has a problem with what im saying...tough.

To top off my night, I find out my dad is going to the UofM football game on saturday, and i dont get to go.  I have been DYING to go all year and he doesnt even give a shit, but he gets to go.  not fair.

at least tomorrow night should be fun...going to the homecoming game with ann and sarah and going to get some ice cream!

Go Bush."

"event","Went to the dave matthews concert...it was AMAZING.  He sounds incredible live, I was very impressed.  The only downer of the concert was that they had some old dude named Neil Young come out and play for what ended up being an hour.  I have never heard of the guy, but evidently everyone else there has because they went nuts.  The fact that he played wasn't so bad, but when he played with dmb, they didnt play dmb songs.  DMB only ended up playing about nine of their own songs which was very dissapointing considering they didnt play some of their best ones.  But the ones they did play were very very cool

Went to dairy queen the other day too...they have a new pumpkin pie blizzard, I think I wet my pants...twice. They combined two of my favorite things, ice cream and pumpkin pie, how could I not fall in love?

That is about it, nothing new and exciting in my life as usual.  Hmm..ok"

"event","Hey all, how's it going? Once again I know nobody reads this, but I guess it feels good to write my thoughts down if not for you guys, for me.  Nothing much has changed since I last wrote.  Except that i got an ipod!!! How freakin sweet it is too.  Im going to get a transmitter that allows you to play the ipod through your car radio...neato...

Tonight I talked to someone that I would still consider myself to be close with. It was a good talk, but it triggered my thought process.  It made me wonder even more what I want in my life, and if ill ever have what I have always dreamed of having.  We are both kind of on the same boat.  I would think its safe to say that i am different then most guys. better or worse? I dont really know...I like to think that its for the better.  But I just wish that everything I wanted and everyway i wanted something to be, could just be on a switch on my wall that I could just turn on.  There are probably only a few people that actually understand me.  And I guess only one person that actually understands what I'm talking about right now.  I have tried for the better part of my life to be different then most people because I like how I am rather then how the oppisite is, but it kinda seems like you dont fit in if thats how you are.  I dunno, just some weird thoughts tonight.  and the person that is on the same boat as me, you know who you are, I can always use your help talking about this stuff, because you understand, and I thank you for that.

Ok, enough rambling.  Hockey starts saturday, and im soooo excited.  I miss playing, its been half a year! 

Today's dumbass of the day does not go out to a customer, it goes out to one of our managers MARY THE BITCH!!! I have never really been able to say I hate someone, but I think its a safe bet with this women.  She is the devil, it must be true.  She just really pissed me off tonight, thats why she is the dumb ass.  

Ok, night all, how bout we leave some messages for me?"

"event","Yo all...Had an awesome weekend so far.  Went up to state friday night and hung out with mike, good times for sure.  Then we met up with the hippest next door neighbors in the world and partied at the house.  also good times.  Met some new people, definitely thought they were cool.  Excited to go there next year ;).  I was going to stay all weekend, and i wish i could have, but today was my sisters birthday so I came home earlier to celebrate it with my family.  We all had dinner and the usuall stuff, it was fun as well.  Little kayla and even smaller tyler were so cute tonight.  They were a lot of fun to play with, as they always are.  This weekend kinda made me curious about some things...we'll have to see how that works out for me.  But ya, I'm going to go watch the football game that I recorded...how about we leave adam lots of messages!?!? okie dokie, night all"

"event","Well, well, well...I sunk down and did it again, I updated.  I kinda gave up on the whole livejournal game because I don't think anyone truely cares to know what's going on in my life.  Im not sure I really care either, cause nothing is going on.  School isn't too bad, work sucks, story of my life.  I have been really into music lately.  Downloading everything I like and getting to the point where I have too many songs on my computer for my own good.  I want these new computer speakers because they sound amazing, but they are what you could say...""a shit load of money"" but I asked for em for christmas, so i will probably get them lol.

Im leaving to go up to MSU again tomorrow (my future home believe it or not).  Im really excited about next year with that and staying in a AWESOME apartment.  So, I'm going up to visit some friends tomorrow, I like going up there and kinda feeling what it will be like next year...not to mention I need to have some fun.  Haven't been having that much fun lately.  Im at the point in my life where im trying to figure a lot of shit out.  I don't know what I want.  Not sure I know how to explain it.  As soon as I think im happy, something seems to always slap me in the face.  I just want to always be happy and I need something that will do that for me. ah well.

So lets see if I can get back to the routine of the DUMB ASS OF THE DAY.  This time it's not at BK.  A lady crashed into JCpenny at oakland mall in attempt to commit suicide.  Did she succeed? NOPE. Why you ask?  CAUSE THE STUPID LADY WAS WEARING HER SEATBELT.  So instead of suicide, she will now be spending some years in jail...moron

Ok, im done for now, im sure thats more than anyone can handle as is...Ill update later"

"event","This weekend was very good.  I was originally going to go to my brothers house in holland for just sunday and monday but since i didn't have much to do before then i came up with the idea of driving myself there friday after work.  It was fun to hang out with them.  Lots of good food so it was easy to please me.  It rained a lot though, but oh well.

My friends are all telling me to get an earing on the top of my ear.  Im leaning towards trying it just to see what it looks like, and I can always take it out if i don't like it, right?  Lets get a poll going on who thinks i should/shouldn't get one.  it will probably be three people that comment on this poll, but i still want comments! lol

Today, sunday, i came home and just relaxed.  I was tired.  Speakin of, im still tired so im going to go lay down.  work in the morning :(

a lady orders a large diet coke.  Once she places her order she says, EXCUSE ME!? and i reply YES!? Lady..""What is the difference between the large pops and the king cups? and i reply...""one is bigger mam"" the lady replies ""oh ok, thanks!"" umm..DUH

Do you want cheese or bacon on your sandwhich? ""Is it extra!?"" well come on, of course it is extra, if it came on the sandwhich already, why would I ask if you wantved it on it!? Do I ask if you want lettuce on your whopper? Or pickle on your cheeseburger? NO i dont. So use your heads please.

So today, worked sucked.  It always sucks.  That's why its fast food.  Because stupid people who have nothing better to do come in and get everything on the menu.  I think much of what I say on this journal will be about stupid customers.  For example.  A double whopper with no meat.  Someone ordered that.  Why not just order a whopper no meat?  You could order a million whopper no meat AND IT'S STILL THE SAME THING!!!!

Well Im pumped cause I am going to game seven tonight..go pistons!!! ciao

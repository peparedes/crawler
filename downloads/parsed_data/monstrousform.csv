"event","A word about Julian Tavarez.

For non-Red Sox fans, Julian Tavarez is Boston's 5th starter this year. He's done pretty well for a 5th starter - his stats and incidentals are right around league average, but he's been consistent and has occasionally come off pretty well in games where he's matched against the other team's ace.

However, he is quickly gaining a cult following in Red Sox Nation because he is absolutely hilarious to watch, primarily because he seems to be just a <i>teensy</i> bit crazy. Some examples:

-He has, on several occasions, <i>rolled</i> the baseball to first base to make an out.
-On double play balls he flails his arms at the infielders like a spastic traffic cop, waving first at second and then spinning wildly to point at first.
-He's been spotted wearing shoes with David Ortiz's face on them.
-Earlier in the season he was apparently trying to give Daisuke some pitching tips, a feat somewhat comparable to Dustin Pedroia trying to give Ortiz batting tips.
-During one game, Manny spent at least 2 or 3 minutes rubbing JT's head in the dugout, on camera, for no discernable reason. That might be more Manny's crazy than JT's, but still.

And then, tonight, I got to see him <i>bat</i>. And oh my, was it glorious. He stood in the box like a hyperactive rabbit. The bat swung about like it was on the end of a jack-in-the-box. At one point he appeared to swing <i>backwards</i>, the bat extending behind him in a one-handed grip. During one pitch he showed bunt and retracted it at least three times. Oh yeah, he bats lefty, too, despite being a right handed pitcher.

There's just so much to love about this year's team."

"event","If you're a baseball fan, you may have noticed that Mariano Rivera kinda sucks this year. Well, maybe that's not totally fair. After a decade of utterly dominant relief work for the Yankees, any slippage looks enormous in comparison. Still, his numbers thus far are pretty awful for any bullpen scrub, let alone someone who has in the past been the league's most reliable closer. And, as a baseball nerd, I have a theory as to why.

Rivera has always lived by the strength of his cut fastball. This is a pitch that comes in about belly-button high at 95+ MPH and takes a sharp left turn just as it crosses the plate. It <i>just</i> dips away from right-handers, and jams in on the hands of left-handers. And that's pretty much what he throws, all the time. 

Except there was a little article back during spring training that talked about how Rivera was starting to experiment with adding a change-up to his arsenal. I didn't think much about it at the time but maybe that was a warning sign. Why would you want to mix it up if your best pitch is unhittable anyway? Well, maybe because it's not quite as sharp as it used to be?

And, lest we forget, that cut fastball isn't <i>always</i> unhittable. The Red Sox, especially in recent years, have been able to get to Mo's cutter with some regularity. Not coincidently, they've seen him more than any other team. And Rivera's been around for quite a while - maybe other teams have finally had enough eyefuls of the demon pitch that they're starting to learn how to hit it. Combine that with his aging arm, and maybe you've got a recipe for a cutter that just doesn't cut it anymore."

Mets in 4. I think the Mets are the most all-around solid team heading into the playoffs. They'll drop one due to some crazy heroics out of the Dodgers, but it won't be enough.

Twins in 4. I'm gonna predict Radke drops game 2, for no particular reason, but otherwise the Twins don't sweat much.

Then I read <i>The Plot Against America</i> by Philip Roth. This got rave reviews, which I'm not sure are entirely deserved. I suspect the reviews were heavily influenced by the fact that, hey, it's Philip Roth. It is quite a good alternate-history novel, but it never quite seems to be able to decide if it's telling the close-up story of a family dealing with events beyond their control that threaten their way of life or if it's telling the larger story of an America gone off-track. It also ends with a big expository lump and a very unsatisfying ending.

I didn't quite finish it by the end of May, but I did just finish <i>Rabbit, Run</i> by John Updike. Generally hailed as one of those modern American classics you keep hearing about, this is the first in a series of four novels (though I don't believe Updike originally conceived of writing a series) chronicling the life of Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom. The first is set in 1959, when Rabbit is 26, married, and feeling trapped. As the title indicates, he runs, causing horrendous damage to the lives of the people around him. Rabbit isn't a sympathetic character, and there really isn't a redemption for him in the book, yet he's likeable anyway. As for Updike, his style doesn't seem particularly original or daring, but he definitely constructs his prose very well. I'll give <i>Rabbit Redux</i> a shot one of these days.

Now I'm reading <i>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</i>. It's, uh, not for the squeamish. It is, however, interesting and morbidly funny."

I did ok. Hit a single my first time up and got driven in later for a run, but didn't reach base again. I think I was 1 for 4. I made pretty good contact the rest of my at-bats, but Yale had a crazy good infield, so I couldn't run them out for hits. I played right field for about 2 innings too, only had a playable ball hit to me once, and embarassingly missed it. Oh well. I think I might do better at infield - I'm better at knocking a ground ball down than catching a fly ball.

It's very good even though it really is just a visually expanded and enhanced version of the presentation Gore's been giving for years, with some additional commentary and background on how he personally came to feel so strongly about global warming.

It's really remarkably entertaining, and moves quite quickly. Almost too quickly at times - it's got 100 minutes to get through a LOT of detail, and Gore often moves right on to the next point in his presentation before you've really had a chance to absorb the last one.

The scientific quibbles talked about here: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/05/al-gores-movie/ are definitely there, but they're not presented as ""this is the absolute scientific truth of the situation."" Instead they're presented as a simplified abstraction to make the ideas easier for an audienct to grasp. Gore's not presenting a research paper, he's trying to educate complete neophytes.

He's very personable while doing it too. He clearly was another sufferer of the dreaded loss-of-personality disease that affects so many political campaigners. Sigh.

Anyway, go see it as soon as possible.

""The government fails to appreciate the fact that its founding document, its mission statement and charter, places freedom and privacy above such concerns as safety. Each and every Amendment to the Constitution contained in the Bill of Rights states limits on the government with the full understanding that these limits will ultimately get innocent people killed. The First Amendments will cause riots and religious infighting. The Second Amendment guarantees that children will be accidentally shot to death in their homes, and intentionally shot to death at their schools. The Third Amendment prevents soldiers from requisitioning the food and shelter they need to win battles on American Territory from so doing, simply because the owner refuses. The Fourth Amendment means that dangerous chemicals and drugs will pass from city to city, where they will be sold to dangerous people, furthermore, if those drugs are discovered, the drug mule does not have to say where the drugs were going or where they've been! The Fifth Amendment makes sure that child molestors, rapists, drug pushers, armed robbers, murderers, klansmen, and tax evaders have professional assistance to manipulate the system and get them back on the street if at all possible, regardless of their guilt, and the level of danger they pose to society.

The list goes on, and it includes such gems as not trying a killer a second time, even if we find more evidence to prove his guilt, not placing too high of bail for criminals, and forcing the government to help get defense witnesses to show up at trials.

The fact of the matter is, the Founding Fathers would prefer that people die in the occasional terrorist plot, or gun accident, or robbery to the alternative. It's not a pleasant thought, that people will have to die as a result of our freedoms being used by criminal elements and idiots, but at the end of the day, the freedom of some stranger to speak their mind against the government is worth more to our fellow Americans than even our own lives."""

The North, led by the abolitionists, wanted to free the slaves, while the South, led by the aristocratic plantation owners, wanted to keep them. You may be told that this is a bit of an oversimplification, but fuck it, you've got centuries of American history to learn and only a few semesters to learn it in.

Later, if you happen to revisit the subject in high school or college, you may learn that the Civil War really grew out of conflicts like economic disparity between the North and the South brought about industrialization, growth of the American middle class, changing population dynamics brought about by immigration and urbanization, etc. Abolitionism/Slavery was certainly among those causes, of course.

If you continue to study the Civil War, you learn that, really, all of those conflicts were because of slavery.

"event","Sort of a schizophrenic month as far as my reading went:

<lj-cut text=""Many books under the cut.""><i>The Devil in the White City</i> by Erik Larson. Non-fiction account of the men behind the building of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and a serial killer who was active in Chicago at the same time. Really good, very readable, but the split personality of the book is a little strange. The two main subjects of the book, Daniel Burnham, the Fair's director and chief architect, and H.H. Holmes, the aforementioned murderer, don't have any particular link between them other than being active at the same time and place. The chapters tend to switch back and forth between the two, making the book feel like it's two books sort of spliced together. Still, both stories are interesting, and Larson keeps what could be a very dry subject interesting through the strength of his writing, so it gets a thumbs up from me.

Then I started to read <i>The Proud Tower</i> by Barbara Tuchman, which is about the quarter-century before WWI, but then baseball fever hit and I set it aside for:

<i>Mind Game</i> by ""The Baseball Prospectus Team of Experts."" I guess we won't expect any false modesty on the part of the authors. Ostensibly a recap of the 2004 Red Sox season with BP's characteristic statistical analysis, it aims a little bit higher than that, by attempting to use that season to show how the Red Sox won by rejecting a lot of baseball dogma in favor of BP's preferred sabermetric thinking. I'd say it halfway succeeds. It's obviously very pro-Red Sox, so it tends to downplay the failings of the team during that season, and emphasize the strengths. I enjoyed the book, though I have some issues with some of the analysis, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but serious baseball fans who aren't afraid of a little statistical tinkering.

Then, as a counterpoint, I read <i>Three Nights in August</i>, by Buzz Bissinger. This is mostly an ""inside-the-head"" book about Tony LaRussa, current manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, and follows his moves and thinkings during a three-game series against the Cubs in 2003. This is a counterpoint because there is very little love lost between sabermetric analysts like Baseball Prospectus and the ""classic"" baseball strategists like LaRussa. To stereotype a bit, the latter see the former as arrogant upstarts who let math and computer analysis suck the soul out of the game and have no idea how to deal with players, and the former see the latter as outmoded old-boys-club dinosaurs clinging to strategies and procedures that have been proven ineffective simply because that's how things have always been done. To be fair, the people who actually make their livings off the game are probably a lot less strident about this conflict than the fans. Bissinger is firmly in LaRussa's camp, and takes the opportunity provided by this book to glorify the role of the old school in baseball, while making a few digs at the new. The book gives a nice ""from the dugout"" view of the three games, and takes the time to explore the backstory of not only LaRussa, but also the many players highlighted by the back-and-forth of the games themselves. In the end, though, I'm not sure why Bissinger chose this particular three-game series to highlight the role of a manager, since it seemed like any time Bissinger would talk about a decision LaRussa had to make in the game, it would inevitably come up with a negative result. Bissinger shows LaRussa agonizing over whether to move the infield in, explores his decision making, and watches as the infielders move to the edge of the grass. Bloop single. Bissinger explains LaRussa's controversial love for the hit-and-run, and watches as LaRussa calls for it when the ""ideal"" situation for the play arises in the game. Double play. I have no doubt that LaRussa is a tremendous manager, but it seems like this book doesn't do a good job of highlighting him at his best.

My thirst for baseball momentarily slaked, I moved on to reading some classics I never had the time for. <i>Mother Night</i> and <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut. I'd only ever read <i>Cat's Cradle</i> (and <i>Man Without a Country</i>, but that's a little different) by Vonnegut, which I enjoyed thoroughly, and I can hardly maintain my hip intellectual street cred without having a few more Vonnegut titles under my belt. So I blazed through these two in a grand total of four days. That's one of the nice things about Vonnegut, he's a very fast read. <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i> I guess pretty much everyone knows. How I avoided reading in it high school I'm not sure. For such a short book with such simple prose, it really has a wealth of depth and meaning. The difficulty Vonnegut must have had in remembering and writing about Dresden is so wonderfully symbolized in Pilgrim's situation. I almost said ""Pilgrim's plight"" there, except Vonnegut indicates that Billy's confusion of time and memory is perhaps not really a bad thing. <i>Mother Night</i> is also about World War II, this time the post-war ""confessions"" of Howard W. Campbell. Jr., American Nazi propagandist, facing trial for war crimes in Israel. He was also an American spy, using his radio broadcasts to transmit messages to the Allies. A less layered book than S5, its message is also much simpler, and indeed given by Vonnegut in his introduction: ""We are what we pretend to be."" I can't really put it better than that.

Pretty good month, all told. Working through more Vonnegut at the moment - I snagged a big omnibus volume of six of his novels from the library.</lj-cut>"

"event","The game on Tuesday night was good, a real nail-biter. Pretty cold in the grandstand, but not unbearable.

So, lemme talk about Jonathan Papelbon.

In his handful of outings as the heir-apparent to the closer spot, he's looked really good. He's still got a perfect ERA, and there have been a good proportion of 1-2-3 innings for him, with an average of at least 1 strikeout for each of the 8 innings he's pitched, and only 2 walks.

But here's the thing - both of those walks came in that Tuesday night game, and he was clearly struggling against some of the better bats in the Tampa Bay lineup. My concern is over how much of his success thus far has been because he's a relative unknown to hitters - there's not a lot of tape of him they can analyze to figure out his pitches. It remains to be seen whether he'll continue to dominate when batters have him a bit more figured out. Hopefully he will, he's certainly got the stuff, but getting your rhythm thrown off by a batter can be pretty difficult for young pitchers, as I think Papelbon demonstrated Tuesday night."

So, yeah, I've been going nuts.

"event","Books I read in March were: 

<i>World of Wonders</i> by Robertson Davies. This is the third in the Deptford trilogy, and while it was much better than <i>The Manticore</i> it wasn't as good as <i>Fifth Business</i>. I enjoyed the trilogy, but I couldn't help but feel like the second two books didn't really add much to the framework created by Fifth Business. World of Wonders was better in that the life of Paul Dempster was drastically removed from the events of the first two books, but that does raise the question of how much his story really connects with the stories of Ramsay and David. All three were certainly good reads, but I just feel like the second two books represent more missed opportunity than anything else.

<i>What Do You Care What Other People Think?</i> by Richard Feynman. This is ostensibly the sequel to <i>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</i> but as neither is presenting a real narrative, ""sequel"" isn't really the right term. It's another collection of Feynman's anecdotes, including a lengthy section about his work on the commission investigating the Challenger shuttle disaster. The stories, as a whole, are much less amusing than those in the first book, but the section on the Challenger commission is worth the price of admission.

<i>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</i> by David Sedaris. Not as good as <i>Me Talk Pretty One Day.</i> Like the Feynman book above, this collection of Sedaris's stories is somewhat darker and more serious than the previous one. Enjoyable, but not a whole lot of laughs.

<i>Persepolis 1 & 2</i> by Marjane Satrapi. These two graphic novels are the memoirs of Ms. Satrapi's childhood and adolescence as a native born Iranian during the Islamic Revolution and consequent theocracy. They give an excellent view of what life is like for the average middle class Iranian family, and are a cautionary tale about how democracies can become despotic theocracies in the blink of an eye.

Hip deep in <i>Devil in the White City</i> at the moment, which I'm enjoying a lot."

"event","So, in February I finished <i>Fifth Business</i> and <i>The Manticore</i>, the first two books in Robertson Davies' <i>Deptford Trilogy</i>, and I'm midway through the third, <i>World of Wonders</i>. The trilogy centers around three men: Dunstan Ramsay, Boy Staunton, and Paul Dempster, all born in the little Canadian town of Deptford, who are connected by a childhood act of violence - a thrown snowball with a rock in it. The first book is narrated by Ramsay, the second by Staunton's son David, and the third by Ramsay again, though really it's narrated by Dempster at one remove, since it's Ramsay's record of Paul's oral history of his life. Each book recounts the life story of its narrator while also focusing on the life of Boy Staunton, whose eventual homicide is the bookend event to the snowball.

I don't want to say too much about the first two until I've finished the third, but I liked <i>Fifth Business</i> quite a lot, but was dissapointed by <i>The Manticore</i>. In large part I felt the second was just coasting on the foundation laid by the first book, and then it just sort of ended. It didn't really seem to explore any new territory in the tale of the Deptford folk and Boy Staunton. The third is shaping up better, but more when I finish it.

I set aside <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> to read the trilogy. I was about 2/3rds in, and it was starting to bog down. Maybe I'll pick it up again sometime later."

To understand the absurdity of this act, the reader should know that this is a game originally released when I was not yet in middle school, in 1988, and which debuted on the venerable Apple II computer. The superior IBM PC port appeared shortly thereafter.

I'm not sure what exactly prompted me to <i>start</i> playing it, but once I did I was totally hooked. I'd played a vastly inferior NES port way back in the day, and I <i>think</i> I even finished it, but all sources indicate that the NES version was a horrible, castrated, mutant bastard child, and not worth mentioning in the same sentence as the original. So playing the DOS version was fresh and new.

But, yeah, I was pretty amazed at how well the game stands up, and how it's got some ideas that current computer RPGs <i>still</i> don't always get right, if they attempt them at all. Examples: NPCs with full, logical schedules throughout the entire day/night cycle, villains that <i>actively</i> try to hinder and/or stop you in your quest, serious shades-of-gray morality choices, a magic system that really feels mysterious, a huge world with lots of meaningful exploration to do, and some really well-designed set-piece battles. It's a HARD game, too. I'm not sure a modern-day RPG could get away with being this hard, though it's never frustrating - death is only a setback, not an end.

<i>How to Read and Why</i> by Harold Bloom
<i>David Copperfield</i> by Dickens
<i>The Demon-Haunted World</i> by Carl Sagan
<i>Invisible Cities</i> by Italo Calvino

<lj-cut text=""Details..."">The first was interesting. It's basically a 3-credit literary criticism course packed into 300 pages, taught by an extremely intelligent and engaging professor with whom I vehemently disagree on a lot of things.

The second doesn't need an introduction, I suspect. I actually <i>started</i> it around the start of 2005, but took a 9 month hiatus or so after getting a third of the way through. I read the bulk of it in the past month and a half. I think Dickens requires a slightly different mindset than modern readers are used to - a sort of disregard for movement and resolution of the plot in favor of an appreciation for well drawn characters and situations - and that, once in that mindset, he can be a lot of fun to read.

The third mostly just depressed me, because since it was written the social problems with science, education and critical thinking which Sagan identifies and discusses have just gotten worse.

The fourth is strange. It's pretty much entirely plotless. The frame of the book is an ongoing discussion between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, in which Polo describes a vast number of (fictional) cities he has visited, all of which have some sort of guiding theme. The bulk of the book is said descriptions of cities. It all feels very Borges-like, but none of it really grabbed me the way Borges does, and I couldn't really pick out an overriding theme or moral from the book, if there even was one. It is, however, very short, so it's probably still worth the time, if it sounds interesting to anyone.

Now I'm working on:

<i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i> by Thomas Hardy
<i>What do you Care what Other People Think?</i> by Richard Feynman
<i>Education of a Coach</i> by David Halberstam

Yes, I read multiple books at a time. ADD, doncha' know. I usually find one of them grabs me significantly and then I focus on that one til I'm done, but I haven't yet reached that tipping point.

And on deck I've got:

<i>The Proud Tower</i> by Barbara Tuchman
<i>A Distant Mirror</i> by Barbara Tuchman
<i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> by Thomas Pynchon <-already about a quarter through this one, but had to set it aside.
<i>Light in August</i> by William Faulkner

So I've got my work cut out for me.</lj-cut>

http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ga&article_code=1172

The brief summary is that a GLBT-friendly guild was recruiting for members and stating openly that it was a GLBT-friendly guild. Blizzard shut them down, citing its sexual harassment policy. When the guild questioned this decision, as their recruitment was not insulting or inflammatory, Blizzard responded by saying that they were shutting the guild down because Blizzard believed their guild would prompt abuse and harassment.

So, basically they shut down a guild of potential <i>victims</i> of harassment because they're worried they might get harassed.

Now, I understand Blizzard wanting to keep inflammatory real-world topics out of WoW. But given the existence of guilds based around other real-world political/social/religious groups, this is a complete double standard.

I find this extremely bothersome. I know it's just a game, and WoW is probably not the place to champion social change, but this feels like the equivalent of a restaurant owner saying to an openly gay couple ""Now, I don't have any problem with you, but some of my customers might, and I don't want any trouble in my joint. So I think it's probably best if you don't come in here at all.""

As a kid, I was a big fan of the now discontinued Carnation Breakfast Bars. They were these chocolate coated bricks of what I guess was crisped rice, oats, nuts, or something. They were very tasty. I've been wondering whether any of these energy bars are anything like that.

All in all I liked it, but wasn't blown away. <i>Falcon</i> seems to get compared to <i>Casablanca</i> quite a lot but other than sharing several cast members I'm not really sure where that comparison comes from. I'm sure this film was a real sensation when it was released for it's dark noir theme but nowadays it feels pretty tame. The visual subtext of Spade's misogyny was interesting: I liked how every time he kissed a woman it looked like he was strangling her. Overall, though, meh.

...read <i>The Demon-Haunted World.</i> Started to read, really. I felt like I needed a dose of rationality to combat my aggravation at the assaults by social conservatives and religious fundamentalists on what is nowadays distressingly termed the ""reality-based"" community. As I've never read this, though I've read the excerpted ""Baloney Detection Kit"" frequently, I figured it'd probably do the trick. Not too far in yet, but I find the goal of the book to be incredibly admirable.

...played <i>Dragon Quest VIII.</i> I'm admittedly a complete fanboy for the DQ series, but this one is really incredible. I've long been of the opinion that a game with solid art direction and average graphical technology will always look better than the reverse, all else being equal. Witness World of Warcraft v. Everquest 2 for an excellent example. The DQ games have always been about art direction over graphical fortitude, but in DQ VIII the developers have created an incredibly seamless fusion of both. The game uses cel-shading to produce that now-familiar ""hand-drawn"" look, but it's backed up by the designs of Akira Toriyama (of Dragonball fame) so that every character and monster really does look hand-animated. There have been points in the game where I had to blink at the screen a bit, because it was very difficult to believe that I was looking at 3d, computer animated models rather than a scene from an anime. 

The gameplay remains the same tried-and-true, simple yet deep system of the previous DQ games, with a fair number of (mostly-cosmetic) upgrades. Gone are the simple text-box menus, replaced by a Final Fantasy-style menu screen. Voice acting has been added for the American release and it's quite good, surprisingly. Combat is now fully 3D, with animations of your characters executing their attacks. I could go on and on, because there's so much good stuff to talk about. Any fan of Final Fantasy or the like really needs to give this one a try."

"event","So, I devoted some more thought to the effect of ID in schools, and had an encouraging thought.

What kind of curriculum can you actually create around ID? I mean, <i>there's nothing to teach</i>. It has no history, no experiments, no data, no scientific publications (though I'm sure there's plenty of idiotic screeds published as books or other non-peer reviewed works), nothing that you can actually teach in a classroom besides rhetoric. 

As far as I can see, all you could really do as a teacher would be to say ""Ok, now we're going to talk about how life developed on earth. One theory is that some kind of intelligent force created and guided life on earth until it produced humans."" And then you're done. There's nothing else to say. That's the entirety of ID. After that, as a teacher, I'd just say ""Another theory is that life evolved over a great period of time through small genetic changes and natural selection. We'll spend the next 3 weeks discussing the history and methods of this theory, and will be performing experiments related to it in our next 3 lab units.""

If I were on a school board, and was approached re: ID, I think the way to handle it would be ""Ok, present me with a proposed curriculum, and we'll consider it."" I'm sure they'd submit something, but I'd hope that, in attempting to flesh out the empty rhetoric with actual substance, the idiocy of the entire line of thought would become very clear."

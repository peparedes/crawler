"event","The roomie and I just finished watching ""Love Actually."" The sigh. I had to run back into my room and get my beloved white tiger Mira to hug, because the happiness was just too much not to share hugs with something. 

When you're little, you watch love stories. You see things like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""The Sound of Music"" when you're 10 and you think this is how love is. Dramatic, certain and overwhelmingly happy. I used to want to be in a love story. 

Be careful what you wish for. 

Ever since - what was it, Will, May 12? - well, whatever it was, I have had that dubious pleasure. (And dammit, now we're going to have to have the anniversary talk again and it took me a year to figure that out the first time.) And I remember all the things that Hillary said - a girl who also, to her delight I'm sure, had the pleasure of honestly living a love story. Hillary said that these situations were awkward, scary and uncomfortable. 

True. But they are also dramatic, certain and overwhelmingly happy. 

And so I'm back to drawing hearts along the borders of my notes and smiling when I think of him. C said that he made me act like a girl again, and so he does. I'm not always the best girlfriend (not always, never, same difference, right?), but really, quite frankly, we do deserve each other, I think. 

I hope."

There are some nights where you just realize how lucky you are to be alive. 

I got out of my car at 12:15 this evening/morning and looked up at the Dipper and I knew. This whole winter, see, I've been looking up at Orion and watching him look down at me. I first loved him during those winter trips to Matoaka freshman year, and Orion reminded me of William and Mary and snuggling up in Eric's coat as he made fun of my susceptability to the cold. Now Orion is gone, but the summer skies beckon with a promise he left. 

Nothing this year has gone the way that I planned it, but it's going to be okay. This is, after all, life we're talking about here."

"event","Semester's almost OVER!! 

Today I did two very important things. I turned in my complete (COMPLETE!) First Year Paper draft, and I joined the American Political Science Association. I had to join, as I want to attend the APSA conference in August. They tell me that things like conferences are important to furthering my career. 

As far as the rest of my life (the non poli-sci part, that is), things seem to be going well. I was sick for a while last week, but I recovered. I'm adjusting relatively well to single life, even if Mindy says I'm boy crazy. ;-) I'm not, I just want to point out for the record. She's just not used to my more outspoken personality - it's not quite what I was like in high school. :-) 

I'm busy all the time, it seems these days. I've done a little bit of everything this semester, gone to several indie shows at Club Downunder, been canoeing out at the Rez (though it's not the same without Good Liz), gone out drinking with the boyz from poli-sci (and one in particular), witnessed said boys take on a frat in intermural dodgeball and, later that week, the rest of the department join them in city-league softball. 

Mostly, though, I've been myself, the quintessential Aquarian. I'm trying really hard to get everything together so that I'm a success at this whole grad school thing. I'm trying to learn how networking works, how to get twelve things done at once, how to convince everyone that yes, I know exactly what they're talking about and what author wrote what and all that. Thing is, grad school is as much flash as it is substance - something I did not expect and really have to adjust to. 

I said back in fall that the nicest thing about FSU was that everyone took me seriously here. Thing is, I'm not always the most serious, sober and staid individual. Worse, certain people in the department bring out the loopy side of me more often than they should. Well, rumor has it that I've done at least decently well at convincing people that I'm smart. The hardest thing now is that poli-sci still is a bit of a boys club. I'm becoming more feminista, I think, as the months drag on. That will at least please my roommate. 

Am I a success? To be sure, but it's a constant battle. 

Did things work out as I planned? Nope, not at all. 

Would I have anything any other way? Absolutely not. 

We're going to see how this is done."

"event","It's the new year, I suppose. I think this might be the first time in years I didn't actually see the ball drop, so it doesn't really feel like 2006. The plus side of the new year is that it makes my graduation date seem so much closer. ;-) 

In the tradition of new years, I do have a series of resolutions. Quite frankly, they were all things I wanted to start doing two months ago, but finals sort of made my free time nonexistent. Sigh. 

Mostly I want to improve my German, get at least back to reading fluency. Harder considering I'm not given time to take foreign language classes, but I've got books and Kate and several speakers in the program, so maybe. I'd like to take an art class, but I'm afraid to push it with my time now that I'm a research assistant. And I need to work out more. I really like working out, but it's one of those things that's easy to push aside in favor of other things. 

It's less the changing of the year and more the changing of the semester that gives me an opportunity to try and add things to my schedule. Sometimes I wonder if I'm not trying to do too much - but I'm already putting things aside to be done later, and I'm not going to step back and just wish them done. 

So yeah. I'm aware that resolutions normally fail, so I'm not expecting too much - but I've never actually made any with serious intentions, so we'll see. ;-)"

"event","Yay! I feel so happy because I have something to write about! 

Last week was the first time I'd done something crazy and fun in what feels like forever. I went to two concerts, two nights in a row, both sponsored by FSU. I didn't know much from either band (The Bravery and Stars, respectively), but I enjoyed it. The Bravery made me feel very old, as the show was populated by hipsters and hos, of which I am sadly neither. Stars was awesome - more my type of music, though I enjoyed The Bravery - but I prolly liked it best because I was standing in the front row and could have fun and forget that there were people behind me.

This update would have been sooner, but I had two tests yesterday and today. Now those are out of the way, and I have a few days clear sailing before I have to finish my First Year Paper draft. My advisor is awesome. Yeah. 

I think I might want to write a paper about economic signaling. Does anyone else think that sounds interesting? 

Talked a while with Ginny today. I do think a lot about the FH, though I don't really get much of a chance to talk to anyone there. Alejandro, I don't want to call the office if you're not around. When do you normally work? 

Anyway, I was talking with Ginny about being jaded, and I realized that I'm really not anymore. I was so bent on being rational and thinking logically that I forgot that some things weren't logical, some things weren't meant to be explained. I'm so lucky that I have Will to remind me of these things when I forget. 

I promised to say some words about November, as I believe it is the first entry of the month. My sophomore year, I decided that months had meanings. November to my freshman hall was evil; to me, it was liberation. It was in November that I learned to dream for the first time in my life. It was in November that I was able to let go of all my fears and embrace the joy of just living. And it is in November that I remember this, and allow myself to let go again. 

I said in my last entry that I was okay with not being completely in charge of my own life. It's true, and it might be the first time in my life that I can say that. There are things I want more than independence. There are more important things in life than being right. Agency, you know, the idea that you are ever only partially in control of your life. There are worse things than giving up some of that. There are worse things than letting go. 

So do it. Treat yourself like a princess."

Homecoming was great, I got to see almost everyone I wanted to, which was very nice. Kinda weird to hear about how much has changed, weirder still in that some things haven't changed at all. 

And I still don't like the people I don't like. Ah, that's reassuring. Though some people have greater myopia than I thought...

Basically, I work most of the time now. It's incredibly busy and everything seems more important. My dining room table has been taken over by my First Year Paper readings, a paper that is currently progressing from non-existant to disaster, which I suppose is an improvement. But it's nice to have a challenge. I want it to be at least a conference paper and if I'm lucky, an article. But I'm told not to get too carried away this early in my career. 

Should try to figure out some things before too long, like when I want to graduate and when I want to go abroad, but it's not entirely up to me and I'm okay with that. For once.

"event","Oh, to be 20 and punch drunk on love again. 

Driving down a deserted highway in Jersey with your best friend beside you, giggling like mad at every other word she says, believing that anything is possible, right now, at that moment. Snuggled up warm in her sweatshirt, talking about love, wondering what will happen next. Will you make it to that defining moment, the Six Month Mark? What will that mean? 

You've got your journal in the bag at your feet, the one with all your Deepest Thoughts in it. Or more likely, the various crushes of the moment you've had over the years, the boys with the hearts drawn by their names, the ones who got away and the ones you wish had. It has the angst of unrequited love and the bitter tang of disappointment, healed over by the new promises of yet another sweet tongued male. Maybe he's the one? Maybe this time there will be flowers on Valentine's Day? 

No, it couldn't ever last a year. A year is a long time! You can't fathom a relationship that can't be counted in months. You whisper a little bit when you talk about friends who've inched up on that mark, or maybe even passed it. It is a hush born from respect. They have Something. 

You tuck your feet up under you, leaning toward your bestest friend ever in an unnecessary gesture of confidentiality. No, you haven't really thought about what will happen in May. My gosh! May's OVER a year. You don't want to say that by then there will probably be another boy, with hearts around his name. That would be a betrayal of the crush. At the same time, you have so little faith that he'll still be interested by then. Boys are so fickle. 

You know there's always someone better, hotter, sweeter. And yet...it doesn't feel that way at the moment. You're driving 65 miles an hour in the middle of nowhere, the sun is shining, and you KNOW that you are more beautiful at this moment than you have ever been in your life, because you are happy. It seems just as impossible that this moment won't last a lifetime. It HAS to, because you are in love. 

It's more than that, though. Being in love is only a small part of the joy of the moment, the joy of your life. You love more than him, you love everything about your life, from the classes you left behind you to the sunshine to the spirit of adventure that has touched everything you've done since leaving school. Of course you bring that love to the relationship. Of course you have the energy to be everything. 

Your friend says something cute about her boyfriend, and you laugh. By the time he takes her away from you, you'll be like sisters. You're already sisters, in your hearts. You love her boyfriend because she does, and anything that makes her happy is perfect. She loves yours for the same reason, and constantly reassures you that everything is okay, really, she's been dating longer than you and she knows. Of course, she's not really sure of that...but it doesn't matter. 

Because everything is going to work out. You know it."

"event","I've been meaning to update for at least a week now, but I never can seem to find the words to say when I'm actually faced with my computer. I think there's an aura of unreality about things right now. I feel like everything before Grad School was just a dream, a dream life where classes didn't run an hour over, where food didn't cost so much, and you had at least 3 weeks notice to write a 10 page paper. 

I think that's why I'm so excited about Homecoming. I've started to wonder if William and Mary ever happened. I always made fun of alums whose memory ended at Commencement (poor Rob, who returned Dan's call on Thursday morning and wondered if we'd finished production...), but I see where it comes from. I don't really keep too much in touch with people...I can't think of anything interesting to say. ""I wrote a paper today and read 100 pages of IR theory. Made plans to meet my cohort at Pockets Friday night."" 

But I love grad school. It's so hard to explain how wonderful I find all the work. I keep thinking up things I want to research. The thing about grad school, if you want to do something, then they'll help you do it. No matter what you're planning, you're allowed to do it. There's not this emphasis on staying within guidelines, and everyone's willing to recommend at least 3 books or articles to help you figure out where to go with your project. 

On that note, I have some people to e-mail about my First Year Paper topic. Rather, the like 12 topics I have now after the first day of faculty presentations. ;-) I should wait until everyone's presented. Then I'll have about 30. 

There are so many opportunities now, it's amazing. I want to write all 12 papers. It's different when you're doing it out of love, and not because a prof's making you. 

I wish that I could have everything I want. I wish that I had time to read everything, to work with everyone, to do everything. There are so many tradeoffs. The more I make polisci my life, the more I can get done. The more I don't, the more things I can do and people I can meet or keep in touch with. 

It's hard to reconcile this academic freedom with my utter lack of control over everything else sometimes. I find myself thinking about the same things over and over. I keep telling myself to e-mail people who I haven't talked to in forever, and yet no matter how much I remember to do this, I still can't seem to get it done. I find myself wondering about abstract things like friendship and love, especially love, and what it means. In a discipline where definitions are everything...in a world where so much is indefinable...

I've also taking to obsessing about my appearance. I've gotten more conscientious about what I wear over the years, but now I've gone from wondering if I look good in something to wondering if I look good at all. At first I justified it to myself because, ceteris paribus, pretty people do better. But nope. I think that I am, generally speaking, pretty. But I wish that there was a way to tell if that was true. Besides asking everyone. I don't like their answers. 

Another abstract. Perhaps it's bad to hold oneself to ideals. But is it always bad? An abstract of beauty is impossible; I'll never be Aphrodite, and indeed I don't want to be. (I'll leave that to Kate.) But I don't know about everything. To try and be Best, to have the Best, can be as inspiring as it can be overwhelming. As soon as I figure out what that is. 

Anyway, I'm going to read about how to write research papers now. So that I have time to go to the concert tomorrow night. ;-)"

Sigh. 

Yum. I can't wait to get started - I have to go photocopy stuff tomorrow and get started on reading. I think I'm going to jot down some notes about the articles - readings are on JSTOR and are thus unprintable, and even my memory will start going at about article #5. AND one of my readings was written by my old Intro to IR prof...so, um, yeah, I thought that was pretty weird. AND I've read stuff by almost all the authors listed on the syllabus, so I guess W&M prepared me better than I thought. 

The Grad Director is familiar with W&M, btw. He refered to ""The College."" We are so damn pretentious. ;-) 

Well, THE Florida State University will prolly still be here after Hurricane/Tropical Storm Katrina, and I'm just hoping that I don't have too much trouble driving to class on Monday. (And yes, it really is The Florida State Univeristy, but that's only used on the most official documents. Like The College of William and Mary in Virginia.) 

And I found a Death Cab song I sorta like. Weird, no? 

I get to do so many cool things here. I hope that I'll finally get to do what I want, instead of trying to conform to W&M's absolutely implacable curriculum of What is Right in IR. I mean, I'm grateful to The College for the strong foundation it gave me, but I'm so excited to move on to a place where people don't stare at me blankly and send me to the Econ Department. (Charlene, guess you understand how absolutely annoying a department's prejudices get...but you're the only example I can think of.) 

I'm next door to the library, which has Georgette Heyer books and is thus awesome. I'm across from Landis Green - known during warm weather as Landis Beach, due to the large amount of sunbathers. (Landis Hall, the dorm across from the library, is the Honors Dorm, and where I guess I would have lived had I attended FSU four years ago.) 

I have an FSU e-mail account, but for personal correspondence will continue to use my gmail, as my FSU account is a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers. I have access to FSU Blackboard, and unlike some of my cohort, know how to use it - I about cried when this one girl asked me if I'd used it before. Flashbacks of Hutton's weekly quizzes arose before my eyes. When I explained this, a guy asked me if they could really put quizzes on Blackboard, and then I really wanted to cry, remembering, ohyes, Hutton's ESSAYS on Blackboard. Sigh. 

I cooked hamburgers for dinner tonight and they were yummy. Yay for investing in good cheddar cheese. 

AND, as Sara's earlier post reminded me, I DESPERATELY need new workout music. Can some people suggest good FAST songs, preferably ones I wouldn't come up with on my own, for a new workout mix? 

Working out at the complex is so awesome. I wonder if I'll ever make it to Leach, I'm so happy with my apartment's weight training/cardiovascular center. A good elliptical is love.

Did ""tomorrow come too soon""? Impossible to say. There's nothing to stop tomorrows, after all. Usually a good thing, in my opinion, because they bring great, well, Promise. When you have to stop running and look where you are...oh, it's only then you see the beauty of your trip.

Whoa. 

Perhaps this summer is the last time that I will have all this time to think about things. I expect things will get busy before too long, and stay busy for...about the rest of my life. So I'd better begin as I mean to go on. 

Now. What exactly is that plan? 

There have been so many life-changing things on my mind lately. Mostly about how I'm moving ahead with my life, and this always necessitates deciding what to leave behind. I get to escape from the pain and disappointments that marked my experience at W&M, yet I have the option to bring the best of my experiences there with me. As a wise woman said, ""think only of the past as its remembrance brings you pleasure."" 

At the same time, what does that mean? 

There are always two ways to think. You can think with your head, and you can think with your heart. It is fair to say that I only learned how to think with my heart at W&M. I was always quite a rational creature before I went to college and fell in love with so many things in life. I escaped back to that rationality when my heart would get broken. When you love, after all, you put yourself outside of your own control. And no matter what Mindy says, you cannot go back again. 

When I returned to Florida living, I was determined not to let rationality run my life again. It is true that in matters of the heart you are more likely to suffer, but then, are not the risks what lead to the joys of living? 

Only...there was one problem. My heart wanted too much. 

The answer to that was, of course, to consider the problems rationally. The obstacles could be reasoned away in such a manner as to make them less personal. The answer is to become inured to disappointment, immune to pain. 

How is that an answer for anything? 

Is Florida State going to be my salvation? Will there my heart be allowed to get what it wants? Will the pain be replaced by pleasure, and the aching crush of disappointment be lifted at last? 

I do not know. But there is always hope. 

We all suffer under the burdens of what we want and do not have. But the objectives change as you go on. What you wanted as a freshman or a sophomore is not the same as what you want as a senior. As a grad student. The life I envisioned for myself back then is so much less than what I look forward to now. Part of me is afraid the same will be true again in four years. 

If life shifts so much, how can you ever feel certain? 

And there are some things you want to be certainties. 

And there are some things that are certainties. It is a matter of finding them out. 

It is a matter of seeing the similarities. It is a matter of seeing the truth."

My ""candy sticks"" were Spiderman brand, and came with a temporary tattoo. I think I'll save that for when I next see my boyfriend. 

I looked at Flagler for a bit and mused on whether I looked young enough to try and take the tour - general consensus was yes, but I didn't make the attempt. As I told my mom, I don't need to tour Flagler, I kinda went there. Or at least to Virginia's version. 

Then at the Castillo de San Marco, I got to relive the past with some Spanish colonials, who fired off a cannon out into the Intercoastal Waterway. Boom! I almost fell off the seawall in surprise. I felt so bad for the colonials out in the 95 degree heat. I got sunburned in my tank top, I can't imagine what it would be like in military uniform circa 1565. 

The Bridge of Lions is undergoing renovation, and so they'd removed the lions. I checked out the plans for the renovation - they're building a new bridge, repairing the Bridge of Lions and then tearing down the new bridge. Craziness! I kept checking the plans over and over again, because they seemed so nonsensical. 

A drive up A1A let me pass ""my"" house and sigh over how much it must cost. Dinner at Cruisers in Jax Beach finished the day on the right note. :-) 

It's nice to just do something fun and get away for a while."

It was really cool, but kinda like a trip back to high school. Her neighborhood's changed a lot since I was last there. We talk about people we hear about but don't keep in touch with - Munchie's engaged? I need someone to confirm that one. We play old music and remember...she put in my favorite mix cd from high school, the one I played in the bus coming home from Grad Nite, when I was in love with the world, the one I played driving to graduation. 

We talk more about next year - next month - and what we have to do. What we're going to do. 

I promised Mindy's mother that I would ""loosen her daughter's conservative strictures."" Mindy's mom's a trip. Witness this conversation: 

Mindy's Mom: You have a boyfriend? 
Me: Yes. 
Mindy's Mom: Where's he from? 
Me: Virginia.
Mindy's Mom: Is he still in Virginia?
Me: Yes. 
Mindy's Mom: Oh. Then you don't have a boyfriend. 
Me: Umm...
Mindy's Mom: If you're in Florida and he's in Virginia then he can't be your boyfriend. 
Me: Er...
Mindy's Mom: Or you could still date him, and tell him that as long as he's in Virginia, you're dating Joe. And Sam. And Vernon. 
Me: I would NEVER date a Vernon! 

She also lectured me on how I ""thought too much about relationships"" because I was planning to bring home a Hot Political Science Boy for Mindy. 

I let the mix CD play as I drove home. I remembered lunches spent on the floor of Mr. Warren's portable, listening to Christy's ""Man on the Moon"" soundtrack and thinking about life as the others debated philosophy. I never spent a lunch in the cafeteria - every year there was a space somewhere else. 

Today we talked about how, for the first time, we would have to buckle down and really work hard. It scares me a little - how can there be this much work, that I must work ever harder? 

I would like to make another trip to Virginia before I go off to school in August. Any suggestions from the peanut gallery? There were a lot of things I never got to do, and a lot of people it would be really fun to see."

The thing is, though, I'm really content right now. If right now there are only errands, well, there are plenty of those. There are always free elliptical machines at the gym and I still haven't finished that biography of Theodora. What's more, I've supplimented it with a history of Florida. I figure that will take up some time as well. 

I'm working on two stories at the moment, both, I believe, kid lit. One of them is a tale I've been spinning for about 10 years, and only now do I think it should be committed to paper. Both are fantastic in nature. I love them. 

I play computer games and I think, about what I need in my life and what's in store for me. I'm sometimes bored, but I have the reassurance that life is about to get far more interesting. I know that I have enough money to live, comfortably enough. And I know I can do this. I just want to get started. 

I haven't been home long enough for things to become routine. There are still seasons of CSI to catch up on, and I'm looking forward to Empire, though I'll prolly criticize it as well. I miss people from school, and I want to send e-mails, only I have nothing of interest to say. What is there? ""Next year will be filled with strawberry daquiris and lots of nights on LexusNexus, slaving over Stata and writing up a storm. It will be filled with political science people and my roommate's law school friends, none of whom I've met yet.""

My beloved Kate wanted me to most particularly mention her, and her snuggle goodness. This should be easy, as she was there. 

The baseball game was fun - Ginny joined me and Kate, Nat and Jeremy to watch the Nationals kill the Mariners. I had such a great time, it almost made me wish I lived in a city with a major league baseball team. Sunday we went to the Textile Museum, fulfilling a long ago wish, and met up with Patrick at the Museum of the American Indian. When that closed, we hightailed it to some tea shop of Patrick's choice, hitting up the Pride festival on our way. I annoyed Kate and Patrick by stopping too long to look at the booths and almost losing them in the crowd. :-( But I had this delicious mango margarita at the tea place, and so I quickly forgot about, well, everything. ;-) Patrick is awesome. 

I left her on Monday, having not seen so many people. I'm considering a return visit, but I don't know when. Ideas? 

Right now I'm in Hampton visiting Will, who did NOT ask to make the livejournal. ;-) He's at work and I've stolen his computer to play Oregon Trail. I lived to the end! I was so excited. I think I might play again, if I can come up with another ridiculous name...I always like to name my Oregon Trail characters things that no one else would ever consider names.

"event","Mmm. I spent much of last evening curled up on the couch reading Pride and Prejudice. It's probably been years since I reread it in its entirety, and it was as delightful as I remembered. 

I first read P&P when I was in the 8th grade, when Austen was fashionable. I love reading books with characters named Elizabeth; it suits my vanity to a high degree. But I never fully identified with Miss Bennet - my life lacked a Darcy, and while my middle school (and later high school, and still later college) did not lack for the proud arrogant type (YOU try attending an academic magnet, they own the place), I saw no one who could measure up to my standards. 

I consoled myself. After all, Lizzy Bennet did not meet Mr. Darcy until she was ""not yet one-and-twenty."" 

Instead, I found myself identifying with Elinor Dashwood, the lovely elder sister of Austen's Sense and Sensibility. Elinor understood things. She was rational, always putting her mind to her heart. S&S ends with Elinor in hysterics, when her true love Edward admits he returns her passion, and finally causes her to face the facts that sometimes, your heart does win out. 

But I ignored that part of the story, to be honest. I did not want my heart to win out. Elinor was a beautiful woman, an artist, the head of her silly family. I admired her composure in the face of deep unrequited love. It was the type of love I was most familiar with, after all. 

Persuasion was slow to be appreciated, if I were to be honest. The first time I read it I thought it rather dull. Eventually I was to realize the seductiveness of that particular variation of the romantic plot, the Woman Who Waits. Anne Elliot was indeed that woman, remaining constant to her Captain Wentworth for eight years. Then when he returned and used her abominally ill, she retained her love in the face of this treatment. After all, underneath it he really loved her too. 

I plan to reread Persuasion over the next few days - I could use a role model on grace in patience. Anne has ""lost her bloom"" at the advanced age of seven-and-twenty...so I've got less than 5 years of beauty ahead of me in the Jane Austen school of thought. This means I'll be an old maid by the time I finish grad school. Ah well. Liz has helpfully reminded me of the many advantages grad school will offer, so I think I'll muddle through somehow and not be too concerned about the ravages of time on my appearance. ;-) 

This discourse on Jane Austen is brought to you by the Willowbranch location of the Jacksonville Public Library, which does not have a good enough stock of my usual fluff romances and caused me to turn to some reliable favorites. And I'll warn you now - I'm currently reading my favorite book in the Whole Wide World, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre."

Was a tad late for the picnic, which I feel bad about because I think I helped delay it (and confuse Max). But Ginny, my marvelous new little, somehow got everyone to take out the boats this time.

"event","I was rereading my old pre-livejournal the other day. I inflicted a lot of the entries on Kate, thinking about how my life (and writings) have changed. One of the things she commented on was how much less guarded I was back then. I was willing to talk about being in love, about being upset, about most everything really that I thought I could get away with in my social group. 

I thought I would try, for old times sake, just one more of those. 

Right now I'm alone in my room. William just left and I'm worried about him driving home and whether he's mad at me. It kills me that I only have a week left before I have to leave and it makes me a little snippy with him, because I'm scared. 

I'm talking to Chelsea on IM. This semester she's really helped make my life. She's the only person from my freshman hall that I'm still really close to, and it's nice to have my first friend at college still in my life. She's done so many wonderful things for me over these 4 years and I've never managed to convince her how great of an impact she's had on my life. 

I wish I were still as tight with Emilia. I understand that she has new friends and she has to spend a lot of time with Patrick, but I'm sad that she doesn't really have time to just hang out. It also saddens me that she's only been by my room twice this year, and that going by the lodge makes me uncomfortable. I am happy, though, that I still feel like she's my friend. 

My life changed forever spring of my sophomore year. I met my best friend, I started going out with my boyfriend, I lost my all-encompassing love of the Flat Hat and the person who meant the most to me there. The people who meant the most to me there. 

Of the older generation of Flat Hatters (by which I mean the classes of '02 and '03), I still have that connection to about half of them. And I love that, that I can still love a part of what I loved back then. I love that Dan ('05) was such a damn good manager that he allowed me to recapture some of that as Exec. I love that I got to spend another semester with Whitney, though there is a part of me that is truly distraught that she left this semester. Your little isn't supposed to leave before you. 

Other truths...I wish I remembered Belle's e-mail address. I want to e-mail her, but I don't remember it. hername at gmail? I wish that I'd been able to see Shaun when I went to FSU, and I really hope we can be friends again because I really enjoyed hanging out with him in high school. 

I want to see Lindsay when she comes next weekend for Joe's graduation, but I don't have much faith that she'll be able to make the time for me because I'm not that important in her life. I know that, just as I know that I'm not important to many people who are important to me. 

I wish I could always just be honest about things to everyone. I wish that Lisa hadn't hated me for being honest with her. 

To stop this from becoming maudlin, though, I'd like to talk about the OTHER topic I don't discuss. Things that make me happier than the world. Or more specifically, the two most important people in my life, who make me happier than the world. 

Kate is the best friend a girl could ever ask for. She's willing to listen to whatever is bothering me, she snuggles with me when I cry, she knows how to measure stuff without measuring cups, she dances with me to Dschinghis Khan...she's just wonderful. I don't know if I would have made it through the year without her. 

And William. I don't talk about him much here because I don't want to be one of those girls who only talks about her boyfriend. I also am aware that I have a mixed audience, and that there are people who prolly don't want to hear about my love life. 

But...he's so much a part of my life that it seems so bizarre to just see him mentioned here in passing. I just celebrated my two-year anniversary, for crying out loud. William is living proof that the absolute best things in life tend to be the most unexpected. So much of my life is better because of him. I haven't always been easy to deal with (hah! understatement!) but he's just been amazing, and better than I deserve. If I were doing nothing, but was with him, I think I'd be perfectly happy. I might pester him to talk to me, though. ;-)

There are so many things to say that I've never said. But it feels good to make a start."

""If I had one wish, I would wish for two

It makes up for all the times this year when I've had to swallow my anger at people doing shit. This is for all the times I didn't get to yell at Stephen or Dan. At UCF (though I made up for that by being quite annoying to them and USC). I'd been meaning to talk to IT about the brusqueness and well, threatening tone of their correspondence, so I'm glad to bring it up with them. I've only got two months left, I'm not afraid of making myself a nuisance. 

I'm glad I got lots of sleep last night, because there won't be time for a nap today. There's barely time for lunch. And I really should go and take care of things...I've done nothing but run around trying to get things done and I don't appreciate more things being added to it by stupid bureaucracy.


Edit: 
So they're removing my hold. Apparently it's not usually the thing to have holds on people who pay their bills. Good to know. :-P"

"event","Well. This weekend was devoted to grad school consideration. 

I went down to visit FSU on Friday and spent the whole day talking with students and professors about the joys of political science. I have to say, it was really nice. The students were really nice and friendly and they seemed like people I could be friends with. The profs were cool and had interesting things to say. I could totally see myself getting along with these people, which is good, because it's prolly where I'll end up. 

While USC accepted me, they didn't offer me any sort of fellowship. Maybe they will, but it would have to be a lot for me to be able to afford living in Los Angeles. And I really don't want to have $80,000 of debt when I graduate. Not even a little bit. 

So it's a good thing that I liked FSU. Because I did. I keep thinking about the people and thinking how much fun it would be to hang out and study statistics with them all. And that's maybe a little sad. ;-) 

In other news, I went to my Last Sunday Meeting of The Flat Hat. I have a hot family after the dust settles, and I am pleased as I can be. I sense that the process was similar to last year's, and I mean that in the Bad Way, but I really feel like I tried as hard as I could to fight that. Which I guess I didn't feel like last year. Besides, I've learned these things don't matter after a while. 

And Kate was supposed to meet me after FH to go out for margaritas, but she stood me up. :-("

"event","I know it's been a while since I found the time to update this. Basically, every time I sat down to update I couldn't think of a way to finish. I feel like I have a lot to think about. 

Everyone has their own ideas as to what I should do and where I should go and what I should be. It's a lot of pressure, trying to deal with all these requests and still feel like I'm acting for me. It's been a frustrating time, and today, after calling USC and making them PROMISE to e-mail me tomorrow as to if I got it, I thought that maybe LA wasn't such a bad idea. After all, it's been my dream for just about my whole life, and if I weren't so worried about everything, I'm sure I'd be more concerned about what that e-mail says tomorrow. I applied to USC in the face of opposition from just about everyone. 

I admire people who know exactly what it is that they want. I know that I want to be successful, and that there are many ways I can do so. I have differing paths open to me at the moment, and I can be happy with whatever choice I make. The thing is, I don't want other people running my life, and I worry that I might be caving in. I worry that I don't know I'm caving in. 

I'm excited about my official visit to FSU this week. I hope I'll get a chance to see Shaun, since I haven't since graduation. I really liked Tallahassee, and I can see myself living there. That was the reason I chose W&M four years ago, the thought I could see myself happy here, so I think that's a good sign. I realize that I'm a capable adult now (meaning I should prolly start wearing makeup and stuff...) and that I could make my own decisions. And cook meals, and everything. 

My visit means I won't be in town for editor announcements. This saddens me in part, because Flat Hat has been so important to me, but it gladdens me too. It reminds me that this is something I don't have to worry about anymore. I get a little at Exec and a tri-little at Variety, and anything that expands my family makes me happy. 

Dan said that he thought the family system had gotten ""out of control."" He thinks that Exec Staff doesn't have families; that Lindsay, for example, is not his big. Now, this is going to sound stupid, but I really really LOVED the fact that I had a new family when I became Exec, and I wouldn't give up anything that made me related to Dan Miller, who was the first person ever to tell me I wasn't a waste of space. 

That's the thing, I really love people. I want to make people happy, and if I can do it, I'll prolly try my best. If I don't get in to USC tomorrow, then I'll never work for Variety. Applying there was my last gasp of hope for that dream. If I do get in, then it becomes my choice. I have to think about that this evening, so I know what to expect. How will it make me feel, to not get in and know that dream will never, never be a reality? How will it feel, to realize that it might still be in my grasp? And, most chillingly, how will it feel to realize that I might have a newer, greater dream? 

One of those will happen tomorrow. 

We all grow and change, and staying in touch with that which is essentially you is the most vital part of life. And I'm scared about that, scared that I'm not sure what is most important to my future happiness. Scared that I'm so excited about FSU, scared that I'm so worried about USC. Scared that I'll disappoint people. Scared that my families won't miss me in three weeks. 

Fear and joy do come together. Neither is complete without the other."

Still have my FSU visit next week! Am starting to worry about if USC comes up with something, I'm running out of time for all these visits. Because I'm totally using that as an excuse to visit LA. 

Today we're dashing out to Tallahassee to look around at apartments and what-not. Short busy visit. In fact, I should be getting ready to go instead of writing here. But oh well. 

So the good break continues. :-)"

It's been a lot of fun this weekend, hangin' out at the College. Fun times in Norfolk despite the rain, finally traversing the Governor's Palace maze, accidental amusement with a bottle of wine. The weather got nice yesterday and today I got to walk around outside without a jacket for the first time in months. 

But tonight, it's nach Hause, specifically my dad's. Tuesday is fun with Minday and Wednesday it's off to Tallahassee (my future home?). Pity we prolly won't be at FSU proper that much, but there's time for that next week and my official visit. That's squared away too. 

Getting near time for me to shut down the computer for break and pack up the car. Hot stuff!"

"event","I've been on an art kick recently. I'm checking out books from Swem to get ideas of what kind of art I want in my post-WM place. I used interlibrary loan to get two books of illustrations and a book on Icelandic art. I'm hoping to get inspired from there. 

If anyone knows of some good, unique art, let me know. While I like Renoir and famous artists too, I'm looking for some different kinds of things than I can get prints of at the nearest mall. 

It's nice to have something to be interested in. It's also suddenly apparent to me that I have so much to do before the end of the year. Luckily, I have some time before I go home for break to get some of that accomplished. So tomorrow it's off to the Pottery for some all important shopping. I need a $6 set of goblets. And maybe a vase, but I have two, so maybe not. 

The thought of a place of my own is very exciting. And it's so near! I'm sad that I'll be graduating soon, because that means my days of carefree travel are almost over. I wanted to visit people before it was too late. If I don't get to see people now, I don't know when I'll get a chance. And it would be fun to see a bunch of the high school people as well as some of my old college friends. Maybe things will work out still though. 

Tomorrow, after the Pottery, William and I are headed off on a day trip! I bet we get lost at least once. ;-) Excellent. 

It's looking like a very nice future. I wish I could hear from USC so I can be completely certain though..."

Studying is going. I spent several hours on Russian Myths before Campus Golf and the Tupperware movie, both of which were incredibly awesome. Today I've completed the remainder of my Roman Britain reading, and will soon commence map learning and note rereading. I'm relatively pleased with my progress. 

Now I intend to finish my sandwich while rereading my new book and then go back to studying. :-)"

"event","Currently at home in Florida. I hope I hope I hope I can make it back on Tuesday. 

I watched ""Troy"" again tonight and decided I need to reread the Iliad. I can't remember who killed Glaucus. It's the details that are important, huh? Maybe I should try and learn Greek instead of Latin...but I think Latin will be more useful, inasmuch as either ancient Greek and Latin are ever ""useful."" 

The tragic thing about the Iliad is that you know no matter what, that Hector and Achilles are going to fight and die. The same is true I guess of life. You know that certain things will happen. Some people will grow apart, never see each other again. Some will be happy and some will not. We all try as best we can to hold onto the important things. But things sometimes do just happen the way they happen. 

It's not that I think our decisions are made for us, or that we don't have control over them. I'm the biggest advocate of human agency. I just think that sometimes you worry and worry about things that end up just happening. You're a product of your past and your dreams and your fears, and those things set limits on who you will become. If you believe internally that you are destined to be great, that limits what you will settle for. The point is to use those things to your own advantage. 

You use your own value system to make your choices in life. What one person believes of the utmost importance can be a side note to someone else. This can cause pain if you want agreement; it can be a relief if you're afraid of interference. 

The thing is, value systems are not immediately apparent. It's impossible to know what someone else considers necessary until they're faced with not having it. It's often impossible to know what you yourself consider necessary until you literally don't have it at all. There are things that it is okay to be wrong about. There are things that it is not. 

Lauren told me something that I am not sure I agree with. She told me that communication was the key. But communication is fraught with difficulty. There are things you are afraid to say. There are things you shouldn't say. There are definitely things I don't say in hallway discussions, because I'm sick of people telling me I'm wrong. Perhaps the measure of success in communication is when it's not everything, when it's just an extension of being. 

I've never conciously chosen to communicate. People have tried to force me to in the past - they learned that that was a mistake. If I feel something is not to be said, it does not get said. If I feel it needs to, it does. But I don't choose these things, I just do them. Just like I live my life. I just do it. I know what's right for me and what's wrong, and things work themselves out. 

This is why life is not like mythology. In myth everyone knows their limits - Patroclus was to get three advances with three rushes each, where he killed three men in each rush. But when he went for number 28 - Prince Hector - that was his end. It was no accident. Know thyself meant to know your place, and in myth that's fairly exact. Here things get messy. It means you can always be surprised at how much you can do. Sometimes you get that 28th try. 

It will all be settled in a month. Can you believe it?"

I mean, there's been all the single ones, and though I never felt like it was a bad thing to be single, Valentine's Day does seem designed to rub it in. Last year's was excellent, but...shall we say, a little untraditional? With the best ending ever! ;-) I can be so sketchy sometimes. 

This V-Day is off to a great start. I have my interviews scheduled for Flat Hat, and I think the questions will be fun and great. Ninjas, pirates or zombies? I wonder what TJ thinks? My 10 a.m. was cancelled, and I found FSU's version of Banner Web so I can see what I might be getting myself into. 

Oh, and William and I are hanging out tonight, if you're a traditionalist. :-) I also have a LOT of flowers. And candy.

I got my funding information from Florida State. Let's just say I'm heavily considering the fact that I could be a Lady Seminole. Ooh, even typing that is hot! I'm going to go visit a few times, get a feel for the program and the city, but I'm getting really excited about it, obviously. I can't believe that next time this year I could have my own place that I can sustain myself, and in three years after that, I could be receiving a doctorate. 

Other than that, I've been talking to a lot of people and I just felt really connected and cool and fun. It's nice to have friends, even when they drive you crazy. It's nice to be appreciated. 

On that, I heart the white roses and carnations on my desk. It's one of the nice things about Valentine's Day. I don't get flowers very often, and I love them when I do. It's special. 

Kate brought me more special twist ties, so I'm going to make another fancy ring. ;-) It will be hot. I just hope I have enough gold..."

I'm reading this biography of Peter the Great and I'm really getting into it. Right now it's my armrest, but after I type this I'm going to curl up in bed and read. That is, if the theatre people don't get back to me...I'm s'posed to write an article for Ginny. I'm three for three this semester on article-writing. Lots of clips, huh? And I don't really need them. 

This is the first time all day I've had time to sit and chill. It's been psycho busy! I watched another German movie today, Metropolis, which was so full of things to analyze that it took me forever to write my response, mostly because I couldn't decide what was most important. I can't wait until class tomorrow, I know Frau Taylor will have plenty to say as well. 

I signed up to moderate Kate's honors thesis. Next week. Everyone should come!

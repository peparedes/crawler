Junior history major Matthew Simone studies for his midterms in the reading room at the Student Learning Center Thursday. He has three tests today and expected to study for them until at least midnight. While he feels overwhelmed, he offers advice to other students who are in similar situations: ""Don't fall behind in the reading."" Thursday marked the official midpoint of the semester, and the official midpoint withdrawal deadline is Tuesday."

"event","The following are from our weekly entertainment section.  I found the layout to be so horrendous and the picture selection so less than stellar that I told them not to put my name on it.  Here is a sampling of the crap they ran (with the exception of the portrait.  That was actually a good picture that ran too small).

Sophomore Erin Mahone discusses the controversy surrounding part of an exhibit in Myers Hall devoted to Charlayne Hunter-Gault at an NAACP meeting Thursday night. ""Until the University of Georgia stops having these race relation issues in the news every week, our welcoming environment is going to continue to go downhill,"" she said.

-I had a good time at this shoot.  It was a last-minute deal, but well worth it.  Lots of other media there.  I gave out my card to an AJC reporter.  It was a fascinating informal debate about history and racial sensitivity.   Strangely enough, I had a dream that night that black people hate me.  Maybe I was just channeling the anxiety of the white housing authority at the meeting who made the mistake of saying ""some of my best friends are black."""

To add insult to injury, the edited version didn't make it to the layout department, so they printed the uncontrasted version, which ended up looking like shit as the dominant image on the front page of the paper."

"event","Today's paper was a little upsetting.  They sent me around town the day before to shoot a bunch of pictures of Athens landmarks so they could make a collage for dominant art.  They send me to shoot buildings a whole lot.  Buildings are boring.  Anyhow, they didn't do the collage and ended up putting a nonsensical picture of the Georgia Theater I took as dominant art.  What made matters worse was that there was no cutline for it.  People came up to me throughout the day to ask what it meant.  Ineptitude all around, folks.  We'll get over it.  I hope.

This was a crap follow up to the first tsunami garage sale picture.  This is the actual garage sale in progress.  I had a lot of good pictures from this event, but unfortunately, when I got the names of the ladies I shot as I was leaving, I was asked not to print their names or pictures in the paper because they were Jehovah's Witnesses and didn't want to be publicly associated with an event that donated money to the Red Cross.  They don't support the organization because they don't believe in giving blood. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v109/frenesi/RandB/kentuckyv.jpg"">
This was a fantastic picture that should have run dominant.  We got trounced by Kentucky and this shot really shows that.  They were showboating toward the end and making slam dunks, much to the chagrin of the Georgia fans.  The faces of the fans in the background are what make this picture, but they ran it way too small to the point where you couldn't distinguish any of the expressions.  I was sad.  Oh well.

I might add that all three of these pictures ran on the front page today.  Honestly, I think that's overkill."

yea well i jsut got grounded. came home from a shit day, asked my mom something and it turned into us yelling at each other for about ten minutes, then she yells im grounded. im so sick of this crap. ali gets away with watever the hell she wants and i got a hawk watching over me telling me wat i can and cannot do. the worst part is i listen to all of it. i realized i got no guts, and hardly a self worth or esteem and it erupts into all this crap, and its from growing up with my mom. i now have a problem with starving myself and its her fault. always trying to be good enough so maybe for once she wont have to look over my shoulder or yell at me and just say ""hey, good job jazz, im proud of u."" no. i hate the fact that home is supposed to be my haven, but its far from it. i been thinkin about going to live with my aunt in georgia when high school is up. but then again who knows if i even got the fucking guts to do it. i live in a fear that stops me short of everything, even thinking of wat the hell i want anymore. and thats really sad."

today was a really bad day. it was just one of those days where ""it just keeps getting better and better"" ::sarcastic tone::. and i realized last night, i wouldn't be able to live with my dad if it wasn't for my sister and my mom. i thought i was gona pack up and go to georgia cuz my dad was such an ass. and i have alot of hw to do but i dont care about it. im just sitting here listening to bright eyes wishing i was somewhere else, or that somebody was here to just sit next to me and hug me, let me cry on there shoulder, or pour out my heart in their hands and have them put it in a safe place. its amazing how one person can change everything in a second and suddenly the things u thought u had under control kinda poofed away and u realized u actually didnt have any control, even from the start. its a pretty depressing thought. u can question yourself all day why the hell u stick around and come up with only a couple reasons and wow thats just fucking depressing. and as the tears well up in my eyes i feel like ive gotten nowhere and am losing myself. things that i thought i knew i dont. and the only thing i can hold on to is love from certain ppl. it floors me. it also amazes me how a person can indirectly be crying out to someone and they dont even see it, or dont care too. its assholes like my dad last night that cause me to write this whole fucking entry when i once hated livejournal. and after all this i still feel completely stupid and retarded. just fucking stupid. i guess ill just wait for my lil -up- roller coaster to come around so i can go back to thinking i have everything under control and not feel stupid anymore. whatever."

im going to the chilli cook off tomorrow. i wana kill myself like right now. im totally wishing i never bought that stupid ticket on friday. 32 stinken bucks tho so u better bet ur butt im going. i just hope its not totally miserable.

im applying for this program at BCC called The College Academy. its really cool and really elite. the only stinky part would be if i got accepted i wouldnt be going to cshs anymore, my new school would be the central campus of BCC :/. but its an amazing oppurtunity and i think the pros outweigh the cons so im gona shoot for it. i never really thought i was smart enough but seeing as how im STILL in QL after all this time i think i might have some sorta brain. i hafta write this essay of why i wana do it. i been thinking about wat i wana write lately. its such a huge sacrafice to just leave and go to BCC but i think its worth it. one of the things is id be done with two years of college by the time i graduate high school. and if i get in i dont hafta take SATs or ACTs jsut this CPT test to get in and its not to big of a deal compared to the other junky standardized tests. and its totally FREE. every bit of it is free. it would be really hard in alota ways cuz theres alot id be leaving at cshs. i must say there are quite a few of u that have left ur amazing footprints on my heart and ill NEVER EVER forget u or wat uve done for me no matter where i go. so i thought id break the news.

ive been thinking alot about guys lately and ones that have come and gone and ones that are kinda just lingering. i dunno its weird. 

o yea and this stupid lil thought sits in the back of my head now. i got a stinken U on the essay we did for wilson. thats so horrible. i wanted to cry, but instead i jsut laughed about it. but now everytime i write an essay im all paranoid that its good and doesnt turn out to be a U. its like sadly added to my list of fears now.

well its the 21 of december and im really excited about christmas and christmas eve. i had the coolest dream this morning that i got this awesome solid red electric guitar. lol it was a cool dream but i dont want another guitar and i know im not getting one. it was a nice change from my ""usual"" dreams. ;)lol. 

my break has been amazing becuz it doesnt involve school or wassys stank breath. im just happy, enjoying my days. altho they have been somewhat boring and it seems im like living at the mall which is NOT my thing. nonetheless im excited all in itself. christmas eve is the big party of my wwwhhhooolllleeee family which will be quite fun and entertaining. nobody really cares but its like the day that my whole family looks forward to cuz its like the biggest get-together of the year and we all love it and all the big cooking and italianness that goes into it. 

i really hope everyone elses christmas is awesome too. time to make some phone calls so ta ta.

friday-- i babysat at 4:30 till like 11. but it was cool cuz morgan came over and we all played manhunt and basketball and all this stuff so it was fun. o yes i must include this, the lil kid matthew that we were babysitting--(hes in 2nd grade i must add)--well he threw this HUDE tanrum cuz he didnt wana go to bed and blah blah and yada yada and ended up PUNCHING ME IN THE FACE!! yea this lil chunker PUNCHED ME in the face. but his face to my reaction was priceless. i grabbed him and pushed/maybe a lil slam against the closet and i was mad of course and i said some stuff and i had a nice grip on him. i gotta tell the story in person its so much better. but anyway i freaked him out pretty good. to think about it now is very comical.

saturday-- my sister and mom were gona from like 9:30 till midnightish. and taht all in itself is just amazing. even tho i couldnt go anywhere becuz she wouldnt be able to control me, i still had a good day. played some ""community basketball"", debating going swimming, played hockey and football. then morgan felt like having a party so we tried to invite ppl but ur all stupid and busy!! so we just watched a movie and took myspace pics lol. 

today-- was fun. i just palled around my driveway being happy. then i had a lil bonding time with the padre as we put christmas lights up and discussed some things ::cough n.c. cough:: he gave me alota hope and hes sees my side of things which is cool. im realizing that my dads a good guy. 
my aunt that was pregnant lost the baby which is really sad. but thats about it.

truthfully i dont even wana go to school tomorrow. i just wana lay in my bed all day and pet my dog. ive been relating to elizabethtown alot these past weeks and really thinking about the points that were made in that awesome movie. i can only phathom the rest of wat my mind cant begin to piece together, which is almost everything. i think the best thing to do for me if u care to would be to make me smile and laugh. or just do something really random meaning like lets do something thats random but jsut becuz we can. why not u no? gosh i dunno why i feel like updating so much. i guess i really want to talk about it but i really dont. i cant describe my state cuz i dont even know. im all confused and shocked and freaked out. its so weird becuz i dont even care about my grades, for real. like i do my homework now just becuz its routine, not becuz i actually care. thats the first time ever. i always cared about my grades but suddenly the lil straight A goal means nothing. all i wana do is lay outside on the street and watch the stars with christin and ali or morgan like we did in the hurricane. or just sit and play my guitar all day. thats all i wana do."

wen i was little i played this little game with myself and the car window when it rained. i thought it was the coolest thing becuz wen it rained raindrops would fall on my window, in the car, and they would roll down the window. i would press my finger against the rolling raindrop and it would stop. it was amazing to me. i could jsut put my lil finger on the window and stop that raindrop right on its path. i told my mom about it and she tried it and she couldnt do it. my sister said she did it wen she was little. but wen i did it she was a lil bit older so it didnt always work. i tried it a few days ago and it didnt work. i realized it was becuz the magic from wen ur lil was gone. wen ur lil things are so black and white. u dont look at the raindrops and say ""nah! that cant happen. its impossible."" u say o wow look wat i did and believe it with all your heart. things are always possible and that only happens wen someones little. i realized that with each passing birthday and day that i get older, the magic dies. its really quite sad. the innocense fades away. so many more responsibilities. like wen i was little i came home and did w.e. now i come home and i have so much to worry about. i think one of the first things i started to really worry about wen i was little was that my boobs were growing and it was only third grade :/ i cant believe i said that on here but who cares. well no thats a lie, my first worry was about ppl and ""friends"". and i hate wen ppl say that they never grew up or there never gona grow up. its stupid cuz its innevitable. the only time i feel that im invincable like i kinda did wen i was little was wen i hang out with ali and christin. its all about that moment and cracking up at such stupid things, but ur bellies ache so much cuz its jsut so funny. thats wen the magic comes alive, but only for those minor seconds. but theres pros and cons to everything. if i stayed all ""magical"" and innocent all my life i would never nexperience some of the amazing things i have. this update is gona be my reminder for wenever i start to act stupid and overwhelmed. im gona read it and say stop it jazz. ur not guaranteed tomorrow so live for today and reach for the magic of today. heres an example- im not gona think of how it happened, it jsut happened. thats all i need to know. well at least for some things. 

and i have just reached a goal of mine. ive had this goal for a few years and i have now accomplished it. it doesnt really mean anything to ppl but it means alot to me. i weigh 105 pounds. im proud of myself. its kinda stupid and seems shallow i guess, but its not. 

those are my thought for today. and were not having school monday. i have decided that thats wats gona happen come monday with wilma and all. guaranteed no school monday. im gona believe that.

"event","<P>ive been wanting to write this update for a few days but just never took the time. girls wear to much make-up. its a known fact. so many ppl forget wat beauty truly is, and where it comes from. its not some powder that we cake on our faces or put on our eyes. it comes from the heart; it comes from the deep down true person where make-up doesnt exist. so many of us lose that day to day. plus wen gurls where make up they take a certain standard away from themselves. or add one, however u wana look at it. this is wat inspired all this writing. wednesday i saw a gurl in health in the gym. now i have class with her every morning, but this morning she specifically caught my eye. she kinda looked scary, and i wouldnt have really recognized her if i hadnt known her style and type of clothes she clings too. she looked like a ghost, and a skeleton all at once. im not trying to bash her and be shallow. im proving a point. she wore make up everyday, except this day. she set a standard for herself everyday of unnatural beauty thats canned and packaged. then the day that she didnt where it she looked horrible. looked like she hadnt slept all night and had a death in the family. so since she wheres all that make up everyday, she kinda has to where it everyday, or else she looks bland. its horrible. there are so many girls that u can take a butter knife and scrape off so much make up that u could use for like days to come. and dont get me wrong, im not one of those type of ppl that are all natural and that kinda&nbsp;stuff (contrary to some evidence). but i believe that make up is good and it does make u pretty but i dont where it everyday and wen i ever do i dont put alot on at all. it just makes me mad that girls where so much make up. life is to short to worry about putting make up on and impressing someone. cuz quite frankly if u have to PUT make up on to impress them, there not worth u or ur time. and with all these girls putting all that make up on it makes guys hold a higher standard as to wat girls should look like. its kinda unfair for me since i dont where make up often. call me lazy, or tom-boyish or w.e u might, but i just dont believe i should have to cake myself up to get recognition from a guy or get a new group of popular&nbsp;friends (which i have no desire at all to have). i want someone who loves me for me. u hang out with me becuz im jazz and wat u see is wat u get, and im full of suprises. and i can do all of that without make up. nobodys real anymore and it eerks me. so this is wat i have to say-- <BIG>every girl is a princess, no matter wat anyone ever says. we all start out the same and have the same potential. no matter the situation or difference of feelings. and so many girls take that away everyday by putting on all this make up and being all fake. hold a standard for yourself and believe that you are beautiful no matter wat the heck any stupid guy or girl, for that matter, says to u. be real and dont worry about impressing anyone. cuz u dont have to, ur beautiful the way u are. ppl should love us for who we are not wat we put on our faces everyday.</BIG></P>
<P><BIG>&lt;3 jazz</BIG></P>

edit-- ok this has been a common misunderstanding. im not bashing make-up itself. i like make-up, in fact im planning on wearing it to homecoming. wat i am bashing is the abuse and overuse of makeup in girls today. and yes it is their decision but im saying girls have lost so much respect to think they have to put that much makeup on everyday to be pretty. and im not saying its bad for a girl to want to look pretty. its just the irony of it all i guess. i hope that helps to better understand wat im saying."

"event","ummmm...my dog passed away today. his name was benjamin and we called him ben. he was a black lab with a white chest and lil white tips on his paws. he was cute. he lived for about 11 years. i didnt cry wen my dad took him to the vet (he was put to sleep) but i had a lump in my throat, it felt like there was a coconut in my stomach, and ten pounds hanging from my heart. my heart still feels heavy even tho its been a few hours. i couldnt go this time. i went to the vet a couple years ago wen we put christy to sleep and i couldnt bring myself to do it again with ben. my dad was upset wen he got home, i looked at him and i saw it in his eyes and face. he was crying. hes sad obviously becuz he had to put ben down and he loved him but also i think becuz wen we first got ben, gosh it was so long ago. we were all so young. and now its like his life has been lived and it was his time. it was for the best and i think my dad feels that its like the end of his youth somewhat. were all getting older and we cant stop time. kinda like a reality check. it was for the best tho. bens knees, hips, and back was shot and we found out he had a huge tomber is his spleen. hes been on serious pain killers since about six months ago and lately hes been in agony unless he has his meds. and wen he had his meds there were so strong that he was ""high flyin"". so to keep him alive any longer would have been sorta cruel cuz he'd be stoned all the time. its hard to let go, even if i wasnt to close with him. hes still one of my dogs and its really sad. 

but i realized that we all go thro our lives and were all gona die. and we think were invincible sometimes but were not. alot of times we waste our lives and dont realize how special it really is to live. we never appreciate the small things cuz were to busy spending half our lives on gossip and tv, and stinken hw. i wish we could just live our lives with our eyes wide open and bare footed but man is it hard. this world is so fast paced. everything has to be written in stone and everyone has way to many plans for the future and forgets about the here and now. the fact that u woke up today and could walk and it didnt hurt one bit. dogs are so simple and they only want one thing for u, and they require it in such a simple fashion. we are so much different. half the world acts like idiots, and i bet ya wen they look back on there lives, there not happy. cuz wen we look back we only wana remember the happy, good things. we live for experiences, we live for the choices, we live for the love and relationships. and i wish we wouldnt get lost in suck junk all the time. this world isnt for me. its to fast-paced. im pretty simple and things like today make me even simpler. im glad i have elliot. im not obsessed with him. ive just recognized the simple joy he brings me and truly cherish him. and gosh thats alot more than i can say for some ppl today. and im not directing that at any of u so dont take offense. regardless of anything else, death is always hard.

my birthday is october 4. and i will be 15. yes, im gona be 15, lets not all act shocked now. if ur curious i skipped kindergarten...woopdy doo. lets all get over it. but we have off that day cuz its a jewish holiday...woo hoo. so im going to islands of adventure with family (dunno if my dads coming) and my madre said i could bring someone. oooOOOOoooo...ive been examining haha jk jk. i think im gona ask christin...the one me and ali always go to the walk with. im not having a party or nothing like that tho. i find it depressing throwing a party for my birthday. i dunno why but i dont like it. id rather it just be like ppl calling and wishing me a happy bday and thats it. i hate inviting ppl and thinking of ppl to invite and this and that. ive always wanted a suprise bday cuz then i wouldnt have to do nothing. but my mom would never throw me one so, to busy and stuff. plus she wouldnt no wat to do or who to invite. haha that would be kinda funny. her going thro my fone and calling ppl. wat a thought. ill still have the best birthday going to islands. i think my parents feel bad for me tho around my bday cuz alis bday comes first and she usually gets this awesome party, but then by time my bday comes its like no money left...or so the joke goes. so i think she decided this would be nice for my 15th.
wat a pointless update. i dunno why i update. i feel like deleting all this, but i wont."

"event","i dunno why im updating but i just feel like it. so much has been going on lately. like my life has been pretty packed and stressful. swimming is to say the least really hard. trying to have straight A's seems close to impossible and the pressure keeps building for so many things.

my sisters birthday is sunday and shes gona be 18...wow. wen did we all get so old, how did we grow up so fast. it seems wen u want time to stop it laughs and spits right in ur face and tears and ticks faster. shes having a really cool party down by the beach and im really excited for her and the party. theres something soo totally awesome thats gona happen. its a suprise for her so im not gona put it on here. maybe later. im really excited about it tho. its like wen i stop and think about what im still doing here, theres two ppl that come to my mind most becuz at the end of the day, they keep me alive. that would be my sister and the suprise. woops lets hope she doesnt read that cuz thats a dead givaway.

yea me and ali were talking the other day about the stress my mom puts on us and how strict she really is. out of all her siblings shes the most like her mother and she wont ever admit it. thats her downfall. and my grandmother is great but shes just wow. u can only spend a couple days with her till u lose control and jsut scream at her cuz shes a pain in the ass. so controlling. thats my mom. shes pretty selfish and it affects me and my siss. like i had alota hw and i didnt even eat dinner that night but i still had to do all the dishes. i ended up going to bed at like 1 and wat pissed me off most was she could like care less. she could have done it, she wasnt working the next day. she feels we owe it all to her. i hate that type of attitude. she is a big cause for my shields and walls. i love her and shes an amazing woman but shes impossible. its like everything has to be on her time. and i have to be so perfect for my parents all the time. i have to be just like ali. god i hate that. and once i finish high school we're moving to north carolina. she wants to move sooner but i refused to leave my home town and my high school for her selfish wishes. i like it up there but its just not me and i dont want it. but i have to comply. sometimes i wish i would just lose complete control and freak out so she would get mad and send me to military school. to get outa here and this place and stress and pressures. that would be somewhat of a dream come true. im just gona focus on this weekend cuz its gona be so happy for me. thats all i wana think about. 

i was talking today to someone. we kinda started discussing alcohol. i thought about it and was like wow. how good would taht really feel to jsut get really drunk and feel like u have nothing to worry about, no problems for that moment. like wen im hyper, i get insane and so happy. i was like wow if thats just hyper imagine being drunk. im glad we dont have school. i dont have to scramble for stupid teachers.

see ya."

"event","i want opinions on this topic, please.

why do we have dreams? are they a way of experiencing the future, or reliving the past? how bout teaching us a lesson that we may have forgotten? are they a way of experiencing something that perhaps our mind knows will never happen, so we experience it in our mind to know what it feels like? its a deep subject, books were written about it, doctors studied it since way back. but no answers that are certain? we all have them. if its all really in our minds then why can we sometimes feel, taste, smell, touch, and see in our dreams? and if its only in our minds why do we wake up sweaty sometimes if were under some kinda stress in the dream? why sometimes then do we not wake up sweaty? is it our way of escaping reality and the physical world and going somewhere kinda like neverland? if so, why do we have bad dreams and nightmares? captain hook was killed a long time ago. if we can experience our dreams so well then why sometimes cant we remember them, and other times we can say word for word exactly what happened? and if its all in our heads then why do we dream things that are off the wall and crazy, things we would never even dream of thinking or doing? or is it all your thoughts throughout the day coming together when ur most relaxed and settled and the thoughts put together to make an experience for u? why do we have dreams about phobia's and things that we fear or that hurt the most? and most of all, we never really see the people's faces but we know exactly who they are beyond a shadow of a doubt? 

i dont believe there are any real answers or solutions to these questions, but i do think people have good thoughts on it."

she said ""i thought about u cuz im rooming with this 'emo' girl so i thought i'd tell u. ur so right i get stuck with all these quiet ppl, jazz ur my best friend. i miss you and i thought of u. this gurl is always being separate and quiet."" we had a lil chuckle and aww moment.

my sister is nice so nerdy ppl hang on to her and she suffers cuz she feels bad for them. i tell her all the time, and now shes realized it. it was nice to be woken up and hear her voice and her saying that. shes so awesome. i lov her.

i had a really good time. its good to just getaway sometimes. its really pretty over there and people are just so much nicer then here. i wanted to stay longer. only bad part was i didnt have my elliot. nonetheless i was really happy over there and wasnt in the mood and didnt care to call anyone or nothing so. i also did alot of thinking and stuff and learned some lessons that are very valuable. one would be that everything i need is right here for me and i dont have to go searching for nothing or no one. it puts a smile on my face just knowing that. i just never realized it before.

my sister is leaving tomorrow to go to miami for this CSI thing and shes gona be gone for another 10 days. so i will be unico hija for a while. my moms not working as much either so its all gona work out well. o yea... i got electricuted--omgsh it was awesome. technically it happened twice but the first time was barely so. my arm felt all jello-y after and the rest of the day. thats somthing that happened that was worthy of telling. very worthy.

its a nice three day weekend but im really sick so it stinks. got to leave early friday cuz of it tho so, theres a plus there. finals next week and im procrastinating studying as usual. 

goin to a graduation party later and i realized while i was mopping that this is it for seniors. and everyone is moving up. which means my siss will be a senior. i thought about that and i realized i dont know what i would do without her, really, shes like my concsience. we fight and i am really mean to her accidentally but deep down i wouldnt be half the person i am today without her. i never thought i'd see the day that she'd be leaving and going off to college. ill be calling her like every day. it makes me all teary eyed to think of this. im gona be crying so much wen she graduates. not only is she my sister, but shes my best friend and gosh shes always there even wen its 2 and i cant sleep and shes sleeping. i can always count on my siss. she keeps me level-headed. i look up to her so much and wen she leaves im going to be really sad. and if you ever read this ali, i love u so much sista. thanx for everything, and dealing with me. holding me, loving me, and wiping my tears wen no one else would. you are my al, hulk, white rice, face, clowny, bobs, and loving sister. u keep me laughing and can always get a smile outa me. <3

i dont really no wat happened but i lost a good friendship this past week. w.e. im going out to dinner tonight, im really excited cuz its thai and its gona be good. i really havent been feeling good tho so i hope my stomach takes it well. i been waking up wit bad stomach aches and i dont eat much for breakfast or lunch. im not anorexic tho. im just not hungry. and i have a really bad feeling in my chest of anxiety, i wish it would all go away tho, my stomach can usually handle anything and this lil chest feeling is annoying and makes me nervous, not cuz of the actual thing ,but cuz of anxiety? if that makes sense at all. and i randomly see stars, literally lil lights, they look like lil stars appearing anywhere around my head and then they fade away. and i havent been sleeping well,i cant fall asleep and wen i do i have really weird dreams and it seems as tho im awake the whole time that im sleeping i dunno. i guess im not but i wake up easily. i dunno im just confused. been listenin to bright eyes nonstop tho. good stuff.

Numb...
I'm tired of being what you want me to be, Feeling so faithless Lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me, Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

I've Become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired, So much more aware
I'm becoming this, All I want to do
Is be more like me And be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, Afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is Another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste Is more than I can take

And I know, I may end up failing too
But I know,You were just like me
With someone disappointed in you"

"event","becuz of the circumstances ive been in this past week i did some thinkin with all my spare time and with being influenced by some emotions ive come to a conclusion that i think is smart wen u think about it...

life isnt pointless. it really is quite meaningful. the things taht we spend all are time thinkin about, the lil petty things, that really wont matter in 5 years, those are the pointless things. yet we dwell on them so much. we live our lives by such a schedule that we fall into this routine and forget to experience life. we never do anything out of the ordinary and its not like we do all this on purpose we just dont think about it. we let the littlest, stupidest things upset us. i guess its a part of growing up and maturing. its all really about our choices. and i was thinkin about gettin rid of my LJ but i dunno, im not gona. but since my updates are gona be like every 2 weeks, i decided to at least make a few worth reading and not just the usual wat happened during the week. that would be dum cuz most of the ppl that read about it, most likely were right there or already know about it so. 

and since all these ppl over the past few months have been asking wat ppl think about them or somthin to that affect, i think ill do that same....wat was your first thought wen u met me and wat do u think of me now, be honest, ive been called some colorful things so trust me, im not gona like get mad or nothin. OR jsut do the popular 4 question thing...and ill answer them 100% honestly.

sunday went to church, hadnt been to church in a while so we tried a new one. it was good, the pastor and visiting rabbi had good jokes and it was cool. then went to a friends bday party and becuz of some things like beer and pot the party was relocated to deerfield beach. honestly i didnt wana go all the way down to deerfield beach but i wanted to kinda support ma friend and she was already upset about the whole scene so we jsut went down there for her. i really wasnt comfortable and the beach was extremely crowded and i just wanted to go home but w.e. we werent there long so. 

tonight was very reflective tho. i dunno if its a good thing. its supposed to be.

well jazz didnt attend matthew's bday party cuz she attended a BETTER one...ya right. i went to a concert and i saw shayna's parents there. i went wit ma fam and my uncle/brother juan. we went to see Mannhemm Steamroller. the first half was really good. i luv watching other musicians play and do there thing. its inspiring for me, it makes me wana practice even more and work harder to be where there at. anywho so the second half was really boring and the music was like soothing or somthin and put me to sleep lol. i took quite a nap. u could call it mas o menos, mas for the first half, menos for the second. 
well later on at home we watched a show about transexuals and how there having sexual gender construction. wow...now every time i look at a man or woman i hav the thought in the back of my head if there really wat they appear to be, hhmmm? weird stuff. the sucky part was that all the guys that felt they were supposed to be woman, were hott. 
then we put on The Grudge and i dont think i even watched ten min of it before i decided...def not. i have heard things before and ma siss and mom have seen some things so i really dont need that movie in my head. lol i guess u can call that a chicken butt! i dont care man, i dont want no nightmares. 
then while i was taking a shower i realized how ma belly button used to be a cute lil outie nd now its an innie. then i realized that i need some medicine for my thumb cuz i hav like a corn on it or somthin lol. so i made it bleed, pretty bad too. lol ok ima go back to the living room and see how much i can take of the grudge? hhmmm im betting like 3 min tops. tootles guys. and i did think of u all and wat i was missing at matts party, but im glad i went to the concert. mwaz

"event","i honestly thought by the end of today i was gona end up with no friends except becci and sean. this has been one of the worst days and april fools ive ever had. my april fools hav never happened like this, and ive had alot and ive used the whole military thing before. for those of u that dont exactly know wat happened or didnt get the whole story...well it went somthing like this.

yesterday in PE me, becci, and sean were talking about how we had to do somthing to ppl, for sean it was kristen that he was pranking. well sean decided he would tell kristen he was moving and since i had a fight wit ma mom wednesday it was perfect to say last night that im goin to military skool and all this stuff. well bridget had been mad at me so i couldnt tell her cuz we werent talkin, everyone else new about it, so nikki and kristen were left. well it has never got this big and bad before. to nikki and kristen im really sorry. i didnt mean to hurt u guys or w.e else happened. ok so from last night to today i had nikki and kristen crying and sean added on top of it, for kristen today, to mine last night about him moving. well needless to say there was a whole lot of crying today. i realized how emotional ppl really get and my lil joke wasnt all that lil. anywho nikki found out in first hour and i thought she new but not from the way she found out. and kristen didnt find mine or seans jokes funny. i thought she new that mine was a joke wen she found out about seans but she didnt. so i told her and i guess she was relieved but mad. around lunch time me, nikki, and kristen started crying and i straightened things out wit bridge, and im really happy about that cuz it was really bugging me. we kinda hurt eachother and bridget was mad at me for wat i did and i was mad at her for totally ignoring and avoiding me but were good now. well i told kris and nikki at lunch time mine was a joke (even tho nikki new) and i honestly thought that they were gona be really mad. well kristen decided to get back at sean so she said she was gona break up with him and i even felt that one. i felt it was partly my fault and me and sean were pretty upset by lunchtime, alongside of kristen. all i gota say is im really glad all that is over and i hav really learned my lesson with my practical joking...u cant mess wit ppl and there emotions like that, especially wat me and sean did. im really sorry guys. u too bridge. but that doesnt mean im done with my pranks, just im gona losen up some wit em. o yea and i want to tell u all somthing: for the many years that i hav been pranking ppl on april fools and other days ive been waiting for someone to come along and give me a prank as bad as mine are or worse and really get me good, but no success yet. so i give all of u my permission (even tho u dont really care bout it) to get into the planning stage and prank me good...i really want u too lol.

i luv u all soooo much 
<3 <3 Jazz

p.s. just so u all no me and sean both had some really really bad anxiety attacks about our lil jokes cuz we realized just how bad they had gotten. we were sorry from first hour on. we couldnt breath, were shaking, drinking lots of water, and couldnt concentrate cuz it was on our minds."

"event","well i dont really feel like saying much but just to update. i got grounded during spring break on tuesday night i think. so therefor it sucked completely nd utterly no way to explain how much it sucked tush. lost ma laptop nd wasnt allowed to do anythin nd had to be under ma moms wing all the time so she could watch me. wen monday came i was like nervous bout skool, it was like going to skool on the first day u no. like i hadnt seen anyone nd it seemed like forever nd i wasnt sure if things were changed or wat? 

today in PE- we played ""gould ball"" nd we were playing with wooden raquets. weeeelllllllll.......since we all know how cordinated becci is lol. she was attempting to hit the ball nd instead totally missed the ball nd hit her face. it was one of those moments where u look at that person nd just start laughin nd say, ""wow"" well i went over concerned thro my laughter nd said are u ok nd i hear ""O MY EYE!"" so we established her eye was still in the socket nd then a lump on becci's forehead formed. very funny.

spring break 2005 is now over. nd i am finished updating.

*edit* ok so ma mom tells me the other day that ma dad wants me to take anger management class's. WTH! yea i didnt no wat to think. i really felt like laughin at her but i didnt wana get grounded again for being rude. she said it was becuz of the other night wen they thought i was ""abducted"" wen really i just went for a walk cuz i was extremely upset nd angry. apparently he said theres something wrong becuz a gurl my age shouldnt have anger like that?? w.e. i aint taking no anger management classes"

"event","well this spring break has been pretty boring...dunno y but i find myself walkin around ma house nd hav a burning desire to play cards nd somehow kinda wanting to clean?? :/ well heres wat ive done, very interesting of course....

friday- went to the beach wit ali nd christin. we spent like 40 min driving around so i put a british accent on nd entertained them. then we finally found a place to park nd went swimming nd i read the notebook to them [tear]

saturday-woke up with a huge craving for general tso's chicken EXTRA SPICY! made mac nd cheese for breakfast lol MMmmm. ma uncle/brother came over nd we went shopping for easter eggs lol nd then came home nd played x-box nd i got ma general tso's chicken!! wooo it was good 

sunday-i woke up nd really wanted to play cards nd was determined to play playstation nd actually get somwhere on a game...i didnt. then i decided i wanted to work out so i went for a run wit elliot then went home cuz i changed ma mind bout running lol. so i went outside wit the four dogs nd played around (no bridget we didnt play tackle football!) then i gave them baths nd went bowling wit ali, bridget, sean, james, mike dough.,mike dean, paul, katie, umm i think thats it. made some prank calls nd went home.

monday-made pancakes for breakfast. yum!then me nd ali went to hang wit ma aunt in boca. we went shopping...how original. i realized tho while we were at target how much i really dont like shopping, really i hate it. nd the only reason i do go is for social reasons nd to eat out lol. seriously i bring money but not to buy something its for food. i get really bored nd delirious and sarcastic too. like ill start talkin in accents nd runnin thro isles nd just being really dum and all these lil gurls jsut stare at me so i think its funny nd do it more. then u get the snobs who think somehow they got somthin on me cuz there wearing abercrombie nd im not! dude like i care! so they stare at me so then i just act really dum...i think part of the reason they stare at me is cuz they've never seen a real life midget!!! OMGSH!! stupid ppl, i dont tolerate snobby brats who are like that. they care so much about how they look...they miss out on life. nd they no im not so they stare at me! HAHAHAHAAA!!! losers.

its funny how we are all so like dum wen a few people go out of town. lol i thought ma spring break was gona be like so dude mang fun! but its really not. pathetic. stay tuned for tomorrows episode of wat happens today!!! YAY!! this is the sarcasm im talkin about...its comes with a severe case of boredom

Yes, I am supposed to be studying for a final, but I am extremely bored and don't want to do it. Thus I am packing everything away. But there is only so much to pack and I don't have any boxes to put things in just yet. So until then I will sort things and how they should be packed in said boxes. After I'm done with that, then what do I do? I suppose I should study...


...NAH!!! I'd rather be doing this! :-P"

:)

My brother Matt used to date this girl named Ruth Ellen, and they dated about a year before they broke up and became just friends. Well he'd date somebody and it wouldn't work out, then she'd date somebody and it wouldn't work out, but all the while they were still friends and would occasionally go to lunch or meet for dinner or something ""friendly"". Well, Ruth Ellen up and decides that she's gonna apply to work at the same emergency room Matt works at in Arlington. (hmm...) And it just so happens that shortly after she got the job there, Matt broke up with the girl he had been dating, and Ruth Ellen broke up with the guy she had been dating. (Hmm...) Yet, Matt insisted they were not going out. (hahaha) A few days before Christmas, Mom called Matt and wanted to know if he wanted to do lunch together. Just so happened that Ruth Ellen was with him to help him shop for gifts so all four of us ended up eating lunch together. Still, Mom asked Matt if they were dating and he said no. (whatever...) Mom invited him over to the house for presents on Christmas Eve and he said he couldn't come but declined to say why. Turns out he went to a Christmas Eve service at the church that Ruth Ellen was raised in, and then went over to her mom's house. I can't remember when but a few days after Christmas he and Ruth Ellen finally fessed up to everybody that they were dating. (DUH!!! Everyone was guessing it and could read it all over them, however no one but Matt and Ruth Ellen know exactly how long they've been back together) Anywho, on Jan 7th Matt told mom and I that he had bought a ring for Ruth Ellen and that as soon as he asked for her mom's blessing that he was gonna propose! AWW!!!!! My mom was never so happy to hear that, because she REALLY REALLY REALLY liked Ruth Ellen and was mad at Matt when they broke up. Needless to say he had dinner with her mother, and she approves, so Matt will be proposing probably this Thursday from what I hear. I'm gonna have a new sister-in-law! And Mandy and Shari are gonna have another aunt who is a year older than them! Hahahaha!!! They are so cute together! It's like a carbon copy of my mom and dad, because Matt is a paramedic who wants to try out for the fire department (dad was a firefighter), and Ruth Ellen is in school to become a nurse (mom is a nurse). HAPPY! HAPPY! JOY! JOY! HAPPY! HAPPY! JOY! JOY!"

"event","Well, I already had the beginnings of a cold before I went home, but by the time I hit the front door of the house it was a full blown put-me-in-bed cold. Thursday mom and I cooked and took food to the Elkins' house for Thanksgiving lunch. It was okay, I suppose. Everyone was on their ""best"" behavior whether it was genuine or not. Talked to my brother Dave in CT, which kinda suprised me because he had been out shoveling snow earlier in the day so I thought he would be tired, but he always calls :-D. Friday was laundry day and the A&M/UT game. Yes, the Aggies lost once again. However, it was not a total blowout as in years past, and the fact that news articles said the Longhorns ""escaped"" from College Station gave me confidence in Steven McGee and the Aggies next season. Saturday I was really, really sick. I got my hair cut and tried doing homework while mom got her hair done, but it just didn't work. We zipped over to Wal-Mart where she got me some medicine and then went to Sams where she got me some more medicine, and then went home. Church on Sunday was good. I packed last night and we drove in this morning. I kinda ""skipped"" my first class, meaning that I didn't attend lecture but I turned my homework in at the end. Dr. Hurlebaus handed me my test and I got a 101!! YAY!!! I kicked it's bee-hind. So now I'm here, writing on my livejournal and hacking up my lungs when I should be doing linear algebra. Pooh. Later y'all."

"event","i had to get signatures from some professors today. one of them i had already met but needed to get a second signature because he was the faculty sponsor. he was joking around trying to give me a hard time, so in truly bad melissa fashion i apologized for not having him sign it before. he just gave me this big smile and told me not to apologize because he should've seen it. another professor i called ""dr"" said he would sign my paper if i agreed to call him ""tim"" and not ""dr"" in the future. dr beason was my final signature. he came around the corner and saw me standing outside his office and said ""well, i suppose you're wanting to buy a signature or something?"", so i said yes and gave him a pen...only the pen fell apart! he was like ""wait a minute. what kind of pen did you give me? you gave me a defective pen!"" and i was like ""yeah, that's bad for an engineering student."" so after he put my pen back together he said ""i'll sign your paper if you can answer this question: what is your acceleration right now?"" ""ZERO!!!"" ""Very good."" ""Yay! I learned something in ENGR 221!"" ( He was my prof for that class :-) ) so i now have all of my signatures, save for two pledges who i probably won't need their signatures anyway. 

got a flu shot. so should you. i called about getting one and they tried to make me wait until the flu shot campaign in like 2 weeks, and i was like ""no, i want it now"". so i got it. and it made me feel like crap for the first two days. i'm still tired but feeling a little better. i'm glad i didn't wait because i was reading the little sheet they gave me and it says that it takes 2 weeks for protection to develop after getting the shot, which means i could've potentially gotten really sick during finals if i had waited longer. go melissa!

other random things: 
1) Thanksgiving dinner at the Elkins house is probably gonna suck if Gina and Brad show up. I am so tired of the drama they cause.  
2) Haven't seen much of the roommate, which really doesn't bother me because then I can set the thermostat how I want and I can go to bed early. She hasn't been here the past three nights, but hey that's college. Only thing that bugs me is that I had to move her crap in and out of the bathroom when Deloris came to clean. If that stuff isn't moved, she won't clean, so I basically had to. 
3) CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THANKSGIVING BREAK!!!!! The day I go home I have to register for spring classes, so that should be fun. Mom wanted me to come home on Tuesday, and not that I don't want to come home Tuesday, it's just that the dorms have high speed internet, which is the shiznit for registering for classes. I couldn't imagine trying to register with dial-up internet. ugh ::shutters:: but yeah, the break is gonna be cool because i can wake up early on Thanksgiving to all the parades, then start cooking once those are over. I love cooking my Dad's cornbread dressing. He started teaching me to cook that when I was about 9, so by the time he died I had it down. And it's all in my head, too. He never had anything written down, so I never wrote anything down and just put everything to memory. Oh sure, I wrote down the recipe that first Thanksgiving after he died, but I haven't looked at it since. Good stuff like that really makes Thanksgiving for me.

Saw this commercial the other day that was trying to be politically correct about the holidays: 

Happy Merry Christmahanukwanzakah!

Please join with me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community. This Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and trauma complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71. Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high with flours. Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he was still a crusty old man and was considered a roll model for millions. Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough, two children: John Dough and Jane Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly dad, Pop Tart. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes."

"event","so the astros lost really bad. did you hear that? it was the whole state of texas sighing. yep. pretty bad.

i have been riding an emotional rollercoaster all week and last night it dropped me off in a dark dimension of hell. to recap:

Monday: Mom and I drove back from Fort Worth at about 8AM. I went to class and got a 90 on my diseases quiz. Later that night Leslie and I went to the Chi Epsilon social at Gattitown (which I never believed people but it is a huge waste of money), got 29/36 signatures for my pledge sheet, and back to campus to work on homework. 

Tuesday: Homework crapily done and turned in at 8AM. More studying and work for the quiz at 12:45. Walked into math class and our professor told us we would never get a degree from Texas A&M if we continued to not do homework, not look at the class notes, and perform on the quizzes like we did. For the record: I do the homework, I look at the notes, and the 50 i got on the quiz he handed back is gonna get thrown out because it is one of my two lowest grades. The only good part about today was that our geology class got out at 2:55 instead of 3:35 because some folks needed our lecture hall for something. yay! went to the dorm to work on structures homework which turned out to be the biggest-freaking-bear of a homework i've ever done. Hall picture a 7PM, at which I smacked our RHA delegate with his own shoe because he was being an ass.

Wednesday: Got up at 7AM to do structures homework due at 11:30. Worked on it for 4 hours with only 5/7 problems done and none of them correct. Daniel called me and told me that the homework was due on Friday (YAY!!!) so I stopped fretting about it and started studying for my geology lab midterm. I studied my notes and went in to study the rocks about an hour before the test. With about 20 minutes to go, 4 other people came in so i got to study rocks with them too. We got the test at 3:05 and I walked out of the building at 3:25. Yeah, I was prepared. The last person to leave was a senior in the corps who left at 4:45. Hahahaha...shoulda studied the rocks, my boy. (i know that's callus, but i will explain later) After I got out I called mom and she told me that Pearl passed away. I started looking for plane tickets and rental cars for her.

Thursday: Math test at 8AM. I thought I did really well. Went to the SCC to book mom a plane ticket and this girl at the computer across from me kept cutting me these mean looks because I was talking on the phone. Finally I just stared at her and she finally looked away. Man, if you wanna study, go to the library. Don't go somewhere where you are allowed to talk on the cell phone. If she had said something I'm pretty sure I would've verbally gone off on her. Went to my other math class and found out I got a 75 on the quiz because I had done it EXACTLY as the professor had written it on the board, and I tried showing it to him and he was like ""No, I would never do that. I would never write that on the board. I didn't write that on the board. I don't know what you thought I wrote, but I didn't write that."" He's just a crochety old man so there's no use arguing with him. I still have a B in the class. I came back to the dorm to find that I made 65 on the 8AM test. 65. WTFN?? I thought I knew the stuff, but obviously not. I called mom and almost cried because of my two ""bad"" grades (even though they are both passing) and because I was so tired that I didn't want to finish my homework. Here, I entered the land I like to call I-DON'T-GIVE-A-SHIT and just took on this laid back attitude that the world could just pass me by and i'd sit there in my lounge chair with a margarita in my hand and Kenny Chesney playing in the background. Yeah, I really stopped caring last night. Anywho, got mom's plane ticket to Minneapolis bought, got her rental car reserved, and she got her hotel room in Iowa Falls. Afterward, I slept. Oh yes, I slept very well.

Friday: Got up early to finish my homework and, glory be, I actually solved one of the two problems I needed to do CORRECTLY!!! That was payment in itself. The other six are wrong, but just to know that I got that one right makes me happy. Mom called at about 9:30 from the airport to tell me she didn't have the confirmation for her car so I fed it to her over the phone and then told her how to get to the rental car place in MSP. Stupid Matt was supposed to print of both the e-ticket and her car information, but he only printed out the e-ticket. anywho. It's 1:33 so mom should be getting her car by now and should soon be on the way to Iowa. Why Minneapolis? well, it was $900 cheaper than Des Moines. that's why. and we couldn't have gotten a special rate because mom isn't related to Pearl. tonight i signed up to help out with this scholarship banquet to which mom keeps asking ""why aren't you in it? you have a scholarship!"", and I always reply ""yes, mom. but i don't have a new scholarship."" afterward I intend on passing out in my bed and waking up shortly before kick-off tomorrow at 2:30. Just kidding. I'll get up before noon, I'm sure. How funny it is that I'm from Texas, mom is from Iowa, and we will be in our respective birth states when Texas A&M plays Iowa State tomorrow. She should just tell people she is an Aggie mom that was trying to get to the game and got lost. No, just kidding...never mind!"

"event","the geology field trip was fun but it was such a load of crap. i mean, he spit out so much information at us that there is no way we could retain it all or even apply it all. i did get to meet a lot of cool, very fun, very nice people. a guy even pulled my chair out for me at the restaraunt we went to in marble falls. hahaha! that's definately a first.

though something happened that we all thought was hilarious and the prof will probably think is hilarious later on. he had prided himself that in 95 trips he'd only had one kid arrested. well, we had one kid arrested and two others that didn't show up on the bus on sunday morning. the two who weren't arrested assured us that they would meet us later on down at the riverwalk for lunch, which they did. meanwhile, we were on the riverboats just sailing around and we all looked up and saw chris, the jailbird, standing up on a bridge trying to call one of his friends on our boat. it was so funny! we were waving at him and he didn't realize it was us. hahahaha!

the day after we got back i had a quiz, which i knew would be easy, and a test, which i was told would be hard. all of us were told the test would be impossible so hardly anyone studied on the trip, but we all studied our butts off all day monday. i'm happy to say that i got a 90 on both the quiz and the test. hellagood. 

now i've got to concentrate on a project due next wednesday in which we get to design a truss for a building and test it against other trusses. i picked this guy named daniel to be my teammate, and early on i thought he was gonna be just another teammate that doesn't do anything. little did i know that he has actually had this class before and did the same project the last time he had the class. BOOYA! i feel so gifted right now. he knew how to enter stuff into this program and showed me so that i could do it on my own, and i was like ""you are a really good teammate. you just don't understand the crap i've been through with teammates."" and he just kinda sat there and smiled. lol

Went to Midnight Yell last night with 3 New Orleans students from our dorm who had never been to yell before. It was fun explaining some stuff to them, but it was really fun to see the expressions on their faces when stuff actually happened, like the canon going off or every class doing their wildcat. It was pretty fun. The game was ok in that we won, but it was so hot and tiring that I left in the 3rd quarter. Whoohoo. I have no voice either. We played Baylor, so I'll just blame them for everything: Stupid Baylor Bears!

I feel things are going to go a lot better in the dorm pretty soon. Trenelle and I are going to take over the Hall Council meeting on Monday (our president gave us the ok) and we're gonna work on actually scheduling programs and showing folks how to fill out an event planner or program planner so they can start planning stuff themselves. yay! And I think I showed our GHD that the Hall Council isn't totally stupid or incapable (atleast myself). She came by asking for our transactions through the university and I had everything copied, stapled, and registered like a checkbook. She made copies of everything and then returned the folder with a card inside thanking me for being on top of everything and making her life easier. Score one for me! Now, if I can only get our former president, Dr. Bowen, to come to our dorm I think I would get major cool points. LOL!

Anywho, lots to do. TTYL!!! LOVE Y'ALL!!!"

Step 2: Pick your favorite lines from the first 20 songs that play.
Step 3: Post and let everyone you know guess what song & artist the lines come from without cheating.

1) Maybe some other time, I can't slow down. Right across that state line, right about now.

2) And I still want her, (echo ->) and I still need him so. Oh I don't know why we let each other go.

3) Hell I was down there in an hour or so, with a little mouth to mouth she was ready to go!

4) Oh how it feels so real, lying here with no one near, and only you and you can hear me when i sing softly, slowly...

5) If I could only touch your cheek, maybe that's all I'd need to make my life complete.

6) I learned that happiness on earth ain't just for high achievers

7) Guess who's the new talk of the town, the new S.O.B.?

8) She ran off with that boy to Cancun.

9) I wanna wake up to the day your memory won't stand in my way.

10) She woke in the morning. She knew that her life had passed her by.

11) I know something is coming. I don't know what it is, but I know it's amazing, can save me. My time is coming. 

12) Will I stand in your presence or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all?

13) Put my bike out on the highway. Feel that wind all in my face. Breathe some air that tastes like freedom, let that be my saving grace.

14) But I'm here to let you know that you can make it through if you believe that someone's watchin' over you.

15) Hullabaloo, Caneck, Caneck! Hullabaloo, Caneck, Caneck! Goodbye to texas university... (hahaha!)

16) Here's a toast to you on the coast and the sailors out at sea...

17) What they say, what they know, what they think won't ever bring me down. This life is mine and I am my own.

18) I barely remember falling asleep, but the minute I open my eyes every dream comes true when I look at you...

19) Look for the girl with the broken smile and ask her if she wants to stay a while

20) I've got two plane tickets and a ring. There it is, I've told you everything."

saturday i got up early to go to our football game at 11:30. it was a good game. a very good game. at the half we were beating SMU 24-8, and in the beginning of the 3rd quarter i felt it was time for me to leave otherwise i would be a lobster. on the way out we scored another touchdown and the aggies scored another when i was getting food. the final score ended up being A&M's welcome back to aggieland moment for SMU: a 66-8 shilacking by the aggies on the ponies. hahahahahaha! was the sunburn worth it? i'll get back to you on that. but yeah, i turned into a half baked lobster anyway. the part i hate most about it is that it's only on one side of my face and neck and i've got a line from where my sunglasses were. ack!

after i got back i did homework. yes, homework. then i slept. then i woke up this morning, watched the race and did more homework at the same time. my roomie came back and asked me if i was studying for a test or just working. yeah, just working. then i watched lots of tv. right now i'm going between lord of the rings 2, pearl harbor, the emmys, and gactv. i'm such a bum right now. and deservedly so, because i don't feel like working anymore or going anywhere. maybe i'll feel better by tomorrow.

mmmmmmm, i smell popcorn! i'm such a tv junkie right now."

"event","hello all! oh how i'm glad that i'm finally back at the dorm, only to leave again in about an hour. the day so far was your typical day at college: both classes were long and boring but i somehow managed to stay awake. Walking to my first class two seniors in the Corps passed me and one of them almost bit it walking on that slick floor in the Commons, like seriously scared me that i was gonna have a boot mark in my face from this guy flipping over backwards. lol, that woulda looked cute for my meetings! later on when i went to get my bus for the vet campus I got on the right route but the wrong end of it, so we went all the way over to the baseball field and back to the MSC before finally making it to my stop. Last week it took me 12 minutes from getting on the bus at fish pond to sitting in my seat in class. Today it took me 32 minutes from getting on the bus until sitting in a seat. yeah, that sucked. but atleast i got the right bus on the way back!! now i must go eat before my RHA and general hall meetings tonight. then homework? sleep afterward?? hopefully..."

"event","so it looks like i'll be going home early this weekend to get my permit and hopefully get my computer fixed. i suppose that's a double yay? for some reason my internet explorer decided to crap out on me. pooh!

i'm excited about all the RHA/PES/NSCS stuff i've got coming up. it just dawned on me last week that i'm in all these groups but RHA is the only one i actually do stuff in, mostly hall council. so including ASCE i'll be going to a lot of meetings and having a lot more fun.

can't wait for football season to start in aggieland! hopefully our boys won't get crapped on by the refs at kyle field like they did at clemson. the 12th man will definately have something to say about it should it happen. speaking of, what is this crap of trying to move the A&M/Tech game to dallas? i don't want to go to dallas to see that game! it needs to stay at kyle, that's all i have to say. 

tomorrow: updates on my classes and both of my meetings. yay!"

"event","i took the armrests off my office chair so that it would fit all the way under the desk and wouldn't stick out in the walkway. yeah, i forgot about it and damn near landed on my face when i leaned over to get a kleenex. way to go aggie! thank you, thank you, i'll be here all week. :-P

oh, and another crazy thing i saw. mom and i went to sams today, and you know those handicap spaces that people are supposed to park lengthwise in, like parallel parking, and not like the regular spaces? three cars were pulled into the parallel spots just like a regular parking spot. no kidding! and then it hit me that i was really back in aggieland again. hehehe!"

Yeah, so we had Big Event at my school today. Wow, am I tired. Jenna, Jonathan, Patricia and I went to a lady's house in Bryan who said that she needed her leaves raked up. OMG...I have never seen so many leaves in one place before, especially for a trailer park yard. You know those big black garbage bags that hold an insane amount of stuff, like 30 gallons or so? We filled up 43 of those suckers. 43 GARBAGE BAGS FULL of LEAVES!!! We almost had to go buy some more because we thought we were gonna run out. We got done early but not before I got blisters on both my hands and just got plum worn out. At any rate, it was still fun. Even though I get exhausted from working during Big Event I still look forward to doing it the next year. There is just something about helping out people that need the help, and I guess I'm willing to take a little bit of sweat and pain to give that help. I like doing it, what can I say?"

"event","I just met our two new junior yell leaders! I feel like a bit of a dork, but oh well. 

Down here at A&M we don't have cheerleaders; we have yell leaders. Every year the student body gets to elect the yell leaders, 3 juniors who will be seniors and 2 sophomores who will be juniors. Well, I was in line for Chick-fil-a tonight and I recognized that they guy in front of me was one of the two guys who won a junior yell position. I had met him before so I figured why not congratulate him? So I tapped him on the shoulder and congratulated him and he got this big smile on his face and was like ""Well thank you!"" and he shook my hand and asked me what my name was. He even recognized me from earlier this week. Then the guy in front of him sticks out his hand and says ""Hey I'm Grant..."" ""Castleberry, yeah I know. Congratualations to you, too! Yeah, I voted for both of you so this is pretty cool."" *Oh, they are so cute!* So after feeling like a total dork Grant says ""So Melissa. What are you up to tonight?"" ""Oh just a whole lot of nothin'."" ""Yeah, those are the best nights."" ""I'm actually going to go watch Field of Dreams."" ""Awesome. Are you like a Kevin Costner fan or something?"" ""No, but I've been to the field in Iowa where they filmed it so I've always been interested in the movie."" ""Cool, well you have a good night, and thanks again."" ""Yeah, y'all have a good night too."" On top of this, the guy at the register started talking to me about that field because he had been there too. Those have to have been about 5 of the best yet weirdest minutes of my life. 

Just thought I should share. :)"

"event","Oh Livejournal, how I have missed you. And my Livejournal friends, I have not forgotten about you! I can't tell you how many times in the past week I've thought to myself that I needed to update my livejournal, I just never got around to it. So here goes:

Spring Break:
On Monday, I got up at 4:30AM to get to the airport for my 6:45AM flight. Oh, boy. It's just not right for a person to get on a plane before the sun comes up, but atleast it was a good flight. When I landed in Tampa I called mom to tell her I made it ok, and then realized that I had no idea where I was going. I tried following the signs to the baggage claim and they led me to these two red tunnels at the end of the building. I let mom go to take a call from Matt and he told me to get on the tram and it would take me to where he and my family were. *ok?* So when I got off the tram and saw Matt, Dave, David, and Lisa I was so happy! After we got my suitcase we went to the apartment complex that Mandy is going to live in next year. Very nice!! I'm pretty sure the ceiling in the bathroom won't cave in at this place! ;) After we checked out the new digs, Mandy parked her car on campus and we went to lunch at Tijuana Flatts. Muy Bueno!!! A short trip to the mall and a tour of the USF campus (which is very big and spread out and pretty!) with Mandy and Emma, next thing I know we are off to Nokomis to Corky and Betty's place. 

Tuesday was another early morning. Emma, Mandy and I got up at 6:30AM and left at 6:45AM to pick up Matt and David to go to Busch Gardens in Tampa, where we met Mandy's friend Jessica. It was a sight to see, all five of us crammed in the Omni!  Busch Gardens was awesome, and I actually rode rollercoasters! After Busch Gardens we went back to Nokomis and all of us went to a Chinese buffet to eat, where Matt paid for dinner and David pigged out on Chinese donuts...24 to be exact. We figured that 24 Chinese donuts is roughly equivalent to 6 regular donuts, plus the other food that he had. It's a miracle he didn't get sick. 

Wednesday we got to sleep in!!! Dave's mom and stepdad, Shirley and Jack, came over and all of us, sans Corky and Betty, went to go see the property Dave and Lisa bought and the house they want to build. The house was amazing! While all 9 of us were in the master bathroom (AMAZING!), a police officer walked in saying ""yeah, I've heard a lot about this bathroom so I just had to come see it."" After lunch at Wendy's and chocolate-lime ice cream at The Grove, we went back and changed into our swimsuits and set out for the beach. But because the red tide was too strong we had to come back to the park swimming pool, which was still awesome! And yes, it is fun to swim in the rain. 

Thursday. Oh my goodness. Thursday is the day I was looking forward to all week. Anyone who knows me knows that I am a big NASCAR fan, so when Matt told me that Dave wanted to take us all to see Daytona International Speedway I just about jumped out of my skin. We left at about 9, ate breakfast at a Cracker Barrel and then set out on our way to Daytona. What was supposed to be a 3 hour trip turned into an almost 6 hour trip because of a detour we had to take around Orlando. Once we got to Daytona USA it was awesome. We couldn't go out on the track because of the rain, but we atleast got to see an IMAX movie and Jeff Gordon's Daytona 500 car and a lot of other cool stuff. Matt and David got to participate in a practice pit stop where they changed a tire on a race car. Later on they raced against each other in these virtual reality race cars, and Mandy and I got to ride along with Matt and David, respectively. And who won? David! He doesn't even have his license and he beat Matt in this race. I think Matt was a little embarassed but he wouldn't tell you even if he was. After Daytona USA we got our picture taken on a very cold and windy Daytona Beach and then had dinner at Bubba Gump's, this really neat restaurant fashioned after Forrest Gump the movie. We ended up in this little room at one table and a bunch of college kids got put at the other table. Everyone, minus us 4 underaged kids, was taking shots in honor of St. Patrick's Day. After dinner we swung by Dave's sister's place so he and Lisa could give them presents they bought, and at 10PM we left for our drive back to Nokomis. By 12:45AM we were back at Corky and Betty's place. My brother, have a lead foot? Nah! ;)

Friday we all went to the beach in St. Pete, and then :( I had to leave :( and go back to DFW. The rest of my time at home was basically spent bumming around and doing little to nothing. 

The next weekend I went home to celebrate Easter with my family. It was a little cold, but it was fun nonetheless. The day after I got back (this week) I had a lot of homework due, on Tuesday I had a Diffeq test, and Thursday I had a presentation due. Needless to say, I am exhausted. To add to my frustrations over the week, on Thursday I found out that I made a 58 on the diffeq test, meaning that if I want to pass the class I need to get at least a 68 on the final. So I went to talk to my prof and he told me that if I worked really hard for about 2 hours a day every day that I could pass the class. Go me. I really dug myself a hole this time. But I think I can do it. I think I can pass it. No, I know I can pass it.

I also went to talk to my advisor today regarding what I want to study for a major. He was really nice, answering my questions about what got him interested in Civil Engineering, how many majors I could take and when I had to declare them, and if I got a D in a class if I would be kicked out of CE. He was awesome. Although mechanical engineering has appealed to me before, and still does on some levels, I think I'm just gonna stick it out in civil. Yeah, I'm just gonna stick it out. 

I'm kinda pissed off at my team in ENGR 213. We've known since mid-February that our presentation for our term paper was due on March 31. Every week or two the guys would sit there and say ""well, I guess we need to get started on our paper. where do we start? what should we do?"" and they end up looking at me, like I'm gonna give them all the answers or something. Before we left for spring break I sent all of them an email detailing the 20 ways that drugs can be administered and the 5 stages of a drug in a person's body. I even went as far as to split of the list so that every person would have 5 things to research as far as drug administration. Do you think they can even do this? NO! It pissed me off so bad when one of them IMed me and said ""I don't really have to research these things if Justin's are the most commonly used, do I?"" WTF do you think?! So after not working on it during spring break or the week following spring break, I sold my soul in a sense and made a deal with them, that I would make the presentation if the other two who attend class would do the lab (Justin, guy #3, is in the army and can't normally make it to class). They agreed and off we went. In the meantime, Justin sent me this really long email with all the research that he did and has even offered to help out more on the paper. And he's busy with the army! Clint and BJ, the other two, had the nerve to ask if Justin had sent me anything and if he was getting credit for the paper or presentation even though he wasn't gonna be there to help present. My answer: ""Yeah, he's getting credit because he actually researched and sent me information."" And then they wouldn't hardly follow the notes that I wrote them for the presentation and ended up stuttering and fumbling up stuff. They made me so mad. I'm gonna make them research stuff for the paper, because now they have a presentation in front of them and it should be a cake walk to look up stuff. GRRRR!

Well folks, I'm hungry and need to get my math homework done for the day, so I'll ttyl. And may I say, THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY!!!!!

By the way, HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISS SHARI MARIE!!!!"

I can't do this on-the-computer crap! Then somehow in my nervousness and confusion the process worked it's way out of my fingers to the keyboard and into the computer, and I got the right answer! YAY!!! To add to my happiness I found out that my TA's name is Ryan Newman. How great is that for a Nascar fan?! I love it!!!"

"event","Today I got a call from mom saying that Matt had been sick since 3AM, and at 1PM was sitting in Harris HEB's Emergency Room. Yeah, that'll set you on your ass. Apparently he was just really dehydrated, which caused him to have a fever and a really high pulse rate. After 6 hours and 3 liters of saline, the ER doc dismissed him. He gave him a prescription for something and told him to go buy another thing to make him all better. I'm just glad he's doing ok. I talked to him online before I talked to mom on the phone. I asked him ""you're not going into work tomorrow, are you?"", and he was like ""i might, i don't know."" Man, he'd better not. He needs to give his body time to rest and recouperate. I think he works himself too hard. Poor guy. I usually make fun of Matthew when he does something stupid, but this time I actually cried when mom told me because I know that Matt doesn't go to the hospital unless he's almost dead, and the thought of being 200 miles away when something like this happens is rather unsettling. Anyway, I'm rather glad and thankful that he was better enough to be discharged. I just hope he takes care of himself from now on. No more hospital Matthew, you hear me? NO MORE!!! The only time I want to hear of you being in the hospital is when your working at AMH, ok? I feel better now..."

"event","After a discussion with Renee, I have decided that I would be a bad European. By this I mean that I'm shy, I shower everyday, I shave too often, I wear deoderant, and I like ketchup instead of mayo. I guess this ruins my plans of taking over France. Wait, what's that Renee? France doesn't offer anything except cowards? Oh yes, I had forgotten. I guess this means I'll have to take over Switzerland. They have a history of neutrality so I suppose my usurping their government wouldn't ruffle a whole lot of feathers. And after all, 1) Switzerland is where people set up bank accounts to hide their money from the feds, 2) They have CHOCOLATE!!! But what else could I possibly want with Switzerland? I'm a quarter Swede, an eigth German, and an eigth Norweigan, atleast that I know of. So why wouldn't I take over those countries instead? Or what about smaller countries that no one really cares about like Estonia or Lichtenstein? Screw it! I don't want to take over anything! Just send me to a place somewhere in the sun. Yes, like the Maldives or Tahiti or Bora Bora (providing none of these places were wiped out by the Tsunami). Or what about Hawaii? Maybe somewhere in the Caribbean? No, those are both too...what's the word?...touristy? I suppose I could go to Africa if I wanted to be eaten by a lion, or Asia if I wanted to get some kind of dengue fever or to be shot by Osama and his cronies. There's always Antarctica where I could royally freeze my ass off, or South America where I could get a cup of coffee and a gram of cocaine in the same store. What about Australia? Hmm, there's a thought. Although, everybody lives on the coast and that would get pretty crowded. So I guess this leaves me with North America. Latin America: I know enough Spanish to get into trouble but not enough to get out of it. Canada, well, there's nothing really wrong with Canada except they get OOBER COLD in the winter. Chilly! Thus I am left with the good ol' U.S. of A. But where in these great states should I reside? Most of the east is too, dare I say, blue stated. Same thing with California (although they have happy cows). New Mexico and Arizona are too arid. Oregon and Washington are too wet. Idaho and Montana...people actually live there?...and CLAIM IT?! Colorado is pretty but it gets run over with skiiers and tourists. Utah...well...who lives in Utah anyway? What crazy person decided to put a casino in the middle of nowhere in Nevada?! The midwest and north central u.s. is pretty in the summer, but it's pretty much ruled out because of it's frigid winters. All Kansas has going for it is I-35. Who wants to live in a state where people will joke that you live in misery in Missouri? Oklahoma and Arkansas? Yeah, we'll just leave it at that. Louisiana has too many swamps. Mississippi is too hard to spell on a day to day basis. Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina still have problems with the whole rebel flag issue. Florida, well atleast they got their voting act together. I can't say much for the old folks driving who shouldn't be driving, and let's not forget the FOUR hurricanes that pounded the state last year. North Carolina, well it's the Nascar capital of the world but they get hurricanes too. When I think of Tennessee I think of country music and mountain men. There's nothing wrong with country music, but some of those people living in rural Tennessee are extremely scary and should not be bothered. Trust me, I know. Virginia and Maryland are out of it because they sandwich in Washington D.C. and, no offense to those reading, I wouldn't really want to live around a bunch of lawmakers who talk out of both sides of their mouth anyway. This leaves Texas. Yes, Texas, MY Texas (I'll save you from hearing the whole song). I mean think about it. Texas is big enough that every person in the world could fit inside and have 100 square feet of space to themselves. That's pretty freakin' awesome. Not only that, but if for some unforseeable wacky reason Texas should ever split from the Union, there are enough resources for it to last for centuries. Oil, natural gas, cows, cotton, electricity(sometimes), defenses, airplanes, cars, etc. Texas has it all. So I guess Texas is the place that I should choose to take over from the rest of the world. But there's no need to do that. Why would I want to have Texas all for myself? I want to share it with other people. I think Pat Green said it best: ""I sing songs about Texas, I sing them often as if she were some old lover I used to know...So sing me one more song about those dusty plains, them honky tonk angels and their lonely beehive pains, wish I was stowed away on some fast movin' train goin' home, I'm a goin' home."" But of course, I'm already home. :)  I really don't know how I got from being a bad European to loving Texas, but what matters is that I got to Texas. YAY!!!"

"event","So I went home this past weekend. Time went WAY TOO QUICKLY there. I think mainly because I thought I would get to rest and do nothing, but this was impossible because of all the things I needed to do (i.e. landry, homework, errands, etc.). Gwen asked me my honest opinion of the wallpaper that she and mom picked out so I flat out told her that I wasn't too crazy about it. It's this beige background with pearlized swirlies in it and a border that has this crappy flower mess on it. Mom and Gwen think it's pretty, but quite frankly I think it's too dated, too froo-froo. I don't give a damn if it goes with the black and yellow tile, it's UGLY!!! Gwen seems to think the room is messed up by the black tile. WHAT?! Hello, black goes with anything. It's a matter of finding a color that goes with the yellow. So then she and Curtis started asking me all these questions at lunch on Sunday like ""well what colors do you want to put in there?"",""do you want to paint it or use wallpaper?"",""what do you see going in there?"" I DON'T KNOW!!! I'm not going to decide what the bathroom should be like while I'm worried about the weather and getting back to College Station, and certainly not before I get the chance to look around at color schemes that can go in the bathroom. GRR!!

Anywho...I got the new Kenny Chesney CD this weekend at Target, as well as Tim McGraw's latest. Kenny's album is cool, just laid back, sit-back-and-relax music. I've been listening to it almost nonstop since I got back. yay!

I was so not into my 8AM class this morning. I got there and was doing homework for another class while my prof was going over the quiz he handed back. My teammate, BJ, was like *sarcastically* ""You're really lovin' this, aren't you?"" When we had a break and were supposed to be talking about crystal structures we started talking about the rain, Groundhog Day, and then BJ invited Clint and me to eat breakfast with him at PiRSquare, but I couldn't because I had to do homework. *sad* Aside from when I was talking to my teammates, I basically didn't want to be there at all. I predict a similar case for my next class and the class after that. I mean, it's cold and it's raining. I'm not supposed to be into days like this. Plus I'm getting sick. I tried to tell myself that I wasn't, but my allergies flaired up and I got a really scratchy throat yesterday and started running a fever. Plus flu is running rampant down here, so way to go Melissa! 

I got one of my scholarship applications finished and turned in. yay! Only 3 more to go. Whoohoo! It's weird, like I didn't have my ass in gear last semester about stuff like scholarships and resumes and majors/minors and now I'm getting it all together. I thought about doing Habitat for Humanity this semester, but I don't know if I'll have the time to do it. I mean, I'm sure I can make the time for it but I've never built a house before and it costs $30 to join. Yeah. Orientation is tomorrow so I'd better make my mind up quickly.

UGH! The time has come for another class, so I must be off. Until next time, I love you all!!!"

Departing    March 14  DFW  6:46AM
Arriving     March 14  TPA  9:57AM

Departing    March 18  TPA  5:07PM
Arriving     March 18  DFW  6:57PM

Yes, I know 6:46AM is an insane time for me to choose to depart, but it had more seats available and I figure that getting to Tampa at 10AM means that there's still plenty of time to do stuff that day. I chose to come back the 18th instead of the 19th because I realized that I had to do laundry and it won't get done if I come back on Saturday. Hmm...I think that about does it. Mandy, IM me if you want any more details or just call me if you want.

It feels good to get that out of the way. Today has been just a big day of hit-and-miss as far as trying to do things and failing misserably. Atleast I KNOW I got this right because I got my receipt and itinerary via email. YAY!!!!!

I'm going home this weekend. Double yay!!! I have a LOT of things that I don't use here that I need to take back home. Plus the fact that I LOVE MY MOMMY and miss her quite a bit, and I LOVE MY BUDDY and miss him, too. Whenever mom calls she gets the dog to bey into the phone; it's so cute!!! One time, my mom set the phone down because she had to get something from the garage, so I started talkin' to the dog. Yes, I felt stupid trying to talk to the dog, but he actually came over to the phone! I heard his collar clanking up by the phone, and mom said when she came in he was sniffing her cell phone. My puppy is so adorable!!! 

Tonight our dorm held a general hall meeting to decide what intramurals we were going to participate in this semester. We chose basketball, outdoor soccer, and...BOWLING!!!! Hell yeah! I am SO gonna go bowling atleast once. Among the 15 people that were at the meeting nobody but myself had ever gotten over 100 points. Oh man! Even if our hall doesn't do the best it'll be fun making fools of ourselves! 

I'm so sad that Johnny Carson died. I mean, I know he hasn't done anything for over 10 years, but he was a really funny guy. I tried buying some DVDs of his but their all sold out everywhere. I guess I know what to ask for next Christmas, 'cause that's the soonest that those DVDs will probably be in stock.

Tomorrow is another 8AM day. yay. happy...not. I'm just happy that I don't have any homework due yet in any classes. I guess I should go get my beauty sleep (hahaha) so I'll talk to y'all later."

i'm happy that i know atleast one person in all of my classes with the exception of ethics. the folks in engr213 are nice, will and gretchen are in cven305, memo is in math308, and steven and matt are in cven302 with me. everyone is nice and talks to me but matt. it kinda bothers me that both times i've tried to say hi to him he just ignores me. maybe it's just me, or maybe he's mad that i ""poked"" him on facebook. whatever the case is i was just trying to be nice. oh well, no more trying.

would you believe that it's the 3rd day of class and two of my profs are already administering quizzes? such is the case in cven305 and math308. yay. speaking of, i need to refresh my printing skills in the blocker building, so i should get up there before my class. this means i'll leave you now and update later. i know i say this all the time and never do it, but i promise this time!!"

Today we salute you, stressed out college student, during exam week. As you sit in your lonely cubical in the library, doped up on Starbucks & Aderol, you think to yourself, 'am I ever going to need to know this stuff in life?' The distractions are tempting and you have suddenly diagnosed yourself with ADD along with advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage. I'm sure by now you know exactly what everyone is doing because you have checked your buddy list 800 times. Christmas break is just days away, and your Prozac prescription will be in tomorrow. So crack open an ice cold Budweiser after that last exam, because for most of us, Christmas will be spent in rehab.

Yep. That pretty much sums it up, minus the whole Budweiser part, of course. Can I just have Dale Jr. instead? :P Just kidding!!! 

Two exams down, two more to go. I think I passed the first two, which is good, and I think I'll do pretty well on my History exam tomorrow, providing that I actually read and study for it. Last night instead of studying or making my cheat sheets for stat like I should have, Renee sent me this pic of her and Bill. I told her that they looked Amish, and that if she let me mess with it on Paint that I could make it look quasi American Gothic. Oh my gosh, was that so much more fun than studying. If any of you want to see the picture, do one of two things:

1) either comment to me and i will e-mail it to you, or
2) tell me how the hell i upload a picture on here. 

Off to get food and study. Bleh...study...pooh."

I've been on the phone on and off with mom all day asking her what meds I should take and what not. This evening I had just gotten through talking to mom and was about to get started on my engineering homework (which is crap to do when you can't think straight anyway) when I got a call from Mandy who was at a Rascal Flatts concert. She was like ""Melissa, just listen,"" and held the phone up so I could hear the band. How cool is that? I've never been to see them, but because of Mandy I felt like I was really there. Let me tell you guys, it was a small simple gesture that some might overlook, but that one minute phone call totally made my day. Thank you Mandy!"

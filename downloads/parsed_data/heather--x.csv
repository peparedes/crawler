In double Admin Debs, Alison, Natz, Stacey and I had a party for me! We made some banners and pictures and stuck them up on the wall...haha Mr C better not take them down or he'll have ""The Funky Monkeys"" to answer to PMSL! My last ever lunchtime choir practise was funny too! I said bye to Ramsey (the music teacher) and he ignored me :| Then Debs asked if he was gonna miss me...he said no cause he'd see me next week! So i goes eerrr no you wont and he said why arent you commin to choir? So i said cause i hate you all PMSL! So yes he tripped me up and Heather was nearly flat on her face *no impressed* LOL!

Then during my free period Karina, Heather and I sat and had a chat, we all ended up in tears (all because of the bitch) and we decided we will meet up once a month and catch up!

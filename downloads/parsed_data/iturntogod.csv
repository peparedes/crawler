"event","<b>Passion</b> is and always will be lustful thinking for most middle aged women. However, for those of us who are in their prime, aren't thinking but are acting on. Let me re-phrase that, for those of us who have a brain and are in their prime aren't thinking on they are acting on. Now not to get confused with Sebastian's poor choices in sexual partners, I'm way pickier in who I let in my bedroom. To him it's all about the challenge no matter how pretty the girl actually is, which is sometimes a benefit for me depending on what arrangements have been set up.

Passion is really just a good fuck for those in their teens, and when I saw a good fuck.. I mean a good fuck that will just blow your mind away. Now not every sexual encounter will be good, some encounters may be so horrible you fall asleep or try to hide the agony of waiting for it to be over. Now I've had my fair share of losers but almost all of my choices have had their way about them that sent me to a really happy place.

Dream on Sebastian, <i>never</i> going to be you.

So to recap, good fuck equals the only passion a teenager could ever get. Though take out the passion in teenagers all you got is a bunch of teasers that wouldn't know a dick if it slapped them in the face. Which really is a whole other story that is best told in one of those teen movies that are supposed to be <i>funny.</i> Now if you'll excuse me for not caring this is all I really have to say.

"event","I once had a dream that high school was finally over and it was time to move on with me life. At first I felt scared being all alone in the big city but slowly it became easier the more I walked through the city. I know walking through the city is not the best idea but it sort of felt like a personal goal which I had never even considered it before. It made me smile once I reached the front door of NYC as it seemed to be a second home to me. I even knew where my dorm room would be, who would be in it and where my class schedule was located in my bedroom(it was kind of hidden under a desk for mysterious reason I guess.)

The whole dream just really made me feel at ease toward the end.

Which of course around the time I was about to wake up things went a little crazy which I think a clown may have escorted me to my first class. I don't really know what that was all about.

<b>{Locked}</b>
You know I always thought Sebastian was a fag but after writing this bullshit I'm starting to actually see it. Describe a fucking dream, are you kidding me?

Ok here goes.

Sebastian had walked into my room after having a long night with 'Retard Barbie Cakes.' The sweat was dripping down his highly irritated face as he stormed up to my bed. I, of course, was shocked at his bold move but felt somewhat turned on. A part of me wanted to resist but as he pushed me down as I attempted to get up.. it was then I knew-

I was Sebastian's dreams. I can feed you all the bullshit you can take  but honest sincere answers that you're looking for, go find Oprah Fucking Winfrey. I wrote the book in snagging diaries/journals, though some more successive than others with a life goal to get a hold of Sebastian's, so why would I honestly want to keep a paper trail of all my own lies and deceit. 

Exactly.

"event","Kathryn watched as the pathetic little troll walked out of the room in what one would think she'd assumed was a 'sexy' walk. It took everything in her power not to just vomit right then and there but as she smiled at Cecile and Mrs. Caldwell it was clear to her that there was much work to be done. The fact that Kathryn herself could lure Mrs. Caldwell into allowing her to mentor her moronic dip shit daughter was far beyond her but it always did help to keep such a good reputation.

""Sook-Hee, that will be all.""

Kathryn practically had to shoo her away, it's good to know her decrepit alcoholic step-father had been teaching Sook-Hee good work ethic in the bedroom but too much outside was just plain creepy. Kathryn noted that Sebastian was running late from his therapy session, had his conquest already ratted him out? That she didn't worry too much about as the girl he was after was known for being easy or she was her senior year after stepping on Kathryn's student council duties.

It's all about the way you present yourself, reputation is everything.

Now if you are sincerely the stereotypical reputation you up hold then a slight suggestion of suicide would be the only advice Kathryn could give you. To stand tall as Virgin Mary next to the quarterback name fucking Chip was not one of her favorite positions to be in, even though there was in fact many.

She quickly pulled out her rosary as the meeting alone drained her down and she had been promised that her last purchase was elite merchandise. Quickly she did a few lines before she heard the sounds of the front door opening, the sounds of course was extremely loud so it only made her think that a special someone had finally arrived back home.

""Oh Sebastian-"" She shouted innocently as he bolted through the door. Her smirk was big, as was his and it was obvious they both had to lots of things to say to each other. ""You didn't by any chance run into Mrs. Caldwell did you?"" She paused for a moment as she could see the filthy expression on his face. Raising an eyebrow she continued, ""I'm sure you were at least on your best behavior."" She stated before closing her rosary back up.

"event","I spent the night with Anthony last night,whenever we do that it makes me feel so much closer to him and then when the next night comes I feel miserable.  He was kinda a dick head yesterday to me throughout the day, he was talking with his guys about how he fucked the rat face lookin girl that works at the gas station, and I got pissed off. He said that I try to act like I am his girl and shit, what a prick, cuz honestly, we do things that couples do, and Im sorry Im not a fucken hoe and I actually sleep with the poeple I care about...I dont know, I love him to death and I pray like every night that we will be together, and I  hope someday he will realize that I can make him happy if he gives me the chance....

Laura, Jina, Sam S. and Sam M. all hung out today after I worked.  We just drove around and went to Taco Bell, the usual shit, then we went over to Alex's house, we just sat around, they were having a little pre-memorial day bash and mandy's bday party.  It was so ackward being there, seeing as my former best friend use to live there, now she is in New York, I guess she is coming to town next weekened and staying for 3 weeks, I will try and call her, I wanted to get the ""BSG"" back together, but it probably will not work out...

Well, I am getting tired, and as usual I gotta work tommorw, so im gonna hit the hay....peace out!!"

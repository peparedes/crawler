apparently there was this couple, and the man had a child from another relationship, but his ex wife was a bitch, and there was this huge custody battle going on..and for some reason it was at jenny's house...and i think one of those involved was her brother.

then me, becca, and other various members of my family were driving down the road in a minivan, and there was this guy laying in a bloody mess on the side of the road with a hole in his stomach, like he had been shot. for some reason nobody stopped to help him, even though he was stil moving and calling for help. we passed him about 3 times, still laying there...and there were some people on bikes...that's all i remember about that 

then the family and i were at this pool...like at a hotel..and apparently it was some party for school, yet my family was there...and the same guy was floating in the pool with a bunch of green oozy stuff surroundnig him..and everyone just passed him by. for some reason we were all given surfboards about the size of a notebook, and the pool had these waves and apparently if you didn't hang onto the surfboad and face the wave, you'd die. the woman who plays ray's mother on everybody loves raymond was there, and she warned me about that. then i passed the floating man again, and went out into the parking lot(basically this dream was a lot of going back and forth, seeing the same guy) and becca was standing there talking to some guy, only she was like 7 feet tall...and for some reason i had a different car. in the dream i remember my mom telling me i needed to buy a new car...but  ican't remember why.so i bought a green chevy aveo. me and becca were apparently going out to my car to smoke pot or something, when the person who plays the fat, obnoxious guy from malcolm in the middle who works with lois(craig, i think) came up with his two sons, who were rod and tod flanders...yes, from the simpsons. he was telling me something about them leaving and never coming back and being pissed off...and of course i was angry because we coudln't get high.

then i entered the pool area, passed the floating guy again, and stepped onto some dock area. apparently brandi and kim were having a scavenger hunt or something, and kim was holding monopoly money in her hand...and there was an outhouse. i said hi to both of them, went back into the water, and then i saw the everybody loves raymond lady and asked her if we should go help the guy. she said ""he won't give me his raft. he won't let me help him"" so i said maybe if a lot of us went over there, he'd listen. we all walked over, and there was like..30 foot long pieces of shit on the pool floor. the creepy maitinence man from Dark Water was there...standing on the edge of some cement platform which was the pool entrance and sweeping all the green stuff that had been surrounding the guy under the gate(supposedly into a pool filter) he was standing up, and he was ok. some guy was saying something like ""all he had to eat was a chocolate cake..""

then we went back out into the parking lot and my cousins cathy, anna and steve were there, and there were 1000's of cars all trying to leave at the same time...like when a concert gets out and i remember hitting someone's car and saying ""who the hell is that?""

i don't exactly remember where this part fits in, but i was in sarah's van, and she was there, kristen was in the very back, and her dad was in the front. i said something, kristen said ""i'm sorry"" or something like that...i don't remember what sarah said...and apparently there was another identical van which brandi, nikki, and some other people were in."

"event","Last night's:

My whole school was walking down this big hill, and we were all really excited to get to wherever we were going. There were storm clouds in the sky and you could hear thunder and rain in the distance. Finally at the bottom of the hill there was this run-down shack...it looked like Hagrid's house from the harry potter movies...only, you know, minus the hippogriff and other assorted magical creatures. Apparently it was the house of this girl from my school who isn't too fond of me, and when I got near it i heard laghter and a tv, so i turned and started walking f ast back the other way. on my way up the hill, i saw this other girl who isn't fond of me, her former best friend, and they were pushing her grandma in a wheelchair. something looked strange about her, or seemed strange, but i put it out of my head. then, a dairy queen appeared for whatever reason, and i went inside. it looked like the inside had caught on fire, and there was mold or moss or something growing on the walls, and it was a sit-down restaraunt. The waitress came up to me(i knew her from someplace) and asked me what i wanted, and i told her i wanted the chocolate french silk pie blizzard. she put down the little thingy waitresses use to write down orders and said ""is that any good? *intense laughter* i've never tried it"" and i told her i had had one the other day and she said ""ok, i'll bring that right out for you"" then i was looking around for my purse because for some reason it was customary to pay the waitress exactly as she brought your food, and i coudln't find it. then i like telepathically channeled my mom and told her i coudln't find my purse, and she said something, but i dont' remember what. then the girls and the wheelchair granny walked in again, and i noticed that what was weird about her was she had an oxygen tank hooked up to her and she was comatose.

and then i remember having one about my house being posessed and the walls shaking and bleeding.
    

Then, back in the real world, scott and i went to great lakes. i was supposed to go with bani bani, but SOME people like to get grounded *glares at* so i bought sconty lunch at rainforest cafe, then spent my paycheck...what's amazing is i still have about $60 left over...which is a first for me. There was this aphrodesiac incense...and this scary black lady...it was fun!!!"

"event","Me, Becca, Brandi, and about 75 % of my school were in some bead/craft store or something, and I was playing katamari damacy...only i was like...in the game. I was rolling around the ball and throwing mardi gras beads and feathers and glitter and stuff onto it...and then I said something like ""look! my katamari is glamtastic!"" and proceeded to pick up stuffed animals, knives, etc. then I was at work, only it was the perry burger king instead, and i wasn't working i was just there. and this kid from my school saw me and made a big deal that i was working there because apparently he hated me, so i told him i hoped he burns in hell. then he went into a portapotty. then i was in some hallway which was apparently an entrance to a chapel, and there were nuns everywhere, and one of my old friends i went to europe with was there, and we were all walking inside because i guess i wanted to convert to catholicism. then we were walking back outside and there was a synchronized swimming team changing out of their bathing suits, and there was this one girl with really deep cuts all over her legs and arms, and i saw her and coudln't stop staring at them, and she tried to hide them with a green towel and i tried telling her she didn't have to be embarrassed and hide them from me because i understood and wouldn't laugh at her or something, but i had lost my voice...i tried shouting but my voice was all raspy and non-existant...and i knew her from some place; at first i thought she was the girl from the chapel that i went to europe with, but later i realized she was a younger version of myself.

Guh.

In other news, chocolate french silk blizzards from dairy queen are delicious.

My last paycheck was huge and I wanna go shopping, but it looks like that's out of the question..

"event","I felt a new journal was necessary, since I didn't like the idea of certain people having access to the old one...so here it is folks!(once again, I like to fool myself into thinking somone is actually reading this)

Work is insane. And I was sick today and left early...certain people in the kitchen were giving me headaches.

Sconty's birthday party was last night...which was immense love and greatness. There were FIREWORKS!! And Frank's a funny kid...Tarah and Ashley were there, too. What a groovy bunch of kids.

Also, went out to dinner with The Lover on thursday(mongolian barbeque) and spend the rest of the day with him. So it's been a good week.

Some people just need to be euthanized...

I want my paycheck."

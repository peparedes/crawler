"event","So aside from the entry i wrote last night at 2 am, i'm pretty good I guess.

My Three Rivers shit is straightened out, although it's not the way i wanted it to be. My classes ended up getting all messed up because my guidance counselor never sent my transcript when i gave him 2 weeks notice! All he had to do was either print a copy and have me come pick it or, or fax it over! How hard is that?!?!!? Oh well. I'm taking 13 credits, so it shouldn't be too bad. i would take more but there's NOTHING left open that works with my schedule. I have English on MW 4-5:20, Principals of Environmental Science on R from 6:30-9:30, Algebra on W from 6-8:45, and Accounting on TR from 12:30-2:20. So it's not too bad, but like i said, not at all what i wanted. School starts tomorrow! YAY! And my books are going to be around $400! Another YAY!

Kyle and I had the best day ever on Monday. It was the first time since I lived in RI that we got to spend the whole day together! He came over around 11:45, so we went on an hour long bike ride and stopped at the beach to get Chili Dogs and fries for lunch! Then I went and cleaned the pool while Kyle watched Zeus......he ended up jumping off the table onto the chair, onto the deck, onto the ground, then ran and hid in the wood pile. Now for a guinea pig of only 8 ounces and 5 weeks old, that's a REALLY long fall! Not to mention that i though i lost him when he went and hid in the wood pile by the woods! Luckily Kyle and Rusty found him! So I went to give him a bath and he jumped right out of my hands onto the floor! He's crazy! And speaking of that, he's running around in circles in his cage right now! I've had him a little over a week now, and he's definitely warmed up a lot. He's not as shy and hes so dman loud! Most guinea pigs will spueak when they hear you getting their food or treats, but Zeus? No, he does it ALL the time, 10 times louder than I've ever heard a guinea pig squeak before! He's so cute though! :) Anway, we went to the mall and looked around for a little while.....I found some gorgeous jewelry that i wanted, but the cheapest one I found was like $250! Of course the one i really wanted was on sale for $80, but someone had already bought it :'( Oh well. We went to Target and looked at Bikes for Kyle, pretty much just hanging out and having a good time. We went on another bike ride that night which was really cool, and we finished watching Matchstick Men, which was an awesome movie! We started to watch Fight Club but my mom had a hissy fit so Kyle had to go home at 12:30. Apparently she can't go to sleep until Rusty and i are both home, or everyone but the two of us is out of the house. She's weird....maybe she thinks we're going to have sex even though she's right next door! GROSS! Whatever. OH! And we had an ""anniversary"" cake too! I could go on and on about our day together but I'm sure I have bored you enough already. I hope everyone has a good night! YAY for school tomorrow....i think!"

"event","So the last few days have been kinda weird. I worked on Friday, for the first time in forever, so that was really cool. Besides the fact that my arms and my back are killing me from lifting 500lb coolers of ice, and that's not an exaggeration of weight either! Some couple spent around $6,000 on a picnic that only 30 people out of 90 showed up at. Cool huh? i wish i had money like that to throw away. The house they're in right now cost $1,000,000 and it's actually their 2nd one :) UGH! i can't stand people with that kind of money! Anyway...Kyle eventually came over last night.........we rented a movie that ended up being in chinese so we went back and switched it for Matchstick Men. We haven't finished it yet, but hopefully we will get to do that on Monday. 

Today was alright, we went to Clinton Factory Outlets, and it poured all damn day. I got a $7 Jawbreaker :) It's the size of a softball! How awesome is that?! I haven't decided if i'm going to eat it or keep it in the wrapper yet. My bro and I went to the mall for a while tonight and I got a pair of Pink Nike's.....not the pair i wanted, but they're cute enough anyway.

Tomorrow will be either going to the mall with my brother, or going to Cape Cod with him to see Heidi for the day. I would love to go to Cape Cod and go mini-golfing with them, but i'm sure i'd feel like the 3rd wheel, or more or less invisible since they haven't seen each other in a whole week! lol 

Monday i'm supposed to be hanging out with Kyle for the WHOLE day.....not sure if that's going to happen as it usually doesn't, but i can always hope right? Oh well.

He was supposed to call when he got out of work, but i haven't heard from him yet and there's no possible way he's still at Starbucks. What is it with him and calling?????

Still waiting................

Sleepy.............

Goodnight."

 My brother left for North Carolina with my cousin last Friday, and will be coming back this friday, the 20th. Saturday, Heidi and I went to the Art Festival cause i ""knew"" a girl who had ""art-work"" there. However, i thought you actually had to be good to get a booth?? I guess not :) We rented 13 Going on 30 which was a really cute movie! We also went to the pet store to check out all the animals and we ended up playing with a Yorkshire Terrier that she really wanted. He was $1600! How crazy is that? She spent the night and we went back to Fin and Feather so I could turn in my application. We played with the Terrier again, which she decided to call Sparky, and he was so damn cute! I even got pictures for her! She ended up going back on Monday, and her mom was going to buy him for her, but he had just been sold when they walked in the door! How much does that suck? :( I feel so bad for her!

 Monday i went to Three Rivers to take my placement test, but i got sent to the wrong campus, so i had to go back on Tuesday to take it.

Yesterday, Heidi and I went up to Three Rivers to take my test. The lady told Heidi she would have to wait about an hour and a half for me to finish, and it only took me 15 minutes. It was so easy!! After that we went to fin and feather to pick up Zeus, my guinea pig! I cried a lot cause I missed Zoe so much, but Zeus is just so cute! He's only about 2.5 inches long, and he fits right in the palm of my hand! He squeaks REALLY loud and he likes to climb up the side of his cage and run head on into the wall! :) We were wondering if maybe he's blind, poor thing :( He's only 4 weeks old, and they're not supposed to leave their mother for 7 weeks, so i don't know why they let him go so early, i'll have to take really good care of him :)

Kyle just came over this morning and we hung out for a little while before he had to leave for work at 1:45. It was fun though, and he even gave me a ""GOLD STAR"" ;) Sarah and I are going to hang out at 2 when she gets out of work! I'm excited cause I haven't seen her in a really long time, since the 4th of July I think. We're going to Bluff Point I guess which is cool cause I haven't been there in a long time :) 

Some people are total walking contradictions, and as much as it's hilarious, it's absolutely maddening! To hear someone contradict themselves every time they open their mouth starts to drive a person crazy after a while

Well, I'm gonna go do my chores and then play with Zeus till Sarah gets here. Hope everyone has a good day! :)"

"event","So Wednesday night, Kyle, Rusty, Heidi, and I all camped out in my backyard. It was SO much fun! We had a huge fire going, and we made S'Mores and stuff! We even got a little card table and played Monopoly by tiki-torch light. It was pretty cool. The tents ended up getting really hot in the morning though. Anyway, last night the four of us went to the last Esker Point Beach concert. The music was pretty gay, but we had fun anyway. I'm glad we all got to go atleast once.

I hung out with Kyle last night and we went to the mall to get him a pair of pants. Things are really good right now :) We're supposed to go see ""The Village"" tonight with Craig, Becca, and Michelle. We were originally going to go on the 31st, but it was sold out! POOP! lol

I buried Zoe in the backyard next to Milky Way and Patches on Sunday, as if that wasn't hard enough. I had to take her out of the box she was in....she was all stiff and her nose was all bloody from her hemorrhage :'( I put all the roses Heidi gave me on top of her little grave. 

Monday I saw Kyle for about an hour and then he went home.

Saw him again yesterday and we all went out to dinner, the 6 of us. We definitly had a lot of ""stuff"" to talk about. I will be seeing him again tonight, as we still have a lot of things to finish talking about and the four of us are going to be camping out in my backyard. We're also all hanging out again tomorrow night and going to the Esker Point Beach Cocnert. I was hoping to hang out with him on Friday and go to the movies, but i'm broke, so unless i get my job at the Seaman's Inn, I won't be able to go. Anyway, that's really it for now.

"event","I'm tired of this. I just want everything to be cleared up, over and done with. It's getting ridiculus.

I read your journal entry about your anniversary gift. We'll call that ""your side of the story"". I heard Chris's side of the story, along with a few others. I made a comment on your journal based on both sides of the story and the facts. I can't quote exactly what I said, as you have deleted it, but it was something along the lines of you seeming to be ungrateful for his gift. I'm sorry if I offended you or hurt your feelings by what I said.

You then replied, asking me not to judge your relationship with Chris, or you as a person. I NEVER did either of those things! I simply asked you to back that up and you didn't. Since you couldn't, why didn't you just drop it? No, you replied by saying i was a hypocrite for something i had written in my journal and going on and on about your school, how smart you are, how you don't want to know me or kyle, and how you like random people writing in your journal. That has nothing to do with the situation at hand. All I wanted to know was how I was judging you because I wasn't, whether you thought so or not. I wouldn't judge you because I don't really know you. I wouldn't judge your relationship with Chris, because I don't know anything about it. I made one comment in your journal about ONE particular situation.

You on the other hand said, ""i tend to like to see what other people that don't know the whole story feel. sometimes you get the best input from a third part that knows nothing about you. i have had random posts before and sometimes they bring up good points or make you realize something you would originally not have. you get to see yourself in someone else's perspective."" -However, you deleted all the posts i wrote, and everyone elses. Why would you do that if you wanted to hear what other people thought, or as you also said, you didn't care about other people's opinions? I got pissed off at that guy who wrote in my journal, but I didn't delete his comment, it's still there for everyone to see :)

You also said ""i don't know you and i really don't want to know about you and kyle. i came to the conclusion i don't want to know, and don't really care to know anymore. i felt you didn't need to know about chris and me, so i took you off."" - I never asked you to get to know Kyle and I, or me at all. So to say that, is pointless. When I read your journal, I wasn't reading it to get info on you and Chris or your relationship. I was simply reading it to get to know you as a person. I hope you weren't reading my journal just to read up on my relationship with Kyle, although that's what it sounds like. ""i don't know you and i really don't want to know about you and kyle. at first i did because i wanted to know why you and kyle got into so many fights and why you cry so much."" Nothing about knowing me as a person, just my relationship. And if you don't want to know about it, then don't read my damn journal.

This one REALLY cracks me up though! ""i was a little concerned when you put chris on your friends list."" Why? Did you think I was trying to get close to him? Plotting to break up with Kyle and try to steal him away from you? Or just try to get information about your relationship? Wow. Sorry, but i'm not that shallow. I'm prefectly happy with Kyle, the love of my life. Chris seems like a really nice guy from what I see and hear, but if you are worried about him being on my friends list, that makes you seem a little insecure. I simply put him on my friends list as i do everyone else, TO READ THEIR ENTRIES! Who would have thought?!?! That's just weird! :)

Another thing. ""you first said you wanted people to post, then you complain about the random people that post.you as a person should not say you want people to post based on the stuff you write. - I also explained that one to you before in my last entry, as did Kyle. A RANDOM person, from California possibly, or Texas, or wherever, who didn't even KNOW me, who i was, at all, wrote a stupid comment on my journal. This kid wasn't on my ""friends"" list, i don't know his name, or where he's from, or anything about him and vise-versa!I know who you are, and I know Chris. I don't really consider myself as (that) RANDOM, seeing how i was on your friends list. Yes, I will admit that I did yell at that person, and my response was angry. I could have handled it better but I didn't, and I can't go back and fix it now, but did you also happen to see the WHOLE entry I wrote after that about it? None of that was angry! I guess you could say that I wrote the first one as I had just read it and was VERY angry. After I'd blown off some steam and had time to think, I re-wrote what i thought. AND, it was only ONE entry. You make it seem like i yell at everyone who writes on my journal, when it was really only ONE time, and it was a LONG TIME ago. You must have gone through quite a few entries (46 actually, that's a lot) to dig that one up, but that's you're wasted time, not mine. 

Last but not least, ""and i only said the college comment to say that i am intelligent."" Well, the degrading comment didn't exactly make you look intelligent, but more or less arrogant. NOT that i was questioning it to begin with, which you still don't seem to get! I never said you were stupid or unintelligent, simply that you didn't know how to spell. I'm sorry that I said that, it was uncalled for. It also had nothing to do with the situation, which i've recently talked about, so again, i'm sorry.

So, to make this LONG, waste-of-my-time-story short, I never judged you or your relationship. Since i didn't, let's get over it already!

If you would like to reply to this, that's fine, but I've said my piece and I'm done. No hard feelings :)"

"event","So this week definitely goes down in the books as one of the worst weeks ever!!! I HATE going camping anyway. It rains almost every day and then every night you have to get into a wet and damp sleeping bag. When you wake up in the middle of the night, it's always a plus that it's 25* out! WOO! I've been away from Kyle for 8 days now, UGH, and he won't be back till tomorrow night, which makes 9 awfuly long days! For some reason we fought a lot on the phone, which really sucked a lot. Oh yea, almost forgot to tell you. There's NO cell phone service within two hours of the campground! There's ONE pay phone, and it's a mile away. So I think I talked to Kyle like 4 times and that was it. Partly cause he was working or didn't have service, and now he's in Pennsylvania. The worst part about it was that i can't go to sleep when i'm upset, so i was pretty much miserable the whole time :( Every day all I would talk about was how I couldn't wait to go home cause I missed my piggy Zoe! I was even talking about bringing her along next year, but decided that might be a bad idea seeing how it's so cold, she could die. 
I was starting to have a good time on Friday, until Saturday night. Rusty talked to Heidi, and I got the most devastating news ever. Zoe died late Friday night :'( I'm completely torn up inside. I loved her so much and i'm so upset that she's gone. I didn't even really say goodbye to her when they took her to Heidi's cause I wasn't thinking that it would be the last time I ever got to see her! So all I have left is a little lock of hair from the first time i cut it. I can't believe that I'll never get to hold her, or feed her carrots, or play with her, watch her swim in the pool, watch movies at night with her on my pillow, or watch her zoom around in circles in her cage like a crazy bat out of hell. She was so cute!!! I've cried so much the past day :'( It really pisses me off that people don't think guinea pigs are important just because they don't cost as much as cats and dogs, or cause they're not as big. For some reason people don't think you can get attatched to them which is definitely NOT true! I took Zoe EVERYWHERE with me! My brother's games, stores, friends houses, etc. I'm gonna miss her so much. I feel so bad that I wasn't there when it happened either. Heidi said she was running around in her cage really weird, and breathing really hard, then she just fell over. I hope it was quick and that she wasn't in any pain. Heidi left my a dozen red roses in my room and a sympathy card! She even said she would buy me another guinea pig! How sweet is she?! And she actually thought that I wouldn't want to be friends with her anymore! Watch out Kyle, I think you have some competition here...Heidi is sweet enough to buy me flowers and a card! I just might leave you for her! :)
I thought the whole thing with Amanda was done because she had no real argument, but I guess not. The same things were said, even though they were shot down and dissproved (sp?)in Kyle's entry. Oh well. I never asked her to read my journal to ""know"" me or to ""know"" anything about Kyle and I, so what does that have to do with anything?  No one cares where she goes to school, how many credits she has, that doesn't make a person. And the person that i got pissed at ONCE, wrote about nothing. There was no situation, he just wrote a mean comment that didn't have to do with anything. I must say it was REALLY funny to hear that she became ""concerned"" when I put Chris on my friends list, as if I was trying to have an ""affair"" with him, to dump Kyle for him, or even just to get into their business. I put him on there because i wanted to read his entries, as i do all my other ""friends"". WOO! Is there something wrong with that? I don't really care enough to bother with it anymore.
So, I REALLY miss Kyle and I can't wait to see him! I LOVE YOU KYLE!"

How is that supposed to make me feel. I'll do everything on the list she leaves me for the day, and yet she'll still find something to bitch about that i haven't done, or did slightly wrong. I haven't sat down ALL day until she came home, and then my mom starts flipping out becuase i put the corn in the inside garbage can instead of the outside can. So then she proceeds to tell me that if I don't stop giving her an attitude, I can't go anywhere tonight, nor can Kyle come over, just like she did to me last night. YAY! Not that I'm going to have anytime to see Kyle cause I'm sure he'll be hanging out with Craig all night, although I had plans with him today. I love how that works out. It's never fair. I'm such a high priority, yet everytime i want to see him, or I NEED him, like today, there's always something else first. It doesn't matter that I've been sitting here all day, crying, feeling like shit, the most depressed i've been in a long time. Don't worry though, i'll be fine. I've made it plenty of times without you, just thought maybe you could have made some time for me, but i guess the way i feel right now doesn't come under your god damn priority list. Sorry to fucking bother you! Well hope everyone is having a LOVELY FUCKING DAY! KISS MY ASS!"

"event","This is a reply for you AMANDA since I cannot write on your journal.

First of all, my name is spelled NickiE, just to clear that up.

No, I don't know a whole lot about you, just what I read in your journal. I did NOT judge you. I wrote that what you SAID was bitchy and mean, which it was, and I see nothing wrong with that. I never said that you were a horrible person, or that you were a bitch, or whatever. So that's not true.

As far as Kyle goes, I write everything in my journal. All the good and all the bad. I don't only write when I'm pissed off. If you have something to say about our relationship, go ahead. I never told you not to say anything, nor did I tell anyone else not to say anything. If you have a comment, make it. I write in my journal and I expect that people are going to reply to it, whether it be good or bad, and if i'm going to sit around and cry because someone said something i don't like, then i shouldn't write certain entries on my journal. As far as you and Chris go, I did NOT ONCE judge your relationship what-so-ever!  I never once said anything bad about your relationship, or anything between you and him. I only commented on what you wrote about the anniversary. If you have proof that I did, please let me know and I will apologize, because i NEVER meant to. I would also like to know how you think i'm being hypocritical????? You either don't know what that word means, or you're pulling some shit out of your ass.

I wrote what I wrote because Chris was REALLY upset the other night and I felt bad for him, that's all. I know him, and I know how excited he was to give you that necklace, I was there when he showed it to us.

No, i don't understand and i don't know how hectic the Rocketts are, I love them all.

You also say that you took off everyone's comments because the issue was between you and Chris only and no one else's opinion mattered. If that was really the case, why would you publicly post it, especially if you don't want to hear what everyone else has to say.

I'm not trying to be a bitch, but If you are going to accuse me of being hypocritical and judgmental, you better have something to back it up.

Oh, and you might want to use that AWESOME college education to learn how to spell."

Went to Kyle's tonight which was actually really cool! I actually just sat on his bed for 3 1/2 hours while they worked on RNO. It was awesome to see how they put everything together! I'm so glad that everything is all coming together for them, they've been working to hard on this for so long. I hope they do well and lots of people buy the DVD. I'm so proud of them! :-D Kyle's cousin Bethany came down from Maine so she hung out with us for a while too. Despite how I thought things were going to go because of past words, she was fucking awesome! She was really funny! I just hope it was all sincere ya know? Cause I don't want to look like an asshole.....Anyway. Tomorrow I'll be cleaning the kitchen floor for my mom and packing to go camping next week. We have A LOT of stuff! Hopefully I'll get to see Kyle for a while before I leave. I think it's going to be like 10 days without each other, lol. That's just AWFUL! :) Well, I'm exhausteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed.

I'm upset that I never got to do anything like be in the RNO video, or even just help film in general while they were running around pushing shopping carts or jumping out of trunks and pushing over porta-potties. Kyle never called me, and I just feel really left out that all his other really close friends got to be in it except me. And it's not that i'm being greedy like ""oh, well i didn't get to be in the spot light and have my 15 minutes of fame"".....it's more that I was so happy that they were doing this video and I was really excited to get to help them out and be part of it. Oh well. Nothing anyone can do about it now, it's over and done with. That doesn't mean I'm going to just get over it though.

Anyway, As you can see, I'm obsessed with lj icons lately. So fun! :)

My mom had my brother and I go to the grocery store for some things and we came home and had a big dinner. Heidi and I went to Starbucks and I feel bad cause both times I brought her, we haven't been able to get drinks :( I told her maybe tomorrow. My brother had a game tonight and we went, but it was raining and SO cold. I think I'm getting sick :( My temp is actually 99.9 right now and i'm freezing! We ended up losing the game 8-9. Not too bad, but it sucked having to sit out in the rain for it. After that we went to Buttonwood Farms for ice-cream. It was fun but I got WAY too much and of course I didn't finish :) Now we're home, and I might be going to Kyle's in a few minutes. I'm not sure though cause I really don't feel well.

"event","Ok, so I'm just going to do a quick update cause i'm exhausted! So, last night Kyle and I went to the Hanson/Maria Mena concert. It took us 4 hours to get there because there was so much traffic from the Boston Red Sox double header. Maria Mena rocked my fucking sox off, I LOVE HER!!! :) She was amazing. I would definitely go see her again! Hanson was really good too! The best part was that we got passes to go right up infront of the stage, (the part they have blocked off so crazy fans can't jump up on stage, although i probably should have, it would have been fun!) We got the passes to go up front cause they wanted us to be in Hanson's next music video for the song, ""Lost Without Each Other"". They've been filming at every concert, so i figured there's probably a slim chance that'll we'll actually get in the video. The song is actually about 2 people being in love, so when the camera was on us, I leaned over and gave Kyle a big kiss, hopeing that maybe it would boost our chances of getting on the video, LOL! :) After they sang they ran along the front and i got to touch their hands!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *drools* I LOVE them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't worry Kyle, no competition :) I love you the most! <3 We ended up getting home pretty early, and I spent the night at his house, WOO! Kyle had to work today so he brought me home around 1 and guess what?!?!?!?!!? There was a red car in the driveway, and I had no clue who it belonged to. We figured it was a rental car, that my mom had to have hers fixed and she was using it as a temporary. So, I asked her who's car was in the drive way when we got inside, and she threw the they keys at me!!!!! SHE BOUGHT ME A CAR!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH (well, i'm paying for it, but she bought it) I  had NO idea AT ALL! It was definitely the best suprise ever, especially on top of getting to touch Taylor's hand *swoon* lol It's a ""Candy Apple Red"" 98 Dodge Stratus. I LOVE IT! The paint isn't coming off, the trunk doesn't leak, the brakes don't squeak, the emergency brake works, the hood release works, the windshield wipes work, the speedometer works, there's a CD player (I haven't had one of those since i got my car 2 years ago!!!!!!!!!!) the doors don't stick, the glove box opens, the back left door lock isn't busted, and it even has brand new tires!!!!! I'm so stoked! I still can't believe that it's mine yet....hasn't sunk in. It only has 58,000 miles on it too!

Only two bad parts of the day were....

Adam stopped by professing his undying love for me again, practically cried cause i told him i wasn't breaking up with Kyle for him or anyone else, EVER. And he still continued to tell me that if Kyle and I ever break up, i can call him. Guess what? NOT GONNA HAPPEN! Get over it and leave me alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The worst news of the day..........

I didn't get into Avery Point. Now I have to decide wether I'm going to stay here or go to Florida :/ Anyone have any advice? Let me know cause I have to decide in the next few days :( 

Well, that's it for now. I'm exhausted and I'm going to bed. Hope everyone has a good night! 

<3 Always

I'm tired since I only got 1 hour of sleep last night, I guess I'll use that as my excuse to be a bitch. Although I'm sure Kyle would said that I don't have to be tired to be a bitch.

Went to court (it sucked) and I got my ticket dropped to $100. Not bad but it still sucks ASS! We had to sit in the courtroom for an hour before I got called. All the fucking criminals came in in their hand cuff and had chains on their feet. Pretty weird....some guy was arrested for carrying a pound of weed! How crazy is that?! He got off, no record, no fine, and i'm charged with $100! That's NOT fair!

"event","Wednesday - Kyle and I hung out most of the day. We went to Stop & Shop to pick up some Pizza bite things....the ones with the Pepperoni are the best! I bet Kyle is glad that I had him get the big bag....we ate the whole thing, and i'm sure he could have eaten more if we had them. We watched a movie while we ate them, though i can't remember what it was for the life of me.....lol House of Sand and Fog. We went to walmart to get it that night actually. We were looking for the shawshank redemption, but they didn't have it so we settled on house of sand and fog. It was a really good movie i thought, although it was very depressing at times. I would reccomened it though. Oh yea, I almost forgot. He bought me a long-stemed red rose. It was beautiful! I slept over that night....fun fun :)

Thursday - I hung out at home by myself and watched Die Hard With A Vengance. It was pretty good, my favorite out of the three.

Friday - I went to Kyle's around 12 at night, and he actually had a dozen roses for me. They were peach colored, so pretty :) It really made me feel better after the little ""argument"" we had that afternoon. We ended up hanging out for a little while but he was so tired i think he only last till 1am lol. And of course, again I stayed the night.

Saturday was SO much fun! I hung out with Kyle till 4:30 when he had to go to work. He ended up getting Shawshank Redemption at Strawberries so we watched that, had McDonalds for breakfast, and lets just say, maybe next time we shouldn't use so many bubbles! :) It was SOOOOO fun though! *kisses* Of course I guess I missed him for the whole 6 hours I hadn't seen him, so I went to starbucks at 10:30, and he asked me to come over when he got out around 12:30. I was suprised my mom actually let me leave that late... :) He had to work Sunday, so I just slept at his house till like 1, played with the dogs then i left.

Sunday - I went to the mall with Rusty and Heidi which was really cool. I bought a new bathing suit, and a movie. I didn't spend any money, and ended up with $8 more than i came with. How cool is that!? I'll let you figure that one out. I hung out by myself all night and watch Die Harder. I really liked that one and I would eventually like to buy all three on DVD since the ones i watched were my brother's and they're on VHS. Not bad, but i would like to have the DVDs. Anyway.....I think I finally fell asleep at 3 am. I was angry, so I didn't fall asleep for a while. I hate that about myself. No matter HOW tired i am, if i'm the least little bit upset, i CAN'T sleep, no matter how hard i try. It REALLY sucks!

Monday - Hung out all day by myself, then went to Kyle's at 11:30 after another stupid argument we had :( I hate fighting with him. He hates it when i'm mad at him, and i hate being mad at him!!! GRRR!! Sometimes he gives me reason to though, and other times i am just stupid and in a bad mood, and Kyle, I'm sorry for those times. Just know that I love you!!! I stayed over Monday night, and.....

Tuesday - Kyle treated me to a lovely picnic, and since we were both too lazy to make food, he bought us McDonalds. I think i already said it, but just incase i didn't, THANK YOU KYLE!!! We went to this little park by his house and sat on this bench in the shade. It was really sweet :) After that we worked on his music for the video and stuff, it was fun. We eventually ended up outside looking for 4 leaf clovers...i ended up finding 6, so he started to look with me and we ended up finding 22 TOTAL! How crazy is that?!?!? Maybe it's a good sign for us :)

So, I was thinking today, and I love how comfortable I am with him. I've never been so comfortable with anyone before. In every way possible too. Like, I'm not afraid to be myself around him. I'm sure he would agree with me on that one, and say that i burp and fart 10 times more than him.....although when he does, they are 10 times WORSE than mine! :)  I don't care if I don't put on make up or try to make myself pretty, cause he makes me feel pretty, even when i feel SO ugly, lol I think he makes me feel the most beautiful when i'm in my Pj's, my hair is a mess and i'm getting ready to go to sleep, or when i've just woken up. I can always tell by the way he smiles at me *sighs* Kyle ALWAYS has to have his tv or music on when he goes to sleep, and me on the other hand, i have to have it absolutly quiet. Any sort of noise distracts me and i can't fall asleep. It really sucks and I wish I didn't have to sleep with my stupid ear plugs every night, I HATE it, but i guess that's just the way I am. Anyway, the last few nights i've stayed over, he hasn't watched tv or had music on. It just made me smile tonight when I thought of it. It was so sweet of him, and I don't think I thanked him. So, Thank you Kyle! It really is appreciated! I think I've been looking past the REALLY little things, and they are what makes all the difference. I mean, it sucks that I didn't get anything for our anniversary, but what really matters is that I know he loves me. I don't need flowers, or cards, or jewelry, to know that Kyle loves me, although it definitely is a plus :) It's just nice to know that someone cares about you that much. No matter how much we fight, or yell, and get mad at each other, no matter what anyone else says, Kyle is the MOST PERFECT guy for me, and I don't ever want to lose him. He's taught me so much about myself. I had so much fun with him, even when I lived an hour and a half away in Rhode Island. I miss the times that he would come up and we'd spend a weekend together just hanging out. There are so many memories from that time, and it makes me kinda sad, i'm actually crying right now. I almost wish I still lived there now :( I'm glad that we made it through it though. I remember I used to get so sad when he would leave that i would just cry and cry and cry, and for a whole week, i would get so sad everytime i saw or did something that made me think of the weekend we had spent together. Cheesy huh? LoL! I love him SO much it drives me crazy sometimes!I know that I've hardly seen him lately and it really sucks, but that doesn't mean he doesn't love me. The times i've seen him this week have been so much fun. I think m favorite parts are when we're just sitting in his room, being silly. He is SO funny and can always make me laugh. It's amazing too, cause for the longest time, i never laughed, and it's just nice to know that there's someone who can make me smile and giggle once and a while. I just can't wait till the RNO stuff comes out and i finally get to see him a little bit more :)

Oh! I got my Maria Mena SIGNED CD in the mail today!!!! AHHH!! I'm so excited to go to the concert on Thursday with Kyle! Now tell me what guy would go to a Hanson concert with his girlfriend if he wasn't totally in love with her? :) Well, maybe it's just the sex, LOL Anyway, I love him, he's the sweetest! 

I LOVE YOU ALWAYS KYLE JOSEPH ROCKETT! <3 *kisses*"

"event","Looking back, i've been lied to quite a few times. I'm kinda annoyed by that. I mean, I'm supposed to have trust, and respect, treat people right, etc, but I don't get it in return. I may be in love, but i'm not happy anymore. I don't smile, I hardly laugh, there's always something wrong. 

I've been thinking a lot lately, and maybe it's best for me to just leave. I've talked with my cousin and my mom a lot lately, and i've come to a decision. If I'm not accepted to Avery Point, I'm going to move to Florida with Roxanne, Craig, Bella, and Matilda. I really think it's where I'd be the happiest. 

I'm tired of getting told how to feel, and i'm REALLY tired of bitches rubbing shit in my face! So, good for you! You have the perfect boyfriend. YAY! I'm happy for you, but there's no need to rub it in my face!

I get really sad now when I watch the wedding stories on TLC. Go ahead and make fun of me for watching it, but i'm a hopeless romantic. I believe in love at first sight, i believe that there is one special person out there for everyone, i believe in being able to find your soul mate at a young age, i believe in the fairy tale romance, and i especially believe, that if you really love each other, you're feelings will never fade, nor will the want to do little things, go on dates, talk on the phone, be silly, shower each other with gifts, etc. I thought I found him once. I believe there is someone perfect for me out there and i will find him, even if it takes forever.

Went the wrong way down a one-way street.
Runnin and runnin, keep on draggin my feet. 
Hasn't brought me anywhere but atleast i'm trying.
Sitting in my room all alone and crying.
No you, you haven't done nothin at all.
So sleep soundly, cause i'd like to watch as you fall."

I got a card 1 month later.
I got a rose 2 months later cause I bitched and asked for it about 8,000 times!!!!!!!!!

And that's supposed to make it ALL better.

I did stuff and bought you things on ALL of our ""anniversaries"". I know you didn't have a lot of money because things were tight. I didn't care that I didn't get anything, but I thought I would atleast have had a nice 1 year anniversary.

"event","So, after 3 months, i'm really sick and tired of having to see the short end of the stick, EVER day! I'm tired of being last and getting squezed into Kyle's schedule for only a few hours a WEEK! In the past month, i think i've had maybe 3 quality days with him. RNO has been taking up all of his time, and now, when there are a few hours i get to see him, the plans all revolve around the dog. Can't do anything or go anywhere cause we have to stay with the dog. I'm TIRED OF GETTING SHAFTED! I saw him on Wednesday and now i'm not going to see him until NEXT THURSDAY, and that's only because I made plans over a month ago! I'd like him to make the plans once and a while. Ask me to hang out for two, even three days in a row. That's not gonna happen, and when i do get asked to hang out, it's cause i BITCH about not getting to see him, so he kindly makes a few hours to see me. WOO! It's like he makes his plans with Craig for the week, and then calls me to say, oh, i can squeeze you in for 2 hours before i have to go to work on saturday if you want to hang out, Or, you can tag along with us to this place if you want, but really, i don't have time for you until next week. I thought maybe I'd get to see him tonight since i've been alone EVERY Friday night since i can remember, or maybe a little bit on Sunday night. Nope, he's already got plans. There's always all these reasons why I have to get put on hold for a little while, but ""it's not always gonna be like this"". Well, there's always something, and i'm just wondering what's next. Granted you have other priorities and other responsabilities, doesn't mean i should get put on hold till you're done with it all. It's not fair to me, and i shouldn't have to do that. Like I said, I have feelings too and you can't just push me around like that and expect me to stay. I'm trying to be very understanding of everything that's going on in his life right now, but it doesn't seem like he's willing to do the same for me. It's not like he's even TRYING to make time for me, everything and everyone else comes first and has come first for a LONG time now. And you know what? I don't care if I sound like some selfish bitch. If me wanting to spend more then a few hours a week with my fucking boyfriend makes me selfish, then so be it! I'm the most selfish bitch out there. And just like Kyle said, maybe there IS someone better for me. Someone that will make time for me, LOVE me like i love him, treat me like i treat him, show me the same respect that i have for him (like refraining from lying in bed with other girls!), do LITTLE THINGS for me without me having to ASK for it 8,000 times first!(like a rose here and there, like I have done for you MANY times). I wanna feel LOVED, CARED ABOUT, IMPORTANT, SPECIAL, BEAUTIFUL, etc. Maybe I should start looking cause I would give ANYTHING to feel better than I feel and have felt lately. Maybe I should take a vote.....too bad I know what the answer is, I just don't listen to anyone. Maybe it's time I start listening to my head instead of my heart because so far, it hasn't gotten me anywhere good. Hope everyone has a LOVELY FUCKING DAY!

Maybe i'll take up the option to go to Olive Garden to night with a special friend from way back when. Atleast someone wants to spend some time with me :)"

I had a pretty boring day.....watched some t.v. did some chores, finished digging the fire pit and pulled out a 200lb rock. Yea, that was the fun part. Heidi fell in the rock and cut her hand open, yucky! I felt so bad for her though, she fell really hard and if it was me, i would have cried. I think she would have if i wasn't there. Anway, the 3 of us went to the beach concert tonight. It was pretty cool. My cousin was there so we talked to him for a little bit. After that we went to Dairy Queen, came home, and i pretty much haven't done anything since then. I just finished watching Die Hard With A Vengeance. It was pretty cool, but i'm really tired now. Oh yea! Avery Point JUST got my fucking transcript from CCRI, so i still won't be hearin from them for another week or two. Other than that, I talked to Tommy for a little bit today and we might get together this weekend. Adam is bothering me about how he loves me and wishes he hadn't fucked up our relationship (over 4 years ago, when i was 15!!!!) He wants to go out to dinner and hang out and stuff, keeps telling me i'm beautiful, and he's really sorry. He loved me and he's never felt the same way about anyone since then, and wishes he didn't fuck up. Well, sorry, it sucks to be you. Oh, and I got my paycheck. $90 for working 6 hours. Woo! Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings. Goodnight."

"event","So I found a box downstairs, one that I had forgotten to bring up after I had finished moving back into my room in early May. As I was going through it, I stumbled across a bunch of old letters Kyle had written me. I read through them and started to cry. It seemed like we were unstoppable back then. We were in love, and nothing nor anyone, could ever come between us. He'd written me a bunch of letters to take with me when i went on my cruise, and when i went camping with my dad. I was supposed to open one each night and I never cheated either :) Being the dork that I am, I had highlighed my favorite things that he said to me in them. There were a lot of highlighs back then, just in one letter. It seems to be getting harded to find those highlighed words, moments, or doings anymore. I feel so lost now, I just want to get back to where I was before. Happy, content, safe, and loved......really really loved.


Anyway, onto a, well, not so much better note.....I might have to take Zoe to the vet tomorrow :'( I was holding her at the kitchen table, and she just shot right up over my shoulder and fell onto the heater and then onto the floor. She cried SO loud! I felt so bad, almost like a mom. I would have done anything to take away her pain. You had to have heard the way she cried, it was awful. The worst part was when i heard her hit the floor. I almost didn't want to turn around and look :( I'm worried that she may have hurt her spine, or one of her legs. We'll see how she's doing tomorrow. She is my pride and joy, I love her SO much, more then anything, and i would do anything for her! She's so cute, she's my baby.

Well, I guess Kyle will be here in another hour or so......I hope everyone had a good day :'("

"event","So, I guess one of my recent posts was a bunch of bull shit. Yea, thing are changing and we're doing great! *rolls eyes*

We were supposed to go camping this week. Today through Thursday. I found out we weren't going a week before, and because i wasn't told sooner, when ""he"" found out, my $100 was wasted, I can't get it back. 

So then, as soon as he finds out we're not going anymore, ""he's"" made plans with everyone else. I thought maybe he'd try and make it up or something by going camping in his yard like he said, but apparently there are other priorities. We had plans to hang out today, then all of a sudden, he's hanging out with Craig, and he didn't think it would overlap his hang out with ME time. Then it's, oops, i forgot i was hanging out with Craig the whole day. Then it's, yea, i've had plans with him since the second i found out we weren't going camping. I don't know what to believe anymore, but i'm really pissed off.

No offense to Craig what so ever, but Kyle took Monday nights off just to hang out with you, I don't have shit! I see him one night, and then i don't see him for another 2 or 3 days! I don't care that you guys hang out, you're best friends and you're working on the RNO thing. I'm just tired of getting fucking shafted, walked over, and stabbed in the back, and i'm just supposed to sit back and keep taking it because he apologizes.

You're gonna make this up and that up, you're gonna do this and do that. I haven't seen shit! I still haven't even gotten an anniversary present! And Kyle KNOWS i'm NOT being a greedy bitch when i say that, because we've had the conversation about 8,000 times since May 21st! I get the, I'm sorry i'm such a horrible person, i'm sorry i'm a bad boyfriend, i'm sorry i'm such a jerk, i'm sorry i'm an asshole, etc., Although I haven't seen anything to prove otherwise. Nothing changes and nothing gets fixed, i just keep getting the apologies. So if you're not going to fix the things that you've fucked up, don't bother apologizing. It's great that you can realize when you fuck up and apologize to me. YAY! I'm just sick and tired of having to hear it EVERY TIME i see you! I don't see how things are changing and getting better if you keep having to apologize for things.

I don't think I'm being some clingy bitch either. Writing is my way of venting, the only way i can ""talk"" without being interrupted. Oh, so you all think i should be talking to Kyle about this instead of writing on my livejournal? Yea, well, i would have to agree with you on that one but it doesn't really work out that way. Try getting a hold of him. I don't get to talk to him until 1am every night, and by that time he's too damn tired to talk about anything. He needs to go to sleep. I see him about 2 times a week, and those times a partially ruined by my trying to talk about how i feel. Then i realize that since i only see him twice a week, i should just let it go and try to enjoy my time with him, although that proves to be a lot harded. How are you supposed to be enjoying time with someone when you have so much shit on your mind. God forbid I should be able to see him more than 1 day or a few hours in a row. That would just be awful. I'm not some bitch who's asking to be your number one priority, but i do feel like i'm the VERY LAST on the list of important things. And there is NOT one good reason why i shouldn't feel that way! It's not like we've only been together 2 months, it's been a long time, and i feel completely disrespected, taken for granted, and unappreciated.

I'm not going to sit around and take this shit anymore. I have feelings too and I don't deserve to get treated like this. I've been nothing but nice, and tried to work things out. It's like he thinks i'm a fucking boomerang! Keep throwing me away, and i'll keep coming back! Well, keep throwing me away, and one of these days i'm just not going to come back.

I'm unhappy and it really sucks. You were unhappy. I took some time to myself to think about things and where we were going. I realized that there were things i was doing wrong, things that needed to be fixed because it was causing you to be unhappy. So, i fixed them, i've changed, not just for you, but for myself too. And i as a person feel so much happier, so much better. But as far as our relationship goes, i'm not happy. So why should i change to make you happy, if you're not willing to do the same for me? It's not a one way street!

I'm not going to sit around in the back of your life until you're done with your priorities and then have some time for me. That's not fair. That's not how a relationship works. What haven't i done for you? What haven't i given up for you? Why should i let you treat me like this? Right. I shouldn't. I'm done, I'm out."

"event","So, last night, i must say, was the best night i've ever had in a long time. Kyle and I hung out when he got out of work, and even though it took him about 40 minutes to put the damn mirrors on his jeep, it was cool. We kinda just hung out in his room and talked, and laughed, A LOT. I think my favorite part was that we just sat around talking and laughing. It's been a long time since i've been that content and that happy. I wish i could just go back and keep doing it over and over.

I've definitely noticed a big change, which i have to say, i'm very proud of myself. I said there were things i was going to fix, and i'm doing it! It just feels good to know that.....i don't know, i just feel really good about myself lately. I mean, if an issue comes up, we talk about it. I don't get as mad as I used to and he doesn't push my buttons like crazy! It's just so amazing to me how much I feel we've accomplished. I really had the best time last night! Thing just felt so differnt between us, I can't even describe it. Well, I'm off to visit him at Starbucks and then to my brothers baseball game VS. Ledyard. We're gonna kick their asses!

I love you Kyle!!! And I hope you weren't too late to work this morning, although it was your fault ;)"

It's much better than me trying to explain it anyway, and if i did, i would probably come off sounding like a bitch, so i'll just let the lyrics do the explaining..............



Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real 
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cos I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

More than words

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cos I'd already know"

It's funny when my cousin, whom i see maybe 2 or 3 times a year, noticed that i've had my hair done, but my own father who sees me atleast once a week, wouldn't even notice if i dyed my hair RED, HAHA! And my cousins new nickname for me is Rainbow Bright! :)

I hate when you want someone to say or do something, and you wait around and wait around for them to say, or do it, and they don't. So, you casually bring it to their attention that you would appreciate it if they did or said this.....and then you wait, and wait, and still......NOTHING! Boys are so funny that way....


Anyway, we're having a big family dinner tonight. YAY. Me, Rusty, my mom and JIM! Then we're going to Rusty's baseball game vs. Tri-County. It should be a nice ass kickin'! Woo! Well, i'm having a good day, and i hope everyone else is! I LOVE YOU GUYS! HeHeHe"

"event","What a shitty day. I woke up at 12 and just felt like crying for some reason. Who knows anymore. My brother is supposed to have a game tonight, but i'm not sure cause of the rain. That will give me nothing to do tonight, YAY! I'm supposed to be going groccery shopping for my mom i guess, again. Oh well.

Yesterday was awesome! Sarah and I went to my grandma's and ate lots of lobster! We went crabbing with hot dogs (lol) and we actually ended up catching a bunch! One of them was pregnant, pretty weird....
We went to Starbucks to see Kyle, and I ended up leaving my purse there so we had to go back again! We ended up all piling into Rustys truck...all 5 of us.....a little bit too squished for me....but anyway, we went to Walmart and bought a bunch of fireworks for $47. The lady didn't really know hoe to count, because it was supposed to come to around $56! I wasn't about to complain though. So we picked up Chris and went back to my grandma's where the six of us (Me, Sarah, Chris, Rusty, Heidi, and J.J.) lit ot all the fireworks. It was actually a lot of fun, and at the end we lit off 12 Piccolo Petes at the SAME time! It was SO fucking loud! After that i came home and saw Kyle for about an hour, he left early because he was tired.......

So anyway, I'm kinda pissed off. I've had plans to go camping in Vermont with Kyle for about 8 months. It's already been paid for, i bought a brand new $100 tent, and a $40 air mattress. So i'm all excited to go, and then i'm informed that we can't go because Kyle's mom wants him to drive her to the airport. So now i've bought all this stuff, made all these plans (EIGHT MONTHS AGO!), and now that it's being canceled, i can't even get my money back because it's too late. So there goes $100 out the window, which i DEFINITELY cannot afford to be ""throwing"" away right now. It's not like we can reschedule it for another week this summer either. I called to make the reservations the day they opened back in January, and they were already almost booked! I called the day after that to make reservations for my dad, and they didn't even have anything! I'm just so pissed because i have to keep sacraficing my plans and stuff. The wedding, our anniversary, and now camping. HaHaHa! It's not like someone is going to just give me my $100 back, which would be really nice since i'm not the one who canceled the trip at the last minute....oh well. IT'S NOT FAIR! Just my luck. 

Well, I hope everyone else has a nice day!"

"event","i absolutly HATE waking up feeling like shit. Emotionally that is. There's a knot in my stomach the size of fucking Texas and i'm just sitting here crying. I feel like i'm going to burst i'm so angry! So much shit has happened since Friday, and although apologies have been thrown around, i still don't feel any better. And I also don't feel like there is any effort being made to make it better. I mean, so 'you' apologize. It still doesn't take away what happened or erase it from my memory. If it was that fucked up, why did 'you' do it in the first place? UGH! Why did you DO something like that, when it's something you'd be FURIOUS with me for and unbelievably HURT by if I ever did anything like that to you!?!?!?! It's NOT fair! Maybe I'm not making sense to anyone else, I don't know. I guess the only thing i know is that i feel like shit, walked all over, and stabbed in the back for the....who knows what time. Well, i hope everyone else has a good day and just maybe i will too.






Wakin' up this mornin' thinkin' this can't be real
They say there is nothin' love can't heal
Why don't you come on down so you can feel what I feel
Just sittin' all alone in this place
Even though we're here face to face
There is nothin' gone, but there's somethin' wrong

Now, I know what to say, but don't know where to begin
I fear I'm losing you beneath my skin
What is the resolution for this pain that I'm in
Is sittin' all alone in this place"

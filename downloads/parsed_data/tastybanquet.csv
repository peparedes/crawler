"event","i got the envelope in the mail today giving me my results on my certification exam. i was terrified to open it, but i managed to talk myself into it, anyways. i was totally sure i failed both the state and national exams, and completely and utterly shocked when i saw i had passed both. so shocked, that i even cried when i saw it. now, i'm just shaky and have butterflies in my stomach. i still can't believe that i passed both the exams. i keep looking at the letter and rereading it thinking i was wrong when i read it the first time. (and the second.. and third... and fourth. you get what i'm saying.) i keep thinking that theres some sort of illusory type enchantment on the letter and that the next time i look at it i'll see smoke come across it and the letters will all rearrange to confirm that i am indeed, a failure. but it hasn't so far. i think i'll save this letter. since i'm so excited about it. and as proof in case later on i receive another one telling me it was a mistake or something. :P
i have to send off a check to pay for the certificate to be issued. i'm really excited about the whole thing in general. what a great thing to wake up from a nap and find out. :)

""You are a WEDF--Wacky Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a menace to society, depending on how you channel your energies. You chew your fingers and have an addictive personality. Properly guided, you can be enormously productive--otherwise you run amok, stir up trouble, and generally have a hell of a good time.

To your friends, you are a source of relentless entertainment. You often get into trouble, but you almost always find a way out. You are strangely popular and feed off others' energy. You live hard, seize the day, and although your more sober friends would like to see you settled down, you generally have fewer regrets and better memories than they do. Your tenet is that, at the end of the day, one regrets only what one didn't try. You are right.

You could benefit from outside help in balancing your highs and lows. Or perhaps cutting back on the caffeine."""

"event","it's said that you can tell if a dog will survive parvo by what their progress is on the fourth day of treatment. if they make it through that far and are getting slightly better, they're good to go. :)
day 2 is going well so far. i'm very pleased with how well punky is doing. she even got to eat some tonight. shes fighting off the nasty bugs well and seems to be doing great. if she holds down her tiny dinner overnight tonight she may be able to come home tomorrow!
*happy dance*
i'm still sick. congested and swollen and sniffly. but i'm on nyquil. so i'll live."

"event","its too soon for this. i'm not ready to lose another pet. maybe i'm just not meant to have a new dog. maybe punky was meant for someone else. maybe she just isnt meant to be. at all. it isnt fair. i vaccinate my dogs. i take every precaution against diseases and viruses. i've secluded her from the outside world.
i have no clue. i'm so sick feeling right now. i woke up feeling like i just came down with a head cold or tonsil infection or something and this day just hasnt got any better.
i wanna start over. i wanna wake up. i dont like this dream. i wanna start over.
i dont wanna go into the office to take care of her again tonight. i'm terrified i'll find her lifeless body there. i'm so scared she wont live through this. its such an ugly ugly disease. and we're only at the beginning.
at least we got it early, right?

i've not felt well today. feeling kinda blah all over. oh, and pumping myself full of cranberry juice (thanks, mom!) in order to try and stave off what seems to be an upcoming kidney infection or kidney stone. :(
i have to work early in the morning, but i can't seem to get myself to fall asleep. there's neet movies on my cable tv. its amazing what a payment to the cable company can fix.
i was really glad to see ivy, chris, and the two cutest nieces in the world yesterday. it was also really nice to hang out with them for a bit, even though ivy was all doped up from her eye surgery that day. i was especially glad to see brooke and sierra. brooke is talking now! and ohsovery cute! and sierra is just hillarious. very fun to be around.
nothing else really exciting is going on. a few friends are coming over tomorrow night after i'm offa werk. thats neet.
they fired someone at my work, and two other people finished out their final days with us this week also. its been really crazy. and its only going to get worse from here.
thats all for now. this weekend's goal = numbness."

"event","i'm updating because jen told me to. :) i don't know how long this will be because i don't really have much to say. and i wanna go to bed. i'm really tired. it has been a long day.
my little brother was admitted to the hospital today. they think he has an abscess behind his tonsil. his tonsil is so inflamed, it's almost completely covering his trachea. they've got him on iv fluids and antibiotics and are going to decide if it needs surgery tomorrow. he has been feeling pretty shitty since yesterday, having trouble swallowing, a sore throat and fever ranging between 102 and 103. when it continued today, mom set him up an appt with his physician. when he was at the dr's office they told my dad to take him to the ER because of the severity of his condition. last i heard the children's ward was full so they put him in a room on the adult floor and are waiting to see what happens with him tomorrow. so yeah...
bo has been really good. no acting out, no peeing in the house. (she was having a real problem with that before and i'm wondering if she didn't do it because she wanted more attention...) i've been leaving her at the 'rents house when i'm gone, to give her time to be with other dogs. i know she misses amber. i can see it in her eyes. she looks around sometimes and looks for her, too. the 'rents say she totally freaks out and cries and whines and acts like a nut (like way worse than normal. to the extent that the first time it happened, they thought something might've been wrong with her. well, physically wrong. not mentally. we already know she's crazy.) when she sees that i've come home. it almost seems like she thinks i'm abandoning her every time i leave her there. maybe she thinks i abandoned amber somewhere, too. i don't know. either way, she's excited to go there every morning, and i'm glad for her to have company while i'm gone.
i got amber's ashes back from the crematorium on friday. the urn is very nice. very tasteful. it almost doesn't even look like an urn. just like a thick portrait frame. i'm happy with it, but i still have yet to take her urn out of the box and put it somewhere i want to keep it. as of this moment, the cardboard box containing her cremains resides on my coffee table, waiting for me to set it up elsewhere. i think keeping it beside my bed is a good idea. a few people suggested it to me, as it was her place to sleep. and it seems fitting since she's now sleeping. i don't want to put her there on the dirty dusty nightstand. i need to clean it off, throw some old water bottles and soda cans away, and wipe it down first.
the cremation service people came today to our office to do their weekly pickup. i did pretty well not being upset until i went outside and saw their pickup with the bed full of colored bags. it just broke my heart thinking about amber having been in there.
for the most part, i think i'm doing okay. i'm not hysterical. i'm not as unpredictable emotionally. but i still cry a few times a day, and i still miss her like hell. my heart aches to hold her again. to smell her, touch her soft fur and tell her how very much she means to me. but i'm comforted to know she's at peace. and that she doesn't have to hurt anymore. i think having her ashes home now is helping me a lot, too. i was really upset having her away from me. and even though i KNOW that its just ashes in that little box, its her. part of my baby. and i felt like i was disrespecting her and abandoning her by her not being here with me. i know it sounds stupid. and i know her spirit isn't in the little box. but thats just how i feel about it.
i was talking to a friend the other day and telling her how amber used to cry when i left for school when i was a kid. in the most recent years, she's always just slept in her bed in the living room near the front door until i came home. that really clicked with me after we talked about it. i know she's just sleeping now. sleeping until i come home and we can be together again.
i cant think of anything else to talk about, really. i had a weird work day. it was almost like i was there but i wasn't. came home and make a few steaks over at the 'rents place. now i'm here. and i think its my bed time."

The Big Five is currently the most accepted personality model in the scientific community. The Big Five emerged from the work of multiple independent scientists/researchers starting in the 1950s who using different techniques obtained similar results. Those results were that there are five distinct personality traits/dimensions. Here are your results on each dimension:



Extroversion results were medium which suggests you are moderately talkative, optimistic, sociable and affectionate. 

Friendliness results were moderately high which suggests you are good natured, trusting, and helpful but possibly too much of a follower 

Orderliness results were moderately low which suggests you tend to be unreliable, lazy, careless, and unmotivated. 

Emotional Stability results were moderately low which suggests you are worrying, insecure, emotional, and nervous. 

Intellectualness results were moderately high which suggests you are creative, original, curious, imaginative but possibly not very practical."

"event","i feel like shit. and yet, even as i realize this, i feel like i don't know how or what to feel anymore. it just doesn't seem worth it to try anymore.
my head is so very puffy and hurtful. i just want to crawl into my bed and hibernate until everythings okay and theres no more hurt.
please listen carefully because i only want to say this once. i'm not saying it to try and get attention or sympathy. it just seems so much easier to type it out then to call everyone and update them over the phone. i don't want to keep telling the story over and over again. it only makes me more upset and makes my eyes hurt more. as it is now, it feels as though someone shoved their envelope openers into my eyes and proceeded to pour lemon juice down the long blade. please know that although i appreciate your sympathy and condolences, right now talking about it and hearing those words make me hurt more. i'm just not ready to accept it all yet. once it's all okay in my head, i'll be able to talk about it. i think it's just going to take some time for me to work through my thoughts on it.
i took molly mcnoodle to the ultrasound specialist today. it was as we had feared. she was in the final stages of kidney failure. her kidneys were so small, that it was near impossible for the specialist to even recognize them. but alas, he's the best, and thats why i went to him. he assumed from her appearance, age, blood results and condition that she had some sort of congenital defect making her kidneys smaller in size and more prone to inefficiency. then she got into something that caused them to shrink even smaller in size and stop functioning. he said normally if this was the beginning of it, he would recommend treatment with antibiotics, steroids, and fluid therapy. then recheck her blood work and see how it looks in a few days. since we've done all that, and the blood work was only showing her kidneys to be worse. he then recommended taking her home to say goodbye and then taking her into work in the morning to end it.  i came home, sobbing the whole way, and talked to matt between hysterical bawling. if left in this condition she would inevitably die. and it would only get more painful throughout the night. the only option i was okay with was taking her into work and ending it now.
so here i am... one hour after she looked up into my eyes for the last time and cuddled up against my face almost as if reassuring me of my decision. i kissed her on her head, told her i loved her, would miss her, and that she'd be all better soon. then she sighed in relief.
god i miss her. so very much."

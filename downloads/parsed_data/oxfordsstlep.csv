"event","ok. well um...? iunno. u can prolly tell im having a harder time expressing myself on here. but well...iunno. life...has been ok. good and bad. take the good, learn from the bad. :D lol. wat am i? a fortune cookie? lol. but its true. ive been incredibly happy, sad, and TOTALLY out of it. sry christian :D lol. and i keep disapearing on people. anna's brothers hissing at her, i mean her dog. lol so i guess im in a good mood right now, but its liable to change. im well...i feel bad about some things that i cant say on here. but i really respect my friends. and i...well im really grateful for all of them. i really love you guys and you have no idea. whether you care, or not. or even ready to embrace that fact. i honestly love you guys. and i hope you all know that. because you guys know who i am and i want everyone else to know that too. u guys have helped me find who i am, and more importantly let me show myself to people. and i love talking to you, and growing up with you. i was listening to a song and i kept thinking about well..things. life in highschool with you guys. it wouldnt be anywhere near as good without you. so while im being such a looser, let me say one more thing. i dont expect anything in return, besides, im not very good at recieving love back. i just know how to give it. but i do love you all. and i hope you know that. 

ok im done. i think. :D see you at school tomorow
TAG TOMOROW!"

"event","cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say
about the things caught in my mind
and as the day is dawning my plane flew away
with all the things caught in my mind

and I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
and I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground

so don't go away
say what you say
but say that you'll stay
forever and a day in the time of my life
'cause i need more time
yes, i need more time, just to make things right

damn my situation and the games i have to play
with all the things caught in my mind
damn my education i can't find the words to say 
about the things caught in my mind

and I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
and I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground

so don't go away
say what you say
but say that you'll stay
forever and a day in the time of my life
'cause i need more time
yes, i need more time, just to make things right

me and you what's going on?
all we seem to know is how to show the feelings that are wrong

so don't go away
say what you say
but say that you'll stay
forever and a day in the time of my life
'cause i need more time
yes, i need more time, just to make things right

"event","does anyone look at something and go ""that is life""? no, not one person. *sigh* and that makes me sad. i believe that people are now blind...blind to life. generations of evolution has taken away our site. I wish i could show people how /i/ see things. but it would be pointless. a blind man will never see again...at least not in the same way. But its sad. because if people could see life would there be all the problems of today? crime? war? hatred? life wasnt created so we could destroy it. life is ironic. i dont think the world understand the irony. just like living is one big joke that no one finds funny anymore. im just trying to live, laugh, and enjoy. life is for living.

PROTEST! haha. but it was funny cuz the guy at the registers like ""we're gonna need more shake mix...a LOT more shake mix"" it was FUNNY! but christian had to leave early :( but it was still fun talking to mary rose and meghan. theyre pretty cool. lol. missed ya though twinnie!"

"event","That college boyfriend I talked about yesterday....... I talked to him today. lol I do miss the fun times we had together. Wow I was wild back then! But we did have fun. Driving though a river and getting stuck in the middle of it, and having to stand on the seats to stay out of the water. Running out of gas in the boat on the lake. Chocolate chip cookies ;). A long drive in the BMW. Hanging out at the coast guard station. Lots of fun :)"

"event","Why can't I trust? Well lets see..... There was that boy I dated in high school. He was wonderful we rodeoed together. Traveled together, he was funny and made me laugh. I was the state queen and he was an all around cowboy. Then we went to the high school national finals. I thought that was going to be the best week both of us at nationals, cowboy prom, and his LQ and my friends RV (who I was stying with) were parked right next to each other it was going to be great.....I thought. Untill the very first day we were there he walked up to me with another barrel racer, broke up with me, put his arm around her and walked away!!! Knife to the heart!

Then there was my good friend all through high school who I always had a crush on. When I moved to Fallon for school he was in Reno. We started hanging out more just me and him, having a good time. I really liked him, and of course he filled my head with crap that made me like him more. Then I found out he was also seeing my BEST FRIEND back in vegas! Really!? JERK!

How about the amazing boyfriend I had in college. He was great made me laugh harder then I ever had. He pretty much lived at my house, his clothes in my closet, toothbrush on the sink, his broken down truck in my garage, all his stuff was there. mmmmmm I do miss him, everything was quite amazing, and I mean everything ;)pretty much the best ever! Then I came home from a rodeo and called him to see where he was. That when I heard the girls giggling in the back ground. I went to meet him. and he decided that he was going to marry his ex so he could make more money. He was in the coast guard. Great guy right?

Oh and how about the the guy that broke up with me in a text on my 21st Bday nice huh? or the one that broke up with me on Valentines day? Or the reacent one.... Haven't seen him in years, lives in another state, we start talkin, he askes me to come visit. He likes me I like him blah blah blah. Then a few weeks later tells me he has a GF. Really?!

And just to be clear on WHO im talking about their names are: Kyle, Cody, Shaun, Travis, Dustin, Jason"

"event","I am super excited for the end of August to come. My friend Kris is coming to Vegas from Texas! I can't wait to see him :) at least I have one good thing to look forward to. Well that and I get to go to the Shakespeare festival in Cedar City and stay at this nice little B&amp;B. I have become obsessed with that TV show Brothers and Sisters. I started watching it on Netflix so I can catch up before next season. I really like that show but I think maybe I'm watching it a little too much. I started having dreams about the show haha. That's the one thing I really love about sleeping..... Dreaming, my dreams are so much better that real life that the minute I wake up I'm already depressed that I have t go on with real life. This really sucks. I really wish I could Just move away and start over :/&nbsp; 

I want to go to the lake. It's already July and I haven't even been in a pool yet!! Well Monday in the 4th of July so BBQ, pool, drinks and good friends will be in order!"

I got to sit and talk to one of the band members from Fourthmorning he was cool. Then yesterday my friend and I went to a haunted house and it was too cold to be Tinkerbell so I put blood all over my face and vampire teeth in and I had fake blood in my mouth (it tasted really good) Then we went back to my house and watched House Of Wax witch wasn't very good other than Paris Hilton dieing. anyways, thats about it for my Halloween."

When Ryan and I were at the mall the other day we were in Hot Topic and I decided to get bigger earrings. I went a whole size bigger! (I'm being sarcastic). Anyway I went to an 18 gauge. I really like them. Ryan just laughs at me. :) Now I can't wait to go to a 16. This is addicting! I'm going to a big barrel race in AZ on Saturday. I hope I come home with some money! I'm taking Ryan to get his lip re-pierced on Thursday. He is so hott with his lip pierced! I Love Him! He He He. Well I'm thinking of dyeing my hair all red. I kinda like it. I think it will scare all the people in Fallon. I'm going to see My Chemical Romance In Reno on October 3rd and Green Day in Vegas on the 6th. Ryan is going with me to Green Day. I want Ryan to move to Fallon with me so bad! He says he might next semester. I hope so I'm going to miss him so much. :("

"event","Well things seem to be going my way. I have a beautiful boyfriend who I love dearly. My horses are doing great. College rodeos are getting ready to start. School is starting, so that means I have to go back to Fallon :( that makes me so sad I'm going to miss Ryan more than anything. Well the semester is only 15 weeks and I'll be coming back to visit. This summer was one of the best summers I'v had but I'm definitely ready to go back to my own house! Living with the parents is HORRIBLE!!!! I never thought I would fall in love so quickly but I did. The first time I saw Ryan I said WOW! But that was it, we hated each other the rest of the day. Isn't that funny? By the second day I didn't want to leave his side. And now we are completely head over heels in love with each other. Things are great."

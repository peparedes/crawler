"event","This song was a long time coming.  Complete with guitar, singing bowls, tribal drums, trumpet, tambourine and voice.  One of these days I promise you'll get to hear it.
Anyhow so.. this is based on events from a couple of years ago.  I had pretty much forgotten about it all until a month ago and I realized how funny, sad and way-out-of-left-field all that was.  The song honestly sounds like Johnny Cash meets Queen.  I tried to capture the state of mind I was in which musically sounds like a sad circus of clowns winding down with a beer and a cigar after the show is over feeling totally wiped out.   Clowns meaning.. myself and others being clowns.
Some of you will know exactly of what I'm singing of.  Keep Me Alive serves here as a plea and also as a mantra to oneself.


KEEP ME ALIVE

It's the wrong town for me.
It's the wrong kind you see.
Take me down to the station.
Don't even bother with the I Ching.

For a man you deserve nothing more.
For a girl you deserve nothing less.

It's the same, oh it's the same, it's the same ol story.
No, You don't even know how hard I try to Keep Me Alive.

We met at the house today.
To discuss this infidelity.
I've painted over all the walls.
To comply with my 6th sense call.

For a boy you are so naive.
A little girl you will always be.

It's the same, oh it's the same, it's the same ol story.
No, You don't even know how hard I try to Keep Me Alive.

You believe you have a friend.
I saw your car in the driveway.
We were decorating the tree,
faking praise for some new born king.

Today, I deserve something more.
Today, I want a love of my own.

It's the same, oh it's the same, it's the same ol story.
No, You don't even know how hard I try to Keep Me Alive.

You don't even know how hard I try.
No, you don't even know how hard I try..
to Keep Me Alive.
Keep Me Alive.
Keep Me Alive."

This is also a piano work.

She sits there with her cigarette 
watching the birds.
Wiping the table off she says
she could never do it.

He steals and buries out in the yard
his and her life savings.
Got a candy cabinet full of chocolate
and notes from the doctor.

(chorus)
But they don't know much about love.
They don't know anybody else..
who's had it this hard
who's had it this time.
She wants the ocean.
Her Last Horizon.

I used to see her leave food
for the children.
They came to see her every morning,
running through the roses.

These ashes on the table 
are soon to be me 
she says it's never easy to leave 
when your hungry.

(chorus)

(she says) It's never been easy for me
to cry in the rain.
It's like a picture show movie,
a tear-jerker-horror flick.

I don't want to have my life
like my savings.
Buried under the dirt.
Buried under the cold.

(chorus)

She wants the ocean, her Last Horizon
without a license to drive west."

"event","I started this song last year in a Hendrix College practice room in Conway, AR.  I didn't feel inspired to finish it until last week.  This is originally and currently just on piano.

Pinky Hold..
Next stop, promise you'll know.

In the dark state living here.
Fear
Fear
Fear
Invisible denial.

Long Road..
Pulled over, temporary runaway. Run away.

Sound the trumpet loud and clear.
Beer
Beer
Beer
The beer-bitch is sleepwalking.

(chorus)
Smoking Chester, raise the window.
A buffet waitor never gets a proper show.


My father's cold.
Next stop, promise you'll know.

In this house, living here.
Tears
Tears
Tears
Put your nose right there.

My mother's bold.
You can't cry on your birthday.

Hear the voices, feel the rush.
Kill
Kill
Kill
Your pain with my love.

"event","This is the song I wrote on Mike's birthday this year on Oct. 15th.  I didn't realize I had written the song on his birthday until the next day. It's short, but the music and all is very slow.
_______________________________________________

You showed me the seashells on the wall.
I knew that morning I had to leave Austin to cry.

One day long ago we painted daisies in the fields.
The last time I saw you was at your funeral.

Chorus:
The moon lit up the sky to say goodbye.
The stars laid out the map to find you.

You shocked the hell out of me.
I thought I was seeing Cherokees in the breeze.

Can you follow me all the way to California?
I'll be sitting on a hill by the blue sea.

"event","This is one of the first songs I wrote.  It was inspired by childhood events and people.  Pine Tree, Arkansas is where I spent most of my time growing up until I was 15.  It's about dealing with sexual issues in a repressed community, a notable best friend I called one night because my father was being an ass and a notable friend who dealt me my first blow of heartache associated with death.

Going down to see the Old man with the cigar.
He chews and chews while Myrtle sings the blues
down at Eliss' Grocery.

In the toolshed with nails and pails
I blew the blues ringing in my head.
All the while counting on you
to give me the strength to make it out of here.

This is my final plea, Pine Tree (Waving Home).

I called you late one night
to be consoled.
How could this be? 
You said, I don't understand.

Her picture was on the grave
by the highway.
Your light was so enormous.
Can't you see the sadness in me?
Trying to find someone like me?
 
This is my final plea, Pine Tree (Waving Home)."

"event","I'm so lazy to post in two diaries. But I do it.&nbsp;Hoi.

I have seen 5 episodes of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. It's cool. I want more and more. I downloaded&nbsp;ost, op and ed singles yeasterday. Sugoi. I'm so happy. I have 4 e[isodes more (6-9).. but 10-12 are not funsabbed. It's rather sad.. I know this anime about serious and sad things (can I say like that :P) but It;s easy and funny to watch. And I like links to other anime and things. It's cool, great, genious. I love it.

Also I have read two volumes of Angelic Layer. Omoshiroi. I like CLAMP. I'm not thier big fan. But I like their works..

I am going to sleep. It's usefull. I think."

"event","I don't want to study. Heh.. But I must do it XD But.. no matter..

I came home today earlier than usual. But.. I'm a little bit angry. About cars and boys of our group.. Egoists.. Demo now I feel myself much better.

Oh. I visited my friend today. Because she knew a friend of mine in the childhood. Kawaii.. It was hard to me to recognise.. But I did it. Unfortunelly I have no camera with me. Demo I like to see it. ^_^

I am going watching of Claymore. I like it. I don't know why but it attracts me. I remember some series I did not watch to the end. Bokura ga Ita (it was so sweeeeet.. Beeeee), Eureka 7 (I have some deals and after them I just forgot about this anime) and Tenjou Tenge (the same reason). So I decide finish it. After Claymore and DeliGaku. Maybe.

And the good news. I begin drawing in AutoCad. I'm so lazy. Like Konata. But I don't play.. so I don't know like whom..

My English...lalala.

And I want Aiba Hiroki calendar. T_T I want it. I want someone to skan it.."

"event","<p>Heh. One more day. I should clean up our flat. But I'm so lazy.. Honto..<br />Yesterday I one more time looked at the picture of Aiba's calendar. I wanted it!! But it's too expensive (for me) and I have no friends in Japan. I want someone to skan it. And maybe then I'll print it. Eh.. But he is so cute.. &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />I should do my term papers. But.. It's terrible that I'm so lazy. But It's typical for the students, ne? I'll do it.<br />Do your best, do your best *humming*<br /><br />Oh yeah. Yesterday I watched Switch until the end. It's great, i think. But.. My Japanese&nbsp;is much worth&nbsp;than my English. I don't understand practicular anything. Of course, I know the stiry at whole. But.. It's not enough &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />Ok. I'll go cleaning up. Gambatte.</p>"

I am missing about my phone-chan. Nya..<br />I really falled in love with AAA. They are great sometimes. So I decided to download their clips. But it is very hard.&nbsp; -___- 2 Gb.. But I'll do my best.. He-hee..<br /><br />Has Hiro-chan a girlfriend? I don't know. I want to say ""I hope he has not"". But.. It's not my deal.. I know it..<br /><br />Ok. That's over for today.. </p>"

"event","Eto.. I watched 22 episod of Lucky Star. It was funny as well. But it was rather sad when they talk about Kanata (Konata's mother). Her father is sure mad. You Know..

Abour my lessons. There were 2 of them. We hoped our teacher don't come, but he appeared. Boring..

And one more thing.. It was a chance today. I know it. But I don't know what to do. I don't know about what I can talk to him. And he is so cool and unbelievable. Sugoi.&nbsp;Actually, it is very hard to become a friend with somebody. I know we studied together 3 years. But I can't have free talk with more than half of our group. (I know my English is terrible) So I can't just go to him and to talk. I haven't no themes to talk. It's so awful. I know I'm stupid. Chances pass over me. Baka..

Because of Hiro-chan birthday I have a great mood today. It's cool.&nbsp;Actuualy I feeled so lonely at Saturday evening. I know it's not true. But.. Sometimes it seems that I am not very popular. -_- I means I have not&nbsp;many friends. And now I have no close friend. It's hard sometimes.

And you know? It's fun and easy to write about this things on English. I can't to write it in my diary on Russia. I don't know why.. XD Sometimes I am mad about this things. Oh I don't know how to say it.. Mata ashita. I hope"

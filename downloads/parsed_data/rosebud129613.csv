"event","ok so last night i was a little vicious and maybe a tad upset.  i apologize to everyone i might have scared at all with that rant.  

things are mostly better now, i recovered and hung out at White House last night and chilled with everyone (him included) and i slowly felt better.  there are still issues but on the whole, i don't want to take an ax or anything to a certain person's head anymore.  or whatever i was planning to do last night.

i dunno, i'm a little bummed/blehh right now.  but compared to last night, its a serious improvement.
and thank you Jess for your comment, it was highly appreciated <33"

"event","i think i just spent 3 days in heaven.  in other words, i went to newburgh for the weekend.

I got there around 6:45 on Friday night and i looked really cute :) and just seeing him open the door for me put the absolute biggest smile on my face.  we tried to go to a party in walkill but we got a little lost and then our only idea was to go down this really long gravelly road in the middle of a forest in the middle of nowhere and Matt didn't want to take his car down there so we just went back to the room instead.  I passed out at like 10:30 and I got to sleep next to my baby.  he's so freaking comfortable.

Saturday morning i was wide awake at 7:15am and i woke him up then too :p.  After we laid around all morning we headed to PA (Lords Valley) to have lunch with his parents and then the 4 of us went to Scranton.  His dad shopped while Matt, his mom and I went to see HP5.  I loved it, but no gushing here.  Everyone's got their own opinion about it, although when Fred and George escaped from Hogwarts def. has to be my favorite scene.  And Umbridge was played perfectly.  The end.

Aaanyways, we met Ritchie and his brother in Middletown on the way back from Scranton and the 4 of us carpooled to Poughkeepsie Sat. night for the Symphony X concert, which was the original reason I went to Newburgh for the weekend.  I was a little sick (I think i drank a little too much too fast lol) so I sat down the entire time.  But they played Paradise Lost, which is all I care about.  I was so thrilled they did that, I jumped up and ran to Matt and we just grinned like idiots the entire song.  That was the song that first introduced me to them, and it was amazing.  I have Matt to thank for that.  Tickets at the Chance are only $20 too, so it was quite affordable.  By the time we got back to Newburgh, I was totally passing out and Matt and I passed on the diner trip so we could go to sleep.  I was out like a light, curled up in my baby's sheets.  Apparently I looked ""cute"" lol.  

Sunday was the day I was supposed to leave.  I slept till 9 or 10 but then laid around for awhile again because we lay around and snuggle and cuddle alot and we have alot of fun doing it.  we ended up going to middletown to chill for about 3 hours (we had to leave at 5ish so I could get home around when my parents were expecting me) but Matt and i both didnt want to go so i called my mom and told her i was staying one more night because it was flooding and thunderstorming horribly and i didnt want to drive in that or in the dark.  complete excuses, but she knew i just wanted to stay and it was cool.  we ended up leaving m-city after 9.  we had a sick game of Kings going on and Wii bowling (i learned how to play and got 2 strikes in a row) and i was def. drunk by 2:30 in the afternoon lol.  Not too bad, but drunk and having a great time.  I spoke up a bunch too, I wasn't as quiet either.  I was really happy with myself.  :)  we ended up crashing around 11 last night and it was the best night of sleep.  i was just happily in his arms in my spot just like i slept all this past semester and i slept so good.  we both did actually, we're just so used to sleeping together that it's wonderful when we can again.  

this morning matt called out of work to spend some more time with me (:DDD) i stalled and didn't leave till a little after 1pm.  i walked around campus, nosed around some of the construction, visited Registrar and Res Life to take care of some stuff and spent lots more cuddly time with Matt.  and i only cried a little bit when i left this time, it was an improvement.

this weekend i extremeily happily gorged myself on quiznos and subway (my 2 new favs), mint chocolate sandwich ice cream, and malibu and more malibu.  i love him and he loves me and snuggling with him is the sweetest thing i can think of.  i saw a bunch of his friends who i havent seen in awhile, i got to chill with his parents who are also great...and he's coming to visit in a few weeks.

i dont care that i have 5 days straight of work ahead of me or that I'm home under the wing of parents again or anything.  i am in love and theres nothing you can do to change that feeling.

The End <3."

maybe i need school.  maybe i just need to see the person who i miss the absolute most and who i love more than anything.  maybe i need to feel less controlled.  maybe i need to end this raging battle inside my head for the willpower to act like a 20 year old.  maybe i can find a way to start liking church again, or at least make it bearable.  maybe i need to find a way to make people see that im really not a bad person, because it really hurts that they think that.. maybe i need my friendships to settle down and just be normal again.  or maybe i need to accept that i have to let go of some of them.  maybe i need my heart to get over itself.  or maybe i need it to keep loving him so much.  maybe i just need all of this. and then some.

well you know what, thats fine.  go ahead and deal with your own shit.  you don't want to be as tight anymore, and things won't be the same, well thats cool.  you're on your fucking own then.  

granted, i made mistakes.  i still make mistakes.  i'm only human people.  its part of life.  but realize that i can bitch you out and make you feel fucking horrible for what you did to me, as bad as you're making me feel right now.  but im above that, im a better person than that.  you made your own fucking mistakes too, and im not bringing them up and throwing a shitfit at you, cuz i certainly would be justified if i did.

and then i sped home and got to work 2 mins. early and made $5.  my one table, and i spilled salad dressing all down the front of me.  i need like 3 showers to get this all off of me.  yay for training.



....   i hate crying.  like, everything's so good right now but in my head, somethings just..not.  its like i have this underlying ..thing.. that wont go away and constantly tries to spoil everything that makes me happy.  how can one negative thing counteract so much positive?  if you look at my life and everything i have going for me, i should be the happiest person in the world.  but then if you scroll down through my lj entries semi-recently, i seem to be so unhappy because thats where whatevers bothering me decides to come out.  no one else can tell, if its really important, im unfortunately usually too good for people to tell what im thinking or if its really bothering me.  not even the people closest to me.  for real, im a mess.

im sorry if these entries have worried anyone or anything, but i still havent found my journal, so this is my place to really let off all the unhappiness inside.  i dont have anywhere else to let loose, and i dont know who i'd tell or what i'd tell, since no one takes me seriously."

2 days till new york, if my new job doesnt put me to work that night.  theres going to be ice cream and a boat involved, and i'll be seeing brianna, matt and sean.  it should be fun.

i need to keep unpacking and sorting; yesterdays trip to walmart helped alot.  and then i start my job tonight, i'll be server training at Captains.

But whether things are a little shaky or tense for a few days still or we go right back to talking the way we used to, june 2nd is going to come home and i'm giving him the biggest 'i missed you' hug ever and we'll have the whooole day to spend together.  in spite of everything, i'm really happy and excited.  i miss him.

in other news, i unblocked kerry tonight and have been talking to him for a little bit.  we shall see if i begin to feel smothered and will have to reblock him again, or if maybe he's gotten the hint this time and we can talk online like normal people and be friendly.

i gave up on the metro because i called once and stopped in twice and howard himself ssid that i would be getting a phone call last night with my schedule, etc.  and oh look, i didn't.  no response again.  so i went job hunting today.  got some positive response from sassafras (they wanted to start me as a busser two nights a week), then some more good response from the plaza diner (although they never officially told me that they were hiring, although they took my info, and i'd see wayy too many people i know there).  finally, i was nearing the end of my search and went into captain's, and they hired me on the spot and were the only people to actually come out and say that they had spots open for new hirees.  

i went to virtus tonight (the child sexual abuse class) for four hours, slept, spaced and the plaza called me in the middle of it to want me to come in for an interview the next few days.  i was like ummm, i dont know what to do.  im gonna make sure captain's calls me like they said they would to set up my training, so i can get thaat off the ground next week after my treatments end.  

tomorrow i'm calling mrs. hope to finalize some tutoring, cleaning my room, hopefully finishing unpacking my college stuff, and getting my first shot.  im working at the carnival at night, and then me and Em are going on Wed. night.  If anyone wants to come along, let me know.

PS.  Anyone from Shelton, if you have bags of cans to be returned to the grocery store, is it possible I could have them?  i'm raising $ for my swim team, and im trying to collect as many cans/plastics/glass as possible.  if you let me know, i can come pick them up.  thank you :)"

i have news about my summer and the one person i really wanted to tell wasn't in the mood to listen to me.  so i'll put it down here i guess.  


my parents went away sunday through today and it was sweet, first or second time they've left me and laura home alone.  we were saints, because they're going away again in june and thats when shit's gonna go down ;).  i did 3 loads of laundry (mostly mine, since i survived doing no laundry from easter till the end of school.  and i still had clean clothes when i came home haha), dishes, cooked, drove my sister around, did taxes, worked on unpacking my stuff, and ran all my errands yesterday.  i went to long hill to ask about working at summer school and the chair of it told me they were pretty full up so far but she took my transcript and my resume and said she'd call me if anything ended up being available.  since i'm not a certified teacher, i wouldn't be able to actually teach but i could tutor and be an aide, which is good enough for me if they call me.  it gets my foot in the door.  then i got lost and finally found the board of ed. and put in my request for subbing in the Shelton school system, god help me lol.  apparently the waiver (since again, im not certified) and the whole process takes about 3-4 weeks, which is just about when public school gets out for the summer, but oh well.  i might get a day or two in, and then it's just a matter of reapplying for next year.  i have to get fingerprinted and a background check, uh ohh :)  lastly, i went to the metro and saw howard who was like, so are you back for the summer now?  can we put you on the schedule?  fucking sweeet.  the manager was supposed to call me last night for availability and all that, but he never did, so im giving him till tomorrow or thursday and then calling him.  i need to get this job going, i don't want to be in debt all summer.  im hoping i'll only need a month to pay this off.  but it was really good news and i wanted to share it.  yesterday was really productive and turned out well.

last night was minigolf with bri and brandon, who i caught up with.  i distanced myself from them alot since thanksgiving or so, but i needed that space to get over all the bullshit from last summer.  it's so sad i needed so much time away from people who i was tightest with.  we were best friends and now i have no best friend and i did that to myself.  but yeahh..they invited me to a party at a friend of Francis's, but Heroes was on and that came first :p.  honestly, i have all summer to go out and party.  it was a monday in may for god sakes that they decided to get twisted.  but heroes was real bad ass and made up for not going out.  the ending gave me chills, i have no patience waiting for next weeks finale.  

and then my night went downhill cuz i got into what i think was one of the stupidest fights online i've ever been in.  i was really hurt that someone who says he cares about me couldn't take a few minutes out to listen to my day when i was really happy cuz we had talked on the phone the night before and he couldn't do it every night.  i was just like, are you kidding.  im not asking for hours of your life every night, just 5 fucking minutes, and only if i have a story or something i want to say.  the whole thing really really upset me.  

i feel like i give too much and just let people take and take and take from me.  I trust too easily and I can't help giving people second chances whether they deserve it or not. all I want is to be loved and cared about.  <b>i want people to give a shit about me.</b>  yeah my family does, but they're supposed to.  what about everyone else?  my friends?

i really hope this is my period talking, because if it isn't, my life is a pretty fucking sad reality.


well this got a smidge negative, but i haven't found my journal in everything i've unpacked from school yet, so this'll have to do."

i'm about to leave college for 3 months and i am miserable beyond belief.  i feel like shit and i don't know if its because i am in denial or if i'm confused.  tomorrow's going to be such an emotional day because my roomie is leaving and it will be the last time i get to see someone for three months who means so much to me.  i'm surrounded here by half packed boxes and my stuff all around me and wishing i could be a hero tomorrow and be able to freeze time.  anytime before 5:00pm.  i feel bad because i am going to get home and i'll make my family feel bad.  they'll think i don't want to be home, and i love seeing them.  i know laura has been counting down the hours until i get home, my mom is cooking dinner especially for me tomorrow night and waiting for me.  they're soo excited, and it makes me feel even worse.  but its who i won't be seeing that is making me so sad.

yeah, i have a busy summer lined up.  i'm taking an intro spanish class at Sacred Heart, i'll be waitressing at the metro, i'll be babysitting, tutoring and subbing.  i'll turn 20, i'll be running VBS.  i'll be going on vacation with my family, hopefully back to Ocean City.  I'll be swimming and going to the gym almost every day, I'm getting my lifeguard certification.  I'll be working on my unit plan for one of my classes next fall.  Hopefully I'll be visiting my mcnasty and stephy in LI for a weekend, and who knows about my friends at home, if there are any left.  I'm going to be so busy, but right now, none of that matters.  i just can't seem to appreciate it, even though i know i should.

"event","I just registered for my classes for next semester...5 days early.  The Dean said if I had any issues with anything, to use his name in Registrar and go talk to them.  So basically my issue was that if I waited until when I was supposed to register (next Tues. afternoon), I would've been closed out of basically everything I needed and since I'm already a little bit behind, I wouldn't have graduated on time.  So now voila!  5 beautiful classes and a most wonderful schedule as follows:

MWF:

8:45-10  Calc. II
10:10-11:05 Methods of Teaching
>break for mass and lunch<
12:20-1:15 Foundations of Literacy
>nice long break...dinner at 4:30<
5:15-6:40 Psych of Exceptional Learner (only MW)
>swim practice from 7-9<

TH:

11:10-12:35 Math for Elementary Schoolteachers II

And that, my friends, is my ONLY class on Tues/Thurs.  I mean, I'll have choir in the late afternoons right before swimming, but that isn't an official class.  And I get to sleep until 10:30 on those days if I want to.  Life is glorious.

The plan...
*Hw
*Soccer at 3 lol
*Choir 3:45-4:45
*Dinner
*@ Kaplan for 5:30
*Girls Home Swim Meet @ 7:30 tonight!!

I'm actually gonna be at school overnight now, and leaving after Basics and CalcI tomorrow for the weekend/Monday afternoon.  And class was good today, I missed fieldwork, I rocked my Logic tests and I got to hang out with Matt for a bit.  :D  My boy is <u>wonderful</u>.  Seeing him alone just made my day.

So I need to get my ass out of bed earlier than I'd like to tomorrow morning after a busy night tonight of dancing and swim until I can't move.  Or something along those lines.  And then on top of everything else, my phone, which was half charged this morning, only has one small bar of battery left after I get out of practice today.

"event","So it's Amber's birthday today and I blew up balloons at Amy's last night and had to wait until she fell asleep so I could bring them back.  I feel deathly sick right now (thanks you Matt most likely) and I went to bed at 2:30am, which was quite dumb.  On the flip side, my boyfriend makes me soo happy and I would love to beat him tomorrow night in Mount Olympics, since I just got called and asked if I can swim for the sophomores.  :D  And then our Invitational on Sunday too (I'm swimming 50breast and 50free).  And Bonfire was the shit and this week is looking pretty hot.  And I went country line dancing with Amy and Amber last weekend, and we're going again this Friday night.  And I got Matt to agree to come so it's going to be a really great night.  Mental note:  find something reallyyy cute to wear.

But of course, I need to go pretend that I know calculus and eat food at the same time.  And maybe squeeze a nap in somewhere.  Oh, that would be glorious."

Not to mention the charley horse I got in my leg last night that wouldn't even let me finish practice.  Bah humbug.  

But then a certain someone bought me dinner after practice :) and I went scrapbooking for 4 hours because I didn't feel like doing hw.  But today was simply wonderful.  I worked with Coach one-on-one and went through a lot of what they're gonna do at practice tonight and I did it all really really good.  And I don't even feel ridiculously tired, just worked out.  So now is dinner, hw, laundry and calc time.  And then practice #2 of the day from 5:30-7.  Coach is letting me out early because it'll be my second of the day and I have to get home tonight.  Which means I get to see my family and Midknight and Joe tonight.

So I've been a lazy bum as far as updating this this summer.  Basically, I've had hree jobs to keep me busy:  babysitting, tutoring and waitressing at Vincent's Restaurant right across from St. Lawrence.  I have rediscovered I like clubs and my last time to go is sadly, this Thurs.  Although possibly Friday night as well after I get out of work and Emily's party people become tired.  What else...this summer I have liked a 16-yeear-old and a 27-year-old, which means there's something quite wrong with me.  I have learned why you don't date a co-worker.  I have had hand surgery, a physical, my first ob-gyn exam (-not- a fun time), bloodwork done in the last few weeks and now there is a good chance I'll have to have surgery again, this time on my neck to remove my thyroid gland, which scares the living shit out of me.  Not just this time because there's going to be needles in me, but I'll be put to sleep completely and I'll have to stay overnight in Yale, which freaks me out, and some doctor's gonna be cutting open my neck.  And for you science nerds out there, I have just learned exactly what my thyroid gland does.  Apparently it's important enough that after this surgery, I have to take pills for the rest of my life.  Every day.  Which I don't like either because I'm only 19 and not some old lady.  But if I have this surgery, most likely will be soon, there is an extremely good chance that I won't be an Orientation leader this year and/or not start school on time with everyone else, which really upsets me.  As much as I love being home, I have also been looking forward to this for foreverrrrr.  It's just really frustrating.

What else in this jumbled mess of my summer...I finally got my own car which is beautiful, and has already been to Newport, RI and made countless trips to New/East Haven.  I went to LI to visit Matt Fres, who I absolutely love, for the weekend and LI is absolutely gorgeous.  I went to a Jack's Mannaquin/O.A.R. concert last night with Laura, Kaitlin and Megan, which was fun, except for the fact that I don't know alot of their music, so the songs I finally did know came on between 10:30-11, when the show ended.  I basically had to wait 3 hours for something I knew.  Good show, but I was quite tired after awhile.  Oh yes, and speaking of LI, I've gotten sooo much closer to Steph, which I didn't think was possible after rooming with her for a year and then finding out she's not coming back to MSMC, which I hatehatehate but there's nothing I can do about it.  You are like my loverr for life and some little silly thing like school academics making you leave isn't gonna change that.  Keep your head up and don't forget about me in LI.  

Enough rambling...must get ready.  Today includes Kohls, the dentist, mall for some school shopping, in that order, and then bball at the gym with Will and mass at 7 tonight, not sure which order that will be in.  And then 6Flags tomorrow with the kids I would die without!  Love BriLauraJoeBrandon!!  ok i'm done..."

I was really excited to come home last Thursday to see everyone and just get away because school was kicking my ass, but now I have to face that I have over three months of nothing ahead of me.  

In my immediate future I have a mall trip with Laura and Bri planned for Thursday, Bri's bday on Friday (either movies to see the DaVinci Code...so excited!!  or clubbing that night) and then Saturday is Bill's graduation.  I actually have a ticket to go; it's just a matter of transportation, since apparently my parents need the car because they want to go away for the weekend.  It has a good chance of happening though, so that makes me happy.  My surgery is one week from today, but we won't talk about that and its unspeakableness.  Other than that, Bill's coming to CT in the next few weeks, a bday getogether with my friends from school is in the works for midJune and I might be going to Sacred Heart to take a summer class starting early June, since I won't be able to do much else one-handed.  High school/College graduations are coming up (yayy for all seniors I know) and that's about it.  It's just frustrating though because if it wasn't for my hand, I'd be happily working at least 2 jobs this summer.  But now I'm just reduced to babysitting.

"event","Well, I must say the semester of suicide totally lived up to its name.  My classes are soo much harder and I've gotten a ton more hw, so that's how I spend my life now.  I swear, I've hung out with friends like twice since I've gotten back.  Last weekend I went on the SEARCH 06 retreat with Amber and we had a blast.  Ghetto Sammy in particular made my Saturday.  The flipping coolest part is that it was almost exactly like Emmaus, with kara and Agape and talks and everything.  I almost died of happiness, although it was more about finding yourself and knowing yourself instead of being completely religious.  So I hope when I'm a leader next year we can change it up a bit.  But Fab 5ive forever!  :)

Let's see...what else...oh on my way to the retreat, we stopped at the Riverside Deli right by school and I applied so they're calling me this week.  My mom's bday was Sunday so after I got back from the retreat my parents and sister came up so I was happy.  I'll see my parents in two weeks again for Parents Weekend- yayy.  We have a crazy rehearsal schedule the next 10 days or so until our show on Friday Feb. 10, and I have to get my RA application done- yes I'm applying to be an RA- how cool!!  Like I need something else to keep me busy...lol I got Amber involved with the Clarion so now she and I are officially in charge of photography for the paper or something so it's funny.  Choir's picking up after a really bad first day and I've been asked to be a part of the Campus Ministry Student Advisory Board, which is really cool.  We get to pick the next grad assistant to be in charge of Campus Ministry, since Frankie leaves at the end of this semester.  So far I'm the only one asked and most likely will be the only freshman asked.  So I was really excited.  

Tonight I have rehearsal, tomorrow I'm drinking/doing karaoke with Bill, which is going to be quite amusing and then Fri. night Brianna Kane and I are doing the movie/chinese/drinking thing again, so as of Saturday morning I shall be quite sick.  I can't wait...lol Oh and rehearsal Fri. night too and most likely Sat. sometime.  I just want to make it to the weekend because I have so much to catch up on and I need the time to get on top of everything, since I lost last weekend to the retreat.  

So overall things are really good here, I'm happy because Amber and I are getting really tight, and I miss the fantastic 4 from home.  I was on the phone with Bri for an hour last night and it made my night.  I also got to talk to Joe for the first time since I came back and I miss him more than ever too.

Time to go clean/do the hw thing, before dinner and rehearsal.  I really do need to relax..."

The only thing missing was the whipped cream.  Shame I only remembered it after she left and I almost died coming home because it was hailing/sleeting/windy like craazy.

So the semester of suicide is rapidly approaching...the 22nd is coming waay too fast all of a sudden.  But good news- Wes is coming to CT on Monday to visit friends so I'm determined to get to see him because actually seeing one of my MSMC friends while on break would be like the most amazing thing!  

Yes so today I cleaned my room and vacuumed and did laundry and got up a little bit before 1.  Bri came over and we had adventures described above which were quite entertaining and I am the champion at Wheel of Fortune and Who Wants to Be a Millionare? and now I'm home again.  Tomorrow is mass at 9 of course, since I haven't been to a SJ mass in foreverrr and then at night Bri, Joe and Brandon are coming over for me, and Dani M and Megan for Laura and we are having a crazy sleepover ( minus boys) but possibly making more cupcakes and we're renting the newest American Pie and having some soda pong rematches and there's always CatchPhrase if we're desperate and I can't waitt because I'm going to be in one flipping crazy house tomorrow night.  Bri and I are gonna play around in makeup and dress up in random clothes and take pictures.

Rest of the week plans as follows:

Monday
//hang with Wes
//Bri sleepover
//UConn game at night with my dad and uncle

Tuesday/Thursday
//tutoring

Some random time
//hang out with Emilyyy
//get my hair cut/styled? with Bri
//catch up with Spicer and Kel (separately most likely)

and of course I have most of next weekend for the Fantastic 4 to be fantastic one more time. lol  I love them so much.  I hate it when things are awkward.

Running around in the snow with no clothes on, soda pong and my awesome present from Spicer so we all blew our ears out for the first half hour of the New Year.  Minus about a half hour of a doze, I finally fell asleep at 7:15ish this morning and woke up around 10.  But we all crashed in my den so it was very uncomfortable and that 3 hours was really jumbled.  We all went to 11:30 mass at St. Lawrence and I crawled into bed when I got home at 1:30 and passed out till 6:30.  And I accidentally broke my camera.  But Laura's still worked, so I'm dying to get the pictures onto my computer.  The boxer modelings were especially priceless by Joe and Brandon.  But I'm paying for it now...

It's being home and decorating and listening to Star99 for all those weeks and all the Christmas music that gets me excited.  But this year I couldn't really care less.

So I talked to my mom last night and apparently she's already lined me up to deliver Dunkin Donuts to her class tomorrow morning at like 9:30.  Just a tad early, don't you think?  Although on the flip side she got me a major tutoring job as soon as I get home for the winter break.  I'll happily take $25 an hour, especially with Christmas coming up and a smashed car bumper to still pay for.  I almost choked when she asked me if $25 was ok.  (I get $10 here, if I'm lucky.)

So tonight:  I'm leaving with Eric around 7-7:30 so I'm hoping to be home by 9.  Then time with my mommy because I miss her, and of course the rest of the family and then Bri's heading straight over after work.  Of course.  I can't wait to see her, and that's the biggest understatement of all.  I think once my mom goes to bed Bri and I are heading out of course.  =)  Ruby's to see my old manager and then Wendys because I miss their drivethru like you have no idea.  Tomorrow I'll be at St. Joe's with my mom and her class for awhile, I'm going to the pep rally, chauffeuring duty after SHS gets out and then out to lunch with Deb at 2.  Thanksgiving is Thursday at my grandparents, the football game and of course, mass at 7AM.  And then I think I'm headed to RI on Friday for my dad's side Thanksgiving, and I have to fit in a sleepover (otherwise the secret lovers would cry) and of course seeing Joe and Brandon and Kel and all of everyone.  And *Emmaus stuff* and I wanna hit up the meeting if I can Sunday and I'm not coming back to school until the crew has had a movie marathon and we've seen HP4 and Rent, since I'm absolutely dying to go see them.

That's up from five classes this semester, which were a joke.  Here we go:

Child Psychology- MWF 9:05-10
Honors Forms of Literature- MWF 10:10-11:05
Intro to New Testament- MWF 1:25-2:20
MST II- TH 8:25-10:25
Intro to Basketball- T 11:10-12:10
US History, 1865 to Present- TH 2:20-3:45
Orientation to Teaching- W 4-6
Voice Workshop- TH 3:50-5:50

**My eighth class isn't for credit, but it still counts as four hours of my week gone.  But it's music and there's no way I'd miss it.

::dies::  Now that I've finally gotten to register for this semester, I've sadly come to the conclusion that I'll be taking two classes at home next summer (some history class and then a language...spanish?  french?  italian?  german?) and then add my job.  Erin will have no life next summer either.  I can't wait.

And I get to come home Tuesday night after choir's over, but I'm not dying to come home like the rest of the world.  For some reason, I'm fine where I am.  Yeah, I miss Bri and Joe and the rest of everyone and my family alot, but I like college.  Scratch that, I love college.  I have no reason for wanting to leave.  And I've been here for six weeks.  I'm so busy- now that I'm moving up on the Clarion staff and drama and frisbee and Campus Ministry.  I've signed myself up for our annual retreat- SEARCH '06, the weekend after we come back from winter break.  The editors of our paper are putting my email down as part of the Clarion email so whenever they get email, I'll start getting it too.  I can start doing some editing and they're most likely getting me a key for our office.  It's amazing.  This weekend I'm actually getting PAID to go sing at mass a few towns over for Christ the King.  How flipping cool is that...they actually needed sopranos.  Later on Sunday I'm going to visit a nursing home for a HarvestFest since I miss volunteering like crazy and then I'm getting trained as an altar server at mass that night here.  Tomorrow there's a karaoke/recording session up at the boys' dorm so my roommates and I are going to head over there.  The first weekend of December goes:  Friday night- our formal (!!!).  I'm wearing my senior swirl dress with the same shoes and straightening my hair, since that's my new latest kick.  I've finally learned how to use a straightener, thanks to Laura leaving her straightener here after Sibs Weekend.  That night's going to be amazing- it's dinner too, so I got invited to the table with Eric and Jimbo and Kevin and all us campus ministry kids that I love to death.  I absolutely heart my friends.  That Saturday is our dress rehearsal up at the Motherhouse and then Sunday is Vespers, our hugely popular Christmas service.  I'm auditioning later for solos for it (!!! ack!) and my parents! are coming up for it!!!  They're staying over that night too, so that is just completely amazing.  And then on top of that I only have ONE FINAL.  

Now do you understand why I don't want to leave?  lol I think I'm looking forward most to the ride home, for -obvious- transportation reasons.  =)  Eric's bringing me to Danbury since he lives in New Milford, and then my dad and possibly Bri and Joe are meeting me there.  So for now I forget about my impending death next semester and just happily live for now."

But man, to sleep ten hours anyways...I don't think I've ever slept this late before.  I think it's time to go make food and start hw. Dinner'll be around 5 and then party tonight?

"event","Getting my ass kicked in bball by some really hot older guys is a beautiful thing, especially when it has a possibility of leading to some chill time with them laterr  XD

Time to go jump in the shower so I don't embarrass myself, then movies with Brianna at 10:15.  Has anyone seen Just Like Heaven- its supposed to be good hopefully...then either to Danny's (hot older guy lol) or back to my dorm to chill for awhile cuz I haven't seen that girl in like forever!  Man, I love weekends...

I actually was productive today.  I got up at 11, finished my part of the MST presentation and then put it together with my girls at the library around 1.  When I got back from lunch, I spent the afternoon cleaning MAJORLY:  our bathroom, common room, my room- you name it, I scrubbed/dusted/vacuumed it.  I was crazy and insane and I never want to do it again.  That's when I decided to go ball for awhile, cuz it doesn't make sense to shower and then play.  And now I can't move because I haven't exercised like that in years and every single muscle that I know of and some that I don't hurt like hell.  Ahh, the joys of basketball.

Later dudes!"

"event","So college is like wicked cool.  My own computer, freedom, later curfew (I've already tried out the 3AM curfew on Sat. nights heehee) and the food is edible.  I've already seen Brianna Kane and JoeLo <3 once each- friends from CAM and Chris Guarino (also from CAM).  Chris and I hung out Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  He's making dinner for me and my suitemate tonight although I don't know if Chantelle can come.  And I know we're doing something Saturday morning/afternoon too.  I love this kid- he and I have gotten so close while I've been here, and I've only been here like 5 days.  The campus is gorgeous, my roomies are great and one's a huge partier.  We've got so much alcohol in our room, its crazy.  =)

I've already joined campus ministry- I'm singing at mass on Sunday.  I'll also get to lector and be an altar server in the future.  I joined the school paper, Habitat for Humanity and the Drama Club.  I discovered that my Voice Workshop class is actually the MSMC Choir and I had to audition yesterday (my first day) to even stay in the class.  I MADE ITTTTTTTTTTTTT, which excited the hell out of me.  I'm still smiling so much randomly, its amazing.  A ton of people were telling me when I left that I had a really good voice too, so I'm beyond psyched for that class.  It's going to be amazing, although on a funny note we're singing the Hallelujah Chorus for our big service, the Christmas Vespers in December.  (hahahahahaha Kerrry...I swear that song will haunt me forever.)  lol  So I've accidentally added school choir to my list of activities- oops!  My MST class is full of too much science and I've already had 2 labs due.  It's killing me, especially after not having had science last year.  Honors english is ok so far, but looking like a lot of work.  The one sucky thing is being required to go on all these extra field trips.  The one that I know of so far is a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the City.  I hate museums and I hate art so I'm thrilled for that trip.  Not.  Logic seems decent for 9:30 in the morning.  The instructor is cool.  I'll survive.  And the College Experience teacher seems kinda boring.  Making friends is ridiculous around here, I swear.  Everyone's perfectly friendly but they've all got their own friends and don't need another one apparently.  It's getting really frustrating.  

Best news:  Bri and Joe are coming up this weekend!!!  And possibly my sister too.  Sooooooooo excited.  I miss them all so much, especially my sister.  It's insane how close we've gotten.  She actually called me on her own yesterday right when she got out of school to let me know how her first day was.  It was so sweet. 

And something of amusement:  I imed JoeJack (CAM buddy) today cuz I haven't talked to him in awhile and I missed him.  What a crazy convo that followed...

"event","I <i>hate</i> running out of time to see people.  This has been an amazing summer but it seems today is my day to catch up with people who I haven't seen much of or at all.  I'm going down later to say goodbye to the Merolas (Matt's grandparents) because his grandma has been like a second grandma to me and I love her to death.  I'm gonna miss her soo much.  I might run into Matt while I'm there, who mentioned something about going to Marist today, but maybe not.  Tonight Spicer and I are going out to dinner/movies and catch up on our lives and I think my sister is coming with us.  Tonight is Kerry Calandra's mini-party so I can say goodbye to her as well...ack I'm going to miss her so much.  NO ONE is as blond or beautiful as her, although I might have found someone who loves Wicked as much as she and I do.  That's still our musical forever though.  <3

Bri's sleeping over tonight, which starts the emotional goodbye.  That is going to be the hardest thing of all.  We've been tearing up about it since Emmaus at the end of April but we just haven't thought about it much so we've been ok.  Now its here and I dunno...I'm stocking up on tissues and I think she's bringing some sparkling cider.  She's going to be here all day tomorrow.  I know she and I are doing our scrapbook pg. for Fr. Nick then and bringing it to Jamie's and then tomorrow night Joe, Lauren and Kelly are coming over to say goodbye.  That's what I'm really not looking forward to.  As much as I have to say goodbye, I hate them and I'm not looking forward to it.  Ugh...damn college.  Joe and Bri are already plotting to come see me around Labor Day weekend.  I soo hope they can- I'm already getting excited for it.  :)  And then Friday morning arrives and I L.E.A.V.E.  

Biggest plus about going to college:  getting to see JoeLo, Brianna and Chris much much more often.  I miss my CAM friends sooo much!!
Biggest neg about going to college:  leaving Laur.  I know, my sister right?  It's weird but all of a sudden I think it clicked in her mind about two days ago that I'm leaving so soon.  Now she's letting me borrow all her stuff (since most of mine is packed) and she's seriously confiding in me.  Monday night she actually fell asleep on me curled up like she actually loved me.  Adorable but strange.  Last night we almost went to see a movie until we discovered that Stratford has almost no movies starting around 8 because they're dumb.  So we went shopping instead.  Marshall's isn't as bad as I thought, I suppose.  I got some new shirts there and at PacSun yesterday so I'm pretty set for school.  And then Laura, who swore she knew where we were going, ended up getting us lost in Bpt.  We drove on E. Main for awhile, passed the DMV and ended up at the entrance to Route 8, by Exit 7.  Right by the Trumbull movies.  Thank God I learned how to get to that theater this summer or we still would have been in trouble.  It was an experience.  

Laura:  ""ERIN LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD.""  ::locks doors::  ""Can we bolt this car shut somehow?""  

And we weren't even in the ghetto.  haha I love my sister.  We've bonded so much the last few days, now I really don't want to leave her.  Amazing what impending separation does to people.  Off to find food and finish up things around here.  

**If I haven't gotten to hang out with you these last few weeks, whether we've tried and plans have fallen through or whatever the circumstance, I'm really sorry.  All of a sudden school just came out of nowhere and I realized there's more to get ready than just going to high school.  (lol duh)  So for all the times I ran out of time or we just couldn't coordinate, I'm sorry.  We'll definitely make plans when I come back."

Tonight I set Joe up with one of my friends from work and it sounds like they're hitting it off.  ::takes bow::  I've been working as much as I can, which isn't very much, thank you managers.  I closed last night and tonight and most likely tomorrow and I'm closing Monday night too.  I'm doing more college shopping at Kohl's tomorrow because sales are wonderful and then Caroline's grad/bday party after work, Sunday is church-Ctteens lunch-computer shopping-my last YG meeting-clubbing with the crew!!  and then either sleepover at my house or Joe's.  Monday or Tuesday is the sale at the mall since we have free giftcards to a few places and Wed. is my haircut.  I'm getting behind on my list of projects to do over the summer- I have 13 days left!  :)  And all of a sudden tons of people are like ""Well we won't see you soon so we have to hang out before you leave.""  Multiply that by about 10-15 people and I'm losing my mind.  If ever my life was a juggling act before, this would top them all.  Although thankfully I'm less tired now.  Last week I kept crashing around 11 and couldn't stay up for anything.  Now I'm back to my normal 12:30-2:30 middle of the night computer free for all.  Damn PMS.  Other random tidbits:  I really did get tan at Ocean City, my doctor thinks I'm some kind of nympho sex maniac, I almost got fired (really should have just left the other night), and my new purple hamper for college has springs and is bouncy.  Waay cool.  And JoeLo randomly called me last weekend to ""check up on me"" and I've only talked to him once since.  Complete enigma, that boy.  I've seen Joe five days in a row now, Bri four out of the five and the 3 of us have perfected the whole last minute, sudden random hanging-out around 10 till about 11:30 or so and then racing to get home and beat curfew.  I was fifteen minutes late twice this week and somehow got away with it.  When are my parents ever not up when I come in?  Amazingg.  Today Joe and I played this hysterical trick on Brandon when he was at work and we had to drop Bri off- we got a package of condoms for ""ultra pleasure"", the extra long ones and went to Brandon's line to pay for them.  The look on his face was absolutely <i>priceless</I>.  We actually had to tell him we didn't want them- I was like excuse me??  What do you think I'd actually be doing with these right now??  Man I love that kid.  I hope he gets ungrounded soon.  And my curfew seems to have decreased from 12 to 11:30 as this summer has gone on.  Wonder why.  Enough rambling for tonight- good night!"

"event","I would just like to point out right now that I am still awake right now, and with the exception of a half hour nap at 11:30 yesterday, I have been up since 8:00.  Which for Erin, is <u>quite</u> an accomplishment.  Think it's a new personal record.  I mean, prom night was later, but I was with people.  I normally can't make it this late by myself.  

Today was mass at 9- I was a lector- and then I headed home to get ready for the family July 4th party, which also was my family grad party, since my dad insisted on having a family one.  (I really didn't care either way.)  The pool was fun- ""omg my top!!""  haha and all the times we jumped on each other and carried each other out of the pool.  I ended up going to Matt's with Bri and Laura instead of the mall because I had no, or next to no gas.  I brought Bri home for 11, somehow managed to stretch a 12 curfew to 1 and hung around downstairs with Laur, Kerryboy and Beth. We played video games, Magic (me and Kerry) and then when I got back from Bri's they'd turned on HP II.  We watched most of that until it was time to go and now I'm here.  I talked to Kerry for awhile and then decided to update, for lack of better things to do right now besides eat chips (my new love).  This week's schedule includes work at 5 today?/tomorrow, a double on Tuesday, and work at 4 on Wed.  Thursday I'm gonna finally introduce Rob to Bri when I go get my tips because he's opening the bar.  Friday at some godawful time I'm seeing the Steubie kids off and then packing for Appalachia.  We leave on Saturday- only five days away!!!  I really have to dig out my room before I leave though- one of those really big cleaning digs though- and I'm taking a walk to SJS tomorrow I think.  Lotta stuff swirling around in my mind right now.  And the exercise is always nice.  And hopefully Jess and I'll get to hang out before Saturday, if she can spare from her busy schedule.  lol   Now that I'm significantly tired and this entry has been one nice long jumble, I'm ending it here.

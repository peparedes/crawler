"event","the hair party was yesterday- kind of fun? sam came i love sam. my hair is so short she only did five twists and everyone else had nine or ten. i had a veryyyyyyyyy nice time with the banister. i have cool pictures with me and gina on top of eachother while we're on top of the banister ;). Boob wars with the coaches o yea i came in second or third haha everyone thinks they have boobs but they dont. gina p and liz were practically having lesbian loving on the couch sexy kind of! 

we (sam and me) came home went to bed kind of early so i could wake up at 8ish. i couldnt wear makeup whats up with that? we got to the place and -no joke- we practiced for 2 and a half hours before we must have done the routine 40 times. almost fainted my arms and legs were shaking FUN times. we had to go in front of everyone in the beginning for a practice run. We s-u-c-k-e-d hard music didnt come on count was off stunts fell we didnt say the cheer. when we ran ((more like flew off the mat)) everyone was in tears. even me that hasnt happened for a while but it was so stressful. no one wanted to go on but i dried my tears and got everyone to say that we'd go out again. counvincing them wasnt easy. the sad part was i knew we were good. i wasnt about to let everything we worked for count for shit. so we practiced a for an hour. we ran onto the mat music came on good stunting good cheer good tumbling it was purrfect. we kicked our lady of perpetual help's ass! we ran off screaming and hugging. IT WAS THE BEST FEELING I HAD IN A LONGGG TIME! so happy then we took a break and it was awards time. dun Dun DUN! we got two trophies for the coaches favorite and over all goodness. fun time and then we were all happy again me sam and my sister went out to eat yea! would it kill my sister to say good job instead it was ""i thought one of the girls was going to fall but she didnt"" nice support here christina. 

well i gtg i want to nap and watch tv. ughh my parents want me to do accelerated AGAIN oh god please not that! anything but that...

"event","i havent updated in a while nothing too interesting has happened. I went bowling with sam deb kate and lauren on sunday. whoaa i had a baad time. the stupid guy yelled at us for having two people on the lane at one time asshole. lauren came over after that more fun than bowling we watched 10 things i hate about you<3. monday and tuesday were boring. wednesday oh wednesdays i had cheerleading of course and an interesting thing happened when i went online. jess jess jess wow who just tells people to go away without a reason?! well i guess jessica. o and deb told me in gym the only reason she was so unhappy was because she got into LUHI (lutheran hight school-a jew in lutheran high school riiiight). she wanted to take the test to get in and she wanted to go but shes going to wear a uniform-what a tragedy. i guess she'll miss her friends here funny i dont think she'd tell sal or teena, or jenna, or kelly or sam or anyone to go fuck off-thats interesting. see, this is what happens when you are there for someone for 4-5 years you get blown off i just dont understand it. oh well at least i have a couple of good friend. id die for you sam deb and lauren! well oh well time to move on i guess. i had cheerleading today as usual. good practice i think. and OMG we are dancing to britney spears holy shit oops i did it again holy shit are the coaches on crack or are they deaf? we almost have a tick tock (a lib where she switches feet) and a grl who can do a back handspring and an aerial ( cartwheel with no hands) excited!! i hope we win because we have put so much effort into this and its a crying shame if we dont. saturday we have a 5-hour practice for the day before competition ugh but we need it. hair party on saturday im going to get cornrow-braids for the competition score! gtg i hope i see you at hofstra for our competition!! bye bye!

o.O.o and here are some of the stuff we're doing at competition (ps the grls arent us idiots)

"event","cheerleading yesterday...had a jolly good time. i still cant do a cartwheel but i can roll;)angela taped us when we were doing our routine funny to see what we looked like. we looked like shit bc it was the first time we did it in like 3 months. we got better though im stuck in the back i dont get im captain and im good but im in the back i just dont get it. i started singing when ppl were trying to concentrate. i messed them up hehehe.  Danica wanted to *try* her round off and i kept singing ""wheres ur head at at wheres ur head at"" i got in a little bit of trouble:\ i got to sit out for a while bc i my stomach hurt. we didnt stunt thank god i was soaked in sweat anyways cause we did the routine 20 times. Game on saturday yeayy! i painted my nails yesterday pink and black. the grls gonna tell me to take it off bc its not squad colors bull shit. me and kaitlyn started hitting eachother and ourselves once again we got in trouble.. but not really bc the coach is 21 and she likes me *shes faking it* i wanna go to the mall just bc ill go with my sister if she comes home today. i want to see confessions of a teenage drama queen which is funny bc i hate lindsay lohan but i read  the book and i liked it. why are hilary duff and lindsay ruining all the potentially good movies out there? oh well ... Sams coming home today or tomorrow YAY!!

"event","Well sorry for not writing sooner ive been...um...uhh...i havent been busy i just havent been writing. Nothing good happened so i just didnt write for a while. so on friday the 13 i went to Jess's black belt party. Congrats jess, after years and years of lessons you still cant beat me up but at least you got a nice new belt and you get to be called Sempai Braunstein (sexy kind of)The party was at fat pipe t'was a little fun. A lot of people were there including deb<3 lauren<3 rob<3 and kat and michele kelly kristen dennis and a lot of others. matt had a pet pizza everyone was petting it and it was really strange but hey its matt. DDR as usual repulsive game really if i wanted to make a fool of myself i could do it in the privacy of my own home and not in public! Banging ur feet on some arows is hardly my idea of FUN but ::golf claps:: to jess justin aj and matt for making it look easy. The sexy sensai's came over and hung out for a while :karate did them good: i wish it did the same for jess oOo im kidding shes my sexy jessy but sure is pretty weak. interesting encounters with dennis in the back of fat pipe... he was all over lauren and i paid him a buck and i got a lap dance. Frankie was showing how he got strip searched :his fine ass turned me on ;): and two drunk ninth graders came in and scared me and deb. Lauren almost got in trouble but i found out that her dad didnt even know. story in a nutshell: jess is an idiot...lauren cant hang with jess...jess was at fat pipe...police bc of some unknown reason...cathy calls laurens dad...he comes the best part... HE HAD NO IDEA SO LAUREN WENT INTO A HISSY FIT FOR NOTHING! fun night. Saturday V-day- my sister was my valentine and she took me to a *****(five star) restaurant called McD's and we went to see fifty first dates i <3 adam sandler. Although i didnt have a valentine (( besides my sis )) i got two pairs of earrings and clothes SWEET! thats it really and ill write more later when i get back from weight  watchers joy! ::regrets eating pizza at party:: 
I miss u sam!

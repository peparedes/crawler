"event","In 2003 I finally got a personal computer and it was while surfing the world wide web that I came across a story called Touch of Perfection by Kender. That one story opened my eyes to a new genre of fiction and it is a genre that I still read in 2015. I loved this story so much that I had to tell the author, who was kind enough to share thoughts and ideas with me. Especially when I told her that I had been inspired to try my own hand at fanfiction writing, using her story as a template which she graciously allowed. Not sure if anyone still uses livejournal but here is part 1:


<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">SEDUCTION BY MOONLIGHT</span></span></span>
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">by Sandra</span></span></span>
 
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  The invitation read &quot;</span></span></span><span style=""color:#00007f;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Come Be Seduced By Moonlight</span></span></span><span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot; on a midnight blue background in silver lettering. The card was waiting on Riot&#39;s desk when he returned from the Battle of the Bands. Just thinking of the trip brought a smile to Riot&#39;s face, remembering the taste of the last passionate kiss he had shared with Rio. The memory made his emerald green eyes gleam. Bringing his attention back to the card, Riot wondered who sent it and why.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  Across the plaza at Starlight Music, Jerrica Benton was wondering the same thing. She too was holding the midnight blue card with silver lettering that read &quot;</span></span></span><span style=""color:#00007f;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Come Be Seduced By Moonlight</span></span></span><span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;. Turning the card over revealed a date and time plus the name of the newest hotspot, &quot;</span></span></span><span style=""color:blue;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">After Hours</span></span></span><span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;. It was this coming Saturday at 10:00 p.m. Losing the Battle of the Bands to The Stingers coupled with the sudden turn in Rio&#39;s attitude greatly unsettled Jerrica. She and the Holograms needed something to lighten the mood. This invitation could prove to be just the answer.</span></span></span>
 
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  Rio was sitting in his office at Starlight Music trying to get some work done when the phone rang. &quot;Thinking of me, by any chance, Love?&quot; came the soft voice over the telephone line.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  The pulse of heat running through Rio&#39;s body left him breathless with desire.&nbsp; &quot;What can I do for you, Riot?&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  &quot;Dangerous question to ask, Rio.&quot; came the laughing reply. &quot;You might be surprised by the answer.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  The suggestion in Riot&#39;s voice turned the heat in Rio&#39;s blood into a raging fire. Rio fought to not give voice to the moan rising in him. This stunning man already had far too much power over him and it scared Rio, a little. The depth of his emotions concerning the blonde singer were very overwhelming.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">On the other end of the phone, Riot could hear the whisper of Rio&#39;s quickening breath as well as the rising tension in his voice.&nbsp; <i>Ah, beautiful, beautiful man, you can try to run and put distance between us but you will learn that you belong to Riot now Rio</i>, he thought, bringing his mind back to the reason for the phone call.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  &quot;Have you spoken to Jem or Jerrica today, Rio?&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  &quot;No, not since we got back to town, why?&quot; caution entering Rio&#39;s tone.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  &quot;I received a mysterious invitation and wondered if perhaps Jem or Jerrica had gotten one, too.&quot; Riot answered pretending he hadn&#39;t heard the suspicion in Rio&#39;s voice.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">  The cause and reason behind all the speculation was relaxing in the back of a stretch limo. Moonlight is her name and she had come to take the music world by storm.&nbsp; And anyone looking at her would say that all Moonlight had to do was stand still to rock the world.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Long black hair with one streak of pure white framed a face that could and had stopped traffic. Unusual eyes of clearest silver stared out at a world that would give her anything she wanted, had Moonlight but asked.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Saturday would see her plans begin.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">On the other side of town, Eric Raymond was doing his level best to calm Pizzazz, lead singer of the Misfits, down. It was bad enough that The Misfits hadn&#39;t been invited to the Battle of the Bands, now Pizzazz was throwing an even bigger fit. The Misfits had not been asked to play at the upcoming concert for the President. Finding out that Jem and the Holograms plus The Stingers would be headlining the show only made it worse.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;What are you doing, Eric, sitting on your ass all day? First we don&#39;t get to compete in the Battle of the Bands and now, Jem and the Holotwits are playing for the President, instead of us!&quot; Pizzazz screamed, fierce green eyes flashing murder.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Eric ducked as another vase was thrown at his head, his own eyes starting to flash in anger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me, Pizzazz; blame that pretty boy Riot for this. He has completely taken over Stinger Sound and made his word law.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;I thought you owned half of the company, Eric?&quot;&nbsp; was Pizzazz&#39;s sneering reply.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;Not anymore, dear Pizzazz, thanks to some bad business deals and trickery on Riot&#39;s part, he now owns 75% of Stinger Sound. I am just a little Indian to Riot, just like you.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">But, maybe not for long, thought Eric as he patted the jacket pocket with the midnight blue invitation in it. He very much wanted something that would put Eric on top of the game again, instead of pretty boy Riot or that bitch Pizzazz.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">It was very late in the evening when Rio finally got back to his apartment and all he wanted was some food plus a long hot shower. But the moment he stepped into the apartment, Rio became aware of the heady aftershave.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">The scent burned through him like fire.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">It was Riot&#39;s special brand. He had told Rio that it was special blended and that Riot owned all the rights to the scent, preventing anyone from wearing it.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;I thought maybe you were wrapped up in Jem or Jerrica&#39;s arms.&quot; purred the husky voice from Rio&#39;s living room. Reclining on the sofa, looking as if he owned the world, was the cause behind most of Rio&#39;s recent sleepless nights.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;How did you get in here?&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;Well, it seems as if the apartment manager is a devoted fan of The Stingers and when I told him I had important business with Mr. Pacheco, he was only too happy to let me in.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Riot watched the purple-haired man standing in the doorway, feeling the desire pulse along his skin, waiting to erupt. He stood suddenly, stalking toward Rio like a hungry lion after a tender treat. Amethyst eyes widen at the look on Riot&#39;s face.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Rio moved backwards until the front door kept him from going any further.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Riot didn&#39;t stop moving till Rio could feel the heat of the singer&#39;s body. Placing his hands on either side of Jem&#39;s road manager&#39;s head, Riot leaned in to whisper in a shell-shaped ear, &quot;Do I frighten you, Mr. Pacheco?.......or perhaps this frightens you.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Before Rio could speak, Riot captured his lips, nipping gently at Rio&#39;s bottom lip, sliding his tongue softly into the moist cavern. Bracing his hands on the door was the only thing keeping Rio on his feet.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Riot could feel the moan coming from the younger man as he ravished the sweet tempting mouth with his own. Pulling back, Riot whispered against Rio&#39;s lips, &ldquo;Shall I leave now, Love?&rdquo;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">The answer was fingers tangling into golden curls to pull Riot in and kiss him deeply.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">When the need for oxygen began to overwhelm Riot, he backed away from Rio, caressing his lean, handsome face. The other man whimpered at the loss and leaned in to continue the kiss.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">But Riot was nowhere near done with this luscious man.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Smiling wickedly, he bent and heaved Rio over his shoulder. The surprised laughter coming from the younger man was sexy music to Riot&#39;s ears.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;This is crazy, Rory, put me down!&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;Oh no, Love, not until I have had my way with you. I want to kiss, caress and lick every inch of your exquisite body.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Hanging over Riot&#39;s shoulder, Rio suddenly felt as if all his bones had melted away. Wrapping his fingers in the black silk of Riot&#39;s shirt, he gave voice to a low moan. The images Riot&#39;s words invoked overcame Rio&#39;s senses.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Riot walked toward the bedroom, knowing exactly where it was from wondering the apartment before Rio got home.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Rio wanted, no needed to feel the touch of Riot&#39;s skin against his own. Those pale hands bringing every inch of his body alive with sensation.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;Rory,&quot; Rio whispered, &quot;What are you doing to me?&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">With a small lurch, Riot dropped Rio onto his bed. Rio laid there as if he didn&#39;t have the strength to move. The singer stood looking at his lover, laying on the bed in a white dress shirt and jeans that couldn&#39;t hide a growing erection.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Smiling, Riot answered, &quot;Rio, I am going to make love to you until you can&#39;t think straight.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;I already can&#39;t think straight when you are around, Rory.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Riot smiled gently at the use of his given name.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&quot;Oh, why think when you can feel.&quot;</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Then the only sounds that could be heard in the apartment were the moan of two lovers coming together in passion.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">The lovers were unaware of the black limo parked across from the apartment building. Even if Rio or Riot had seen the limo, it wouldn&#39;t have occurred to them to believe it had anything to do with either man.</span></span></span>
 
<span style=""color:black;""><span style=""font-family:courier new;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">They were very, very wrong.</span></span></span>"

I am a 46 year old woman who still lives with her family and has never lived on her own. I can tell you there is a very good reason for that, like money and so on but that is a lot of BS. Because of the actions of two men in my life and the innocence it shattered, I am emotionally and physically unable to act and be a so-called mature adult. I feel like a teenager trapped in a body and life that I will never be able to escape from. I don&#39;t say these things to cause anyone in my life hurt but I am simply tired of pretending to be something I am not.</p><p style=""margin: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""></p><p style=""margin: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""> I am alone in my world, I don&#39;t have a group of friends I go out with. Those I think of as friends live a distance that makes such outings few and far between. I do have a family member that I talk to and confide in but I feel very much the downer for this person as I am not the fun-loving type of person. I spend most of my down time reading, watching MV&#39;s on Youtube and watching T.V. Exciting life, isn&#39;t it? &nbsp;I don&#39;t party, would much rather sit and fangirl with those who understand my own set of strange likes. </p><p style=""margin: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""></p><p style=""margin: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">  I love Korean pop music.

I tried to listen to the music of today but most of it seemed to be about being pretty, rich, popular and as I am none of those things................. &nbsp;Maybe that is why I like Kpop, I can just let the emotions of the singing translate what I would like them to be about, even if I am wrong.

And it isn&#39;t just looking, if you want to call it yaoi, slash or M/M...I love reading stories as well, books and fan-fiction.

"event","<span style=""color:#800080;"">The past few weeks are pushing me past my limits. Or I should say this whole year. First there was the disaster with my Kia that was not only testing my nerves but draining my bank account. After weeks of going back and forth with repairs that weren&#39;t working, it seem as if a ray of light finally shone through. Thanks to a little luck and another chunk of money from the savings account I was able to purchase a new car, at least newer for me, a 2010 Chevy Cobalt. For awhile it seemed as if things were improving and the rest of the year might be worth it after all.<br /><br />Not so...............<br /><br />Several week ago my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. On the 29th of May she went in for surgery and now she will have to face a round of chemo and radiation starting towards the end of June. I want to be able to help her but I am already so tired and there is more to come. I am not sure I have the strength to be the main caregiver in this family. I am getting little to no help from my brother who lives in this household too. He has a special needs child who my mother was the main caregiver for. She was the one who got her ready for school and spent the most time with her while I was at work. His only job was changing and bathing her. Now with Mom going through this, how am I suppose to hold it together?<br /><br />I don&#39;t think I can. My head hurts all the time and all I want is to close my eyes and sleep. All I want to do is to escape into the realm of dreams and never leave. Is that a wish for insanity?&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Sandra</span><br />"

A Leo has a presence and power that you find intoxicating.
Sensual and playful, you'll be thrilled to have your Leo pick you as a playmate!

Why a Leo will love you:

You're willing to let your Leo be the center of attention (both at home and in public)

"event","I didn't think that depression could hit me this fast, it has been years since this kind of black feeling has overcome me.  I look around at my life and wonder why I ever bother anymore, I am so unhappy and the pain is almost unbearable.  Work is a struggle, Mom leaves me feeling drained and numb.  I would scream if I thought it would do any good, but I doubt anybody would hear me.  More and more I find myself just wanting to sleep and sleep; it use to scare me when I got like this, was afraid I would never wake.  Now I feel a sense of peace and seek that sleep more.

Is this a death wish???


I don't know...maybe.  All I know is that I am so tired.  Right now there is only one thing that brings me any kind of joy and those I live with make me feel like shit for seeking that little bit of happiness.

You are a gentle soul, with good intentions toward everyone.
Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

"event","Last friday at this time I had just returned from Lexington after seeing Brokeback Mountain and after a week I still can't get that movie out of my head. Having read Annie Proulx's Close Range/Wyoming Stories, the collection of stories that has Brokeback Mountain in it, I knew storywise what was going to happen.  Still I was caught up in what is a true human love story and by the end was weeping like a heartbroken child.  There have been very few movies that have had that effect on me, I could count them on one hand.  The love and heartbreak between Jack and Ennis had me gasping for breath, as if my heart were being squeezed in my chest. Also thanks to this movie, I have fallen completely in love with Jake Gyllenhaal...LOL  He is sooooooo beautiful!!!!!!!!  If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it.  This is not as a lot in the press have called ""a gay cowboy movie"".  This is a love story about two human beings who because of the outside world cannot be together.  And that is the true tragedy that had me and so many other who came out of the movie crying our eyes out."

"event","Went back to work this week after taking time off for OhayoCon, then a week's vacation.  I soooo did not want to go back to work, kinda got use to being able to stay up late, read GW fanfics and sleep late in the morning...*sigh*

OhayoCon was a total blast, ran around with Cherokee, tkmaxwell777 and my cousin starshinehigh. *makes a mental note to watch self around TK and Jo, the two of them nearly killed me with the giggles on friday night*  This year I was able to get video of Scott and some of the other VA's, so I can go back and relive some of the memories...that will have to hold me until OhayoCon '07'  Although the con was great and I had so much fun, it did end on a bit of a sour note.  On sunday morning when Mom, Jo and I went down to the main programming room for the panel with Scott McNeil and Michael Dobson there was a small line formed at one end of the hall and two girls who were named the 'slut twins' by a nameless source were telling any who arrived that there was two lines, one for those attending the panel and signing and another just for the signing.  Sounds reasonable, right.

Wrong..........


There was no two lines and those who were standing in the panel line were told that they would have to be last in line for the signing since the panel with Scott and Michael was cancelled.  With my hurt knee, I was in no shape to be at the end of a long line, so with Cherokee we just left to hit the dealer's room one last time before heading back to Kentucky.  I did leave my 'Scott Stalker' t-shirt with Cherokee as she said she might head back to the signing later, if it was still going on.  


It was......  


She called me later that day and told me that they had put Scott and Michael outside the main programming room and they were still signing at 5pm.  The signing started around 11am that morning and those poor guys weren't given any kind of breaks or even lunch.  Just hope this doesn't sour them on coming back again.  Cherokee did get both of our t-shirts signed by Scott *he is such a sweetie!* and she sent mine back to me, came in yesterday's mail.  If Scott comes back for OhayoCon '07', I hope to get a pic with him...missed out this year....:(


Well, it is time for bed, so Good Night to all!!!

I really can't wait for this, have a surprise for Tonja and seeing Cherokee again, plus the surprise for Scott.

It is just that the one thing I am truly looking forward to, well...I feel like it is being threatened.  Between work and family, I feel like I am so tightly bound that I can't move one way or another.  OhayoCon is the light at the end of the tunnel and the one thing keeping me sane right now.  I keep praying that the days will move quickly. But for now, I think I will close my eyes and go to sleep.  Work tomorrow, you know.

"event","Have you ever wondered if fate hates you and nothing in your life can go right?  I find myself thinking about that more and more.  I love my family, but my mother is going to drive me fucking insane.  I get the feeling more and more that I have the letters A.T.M tattooed on my forehead.  Since when am I expected to pick up all the money slack in this family.  I don't mind helping out with some of the bills, but dammit...I am the only one.  I am angry right now because in January I am going to OhayoCon *crosses fingers* and have been putting money away here and there, got a nice little bundle going.  But tonight my mother tells me that she will more then likely be borrowing it to make the down-payment on her new car.  Why the fuck am I the one she looks to when she needs money; my brother is living in the same house too.  I don't see him paying any bills, except child support.  If I could swing it right now, I would be out of this house in a heartbeat.

"event","I had such a blast at Ohayocon that I was really sad when it ended.  After the con I only had to go back to work for two days before I was off for six whole days.  A much needed vacation, I might add.  Got to spend six days sleeping...lol  I really didn't want to go back to work.

Ohayocon was better then I imagined.  It was way bigger then Sugoicon with more to do, bigger dealer's room and more guests.  Greg rocks!!!...and Scott is awesome!!!  Met Vic Mignogna and am now a fan of his too.  At his and Scott's signing, I thought I was going to laugh myself sick over some of the stuff Vic was doing with this puppet a fan gave him.  I managed to get not one, not two but in fact three hugs from Scott McNeil. I was told that he was a hugger, but until now I hadn't really been sure.  I am *sure* now...LOL  I am such a fangirl now, it isn't funny.  Got a picture with Scott and one with Greg, but missed out on getting one with Vic... got pulled away by Scott...LOL
Am already planning on going again next year, January 6-8, 2006.  I have been told that Scott, Greg and Vic are already confirmed to be there...LOL   366 days to go...lol

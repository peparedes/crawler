"event","Yeah, been kinda pre-occupied with stuff so not had much time to even think about posting let alone do it ^^; I got a chance to catch up with Catherine an' have seen Iori a few times and Mina... Well, she's livin' with me now. It feels pretty good havin' her here all the time <3 Plus she totally cooks for me even though i keep sayin' she doesn't have to! You readin' this? YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT!

It is kinda nice, though <3

Work is goin' pretty good an' soccer is too, but it's damn cold! I don't see so many people joggin' in the mornin' as I used to in the summer. Also in the first two weeks of January, all those 'new years resolution' runners, I guess. We keep gettin' snow warnin's! Ai-chan loves the snow! Mina an' me take her for walks in the park with Hanuman - it's pretty awesome how well those two get on!

Probably gonna come back to Japan for a visit, soon - tryin' to work out if 'tousan will be cool with Mina stayin' as well as me, I don't wanna leave her here, where's the fun in takin' a trip by yourself?! I mean, sure I wanna catch up with everyone (Hikari, it's been way too long! *hug*) but still! Mina should come, too. Yeah.

Oh yeah! I invested in a wii last month too! It's pretty fun! Got the whole wii fit thing and some games, too. The Resident Evil soundtrack is terrible in an awesome way~! I played the games in Japanese before, but I saw them in English so I got a couple of 'em 'cos they were real cheap and the first came with a soundtrack... Jill sandwich XD

Work time, I guess~"

There was wine then, wine an' stupid, petty revenge that I don't even wanna think about today...

Iori was pissed, I've never seen him so mad! He's still here now, sleepin' of the couch, I was kinda worried about him... I think I feel worse for him than I do me, I don't even know why I feel so terrible! Not like it should matter, right? I'm not with Takeru anymore, he can do what he likes, right? I don't care~

Wow, news! Had a lot of free time lately, major snow storms here, so very little soccer to be played. Not been busy at the cafe, either, Maria's been teachin' me a lot more bakin' an' such 'cos of that, so that's been cool ^^ Didn't get into Parma, kinda okay with that really~ Got another six months on my place so I'm here 'til the summer now - Paris in the summer is pretty amazing, so I'm kinda lookin' forward to it bein' warm again, not that the snow isn't awesome!

That I made a big mistake an' that it's gonna end up hurtin' people who don't deserve it. Did I make the mistake...? Yeah, I guess I did - Takeru might have left me for someone else, but that didn't mean I had to go off an' find someone else before I knew what I really wanted or anythin'. I'm so stupid, not brave at all, I didn't wanna be alone an' when I got the chance to help her an' feel important to someone else again...?

I took it like the stupid, weak idiot I am.

It was... Nice.  The grounds are amazing, the training facilities are mind-blowing and the dorms are TWICE the size as they were at Saint Germain's! The whole place was just really way impressive and it would be just AMAZING to actually get a place there, but... 

I dunno, Takeru kinda took the amazement out of all that and diverted it to himself instead - not meaning too probably, but still, he never really ever needed to try with me, you know? - whether I should have let that happen or not, it just kinda did an'... 

I can't decide whether I'm allowed to think that's good or not. I'm with Mina now, I'm not supposed to wanna be alone with Takeru anymore, certainly not 'like that' - I mean we weren't, we didn't do anything 'cos no WAY would I do that to Mina! Even if I didn't know how much it hurts, I just wouldn't - but it was so like things were before it was weird knowin' they weren't that way anymore an'...

...

We had fun. We hung out, saw some sites, did our joggin' thing (that's going real well! I'll be fit again in no time! =o^^o= ) an' then we came home on the cycle, him holdin' on to me the whole way an' me tryin' to remember things had changed, things had changed, things had changed...

Workin' right now, on my lunch break, but I need to call Mina when I get back - I gotta see her, talk to her... I don't want Takeru back, I can't do that, not now, no matter how much I still care about him but I don't wanna lie to Mina, not for a second.

I should've gone. Takeru was right - friends after what we had is just too hard."

Patamon was there, he said some stuff that... Well, it made it sound like Takeru's been havin' a real bad time, you know? An' that... That things would be okay again if we were back together. I think him an' Michael broke up, too. I dunno for sure, he said there was somethin' but he 'didn't wanna tell me 'cos it might confuse me' which... What the hell?! What does he mean?! 

He said he talked to Hikari, maybe I should call her? I don't wanna go behind her back, but if he's got somethin' goin' on that involves me, then he should tell me, right?! I mean, he always said when we were together 'I'm not made of glass, I won't break so easy' an' now he's not tellin' ME stuff to proptect me for whatever reason an' it's drivin' me CRAZY!

It doesn't matter what he says, I'm with Mina now an' I really care about her, so...

I love Mina. I know I do. Takeru had his chance an'... Well, I don't wanna say he messed up, but it's gone now an' I wanna be with Mina! She's way awesome an' I love spending time with her! She's pretty an' kind an' carin' an' understandin' an' real strong, too!

You an' Yamato should save it for your next annivesary, you know?! XD It was great though - I kinda miss the beach over here~ 

Went to 'tousan's early the next mornin', made him breakfast in bed an' gave him a plane ticket so he can come see my new place in Paris without complainin'! I can't wait!

I mean, first of all me an' Mina - it's been real nice.I mean, I'm glad! Glad like you wouldn't believe 'cos I really didn't know what I was gonna do or say but... It's real nice bein' with her so much an' not havin' to be all... Hidin' stuff, I guess. It does feel a little weird, but I guess that's just 'cos she's a girl an' nothin' like 'Keru, him an' the fact that he IS a he bein' what I've been used to the last four years, you know? Mina's so great though an' I'm... yeah, i think I'm happy again ^^ I really should thank her for that, I didn't think I'd be able to be REAL happy with someone else after me an' 'Keru broke up so I guess it's kinda a big deal, huh?

Then the party, that was... I don't even know! Mina was drinkin', much like everyone else, but I didn't really - just had a beer to seem social, you know? I had to go see 'tousan the next day 'cos it's father's day in Europe an' since I got 'Kaasan somethin' for European mother's day... Yeah. Still, everyone seemed to have fun, that was good - seems like forever since we all got together and just 'had fun'. Normally there's someone missin' or somethin' to talk about or just plain awkward~ 

There was skinny dippin', probably due to the alcohol, but I sat that out - way too many questions buzzin' around in my head to wanna be naked an' wet with two of the people causin' them, you know? I skipped the bottle game too - bad memories, I guess. Well, not bad, but I kinda don't need memories right now either, although I did some interesting things... cathrine and 'Keru kissin'... That was weirder than him an' Kenny kissin' somehow. Urg, I dunno...

'Keru and Yamato's song was pretty amazin'! Made me a little... sad, I guess... I dunno, I still really care about 'Keru, I kinda made my peace with the idea I always would, but seein' him playin' an' lookin' both happy an' sad at the same time... I dunno, should that still hurt? I talked to him later, he said things with him an' Michael were bad an'... Was I glad? No. I felt kinda bad that I was happy an' he wasn't. Is that weird? I dunno, Kenny came along then so we just kinda talked an' stuff - I'll have to catch him later an' find out more. I'm allowed to still worry about him an' want him to be happy, after all~

Finally, livin' alone is way harder than I thought... It's nice, havin' my own space an' an actually place I can call 'home' after the last couple'a years of not really havin' any such place to call that. But it's lonely too. An' there's lots to remember - like to pay the bills >_> I mean, most of the utilities are covered in the rent - like the net an' water - but not the electric so... yeah ^^; After a couple'a nights without it, I don't think i'll forget again!

The rest I guess I'll put where people can see, I wanna introduce Ai-chan to the masses XD She's so dam CUTE! I think Demi-veemon's kinda jealous... At least he can't say she gets better food than him, not after he figured she did an' actually tried it, anyway~"

"event","Well. I did it. I told her. I dunno, I've been real bad at writin' in this thing lately, what with movin', workin' more an' the whole electric thing gettin' messed up but basically... I told Mina how I feel about. Well, how I'm pretty sure I feel about her... It's kinda weird, it's not the same as it was with Takeru, but I still feel like it's right, you know? I guess I'll never get anyplace if I compare everythin' to takeru, though - it just can't come close, can it?

Nah, first love never dies, does it?

Still, I'm worried. Things have been gettin' worse for at home, her brother an' her dad just... Christ, it's horrible, so wrong! We talked a little yesterday an' she joked about runnin' away... I kinda really wanna believe she wasn't completely jokin'... I mean, sure I don't have a lot of cash right now, but I have my own place an' she'd be safe there, so...

I dunno, it's a way big step, I was with takeru for four years an' we never even talked about these things, but... We're all older now, right? If I had my own place then, I guess I'd have said somethin' so... I dunno. I just want her to be safe an' if she's with me? I can make sure she is, you know?

I need to talk to Steve, too. I mean, I met up with Mina an' i told her how I feel but... Even if this 'thing' with me an' Steve IS just sex, it still makes me feel bad about not talking to him first, so 'course I will - just when he's less sick. Which I hope is soon. I don't wanna hurt him, but I don't wanna drag anythin' out either, you know? I hope we can still be friends... he helped me a lot, you know?

*sigh*

Then there's Takeru. Somethin's up there an' he won't tell me. I guess he doesn't have to, but I thought we were friends? I don't ever not wanna be close to Takeru, but I dunno how we can be friends if it's just me thinkin' that way... He asked me what was wrong an' I told him. Yeah. I told my ex of four years I loved someone else before I told her AN' asked his advice! Isn't that proof enough he's important to me?!

I dunno why, but I think it's somethin' to do with Michael... He doesn't seem right somehow an' he's gotta be happy with school an' havin' his own place - he's wanted those things for way long now! It's gotta be him...

Unless...

No.

...


But yeah, the party, too. I don't think I wrote about that either, did I? ^^; It went pretty well. Team France helped me set up, Catherine was the perfect hostess (an' I was the perfect gentleman, givin' up my bed on my FIRST NIGHT for her) an' I think everyone had fun. Takeru helped me work out the washer-dryers downstairs, which wasn't so hard, but he left pretty early, the rest was okay though ^^ I wanna do somethin' like that again when I have more time but... We'll see.

I guess for now a lot of my time's gonna be taken up worryin', huh? ^^;"

Can't.

Yeah. House-warmin' party = pretty good.
Havin' own place = damn awesome.
Having to work twelve hour days = sucks. 

Even more so three hours sleep an' no damn electric. Long story, at work now so I could update but yeah, my whole buildin' has no electric an' I can't sleep so I'm wanderin' the streets of Paris at almost 2am~

I dunno, somethin' to do, I guess...

At least the food's good?"

My main living area! It's not massive, but still bigger than my dorm room and that's JUST one of my rooms! The kitchen area is where I was standing to take this, kinda behind the table? The bedroom's up the stairs where you come in an' the bathroom is behind the unit with the TV on it ^^ The main window stretches along that whole front wall and the sofa pulls out into a bed too!

<img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/larlar_ulysses/Daisuke%20stuff/kitchen.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket"">

Kitchen area! This is kinda small, but it's got an oven an' fridge an' such, so I can cook pretty good there ^^

<img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/larlar_ulysses/Daisuke%20stuff/chare0101.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket"">

Bedroom! Pretty small, but it fits my bed in, so I don't care XD

<img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/larlar_ulysses/Daisuke%20stuff/bathroom-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket"">

Bathroom! It's kinda old fashioned an' a little ugly, but not like I'm plannin' to live in there or anythin', right?

<img src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/larlar_ulysses/Daisuke%20stuff/buttesdown.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket"">

My awesome view! Zoomed in a lot, so you can see it better, but isn't it awesome?!</lj-cut>

How awesome does it look?! =o^^o= I'm also real glad 'cos they have wireless internet in the buildin' an' the cost is included in the rent so I don't need to pay or get a phone line! I can just use my cell an' the net XD Most of the furniture was here already, but it's all pretty nice an' Catherine's gonna help me organize the odd bit later, when Christophe an' Henri go home. She says hey too XD

Oh yeah, before I go? House warmin' next weekend? Let me know if you can make it ^^"

"event","I don't even know where to START! I mean, I was lookin' back over some of my other private posts, and it seems like things have always been complicated, but this much?! Damn!

Okay, so first, there's Takeru. He's always first, always will be, I guess, but I kinda thought I had it sorted out in my mind, you know? I kinda figured  that it was over, for good this time, but then I saw him yesterday and... I dunno. We talked about so much stuff, more than we did when we were together, an' it was good. Great, even. I've missed him so much, I knew that, but I guess what I DIDN'T know was just how much I'd missed having him as a friend even more. That's kinda weird, huh? I dunno where we stand now. I mean, we're friends again, we can talk, even about Michael an' stuff, but I dunno if I can ever draw a line under us an' that... I dunno, I really don't. I will always love him, I don't need to worry about forgettin' that an' I think he'll always love me too but the rest is up for grabs. I feel kinda good about it, kinda sad too but also good. It doesn't hurt anymore, maybe I just needed him back in my life. To tell him he would always have a place with me an' know that i could talk to him again. I guess I need to wait an' see~

Next is Steve. Steve, Steve, Steve~ Man, I dunno what that's all about either @_@ We meet up, have sex an' most of the time that's it. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's weird, you know? I've never been involved in anything like this before an' it's SO HARD to know what to think of it all! I mean, I'm all for 'if it feels good? Do it' but everythin' was so different before an' I just can't decide if that's a good thing or not! I do know I like Steve though, he's cool as well as... Well, you know... But that kinda makes the whole thing worse.

Finally, there's Mina. Yeah. I'll be kiddin' myself if I didn't admit, if only to a personal LJ entry, that I'm drawn to her in a way I probably shouldn't be >_> I feel kinda bad about it, she's so sweet an' kind to me an' I'm not even bein' honest with her. I mean, sure, she might feel the same way if I did say somethin', but I kinda dunno what to say! So much is goin' on right now that it's impossible (not to mention unfair) for me to say anythin' before I know how I feel, right? She probably thinks I'm all gay anyway, which is probably a good thin' - I'l just hide behind my boyfriends for a while an' forget I'm supposed to be the bearer of the crest of courage >_>

It's all such a mess..."

But yeah, not workin' much this week so i can hang out, but that's cool, I got me quite a good stash of cash now ^^ You know, Marie, the chef at work, she's been teachin' me bits an' pieces an' the other day she asked if I'd be interested in cookin'! Me, cookin'! Hahaha! That's kinda funny, but she said I was real good an' so I dunno... The soccer things goin' kinda... Nowhere. I have 'til October to get signed or I'm without a team an' it's not botherin' me as much as it should - maybe that says plenty on it's own, huh?

Not thinkin' about that yet, though! Just hangin' out ^^"

I mean, me an' 'Keru, I never thought it would stop hurtin' <small>(an' I guess it hasn't really, I can just kinda... Ignore it now, I'm dealin' with it, you know?)</small> but I guess this makes more sense than just findin' someone to replace him  properly, you know? i kinda don't wanna ever think anyone could replace my Takeru...

But yeah, had a little get-to-gether at my place ion paris, got kinda drunk an' before I know it everyone's gone me an' Steve are in bed together. Not at all a bad way to end a party, believe me, just kinda unexpected~ We've 'met up' a coupl'a times since then, I'm startin' to think this is a pretty good idea just... I don't get why it feel so not good at the same time.

Well, not hidin' really, just busy, I guess. Been takin' extra hours at the cafe when I can to save up for a p;ace to stay, I mean, once I hit nineteen? I technically don't have a roof over my head any more, bein' in the 'under nineteen' squad ^^; Christophe said I could stay at his place, but he's kinda out of Paris in Autun, so it's not ideal... I mean, the dream is to get called up to the under twenty-one's squad where they'll actually PAY me to play~

So yeah, Daisuke Motomiya, thinkin' ahead - who'd have thought?! Got some good savin's goin' on an' am working almost full-time once I get back from Easter break, but you can never have too many friends or too much money, am I right? XD

Which reminds me, Catherine an' I will be in Tokyo a week tomorrow ^^ We're both gonna be at my 'tousan's place an' I'll have my Japanese cell phone on as soon as we're back so like... call us, yeah? ^^ Catherine's gonna be goin' back Thursday evenin' to spend Easter with her family, but I'll hang around until the end of April, so yeah. There you go.

Dude, there's lots of new DD's poppin' up on here, how awesome! We're gonna have to have, like... A big get together or somethin!"

Takeru an' me broke up. That's all I'm gonna say an' I'm only sayin' that 'cos I'm guessin' people will be talkin' about it anyway.

Tatum turned up Wednesday evenin' an' we spent our time watchin' old movies, eating junk food an' such - it was good, I think I needed that, as much as I kinda didn't really wanna see anyone at the same time, ya know?

The next day, Tatum called Catherine before I got up an' they dragged me out, first to the cafe for food, then shoppin' an' lastly to a movie. I actually had fun! It was weird though, havin' fun... They kinda attacked me in the clothin' store ^^; I HOPE no-one has photos of that... The film was pretty awesome too! <i>'The Haunting in Connecticut'</i>, good movie! 

Tatum went home then an' me an' catherine talked. A lot. I feel a lot better about stuff now, I dunno how to thank you for that, Catherine, but I'll find a way <3 The park is real pretty this time of year, too - kinda cold, but you can see all the green things tryin' to fight their way back out of the ground an' live again - seemed kinda symbolic to me, that.

I'm gonna go see her again in a bit, just wanted to, ya know, get somethin' up here before I left~ Still plannin' on coming back for Easter, but I dunno how long for now - depends who wants to meet up an' such, I guess -  so let me know! ^^ Catherine's gonna be with me for the first weekend too."

Totally! I mean, I guess it depends on the situation a lot of the time, but like... If you really care about someone an' really believe in them then I kinda think I'd give more than a couple of chances to them, you know? Sometimes you can't help carin' even when you know you really probably shouldn't, I guess. That probably makes me kinda stupid~

It's Mother's day here in Europe, I sent 'kaasan a card, even though I guess I didn't have to. She called and sounded real happy! What a thing to come up with that question, huh? ^^;"

But yeah, the weekend party thing was pretty cool ^^ I mean, you guys were there, so I don't need to go on about it or anything, but I'm kinda glad Catherine and Tatum, talked me into stayin' over an' callin' sick into work <small>(although if my boss works out the area code I called from was in America, I'll probably be in for it ^^;)</small> it was fun hangin' out an' makin' brownies with you guys, makes up for missin' out on the fun in the morning (was there REALLY pudding throwing? WHY would people wanna throw pudding?!) *hug*

Do I need to say it was good to see 'Keru? Probably not, that's a given, yeah? *grin* It was though, hope you liked your birthday gift <3

An' now it's back to trainin' an' work~ I can't decide if stuff's gotten more hectic since I graduated or not... I mean, I'm putting in more hours at the cafe an' at the gym too, but the gym is more out of boredom so I guess it's not that I don't have the free time, it's that I dunno what to do with it when I do, ya know...? I'm glad Henri and Christophe hung around the place, I'd DIE of boredom without them - and Catherine, of course - but yeah, back to it, I guess.

I'll be home next month for Easter, though! I'm lookin' forward to that! I get a month out of trainin'? But I think I'll be back for two weeks so I can get some extra cash workin' the holiday an' catch up with Catherine an' her friends some more too but still! Home for Easter! Where I'm stayin's not been decided yet, but I guess I'll work it when the time comes ^^"

I mean, sure, it was HIS party so I guess he had lots of 'hosting' an' stuff to do, but I did kinda think that he'd, you know, find some time to spend with me once that had all died down and everyone had broken off into their little groups~ But he just kept dissappearin' an; I guess probably it wasn't on purpose, Michael seemed to keep turning up whenever I was about to do or say anything to him that went beyond 'general conversation' so I guess he just felt weird about it or whatever so...

Yeah, probably bein' paranoid.

It was just EVERY TIME I went lookin' for him, that's where I found him - with Michael, ya know?!

Maybe I'm bein' stupid, dunno, but it seemed kinda weird seein' him so... I dunno! He seemed a little different, I guess, an' that makes me feel weird for reasons I also dunno...

"event","Wow, been a while, huh? Sorry, been busy with school an' all that 'fun' stuff -_- Speaking of which, Friday was the worst though - stupid mock exams. I thought I was supposed to be done with all that bull!

At least I had a nice surprise Friday evening when 'Keru turned up for the weekend ^_^ That was fun~ *grin* To a point, at any rate... <small><strike>Talk about bitchy, seriously!</small></strike> What is up with everyone lately, seriously?! It's like everyone's had a complete personality transplant of somethin', damn!

But yeah, whatever. In a bad mood."

"event","I'm <i>supposed</i> to be comin' home tomorrow. I say <i>supposed</i> because my plane tickets haven't come through yet so I dunno what's gonna happen now... Can't stay here - everyone goes home for Christmas. Can't get home unless I go via the digi-ports which... I dunno, somethin' tells me that's not a smart idea so probably shouldn't, I guess...

Probably end up staying with Christophe or Henri or maybe Catherine - dunno. REALLY dunno, dude. It sucks. Gonna miss 'Keru as well as 'tousan and Veemon and even 'kaasan called an' asked if I'd go see her one day over the break but now? 

Sucks."

"event","Okay so I should be packing but I can't be bothered. Christophe got a Nintendo wii for his birthday a couple of days back and we've been playin' wii sports all weekend which is pretty awesome, I gotta say! Its' so wet and dull out over here right now that's pretty much the only thing worth doin'.

Which is why I'm excited about my trip! I still gotta go pack though, I hate packing, dude! Sucks...

....

Christophe says if I win this round he'll do it for me! SCORE! XD"

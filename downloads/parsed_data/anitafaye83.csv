"event","I realize that it's been forever since I've updated, but that's just the way it goes.  I would first like to say that I have quit my job!!!  But not completely-I will still be working for the same company but in a completely different location and with a totally different population.  I will go from working with ex-convicts to working with the developmentally delayed.  Not exactly what I want to do but you know you have to start somewhere!!!

Other than that nothing major.  We still haven't sold our house, my mom and Brian are still fighting about the divorce, and things at home have hit an all time low.  Oh well I'm out of there in like 18 days...not that I am counting or anything :)

Peace out"

"event","I should really be working considering I have slacked all weekend...but you know what, I just don't care I am tired and the radio is pissing me off-enough is enough with the stupid christian music already!!!

This weekend at work I got my ass kicked in all the following activities:
-Pool
-Darts
-Monoply
-Super Mario Brothers 3
You may ask what I did win at-hmmm that's a tough one...NOTHING.  That's right I got my ass handed to me in everything I did, I hate it but it was a good lesson for me.

So much stuff to blog about but so little time.  

I am going to be in Whitewater this coming weekend December 9th (One day tour only), and then the following weekend December 17 (Two day tour).  I will call you if you are important-or you can call me and make me feel special!  

Later Yo"

"event","So I have a chunk of information to lay on you guys now considering I haven't posted again in like 2 f'in weeks.

We will start, like most other posts with a run down of the most current going backwards.  Hey, you gotta blog about what is freshest in your memory!

Saturday night I text message Jenni to see what she has planned for that Sunday-hey I don't make plans in advance well-I normally forget about them or double book myself so tight I can't make it to the second one even if it is the most important event.  She was like-well I will be studying but then after while I will need a study break-hmmm ok sounds good I say.  Well I devise a plan to go her house to watch The L Word and have a few beers.  Nothing major-considering Sunday is my usual drinking day anyways, so I figure we will watch a disc of the first season-drink the 8 beers I brought over, and then I would just go home.  Topher is in Michigan for business so I don't want to get too wasted because I can't spend the night on his apartment floor.  Well we drink the beers I bring over, and then the ones she has in her frig, and then a bottle of wine, and then another half of bottle.  Needless to say, I am pretty wasted.  Don't get me wrong I can handle my own but damn!  So she was like you can stay here, it's not a big deal, I mean I have a spare room with a nice bed in it, which is better than what you have at home even *I told her about how I sleep on a couch at home because I don't have a bed*.  So we go upstairs-and I have been through her house before so I know where the spare bedroom is so I go in and try and find the light switch, but I can't so I just lay down-who needs a light on when they sleep anyways-well most of the time I do but I was just going to deal.  Then Jenni came in and was like you know what-these sheets haven't been changed since my brother and his girlfriend were here-I don't know if you want to sleep on them.  I was like it's ok-better than going down to sleep on the sofa, and she was like well you can sleep with me in my bed.  I think to myself-well I am wasted and it's not like anything is going to happen she told Topher that all she wants is to be my friend so I decide, what could it hurt.  I don't normally sleep with anyone so I tell her that I am a cover hog, she said she doesn't mind.  So whatever...We go lay down and the next thing I know her feet are intertwined with mine-she's ""cold""...whatever.  Well then her leg was inbetween mine....hmmm this one is harder to explain, but not as hard as things that followed later.  Well when I finally shut my eyes for the last time its like 7:30am, and I know that she has to be up at like 11am to get ready for work.  Oh well all I had to do that day was be around for the kids so it didn't matter to me...I'm a horrible person!

Ok, now let's rewind to two Sundays ago-I went apple picking with Topher-we had a blast.  Note to all people out there:  Topher and I are evil when put together when we haven't seen each other in appx. a week.  Needless to say we weren't the typical apple orchard goers.  We didn't know what kind of apples we wanted, we demanded service even though there was a line, we were acting extremely under our ages.  But dang it all we had fun!  Then Jenni and I had movie plans, so we went to see Elizabethtown.  It was pretty good actually-I was a bit leary but I went along anyways.  You should have seen her face when I enacted the one seat rule.  She was like umm...are you kidding me, it feels like you are so far away.  I don't want to have to yell to talk to you, but I held my ground and sat my one seat away.  For those of you who have been to a movie with me you know how difficult it is for me to sit next to you.  After the movie, we called Topher because I like hanging out with him and she is starting to come around to the testosterone influence.  But as we were sitting there, listening to the same songs being done by the same people, Jenni came up with the idea that we should go to the cities righ then and there and go dancing.  This is why I like her so much.  She is completely spontaneous but yet always has a plan.  So we drive to the cities, drink some extremely strong drinks and then get back in the car at bar time and drive home.  It rains the entire way home-I personally hate driving in the rain so I don't want to talk too much and distract Jenni, but I want to keep her awake so we have blurps of conversation the entire way home while Topher is sawing logs in the backseat.  Literally snoring so loud that it made the rain hitting the window seem quiet!!!  So we got back to Eau Claire and I got a hug from Jenni and then went to Topher's to sleep off the night.

That's about it for excitement in my life-well besides the fact that I almost sent a guy to jail this past week because he was being a pain in my ass at work.  After that you should have seen the guy's attitudes turn around.  They think that I am just this push over that won't yell or send anyone to jail.  Ummm, hello I have sent a guy to jail already what makes you think that the second time will be any harder than the first!?!


Well...I will blog again soon-hopefully fun things happen over Halloween!!!"

I looks cliche from the previews but nothing hits home harder than this movie about true friendships!  The daughter from ""The Gilmore Girls"" is one of the girls, one of the girls is from the movie ""Thirteen"", and I know I have seen one of the other girls in a movie too but irregardless, it is a must see!  Just be prepared, that means have tissues out.  If you don't cry during this movie there is something very wrong with you!"

"event","HAHAHA-I totally missed one of the best stories that happened between my last two posts.  

Stephanie and I were talking and she mentioned that one of her classes was suppose to have a couple of people in wheelchairs come in and give a presentation, and be present for questions from the class.  Well we started talking and I was like if Alex aka #3 is there you should ask him a question.  And then Stephanie comes up with not just a question, but an awesome question, something along the lines of ""So, you being in a chair, that makes it ok for you to be an asshole?""  I thought this was super funny considering he is somewhat of a giant asshole-some days.  Well I was talking to him a night that weekend, and I casually bring up the question of whether or not he had given any presentations that week.  He is dumbfounded so I know that he hasn't, and tell him the story of Stephanie being in one of the classes and how we were kind of joking about how she was going to ask him a question-without of course telling him what the question was because that would just be rude.  But he comes back with this plain old retard response-""Is that all I am to you, a joke?""  I was so taken aback by this question that I actually laughed out loud!  Was he kidding me?  Did actually not remember that all we ever were or ever will be is something that is open for joking and ridicule?  Come on, it's nothing.  

Dumb boys-Honestly!!!"

"event","Aggghhhhh, it's been a month almost, or so it seems!  I survived my 6 day stretch.  I am glad to say that it was worth it, I got that next weekend off-something I haven't had in a long time.  It was much needed, almost as much as a retail therapy trip is due :).  I spent my weekend off down in Madison, I drove my dad to work one day, so we got to spend some time together.  Then, Friday night I hung out with my step-mom.  We actually had a good time-we went for a fish fry, and had a bucket of shorties apiece.  Wow, I hadn't drank just beer in a long time so I was 5 sheets to the wind, even though it was probably only like 8pm.  AWESOME start to the weekend!!!  Then Saturday night-yes the night of the Badgers game against Michigan *who by the way we hadn't beaten in something like 16 games*-I watched the end of the game at a liquor store with Stephanie.  We went back to the house and slammed, and I mean slammed a sixer, 2 bottles of wine and then went to the bars.  My step-mom drove us down there, and was like don't call when you need a ride home, which was fine!  Long story shorten considerably-Stephanie and I hung out all night, we went to Bull Feathers, and Shamrock *the downtown gay bar*, and then to The Pub.  At The Pub is where the night turns from great to fabolous.  This guy literally pushes Stephanie out of his way, and ""doesn't"" realize it until I give him a dirty look.  Well then he and his hot, and I mean HOTT!!! friend buy both of us a shot.  The one who ran Stephanie out of the way automatically starts hitting on her, and the HOTT!!! one and I strike up a conversation just because our friends are talking.  Well bar time comes and they offer to find us a cab, because we came from the North side, and even though my dad walks it, I refuse to in my little kitten heals *which I admit were the stupidest choice of footwear ever!*.  So, Brian-the guy that Stephanie was talking to-and Stephanie are leading the way, trying to find a cab for us.  Well Brian decides that he is just going to run out in front of cars that he thinks are cabs, and narrowly misses getting creamed by a Topper's delivery truck.  Mean while the HOTT!!! guy that I am talking to-his name is Pete or Peter depending on what I screamed out...anyways I digress-is walking along with his arm around my shoulder, and holding onto my purse strap so it won't slip off.  I was so smitten with this guy it wasn't funny!  Well the end of the cab ride home story is that Brian ends up giving a cabbie a 75 dollar tip just to take us home...yes his total charge was for 100 bucks!!!  Agghh, I can't spend that much on anything let alone getting strangers home.  Well I am sure he thought he was going to be greatly rewarded.  But my step-mom-who when is drunk sleeps really soundly-woke up and saw me with a guy on the new couch and asked who was the boy.  I was like which one-she didn't find this very funny!  I on the other hand thought it was a witty retort.  She later said that we were to strip our own beds and wash the linens.  Oh, well what are you going to do?  Over all it was well worth everything I had to do the next day in  my hung over state!

So Sunday, in the midst of my hangover I go to have lunch with Adrian-a girl that I truly think is an awesome person, and used to work with at the most laid back job ever Steck's.  Hanging out with her on her LSATs prep. lunch break was exactly what I needed, I needed to tell my stories from the night before and hear what was going on in Whitewater from her perspective.

Ummm, not much else has happened since then.  I do the typical go out on Sunday night with Topher and his new guy, we call him Porkie.  They are so cute together!  But as of just this weekend Topher is getting tired of him always being at the apartment, and just being generally agreeable.  

Also this week-Tuesday to be exact-I went out on my first date with Jenni yesterday.  We went to this little local spot that serves Cajun food, and has the best beers on tap.  I was kind of leary about meeting her one-on-one for dinner.  I don't want to say that she is unentertaining, but I want everyone to know that I can be somewhat shy.  Yeah, I know that you don't believe me, but it's the truth, so I was worried about her thinking that of me-or worse yet, think that I was boring.  Well needless to say that we held our own in the converstation department.  She did ask some very interesting questions, that were a little heavy for a first date, but I rolled with the punches and kept her laughing!  Then after dinner-I hadn't bored her too badly because she wanted hang out with me still and grab another drink.  I thought this was the best sign, until she wanted to drive us both to hang out with Topher and some of the people that he works with-that was ultimately the best sign!  I had so much fun hanging out with her when I didn't need to be the center of entertainment, she picked on a guy that was 30 with 2 degrees that works selling phones.  She found his lack of drive pretty interesting considering she is an executive at a local factory, is going to school for her masters, and owns her own house.  And little did I mention lives no where near her family.  I truly dig her ability to just move away and be independent!  All-in-all I am pretty interested to see what her faults are.  We are planning an L-Word marathon sometime in the near future because she says that I need to watch it.  I was like ok-I'm down for whatever!  She also reintroduced me to Ani DiFranco-Solare must be given credit for the initial introduction, but I never really got into it.  Jenni said that she is really good and then sat in the car and played me her fav. songs and they were really good, so today I dl'ed a bunch of them and burnt myself a cd.

*Sigh*  I am finally done, I think, well, yeah I am pretty sure that's all I can blog about today."

"event","Yes, that's right, I am working 6 nights in a row.  Yes, I will die by day 4.  I don't know what made me take the extra hours, I must have been wasted :).

Oh, well what are you going to do?  I know, not care, and rake in the extra money!!!!

So...Sunday night...I went to the gay bar, like always, and I met this person that I have been emailing for like a month now.  This person is pretty cool, but then they start to ignore me.  I was like that's cool...it's the first time they have been to this gay bar, and they are meeting the people!  Cool I get to help them meet new people, score extra brownie points for me.  Apparently not, apparently I am just this person that you meet, screw around with and then don't call or email for the better part of a week.  I don't know how to take this...I think that I am mad, but secretly, I wish that this person would just freaking call me!

Then, Monday night I took my mom to see The 40 Year Old Virgin.  I had to laugh out loud at a couple parts, because they hit home alittle too hard.

Then Tuesday, I went to Eau Claire and chilled with Topher for a while, and then by like 10:30-11:00pm, I was ready to go to the bar.  I can only handle so much hanging out with him without someone else around apparently.  Not that I don't love him, because I do!  So we walk in the gay bar, and of course I talk to almost half of the people because I know them, but the hot bartender who I would have sex with until my vagina fell out, was there and he was wasted.  I mean...WASTED!!!  He and I talked for a while and then he asked me how open I was.  I was like, huh?  He was like, well if I go like this *as he puts his hands from around the back of me unto my boobs* would you be offended?  I was like no, go ahead you are already there :D.  I couldn't stop laughing.  I can't wait to see him the next time I go the bar, I will be giving him shit!!!

That's it...work, movie, drinking...that's what my life consists of this week.  Sadly it's almost all work right now!"

"event","So my first and foremost crazy idea is that I want to become homeless, and live on the streets for an undetermined period of time.  I think that I have had enough of this rat race called life for a while.  I am tired of working just to pay to live.  I figure that I can live on the streets, and not work, and just really get in touch with what I have been missing working so hard for the last few years.  I know for a fact that 99% of the people who know me would say this is the craziest thing I have ever said, but I have really put some thought into it.  I mean I wouldn't just go anywhere, I would go south, and perhaps into Mexico, to just live life.  Most people who come from wealthy backgrounds do this in Europe why can't I do it in Mexico and the US?  I would just go missing so as I wouldn't have to worry about paying my bills, and I would just get what I need by trading work for basics, and who doesn't know someone who knows someone in at least every state.  I could just....live life free of the daily concerns that I have now.  Besides, I could use some real, raw life experiences.  How better to learn what people go through that have chemical dependencies than live like they live.  I was talking to the guys tonight at work and a majority of them have been homeless for more than a month of their adult life.  

The second crazy idea that I have is if this living on the street thing doesn't work out for me I just want to pick up and move away from everything.  I am tired of being around the same type of people.  I can only take so much of the ""I'm a hick, my parents were hicks, and I will never open my mind far enough to realize that my sister is my wife and there's something wrong with that, but gay marriage that's a person's right as much as marrying someone who is the opposite gender.""  I think I would move somewhere like California, or New York there at least people understand that we are a melting pot and that things work better when we just worry about ourselves and not everyone else!

Ahhhhh, Topher has been gone tooooooo long, I have had nothing but time to think about these things all week!!!  Thankfully he will be back tomorrow and if I need to I can get my fix of him before I have to go to work, which I think will be necessary!"

"event","So shortly after getting off from work yesterday I went home and crashed.  I had been up for, let's see all day Thursday, all night Thursday, all day Friday, all night Friday, and until 1:30 Saturday afternoon.  Wow, thats like 60 hours, ok that explains why I didn't get up until 8:30pm last night.  After that much relaxing much deserved sleep we went out to Eau Claire.

Like I said I haven't had off a Friday/Saturday in about 2 months, so it was going to be interesting anyways but then it was pride weekend.  I had so much fun and pimped Topher out both nights!  Friday night he slept with this kid whose name is Chris too.  He is cute but not cute enough for Topher, so of course when we saw him out last night Topher like blew him off.  Chris then came up to me and was like, ""Why won't he talk to me, we do things that I don't do with just anyone last night and then won't talk to me today.  I am so sad!""  My response you ask, but of course was something along these lines, ""Oh, well you know he is hot, and really doesn't care about those who he does things with.  Just be lucky he's not a widow spider!  At least you are still alive!""  He didn't like that very much!!!  

Tonight was the Drag Show at Scooter's.  I have never seen so many people there, and so many of them horribly dressed and shakin it like they own something.  But the performers were awesome, it turns out that a couple of the guys that I know from the bar do drag.  They looked amazing!  I have pictures *of course* and can't wait to share them and get prints!

Tonight at the after party that Topher threw there were 3 of the drag queens from the show tonight, two gay boys, and a bunch of straight people from the club.  I told Topher that if I caught him in the bedroom again, and not babysitting his partygoers that I was going to leave and the partygoers would have full run of the house that he was watching.  So as I was leaving at 4:30am from the after bar party Topher was out in the kitchen getting hit on by all of the drag queens, and the boy that he slept with the night before.  I had to smile to myself because it would be totally like Topher to pull a 5 person orgy in someone else's house.  

Topher is leaving for West Virginia today :(.  He will be gone all week :'(.  He is going there for training for his new job, he should have fun the company is paying for everything!  I wish I had a job like that, yes please fly me somewhere and pay for everything!!  I don't know what I am going to do without him all week.  It will be tough not going out and not getting my daily dosage of gay culture, I guess I will just save money :).

Look for later blogs on what exactly happened last night and this weekend, as memories surface I will blog about them!"

"event","Yet another Thursday night that I could be out and about in Eau Claire I am spending at work.  We got another new guy this week.  He is Hispanic, and very quiet.  It will be a nice compliment to the guys that we have in the house right now.  

So...I finally got another tattoo, for those of you that have one or two or twelve you know that they are an addiction.  Well it has been just about 2 years since I got my last one so I finally got one!  I got a Q on my left foot.  The letter itself is 2 inches by like 2 and a half inches.  The Q is filled in with green, blue, pink, and yellow in a fade pattern (the colors are bright and I love them!).  And then in the middle of the Q is the word MASK for my beloved pledge sisters, and the colors that fill in the Q are our favorite colors.  So it's my Tau Phi-esq tattoo.  Let me tell you, I will never NEVER get another tattoo on my foot!  I flinched so bad during parts of the process I am surprised that it turned out as well as it did! As soon as I figure out how to crop a picture I will load it onto here!  

I HAVE TOMORROW NIGHT OFF I HAVE TOMORROW NIGHT OFF I HAVE TOMORROW NIGHT OFF!!!  You have no idea how long it's been since I have had a Friday night off, it is going to be a low key night *I can't even type that with a straight face!*  I am planning on getting completely trashed, and it is Pride weekend up in Eau Claire so it should be an interesting weekend to have off!  I do, however have to work Saturday and Sunday mornings so I can't be too wild but I think I will manage to make the best of it!

Peace out!"

Nothing really new sadly, I had to work tonight because stupid co-worker called in sick.  It was supposed to be mine and Topher's first official movie night.  I was getting all excited, but no.  I got woke up from my ""sleeping time"" to be told, rather than asked, to work the night shift tonight.  Oh well, I needed hours anyways because I am losing 8 hours this weekend so I guess I should just suck it up, which I think I did considering I am here for the forth night in a row.

Yep thats it.  Oh, Stephanie called tonight she made me laugh for like an hour so it was cool!  I had to laugh at her though because she said that if I didn't answer the phone she would have just hung up, I asked because I don't normally work tonight so....

Alright there are a few guys wake now so I have to go.  Have a great day, I will be spending it sleeping :) :)"

"event","This was probably one of the craziest weeks ever.  For starters I went out with Topher, like usual, and he got so wasted on Tuesday that he decided it would be a good idea to bring home a gay guy from Eau Claire.  Not a huge deal, but it is when he hasn't told his mother, or family for that matter, that he is gay.  And, the guy that he brought home was so pissed off by the time that we got to my house *where Topher's truck was* because Topher had stopped being entertaining, and it was a 30 minute car ride back to Eau Claire.  I had to laugh when Topher finally woke up this guy and I were trying to get his keys so I could take the guy back to Eau Claire.  I haven't spoken to Topher since.  

That same night I met two drag queens.  The one was super liberal, and kinda cute looking, minus his bad clothing choices.  The funny story here is that there was this black guy hitting on me that night, and the queen and his ""queen"" daughter *more on that in a minute* stood up for me, and were like back up do you not see she's a lesbian interested in us just because we are queens.  A dragqueen that is skilled and knowledgeable takes on a ""daughter"" to show the ropes to.  Now, the daughter in this case had a lot to learn but would be cute after a little work.  I walked away with homemade drag queen earings.  I was psyched!!!

Newest drama on the home front is that Kyle hit me so hard that I lost my temper and slapped him back.  Now I never condone this behavior, and I regretted it as soon as I did it, but god damn it felt good just to give him back what he has been doing all summer long!  I have a grapefruit sized bruise on my left breast area.  Let me tell you, that is the worst spot to have a bruise, you never realize how much you move around until it hurts to move around.

I am throughly excited for having the nights off next weekend!  I don't really know what I have planned now that people are backing out of going camping, but I will have fun no matter what I do.  I will drive across country to if I have to!  I haven't had a weekend night off in I don't remember when, most likely before June 15.  Crazy it will be over 2 months.  That's a lot of going out on Monday nights ;)

Well for now I think that's it!  And if you know the 13 rules for circle of death please post them I will be eternally grateful, just for my own purposes!

Tonight Stephanie called me looking for the directions to Circle of Death.  I could only get her 11 of the 13 rules :( boo.  It was funny though because she called me while the residents were still awake, and they over heard me and came in the office and were like what are you doing, you work at an AODA place and you are talking to your wasted friends.  I was like yeah...at least I am not gone doing it!

I am super excited!  Topher called me and we have plans for tomorrow already!  Well that's not a huge commitment considering it's 4am already but still!!!  We are going to see Dukes of Hazzard and then we are going to our favorite spot, Scoot's for the last Queer as Folk episode ever.  It should be a fun night, hopefully I behave myself ;).

"event","I want to put this out there...Gay guys are the greatest things ever created by the man above, I just want everyone to know that!  Everyone needs to find themselves a good gay bestfriend!  They are there for you, they listen to you, and they pose NO THREAT!!!  I just got off the phone with Mike, an older gay boy that works with Topher.  Mike was like, Jonathon is here, I could put in a good word for you.  Jonathon is another guy that Topher works with, he is only 19, and is totally my type (taller than me, stocky, super smart in areas that I am not *read cars, electronics, etc.*).  I told Mike that Miss Thing (me) needs to handle her own business, but thanks anyways.  Only this could have made my night better, I love gay boys, they rock my socks!!!

Today was pretty typical, had to yell at Kyle to leave his sister alone.  No hitting though it was nice!  My mother of course walked in the house and blamed me for one thing or another and then at dinner *which I slaved over for like 3 hours* asked me what my fucking problem was.  Not just my regular problem, but my fucking problem.  Hmm, way to bring up the topic, you might want to rethink you approach if you want any answer at all *other than maybe a bitchy look, and a fuck you back*.  Rrrrrrrrrr!!!!

Yesterday, I made plans with Topher because we hadn't hung out for a while alone, just the two of us, and lord knows what happens when that happens.  We get too many bitch sessions built up and we spend the night getting wasted and bitching about our problems and not scooping the scene for prospects ;).  Well then my mother came home and informed met that she was going out.  Didn't ask me if I could watch the kids, but rather told me that I had no choice because she was going out.  I was like, well...I made plans already.  She was like they are just with Topher and you can have him wait til the kids go to bed.  I was blown away, and fuming!!!  Well, what are you gonna do when you are in my shoes, I just made plans for 10:02pm when the kids were in bed.  Then we went out and ran into Jonathon *a gay boy from Arcadia that I met through Topher* at the Hide Out.  We spent the night hanging out with him, it was fun because we haven't hung out in forever.  Nothing major happened, no making out, no strange houses to wake up in, but I did get a pretty good buzz going on, which I haven't done in probably 3 weeks,so it was a nice change of pace!

Monday night Topher and I went to Brian's house *he is a gay cop from St. Paul who lives outside of Menominee*.  He had prepared a 4 course Italian dinner for the three of us, complete with a white wine!  I was in such aww, the candle light had even his trailer looking good :).  Then, Brian tackled Topher in the living room, and I have lived out one of my fantasies, I can almost die happy now :).  We will leave you to assume what that means, and no I will never be drunk enough to tell you what all happened that night!

Ahhh, some how I just feel better after putting all my anger, well a slice of it anyways, down.  I feel like livejournal has become my therapist, and I think can handle that for now anyways.  

Oh yeah, a job update.  They guy that I really like from the house is being discharged from the program because of his injury without any hitches, which is awesome!  I am worried about him though.  He leaves this Saturday morning, and he is going back to his hometown area, which is the worst possible place for him to go, and he knows that but he is doing it anyways.  He tells me that he is going to be living with his folks until he can save up the money to move away so he doesn't fall back into the same rut.  *He just poked his head in and was like ""'Night Neeter!""*  God it is good he is leaving so I don't get fired :P.

Oh one more damn gripe.  I wanted to have off August 19-21 for a LGBT camping event that is happening in the area where I live, and I asked the other guy that works 3rds if he could switch with me for some days during the week.  He said that would be ok, but then on Tuesday he calls me and says, ""Well, if you could work for me tomorrow, and another day in the next week I will work for you those days.""  I considered it really quickly, and then I was like ""No, I have plans for tomorrow already.""  Had he given me a good reason, or any reason at all I might have considered it, but he was just like I have a thing tomorrow.  I don't think that's an excuse, plus I don't want to have to work during the week more than I have to right now considering I have to watch the kids.  So, instead of him being a grown-up and just sucking it up and switching the week days for weekend days the week of the camping thing, he now says that he has ""something that weekend"", and that he ""just found out about it on Wednesday"".  What a fucking liar, I watch children, I went to school, I joined a sorority, I wasn't born yesterday I know when someone is just being an asshole, and if he were a woman he would have earned being called the C-Word.  Oh what the hell, he is a CUNT!!!!!

Well now that I feel better I suppose I should get back to work, or something that resembles it at least :)."

He tore his ACJ, or something like that in his shoulder, and since it is a work based program, and he can't work because he has only one good arm, he might be discharged from the program.  I then learned that he has 7 and a half years left in prison if he is kicked out of this program :(!  After a while I went out to have a smoke with that guy and another one and they were telling me all this stuff about the program, and how the new PM has got the right idea, and that I rock!  I was pretty pleased, but then I had to realize that I could not show my appreciation.  Before this all happened I was told that Brian *My step-father* would be taking the day off tomorrow, and having the kids all day, in regards to what happened yesterday, read on for the story.

Yesterday, that was a day from hell!  My brother got braces on, and he was so crabby after that, that my mom said to me, and I quote, ""I am going out and my purpose for going out is getting completely wasted, just so I can forget about the bullshit of the day!""  I have never heard my mother talk like this.  Before my mother could leave my brother locked himself in her car, and refused to get out.  This was a battle for 25 minutes, in which my mother came in and bitched at me for just sitting in the house.  When in fact had I got out there to help she would have bitched at me for that, I know this because I stuck my head outside and she nearly threw something at me. Hmm...I am the bad guy, ok fine.  Well she finally gets to leave and Kyle chases after her.  I have to run after him, does anyone else see a problem with that??  I had to chase him through the woods, and eventually he came back down and got on the four-wheeler, narrowly missing me *I mean had I moved an inch I would have had to go to the hospital*.  He then stopped the four-wheeler and hit me so hard that today I have a grapefruit sized bruise on shoulder.  When he finally came inside he called his father right away, and yelled, and screamed at him for a good hour on the phone.  Then said that Brian wanted to talk to me.  I was like...Ok...., but then I got on the phone and Kyle threw a huge fit, and the only thing I got to tell Brian was that Kyle is like this pretty much every day.  I think this sparked the day off that was mentioned in the first paragraph.  WHAT A GREAT FUCKING NIGHT TO BE AT HOME!!!  Oh, then when my mom came home she was all hostile with me, demanding to know what went on, ummm....hello I was sleeping peacefully, this could have waited!!!!!

Two days ago, Tuesday, we hung out at Mike's house.  Mike is a co-worker of Topher's.  He is gay and awesome!  He has the nicest house I have seen in a while.  We watched Dairy of a Mad Black Women, I had seen it already but it was still good.  I met another one of Topher's co-workers at Mike's house that night.  He is 19 and super hot!!!  For those of you who know the type system (revised addition) he is a 1.

Monday night Mike, Topher, Dan-O, and Krystal Meth went to Scoot's and had some beers.  Topher passed out at the bar, it was all together embarrassing.  We decided to leave him in the booth and go play pool, well that was a bad decision.  There was a guy that was stumbling around when we got there, and he went over by Topher and was groping him by the time that I got over there.  I told the guy to get the fuck on and he went away.  Well that only lasted for about 10 minutes and he was back over there.  I told him again to get the fuck on and this time the guy started giving me shit.  I, being still sober, told him that it was in his best interest to get on before I made him get on.  Then all of a sudden I could hear myself talking really loud, the jute box had been turned off and everyone in the bar was watching what was going on.  The guy said the usual bullshit that I have been hearing since I was a little fat girl on the play ground *let me tell you maturity doesn't happen ever to guys, well the drunk ones at least*.  I told him that I would have no problem laying him out, and to that he said, ""I cooooould lllll-lay yo out twice, fat whore!""  I told him to go ahead, and he just walked out the door stammering some sort of retort.  I got a round of applause from the bar, and the music started again.

Hopefully this weekend goes by faster than I think it will, due to the lock-down.  Oh yeah, there is this GLBT camping thing that I am going to go to with Topher, Mike and some other gay guys.  It should be fun, hopefully I will be able to get off from work so I can go and have fun!!!"

"event","SSDD is how I feel currently.  I am almost falling asleep at work because it has been a day from hell today.  Kyle was being exceptionally naughty today.  Yelling and hitting are becoming the norm with him.  I finally convinced my mother to take him to the doctor.  He is going to the psychologist sometime this coming week.  He is going on some type of Ridalin or something because this behavior has got to stop.  Lauren is doing better, she is not showing so much passive aggressive behavior.  She is still thinking that she needs to yell at Kyle when he misbehaves.  Yet, it is getting less and less often.

I went out on Monday night with Topher.  I have never seen him so drunk in my life.  He passed out after being in the car not even long enough to buckle up.  It was pretty scurry...Well I guess that's what happens when you drink 2 pitchers, a couple bottles and cans of beer in about 2 hours.  We of course were at the gay bar in Eau Claire.  That is our favorite spot when we get together.  There are a lot of girls there on Monday nights, and then on Tuesday nights its guys night out.  I was sitting at the bar minding my own business when this girl out of nowhere sits down and starts touching my leg and talking to me.  I was like....ummm...ok...how are you???  She was pretty cool, for being too forward and barking up the wrong tree.  

Working right now, trying to pass the time.  It's just about time to make lunches for the boys.  The task doesn't sound too hard, and it's not but it is still my least favorite part of the night.  I have to make 24 sandwiches.  All with one thing or another that I would rather die than eat.  

I officially made an ass of myself at work tonight.  I was exchanging banter with the guy that is my favorite guy in the house and I said ""I only pick on the ones I like.""  Meaning that I only give shit to the guys that are cool, but I think it came out wrong and I think that they took it that I liked liked this guy.  Oh well, I have earned a nickname, so I think that I am cool enough now.  


Signing off----Speedy"

"event","I got a new job.  I am working at a 12 bed residential alcohol and other drug addictions treatment facility where I work 3rd shift so all of my posts will be from early in the morning for the normal person, but late at the evening for me and for insomniacs.  I really like what I am doing, I interact with the guys and then I get paid to stay awake.  You can't beat getting paid to play pool, fooseball, spades, etc.  The guys are teaching me so much about life, and what they have missed because of their addictions.  It has really taught me what it will be like to be a counselor, which is now my new focus in my professional life.

Enough about the daily grind, let's talk about something fun!  I went to Summerfest twice this year!  That is double the times that I have ever gone before!  I saw Styx, the Big Bang, Seether for like a second, and Gin Blossoms.  It was crazy to see the people that come out in public thinking that their shit don't stink.  I had a blast just people watching!

Went out with my mom of all people my first night off last weekend.  Sunday night me and my mom left the house at like 6pm and didn't get home until 12:30am.  I have never seen my mother so completely shithoused in my entire life.  She normally has one beer and is good for the night, not that night she and I did the Tour De Bars up home, and at every bar we went to she had a beer.  Those of you who are unfamiliar with the little towns around my home town, there is practically 3 bars to every church, and we are a religious area surprisingly.  All and all I think she probably had 8 or 9 beers.  COMPLETELY SHITHOUSED!!!  And a funny sight to see!

Hopefully I will be blogging more often so my life doesn't seem so bland :)"

"event","So, it's been a while since I have updated...What are you gonna do I know.  It is officially 2 days before I graduate and all I want is to have fun with the friends that I have made here in the last year and half of college, but no I am sick.  I fucking am always sick, I dont know what it is, but whatever it is it is becoming quite a pain in my backside!!!  That and I want to hang out with all of my friends but I dont want to hang out in large groups because the attention is too dispersed that way.  I have reached my limit, as the saying goes 2's a company 3's a crowd, and so on you get the drift.  So if you are reading this before I am gone for ever hang out with me one on one, thats what I truly crave the most.
Enough of the ranting, lets get started on the raving!  It's Ultimate Thursday, and it's my last one so it's gonna rock so hard core!!!  I am looking forward to getting to see everyone, and hopefully hanging out with them alittle bit individually so that I know that all things are right in the world before I leave Whitewater.
Crazy stories, ones that I wish not to remember and have been told things that I dont remember.  If you want to hear them, or have something to add to them let me know ;) I am always looking for more to add to the bank!!!

Well this is enough for me, I have to get some rest for later today is all that matters in a college year!!!!!"

"event","I just realized that I haven't blogged about St. Patrick's Day yet.  Well I am at work and don't want to type any more of the churches in the area into an excel file so I will take this time to let you all know the crazinesses that ensued on SPD.

I went out on Wed. night before SPD, and met up with Clint, Steve, and Clint's friend *I forget her name*.  We drink for seven dollars at the Pub because I went out with Solare so of course I had to go there or hang out by myself because Stephanie wanted to sleep, instead of go out.  Well, I got pretty bored hanging out with just this girl, we will call her Katie for the sake of this piece, at the Pub so we went to Pumpers and my favorite bartender wouldn't even serve her because looked wasted.  It was crazy, well not as crazy as the rest of the story.  Clint and I had to walk Katie home because she was so wasted that she couldn't be trusted in the car.  An HOUR later, we finally get to Wells West where she lives, an hour that's at most a 20 minute walk normally.  

After dropping her off Clint and Steve and I went back to my room, because they had gotten kicked out of the place that they were going to be staying.  We played Nintendo all night so we wouldn't fall asleep.  Well Clint ended up falling asleep anyways, so Steve and I thought it would be fun to mess around right next to him.  It was crazy.  

At 5:45am we get up and go to the bars, and get right into Pumper's and Mitchell's, where we get to drink for 10 dollars for 4 hours, and get a free tee-shirt.  I had probably 8 drinks, and was like I can't be in here any more so we went to get breakfast, and then to Sentry to get some pills for Steve so he wouldn't have such a headache.  Crazy part of this part of the day was when Steve walked back to the car with flowers for me.  They were so cute, and he said that they were for his favorite sorority girl.  *GAG*

We went back to the bars for the rest of our all you can drink, because it was only like 8:45am.  On my way back up to the bar I fell on my ass, and gave myself some pretty wicked bruises and a scar on the front of my leg.  I was messed up, I won't deny that!!!  Shortly after going back to the bar, I realized that I needed sleep other wise I was gonna break down *Hey I had been drinking for nearly 25 hours by then*.  So we hit up the Boar just because and then went back to my room to go to sleep.  

We get to the room and Clint says ""If you two are going to sleep together I am sleeping on the same bed too, damnit.""  So we pushed the beds together and the three of us slept together.  Clint rolled over and could very well have gone to sleep but I doubt it, and Steve and I fooled around again,disregarding the fact that Clint could have heard/felt what we were doing.  Wow, apparently no sleep and alcohol make me a very bad person ;).

I woke up and got ready to go out with Stephanie about 12:30ish, and left the boys in the room, telling them they should call me when they were ready to go out again.  I got a call about 2pm saying that they were just gonna leave instead of hanging out with me and Stephanie for the rest of the day.  Ok, fine bye, but then they stopped in where we were to say good bye.

Stephanie and I hung out til like 10pm, when I said I had to go to bed.  She was like yeah I do too.  So we peaced out early on SPD, but I partied for a total of like 40 hours!!!!!  That's hardcore drinking right there for you! :D"

"event","So last weekend was Celebration weekend, and for those of you who are unfamiliar with Celebration weekend in ""Anita land"" it is the worst weekend ever!!!  Not worst in a bad way, but more so in a drink-a-lot-and-want-to-die-way.  Thursday wasn't bad because I had to get up for my mid-term review at BB/BS, which I will describe as a whole nother drama, but Friday and Saturday were another story entirely!

Friday, let's put it this way, I don't remember much so there couldn't have been much in the way of drama, but a lot in the way of drinking alcohol!

Saturday, there was so much freaking stuff going on, and other things *insert wink here*, that I remember it in great detail.  This was the day that instead of getting drunk at 5pm with my friends I decided to take a little nap, which turned into a 4 hour long snooze fest!  By the time that I got to Celebration my friends were already in fine form, which was fine I deserved it because I didn't drink with them.  The night only progressed when we went to the bars and I had 3 Player's Choice, 7 Jager Bombs and a Blue Moon shot, in about 1 and a half hours.  Then, against my will, we decided to go to the Downstairs.  Usually I would have protested harder but I was already wasted and ready to dance.  Crazyness ensued from there, and if you would like to know the details from there you will have to ask me later, when I completely remember what happened!

Now onto my issues with BB/BS.  I heard one thing on the Tuesday before my review, and then I heard a completely different thing at my review.  Now I should be used to this because I have dealt with all sorts of shit before, but coming from a middle aged women I thought I could trust her.  Apparently no matter how old you get you will still say one thing and do something completely different!  I am officially fed-the-fuck-up with BB/BS, well as fed up as I can be and still go to work and be completely fine in front of these people.

I realized that I haven't written in a while, which no one reads this anyways but, writing in here makes me feel better so I am going to tell you about the weekend before last.  Friday night Stephanie and I went to Janesville for a change of pace.  We hit the usual Times, and Quotes, but then we decided to try and find the place called The Watering Hole.  Once there we realized that it was the dumbest decision ever.  The bartender was cute, but that's all the place had going for it, so we decided to drink our drink and get the hell out of there, not before taking some souvenirs though!  We each took our high ball glass, and a solid pool ball.  :)  Saturday night was equally crazy!  Stephanie, Dest and I decided to hit Sharkey's which is in Waukesha.  There happened to be a kick ass Dee Jay, and the Quervo Nation girls there.  We got free shots of tequila all night long, and some really cool necklaces that blink!  I was well worth the time that it took to get there!

Looking forward to Saint Patrick's Day!  I think that I am going out at 6am to Mitchell's to get my free t-shirt and all-you-can-drink drink's until 10am!!!"

"event","So I decided that I was sick of my hair color and had Kassia color it for me while we were waiting for Tau Phi's History night to be done.  Well it was 4 different colors, with black being the primary color.  But, with about 3 hours worth of time, and less than 20 dollars of coloring product it is now 3 different colors, and rougher than any grade of sandpaper known to man.  This has nothing to do with Kassia's coloring abilities, and everything to do with my stupid stubborn hair!  I just wish for once that it would do as I wanted, and not as it wishes!!!

History night was awesome!  I got a flip-flop, because it is officially that time of year!!!  The girls are going so well!  I am just glad that I am alumni and I don't have to try and find time to meet with them, although I wish I could!

I am officially half done with my month off from drinking.  I have decided on a day that I will start again, and it is *drum roll* the Friday of Celebration, which for you who care is March 11, just 6 days from St. Pat's Day!!!

Well I will sign off for now, I have to go deep, deep condition my poor poor hair!

Sleep well, and know that some one, some where loves you.  And if you are actually reading this, then I love you :)!!!!"

"event","I went out tonight with Lisa, Mary, and Stephanie!  We hit up Denny K's, which is probably my least favorite bar ever for multiple reasons.  But we played a quick game of 301 and then decided that we were going to head to the Grill.  Once at the Grill we wanted to play more darts, but there were guys playing so we waited.  In the mean time we talked about our ""types"", and why we were attracted to different ones.  Then we started talking about people in the bar, and trying to decide if any of them could be placed in our ""types"".  I totally called one guy a 1 and a 2 in my ""type"" and Lisa and Stephanie disagreed, and said that he was just a 2.  Turned out he later introduced us to his partner, and the was definately in both 1 and 2!!!

After leaving the bar, Stephanie and I went back to her place to eat our Topper's and to talk.  Mid-sentence I made her stop talking to I could point out a very important fact.  We had been talking about milk for over 10 minutes.  We talked about the nutritional benefits of milk, which type was the best for you, which is skim by the way.  We talked about how she only likes to drink Kemp's, but had to settle for Sentry brand.  Blah Blah Blah, I think you get the picture!  

Had a great dinner with the Tau Phi's today!  I was surprised that so many people came, and we all hung out!  I loved it!!!

Nothing else new...going home Saturday again to see my Gram, and my poor brother who under went surgeru yesterday."

I have done 2 home visits this week already, and my stupid fuckus doesn't get as good of gas mileage as the honda did :(  Oh well...I got to meet a former agent that still has a small agency, and I got to meet a true one parent family with some pretty smart rules.  

Working for BB/BS is probably the coolest thing that I have gotten to do.  I mean I get to help them, but I am not dealing with complete and udder devastation.  I like the mix!

I have gone an entire week without drinking a drop of anything alcoholic!  This is pretty good considering I went out on Thursday with Stephanie, and some other people and didn't drink anything even though I really really REALLY wanted to.  And, then I went home to Jamie's Last Resort and I didn't drink even though Chris was pressuring me to.  I am so proud of myself!  Only 29 more days to go!!!

Peace out for now, I am going to go have an old fashioned ASK night with the girls of Tau IX"

"event","So I have decided that giving up drinking for lent, when I am not religious at all, is pretty stupid considering it is my last semester before I graduate.  Instead, I am giving up drinking until just before Saint Patrick's Day so I can, to do the pub crawl for the very first time ever!

I finally got the Fuckus from my parents.  All it took was my poor little Honda overheating a couple of times, almost leaving me stranded!  It's name is Hubebe, because the letters of the license plate is HUB.  It is alot different from the Honda, mostly in good ways.  One of it's only draw backs is that it doesn't have a CD player, and my stupid parents are being anal and won't let me put my $400 stereo in it :( I am pissed!!!

My brother is having surgery on Tuesday, and I can't go home until Saturday to see him :(.  

This week is going to be hellish!  I have so many appointments to make for BB/BS, and other hours at my paying jobs that I am going to want to go out and have a drink, but I can't.  But at least I am allowing myself to have caffeine again!  Other wise no one would have wanted to know me :).

Other than that nothing major.  Went home, saw Christopher, Krystal, Tracy, and Lindsay at Jamie's Last Resort, my home town bar!  Where, coincidently my favorite band, 7-1-5 was playing!!!  I had an alright time considering every time I turned around some one was trying to pour their drink into my water.  Damn them for trying to make me not be not meet my goal!"

"event","Hmmm, so apparently I forgot that Saint Pat's Day is during lent, in addition to Christopher's 21st birthday.  Those are going to be the most trying days of my sacrifice right there.  What was I thinking?  I have to go through with it now though because I already told most people that I was doing it :(

So last night was kinda shitty, but I enjoyed my time because I got to my friends buy me drinks, and didn't have to feel bad, or worry about paying them back.  I drank a pitcher of Mountain Dew and Vodka, which now I can have neither because I gave up all mind altering substances, and half a pitcher of what was supposed to be an Amaretto Stone Sour, but didn't have any OJ in it, hmmm....funny how that works, and then a pitcher of ""Players Choice"", which was AMAZINGLY good!  That was all at Mithcell's, and then we went to The Mad Boar, where Bonnie was apparently!!!  And I had a purple drink that had the word bruise in it, it was good.  Then I tried to ask the bartender to give me a balloon that was from the Super Bowl but he shot me down quicker than I thought was even humanly possible! Oh well, I didn't really want it anyways!

We had to wait for Bonnie and Heather *I think that's her name* to be done drinking because Stephanie agreed to drive them home.  I ordered Toppers because it sounded really good, but then forgot so we were waiting for Bonnie and the Toppers guy calls, and was like ""Did you all order Toppers?  I have been waiting for a little while, where are you?""  I was like ""Shit, Stephanie we ordered Toppers....""  It was funny, the guy ended up getting a 5 dollar tip, so I don't think he minded!

And, just for the pure enjoyment I thought I would write my sacrifice on the wall of Mitchell's bathroom, just as a reminder to myself, and other that it is lent.  While I was writing something else on the wall, the lady bartender walked in and goes in her ""MOMMY"" voice ""What do you think you are doing, missy?"" I near shat myself right there, I thought ""Oh, no.  I'm going to get kicked out of my favorite bar."" but then she was like ""I don't really care, do you know how many times I have written on the walls, it's cool.""  So then I told her that this wasn't my first time, she was like thats awesome.  Madness and Mayhem, that's what last night was all about!!!!"

"event","So this morning I was having a bit of car trouble, yet again, and no one could take time out of their busy lives to help me.  Not even a fucking COP!!!  That's right, the people that I pay to ""Protect and Serve"" couldn't help me, but he had time to stand around in front of the Post office and bullshit with some local-yocal.  I hate this town!  I hate the people in it, I hate almost everything, with the exception of my internship!  

But the car trouble was fixable, just needed to add more coolant to the radiator, nothing major.  Stupid water pump isn't doing it's job!  To make matters worse I called my mother just to let her know and she said that it ""Might be something Dan (who owns a shop in Janesville, and happens to be related to me some how or another) should look at.""  Little did she know that I still owe him money for the last thing that he gave me the ""family discount"" on.

I went to Madison, also.  I got to sit around and discuss nothingness with my father's wife, while he was at work.  Then I decided, screw waiting for a phone call, I am just going to go down to State Street, and see what type of loonies were out!  I eventually found a bar, The Pub, that I thought was cool enough to go into, and ended up being hit on by an OLD, OLD man which didn't really bother me, because it got me a drink faster, and for cheaper ;).  Then I stood by the window, and watched this hippie chick dance to the music in her head for a while.  I then noticed that I was standing next to the hottest bald girl ever.  Who knew that being bald period would be attractive, let alone on a girl.  She had guys hitting on her the entire night, it was kind of fun to get to watch that.  Then, we noticed this guy, running from light pole to light pole, ""hiding"" behind them, all covertly.  It was humorous to me.

I left The Pub, and went tried to get into Waldo's but there were too many drunk people in front of me and the bouncer said he was done letting people in, it was only 1:30am, hmmm I think he was a dick!  But then I went to The Red Shed, older people bar, but there were still some pretty hot guys in there!  I was quietly singing along with the jute box, when all of a sudden, one of my favorite types of guys walks up to me and says sing it girly!  He and I hit it off, and blah blah blah........

I got lost on my way from where I was back to my dad's house, it took me like an hour to find it again.  I was so mad at myself for not being able to figure it out, damn one way streets!!!

I never got to see my dad, which made both me and my dad's wife pretty upset, but she is upset with him anyways, which is always fun to hear about, kind of if you like that type of thing.  

All and all I wasn't upset that I didn't meet up with the one person that I went to Madison to see.  Screw him, if only he knew what he was missing he would be upset."

"event","So I went out last night, and then I woke up this morning with a slight hang over.  But I don't remember what all happened, or how I got so drunk.  This is what I can recall drinking last night, 5 beers 3 jagerbombs (they are only 2 bucks all the time at my fav bar!!!), and little sips of Stephanie's Rum and Coke.  This is what I drink on a normal night, plus some, so I am saddened by my intolerance.

Bonnie was out last night!!!  YAY!!!  Stephanie and I lifted her up, apparently, so she could write our names on the ceiling, we really need to stop tagging at Pumper's and Mitchell's!  Other than that nothing major happened.  Except for Michelle was super strong last night, she almost completely avoided Brian, I love her for her ability to steer clear of something that is not good for her!

Nothing major going on this weekend either :(, but maybe Clint will come from Milwaukee and we could hang out, since I haven't seen him since he graduated last semester.  

Peace Out A-Town Down"

"event","Stephanie is probably the funniest girl ever!  She goes to me just a few minutes ago ""I don't suppose you know anything about annuities/monthly income statements do you?""  I think to myself, well, ummm maybe.  Yeah well I proved myself wrong, because it turns out that I know little to nothing about that stuff, but I try and bullshit my way through it :)!  

I am glad that I didn't go out tonight, this way I have an extra 7 bucks for going out later this weekend!  I, was on the other hand a little angry that it took me calling someone, not to name names, me calling that person twice before that person called me back.  Luckily Dest called me and offered me the opportunity to go out.  Sadly I was already in my pj's and talking to some pretty important people, so I decided not to get ready.  

Tomorrow, well actually now today, is gonna be interesting.  I have a few appointments around the area for BB/BS, and then I have to work at the liquor store with the lady that knows nothing about everything!  I am looking forward to it because maybe I'll catch a fake ID and get my 20 bucks for it!!!  

It's gonna be a long weekend, unless Clint comes to visit, I haven't seen him in a long time!  It would be cool to hang out with him this weekend, because Lord knows what will be going on.  

I guess Peace Out, A-Town Down for now"

"event","So Sunday night, I am lying peacefully in my bed when my cellular telephone rings.  Who should it be at this hour, I wonder?  I get up, angry that I was forced to move to get to the phone, and then I realize that it's my best-guy-friend Christopher.  He called ""just to chat"", so I knew there was something wrong.  He starts talking about his less than stellar weekend up home, and then it dawns on me that this was his weekend off, and that he normally goes to Green Bay to visit his ROCK STAR hot boyfriend.  Yes for those of you who are new to the Anita Realm, my friend from home is gay.  So I asked him what was up with that, and he said this and I quote, ""I told him that I was too much of a burden, and that he deserves better than what I can give him right now.  And that I don't want to feel obligated to drive there every other weekend, because we both need a relationship where the people live close enough that they can see each other on a daily basis.""  I wanted to cry while he was talking.  I have wanted nothing more in the past few years than for him to be happy, and for me to still be in his life.  I think that Brian was the greatest thing that happened to Christopher in a really long time, and I think that Brian is not going to take this news lying down.  Which really makes me feel good.

So we talked about other stuff for a while, but then the conversation started to drift back to the break-up and all I could do was make jokes, which I thought was inappropriate, but then he told me that's why he wanted to talk to me.  He said that just talking to me would make this seem less harsh, and he said that he trusted my judgment, and wanted my advice.  I love him so much!!!  So I was happy that I got up, out of my hungover bed and answered the phone."

"event","So I had to work until 9 at the stupid liquor store, where we were training in this new guy.  He's a good guy but I don't think he is gonna cut it unless he starts carding people!!!!!!  But other than that, nothing major happened, no fake id's no rude customers, all in all a pretty worthless night.

But then we, my friends Amy, Michelle, and Stephanie, decide to go out.  We go to Pumper's and Mitchell's first like always.  Body Shot was playing, good band but we only stayed for like 1 drink and a shot.  We then head to The Pub, where the most horrible bartender calls me a ""Cheap Bitch"".  I laugh at her, like that hurts my feelings.  I paid 3 dollars for an all soda, Bacardi Coke, and you call me a ""Cheap Bitch"" for not tipping you.  We go to the bathroom and tag the walls, the same walls that on April 25, 2004 couldn't be written on.  After my second Bacardi Coke, that had more Bacardi in it than ice :) we decide to head to another bar, with cooler people in it.  We end up at the Coyote where I swear to God that the guy bartender looks identical to one of the guitar players in Body Shot.  So I ask him, and he says ""Nope, I have been working here all night.""  Which I then turn to Stephanie and say, I think he's lying to me, so I ask him again.  I'm such a bad drunk.  Then we go in and tag those walls, which have been tagged before by us, but the management have painted, or tried to paint, over our tags.  Much to their avail we do it again!  After this I realize that we should probably peace out so we can get a cab, because it is almost bar time.  

So I call Brown Cab at, 1:50ish, just before they close for the night.  The lady on the other end assures me that there will be someone there to pick us up in like 5 to 7 minutes.  So I stand outside for what seems like 20 minutes, and then a cab finally pulls up and I, just to make sure, ask him where he's going.  This was his response, ""Your way if your headed to my house.""  *Jokingly I think* but still EWWWW GROSS!!!  No thanks old man, I'm waiting for my friends.  Then he says that he's going to some place on Tratt, not the street I need to go anyways.  He says he'll be back just to check, which I thought was pretty nice of him.  Ten minutes later he pulls around and says where you ladies headed.  Someone finally tells him Harmony Lane, we get there and I get out, leaving some other poor soul to pay my fair.  Sorry girls!!!  

This is where the fun should end, but it never ends at Stephanie's place.  We order, and eat food then Michelle passes out and starts snoring louder than I have heard any other female snore in my life.  Next to fall asleep is Amy, poor girl, she has to be up early Sunday morning for work, so we excuse her passing out.  Then Stephanie says, ""I'm just gonna lay here and talk to you.""  She climbs into bed, and within, I would say no more than 10 minutes, is sleeping.  Great, I'm awake and the three of them are either snoring or farting in their passed out states.  I think, ok maybe there will be someone fun online at this time.  Now that it's 3:45am who's online?  Yeah, that's right not many people.  I start talking to a person that I haven't talked to in probably a good 3 months.  We decide that I should go over and chill there for a while since we were both still awake.  Only thing is I realized that I don't have a winter coat, and it was pretty cold for those of you who didn't go out Saturday night.  But I figure I'll walk over there, and stay there for a while, possibly even crash there.  No, I walk there, my friend doesn't answer the phone to let me into the building, and I have to walk back to Stephanie's without a coat.  Yeah, needless to say I was pretty unhappy!  Then, we started talking again, and he wanted me to come back over, and stuff but I was like, nope sorry I'm far too cold for that, and I peaced out.  

Note to self:  Don't I repeat, do NOT sleep on a DLK apartment floor, they are not comfortable, nor are they warm.  I learned this lesson the hard way that night!!!  Also, do not drink so much so fast that you don't realize you are lit up like a neon sign, because in the morning you feel like you fell from a 3 story building, and then got run over by a mack truck.

So that was my Saturday, the first of many drunken nights, and hungover mornings of the new year!!!"

"event","So I feel like I have finally accomplished something for BBBS!  Today I posted a lot of ""Bowl for Kid's Sake"" posters around town and got a few donations for the raffle.  I also handed out some other donation sheets, so hopefully we will get something from them as well.

My car goes to get fixed tomorrow so I won't have to feel like I am hitching rides from people any more!  I love that some one in my extended family finally opened up a shop!!!

Funny story:  Last night I got up and 'needed' to get something, but ended up walking into the planter that is on my floor trying to grow tulips and didn't realize it til this morning.  Why I 'needed' anything at like 5am in the dead of my sleep I will never know.  Needless to say I have potting soil scattered all over my room and bed."

"event","Gave two shitty presentations for my job today.  I don't think that we will get any referrals from them.  Realized that I need to pick up the pace if I am going to make any money for BBBS's Bowl for Kid's Sake.  I think I am in way over my head here, and it's only gonna get worse before it gets better.  On the positive side, I sent out my first application this week for a real job in the real world.  Hopefully I will get a call for an interview, it would be the coolest job ever!  Stephanie, Kassia and I went to see Meet the Fockers, and laughed our asses off, not just because of the movie, but because of the guys that sat next to us.  These guys were real gems, drunk and everything!

Went out last night, had two pitchers of mixed drinks and a jagerbomb.  Just barely beat Stephanie at a game of cricket.  Got angry because someone vandalized our vandalism.  The proper spelling of our acronym is MASK, it never has, nor ever will be spelled MASKK.  I don't deny that our class has 5 people in it, but the four of us had something special and we now have the acronym to show for it!  MASK FOREVER!!! or SKAM whatever your fancy."

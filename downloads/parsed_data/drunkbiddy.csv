"event","So i have a dentist's appointment in Seneca Falls tomorrow at 12:45. Fuck. That's early for a day off...or any day for that matter. After that who knows, maybe I'll actually get some laundry done. The past few days, weeks, etc. have been a blur. I don't even remember what day it is half the time. The other day I woke up and started going into my day off routine until I realized that my alarm was set on my clock, then hitting me that it was Saturday and i had to work and whatnot. My job is not stressful or anything...I love it actually. But when there's only 24 hours in a day, working 8 or 9 of them seems like a fuckload of time. It can't help that I'm lazy or unmotivated. In my life of late, if something does not relate to music I love, drinking, naked women, or my friends, I want no part of it. The spiral continues..."

"event","So I was talking to Jean today (which is kinda nice since I don't give a shit anymore) and she bought me a membership to Suicidegirls.com. I'm in fucking heaven. Have you SEEN the women on this!!! I could never leave my house again and die a happy man. Plus, I saw some girl that poses on the site and she's from Rochester. I know I've seen her at Lux before. Me So Happy. Me So Horny. Me Love Naked Women!"

On another note, when the fuck did i start becoming some fucked-up male gigolo? I'll hit on anything with a vagina now. I guess it's better than when i could not talk to anything with a pussy, but still, maybe some middle ground would be ok. These extremes are killing me."

Anyone reading this is invited over to have pizza and see the spectrum of emotions i go through when the Packers are playing. I hurt today for some reason...it might just be life catching up to me, who knows. Then later tonight I'm going over to lux to see Karrie and bring her a shitload of cd's for the purpose of some new music kicking into that bar....This could be a real interesting day."

"event","So i'm sitting at work right now bored out of my mind. I'm the only one working tonight. It's pretty lame. I had aches of various types all day, but I seem to be better now. I better be better for Brian's birfday, or he'll murder me. I was looking at all of my friends journals regarding new years, and I've decided that It's best for me to not carry it out further other than saying that it was a night in which none of us died, hence making it a good night. Plus I was sexy. It's so dead in the store. I can't even go take a shit if i want to though, because there's always one or two people in here. Fuck. Oh well. The more that i think about it, the more i realize tonight could be the beginning of the end. I mean, Beth is leaving, It's Brian's birthday, and I am starting to lose my desire to drink every night. My throat is constantly shit, my body hates me, and I don't see my friends who don't drink/can't go to bars at all. I can't leave Lux and my friends there though...it's such a double edged sword. Who know's what will happen. I guess it's all one day at a time...and tonight's a drinking night"

Then we get a day to recover before Brian's Birthday party/Beth's going away party (tears). It's amazing I can still function after the abuse my body took last night. Anyways, nap time. 
P.S.- Shannon...If you read this give me a call around 8:30 to let me know if you got something for my crown. If not, maybe we can brainstorm. My number is 473-7957."

"event","Ok, so that's not really true, but the improbability that was the Packers getting into the playoffs (and some other things) has made me as happy as I have been in a long time. WOW. Ask John how nervous I was and how many tics I had as they let us know what was happening in the Arizona game. I'm fucking pumped. It's insane. God damn. Pizza, football, maybe some beer or napkins later....this is a quality sunday."

S'ok, i don't feel much of a bender in the cards for tonight, but a beer or 4 to relax sounds like a plan. The work situation is leaps and bounds better. I'm so glad the holidays are over...I think they were giving me the shits. Anyways, i better get going so that Brian does not think i'm jerking off to porn again. I'll go right after this Double anal penetration scene is over......mmmmmm...."

The shot of tequila the girl bought me might have had a chance to do something had i drank anything else, but my body was crying all day long. Tomorrow I might be back to normal, who knows...just so long as i keep seeing these amazing people on a daily basis, i don't care :)"

I have this picture on my desk now...all of us at Arigato last night. It actually makes me well up a little because all i wanted was my friends and to have fun, and i got it. I should start wishing small from now on. And to all of you who are reading this, Meet the new Boss..."

"event","Does anyone want to kill somebody/need a place to live? How about killing two birds with one stone, literally and metaphorically. One of my roommates is a complete cuntrag. As we speak, she is storming up and down the stairs looking for god knows what and, well,she's just a total bitch (which, by the way, is the ONLY thing she is good at with the exception of eating all my popcorn!). I used to think this girl was pretty fucking cool, a total sweetheart, someone who would be a friend to the end. Man, when I'm wrong I'm really wrong. All i think of when i have to hear her voice are the vile things i would like to do to her, like shit in her mouth or make her walk across broken glass face first. I'm an angry person at times, and man...she's not a bunch of help. I need Booze!"

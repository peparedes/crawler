"event","""Hi, big fellow..Joshua?""

Joshua's towering body shadowed the entrance to the tiny kitchenette. ""Hello, lil' fellow. Joshua cooking. Found a book. Cooking book."" There was a lot of  flour on Joshua, Max noticed as she switched the lights on. ""Oh, cool."" The half smile seemed convincing enough for Joshua, because he disappeared in the kitchenette again.

""What are you cooking, Joshua?"" Max tried to follow him, but he blocked her passage.

""Surprise. Joshua cooking surprise. Max not look."" He was giving his back to her, sidestepping so that she couldn't peek inside.

""Okay. Okay.""  Defetead, Max retired on the old couch, considering that one day they should try and cover a few of the springs trying to poke through each ass that was sitting on them. Boots up on the armrest, she flipped the channels on the old telly.

It was a little burnt on the sides. The tomatoes were squashed. There was probably too much mozzarella. But the smile on Joshua's face as Max asked for a second slice of home-made pizza was priceless."

"event","The night's work has gone well.  And it was fun. Climbing up buildings, B&E as quiet as a cat would be...Max wasn't exactly proud on being a thief, but hey, it helped paying the rent.
And her new bike was fantastic. Powerful, roaring, a real pleasure to hug it between her thighs and give it gas and just...eat the road.

Joshua is sleeping, when Max arrives back at the place she's rented. He snores. Max covers him with a blanket, then leaves the door ajar so that a little light filters in. He hasn't adjusted to the new place yet, and it's really tough for him to go around. What they had manage, is a wrapping bandage around his head, as if there are scars healing on his face. For the moment, it would do.

Boots and jacket off, a beer in her hand, Max starts flipping the channels of the second hand telly that came with the apartment.
Carol Sandeman. That was the name of the only woman that had opposed Manticore. Whatever her relation was to Father, as Joshua called him...she was the only one who had fought for them. She deserved a proper grave. 

Another couple of days, and then it was time to see if Krycek had come up with the goods.  
Damn, Joshua really was snoring the place down. Max turned the volume on a couple of notches."

"event","""She made herself vulnerable,"" Zack said. ""And now she's paying the price."" Then he went, and gave his life for Max. Her brother. More than that.

Moping around never was much of a habit, for Max. A few careful hits in the past weeks, and she had enough cash in her hands for a bike. That was a good starting point. With a bike between her legs, the world wouldn't seem too upside down.

After the bike, it was time to go and check if Krycek was as good as the underground had him. Although Max really wanted to put a bit more space between herself and the Halloween party. Next week. Next week would be good."

"event","Her hand and fingers..outstretched in front of her. In front of the mirror. The shiver is undeniable.

Max sits on the chair close to the window,  the two bottle of pills in her hands. One full, the other almost empty. The full bottle is thrown against the wall. ""Not good enough!"" the yelling is liberating. 

Another day. Another search for a decent black market chem lab. Another try.
There must be someone in this city who can reproduce the pills down to the last mg of chemicals."

"event","<small><i>after the Luxuria Halloween party</i></small>

Max threw the leather jacket on the floor, shrugging off her tshirt as soon as she was inside the room, kicking the door shut after herself.

A look around left her unsatisfied. Okay, it was just a room, bathrrom, kitchenette, enough for herself, and the money she had wasn't that much yet, or the rest easily cash-able. Attracting attention was way low on her list of priorities. She could do with something on the walls, though. Posters. Fabric. Something.
Oh, and candles, she had to buy candles. And a full length mirror, too.

Boots thumped on the floor, and Max flopped back on the bed, sprawled as only one can after a full night (and good part of the day after) of debauchery.

""Hi Max, let me introduce you to Cindy, and no, don't you mind the hot, naked, male body, it happens once a month, you know how that is."" Rolling on her front, Max propped her elbows on the pillow, staring at her own reflection in the tiny mirror on the bedside table. ""You've started talking to yourself, Max. Not a good sign. No, my girl, not a good sign.""

Her face was still the same. Years away, in another place, there people thinking about her. Her fingertips touched the reflection of herself in the small cold surface of the mirror. ""You've come a long way, girl. But the old rules still rule. Keep a low profile. Be careful. Don't trust anyone..."" a pause, as her eyes pondered her reflection. ""Same old, same old. You don't want to end up in a lab again, do you? No way, no m'am.""

Rolling over again, fingers laced behind her head, Max stared at the cracked ceiling. <i>There has to be something better, though. I found it once. I'll find it again.....What was that article about the pre-Colombian exhibition? Pre-Colombian statuines sell good..."""

"event","Max is paranoid about security. How could she not be?
Whatever they have achieved in the future, here and now it's different. And as she got here, others might have too.
She keeps a low profile, of course. Lives in an undistinct part of the town where neighbours don't really look at each other much. She hasn't look for a job yet, although couriering still seems the better choice. For the moment, Max has been doing little jobs for herself, stealing here and there, nothing too big, small private collections well insured and not so well protected against thieves with her skills.
The money goes towards rent, food, cloths..and a new bike.
A wonderful, powerful new bike.
Ah, that's what's life is made of."

"event","I'm taking steps to find her. It's weird to be in this city, now, in this time, knowing that in a few years everything will be different. But I can do this, at least. Give her a proper rest. And then get on with my life as best as I can.

Looking for information hasn't changed much. You find a small fish and shake him or her enough so that they'll cough up the name of a bigger fish, and there you go, up the social ladder of thieving, stealing, dealing and what have you. I tracked down one of the biggest fish around here. Go me.


<lj-cut text=""mun notes"">

Okay, vague ideas are coalescing in my mind re: Max. Let's say that for <i>some reason*</i>, she ended up in the past - Dark Angel is set in Seattle,2018, if I am not wrong. She's in NY, a few years earlier, but this NY is not her universe, I suppose, but an AU. So it's not as if she can go to Manticore, gets the kids free and have the labs blown up. There is  a Manticore project here as well, in this AU, but there isn't a Max here. I think it should work decently enough.  But, she knows that there was someone opposing thr Manticore project here, a woman, who was killed for her efforts. Max is starting from there, trying to make things right. 
*I'll think of it eventually :)"

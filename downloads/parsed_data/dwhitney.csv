"event","Can we please stop calling every 4 years ""the most important presidential election of our lifetime"" now? I'm pretty sure I've heard that every election for as long as I've been eligible to vote.  At least this year's is one that we'll all remember.

That said, I still find it amusing that every paragraph I've read that talks about unity and bipartisanship is immediately followed by bitter partisan vitriol.

None of the problems that we as a country face are going to be easy or quick to solve and I worry mostly that expectations are already too lofty and too naive. 

Today merits an extra cup of coffee."

"event","Greetings, dear reader. Grab a mug of your favorite winter beer, make yourself and home, and wax philosophically with me about a topic that we all know and love. I come to you today to speak of the ins and outs of moral equivalence and its affect on all things: life, current events, and this mage game I just joined. Humor me for a moment while I conjecture (or is that rant?) -- it seems the only way I will quiet my raging inner monologue.

I joined a game of Mage the Awakening a couple of weeks ago with a few acquaintances from the last campaign. In it, we are explorers of truth and warriors against the corruption inflicting our society by the sinister hand of the Hierarch. Or at least so we believe.

Our adventures took us under the depths of the Pacific to a small (and entirely fictional) town by the name of Antonio(a?) Bay, north of San Francisco. It was there that we came across beings we would come to know as Deep Ones -- their city guarded with weapon-wielding warriors and a trio of submarines made from coral.

""Give us human sacrifices or take an oath that pledges your fealty and obedience to our kind and our gods,"" we were told. Their gods Dagon and the Hydra. Just so we're clear, I mean these things:
<img src=""http://static.callofcthulhu.com/images/gameinfo/things/deepone_02.jpg"" width=""150"" height=""150"" align=""center"">

And then I was told that these creatures were not ""evil,"" because from their point of view what they do is part of their religion and culture, and to them it's okay. But, and here is the point that I am trying to get across -- I am not them, and I don't care if they think that what they do is okay or not -- that if we say it's okay to sacrifice humans to dark gods in hopes of heralding their return to lord over the world is okay, then we've completely lost any sense of self. It's an argument of moral equivalence -- that is, because from their point of view they aren't evil, we shouldn't judge them. It's nonsense, and yet so popular these days with the church of multiculturalism.

But I can appreciate the art, history, people, cuisine, and spiritualism of another culture without accepting and agreeing with everything they believe. That does not make me ""narrow minded!"" as I was repeatedly accused of, or a bigot; it makes me alive and sane. If you agree that humanity has the right to eat chickens for food, or that prey has the right to fight back and win to survive against predators, then it should not be wrong for anyone to defend their lives or their values in such a manner.

But they're not evil? Of course not - no one considers themselves evil. But that doesn't mean that they're not wrong, or that they should not be killed for the betterment of society. The insane serial murderer is not ""evil"": he's mentally ill. But that doesn't mean that we're better off without him. It's survival of the fittest. All things work to their best interests - countries work toward the interests of their people, and people work to better themselves and things that they care about.

We must not, however, simply say that all beliefs are equally justified and morally okay. It's <I>not</I> okay to stone gays to death in the name of god, to bomb abortion clinics, to beat women, or to execute rape victims for ""not putting up enough of a fight"" (with the only evidence of that being that she got raped). Our society believes at its core that all men are equal, and that everyone is entitled to humane treatment, and to live and let live so long as you allow others to do the same.

But if you simply allow the zealots of the stone age to run rampant because ""they don't believe that they're evil"" does not make you open minded and it does not make you enlightened; it makes you a coward that is afraid to fight for what you believe in because you are afraid that you might get hurt, and it makes you rely on everyone else to keep your utopian ""live and let live"" society free and open on your behalf.

Think about moral equivalence the next time some lunatic blows up a bus full of civilians overseas, and question why the only outrage the world shows is what form the retaliation might take. Are the racists not the very people that take the mentality that ""these little brown savages can't be expected to know right from wrong?"" that claim the moral high ground and self-enlightenment?

And so I conclude with what we all learned as youth: there is such a thing as right and wrong, and if we as a people lose our ability to defend our good values, sometimes by force if necessary, then we are but bodies without an immune system, and lambs to the slaughter of those who have no time for such idealistic tripe."

Keri finally arrived a couple of weeks ago, which means I have even more things to try and find space for - roughly just after finishing the unpacking of all of my own things. The five-square foot kitchen is, unsurprisingly, not big enough. Complicating things further is Overstock, which sent me the wrong parts for this hutch thing I've been trying to assemble.

We went to the Decemberists when they came into town, and they put on a great show; I've been listening to their new CD Picaresque more of less on repeat ever since. It's definitely worth a listen.

When from out on the lawn there came such a roar I slipped from my futon and rolled to the floor. I crawled to the window and pulled back the latch, And muttered, ""Aw, where is that Neighborhood Watch?""

I saw there below through the murk of the night A sleigh and eight reindeer, challenged of height. At the reins of that sleigh sat a mean-hearted knave Who treated each deer like some personal slave.

I'd seen him before in some ads for car loans, Plus fast food, soft drinks and cellular car phones. He must have cashed in from these mercantile chores, Since self-satisfaction just oozed from his pores.

He called each by name, as if 'twere his right To treat them like chattel enhancing his might: ""Now Donner, now Blitzen,"" and other such aliases, Showing his true Euro-centrical biases.

With a snap of his fingers away they all flew, Like Democrats served up brie or tofu. Up to the rooftop they carried the sleigh (The damage to my shingles is there to this day).

Out bounded the man, who went straight to the flue. I knew in an instant just what I should do. After donning my slippers, downstairs did I dash To see this trespasser emerge from the ash.

His clothes were all covered with soot, well of course, From our wood-fueled alternative energy source. Through the grime I distinguished the make of his duds-- He was trimmed all in fur, fairly dripping with blood!

""We're a cruelty-free house!"" I proclaimed with such heat He was startled and tripped on the logs at his feet. He stood back up dazed, but with mirth in his eyes. It was then that I noticed his unhealthy size.

He was almost as wide as when standing erect, A lover of fatty fried foods, I suspect. But that wasn't all to make sane persons choke: In his teeth sat a pipe that was belching out smoke!

I could scarcely believe what had invaded our house-- This carcinogenic and overweight louse Was so red in the face from his energy spent, I expected a coronary right there and then.

Behind him he toted a red velvet bag Full to exploding with sinister swag. He asked, ""Where is your tree?"" with a face somewhat long. I said, ""Out in the yard, which is where it belongs.""

""But where will I put all the presents I've brought?"" I looked at him squarely and said, ""Take the whole lot To some frivolous people who think that they need To succumb to the sickness of commerce and greed,

Whose only joy comes from the act of consuming, Thus sending the value of retail stocks booming."" He blinked and said, ""Ho, ho, ho! But you're kidding."" I gave him a stare that was stern and forbidding.

""Surely children need something with which to have fun? Or it's like childhood's over before it's begun."" He looked in my eyes for some sign of assent, But I strengthened my will and refused to relent.

""They have plenty of fun,"" I cut to the gist, ""And your mindless distractions have never been missed. They take CPR so that they can save lives, And they go door-to-door on used clothing drives.

They recycle, renew, reuse and reveal For saving the planet's a laudable zeal. When they padlock themselves to a fence to protest Against nuclear power, we think they're the best.""

He said, ""But they're children--lo, when do they play?"" I countered, ""Is that why you've come in your sleigh, ""To bring joy to the hearts of each child and tot? All right, open your bag; let's see what you've got.""

He sheepishly did as I'd asked and behold! A Malibu Barbie in a skirt of gold. ""You think that my girls will like playing with this, An icon of sexist, consumerist kitsch?

With its unnat'ral figure and airheaded grin, This trollop makes every girl yearn to be thin, And take up fad diets, bingeing and purging Instead of respecting her own body's urging

To welcome the shape that her body has found And rejoice to be lanky, short, skinny or round."" Deep from his satchel he produced up a toy, Saying, ""This is a hit with most every boy.""

And what did he put in my trembling hand But a gun from the BrainBlaster Power Command! ""It's a 'hit,' to be sure,"" I sneered in his face, ""And a plague and a pox on the whole human race!

How 'bout grenades or some working bazookas To turn all of our kids into half-wit palookas?"" I seized on his bag just to see for myself The filth being spread by this odious elf.

An Easy-Bake Oven--ah, goddess, what perfidy! To hoodwink young girls into household captivity! Plus an archer play set with shafts that fly out, The very thing to put a child's eye out.

And toy metal tractors, steam shovels and cranes For destroying woodlands and scarring the plains, Plus ""games"" like Monop'ly, Pay Day, Tycoon, As if lessons in greed can't start up too soon.

And even more weapons from BrainBlasters Co., Like cannons and nun-chucks and ray guns that glow. That's all I could find in his red velvet sack-- Perverseness and mayhem to set us all back.

""We need none of this,"" I announced in a huff, ""No 'business-as-usual' holiday stuff. ""We sow in our offspring more virtue than this. Your goods are things that they'll never miss.""

The big man's expression was a trifle bereaved As he shouldered his pack and got ready to leave. ""I pity the kids who grow up around here, Who're never permitted to be of good cheer,

Who aren't allowed leisure for leisure's own sake, But must fret every minute--it makes my heart ache!"" ""Enough histrionics! Don't pity our kids If they don't do as Macys or Toys 'R' Us bids.

They live by their principles first and foremost And know what's important,"" to him I did boast. ""Pray, could I meet them?"" ""Oh no, they're not here. By now, they're on the roof, liberating your deer!""

At that Santa sputtered and pointed his finger But, mad as he was, he had no time to linger. He flew up the chimney like smoke from a fire, And up on the roof I heard voices get higher.

I ran outside the co-op to see him react To my children's responsible, kindhearted act. He chased them away, and disheartened, dismayed, He rehitched his reindeer (who'd docilely stayed).

I watched with delight as he scooted off then; He'd be too embarrassed to come back again. But with parting disdain, do you know what he said, This overweight huckster when he took off in his sled?

This reindeer enslaver, this exploiter of elves? ""Happy Christmas to all, but get over yourselves!!""

<snip>

The district said Halloween celebrations and children dressed in Halloween costumes might be offensive to real witches.

""Witches with pointy noses and things like that are not respective symbols of the Wiccan religion and so we want to be respectful of that,"" Hansen said.

The Wiccan, or Pagan, religion is said to be growing in the United States and there are Wiccan groups in Puyallup.

On the district's list of guidelines related to holidays and celebrations is an item that reads: ""Use of derogatory stereotypes is prohibited, such as the traditional image of a witch, which is offensive to members of the Wiccan religion.""

""I do lots of things that are not revolving around wearing a black outfit and stirring a cauldron,"" Wiccan priestess Cheryl Sulyma-Masson said in an interview with ABC News in which she explained that Wiccans, or Pagan Clergy, celebrate nature.

Bear Drank Rainier, But Not Busch

BAKER LAKE, Wash. -- When state Fish and Wildlife agents recently found a black bear passed out on the lawn of Baker Lake Resort, there were some clues scattered nearby -- dozens of empty cans of Rainier Beer.

The bear apparently got into campers' coolers and used his claws and teeth to puncture the cans. And not just any cans.

""He drank the Rainier and wouldn't drink the Busch beer,"" said Lisa Broxson, bookkeeper at the campground and cabins resort east of Mount Baker. 

Fish and Wildlife enforcement Sgt. Bill Heinck said the bear did try one can of Busch, but ignored the rest. The beast then consumed about 36 cans of Rainier.

A wildlife agent tried to chase the bear from the campground but the animal just climbed a tree to sleep it off for another four hours. Agents finally herded the bear away, but it returned the next morning.

Agents then used a large, humane trap to capture it for relocation, baiting the trap with the usual: doughnuts, honey and, in this case, two open cans of Rainier.

That did the trick.

""This is a new one on me,"" Heinck said. ""I've known them to get into cans, but nothing like this. And it definitely had a preference."""

The underestimation stems from, at least in my case, from the author's capable writing ability. His ability to masterfully construct sentences and segway between past and present, while occasionally confusing, adds depth to Sevarian, the book's main character.

I picked up the book at Seattle's own Elliot Bay bookstore after the editors there had it labelled as 'the best science fiction author alive. bar none'; while I found George RR Martin's work more enjoyable (his knack for political intrigue appeals to me), as an author Gene Wolfe is clearly a man among boys.

Hey, I have a crazy idea. Why don't we all practise what we preach for a change? How about we abandon this psuedo-populist class warfare and city-rural babble and respect and tolerate one another? Can't we stop groupinp people for a change? Does the color of your skin or any one of your beliefs make you 'diverse'? 

If power corrupts, then why is the solution to all of the world's problems MORE laws? If 'big business' is the evil of the world, then how is giving more power to the biggest monopoly in the world, the one with the legal authority to KILL YOU, a better solution?

Me busting my ass off to get ahead in life doesn't make me evil. And if you want to make a 'lifestyle choice' of not to contribute to society, then society doesn't owe you anything. Isn't that one of those golden rules? Do what you will as long as you don't hurt another. Just because it's a public resource doesn't make it any less of a burden on the rest of us.

Respect one another. Hatred does not make you sound intelligent even if it's popular. Just because you can parrot what everbody else is saying doesn't make you a 'free thinker.' If you're confident enough with the own choices you've made in life, you might feel more comfortable not trying to clad yourself in the white robes of justice while you ignorantly complain about the ignorance of others.

We're all just people.

Toward the west, a million different paths stretch in an endless maze of questionable directions. Some paths appear rocky, while others coast easily downhill but promise an even greater trek upwards in the not so distant future.

Perhaps this discussion needs to be continued on another blog entry.
Just a thought.
------------------

N) Good point. It is getting hard to keep up.
------------------

As for ACLU not being an atheist organization, well they certainly aren't a Christian organization. The truth of the matter they are affliated with several athiest organizations, which I'm sure a few are mentioned in the list of atheist organizations I provided you with. You know, when you stated atheist weren't organized? ;) 
--------------------
N) I'm sure they're also affiliated with plenty of other organisations other than atheist ones. The ACLU is about civil liberties isn't it? Therefore any organisation concerned with liberty is likely to be affiliated isn't it? It's an interesting question as to whether any religious organisations are affiliated to it. And furthermore, if not why not? Do they then oppose civil liberty? 
-------------------

As for ACLU pushing agendas, they are pushing their own, which oddly enough has an atheistic slant. As for stopping the Religious Right's agenda, what agenda have they pushed, and how does it affect me? This is a ruse if nothing else to detract the conversation. If the ACLU is concerned about free thought and free speech, then my child should be able to learn about how life was created instead of being forced to adopt the erroneous thoughs on evolution. Why push one and not the other? Sounds like they're nixing free speech and thought than promoting it.
--------------------
N) You entirely miss the point. Religion is a dogma. You force it on someone, you are brainwashing them. They also do not have right of reply. Just look at Bacon. You LEARN about evolution. There is nothing to stop you doing your own science to determine the truth or not of it. In fact you are ENCOURAGED to do so, this is good science. Evolution is MEANT to be tested. Religion positively hates it.
--------------------

The point of NAMBLA, which is protected under freedom of speech, curtesey of ACLU & friendly neighborhood atheists is to show you that since you claim that religious dogma supports violence, rape...etc...etc, I in turn am I trying to show you that any belief/non-belief also can support the same violence, in this case against innocent children.
---------------------
N) There are two things here. You continue to try to link the ACLU and atheism. This is false. One is concerned with civil liberties and the other lacks belief in God. That some atheists support ACLU matters not. How many ACLU members would you say were atheist? This means that the others are NOT atheists. Some, shock horror, may even be Christians. This is also the ""boohoo atheists are bastards too"" argument. Even if you are correct, this does not excuse the Christian church. Two wrongs etc etc.

The second thing is that - are atheist organisations raping and killing children? No. Are they condoning it? No. Have Christian organisations condoned the aforementioned? Yes. On several occasions, notably in the middle east, southern France, Spain, the Americas, Africa, Western Europe, I could go on. Not only that, they defend their dogmas through violence."

I'm sure there are many.

Why on earth would anyone want to be affiliated with such idiots Nico?
Wouldn't you want morals?
-----------------

The point here is not that individuals do bad things Mistrmind, the point is that organisations do bad things. In the case of Bacon there are two things that stand out over and above just a bad deed done. The first is that why, when the church was not the authority and law of the land, did it abrogate to itself the right to SILENCE free enquiry and PASS JUDGEMENT ? 

The second thing is WHY does the church (in this particular case Christian but historically not them alone) feel the need to suppress free inquiry by use of force? 

The answer is not hard to find. Free inquiry is the greatest single threat to their existence. This is why religion has always sought a state monopoly and the freedom to persecute and dictate to people how they should live.

There is also a third thing to the story of Bacon. The guy was describing how rainbows worked. Not questioning the divinity of Christ. To react to that extreme is just plain nasty.

And as to atheists having bad apples too, this is true. But there is no ruling body of atheists that judges it OK to rape or murder. Therein lies the difference. YOUR religion has condoned repression, violence, torture and murder in the name of sacred dogma.

And as to your other post on Islam. Not all muslims are bad I agree. But more of them would be nice if they ditched that book of dark age tosh called the Quran, wherein the all-knowing Allah advocates such timeless wisdom as drinking camels piss for what ails you. ;)"

So, I'm trying to find out what you believe exactly. 
First it was Mikkyo Buddhism

You hint at being an Atheist.

---------------
......... yet again for your edification Mistrmind-


M:First it was Mikkyo Buddhism

N: If by first you mean on Amazon, then yes, but if you check back below I've already said this was a LIE. And then about seven or eight times now I have said, quite clearly, that I am not a Buddhist. NOT a Buddhist. A Buddhist I am not. Je n'ai pas un Buddhist. This product is entirely Buddhist free. RDA Buddhism 0%. Move along people, no Buddhists to see here. 

M: Then it was Mikkyo w/o the BUDDHISM (sans emphatic cough)

N: No, ALL I have said is that during the course of pursuing my martial arts that I have found some Mikkyo principles useful, namely, those principles that better enable me figure out what tactics to use against which opponents. Period. This does not make me Mikkyo, this does not make me Buddhist. You can shove the five precepts, dharma, karma, bodhi and bosatsu where the sun don't shine for all I care. Just as if you were to read the NT and decide to treat others as you wish to be treated, you would not be a Christian, without additionally professing some kind of positive belief about JC. Well I don't harbour any belief about Big Cheese Gautama, reincarnation or any of that other stuff OK? Stop putting words in my mouth when I've been clear all along as to what my position on this matter has been.

M: You hint at being an Atheist.

N: Hint? HINT ? Hello? Anyone home? Where have you been since 2001? How could you NOT realise that I'm a dyed-in-the-wool, nail-my-colours-to-the-mast atheist ? Since when I have I EVER expressed ANY morsel of a hint that I might entertain the notion of the existence of God? Heck Mistrmind, your jokes are funny but that's the funniest thing you've come out with yet. Nice one. I'll be giggling all night now.

M: Now you are introducing pitfalls from previous ""debates"". Almost like you assume I'm building some straw man?

N: Nah Mistrmind, I'm just making sure you don't repeat others silly mistakes. I'm lending you a hand, God knows why. The way these debates go they usually end up in a debate on epistemology and once a Christian tries to argue that reason is insufficient and tries to smuggle God in through faith then it's ridiculously easy to KO them. They all commit the fallacy of the stolen concept. But it's easy to recognise once you know what you're looking for. You should thank me for the tip. I've just told you that if you do XYZ then I will do ABC and it will be game over. You now know one of my moves. Forewarned is forearmed, yes?"

Nobody has yet managed to surmount that particular obstacle, which is why postmodern philosophy died in the early 80's, it's just that some people never read the obituaries.

-------------

N: Well, that label does apply to me. Though, as I pointed out, you can't deduce much from it unless we proceed to debate theism, because it's the problems with theism that cause me to be an atheist.
-------------
M: An in-depth examination of what tenets encompass your belief system, whatever it may be.
If you are asking me to defend/debate my beliefs, then you in turn need to debate/defend your beliefs. Don't you find that fair.

----------------
N:What part of ""I am not a Buddhist of any persuasion including Mikkyo"" do you think ""slithers""? It seems perfectly clear to me. Stop grasping at straws.
----------------

N: OK. Tell me, would obeying the commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"" make me a monotheist of some persuasion? 

M: No, for you'd need more data points to make the determination that you are a monotheist from just obeying 1 commandment from the OT. Just like you say you follow/don't follow Mikkyo is a confusing answer to my question, since

1) I don't fully understand what Mikkyo is.
2) You dance around the response that you folllow it, don't follow it, used to follow it a few years ago. Leads to the question, what do you follow now?
----------------
N: I am not a Mikkyo Buddhist, I've never said I follow it, neither now, two years ago or three weeks on Sunday. You agree that following one commandment alone from a religion does not make you a member of that religion. Either you are being deliberately obtuse and stalling so that this discussion doesn't get onto the relative merits of Christianity which I think is the case or perhaps you are genuinely interested in what ""specifically"" I have appropriated from Mikkyo in the hopes that you can criticise it in some way. Well, the elements that I have taken on board from Mikkyo have no supernatural connotations about them and don't require much in the way of belief to put them into action. We can, if you so wish, go into detail about exactly what this is but it would be a pointless and time-consuming exercise in the sublimely irrelevant as I've stated before. 

Discussion of Buddhism is entirely irrelevant since I am not a Buddhist. You can criticise Buddhism to your hearts content, after your research you probably know more about it than I do, I don't much care. I'm not going to defend it. I'm not going to defend Buddha, you can insult him to your hearts content, he is no concern of mine. You can rip Mikkyo to shreds, see if I care. All I care about is the time wasted in doing so, I'd sooner take it as read that OK - you say Mikkyo sucks for XYZ reason - now ask me if I care.

To go back to my oringinal question.

1) What do you believe in. (To say: nothing, is not an answer. You must believe in something.) Come on, Athiests don't believe in God, but ""do"" believe in something.

2) Elaborate on your answer. Stating I'm a Gilbert & Sullivan Miykado Buddhist without the Buddhism doesn't tell me much.
 
--------------------

1. Why must I believe in something? What do atheists believe in as a group? The term atheist simply means without a belief in God, it does not specify that we MUST have a belief in something else. If I choose not to believe in elves must I also be forced to have a replacement belief to take it's stead? I think not. The same applies to a belief in God. I am not obliged to hold a belief merely because I don't believe in God.

2. OK. Tell me, would obeying the commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"" make me a monotheist of some persuasion? Obviously not, many people irrespective of creed don't murder people. Therefore, if I think that something in Mikkyo is an admirable proposition I can choose to incorporate it into my worldview without having to adopt the belief system lock, stock and barrel. I've never said I'm a Mikkyo Buddhist without the Buddhism. I have plainly stated, several times now, that I'm not a Buddhist of any persuasion including Mikkyo.

So, do you practice some form of esoteric Buddhism?
-------------------
No, I practice (or rather practised, I stopped a couple years back) a martial philosophy developed by those who protected Mikkyo shrines. As with any martial arts studies the actual combat comes bundled with the philosophy behind it, which is supposed to aid in the attainment of enlightenment, since Eastern spirituality has a more holistic approach in which mind and body are both supposed to be cultivated. How much of this philosophy is taken on board is down to the individual, a good teacher doesn't force anything down anyone's throats, you can take it or leave it as you wish. This is even moreso in Mikkyo. The guy I mentioned before, when he completed his studies in Japan he asked his teacher ""how do I help others with what I now know?"". His teacher replied ""You don't. This is for you. If they would learn, let them ask"".

...... to be precise I have stated on occasion before to be a Tendai Shingon Mikkyo Buddhist. This is called a ""lie"". There is a reason I did this if you're interested, you're probably not, but I'll tell you anyway. I've often been confronted by Christians who preface their arguments with ""I used to be just like you but then......."". To which I found it amusing to respond ""What? You used to be a Tendai Shingon Mikkyo Buddhist?"". The slack-jawed looks on their faces was worth every penny, as was their reaction to having their belief system kicked into touch by a Buddhist. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of time for Tendai Shingon Mikkyo, as belief systems go it's very, very appealing - the first thing a person has to rid themself of for example, is the silly infantile need for religion. But I'm not an actual Mikkyo. As far as I'm aware there is only one Mikkyo guy in the whole of the UK but he lives a few hundred miles away and I can't be bothered to visit.

So sorry to disappoint you. I wanted to keep it a surprise for later but you kept insisting I go first so you've only yourself to blame really.

Since I called into question your beliefs first, and since you seem to think you're good at defending them, it seems only polite that you should agree to us discussing them first. Then we can discuss what I believe in. 
------------
M:You seem to like to set silly ground rule to protect your thinly constructed attacks/arguments. Perfect example:
------------
""a) assertions have to be backed up by reason or appeal to evidence, otherwise they remain dubious assertions. ""Because it says so in the Bible"" is not an argument any more than ""Because it says so in the Lord of the Rings"". The veracity of the Bible is exactly that which is under question, therefore it is not admissible as evidence.""
-------------
Well, let me explain. If we discuss the Bible we want to establish whether the Bible is correct. But you can't appeal to the Bible to do this. For example, suppose you are suspected of murder, ""I didn't do it"" is insufficient on your part in establishing your innocence. Further example, suppose we were discussing whether astrology is accurate, the testimony of an astrologer that it is accurate is not enough to establish the truth of the matter. One would want, at the very least, a coherent theory of why it might be accurate. Preferably one would want some supporting evidence. And so it goes with the Bible, when discussing whether the Great Flood occurred for example ""it happened because it says so in the Bible"" is neither here nor there in establishing whether it did, in fact, happen. One would want other, stronger evidence. Hobbits do not exist merely because the Lord of the Rings mentioned them. If you fail to grasp what is essentially a basic point of logic, then you're even more stupid than I imagine you to be. I thought you were at least fairly bright.
-------------
M:The Bible in itself ""is"" evidence. I find it unusual you create this rule to our discussion, since previous blog entries you liberally quote passage of the Bible. 
--------------
See above, if you failed to understand what I meant, I trust that confusion is now dispelled. As to the other, I quoted the Bible merely to demonstrate how far you fall short of the standards expected of yourself as a self-professed Christian. This is a valid philosophical move, you claim to believe XYZ yet your actions contradict XYZ. It's called a ""self-negatory clause"", in other words you contradict your own argument. 
--------------
M:I want you to back up your beliefs, BUT, I don't want you to use the articles where these beliefs are defined. It's almost like asking for a debate, and asking your opponent not to use the ""The"" during the debate. 
Your request is odd and disingenuous at the same time.
--------------
I assure you, I'll play by the same rules I expect you to.
--------------
M:If you are serious about having this conversation, then perhaps you need to start answering some questions yourself. It's only then that ideas are exchanged, examined, challenged, rejected or accepted.
--------------
I've already agreed to this, I erroneously assumed you to be capable of basic reading and comprehension.
--------------
M:Your point B of the ground rules is ridiculous at best, since it's a thinly veiled attempt to have me point blank invalidate my own faith in God. Again, silly to have in an argument, since to me it's like saying ""We've proven the sky isn't blue, so from now on you need to admit the sky isn't blue.""
--------------
What's wrong with that? If the sky is shown to be some other colour than blue, then surely any rational person from that point on should admit the sky wasn't blue? What would be the point in continuing to pretend that it was? I'd have thought that was reasonable. Likewise, if you are wrong, I expect you to be man enough and honest enough to admit it. That is not unreasonable. I'm not about to waste my time dismantling your arguments only at the end to have you say ""well, I still believe even though I have no rational grounds to do so"". Not only would it be a waste of my time it would demonstrate massive intellectual bankruptcy, dishonesty and lack of moral fibre on your part. If you can't agree to that simple thing then I win by default since you fail to make good on your claim that you can match me in rational debate. 
---------------

M:As for not knowing, ""What the first bit means..ou."" Gee, do you live under a rock over there is whacky Britian?

Who's the best tuna under the sea?
Come on.
Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?

Chicken Of The Sea!

This today from Mistrmind. Looks like the little bastard has stopped running. Excellent.

Let's lay some ground rules out shall we?

The net of rationality stays up at all times and there shall be no retreat into faith. 

By which I mean, 

a) assertions have to be backed up by reason or appeal to evidence, otherwise they remain dubious assertions. ""Because it says so in the Bible"" is not an argument any more than ""Because it says so in the Lord of the Rings"". The veracity of the Bible is exactly that which is under question, therefore it is not admissible as evidence.

b) once a valid point is made it must be conceded. If the argument is lost it must be conceded, there is no allowance of ""well, I still have my faith"". If you're going to retreat into faith then there really is no point having the debate in the first place. It would be a waste of my time. If your religion is shown to be built on sand then you shall abandon your religion.

I trust these boundaries as a basic framework are agreeable?"

So what kind of whimp are you?
What do you believe in?

Why is that so hard to answer? What are you afraid of?

You slight my masculinity, yet you couldn't muster together the balls of a wet behind the ears teenager to answer the question.
--------------------

........ I'm certainly not afraid of some sad, spotty, cyber-geek who probably spends his hours in darkened rooms wanking away to online smut amidst his collection of teenage comic books, bendy Star Wars action figures and Hustlers stashed under the bed. 

I'm not answering your question not because it's hard and not because I'm afraid; I'm simply not answering your question because it's a blatantly desperate attempt by you to try and save face now that your bluff has been called. 

You think you can win a debate against me. Come on. Prove it. Roll out your arguments and let's go to it. I'm willing.

But the simple fact is you can't. You lie when you think I can't argue rationally and you bloody well know it Mistrmind. You've felt my lash before. Scared to feel it again? What is it? You punishing yourself because you realise you're a bad Christian? I bet this is some kind of therapy for you isn't it? I bet you really loathe yourself deep down for being a deceitful hypocrite don't you? I mean, really, you should be a love-thy-neighbour chap but you know that you aren't, don't you? Go back to the Gospels. Try this from Matthew:

Matt 22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
Matt 22:38 This is the first and great commandment.
Matt 22:39 And the second like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Matt 22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

You're giving us a great show here on how NOT to be a Christian. This is yet another of Jesus' instructions that you blithely ignore. You accuse me of lack of humility but it's really funny that you see fit to ignore the instructions given to you by your Lord and Saviour and flout yourself as a bitchy fuckwit. I mean, how lacking in humility can you be if you decide to overrule God? Tell me, do you happen to think that when Jesus said that he really, deep down in his heart, didn't actually mean it?

Go ahead. Rant and rave all you like, accuse me of cowardice (Imitation: another favourite tactic of Christians, they're so dumb they can't think for themselves) all you please. But we all can see that the one scared shitless of engaging here is the piss-poor excuse for a Christian."

---------------------------
Leaving aside that the more this goes on, the more Mistrmind appears to lose his ability to spell; and passing over that ""w00t"" is so achingly naff it's untrue, yes in addition to all this Mistrmind just doesn't get irony. Ah well, it enhances people's enjoyment of his mental shortcomings and underlines the suspicion that in reality he's a small, petty-minded, spiteful prig that is so comically juxtaposed against his self image.

But that wasn't his only post, oh no, there was this too......

Pip Pip and Cheerio!
Say, I distinctly remember reading something on your profile that you were a practicing Buddhadist?

Is that true?

Care to share with your viewing public what you believe in?

Or do you fear for your glass house?

---------------------------

When in doubt, change the subject. One of my favourite Christian responses. Knowing that he can't defend his belief in a pallid incompetent nailed to a stick being everyone's Lord and Saviour, he would like to try and attack my beliefs and thus divert attention away from the fact that he has no leg to stand on. 

When Buddha was asked about the afterlife he replied ""that is no concern of mine"". That's because Buddhism happens to be a philosophy and not a religion. Buddhism is concerned with the here and now; as the Dalai Lama says the point of Buddhism is happiness. Happiness is not a word that gets bandied about much in the Bible. There's a whole lot of crap that is designed to lend spurious authority to the fact that one semite tribe committed genocide to take another tribes' land. That's in the Bible. And then there's this stupid addendum tacked on about this cheap parlour magician traipsing round pretending to be the king of the tribe for which, unsurprisingly, he was nailed to a stick by sensible Romans. But there is diddly squat about happiness. Page after page of adultery, murder, massacre, pillage and pious sanctimony - and that's from the heroes of the tale!! But sod all concerning happiness that I can tell.

So Mistrmind, I'm not so naive that I'm going to let you divert things into a discussion about Buddhism which would be utterly irrelevant.

The fact is, you make out that you could better me in an argument but then you wuss out like a soft pussy when the gauntlet is thrown down. You claim that your beliefs are true and accurate, you claim that your way is the only way. Tell us why you think why.

"event","..... my day at the office was particularly hectic. I was supposed to do the client reception from 9am this morning and considering I got to work at 8:59 I didn't get off to the best of starts. I suppose I should explain in case somebody who doesn't know what I do actually reads this (And why would you want to? You don't even know me!) but I work for an organisation that gives advice to 13-19 year olds on work, education, housing, family difficulties. And each of us has to do shifts on reception, greeting these kids and making sure they talk to the right people in our organisation. 

Anyway, reception this morning was hectic, not least because we had 16 halfwits who were over 19 years of age and I'm guessing not capable of reading the sign, asking for help. ""Yes sir, the door is that way, glad to be of assistance"". 

But in the course of this morning's reception I came to realise a truism. ""Beautiful girls don't need brains"". We had two rather comely young ladies in this morning both of whom, it has to be said, had the IQ of spinach. The first girl didn't know what she wanted to do as a career. I'm not sure she even knew which day it was or what planet she was on her, admittedly lovely, doe-like eyes were so vacant. But I don't doubt she'll end up in a fine job somewhere, she'll wind up being being interviewed by some guy who'll give her the job just so  he can stare at her all day. 

The second girl, who was scarcely less attractive than the first, handed in a Curriculum Vitae template to be produced by us. She'd managed to attend school and gain utterly no qualifications, not even in RE, even though these days you get your GCSE's free in packets of cornflakes. So she'd managed to put just one piece of punctuation in a paragraph about her previous employment and that a ""."" in the wrong place. So for her referee she'd put in the first line of his address but not the rest of it so you don't even know which city he lived in. What does it matter? She's going far mark my words, brains are strictly unnecessary. At least she had some idea of what she wanted to do though, she wanted to be a hairdresser. Sadly our guidelines meant I couldn't say to her that she shouldn't be let loose near sharp things since she might hurt herself.

(Note, I'm not saying here that beautiful women are stupid. I work with several particularly fine examples that blow that idea out of the water. But being attractive must be hell for them because many would just assume they were stupid).

Today also marked the end of the brief period of efficiency of the local bus company ""FirstBus - We'll Get You There ! Just So Long As It Doesn't Have To Be By A Certain Time!"". Somebody must've noticed a blip in the graph of steadily declining customer service standards and read the riot act to their drivers so normal non-service was resumed this evening meaning that I waited 40 minutes for my bus to show up and got home too late to boot this bugger up and chat to the lovely JPerceval in her lunch hour. So what the hell I phoned, since I got distracted last friday when I said I'd phone back and didn't. And that lifted my whole day. 

I'm almost ready for tomorrow now."

"event","....... they tell us that a guy in a sports car is overcompensating for being not terribly impressive under his own hood so to speak. Well, you see the same kind of thing with people's online handles. Take Mistrmind for instance. If ever a guy picked totally the wrong monicker it's this chap, although to be fair, it's a lot easier to type than ""Mistrspaceinheadlikecoldhardvacuumofspacewhocan'tevenfuckingspellMisterproperly"", so I suppose we must make allowances for him.

Anyway, Mistrmind was (surprise, surprise) somewhat aggrieved over my last journal entry. But then given Mistrmind gets aggrieved very easily indeed, and who indeed can blame him when everyone figures out he's an asshole of the first order and proceeds to make fun of him?, I have to ask myself ""do I care if he's aggrieved?"". And the answer of course is yes, I'm delighted he's aggrieved, in fact the more aggrieved the better because it's always fun to mock the mentally afflicted!

So Mistrmind replied to my journal entry and here it is for us to consider:

I paticularly love this line:

"" And Mistrmind tried to argue his iron age nonsense with me a few years back and got a cyber smack in the chops because I have no truck with these self-deluded, self-important dipsticks and I tell them as much. So there's definitely some bitterness there. ""

I believe it was a certain NicoTaudarian, who had to resort to name calling and idle threats because you couldn't sustain a rational argument?
I believe it was a certain NicoTaudarian who got banned from the discussion?

I love how people just sit back and re-write history to their liking.
Don't you?
--------------------------

We already know from my previous post that there are quite a few things wrong with what Mistrmind believes such as the fact that Jesus didn't want him to believe it because he's not Jewish. So it's no surprise that Mistrminds beliefs in this regard are somewhat errant. 

I seem to recall that Mistrmind never once presented a rational argument worthy of the name for his beliefs and when he was kicked into touch, along with those that preceded him, his place was taken by one of the few Christians who could formulate a rational argument, a nice chap called Lowell. And Lowell and I declared a draw in our debate but only after he'd posted admitting that he had no arguments left standing and could make no headway against mine and my colleague Sean's (and he only got the draw as Sean offered it for making such an honest post, otherwise Sean was all for putting him to the intellectual sword too). Lowell later confided to someone after that he was ""virtually an atheist"". Though he was probably undergoing a crisis of faith at that point in his life ,still - result!

Yes Mistrmind copped for some abuse too but then again, when your brain is closed to rational argument like most Christians' are and you realise that, unlike Lowell, a halfwit doesn't know when he's licked then you call him a halfwit. Or a Jesus fellating splooge gargler. Whatever your imagination is up to, go right ahead, hours of fun for all the family!!! :) Tormenting the self-righteous is a game I never tire of. Since Nero isn't around these days, we can't feed the buggers to lions and frankly, what use are they except as punchbags of a physical or mental sort? The list of contributions to mankind that Christianity has made is stuck on (1) giving us a date from which to start counting.

I'm not sure which discussion I was banned from, maybe Conversation Kills. But I recall a few god-botherers got banned before I managed to, including Mistrminds fellow partner in Receiving Holy Facials - a certain Arsey Borewick, who at last count managed to get herself banned from over half a dozen (ironically Christian) forums which just goes to show what fine and upstanding citizens a diet of Judeo-Christian brainrot will turn out. Oh, and I got my ban lifted in the end but I'd already moved to another forum.

So anyway, so much for Mistrmind. It must still really, really hurt getting his ass handed to him on a plate in a public forum where anyone who cares to can see what an idiot you are. One wonders why he's letting me do it again here. Must be a glutton for punishment."

(see post)

Their reply was: 
Subject: Gee you're funny
Threaten any Christians lately?

Now, I'm wondering why isnt there some kind of sarcasm button you can click when you type something? Because it's hard to tell just in print whether someone is being sarcastic or not"". Because I'm wondering how I should respond to this. 

You see, Mistrmind is one of these God-botherers. You know the ones, they believe that if you're nice to people you're going to go to heaven, hang out with God and do for the rest of eternity whatever God-botherers like doing (which, judging by their actions here on Earth, is being constantly annoying, badgering people, casting judgements on people even though it says in their holy book not to do that very thing, generally trying to make everyone's life a misery because they're not getting any sex, that kind of thing). 

So you see, if Mistrmind is being sarcastic then, as you can see, he's not being terribly nice. Which makes him your average hypocritical Christian.  On the other hand Mistrmind could be genuinely paying me a compliment with his ""Gee you're funny"".

I'd like to think the latter is the case but a couple of things occur to me. The second line for instance ""Threaten any Christians lately?"". Now this just has animosity written all over it. Also ""Gee"" in the first line, though I acknowledge gee can be ambiguous, for instance an American once said to me ""Gee I love your accent"". But generally gee at the beginning of a sentence indicates that what follows next is meant to be taken at the opposite value.

There's also an undercurrent of resentment in that second line as Mistrmind and I have a history. This is because he's one of those God-botherers who comes online so they can actually try to get people to believe their outrageous bollocks and get off on feeling superior to people without running the risk of a well-deserved smack in the chops. And Mistrmind tried to argue his iron age nonsense with me a few years back and got a cyber smack in the chops because I have no truck with these self-deluded, self-important dipsticks and I tell them as much. So there's definitely some bitterness there. 

But what's another chip on the overloaded shoulder of a Christian anyway? We all have our crosses to bear and theirs is being compelled to still try spreading thoroughly discredited myth in the face of a much more sceptical audience than that which they faced millenia ago.

Personally I suggest they go back and study the New Testament. In the first 50 pages of Matthew alone there are two instances of Jesus instructing his followers that their mission is not to Gentiles they must preach to the lost sheep of the tribes of Israel and a further instance of him telling them that they will sit and judge the 12 tribes of Israel in the afterlife. Well maybe if you're Jewish someone should talk to you about Jesus Christ, but last time I checked I'm certainly not Jewish, Mistrmind isn't Jewish and 100% of Christians I've ever met aren't Jewish either. Which means Jesus is fuck all to do with me, fuck all to do with Mistrmind and fuck all to do with Christians. But Christians, whilst they profess belief in Jesus, never actually obey a damn thing he says. 

So, nice to hear from you again Mistrmind. Good to see that you still feel threatened by my presence on your ""turf"". Guess your ass still smarts from last time huh? Cheers."

I love my friends. Well, everybody who was at Britty and Kels's. I love them so much. They're so awesome. Except for Cody, 'cause, well, there's no need to explain that.  J/k. lol 

I love Bruce. I do. I miss talkin' to him. But, at least we're hanging out more? (BTW, WE REALLY NEED TO HANG OUT MORE THAN ONCE EVERY 6 MONTHS. LOL) I want Bruce to be happy. But, I'm sure he wants the same. 

Jesse and I are like an old married couple. Everything is predictable. The excitement of learning about that person is gone. lol But, I'm kind of happy about that at the same time. Ah, well. 

I can't wait for college.

I can't wait to get a job. 

I wish I had more time to do stuff.

I CAN'T WAIT 'TILL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!! (Girls' night with some of the youth girls from CHFG and Britty, Kels, Bruce, Cody, Celeste, Trevor, Kyle, Jess, and me having a Christmas partaay (lol) at Jesse's house.)

I can't wait until the summer so I can find out what happens with Jimmy and Emily... lol 

I love Max Lucado (author)

Jennifer's birthday is this coming Sunday! 

I need to go shopping.

I love you guys. :D"

Ever since Jess and I have been going out I've basically ditched you guys. And... well frankly, I hate it. I miss the way that we were always there for each other and could talk about anything anytime. But now I hardly ever get to see you guys anymore... so if y'all are going to do something, please tell me. lol I'll try as hard as I can to be there. I really miss you guys."

I need new friends! I love love love love love my old friends. I always will love them. I need new friends that AREN'T in band. lol And I hate my first hour because everybody is either snobby or just mean. lol but that's how it is. Junior year is already a lot more stressful than sophomore year. I can't wait to get out of high school. It just sucks. 

Blaine is a really cool guy. So is Joe. 

I can't wait until the end of September. For one, Jesse and I will have our one year anniversary on the 27th. And things will hopefully be less stressful.

Must go write a newspaper story and do my geometry.

Wow. The Westmoore game was fun like wow. I had a shirt, hoodie, and Casey's racing jacket on, and gloves, and I was STILL freezing my butt off. The game was so fun though. Hung out with (some of the people are..) Casey, Brit, Kels, Christie, Bruce, Zack, Robert, Tyler, Kat, Misty, Xstasia, and Fred. It was oh so fun. Yeah, Bruce all called Jesse, but all Jesse heard was 'You need to beat up Casey'. So, meh. But then I told him... kind of. 

So yeah, I'm kinda confused about that whole thing. I don't know what to do. Nat asked Casey if he liked me. She goes 'Do you like Jessica?' and Casey goes 'Why do you ask?' and she goes 'Cuz it looks like you do..' and he goes 'Shut up!!' and smiles. Well, that's what Natalie said. So, I duno.

Anyways.. I can't wait 'till October 29th. NEXT FOOTBALL GAME!!!... that I can go to. lol

All that happened yesterday was Kacey P. and I stuck M&M's up our nose & let 'em melt so that chocolate runs down your face. It's great fun when you're really bored. Then, I fell asleep and missed church. v_v 

Today- 1st- watched and finished Merlin and I have a lot of work to do in there tomorrow. Yay... >_>

2nd- Played kickball and we lost. We lost BAD. 

3rd- we walk into class and Loveless goes 'We're going to the play. Let's go.' So we walked over to the PAC and watched Hansel und Gretel. Joe's friggin awesome. lol

4th- Took notes, did a worksheet, and sat there listening to annoying people who sit around me.

Lunch- Stood outside with Tyler, Fred, Kat, and Jared mostly. Then Bruce, Misty, Honor, and Casey. Then we all went inside and talked 'n' stuff. Now Casey talks to me all the time. Why, I don't know. I haven't talked to him in several weeks. But anyways, yeah.

After school- went to Monroney with Sam, Kat, and David. Monroney is SO friggin' small now it's crazy. Then we dropped off Sam, and then went on Base to drop off Kat, then I got home.

Now, I have to clean 'n' stuff and do homework. Jesse is probably going to come over here before the game and then we're goin to the MWC game. Yay! Can't wait.

Then we got up, went outside, Ryan, Timmy, and Kenny came over for a bit, they left, and then the girlies left. v_v Then I got online and talked to Jesse. I felt kinda bad whenever Jesse and I were together, cuz I felt like I was leavin' out Brit, Kels, and David. v_v I'm SO sorry 'bout that y'all!!! I felt really bad. I hope y'all understand.

Nothing's really happened this week except for yesterday, so I'll talk about yesterday.

Friday- went to school, sat around and talked in 1st hour, ate and talked in 2nd, watched annoying German videos in 3rd, took a quiz and talked to Kaleda and Megan in 4th. Then we went to the assembly at 11:00. (I <3 getting out of classes at 11:00.) I sat next to Ibby, Cynthia, Chelsey, Deana, and some other people. It was pretty boring. Then we went to the band room afterwards and me, Bruce, David, and Ibby all went to McDonald's. (Thank you David for getting your license!) Sat with Lloyd, Bruce, David, and Ibby. Sat next to Tommy on one side and Allison, D'Avia, and Chelsey on the other. Quite fun really. David had several chances to run over Sam Wilson, but NO! LoL j/p. But yeah, David's crazy. He pulled up right next to the band room blastin' pow-wow music. So o'course, I jump out of the car. LoL Then Bruce picked me up, handed me to David, and then David handed me to Jonte holding me with his one-armed self. Gosh the guy is strong. LoL so then all of my band friends went and marched and such. Whenever they went to go get lined-up, I hung out with Jonte and his friend. Jonte's the best. LoL so we went to the Ad Building 'n' watched the parade from there. It was me, Sarah, Charlie (I can't stand him), Jonte, Lenny, Chuckhouse, Josh D, and Joel. It was fun. LoL then we walked back to the band room and walked with Jonte, Laura, Frank, and Robert. Then I took some of Jonte's Mountain Dew, gave him a hug, and David took me and Ibby home. Then I got ready for the game, went over to Brit and Kels's, and went to the game. Ethan's little friends are annoying at the games. I'm not too fond of them. Everybody thought I was mad or something during the game, but I was fine. Just tired. Anyways, saw all my band people (they're the best) LoL, talked to all of 'em, and yeah. I only had fun during halftime and 3rd quarter. Tyler is the best!!! LoL And, yeah. Then Brit and Kels left early, so I got a ride from Kat. We picked up Michael, went by the high school, saw all the football players o_- , and then went home and got online. 

That was my day. Fun fun fun... :-/ but anywho, I'm gonna go find somethin' to do.

But anyways... I can't really remember stuff that's happened. But on Friday, went over to Christie's and all that good stuff, and then walked to the game. Saw Tommy. Said hi to him. I felt like being nice that day. And.. I saw Christy!! YaY! While we were on the Moore side, some random guy (really ugly with pizza grease on his face, SICK!) stopped me and started talkin to the guy next to him about my shirt (I was wearing my beat Del City shirt). It kinda freaked me out, so I just walked off, needlessly stating that I stayed on the MWC side the rest of the game. And... yeah. Josh D kept flirting with me the whole time. v_v Saw all my friends there! That was GREAT!!! Talked to Casey a lot. v_v I don't think I'm over him... v_v Kat said that whenever Josh started flirting with me that casey would get jealous and stuff.... ::snaps out of daze:: Anyways, I just didn't feel like stayin' the night over there, so I just got a ride with Kels and Ethan. And that was just half of Friday.

Saturday- got up and around, went to Frank's with Sarah at 2. Frank and his friend Devon were high whenever we got there. That wasn't too good. Needless to say, we got NOTHING done. And we spent 5 hours over there. That was the sad part. So now I'm stuck writing the script myself today. So that's what I'm gonna be doing today. Yay.... >_<  Anyways, tomorrow should be interesting. I'm gonna have to make a few changes to some stuff..."

  I'm really bored right now. About to go do my To Kill A Mockingbird stuff that's due tomorrow. O_O I hope I pass it.. anyways. I wanna go to school tomorrow. Because it's so boring here.
   
  And I think I'm just gonna give up on this Casey thing. It's just kinda hopeless, so.. yeah. It's a lot easier not liking anybody. Espically in high school. So, yeah. That's about it. Guess I'm gonna go do my work now. v_v

This weekend, sucked. Nothing happened at all really. 

Today. Got 30 minutes of sleep last night. So that really sucked. Had a crappy day cuz that's what I felt like. Didn't dress out in 2nd hour, but then again, neither did half the class. Then at lunch, went out to the band room as usual. Then went in the commons with Kat, and then I sat with D'Avia, Alison, Deana, and Caycee. And I swear, everybody asked me if Caycee and I were goin' out. And then I had an okay day in 3rd and 4th. But after school, I went out to the band room with Honor, and talked to Caycee for 30 minutes. We were the last people there. It was kinda sad. But anyways, we talked and all that good stuff and people once again kept askin' if we were goin' out. But... anyways, I can't wait 'till tomorrow. It's gonna be a much better day cuz I said so. ^_^ I'M THE COOLEST CUPCAKE IN THE BAKERY!!! Yeah! That's right!

'Cause tomorrow's another day, and I'm thirsty anyway, so bring on the rain."

Ethan and them think that I was flirting with him, but I wasn't. It's someone called CAYCEE!! Cuz, I <3 Caycee oh so much. I miss him already! Ok, I'm done. Ignore that. o_- But anywho, then I just hung out with all of my people. Cuz uh, we rawk like that. Yeahuh! Bruce and Christie looked oh so cute together! ^_^ And Kat took a pic of me and she said she's gonna give it to Caycee. I looked *oh so pimp* in Danny's hat. Not really, but I like to pretend. 

Now onto today at SCHOOL. 1st hour- took a quiz and talked to Kayla and Angee. 2nd- did our usual excercises and such and then sat in the locker room the whole hour with Casey Price, Tazia, Alison, and Donetta. Then, NO BOMBER PRIDE! So Kit and I walked to my grandma's house and she took us to McDonald's. Then we went and at it at the band room. I was actually FULL AT SCHOOL. LoL But then we went to the commons and Jontae stole my shoes! But then Kit got 'em back for me. Then 3rd hour, did a dialoge with Nathan Davis (he's actually pretty cool) then watched 2 movies. Then 4th hour, ''studied'' for a quiz, aka, talked to Jontae the whole time. Then took a quiz. Then talked with Jontae the rest of the hour. Then we went to the assembly where I sat with D'Avia and Deana. The band was pretty good. And then sat through the boring thing. Then afterwards, went to the band room to wait for Josh, and talked to Caycee the whole time. I miss him already. WoW, I've fallen for him like wow. Ok, so that was my day. How was yours?! ^_^"

Yeah, I just heard that song. I <333 it. Anyways, uhm.. Katrina said that Caycee said that he likes me too, so das ist wunderbar. He hasn't asked me out or what not though. Anyways,uhm... nothing's really happened lately. Talked to Loren for the first time in like, a jaillion years. 
Prayer requests- For Caycee, that I can help him find God. And to put a burden in his heart. And for Kelsey, that everything will get better for her. And don't forget to thank God for everything he's done for us. God is awesome. There's no words to describe it."

You say ya'll ... many times a day.

Bedlam is a BIG deal.

You can tell when it's tornado weather.

When you drive through a neighborhood anyone out walking will smile and wave at you.

You've worn flip flops in the winter

You have stopped to let a family of deer cross the road.

You thought the twister ride at Universal Studios wasn't windy enough.

You know who your neighbors are, how many children they have, and when one of them gets 
married or graduates.

There are at least 2 to 3 Sonics, McDonalds, and Little Ceasars in your town

You've been off roading - many times

You or someone you know was born, raised and still lives in the same town.

You know that Miami, Oklahoma and Miami, Florida are pronounced two different ways.

You plan events around football games.

You are a Cowboy or Sooners fan.

You learned how to do country and western dances at school.

A tornado warning siren is your signal to go out in the yard and look for a funnel.

You can properly pronounce Eufaula, Gotebo, Okemah and Chickasha.

You can remember the name of the last state legislator to introduce a bill involving castration, 
and he didn't mean farm animals.

You know exactly what calf fries are, and eat them anyway.

You think that people who complain about the wind in other states are sissies.

It doesn't bother you to use an airport named for a man who died in an airplane crash.

You have owned at least one belt buckle bigger than your fist.

A bad traffic jam involves two cars staring each other down at a four-way stop, each determined 
to be the most polite and let the other go first.

It doesn't seem odd to see the term ""chicken fried chicken"" on a menu.

You save all your life for your dream vacation, and use it to go to the OU/Texas game.

It doesn't seem peculiar if your sweetie says ""I'm going in to town for something"" even though you 
live in town.

You don't turn on the news until 20 minutes past the hour, because that's the only thing you care 
about anyway.

Your quarterback is hurt and it is the top story on the six o'clock news.

You keep track of the grain and hog futures on the radio.

You don't buy all your vegetables at the grocery store.

You go to the State Fair for your only vacation.

You get up at 5:30 A.M. and go to the coffee shop, where the waitress never asks what you 
would like. She already knows.

You are on a first name basis with the county sheriff.

You know what the ""Sea of Red and White"" is.

You think that using the elevator involves a corn truck.

You can drive 80 mph on a two-lane dirt road with one hand, but driving 45 mph on a four-lane 
expressway in a city scares you to death.

You use manure on your grass instead of Weed and Feed.

Your nearest neighbor is in the next zip code.

You know the difference between fee corn and sweet corn... while it's still on the stalk.

You wear cowboy boots to church.

You know that everything goes better with Ranch.

You learned how to shoot a gun before you learned how to multiply.

""You wanna Coke?""
""Yeah.""
""What kind?""
""Dr. Pepper.""

You know what ""Orange Power"" and ""Crimson & Cream"" means.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Oklahoma.

"event","WoW, today at church really meant a lot to me. It made me realize some stuff. 
1) Lately, I've been trying to please people and not God. And that he hasn't been what I've been focusing on. And I really need to start doing that.
2) I need to read the Bible more. I talk online and do this lj stuff more than I read my Bible and concentrate on God. So I'm gonna start doing that.
3) I need that to start spreading God's word to people at school. I'm going to find at least one person to try to bring closer to God. 

So please pray for me to help me through this year and to stay close to God and help me to keep him as my #1 always. Thank ya!

I can't turn back time. If I could, I would. But I can't. So I guess that's kinda not gonna work. But I ono. I had to go and I haven't talked to him since. And our electricity was off for 5 hours yesterday. I was so bored. I made s'mores with candles. Again. Then I called a lot of people. Bruce mostly. He thought I was drunk. But I was just bored. Josh called me. He kept goin on and on about his friend who couldn't find his house. *Josh's, not his own*. And... finally our electricity came back on at 11:15. So I leapt off the couch and went straight for the computer. The computer's my drug. I'm addicted to it. I've become dependent on electricity. ^_^ I'd kill myself if suddenly tomorrow I became Amish. LoL. Hmm... so... I ono. That's all."

"event","<lj-cut>Trans-Am, t-top's down. 
Red-light in my home town. 
Nothin' to do, just cruisin' around, 
With a couple of my best friends. 
So he pulls up in this blue Mustang. 
Finest thing we'd ever seen. 
All cowboy'd up in his hat 'n jeans. 
Only one thing to do when he pulled away. 

We went flyin' down the interstate, 
Chasin' those Texas plates. 
Seventeen, we couldn't wait, 
To see where the road might lead. 
Not a care in the whole wide world, 
Just three Oklahoma girls, 
Wantin' a piece of the Lone Star state, 
Chasin' those Texas plates. 

Blue letters read Cowboy fan 
Texas flag on top of them. 
He looked like the kinda man, 
You can't take home to Mama. 
He went slow for a couple of miles, 
Flashin' lights an' tradin' smiles. 
Then he stepped on the gas an' he waved goodbye, 
An' we couldn't catch up but we had to try. 

We went flyin' down the interstate, 
Chasin' those Texas plates. 
Seventeen, we couldn't wait, 
To see where the road might lead. 
Not a care in the whole wide world, 
Just three Oklahoma girls, 
Wantin' a piece of the Lone Star state, 
Chasin' those Texas plates. 

Oh yeah. 
We were flyin'. 

An' I still love to remember, 
That Trans-Am and that summer. 
And just how good it felt..... 

When we went flyin' down the interstate, 
Chasin' those Texas plates. 
Seventeen, couldn't wait, 
To see where the road might lead. 
Not a care in the whole wide world, 
Just three Oklahoma girls, 
Wantin' a piece of the Lone Star state, 
Chasin' those Texas plates. 

Oh yeah, chasin' those Texas plates.

O yeah! That's SO gonna be us whenever I get my license. Yeahuh! But I duno who's gonna come with. I ono, somebody! o_-"

That made me so mad. >_< But anyways, then I went to Quizno's, then library and I saw Oral B. Then came home and stayed around the house for a while. Then went with my mom to get some plants for the teachers at her school. Then came back home, and Josh called. So I went over there and we went to pick up Ethan to go play basketball with us. So we picked him up and went and played ball. But we didn't play. They had a bang of people there. Matt was there. v_v BTW, he said that that girl thing is done. Like over. So... that was kinda good news, but then again it wasn't cuz... yeah. Anyways, then Josh took us home and we walked to Whataburger. I didn't know we were supposed to wait for Ethan, so he got mad. Then we walked to Cleveland Bailey. Then Ethan met us there. Then we walked home and sat outside. It was quite fun actually. LoL. Well, I'm going now. Byeee."

We were meant to be, suppose to be, but we lost it

All this time you were pretending 
So much for my happy ending 

It's nice to know that you were there, 
Thanks for acting like you cared 
and making me feel like I was the only one. 
It's nice to know we had it all, 
Thanks for watching as I fall 
and letting me know we were done.

"event","I haven't updated here in forever, but I have been following the new Who episodes.  I haven't reacted to most of them, because I wanted to see where things were going, and to do so without being influenced by fandom.  Just, you know, watching the thing.  Well, end of the season.

Also, tidbit of the same for Torchwood - spoilers and reaction, at the end.
<lj-cut text=""Reaction post : Spoilers"">

The good: 
Love Amy and Rory. 
Love that there's more than one companion.  
Love <i>Eleven</i>.
Love 'Sexy'. 
Love the confusion and 'what's going on' and that the arc worked all season.

The bad:
Oh look! He's not the last of the time lords!  Amy magically gave birth to one!  All that angst for the previous seasons?  Never-mind, didn't mean it. 

River is the biggest Mary Sue I have ever, ever, seen.  Love her base personality to bits, thanks to awesome RPers out there, but really? Way over the top.

The Doctor proposed to River.  
Technically? Good outweighs the bad.  By far. 

In practice?  I couldn't stand Doctor/Rose.  I couldn't stand the 'It's another Doctor! Who ran off and lived happily ever after in another universe with Rose'.  I couldn't stand the 'Everyone's in love with the Doctor' thing through Tennant's run.  I? Can't fucking stand this either.  And at this point?  I think it's fairly safe to assume I will have fond memories of Who, probably keep abreast of what is happening from friends, and be very sad that trying to watch it makes my blood pressure shoot up and that vein in my temple throb - because dammit, I just fell in love with Eleven. 

Torchwood? Similar deal:  What the shit <i>was</i> that, fond memories, great love of Jack, and no desire to know what the writers are going to do with characters (well, a character) I love, next go around. 

Yes, my basic: Please enjoy what you want, don't piss on others; parades, the writers can do what they want with their character attitude still applies, but so does my belief that I can like what I want and uh. 

I don't like.  It may settle in my brain in another year or two, but right now?  blergh.,"

I realize House (the show) isn't exactly knowing for realism, and that House (the character) is known for engaging in random, impulsive, and self-destructive acts, but-

Seriously, what the fuck was that? 

Besides an act of random drama and/or a psychotic break. 

I feel like I've got whiplash, or something.  'Regular episode, random CAR THROUGH CUDDY'S HOUSE, HOUSE ON A BEACH'. 

I'm so taking my muse and going home. 

I don't even care that I'm not being fair. I just don't.

Mostly it's just playing characters we love, miss, and who haven't seen a lot of action/popularity in a while.   I'm not advertising until Friday, because I want a chance to get the word out to friends first, for the purpose of char claiming. 

So, you know, that's that."

"event","There is a game I want to play in. It's a multi-crime drama-fandom game. Well, crime drama, medical drama. It could have canon and OC spies and FBI and cops and CSIs and Doctors and Lawyers and Firemen and Tech Geeks and maybe even some 'works at the coffee shop' characters. Basically anyone who could justify being tied into those types of plot.

This game does not exist - yet.  This game is going to exist, just as soon as I can block out enough time to make it happen.   Because my previous post that speculated only about four people would be interested (because of my normal rp peeps love of Sci-fi/fantasy) has been proven wrong.  I also realized I can role-play with other people, and LJ is full of other gamers.

So, you know, watch this space."

<lj-cut text=""Reaction post for tonight's Criminal Minds ep: SPOILER WARNINGS"">

I.  What? 

I am going to refrain from bitching about the whole Emily-arc (because I am cranky and will regret it later and I try to be fair and that wouldn't be), but: 

What the fuck was with the cop-out at the end?  If you're going to kill off the character, and are reasonably certain you're not bringing them back - <i>kill the damn character off</i>.   I hate that shit.  That last two minute scene with her going off with a new identity, into the French night, completely removes all of the impact from... the entire rest of the arc, actually.  Okay, the entire rest of the arc in general, but particularly, you know, the emotional reactions of the other characters. 

Let me reiterate: I didn't want Emily dead or gone from the show, but FFS, if they were going to whisk her away into a new identity, what the hell have the past episodes been about?  They could have covered this in a two parter and been done with it.  

I lied: I am going to bitch about something else. 

Since when has Hotch <i>ever</i> been unable to use his gun to kill a suspect who needs killin?  He <i>beat Foyet to death</i>.  Seriously?  He can't promise to kill a serial killer and terrorist?  WTF.

I feel like the suckiest fan ever, but: 

<i>I just don't care</i>.  I'm trying really, really hard, but much as I like Emily (or did) and her past makes sense for her (it does), I just can not for the life of me get invested in this story arc.  Most of the major players are complete unknowns to me/the show and at this point it's just dragging for me.

I miss profiling/case of the week- and seeing more than 2 minutes of all the characters that aren't her/there to die. 

I feel <i>bad</i> for saying this, because I'm such a staunch defender of the show being what the show is, and I'm still a firm believer in that.  I'm sure there are people who are enjoying the heck out of this, but.  I'm... bored."

"event","I have been watching Criminal Minds, but haven't had a whole lot to say.  Also, I'm busy, lazy, and having fun with RP.  Anyway:

<lj-cut text=""Spoilers for last several episodes - mostly last night's"">

Long and short:
I want to care what's going on with Emily but for some reason I just don't.  I don't know if it's because she's not My Character or because the plot-line looks/feels poorly integrated into the storyline.  It's just a little over the top, seems to be coming out of nowhere, and doesn't hit quite the right note to get me emotionally involved. This isn't 'omg how dare they' type stuff, just 'eh', and being more interested in what's happening with her cat. 

Hotch driving in a car chase? Makes me happier than anything that simple reasonably should.  Scenes of him with Jack continue to make me unreasonably warm and fuzzy.

Last night's ep actually kind of... bothered me.  Let me say from the get-go: I am not white-knighting (or neurotypical knighting, whatever).  I'm not saying that their handling was any worse than Criminal Minds has been at handling any other issue - and my belief that given the format and setting Criminal Minds has done a pretty damn good job at handling Stuff.   

I am saying that as the mom of a 10 year old autistic son? Watching that was fucking painful in all kinds of ways, both the things they got right and the subtle things they got wrong. That was enough to sufficiently distract me from being able to <i>really</i> watch the show for what it was, however:

I loved Reid and Rossi in this one.  I loved Reid with the kid and love that Reid went out and bought a keyboard when they got home.  Yeah, I know it's one more skill for him and one more way that's going to make him special, but it fits him.  Especially given his remark about it being basically math.  And again: I love his interaction with the kid. 

I love Rossi's interaction with the aunt and especially loved the 'father's realizing their son isn't going to have it quite as easy as he did' remark and sadly found myself eyeballing him and wondering, in a nonslash goggles way, when he came out to his dad and exactly how badly that had blown up in his face.  As he has no kids that was where my mind jumped first. Second it jumped to 'wow, he's gotten really close to Hotch and Jack'.  I'm sure the writers are going somewhere else, but whatever: Where my brain went made me happy. 

I am not watching Suspect Behaviour.  I'm old with a 10 year old autistic kid and involved in animal rescue.  We get up early and I'm OUT before 11 p.m most nights and just not that interested yet."

"event","I read a fic last night that had Serial Killer!Hotch, in prison and being interviewed by Prentiss.  It's really, really, interesting and one of those stories I wish I had written. Not so much because I loved every twist and turn the story took (I didn't, to be honest), but because the basic idea was so damn awesome and believable. 

It's interesting, because there are a lot of scary!Reid fics out there (or at least one, really long one) but that one kind of failed with me.  I think because the canon tie-in for <i>Reid</i> wasn't there.  I like AU (sometimes, though I can't write it) but the closer to canon you can be when you jump, the happier I am.  This one worked because Hotch was Hotch.   He was just a Hotch who snapped and used profiling to find killers before they started killing, and... eliminated them. 

Given Hotch's career moves thus far - starting with prosecuting criminals after they were caught, to SWAT where he was involved in the catching, to BAU where he was trying to get ahead of the next victim - I can easily believe that with a good stressor, he'd go there.   The story had a great one, and the story went there, and it made me <i>happy</i>.

Conversely, I also fell a little in love with <lj user=""bluerosefairy"">'s Mirror!Verse, and all I got as a description of that was 'B.A.U is a group of pet psychos used to catch other psychos, and Hotch is a sociopath', so clearly there's something with my mood right now that makes me want to turn everyone evil, arm them and set them loose on the world. 

Um. Real update soon. I have more Hotch meta.  I just lack the ability to pull all my thoughts (family, social conditioning, his age, where he was raised etc.) organized enough to be comprehensible.  If I can get it done before Puppy-Invasion, I'll call it a win.

Criminal Minds: Spencer Reid?  Responds to emotional distress or physical danger either by talking very, very fast or by getting angry.   Hotch cries more often and more freely: which isn't saying much, I don't believe we've ever seen Reid cry.

Torchwood:  Ianto hides an alien in the hub, calls Jack a monster and promises to make him suffer. 

Those two examples are off the top of my head/from my most recent fandoms,  but I am absolutely certain they exist in absolutely every fandom, ever.  I also believe trend for some character designated as a bucket of snot and tears needs to die before my head caves in. 

Where does that <i>come from</i>?"

"event","I just spent a good hour watching Doctor Who and Torchwood vids, and getting all weepy and nostalgic. 

I've only been a casual viewer of Doctor Who for the past year or so,  and I am completely disinterested in the upcoming Torchwood season, but. 

I loved right up until the point canon went somewhere I wasn't able to follow and continue to care about them anymore, at which point I buggered off and spent some time twiddling my thumbs on the way to finding something new to love.  The love I have for the stuff up to that point hasn't gone anywhere, though.

I'm not bitter; this isn't a rant.  Eventually, in any long running canon they eventually throw a curve ball I can't handle, or I just get bored.  I'm just.  Suddenly really, really, missing early!Jack and Nine like burning.  

They were both so ...intensely who and what they were, together and individually, and nothing in the canon before or since has touched that for me. They were beautiful and brave and strong and broken and fucked up and unapologetic and <i>wonderful</i>.

I think I might even got poke and play a bit with younger!Jack somewhere.  Or just re-read my old fics and drink cocoa and be self-indulgent enough to allow myself to miss, and be sniffly over, missing some fake-people."

It's not really that I minded the whole day of downtime when they were doing maintain-y thing. I didn't even mind, really, well another cropped up and it took another whole day to fix.  It was disorienting for me, sure, but I lived with it because I was able to move some role-play into email and g-docs and life carried on with me having tags in the background to answer and be happy about. 

Waking up to it down and having things I want to answer and no way to do so? Irritating. Especially since IJ hasn't updated and told anyone wtf is going on with the site. I swear, it's never been the most reliable thing in the world, but this is just getting ridiculous.  And making me cranky.

...Going to go find my shippping meme to answer and try to occupy my brain before it explodes from characters who have Things To Say and nowhere to say it."

This song reminds me so much of Criminal Minds

'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear

And

My God, amazing that we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Driving shiny big black cars
And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve

"event","Hotch/Reid is my first 'most popular pairing' ever, I think.  Usually, I'm at least one step off the boat all the bat-shippers pile onto.  I liked Kirk/Spock, but I liked McCoy/Spock more, and McCoy/Sarek was my favorite.  I hated Nine/Rose and Jack/Ianto, but I was all over Jack/Nine (but not Jack/Ten).  I liked House/Wilson okayish, but I'd much rather read House/Chase.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for length: talk of shipping, my shipping, and Hotch/Reid"">
Looking at that list, I can see very well what fandom's going to approve as their OTP, and I can see why: They're looking for something that has either a-) an innocent, sweet party that can be cast as the 'girl' (even when there is no girl), and/or b-) one that has a chance in hell of a happily-ever-after ending.  

Folks, I have been happily married for 13 years,  have a couple of kids, and a big old farm house, sitting on a hill.  If I wanted to write about the trials and tribulations of a traditional family, I'd be writing a biography. I certainly wouldn't be writing about aliens, mutants, immortals, or FBI agents. 

That's not to say I think everyone has that experience, or everyone writes for the same reasons I do, or that they should - I hasten to add.  I know danged well the reasons people write are as diverse as their life experiences and lifestyles.  I'm telling <I>no one</i> what to write, why to write, or how to write.   It's just not for me. 

So I latch onto a single character and then, apparently subconsciously, pick the most fucked up, dysfunctional relationship I can see as that still has potential to happen, and go with that.  Usually this keeps me with, as I said, in at least one boat over from the most-popular ship.  There's usually a character in common, but not both. 

Criminal Minds though, is breaking my brain. My 'most fucked up relationship possible' is apparently everyone else's 'has potential for happily-ever-after'. 

What I see is basically a mess, and a list of issues so long that I'm afraid to start listing them because they'll take over the entire post: work, relative positions of authorities, communication skills, dead wives, rape, drugs, schizophrenic mothers, hero complexes, impulsiveness, control, PTSD- I could go on, and on, and on, and I probably would still touch on everything there that makes Hotch/Reid Not!Fluffy. 

What fandom sees is a pretty younger guy, a handsome older one, and the potential for happily ever after with a ready-made family and the ability for them to Heal Each Other.  I know there are a lot of people who don't simplify it that far, but every time I try to read fic or meta about the ship I find my eyebrows creeping up into my hairline and then wandering away, muttering to myself in confusion.

I. I like Hotch/Reid because the amount of time they've known each other, the amount of trust they have in each other.  I get what they would see in each other. I get why it could work. I get why it could be good for them. I also get why it would be very, very bad for them and why it wouldn't work.  I can see the good moments, and I can also clearly see the absolute fights from hell and stony silences and breakdowns. 

</lj-cut>

TL;DR: I WANT ISSUES IN MY SHIPS and my brain is breaky."

"event","I was going to do a playlist, but then <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmb8_KsrNSQ"">Stuttering</a> popped up on itunes and I found myself with lots and lots of thinky thoughts about Hotch and Haley. 

<lj-cut text=""Cut for length"">

Fandom being what it is, there's a real tendency to make Haley out to be a bitch, and I find that unfortunate because I actually find it easy to sympathize with her.  

Do I think she cheated on Hotch?  Actually, yeah, but unlike the younger fan!twits, I don't think that makes her an evil, or even bad person.  Like I said, I really, really sympathize with her.  Yes, even with the cheating. 

We know from canon that they've known each other for more than twenty five years.  That's a long fucking time, folks.  Now, they weren't married that long, and we don't know how long they were a romantic couple, but that's not as important as remembering that their relationship (friendship, romance, whatever) was a long one.  She was Hotch's best friend, and presumably he was hers.  Add in to that the fact that we *know* that she wasn't working after Jack was born, and you know what you've got?  

Isolation and dependence.   Hotch? Wasn't just gone 9-5, working and coming home at the end of the day to give her some relief from child-care and be there to listen to her. Hotch was traveling, and doing a really dangerous job that could very easily get him killed at any given time.  That leaves her alone with a kid and no father.  That's some scary shit, even if you remove the fear and loneliness that can't ever really be removed.  She's got Jess, but.  That's not the same and I think we all know it. Heck, most of her family's in what, Georgia?

So, yeah. I can understand her cheating without making her an evil, or even bad person. More than that, and perhaps relevant to the thing fandom uses to beat her over the head with, I understand why she was begging, pleading and threatening for Hotch to take that transfer to White Collar Crimes.  In the end, much as I love and adore Hotch, I understand why he's not someone you want to be married to, or have a child with. 

He's not there. He's not part of Jack's daily life.  He's the weekend father, even before Haley leaves him.  He's the fun guy, and he's good enough with Jack, but he's not a steady parental presence in the child's life.  Haley is, essentially, raising the kid alone while she's still married.  Haley's alone while they're still married.  Hell <i>yes</i>, if I was married to Hotch I'd be telling him to either get in or get out, but to stop being a part-time husband and father so he can be a full-time FBI agent. 

Not to mention the relative lack of wisdom of spreading out murder victims who've had their hearts craved out all over the coffee table when your kid is home, just upstairs taking a nap.  That'd be fun and traumatizing for life.

And let's remember: BAU is Hotch's third career move.  He started out in <i>law</i>.  From law to FBI is a jump that Haley may have supported but that had to be hard to take.  Even SWAT, while dangerous and scary, isn't quite the same level of eating his brain and life as the BAU. If it had, he wouldn't have left it, I don't think.   And there's general trauma associated with what Hotch is doing, and how that trauma has changed Hotch.  

I just. I'm sorry.  I ache for them both. I know Hotch loved her. I suspect she loved Hotch. I doubt seriously she got a divorce because she was bored with him. I think she got a divorce so she could have a life and not be tied to someone who wasn't really there, anyway.  Hotch being Hotch, I suspect, was fully aware of that.

And I'll be completely shocked and surprised if Jack doesn't someday, realize that Hotch's job is 'more important' than him, and that the job got Haley killed and. Resent the hell out of Hotch and the BAU, in ways very, very similar to the way Haley did.  

I love Hotch but he is <i>not</i> perfect."

I want to be able to breathe through my nose in 2011.  That's my resolution and goal.  I think it's completely attainable, right? 

My kids are coming back from a 10 day stay with my mom today, which is all kinds of cool. They start school on Monday though which is way less cool. 

Fandom journal entry needs fandom content, so:
A-) Hotch, don't bite Reid. I don't care how much you want to, it <I>really</i> won't help. 
B-) Playlisting Hotch."

"event","I have played with the same core group of people for years (and years and years and - more than 5, less than 8 of them.  New people come in and that's always all kinds of awesome. Recently I collected a <lj user=""Miss_Zedem""> and that was even more kinds of awesome, for she rocks like a rocking thing.  Her Reid is the best thing ever, and is, you know, a real live adult fake person. 

You're waiting for me to tell you what's not so awesome, aren't you?  Okay, I can do that. 

The other thing I did recently was start playing in 'dressing rooms'.  Big, panfandom places where everyone can come in and play.  A lot of that's awesome, too, because it's a quick way to find RP without too much work.  It's fun, it's a good time, I really have no room to complain. I'm <i>not</i> complaining about the system, the set-up, or the games. 

I am, however, complaining like mad about 90% of the Reids I've encountered in these places.  Look, you want to play Reid as emotionally/mentally being 12?  That's fine, but if you do that please for the love of GOD don't expect Hotch to sleep with him.   The combination of the infantile behaviour, neediness, and generally reminding Hotch of his 5 year old, and wanting *sex* from him <i>does not work</i>.

Admittedly very little of this is what I would consider 'real' fic, but it's still just shy of 20,000 words in a month and after years of writing nothing? I'm calling that a pretty substantial win."

Most fun I've had in ages and since my husband was with me and we were high on Christmas Candy we merrily slashed everyone, everywhere, every way. 

Also watched the Who Christmas Special and had added bits of fun and glee there. 

Kids are with my mom this week.  I foresee writing in my future. Or maybe just role-play. Mostly? Laziness and self-indulgence in whatever form sounds like a good idea at the time.

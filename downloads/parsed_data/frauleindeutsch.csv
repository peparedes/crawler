Every day it gets better. I am starting to like the fact that I am here, and I am no longer home sick. (which that alone is a great accomplishment)

Hey I'm gonna go to bed and finish writing this tomarrow as if I didn't stop....sorry but I'm tired."

"event","Hello, I have been reading all of the wonderful suggestions everyone has given to others. I was hoping that people could help me figure my first trip out. I have lived in Cologne, Germany for the past three months and have not been able to do much traveling throughout Europe yet. I have my first chance to take a trip Dec. 10th-13th. I was thinking of making it a semi-romantic weekend, but have still yet to ask the special someone to go with me, so I may be going alone. Either way I am going! Now for the few questions... what is the best way to travel there...train or air? If going by air, what are some suggested discount airlines to look for tickets, I know ryanair.com and hlx.com. What are some good websites to look for hostels, B&B's, or other ways to stay over night and have a magical feel of the city. I have never been to Venice and this might be the only time I get to go, what are things I should not miss doing?

Thank you for any suggestions that you may have!!!!!"

PnkRckChc27: and now im being a spoiled brat that had this given to her on a silver platter and im whinning

wich21: its all good

PnkRckChc27: ii think thats one of the hardest hings for me to deal with right now is the fact that i have been given this and i should be happy, but im not happy, or maybe im just not letting myself be happy

wich21: yeah..i understand...but just think...in germany you really have to worries..or responsiblities...LIVE IT UP!

wich21: just let yourself go

PnkRckChc27: you know,.....I m not exactly sure why I am so unhappy..... I cant point out any particular reason for it, other than saying im homesick, but i dont even think its so much homesickness, ... but i cant quite put my finger on what it is though

wich21: hm...i dont' know
wich21: maybe its cuz you don't have anyone there to turn to
wich21: you know what i'm saying..

"event","....so anyway, went up to north woods this weekend
with my brother to do a little camping and kayaking as
a last grasp of summer, since we really did shit all
year long. (we went to Penninsula State Park up in
Fish Creek if you are familiar with Door county) But
what I really want to tell you about is the Road Kill
Monkey that we found on the way up.  
About half way between Sturgeon Bay and Fish Creek is
a Place called Egg Harbor.   Just outside of egg
harbor, about 2 miles, My brother yells ""STOP!!!""
(I look at him like What the Fu** you don't have to
yell I'm Right here, and ask him why.)  ""Did you see
that!  there was a Monkey on the side of the road""  
(Silly Me, it just looked like about 4 million other
roadkill's that we passed on the way as I was trying
to watch the road at 70 mph trying to avoid creating
more!)
What? I said
""I swear that that was a Monkey!"" he said
Now that my Interest was peaked I pulled off the road
and we made our way back a couple of hundred yards to
the scene of the crime.  Sure enough.  It was a Dead
Monkey on the side of the road.
The 2 of us, Like idiots looked in amazement at this
poor Dead monkey that had been biffed by some
car.....(""Honey, I think you just hit a Monkey!"" 
""Nonsense....you drink too Much!"")
....and miraculously landed on the side of the road in
a sitting position like it was deep in thought.
(Probably thinking ""now is it look left, right and
left again or the other way around...""BAM!)
My Brother Ventured into the woods to fetch a Poking
stick to verify that the Monkey was indeed Dead, and
not just resting, even though it clearly had Blunt
force Trauma to the head, chest, and one leg was going
in the wrong direction, unless it was a Giraffe.  This
however also did not stop me from giving it a poke or
two with the stick as well. 
So for the rest of the week end we Theorised about:
A) How did that happen, and
B) WHAT THE HELL IS A MONKEY DOING IN NORTHERN
WISCONSIN?
Safe to say, the theories ranged from Alien abduction
in south America and he fell off a UFO over Wisconsin
while fending off little green men, to an Army of
Monkeys are dwelling in the earth to arise and take
over the U.P., and this brave little scout got hit
when he popped up to see where they were.  I'm sure I
will be thinking of it for weeks to come!
So That is my exciting story from this weekend!"

"event","I need to grow up and take hold of my life. I have been acting as if I am on vacation, and forgetting that life is still going on in the present. What I do now still matters to the rest of the world. I have broken every responsible bone in my body. Why have I given up on everything that I have worked so hard for in my life????

Even though I live in a new country for a little while, I will return to the States, and what happens to me there in the present does still matter. When I return, these things will come back to haunt me. I will have to deal with the demons that I create sooner or later. Why am I consciously trying to make demons? I have to face those things I am afraid to deal with!!"

"event","Everyday turns out to be a long day with both good and bad experiences. Without the bad, the good could never be great. There are days that I find myself crying, but in the end I know I am better for it and stronger. 

I continue to say that I want to be home, and one day I will be, but this is something that I have to do. If I had not done this, then I would probably never grow up into the adult that I am meant to become. Without this experience I would forever have to rely on my family. I would always be a catapiller, and never become a butterfly.

I know right now I may not be in my happiest mind, but when I look back at these experiences and read my old feelings, I will cherish all that has become me. It is only with these experiences that I can truly become whom God intends me to become, and also the woman that I want to become. 

Days may come and go, but these experiences shall always remain in my heart.

Sometimes I may wish that those that had encouraged me to go through with this experience had not done so, but in the end I know I would have regretted not coming to Germany. And even though those people may never read this, I do thank you all. I also have to thank you for being there for me this past month when I would call and tell you I wanted to come home. It's hard for me to be here when so much is going on at home. I know you all understand this, and thank you for being understanding and continuing to encourage me to stay on my path.

I can only once remember giving up on something, and I still look back and regret that race. But even though giving on this experience is something I would have regretted, I still would have given up. It is only with all of your encouragement that I am still here."

"event","I became an aunt last night. My brother Del had his first child. It's a boy named William Conner Mravik. He came at 6:30 p.m. and is 8 lbs. 2 oz. and 20 inches long. I wish I was there to see him in person and hold him. I am sad that I cannot be there. Today I called the Hyatt in Milwaukee and asked for them to send some flowers for me to the hospital. At least I can be there in spirit. 

Tonight we are having a BAR-B-Q and I really do not know the reason for it, but I am going to pretend that it is to celebrate William's birth. I wish that I was at the hosptal though. Life will go on."

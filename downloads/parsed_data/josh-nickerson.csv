Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny
Quite honestly one of the most insane movies I've seen in a while. Kind of like a buddy-road comedy blended with a rock opera, it moves very briskly and has the characters breaking into profanity laden songs every ten minutes or so. The rock-off battle against Satan is truely epic (and probably what inspired the last boss of Guitar Hero 3). Probably not for everyone, but if you like your flicks to be silly, you can't go wrong here. 

Farce of the Penguins
Even though the running time was shorter than Pick of Destiny, it sure FELT like a lot longer. A take off of March of the Penguins, featuring foul mouthed comedians voicing the penguins, it drags  a lot between a few funny sketches (such as a penguin voiced by Gilbert Gottfried complaining about freezing his balls off). Meh, not really worth it.

Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star
Another film spun off from the studio Adam Sandler created so his friends could make movies. David Spade spouts off some funny one-liners, and there are some laugh out loud segments, and the ""We Are the World"" spoof featuring former child actors during the end credits is hilarious. Sadly, the plot is incredibly thin and predictable, and there seems to be more ""story"" than laughs to be found here."

I picked up Phantom Hourglass for the DS, and at about 3 hours in, I'm really digging it thus far. I loved Wind Waker, and though I initially balked at the visuals, upon further viewing, I fell in love with the style. So when I found out the new Zelda game for the DS would be a direct sequel to Wind Waker, I naturally freaked out.

The stylus controls take a bit of getting used to, but it works great once you do. In about half an hour I was tapping and swiping across the screen like a pro. I also like being able to mark on the map points of interest, because I have a tendency of forgetting where I saw cracks in walls that could later be bombed for rupees. The graphics are pretty impressive for the portable too; I'd place them on a level that's between N64 and Gamecube level, leaning a bit more toward the latter. The story is pretty interesting too... no sign of Ganon, and a very ""Link's Awakening"" feel to it. Oh, and Linebeck? Quite possibly the best new character this year. His blatant disregard for Link's safety is outright hilarious at times.

If you haven't picked it up yet, I suggest getting it at Toys R Us, because this week you get a free guide with purchase. And of course, register it at Nintendo.com for a <a href=""http://www.nintendo.com/hourglass/index.jsp"">sweet bonus.</a>"

"event","Went and saw Evan Almighty this weekend, with some trepidation, seeing as how previous Carey-less sequels to Jim Carey movies have fared. Much to my surprise though, I came out rather pleased. The story is a bit predictable, and if you pay attention during the opening credits, you can pretty much tell where the ""great flood"" will come from. But it's a nice change of pace to have a relatively simple story in this season of blockbusters. It manages to pack in some laughs along with some solid messages without ever getting too preachy. Steve Carell has some great bits, attempting (and failing) to hide his slow transformation into Noah. I also liked the little nods to Carrell's ""Daily Show"" roots, up to Jon Stewart mocking Evan on the aforementioned Daily Show.

And c'mon. Morgan Freeman as God? That's just too damn awesome. And as commanded by Mr. Freeman in the final credits, I shall do the dance..."

So I got my parents a DS Lite for Xmas, complete with the Brain Age/Big Brain Academy package. So they're enjoying the brain training stuff (well, my mom more than my dad; he gets mad because the game doesn't recognize his pronounciation of ""blue"", and then he starts swearing at it). Anyway, a month or so goes by, so I decide to introduce them to a couple of new games. I decided to lend Mom my copy of ""Zoo Keeper"", since it was simple enough to play. She pops it in and plays with a it a bit, getting annoyed that the animals were ""glaring at her"" and not able to make any matches. So she eventually puts it down, and asks if I'm going to take it back with me.

""No,"" I said, ""I'll just leave it here in case you want to play it again.""

""Well, whatever.""

So about three days later, I drop by the house again, only to find her playing Zoo Keeper. As soon as I walk in, she yells at me to help her find a match, as she's running out of time. I quickly grab the stylus out of my own DS and we basically play co-op until she loses. Then she starts playing again.

Cut to this weekend. She's broken a million points on marathon mode, seen the ending several times, and has completely knocked my name off the top score charts. She is a Zoo Keeper FIEND! Of course, she feels guilty that she hasn't checked in with Brain Age for a while, and says that the ""Big Giant Head guy"" will be mad with her for not checking in every day.

For reference, the last time my mom played a video game at any length was Dr. Mario for the NES. I think it's safe to say that Nintendo's bid towards the average non-gamer was INCREDIBLY successful.

I think I'll introduce them to Tetris DS next weekend. I doubt I'll ever get my copy back though... *L*"

"event","Back in the heyday of gaming, there were only two... Nintendo and Sega (... well, okay, there was the TG-16, but I honestly never knew anyone who actually owned one until a few years ago). And each had a mascot battling for our affections (and dollars), the stout plumber Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b235/joshnickerson/sonic.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

Sonic was a fun character, and poised as the successor of Mario's platforming throne. He blasted through stages, collecting coins, er, rings, and battling an evil mad scientist bent on world domination. He got a couple of new sidekicks, such as Tails and Amy, some new rivals, like Knuckles, and went on to star in some very successful side scrollers, and even two(!) cartoon series.

But somewhere along the way, Sonic got lost. Perhaps it was the fact that the original games, though fun, were very shallow, replacing exploration with pure speed. Or maybe it was the fact that Sonic missed an entire platform generation with the Saturn... Sonic 3-D Blast was just a quickie port of the Genesis title, and Sonic R and Sonic Jam were only racing and compilation games respectively (though they did provide an omnious omen to Sonic Team's inability to operate in a 3-D space). But by the time 3-D platformers such as Mario 64 had defined the 3-D genre, Sonic was unable, or maybe unwilling, to adapt. The Dreamcast titles, though fun in parts, were at time unplayable, due to horrendous controls and an awful camera system. They also made a terrible choice in adding several new characters in each game, all of which just slowed Sonic down, with Sonic Adventure 2 committing the ultimate sin of dumping Shadow the Hedgehog into the world.

It also didn't help that soon after his lackluster 3-D debut, Sega announced it was leaving the hardware business, leaving Sonic in the foster care of Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft. Following the Dreamcast titles, Sega promised to ""reinvigorate"" the series with a brand new 3-D entry, Sonic Heroes, and focus exclusively on speed. While the new game fixed SOME of the problems, namely the lame treasure hunting or fishing levels, the game unloaded yet more new characters that no one cared for. Not to mention that the controls were glitchy at best and the camera was still pretty bad.

Sega soon followed up with the ultimate travesty... ""Shadow the Hedgehog"". Giving the angst-filled doppleganger of Sonic his own game was bad enough, but allowing him to shoot realistic guns was even worse. The game mechanics were still broken as well, as if Sonic Team had learned NOTHING since the first Dreamcast title.

Oh, and somewhere along the line, they released Sonic Riders, which completely sucked and unloaded even more shitty new characters into Sonic's world.

Then comes the new ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" for the 360 and PS3. Once again, Sega promised that they would be ""reinventing"" the series, and that it would be the best Sonic game yet.

Well, no surprises here, it turned out to be the WORST Sonic game yet. Broken controls, horrible camera system, glitches galore, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naVshTpD9l0"">INSANE</a> load times, yet MORE new playable characters, and a creepy human/hedgehog romance angle utterly destroyed any dignity Sonic had left. 

Oddly enough, the best Sonic game released in ten years was the relatively overlooked Sonic Rush for the DS, and it wasn't even developed by Sonic Team, but rather DIMPS, which developed the Sonic Advance series for the GBA. It was an excellent side scroller, with a slick touch screen bonus stage, marred only by, you guessed it, a new character, but since she was so similar to Sonic, it really didn't matter much.

Which brings us to Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii... and why I think it might actually be... gulp... good? From the gameplay videos I've seen, and the impressions I've read, it is a VAST improvement to Sonic games of late, and actually fixes the problems that have troubled the hedgehog since his jump to 3-D. The camera is fixed, and Sonic is basically on auto-run, effectively putting the game on rails. And Sonic is the only playable character. No Shadow. No endless treasure hunts with Knuckles or pointless shooting stages with Tails. Just the blue blur. As it should be. Of course, I'm waiting until I play the final product before I pass verdict, but the future looks very promising.

I just find it ironic that Sonic might finally find salvation on a Nintendo console. Didn't see that one coming."

This Saturday marks the first new episode of Kim Possible since early 2005. What makes it so special is that the series hit the ""limit"" of 65 episodes that Disney imposes on all its series, and wrapped things up with an excellent moviefilm that ended with not only the foiling of Dr. Drakken's most evil plot to date, but Kim and Ron finally hooking up after three seasons of teasing.

But then things changed, after a massive letter writing campaign and some changes in the higher ups at Disney, and Kim Possible was put back into production for a fourth season.

I'm stoked. Kim Possible is one of the best 'toons to come out of Disney, I'd dare say it's the best animated series they've done since Gargoyles. I've pretty much watched it ever since it debuted, mainly attracted to the awesome flat retro style and the smart writing. I especially liked that fact that Kim didn't try to hide her ""super teen"" side; that is SO overdone in kid's shows. Instead, everyone seems to take her adventures in stride, as if it was the most natural thing in the world for her to stay out late to infiltrate some evil scientist's lair. The animation is also very slick, and has only gotten better with each progressing season. As if you couldn't tell, I was influenced a bit by the show's character design when I was revamping ""The Nolans"", among countless other influences that is. It's a great show, and deserves another season, if only just to give us one last encore.

Oh, and before you write it off as some girl show, just remember other awesome shows with female leads, like Buffy or Alias."

EDIT @ 9:00 - Oh, man, I was just about to go to bed last night when the idea for this just shot through my brain. I knew I'd forget about it completely the next morning, so I stayed up late just to draw and finish it, and I also sent it in to Flagpole for good measure. Not my best art by a long shot (and I hated resorting to what is basically a ""cut and paste"" comic), but well, judge for yerself."

Just got a call that my copy of Phoenix Wright: Justice For All should be in the store tomorrow afternoon. I actually wasn't going to buy it on launch day, but at the last minute I dropped a pre-order just to get that sweet looking stylus. Hopefully not too many other people pre-ordered, so I will still get a shot at it. Shamefully, I have yet to finish the first game, I got stuck on the fourth case and pretty much haven't touched it for a few months. I guess I'll need to finish it first to avoid any spoilers that might pop up in the sequel.

"event","So I was at Burger King yesterday, treating myself to a BK Stacker... that burger that skimps on the wimpy ""vegetables"" and slaps a second patty with a delightful blend of cheese and pickles... you know, a heart attack in a paper wrapper. Anyway, while I was enjoying said tasty food, I noticed something odd. A lady was going from table to table, introducing herself to the diners and then proceeded to attempt to sell them merchandise from her bag. She was in no way related to BK, she had merely come in off the street to sell to the patrons. She was selling what appeared to be fluorecent lanters and UGA themed gloves. For some reason, she skipped over me, I guess I didn't look like I had any money. As far as I could tell, no one took her up on her sales pitch, and she went outside, where I could see her meeting up with two other similar ladies, each with a bag of their own. I should note, she wasn't someone off the street, she was dressed in a business suit. Just very weird. Has this ever happened to anyone, you're enjoying a meal and suddenly someone comes up to you and tries to sell you shit? Weird.

Anyway, enjoy.

Well, as I posted below, I finished Twilight Princess last night. I was having trouble with the final boss, but it turned out that I was doing something when I really shouldn't have been doing said thing. You'll find out. Anyway, I clocked in at just under 45 hours, which is not a bad play-length. Of course, I've still got a few more stray Heart Pieces to round up, as well as some Bomb bag and quiver upgrades that I passed over.

Best Zelda ever? Well, that's certainly up for debate, but it was certainly a standout entry in an already stellar series of games.

As for what's gonna take up my time now? Well, I got a Legend of Starfi DS game from Joe for Xmas (a Nintendo game series that never made it over to the US), and it's a cute little platformer with puzzle elements. It's quite a bit like the Kirby series, though you don't absorb the powers of your enemies.

Gift-wise I scored some new duds and DVD sets (SNL Season 1 and Simpsons S9 specifically), and the usual game assault from Joe. I also got my parents a DS Lite with some brain games. Should be interesting to see how they deal with it, especially since the concept of using a stylus was so befuddling to them.

So how is everyone else doin'?"

"event","Tom: It's quiet in the cold of our own little orbit, starless and bible black. And as I look down on the big blue beam we would call home I think it so near, yet... oh, I wish on that star and I hope that in a little snow-covered house with a warm hearth and a loving family, maybe some kid is looking up tonight and wishing upon us. Oh, and how I hope sweet Santa will fly by tonight, because if he does I'm gonna reach right out and hug that big guy. Oh, for the sound of hooves against the steel hull of the ship. Oh, to see the rosy face of Santa in the porthole, offering me a Coke and a smile... (gradually becoming upset) ...of course, his cheeks WOULD be rosy because it's a VACUUM out there! I mean, Santa's HEART would explode! (becoming hysterical) But HE wouldn't feel it because the capillaries in his brain would pop like little firecrackers (Joel tries to calm him down) due to the blood boiling away in his face like pudding in a copper...OH THE HUMANITY!! (Now both Joel and  Crow are trying to calm him down.) And his jolly old belly would start bubbling like a roasted marshmallow, eyes bulging and popping out... AND THE REINDEER--OH THE REINDEER!!!--keep bloating like holiday floats and in turn exploding in a hail of blood and entrails! Prancer--BOOM! Dancer--BOOM!...
Joel: HEY!
Crow: Tom!
Joel: Tom, take it easy! Santa's gonna be okay, buddy.
Tom: You sure?
Joel: Yeah, give him a little credit, okay?
Tom: Phew, what a relief!"

"event","So this week I got two new games, despite the fact that Twilight Princess for the Cube will become priority #1 come next Tuesday. Whatever. The first one I got was Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, which I mainly got just for the super-cool bonus (in case you're unaware, pre-ordering it got you a 20th Anniversary package, which includes an art book and soundtrack CD, among other goodies). Now, I haven't played Castlevania since the NES days, but what I've played so far is pretty good, despite the fact I can't get past the first boss. Seriously, I only last about five seconds before I see the Game Over screen. Not cool. I like the dual character aspect, even though I rarely use the girl except for Team Attacks, and the upgrades you find along the way are pretty neat. If I can get past the first boss, I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest of the game *L*.

And the other game I picked up was Tomb Raider Legend for the 'Cube. Yeah, I'm not quite sure why, cause I pretty much despised the original games. I think I played the original on the PS1 for about thirty minutes before I gave up in disgust at the lousy controls. But, surprisingly, this one's actually pretty decent. The controls don't suck anymore, and there are some very Zelda-esque puzzles to be found. So far the only problems I really have is that the gunplay isn't as refined as I would've hoped, and the frame rate occasionally bogs down. Otherwise, it's solid. Too bad it took 'em ten years to get it right.

Hmmm, I need to get back to writing comics."

Somehow I've been injuring my hands all week at work, either thru paper cuts, or burns from a hot copier, or cutting my finger on some stupid printer part. I'll be thankful if I survive the week without chopping my head clean off.

Comic wise, I really haven't had much time to draw, which makes me thankful I have a large buffer for The Nolans. I've got comics queued up thru January, so no worries there. I'm also trying to work on my homepage, though it's gonna be hard to find stuff to fill it with, since I lost everything in the infamous hard drive crash in June.

Could this BE a more boring entry? *L*"

"event","So my best friend Joe and I have what we like to call ""Xmas Wars"". Basically, we try to outdo each other by getting something awesome for the other. I won the previous two years in a row (last year I scored him a copy of Air Zonk), but I think my reign will soon be at an end.

He remixed Super Mario Bros. 3.... and GOT IT BURNED ONTO AN ACTUAL NES CART.

I can't wait to play this thing. He's been teasing me about it for a year while he's worked on it, he even allowed me to design the label art (cart pic forthcoming). Now I just gotta wait until Xmas day to find out just how good an even more difficult Mario 3 can be."

If you want to find out just how resiliant the touch screen on your DS is, just buy Elite Beat Agents. Yes, I've been pimping this game a lot lately, but it's JUST THAT GOOD... even if the difficulty level was obviously set by Satan himself. Honestly, the damn easy mode is probably difficult enough for most gamers... I could hardly imagine a casual gamer being able to keep up past Episode Five. But hey, I'm not exactly the most rhythmic person either. Of course, what really steams me are these people whining that the game is too EASY. I'd like to meet these people... they're either full faced liars, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtQDOQmcaTM"">cranked-up, hyperactive Japanese kids on Ritalin.</a>

Despite the difficulty level, it's STILL a must have game. It manages to spank you soundly, but still keep you coming back for ""just one more try"". Yah."

Thus ends another average week in the grand adventures of Josh Nickerson. Aside from screwing with the minds of some religious fanatics, it's been pretty tame this week. Well, it's Friday night, I have no date, a two liter bottle of Shasta, and my all 'Rush' mix tape.

Let's rock.

I'll probably play some Elite Beat Agents (most addictive DS game since Meteos), but more than likely I'll draw some more Nolans strips until the wee hours. Woot!

Just had a couple of bible thumpers knock on my door, asking me if I was prepared for my Final Judgement.

Me: ""Oh, don't worry, I'm prepared.""

Overly stiff bible guy: ""If you don't mind me asking, HOW are you prepared?""

Me: ""I saved up a lotta money. Gonna bribe God.""

Overly stiff bible guy: ""Good bye."" *probably thinking ""...in HELL!""*

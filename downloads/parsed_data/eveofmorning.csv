I have never took the time to breathe before and for my health and sanity i will make a point to breathe everyday. Did you ever feel like that? I am just now. I am 27 and i feel like i havent breathed in forever and now i feel that i can. I cant worry about everyone and their problems when my job and my health are more important. I guess i am a little selfish but i feel in order to make my life better i have to be better first."

We call up sarah and let her know plans are changed and she said she doenst want to go to bw3 and she will go meet chrisitne at the other bar. I get a text from sarah later saying i cant go to bw3 cause my ex boyfriends go there. Me and dani were like geez grow up alittle. Her ex boyfriends werent even there. Oh me and dani were just upset cause she is acting immature then she plays a guilt trip and makes us feel bad that we went somewhere she couldnt go. I dont get people like that."

The reason why i say this is because i saw the movie 17 again and it was really good and that highschool musical guy was good to look at too. I saw it with my sister and she is graduating highschool in may and it got me thinking about what i would want to do over again and maybe change my life alittle differently."

It has been going fast and year is flying again.
I love to spring clean! I am trying to go through everything and put stuff in the trash and save clothes and things for people. I love going through and finding a little treasure here and there. I need to be more organized. It is hard when you only have so much space, i figure if stephen and i ever move in together i need to get a bigger place, cause having a small bedroom closet and a nice size living room closet i really need to take advantage of the space which is hard. Next week is my full week so i will try to do alittle every day and see what i can organize.

Change of the seasons also means changes for me. I am going to get my hair cut and get some highlights done. I want to do at least a caramel and darker brown or something that would be a little natural yet pretty for the summer, no blonde highlights this time. I also want to try and go to a place to donate my hair for locks of love."

"event","I get a lot of liars on the phone and i can spot them pretty quickly from what they say. I dont mind if they lie cause usually it is easy to catch and turn around make the situation better. I dont like when a friend will say one thing and then you find out later that they lied to you. What is so hard about telling the truth? I would rather you say ""hey i dont want to go to that place because i feel uncomfortable"" or ""hey i got plans maybe another time"" What is so hard with that? Sometimes I feel that they do this so they dont hurt your feelings which is all fine and dandy until you get caught. When you get caught then it is different. That person will not trust you anymore or view you differently, maybe not tell you secrets like they used to. I find it sad that there are more liars in this world then honest people. I tend to say what is on my mind so i need to be careful on that in the future and think before i say anything that i will regret. It is something i need to work on."

Me, Stephen, danielle and her boyfriend steve and brother john, and christine and sarah went all out to play pool at roumines. Well sarah came with us and everyone else drove seperate. Christine and sarah went to get taco bell and were gone for 45 min and then finally sarah called saying they were lost and back on the highway. I was actually surprised that christine didnt have her gps and i knew sarah wanted to go out and get to know danielle and stuff but that didnt happen. Christine ended up taking sarah back to her car at my place and then going home. I get a call from sarah maybe 2 hours later saying she is home and safe and that christine wasnt that great of a driver cause she drove on the wrong side of the street and didnt understand directions that well. I feel bad cause i should have gone with them but taco bell was a block away. They must of drove in a crazy way. So tonight i am taking sarah out for dinner cause i felt bad. I know it is not my fault but I mean i dont understand chrisitne at all sometimes."

"event","I believe that friends come and go but true friends are there for you. I was there for someone when they were going through a pregnancy scare and they didnt take my advice and decided to do something different but still it turned out to be ok. So i ask her, ""how are you going to protect yourself in the future from this?"" and she responds.. ""i""ll just say no."" I guess you dont live and learn. 

I was hopeing she would live through the experience and learn from her mistakes but she hasnt yet. I give her time and advice and she treats me like i am garbadge.  I think she needs to grow up a little and learn how to depend on herself. Right now christines parents are convincing dani to move in with her in the apartment that her parents are paying for and pay the parents rent. Hmmm i dont think so and dani says no as well. She said she would rather live with her parents and not pay rent and save for goiing back to school. Better idea i think. 

I am just trying to surround myself with positive people who are doing things in their lives that are what i think is positive. Just found out my friend wants to go back to school for nursing or teaching. I am so happy for her! Another friend wants to get a condo and the other wants a new car. Yay!
But christine i feel is not making my life positive in any way. I am trying to not hang out with her but when i do i feel like i am there just to watch her talk to guys at the bar. I feel like third wheel. Christine told dani that she shouldnt need to babysit me while we are at the bar. I thought well that is kinda weird to say but at least i know what she means but she doenst understand why i feel like third wheel. I feel like third wheel cause when i meet her at the bar i expect her to talk to me but she talks to guys instead and she doesnt get that. I explained this to dani and she understood so why cant christine?

Yeah you are just hanging out whatever. I felt really disrespected so i will tell her tonight how i felt about that and hopefully she will understand. She didnt last time we had a problem. I have had some bad spells already with her.

11th. Hello i need a response asap and the excuse oh i was really busy. I think that is a little rude. I understand slow typing but usually people respond that same time or a little bit later. Come on now people!

Went to chicago on sunday and took some pretty pictures and it was easy to get to the train thanks to easy directions from liz..yay. I only bought some boots at payless and a shirt. I lost my hat and mittens but that is ok. 
I got some great pictures of the city and christine definitely wants to do this again next year for her birthday just invite more people which means invite my friends...ugh whatever on that.

"event","So i have till monday to pass my scorecard and things arent looking too good at work. I have been trying to do the best i can and if i dont pass i get terminated. I really am upset i have had nightmares and havent been able to sleep well.  They only gave me a 4 day notice too which is completely unfair cause i have bills to pay. Hello! I was going to go talk to hr but now that is out of the question cause it is too late. If i pass my scorecard they can move me to another dept where they know i will succeed. 

I hope things work out... pray for me!"

"event","Well I got my review at work and it looks like i only have till the end of september to pass my scorecard otherwise they fire me. A word to the wise never do collections cause it is all based on a scorecard and you are competiting against other people who are better than you. It makes me sick how people will cheat and steal just to get ahead and then you suffer for it. That is what is happening to me. They cheat and steal and I can barely make it and apparently the supervisors dont understand this. Arg so just pray for me to pass my scorecard for september.I am passing now so i hope it does really help."

"event","Only working 7-11am friday and then off through wednesday. Call me up if you want to get together and hang out. Going to an art fair on sunday and bbq on saturday for a bit. 

I just need to relax and regroup for next week cause we are having our reviews and that means raises which i dont think i will get a high one cause of how i didnt do too well on my scorecard. So i dont know if they will move me to inbound or what. I will just have to see. I am just a little stressed about it all but i do know that everything will be alright."

It has pictures of thinspiration and such I love it. I'm at 109.4 right now I was 108 about a week before the cruise but when we left I was at 110. I came home weighing a gross 115 and that's even after purging once or twice a day.</p><p>Now I'm fighting to be below 108 because I keep staying at 110 and that's not good enough. I have huge love handles I want to get rid of but that's not going well. Justin loves my ass so I'm over it having a little extra fat just gotta get rid of the muffin top.</p><p>I'm planning on doing a 5k in aug, half marathon September and marathon in October!

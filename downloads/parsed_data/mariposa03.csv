"event","OOPSIES! I made a douple Entry and I don't know how to delete it..... soooooo...

Here is a random thought! XD Be amazed by the depths of my mind! =o

okay..... Yesterday i was thinking about the word ""Whatever""

Which my lil sister uses waaay too much and it just gets on my nerve!!! >w<

anywho.... the basic phrase can be translated to ""I Don't care"" or ""your opinion is pointless""

but if you really think about it... those two words ""what"" and ""ever"" don't imply that translation at all! In fact those two words make absolutely no sense together!!!! =o

its mind boggling.......... >.> at least for me.

and so yes! there it is! Am I deep or what? ^_^

o.o....... okay maybe not.

(another random moment) >.>.... hmmm.... the guy sitting next to me at the computer lounge is really cute! >w< gah.... i really need a social life! XD...."

so i realllly dont have anything important to say.... o.o so I shall ramble on and on... and you shall enjoy it!..... ENJOY IT I SAY! >=D

Today Im going to try to reorganize my room... o.o its not happy right now.. and it wants to be! I SHALL MAKE YOU A HAPPY HAVEN ON HELLO KITTY AND ANIMEISH STUFFAGE! >=D *hugs sad bedroom* ^.^

it needs more posters... and i need to get some shelves.. i have so many dolls, not all of the fit on my bed! XD

and im also trying to decide if i want the bed centered... or pushed to the wall. If pushed to the wall i will have more room and I can fit more dollies on it... but it looks nice in the center! and i have a storage thingie that will be covored if pushed to the wall@.@ I dunnno.

I would take a piccie of it but my camera hates me! ;-; it wont send my piccies to the compy.... so i bite it... and it still didnt work.... hmm...>>   <<

I have come to the realization that I am in love... with a dancing bunny!

<P>Hoping that we don't get lost!! O.o </P>
<P>its really easy to do here in England! See, there are these things called Roundabouts... they are EVERYWHERE in England! and it's really easy to turn off on the wrong exit! So... on our first day in England.. we ended up on a 5-way roundabout!!!!!!! O.O The King of all RoundAbouts!!! X.x</P>
<P>Guess what we did!!! we took the wrong exit, ended up on a freeway (no U turns!) and we were on our way to London at about 9:00 PM! LOL</P>
<P>That was intersting! so, I'm not sure if tomorrow is going to go that way again! i hope we get a good map before we leave at least!!!! ^.^</P>
<P>well, i'll let you all know how it goes! ^.^'''' wish us luck!</P>

"event","so the passed week or so has been a roller coaster.  mostly highs...a couple lows.

first...i called Elizabeth and asked her out for the that friday night.  unfortunately her sister was in town for the weekend.  so we decided to go out for the following weekend...which was last weekend.  we met up for dinner at El Vez, the steven starr restaurant.  it was awesome...and cheap considering it was restaurant week.  in any case we were there for about 3 hours.  we hadn't known coz we were talking so much.  after dinner we headed over to the medusa bar only coz she's never been there.  and she loved it!  she even got me to dance once it was packed enough.  and that was it.  no, i didn't kiss her.  yes i paid for dinner, but she insisted that we took turns on the drinks.  ok fine i did kiss her, but only on the cheek right before i put her in a cab.  we're trying to get together again this weekend, but we'll see.  

in other news, work has kicked my ass and i've kicked it right back.  yeah...i had a whole bunch of work dumped on me.  but i kicked ass at the end of last week so now i'm well ahead...that is until i caught the flu and missed a day and a half this week already.

oh and for the best news?  Straylight Run is playing at the Troc on April 1st!  you people have no idea how excited i am that.  i haven't been this into a band since Quicksand, Sense Field, or Rainer Maria.  i know i saw them at Drexel last year, but that was nothing...it was a 6 song quick set in front of maybe 200 people, if that...opening for Unwritten Law.  this time they're headlining and i'm guessing there's gonna be a few hundred people there to see them.  i cannot fucking wait.

btw, i recently found this pic of me and kira. i dont' know why, but it always makes me smile

about what?

calling Elizabeth tonight.  i don't know why i am.  is it possible i like her that much?  i don't know...i guess i do...i maybe over thinking this whole thing...it's just a phone call.  i mean i've asked girls out before...but this time it's different and i don't know why it is.

SONS OF BITCHES!!!!

oh and so last night...i was so prepared to just go and do nothing by myself at home after work.  then Kira had to say we should get a drink and dinner.  so i agreed.  we ended up going to the Tap Room...coz it was also Quizzo night there.  so a few beers, Quizzo, and paying for dinner Kira gives me this look like she wants me to walk her home.  ok so i do.  i didn't mind walking her home, but it was the look she gave me that messed me up.  yeah it was that look.  why give me that look after we've talked about our new flings all night?  if it weren't for Elizabeth i'd hate women right now.  like i mean, seriously!"

so that was basically my weekend.  oh yeah, that and i met a girl on friday night...her name is Elizabeth...AND she asked for my number first...no, i haven't called her yet.  normally i would've called by now, but with Valentines Day tomorrow i didn't want to seem too eager.  i don't know  i could be wrong, but i will call wednesday or thursday...no, wait...wednesday.  kira and i have a show on thursday night.  anyways, i just thought it was weird and awesome that i met someone so easily like that.  i just can't get over her asking me for my number first.  especially with the way things are with kira...you know, with her having a date last friday night and all...i was down a bit because of that, and then BAM...Elizabeth comes along.  she's so awesome...i can't wait to hangout with her again."

Last year the lineup was pretty awesome...Straylight Run played ;p...anyways,  curious, i went and checked out the Bamboozle website http://thebamboozle.com/ and it's a kickass lineup for both days...Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, June, The Rocket Summer, Motion City Soundtrack, Mae, and Bayside to name just a few.

ok so i email everyone that i knew would be interested in going.  Amber said yes, Jenn said no, no word from my brother, Mike said yes, and kira?  well she emails me back saying that her and kristie have made May 6th as the day of Megan's Bridal shower and guys are invited...and so being part of the wedding party, i have to be there.  WHAT THE FUCK???? 
i can, however, miss the first day and just go to the second day...but i'll be missing Fall Out Boy, Thursday, Mae, Bayside, AND The Rocket Summer.  That leaves, TBS, and June as the only bands i'd really love to see.

<i><b>The Tension And The Terror</b>

All the boys voices cracking,
Oh, the moaning half tones,
Come summer time,
We're all the same age here,
All the tension and the terror,
Thin limbed gorgeous green eyes smiling,
And I'm going straight to hell,
All the possibility and promise just,
Weighs on me so heavily,

And I try but I'm not convincing,
Your lips they pout and twist and,
I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you,
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
It's somehow all I need just keep me guessing please,

Oh darling all of these awkward jump-start-stalling conversations,
Mean much more to me than anything,
So it comes down to me and you and,
Whether were supposed to or not we still will,
We're so much better off than them,
All the possibility and promise just,
Weighs on me so heavily,

And I try but I'm not convincing,
Your lips they pout and twist and,
I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you,
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
It's somehow all I need just keep me guessing please!

A look,
A laugh,
A smile,
A second,
Passes by and I regret it,
Words just aren't right,
Sometimes I just can't explain,
All the ways you devastate me,
Always on my mind,

I try but I'm not convincing,
Your lips they pout and twist and,
I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you,
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
It's somehow all I need just keep me guessing,

I'm doing this here again i know you don't read this.  

if there ever was a person i could be totally be happy with, it would be you.  i know before you wanted the same from me...when i wasn't quite ready for it...for reasons you know about.  now i'm ready...i've had closure with those issues...you don't know that because you dodn't seem interested in the thought of me and you...like i think you are right now.  

what kills me is nothing really has changed...except your unwillingness for us to happen, or am i wrong?  is it because we work together?  is it the fact that everyone basically thinks we're already dating?  is it charlotte?  jason?   i know we're closer now than ever before, but why can't we talk about this like we used to be able to?  i know we make each other happy...even at the shortest of moments...or over a horrible dinner, or an empty bar.  i tried seeing someone else, but all i could do is compare her to you...either i keep doing that and hope it goes away or hope that we happen.  i want us to happen.  

i just want us to have that first kiss again...but i know if and when it ever happens, it won't be quite as good...but the thought of it happening again is what keeps me going.  i would beg for it, but i can't do that to you.  i just want you to know that i would go to the end of the world to make you happy....even if it makes me sad

no one has ever made my heart beat quite like you do...NO ONE...you know that says a lot.

"event","So it was another random weekend.

What can i say?  it seems to be a trend now.  first it was last weekend with Boys Night Out.  one random weekend is fine, but to have another one the following weekend is a bit...well, random....or rather the start of a trend?

i was out with my brother and his friends on friday night.  it's all good and fine until i started playing pool.  no one else wanted to play so i decided to go and play and find a partner when my quarters came up.  and when they did i found a partner.  her name was Colleen.  she was there with her roommater, Vicky and Vicky's boyfriend, Jeff.  they were awesome people, especially Colleen.  we ended up hanging out the rest of the night.  by the rest of the night i mean the people i was at the bar with left without me...leaving me with people i'd just met.  which was fine...not like i tried to leave.  yada yada yada...i get drunk and end up at the girls' apartment....all the way in Manayunk.  Colleen and i hit it off really good...i won't say anything else and leave the rest of the evening to your imaginations.  

saturday, Scott's parents came down from Boston.  they took us out to lunch AND dinner.  gotta love Bob & Nancy.  however, we found out that afternoon that Kira's father had passed away.  she had called me to see if she can come over and hangout.  she didn't want to come home to an empty house...that's pretty understandable.  she never made it over, though...she ended up having dinner with her mom.  i still haven't seen her and i'm afraid to call her.  i know she's dealing with funeral arrangements and all.  i know she'll call me when she's good and ready.  apparently the funeral is on Thursday.  i wish there was something i could do or say, but there's really nothing more to do or say besides saying, 'i'll be here if you need anything.'  she's a strong girl, but i know she's  not holding up as well.

anywho, i saw June last night at the Pontiac Grille.  what an awesome show...they're great live.  btw, i got your shirt, Jenn.  i'll leave it with my brother when i stop by his place tonight."

"event","at least i partied with rock stars.

let me explain.

on sunday my brother, his roommate amber, amber's sister jenn, jenn's friend alyson, and I went to see Motion City Soundtrack, The Starting Line, and Fall Out Boy at the Electric Factory.  Boys Night Out also opened for them...i believe we missed Panic at the Disco.  in anycase, we were all upstairs at the bar the entire show.  after BNO played they ended up at the bar where Jenn began talking to Cody, the guitarist i believe.  after a while Conner, the singer, came up too.  after hanging out with them and seeing Fall Out Boy perform we were invited back to meet them at their bus.  OK yeah big deal, right?  i really didn't care, but being that i was 6 beers and 2 shots deep into the night i wanted to drink more, and these guys were very receptive to that.  Alyson had left after TSL and my brother just disappeared.  Conner had given Jenn and Amber passes to get into FOB's bus.  fine whatever, they said they'll be right out.  well they, and Conner, never came out and i was stuck with the rest of the band, except for Cody...who was probably hooking up with some 12 year old...

so there's me, standing in front of BNO's bus along with the rest of the band.  now i'd just met these guys and being that i'm good and drunk already, i'd forgotten their names.  all i know is that two of them were brothers.  and the chick (Kara?) was really cool and sweet.  well there were 6 of us total, and we all piled into a cab.  the funny part was, aside from Kara, i didn't know any of their names.  we ended up at Sugar Mom's coz, well, they asked what's a good bar and, without hesitation, i said Sugar Mom's...coz that's where i'm at 90% of the time when i'm out.  and so at the bar the band just started buying beers...i didn't pay a cent...not that it mattered, Chad knew me and would've hooked me up, regardless.  he did know what i wanted, whick was awesome.  so three beers and two more shots later i decide it was time to go home coz, well, i had to wake up 5 hours later.

the funniest part of the story is that i've never once heard any of BNO's songs before.  i think that i only did what i did because i want to say i did it.  will i see them again if they come back to town?  most likely not.  would i go up to them if i saw them on the street or at a bar?  probably not.  

but seriously, how many people can say they hung out with a band after their show.  let alone say they got invited back to their bus?  i didn't even get an autograph or free anything.  i wasn't there to be a groupie or a 'fan'.  i just wanted to drink beers.  

now on sunday i'm seeing June.  if i was presented with the same opportunity with them that night...i thinki i'd go a bit more hardcore.  no offense to BNO, but June is a much a better band.

btw, i got splashed today by a car driving by....fuckin' rain"

i may take friday off.  i'd like to play a round of golf, but stupid vince took my clubs last night for his company's golf outing.  i guess i'll be saving about $50 by doing so.  ok i'm trying to think of stuff to write about, but i'm not even motivated enough to do so.  getting this much written is already a surprise.  so, yeah that's it."

Normally there's one thing over the weekend that i do...just one.  that way i get it accomplished and feel happy that i accomplished something.  that can be anything from cleaning my room, doing laundry, or going golfing.

but knowing that scott and megan were gonna be away over the weekend i decided that instead of sitting in front of the TV all day, i would do somethings.  and so i made a list:

clean car
haircut
go to IKEA for new bed sheets/duvet
clean room/living room
get food for week

i accomplished 3 of 5.  yeah i know it's easy.  laugh it up.  but to me it's a lot and i'm proud of myself.  enough that i'm writing about it.  

i guess this isn't much of an update but it is.

oh and so on saturday night, kira and i saw Proof...the movie with Gwenyth Paltrow & Jake Gylenhaal.  mmm Gwenyth Paltrow.  i don't know why i like her.  i mean she's pretty and attractive, but you know, she's not hot like Misha Barton, or Iva Longoria...but if i had a choice between the three, i'd pick her first.  and no, i don't have a real reason why...i just do.  

anyways, this movie was far more intelligent than i was expecting.  maybe coz i was tired or whatever.  i was definitely really slow.  slow like when you're drunk slow...but i wasn't drunk.  it was weird coz kira said the same thing to me when we were in the subway. 

k well that's it for today..maybe even for the week...i don't know.  if something good happens or i get bored, i'll update again.  but for now...lates."

i went to see June (by myself) at the Pontiac Grille on friday night.  it was such a good show.  i got to see The Fold and Suicide Pact open up.  they're both pretty good, but pretty cliche in my mind.  then June came on.  they opened with OK Corral...which was coz being that it's my fav song of theirs.  i stayed a bit to see Tokyo Rose, but decided to leave since i knew the bus was gonna be a while.  

Ok so remember when i said i wasn't going out afterwards?  well, no, i did go straight home.  but i get home and scott's drinking the last beer.  THE LAST BEER!  so i decided to have some Hennesey on the rocks.  then scott had one, then i had another, then another...next thing we know there's enough for two glasses left.  i, as brilliant as i am, decided that we finish the bottle.  yeah real brilliant...i think i was still drunk when i got up 6 hours later.  so yeah scott and i were completely stupid working with matt on saturday.  but we did finish the floor.  it looks awesome too.  

when scott and i got back we both wanted to take naps, but i, being brilliant again, decided to hook up the new 80GB external hard drive that i bought for my own birthday present.  2 hours and two burgers later, i finish installing it.  I KNOW THEY'RE PLUG-N-PLAY!!!!  it just wasn't cooperating with me.  so by the time i had a chance to actually lay down it was nearly 8 o'clock.  we were supposed to meet everyone at the 10 Stone at 9 for my birthday.  so i rested for about 30 minutes before i jumped in the shower to get ready.  

the 10 Stone was ok...but it was cool everyone made it out.  and of course i got the birthday shots.  only two, but Janice got me this huge ass shot of tequila....and i nearly yacked because of it.  then scott got me a shot of Patron (topshelf tequila for the uneducated).  that was easier...but all Patron shots are easy....and smooth.

so yeah, scott and i were pretty stupid again on sunday morning, but i was up and awake by 9:30 (dont' ask).  got some Pat's and went to the market for food for the week.  had dinner with my siblings in china town and that was my birthday.  yeah, weeeee, i'm 25....whatever.

btw i gots the house all to myself this weekend as scott and megan left for mexico this morning."

so yeah, that'll be my evening.  i don't plan on going out afterwards since scott and i are working with matt again tomorrow.  i don't really want to, but i know he needs the help.  i am gonna be sore on sunday too, i just know it.  i was last sunday and it took me a couple days to get over it.  

the other day i got a card from my parents for my birthday.  they wrote me a check for $75.  i just lol'd coz i haven't really gotten present from them in years.  i haven't even deposited the check yet.  i probably won't, though it might pay for the next few shows i'm going to, or golf next weekend.  whatever. 

k i want to write more, but i really can't think right now coz i'm bored.  1 and a half hours left 'til i leave for home.  maybe i'll leave early so i can get into the Pontiac Grille early.  doors do open at 5, but there are 4 bands opening and i don't want to stand around by myself.  well at least there's a bar... :O"

"event","so i've decided that as part of my own gift for myself that i'm seeing June at the Pontiac Grille on friday.  i don't care if any had any plans to take me out that night.  you can meet me there if you like, i doubt it'll be sold out, it is the Pontiac Grille after all.  if not there's still saturday and $4 PBR/jager shots at the Dive.

so i've slept good the last two nights.  i guess my cold has gone away, though my allergies are still getting worse.  it was the kind of sleep where you close your eyes and next time you open them it's basically time to get up.  normally i'm waking up at the middle of the night once or twice.  i don't know if it's a good thing or not, but i kinda like waking up at 2am and thinking 'well, there's 5 and a half hours of sleep still.'

Jenn, stop calling me and not leaving a message

"event","well just the lower half of my body is hurting.  scott and i went to work with matt on saturdya laying new hardwood flooring down.  i thought that my back would be sore 'cos it was getting stiff by the end of the day saturday.  i guess starting to drink at 5pm that evening didn't help.  scott, megan, kira, and i went to a small block party.  kira and i stuck around until about 9.  at that point i'd had about 7 or 8 beers.  it didn't help that we went to the Dive bar to see Jim dj and celebrate his birthday.  $4 PBRs and jager shots.  see...that shit may sound awesome, but after a whole evening of drinking behind you already it doesn't help.  i was done and out by 12.  i didn't even say goodbye to anyone.  i just upped and left.  yeah i know it was an asshole thing to do to amy.  i'll email her today and say sorry.  

needless to say i woke up sore and hungover yesterday.  that's never a good combination.  at least i made it out of the house for about a half hour when i went and got food.  thank god for football yesterday, or else i would've been sitting home all day watching god knows what.

"event","nothing new to add.  it was a pretty uneventful weekend.  went to sugar mom's friday night and got to hang out with scott, paul, mark, emily and josh.  pretty tame night.  i drank way more than i thought i was able to since i had an empty stomach.  whatever.  saturday emily had annual daquiri party.  good stuff, but pretty boring since i fell tired for some reason.  all i did was see Star Wars.  dear god was that a great movie.  not quite up there with Return of the Jedi, but still damned good.  i'd love to see it again, but i doubt it'll happen.  Jay and paul should be in Columbia by now.  now it'll just be me and scott.  well there's matt too, but with the kid and all, i doubt we'll see much of him.  

i emailed margaret last week.  just to say hey and see how things were going with her.  i also didn't want her to think i'd completely forgotten about her.  her situation sucks big time, but i'm sure things will work out.  

anyways, things are looking up here in the office.  but i still think that i'll be moving on at some point in the summer.  probably after my North Carolina trip at the end of July.  the market is too damned good not to move on.  if i can start making anywhere from $45,000 to $50,000 i'd be ecstatic.  i'm asking for $50,000 where ever i interview.  if they meet me half way, i'd still win.  here's to hoping, eh?

right, i have to make this more than a weekly thing like before.

"event","hey so it's been a while, eh?  well nothing much has happened.  Paul & Jason's going away shin dig was fun.  it was an interesting group of people to say the least.  many worlds were colliding.  the keg was kicked fairly early which disappointed me coz i was just sticking to beer all night.  i also avoided doing shots as well which is surprising.  i did, however, end up staying at kira's place.  no, nothing happened.  i'm sure it was both in our heads though.  

i also paid off the rest of my North Carolina trip.  so all that's left to do is wait for the day to come.  though getting there is gonna be a pain in the ass.  8 and a half hours of driving.  driving/sitting in a car, it doesn't matter.  it's 8 and a half hours.  then it's 8 days of nothing, but beach, pool, and alcohol.  needless to say expect no updates from me during that time, though most of the people reading this will be with me, so yeah.

i've decided to go move in with scott and megan.  there's still a chance i might find something i like.  even if it's a studio apartment or something.  a studio would be clutch.  i don't need a lot of space.  i just need a bathroom, kitchen and a large bedroom for all my shit.  

as for the job situation, well that's still unclear, but i'm busy again and i should be for at least a couple more weeks.  

oh fuck how could i have forgotten.  i saw straylight run on saturday at drexel...thanks again jenn.  god they're awesome live.  and michelle is as hot as i expected though she showed up with her boyfriend.  whatever.

ok that's it.

"event","i think i've finally narrowed down my choices for where i'll be living next.  i'm seeing both place tomorrow.  the one i really like is $400 more a month than the other one.  i can't really afford the one i like.  but my new job (which ever one it'll be) will be paying more....much more, so i might be able to afford a $725/month rent.  i don't know.  the other one might be nice too, the area isn't so bad, it's in university city, close to the expressway and cabs will be a plenty.  it's still in the city and there'll be a lot people my age around.  i don't know, we'll see.

in other news jay and paul's going away party is tomrrow.  the E-vite shows 70+ people attending.  i doubt that's a real number.  some guy said he had 33 guests coming with him, which, obviously, is a farse.  it should be interesting at least.  saturday i get to see Straylight Run at Drexel University...thanks for the hook up, jenn =D.  my brother is going as well, i don't know why.  ok that is all for now.

<b>Mistakes we knew we were making</b>
Straylight Run

<i>And all our sins,
Come back to haunt us in the end,
To hang around and tap us on the shoulder,
And smile silent,
It's all implied,
You'll die trying to live this down,
You might as well forget it,
Still I'm convinced,
Wondering what if is the worst thing there is,

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets,
Let them ferment and came back to our senses,
Drove back home and slept a few days,
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be,

And all these lines fall short of what I had in mind,
A failed attempt to capsulize a feeling,
So I just try,
Fail and try and try again,
Someday I swear I'm going to get it,
Because I'm convinced that giving in is the worst thing there is,

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets,
Let them ferment and came back to our senses,
Drove back home and slept a few days,
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be,

We'll get over it,
Sad, strong, safe, and sober,
We'll move forward,
And know where we went wrong,
But you can't go home again,
You can't go home again,
You can't go home again,
You can't go home again,
You can't go home again!
You can't go home again!
You can't go home again!!!

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets,
Let them ferment and came back to our senses,
Drove back home and slept a few days,
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be.</i>"

"event","Ok I'm a green nut job. More correctly, I'd like to be. I fall short in many ways, least of which is really rather loving nice long hot showers.

All in all though, there are too many things that I want to do, or want to start doing. It looks daunting. In addition to some of the, I'm new to my house and still feel like I'm making it a home thing there are many other things that I would like to do with the house and yard.  

The swing-set must come down. As no one's gotten back on if they'd be able to pick it up and use it, I'm looking at alternative uses for the wood, as it's probably not a good idea to burn the treated wood. Ideas for this range from garden partitioning to benches with planters somewhere in-between. 

The Yard itself is another mater entirely. It's a mess, covered with weeds and a veritable home for grasshoppers and a paradise for mosquitoes.  The plan, because I detest the idea of putting down fertilizer treatment after fertilizer treatment (the majority of ground water pollution, comes not from runoff of chemicals from our roads, but from the chemicals we put onto our lawns) -- the plan is to attack it with a couple of tillers, rake it out and put down fresh sod.  A lot of work? Yes.  More expensive than the other ways? Probably. I've yet to find a way where I don't have the chemicals, and my back yard won't be a mud puddle for 3 or more years.

In putting back down, there would also be plans for garden, vegetable and some flower spots incorporated as well. Flower spots, should read, Lemongrass around some parts of the deck, to act as natural citronella.  Here's to hoping. 

For the front yard there are some things I'd like to change up, and do some lasagna gardening around the front flower beds.  The trees need to be taken care of, as I regularly get guys coming by wanting to trim the dead off of them.  Yes it needs to be done, No, I'm not going to have random joe schmoe do it. I'll research and call to schedule. 

Other than that.  When it comes to the garden I really want to do a vegetable garden. I really want to have herbs growing somewhere either indoor or out,preferably some that I can move in at season changes.  I'd love to start composting and get a rain barrel. I have been told however, I have to have something to use it for first."

I was given Blue:

1. That soft blue shirt of Matt's that he's probably had for the past 10 years and wears every chance he gets
2. Hydrangeas and delphinium
3. Matt's eyes although they have a greenish tint at times
4. The binary ties we got for our groomsmen and how they ended up matching their vests perfectly
5. the bamboo sheets we have on the bed -- so soft!
6. My clay tea mug that's sitting near me at work! 
7. My deep blue black out curtains 
8. how we painted the guest room
9. The blue lady from Kelly
10. those blueish purple pansies!!"

"event","Got some stuff done!

the living room and the guest bedroom are painted and PamPam's bed(my dad's grandfather) is up!  Just need a couple more things and the room will be good to go.

The living room still  needs the piano, and there are a few more changes that I've been looking forward to due to items coming from mom and dads.  -- Things that need to get moved and soon due to Plumbing issues -- Items I was expecting to have this past Sunday but the weather did not agree.


We're starting the Shape up HP challenge at work,  my goal?  be down to 160 by the end of summer. Unfortunately, today I've been having the adverse effect of feeling like an over-sized Giant. . . but that could have something to do with my co-worker who is in from China.  -- of my team I am most definitely the tallest. -- well not including the PM from Poland who isn't here this week.

I did the Pig on Saturday morning -- when I pulled the clothes out to put them in the washer last night they were still soaked.  Looking forward to doing it next year -- maybe I'll be down to 14 minute miles.

Hung out over at Mom's due to trying to get rid of some of the sewing room stuff.  there still is a lot there to go through.  It doesn't look like it was touched and the smallest load. . . hahaha was probably mine!


We are looking at new lawn mowers and possibly going to get an electric cordless mower.  I've been astounded at how horrible that 'small little motor' is when it comes to emissions. -- and no that's not why we are getting a new one, Mom and Dad are offering to buy one for Matt since most of the stuff from the wedding and registry was apparently for me ;)"

"event","When it's noon, and I'm awake already -- getting up at 6 and taking a walk/jog/run/bikeride around the neighborhood before getting ready for work sounds like an awesome idea.  I get excited and go ""I want!""

however at 7 am when I'm hitting the snooze button and grumbling about it being cold outside my covers. . . I obviously don't want.


or in general there seems to be a difference between the things that I want and the things I end up obviously wanting -- by what my actions state- that I want.  I wanted to get work done on some Ikasu stuff last night, but apparently I also wanted to read down in the basement.

Maybe it's motivation.

I mean what is the difference between 6am and 9pm?  what makes 9pm a no.. . I don't think so probably not a good idea- it's dark!  when 6am would be just as dark for the majority of the year?

At Mom and dad's would I have hesitated to take a walk at 9pm-- or even 10? -- it wasn't that generally when dad would take Mitzi(our dog growing up) for a walk?

Is it mainly cause I don't know the neighborhood yet?

I guess I need something to make me get out of bed.  I'm back to roll out of bed, put the clothes on I need and out to the car and down to work.  Which I guess is just who I am cause it's been my style on things for at leas the past 8 years -- but I know it's not necessarily the best."

"event","Ok, so my arch at work has completed, and I do not currently have a new role to move into.  Thus I am 'On the Bench' -- or in my words, employed unemployment.  I have a job, but no work at the moment, or as my manager puts it my job is to find a job -- obviously within the company.  

It may mean doing something different than I am, something other than DBA work.

That's fine that's great.  As I told my manager the other morning, originally I was looking at ITLP positions, where I would be rotated through a series of differnt positions, exposing me to differnt aspects of the business, letting me see what those entail that would not only allow myself and the company to find the right fit, but would allow me to build a diversified foundation. 

I need to find out what I could re-tool into and as.  What other realm of IT that I could do here would be bennificial for the company and help me move on towards my life and career goals.

What are those goals?  What can I get out of the way, state and thus label and move aside so that I can find what I'm doing. and what I need to do?

Life goals:
There are things I want.  and if anything those count as goals or at least milestones:
I want to like my house maybe even love it to make it ours.

I want to throw/host a prom re-do, but I don't know the time or exactally what or who.  I do know that if it goes well I want to see if I can perhaps roll it into a fundraiser for MBCES.

I will be running the Pig for MBCES -- this will hopefully get me into better shape and give me more time with my sister. 

I want to think about Grad school. and get some ducks in order about it.




Work goals:

eventually I want to be a solutions Archetect.  I want to put to use what I learned in Systems Analysis and Design.  I want the majority of my deliverables to be DFD's, ERD's, and pseudo code.  

I need to find a new position, one where it clicks and I fit and I enjoy doing what I'm doing.   I need it to be something I can be passionate about that I'm willing and able to dealve into it and teach it to myself and learn new things about it on my own. 


I need better networking skills, I need to have the self confidence to go forward meet some one and not self depreciate.  To know what my base skills are and to know that YES I am good at these things, I can be good for you too.

Goals for the year:
I'm Ikasu Ops director, I've got quite a few goals pertaining to this year and how I want to interact and how I want to get this pulled off.  This is a time drain, but in the end I think it will be benifficial for me on both a personal and professional level.
The things I like about this position end up being along the lines of the satisfaction of seeing it all come together at con, and the learnings in bringing the people together to do so and making the processes smoother in general as things go. 

Outside Project with friends -- there is a project that some of my friends are getting together to accomplish. It's awesome, and like the Ikasu work, the stuff I do and learn here I feel can only increase my personal, and professional growth.  It too involves a lot of time.


Things I know about myself:
I know that I'm happy when I'm busy -- meaning I have stuff on my to-do list that can be checked off and can directly relate to the customer -- example -- I have to move x tables.  
Not so good about I need to read this manual, and go over this code.
I'm a good student when I'm in classes, and I learn through class interaction, ansering posed questions, confirming my ideas(to the teacher in class) and through being walked through it a few times so that I build not only the competency but the confidence that I know it.

I currently am attempting to build my confidence and my knowledge base currently working through Scot Berkun's the Art of Project management, and Hunt and Thomas' Pragmatic programmer.  Issue being that I've been attempting to read these for the past 3 years.

I'm better with smaller changes, better when I can see the results building. this also goes for problem solving at work, when I can see or believe there is progress I'm more motivated to continue.




I want I want I want:
We need a new heater -- the one we have is as old as the house, and the duct work is part of what is causing the temperature descrepancy in the bedroom. 
We need new windows -- as much as I'd like to do this before the heater the heater is less expensive.  I think the windows too are as old as the house and the house is leaking like a seive.  
I'd like new carpet
I'd like to do something with the bathrooms on the second floor and update increase the plumbing
I'd like to change out part of the fence so that it's not oddly angled and that area of the yard can be used
take down the swing set -- I don't care I don't know how old it is and by the time there are kids old ennough to use it, it's going to be badly in dissuse.
I want new furniture for the living room
I want a better set up for the laundry area
I want new cabnients in the kitchen
I want additional counter space in the kitchen
I want to re-seal the deck in the back -- it should have been done before winter but we got the house a month later than we expected and the weather turned.
I want new clothes 
Matt NEEDS new clothes
Matt wants a new computer -- and to maybe get me a new one as well with the specific purpose being the freind based venture.
We want to put network cables in the walls of the house.
I want to get stuff paid off and get rid of debt -- and in my mind I'm moving too slow on it-- and no nothing would be fast ennough other than a boon that would let me get rid of it all in one lump sum.
I want to be able to be there for my freinds if it is needed ( even if I think it is needed and they don't )
I want to paint the spare bedroom and get that set up.
I want to get the Piano and the Refidgerator over from Mom and Dad's along with the cabnients that they talked about.
I want a new purse
I want a better parking option for work"

"event","Do you remember some of those books you read deep into the night, or curled up in the chair in the living room ignoring the TV. 

The books you checked out of the school library time and time again?

I don't know if it was some fundamental change I had when I was working at MP and had 40% off, but I wanted my library, and I wanted it to be my own that I could pull down a book at anytime and reference it.

I know I also started a while back grabbing some of the books I read as a grade schooler be it for class or on my own to add to my library.  I still want to do that, I still am working on pulling some in.

These are the ones I have:

Witch of Blackbird Pond
Julie of the Wolves
Island of the Blue Dolphins
Call it Courage
Mara daughter of the Nile
Mr Poppers Penguins

I think I got Across Five Aprils for Maria


Here are ones that I would be looking for:
Winter Cottage (family during the depression who ends up holing up in a rich family's summer cottage, low and behold one of the stranglers they take in is the owner and his daughter!)
the Outsiders
The Pigman
My Side of the Mountain
Leo the Late bloomer (ok that one is 1st and 2nd Grade but ah well)

darn it!  I had more swimming around my head when I started this and now I can't think of all of them.
I'm also remembering bits and pieces of some that I can't remember the names of, bits and pieces of the story arch keep coming up and I want to re-read but they were school library books. 


What are some of yours?  What books that you read when you were"

"event","It's not really an overall surprise that we got a cat.  Matt and I had been discussing it for a while and getting a cat was definitely an option. We weren't quite expecting to get one so soon, however my cousin sent me a text about 2 weeks ago wondering if we could give one of his cats a good home. We figured might as well, else knowing us we'd be batting the idea back and forth and nothing would come of it. 

My cousin had a roommate move in with an additional cat.  Which was cool.  Unfortunately this new cat and Leo didn't get along very well(whereas Leo got along perfectly well with the other cats and dog that were there).  When they didn't start settling down the decision was made that Leo would need a new home. 


We welcomed Leo to the house on Wednesday evening, and we have been getting used to each other since.  Leo is still on a daily does of anti-anxiety medication-  that I'm hoping to lower the does of, -- but hopefully it will help him adjust ( he was on it before hand as they were hoping it would help him with the issues with the other cat)

for most of the day Thursday Leo hid under the basement steps ( the bottom step of course) and we couldn't get to him. 4am Friday morning, either the medicine kicked in or he just decided he wanted to -- he was at our door Meowing.  I came out, and ended up petting him at the bottom of the steps then went back to bed only for him to continue ( we wern't originally going to let him in the bedroom),  I picked him up and put him in the basement for the rest of the night.

He spent the Majority of Friday under the couch in the basement. 

6am Saturday Morning although the door was open for him, we got the meow treatment again, this time accompanied by him him walking all over Matt and I. Matt eventually got up and went on a tour of the house with Leo.

Sunday morning, Leo learned that he won't always get that response, and ended up curling up for a while with Matt.

Overall he's getting used to us, and we're getting used to him.  I think he's going to be better than an alarm clock for a while, and that 6am will be wake up time.

He seems friendlier in the evening and in the morning, most of the day itself though he spends under the love seat in the library. 

This morning, he about tripped me down the steps and spent half the morning meowing back and forth at me trying to get me to follow him around, but I was working from home and that wasn't happening."

saw this on wolfdaughters journal and thought might as well. . . 

I am still kicking myself for not seeing Aerosmith and Run DMC together back in . . . 2003? 2004? when they were at Riverbend.. .   Run from Run DMC died about 2 months latter, and it's not something I could see again. 

I missed Aerosmith ( did and didn't they canceled the show and I didn't hear of a reschedule) this summer.

I'm always worried about the cost of the tickets since Aerosmith is so big and generally also has some other big names with them. . . and this year it was right after. . . yes I went to it . . . the NKOTB concert and could only fund 1 at a time -- NKOTB was for nostalgia sake, and to do something awesome with my sister. . . lets just say a lot of things that I didn't understand when I was 5 clicked.. . . 

Also kicking myself for missing the Metalica Concert. .. but afraid of the mobs of people,  I even made sure I left downtown early that day to run away from the traffic I knew it would cause. :(

other than that. . . They Might Be Giants needs to come back into town, or well somewhere in Ohio, I'd drive to see them. Last time they were in town they played at Bogarts during the week of april 17th 2002.  Maria took me to it for my 18th birthday, and OK GO opened for them it was awesome."

"event","So it's been a little while since I posted.

For the most part until the end of last week begining of this there was really nothing new to report.  Things were as they were.

A week ago we signed the new addendum, with the contract changes due to the appraisal not changing. We closed on the house on Tuesday.  Wasting no time we bought paint tuesday evening and started painting last night with some really rather awesome help. We are moving this saturday, and attempting to get everything together.

Work has been ok, I took my Oracle exam. . . I didn't pass.  I've been told by a co-worker, that it's a really difficult exam and that I did well for the score I got.

I've been fighting motivation issues, and connectivity issues with my work machine.  Even now, I can't get into Gmail as it won't load, but I'm here fine.( and yes I realize this is less intensive than Gmails constant refreshes) but it has been a constant battle each morning and throughout the day-- leaving it difficult to look things up for work.

I picked up and am trying to read the Pragmatic Programer.  Maybe it can help me a bit.

I'm pretty sure my sinus issues also have something to do with the air pressure. During the last season change is when I had all the issues with the dizzy spells etc.  Currently I'm having some of the concentration issues, as well as a constant, just at the edges migrane that is worse at night and in the morning. -- I really really have not wanted to get out of bed the past few days and went to bed earlier on Monday evening.  Of course this happens the week we close on the house, and I feel like if I take a day off, I'll feel like people at work would thing 'Yeah right she's sick .. . sure!  she's working on house stuff'  and I would feel bad for 'wasting time' because I'm not doing anything, and not really being able to rest cause my living space is in dissaray."

"event","Maybe I should put out an overall update on what has been going on recently.  in part as I know I use my LJ as a kind of time capsule to look back on thought feeling etc.

Not that this is so much that.  If it were to be that you would have had to have gotten various updates through out the past two weeks that were confused, flustered, frustrated, angry and disappointed.


currently I am blah.

maybe -- I think all those above are there lurking beneath the surface.


about 2 1/2 weeks ago that I was to be moving this weekend hit me like a truck.  I finally got boxes about two weeks ago on Tuesday and started packing that which I could.  -- and for the other items that were going on and that I was packing in two places at once, I think I did pretty good.

Last friday there was friend drama.  That I won't go into as it has been taken care of and things are at a more even- normal keel -- in part due to the other drama happening.

We were supposed to close on Thursday the 27th.  That Tuesday I emailed our Realtor to get set times on when we needed to be where and what our next steps were.  I get an email back Wednesday morning that the Realtor was unsure that we'd be closing on Thursday as he was unable to get a hold of either the title office or the bank.  Latter that day we find out that the issue is with the appraisal being lower than our contracted price and messing things up with the loan.  

When we applied for the loan, we took the contract paperwork we had, which was the carbon copies of the initial offer contract.  It had all the information but did not have the final agreed price, just the initial offer.  I told the banker this and what it had changed to and asked if I needed to get him the other info.  I was told no this was fine.  He even was given the number and card of our realtors.

However apparently part of the issue was that the appraisal was done with the initial offer number not the final contract number. This was not noticed until the day before we were supposed to close.

When the banker went back to the appraiser the appraiser stuck to his guns on it.   The lender after telling me this was to call our Realtor and the selling Realtor.  The Loan officer wanted the seller to come down on price and was overall thinking this is a wonderful thing for Matt and I. 


By Friday this was the situation:
The lender was adamant that we were find on approvals and that we were fine financially to get it, the issue was in the banks mind, the value of the house was not equal to the value of the loan they would be giving us (even though we were approved for more) -- thus we had several routes of action.  We could come up with the difference -- close to 5000 and pay that -- which wasn't recommended, or work something out with the seller to bring down the price.  Either way we needed to work with our Realtor and the selling Realtor on it.  We still hadn't heard from our Realtor.

We found out on Saturday that our Realtor was out of town on vacation over the weekend and that he hadn't had a situation like this before and needed to talk to his boss and get back with us on Sunday.

By this point, I had already hit stress ground zero with one thing or another and got Matt to take point on dealing with the bank and Realtor on issues with the house. 

Sunday, Missy's Bridal shower -- huzzah!  -- the Realtor got back in touch with Matt -- saying that the next avenue was to contest the appraisal as it was widely different than the appraisal the Realtor had done, and that there was question into it's validity as the number it came to surprisingly matched exactly our initial offer. 


Monday, Matt calls and wants to talk to our lenders manager, mainly to find out WHY this didn't get noticed until the day before closing. -- No return call.

Tuesday -- Gah I can't remember what happened on Tuesday,  I know that Matt talked to him, I don't remember what the outcome was other than it was pretty much a no answer of we're still in limbo  and the overall feeling that the Realtors thought it was the banks problem and the Bank thought it was the Realtor's problem to solve all the while Matt and I are wondering if we should continue to pack or not.   We get ennough of a delay in things -- or the way things would be delayed to Cancel packing and Cancel the Move for Saturday.


Wednesday --  the Realtors want us to try a different bank and see if we can get a new appraisal that way as the bank wasn't wanting to budge.  Our Realtor calls the bank and finds out that the appraisal sticks to the house and is attached to it for 120 days and that even if we switched banks, that wouldn't work. 

Thursday:  apparently the Realtors and the bank decided to gang up on the Appraiser, and the Appraiser decided to re-do the appraisal.  -- we won't know more until Tuesday.


Through this whole thing it was a case of the feeling of we'll know something definite in two days and until say Wednesday the bank and the Realtor were giving the impression that we could still possibly close this week.

So right now we are waiting.  Still.  

There are other complexities to the situation, Friends who had offered to help, keeping them abreast of the situation,  Family drama in which the need for the move and a place for things is made all the more important, and the fact that a goodly portion of our stuff is in our living room in boxes. . ."

"event","So we arn't closing on the house tonight like we were supposed to.  There was issue where the apprasier used our offering price when validating the house for the loan as opposed to our final agreed upon on.  And due to new legislation to protect consumers, anytime a change like that happens, there is a mandatory wait of 3 days before it can be closed.  

My main question, that I'm still not 100% clear on is why it was an issue in the first place, and why it wasn't caught earlier? -- I was talking to the loan officer yesterday and basically got that it was caught when things came back through to be viewed etc but it's still frustrating.  So instead of havign this weekend to paint and get things ready at the house, we have an unknown number of weeknights to complete it- as the move is still happening as planned on Saturday the 5th.

List of Things to be done before:

<s>Laundry</s>

<s>Hooking up Mom's Printer -- I got heck for going to the Mammoth Cave area when I don't have time to hook up mom's printer >.< ( I pulled it out and set it on the table the day grandpa passed and didn't really have the brain capacity to do it at that point)</s> -- done by Matt thank the Lord for awesome husbands

On a completely differnt note  my geekiness this morning:

the diet coke  from the vending machine was selection 42
the pop tarts  (from the other machine) 66


so I have both the answer to life the universe and everything. . . diet coke?  and poptarts killed the Jedi. ."

"event","As some of you may know Matt and I have been in the market to buy a house since oohhh. . . November? December?

We believe that search to be (blessedly) over.  On Thursday we put in an offer on a house, countered, re-countered and finally came to an accepted offer. 

There are many things to do. Inspection, Loan application etc, as well as gathering resources, packing and eventually moving. 

I wonder why it is, whenever I'm about to move,  I end up finding all the things I really like about where I am currently living.   Not that I have a huge realm of experience with this.

The space I'm at now is nice.  for just me,  it was perfect, more than perfect (with the small exceptions of not having a garage, and not being able to store stuff)  I'm finding myself wistfully looking out my at my back porch and down to the pond.

I just re-arranged stuff on top of my fridge, and I was debating getting a phot for how awesome it is >.<

I did the same at mom and dads.  -- And frankly. . . I would have loved it if the apartment I had found had the same layout at the second floor of mom and dads. . . just that I was able to use the bedroom.  My apartment is better. . . well cause it has 1.5 baths-- I don't have to share my messy use everyday bathroom with my guests. . . and they don't have to walk through my bedroom to get to it (although had I had the entire second floor that wouldn't have been an issue)

In the past year I've made this apartment home.  I have no doubt that I will convert, and transform the house into a home.  Nor do I doubt that I will enjoy every moment of it-- even my personal release to myself that I can go to yard sales again to look for finds for the house.




The house we are going for is Matt's favorite of the two we were narrowed down to.  Which is cool.  There is a lot less we'd have to do with this house.  It has. . .however less character than the one that I was rooting for. -- I think the perfect house would be a melding of the two.   

I'm worried about the size of the yard. . . . it's not tiny, but it's not well sized either.  It'll work of course but still :)"

Sunday Morning -- Normal stuff with the Ferguson's (yes I realize I am one now to but. . . differentiate!

Breakfast,
Mass,
Lunch 

got home about two and Matt left for the dudgeon and the raid

I spent an hour or so working on Ikasu stuff, and writing up a list that I would need for grocery shopping.

Headed out at 4. .. went Crap! how late is Aldi's open?  Have to go there first!
I only had $40 cash in my wallet so I was excited to keep it under there -- huge bag o groceries for 34$ woot!  I have can goods again!!!

Then hit bed bath and beyond.  There were a couple things I was looking for to help with organization and cleaning in general -- found a shelving unit that I put on top of the frige so the space isn't wasted. . and we can get to everything . .. huzzah!!

Then to biggs for the rest of the grocery shopping. . . 

I get home about 6 and put on dinner while re-organizing the top of the fridge

In between I work on more Ikasu stuff cause I got in contact with my Gaming head :D huzzah!

then the 'fun' part.  -- I cleaned the kitchen.  Really cleaned the kitchen.. . for the most part.

I cleaned the floor -- so far as to pull the stove out and clean underneath it-- as there was just enough space between it and the counter for things to be atrocious.

from there I do my disconnected and jumbled cleaning style on the rest of the apartment.  cleaned both bathrooms, put away my clothes etc sorted matt's for him to put away 

dusted
and vacummed.

rawr. . .  I am super woman  /flex



The living room is still not how I'd like it but I've got lightsabers on the ground, rock band in the corner, blankets that I have no place for but need where they are. . . and my bins for the  controllers and games are still at my parents from having programs in them.


sigh

the vacuming wasn't a full vacuming I didn't move things in it but I'm pretty pleased overall at the moment."

Apparently Gills Onions uses the onion waste(from cutting down the onions for salsa, onion rings etc) smashes them down, ferments them and uses it as methane or some other by product to power the plant.

Mainly cause the hottest parts of the day I'd be at work, there would be a breeze through the house and it was pretty ok with the fans.


so I was confused as to why I was so warm earlier today.  we got an extra fan and the airflow is still pretty good.   I thought maybe it's because there is more stuff in the apartment. . . but that doesn't make sense.  then I got to thinking -- maybe I just wasn't really HOME on a saturday afternoon last summer.


I checked my G.Calendar from last year.  Nope not home much on the weekends at all.  No wonder I didn't really notice it.


Yes I have an airconditioner.  I attempted using it last year.  Found that it was actually cooler in the apartment the windows open and the fans going. ( had it going straight for a week -- ended up with a sinus headache, and an electric bill that was twice the month before -- and at the end of the week opening the windows and it actually cooling off.)  shruggs.

ah well I'll live :)

-- and I didn't get the airconditioner looked at cause well -- even if it did cool things down I was getting by w/o it fine and with lower cost/electric usage -- plus I wasn't expecting to be here this summer.  Ah well :)


I'm a freak I know I adapt better to heat than cold.  I just do it's me. I realize that others don't."

People are over for DnD :) awesome :D

we order Chineese --I get green beans and a small chicken lo Mein

sounds awesome 

well I hear grumblings cause I haven't been able to go grocery shopping in the past. . . ages and have no pepsi or coke (other than diet)  So I figure I can go get a light thing of groceries and be back by the time it gets there

enroute to bigs I get a call -- the chineese place can't find my apartment on the gps.  Basically telling me that the Address that I've lived at for the past YEAR doesn't exist. . .BULL.

they call me back ( different person) latter while I'm in the store I have to Again tell them my address and spell it out for them ( not like I didn't 100 times before hand)

Well it seems to work cause when I get home, I get there the same time as the guy dropping it off is leaving.

I carry everything in myself ( my own doing I could have asked but I didn't)   and we get to diving out the food grab the box that should be my lo mein -- I get around to opening it up -- it's white rice.  No chicken lo Mein -- the woman had repeated back the order correctly to me. 


so not only did I fight with the place to get it here my order was wrong. . . to make matters worse when I put the chicken in the forman to cook I realized ( after it cooked) that it didn't smell right and it was frostbit


Huzzah for white rice and green beans. . .

ALTER TABLE <table_name> MOVE TABLESPACE <tablespace>;   right?

wrong!  this table was a partitioned table.

My work around at the time was to 
1. build a like partitioned table- as a backup
2. copy data to the back up table
3. drop base table
4. rebuild base table in new tablespace
5. copy data to new table
6. drop test table

-- lots of steps and very space, cpu and time consuming.

Earlier this week in editing/ adapting another set of scripts I came across a better way.

1. Alter the table so it's default tablespace is the new tablespace
ALTER TABLE <table_name> MODIFY DEFAULT ATTRIBUTES TABLESPACE <tablespace>;
  this means that any new partition, any new data will be created in that tablespace

2. For each partition / sub partition  move them over to the new tablespace individually.
ALTER TABLE <table_name> MOVE PARTITION <partition_name> TABLESPACE <tablespace>;"

"event","Context's

From the 11g documentation a context is: 
""An application context is a set of name-value pairs that Oracle Database stores in memory. The application context has a label called a namespace, for example, empno_ctx for an application context that retrieves employee IDs. Inside the context are the name-value pairs (an associative array): the name points to a location in memory that holds the value. An application can use the application context to access session information about a user, such as the user ID or other user-specific information, or a client ID, and then securely pass this data to the database. You can then use this information to either permit or prevent the user from accessing data through the application. You can use application contexts to authenticate both database and nondatabase users.""

sadly I'm still not 100% sure what they are used for -- however I do know that --

Contexts are database wide -- there is 1 context set for the DB
to change the context ( say re-create it using a script from a different schema)

you first have to Drop the Context

then run the create statement for the context using the script from the correct schema.


It is important to know that if you had an application that had a specific  context -- when it is replaced -- that original application will be broken -- In today's case it was a matter of changing development stages.

In this case you are overwriting a section of data that is being used/cross referenced 

I know a while back we used a synonym so that it basically fooled the schema into thinking they both had their own context's when really the context was the same.   In today's case well there is something to be said of not opening cans of worms."

From Grandpa's I was to go right over for Easter Dinner at Matt's Parents.  Dinner was good :)  Very full by the end but not full enough not to have some of Michelle's delicious Daffodil Cake. Apparently although I told my parents that April already had too much going on to worry about my birthday -- The Fergusons didn't get that (also my Dad's B-day is two day's before mine, trying to put another day into that is just nuts!)

I've had entire sundays where I've just stayed home, curled up in bed with a splitting sinus migrate where moving makes me that one step below nauseous. 


The worst are the things that are one step below being fully sick 

-- it can my stomach funky -- one step below nauseous -- where your stomach is funky but you don't actively feel like you are about to revisit lunch
 
-- it can make my head wonky -- and this is the worst in a way.  it's one step below dizzy, kinda lightheaded and I can't concentrate on anything. 


currently I'm suffering from head wonky-ness -- the only other sinus pain I'm having is simply a tightness in the sinus' not a full out headache but the precursor to a whopper.  I noticed when it hit this morning that I had to concentrate on walking.  . .  concentrate on WALKING graaahh -  if I had been drinking it would be the point where I'd had the keys over to Matt and tell him he's driving.  



I hate this wonkyness it agrivates me to no end 'cause I can't concentrate on anything!  and I feel like a horrible person taking off of work when it's like this -- even though I can't concentrate on work.  I look perfectly fine, and if it wern't for me feeling a bit almost dizzy and not being able to concentrate I would be fine. . . 

and it all feels like excuse  -- cause well I'm perfectly fine doing other things things that don't require a me having to pay much attention -- there is no reason I can't hang out with friends and find reading for fun ( other than the strain it puts on my eyes and how I might be sitting ) to be no problem.

Things have been going well -- not 100% outstanding but well enough.

wedding stuff is starting to eat my brain --  I keep looking at theknot and other sites and frustratedly looking away -- as I'm past the point where I need to be idly looking at pictures there.  They do noting for me -- as I've got it planned -- at least you know the dresses the favors, the hall the flowers those things.

The things that are in the pictures.

Maybe that's part of the reason why I haven't updated in a while ;)  I start writing and I start rambling about wedding stuff which goes half and half with -- I'm sure you don't wanna hear it and if I tell everybody now -- how are they going to be surprised when they get there?

I've had some marvelous times recently though -- or odd -- or well usual.

A few weeks ( maybe a month?) ago I went driving around with Kelly and Angela -- with the purpose of getting lost.  -- it took me 3 hours to get sufficiently lost that I needed to pull out the GPS . . . by that time -- we'd already gone through Rabbit Hash KY and seen a pig crossing sign. -- and we did the Lion King in 10 minutes :D much fun.

A couple weeks ago -- went driving with Kelly.  . and we both broke out into church songs.  Yes Catholic Mass songs -- possibly off key some words forgotten, and melodies mixed up by time and being used to doing the descant.


Lent has started -- I even went to ash Wednesday mass for the first time in years(school and work generally intervened).  The priest the the church right by work was interesting to say the least.  he came down for the homily and went ""Happy Lent"" and wanted us to respond back to him the same -- even stating ""Common!  I thought we were God's Chosen people, not his Frozen People"" -- that got us to laugh and play along.  His other point was that giving something up for lent was not to deny yourself a joy -- but to rid yourself of something bad.  I remember him saying something about -- so if you like chocolate eat chocolate -- if you have a martini after - or during work and it brings you joy then do it. 

I remember a while back it was something more about doing something more than giving something up. . . but now I'm getting philosophical. . . 


Matt moved in.  If I'm working from home I either end up going out to meet him for lunch or he comes home for lunch.  It works.   I think in part I'm still getting used to it.  I love the time to myself -- but then I always loved when I had the house to myself -- even if I didn't go downstairs.


I'm trying to study for an Oracle Certification that I want to have before the year is up.  It's going ok, but not making the progress I would like. 


Things have been hitting left and right -- but it's not really a big deal:
My sinus' have been acting up
My ankle hurts every once in a while -- and I tripped over a stone on my walkway yesterday and threw it out of wack again  . . pout
and I just got my car back. . for the second time this month -- from the shop because the engine light was on.
I got a perm that took longer than I anticipated -- so I worked over the weekend and had huge ammts of guilt -- and now my hair is all poofy so I go from no body to a ton. . . 

-- in the grand scheme of things -- they are annoying but not really a big deal -- but have kept we working from home -- on some ( sinus and car)


All in all ( despite my whining above)  things are going good.  Looking forward to May but have a lot to do before that as well."

Currently as in tonight. . .  you have fliped. . . . I don't know how many times,  I have lost count.  This is rather annoying because my Refrigerator is on you.  Not funny.

What would be humorous if it weren't so frustrating is other than the refrigerator the light load you are bearing.   I could under stand you tripping -- maybe -- and you haven't in the past  when I had three computers, a printer, speakers and numerous other appliances running on you at the same time and tripped.  I may even thing that it was my fault.  However,  Several times when you tripped tonight the only thing that was on you was the refrigerator.  

The issue with this all being that the maintenance guy will take one look at my computer and believe that IT is what is making you trip.  I know better.  The other issue is you don't do it consistently.  You tripped about 4 times on Saturday night,  but I haven't had an issue again until this evening. . .  Prior to that,  it was a brief spattering or tripping every once in a while after the wind storm.

"event","So some things have changed in the past month Things that I have steadfastly stated NO I am NOT doing in the past that looks like chances are good that I will be doing in the near future. 

I didn't want to buy a house while putting together a wedding and taking care of the like items.  Guess what.  We are now looking at and will be buying a house in the near future.  With the market as it is, it looks as though our monthly mortgage payment along with taxes and insurance may well be within the range we were looking at for rent, or less.  Talked to the bank, we are pre-approved for a loan, all we have to do is find the place.

We will not be rushing the decision, we want to take our time and find the right place for what we are looking for-  be it the next 5 years or the next 30,  two different yet similar sets of criteria for those and both can be within our price range.

Which leads me to the second major crow dish. . . 

This is going to take time.  Time, which with our original plan. . . we don't have.  Matt's lease is up at the end of January, and his complex only does year by year leases. Since it is doubtful that we will close on a house by the end of January. . . Matt's going to be moving in with me.  He will be moving into whatever house we get as soon as it's ready to be moved into and I'll be following after the wedding.  We shall see how things go.  My views on living together before marriage are still pretty much the same.  It is not mandatory for me to live with some one before I marry them to know if I want to spend the rest of my life with them.  I can find that out and learn about it in other ways.  The statistics that I've seen in the past are still against those who live together before marriage. . .however. . . I want to say that is more that you lived together for a while prior, and possibly prior to the engagement. . . I doubt that 4 to 5 months prior to the wedding is what it's talking about >.<  still that's me making excuses.

In this case it makes more sense then sending Matt back to his parents or going for a year lease.  We'll be paying only one rent payment during whatever time he's at my place as opposed to two and can pay some more stuff down. . .

This is not the optimal plan overall. . .but,  for the situation that we are in. . . it appears to be the best fit.

I get home,  I'm playing around online, and stitting with my right leg curled up underneath me -- like I sometimes do.  And as it sometimes does,  my foot fell asleep.

Thinking the best way to get feeling back would be to stand up and walk on it ( what I needed to do anyway) I attempted that.. . as I stood up and took a step -- I about fell over. .  and feeling came back with a crunching sound.  . . -- My ankle.

This time I had enough feeling to know that my foot was flat against the ground. I could put weight on it and it didn't hurt horribly much -- meaning it wasn't excruciating. . 


This is the same ankle that has been attempting to be broken for the past 5 years,  the same one that likes to fold my foot under. . . I've been told that that happening and steping on it ( it happens too fast and while i'm already in the process of stepping. . . sometimes I am able to catch myself, others,  I'm not-- esp when I accidentally step on uneven surfaces which only makes it worse--ex the edge between sidewalk and grass -- that has left my ankle feeling the same way it is currently- and me limping for the next 4-5 days each)  I've been told that since I can walk on it - it's not broken, sprained, or even twisted. . . no these haven't been by doctors. . .


I'm really expecting to one day for it to finally just break, and then it to heal back together correctly. .. . I'm debating going to the doctor about it but it seems like overkill. . . Plus it's my right foot. . . the one I need to drive.  but I'm in a position now where I could possibly do so with work. . . >.<

It's not swollen, I can put weight on it for walking, however I can't sit Indian style or turn my leg so that the outside part of my ankle is down and and even just rest it that way- part of the foot must be tilted up.     

It hurts, but it's not debilitating -- which is pulling at my -- should I go to the doctor and get it taken care of? or just work with it as I have in the past?"

Oi so my sinuses are killing me. . . and sitting in front of the computer probably isn't helping. . nor would reading nor would napping. . . nor would . . . well I can't think of anything that would really help at this point. . .maybe I will try the nap at some point anyway. . . 


In trying to think of what I can do to get away from the computer,  part of me wants to go Shopping. . .but that is a really really bad idea. ..  Part of the shopping is xmas related, the other part is . . .Oh oh oh I want fruit. . aww man we are out of pop. ..  ice cream?  what can I munch on?  pout. . .

I'm having a major does fo cabin fever right now. .. and I'm not sure why. . ."

"event","So I've been on a sims kick recently. . . I've been playing sims while Matt has been leveling Menath on wow. .. 

I've gone from 8 houses in my main neighborhood to 10, and finally gotten enough teens to the point where I moved them to university.

started in university again last night.  Just the Luke, Han, Mara, Leia house.

I feel like I'm playing a few of the houses on easy mode.  Especially that University house.

Ok, so Han, Leia, and Luke I started all of them from kids (Luke and Leia may have been todlers)  either way they had plenty of time to gain skill points, and my original goal was to have them have 3 skill points in each of the skills ( cooking, mechanical, charisma, cleaning, body, creativity and logic)   well for the most part they had an average of 5 with some sevens and some threes.  Free time as much as they say it makes the game harder,  pulls in a whole range of items that help them build skills that are also fun. . . 

the house where Han grew up, was him, Chewie and the 'Broke' family that I moved in as a spouse and other kids for Chewie. . . I've got at least three virtuosos out of that family.  Meaning that their favorite activity is Music and Dance, and they've maxed out their enthusiasm for it. And want to do it all the time.  Han included. -- which kinda made me sad that his wasn't tinkering. . . poo


Mara started off in University last night.  I played for like 4 hours. . . but I have an ungodly ammount of skill points for only that 4 hours.  Last count I had for her was 24 skills that three in each skill, plus 3 additional in creativity.  This is in addition to the 4.0 that she and the other three in the house have been keeping.


Ok, I will give you, that I have been 'sending' things with the teens as they go to college. Putting things in their inventory, and these also had scholarships. however Han was really the only one who brought much.  I've made the house much bigger, they have high level beds, couches and chairs. ..  their house is outfitted now as well if not better than some of the ones in the main neighborhood.

I've also had a bit of a 'business' going.  Luke has a love for arts and crafts, and his paintings which makes him happy to do, are now selling in the 200 simoleon range, also there is this wonderful thing called restoring old cars.  You buy a broken down car for 800 simolenons, you work on the engine, the body, and paint it.  It then sells for 5200 simoleons.   within their frosh year. . . possibly just the second sememster cause that's when I got the funds to be able to add the driveway -- they restored 3 cars. . . it gives them money, tinkering, and mechanical. . . 

it's kinda ridiculous and I know the other house next door is not going to be as easy. . . especially as it has the 'Pleasant' twins. . . who hate each other. . ."

"event","I guess I'll weigh in on the whole election thing. . . 


Growing up I remember bits and pieces of elections, and dad coming home, we made sure we had a quick dinner so he could go vote after work.  The same as for holy day's of obligation so that we could make it to 7pm mass.  Mom would get charged up about some things, and make her opinion heard.  I remember being vaguely surprised that Mom's first presidential election was the Gore/Bush one.  She was so heated up about Bush's comments in debates, and so sick of things going on between the parties that she wanted to make her voice heard outside of the living room.

I remember dad, when asked who he was voting for or how he was voting, say that it was a personal decision, and between him and his ballot.  maybe not in those words, but those were the meaning.  Although I've heard him several times nod exasperatedly in the direction of mom ( when she was out of ear shot and sight of course -- especially recently) and go ""How do you think I'm voting"" 

Regardless of my mom's ire at the dirty politics, our family has been 'independant'  meaning that we did not automatically side with one side or another. It appears now that my central family's 'independant' means I will listen to both sides equally,  I will not throw my support in and join either party -- regardless how much I like or dislike a particular party.


In my mind,  my view has been. .. Platforms change.  I am (for) whatever platform/canidate that most closely shows my views on certain issues.  I can agree with both canidates, or believe that both are off their rockers.  

I work and live in environments where I am unsure of the political standings, and know that where I may hold a belief,  that my sources may be biased, that I have never done as much research as I would like ( and research means what does this person stand for, what is their record, what do they say they want to do -- not necessarily what the media and the scandal mongers call research)  Thus, I am often without enough information to hold my own in discussions about who what and when -- when it comes to the elections and many times, about other issues as well.  Often I am unsure of where I stand on an issue and have to figure that out myself.

My views and beliefs may not, and from what I've seen and heard, are not the same as many of those I associate with on a daily basis.  I have heard, and understand their view points.  I know that the recent election did not necessarily go the way they had hoped.  My relief at the way the election went, does not mean that I am necessarily joyous.  

Can the President Elect do all he promised?  Is anything of his platform do able? Will things change in any way that will effect me?


As I was growing older, the past three elections stand out in my mind as each being increasingly prevalent in my daily life, and each side seems more and more diametrically opposed. It was black and white and if you were on the other side, you were the cause for all the woes.  

I do realize that both camps were ravenous for this victory, and people were deeply entrenched with beliefs on both sides.  I'm glad that it was not a close as close a race as in the past.  I'm glad it didn't come down to one state and hanging chads. My only hope is that we can set aside our dislike, and work together to get things done."

"event","So they seem to think I'm doing fine at work, but that the only issue that is kinda making me not ready to be 100% on Oct. 1st is Confidence.  

I'm not confident in myself or my abilities.  I know why, I'm just not sure how to fix it.

part of the reason is that I still feel new, and that the sheer amount of things I still need to know is a little overwhelming.  But the guy I'm training under has 8 years of experience on me, and I'm not going to be able to deliver at his level until I have that under my belt.  

We talked about some of it, and he's giving me small code assignments that will hopefully help build my confidence and ability in coding.  

I know I've had some overall setbacks in my own confidence,  I'm not sure how to recover it or if it was even ever really there.  I've had it pointed out previously that I have trust issues to the extent that it appears that I don't even trust my own perceptions or judgement on things >.<"

"event","Today I went on a cave tour in the mountains nearby.  Me, Janet, and Sean went up to <a href=""http://www.caverntours.com/BoydenRt.htm"">Boyden Cave</a> which is near Fresno on Hwy 180 going towards Sequoia National Park.  The drive itself is a nice scenic view once u get into the mountains.  The road winds and curves up the sides of the jutting mountains.  Leaving the hot valley you feel the coolness of the mountain air and the serenity of the mountains.  It cost $20 bucks for each vehicle to get into the park.  

We stopped at the visitor's center to check out the shops and make a pit-stop.  It's like your typical tourist trap.  Janet picked up some blackberry gummy bear candy and we munch those down pretty fast...hehe.  Hopefully I can find some here in town.  It took another 40 minutes to get to the entrance of the cave.  It was getting to be mid afternoon and we had a little bit of time before the next tour started.  Next to the entrance of the cave is a river which had a nice calming effect sitting nearby.

When it was time to start the tour, we had to walk up this steep, i mean steep walkway towards the entrance.  Thankfully, I've been exercising on a regular basis and that helped some.  But we all agreed that it was a though climb and that hearts felt like they were going to explode. hehe.  Once everyone got up that trail, the guide gave us a brief history of the cave and the obligatory safety briefing.  It was an easy tour that was well lit.  You still had to duck and squat here and there along the path but it was still fun to do.  Luckily, there wasn't any water running in the cave or else we would have had to cut the tour short, the creek bed was dry and that allowed up to move further deep in the cave. At the last spot in the cave, we were told that it was so deep that no natural light gets that far and when the guide turned out the lights, it was so pitch black.  You couldn't even see your hand in front of your face.  I think the best part of the tour was when everyone had the option of taking the ""adventurous"" way back or the way we came.  Of course, I wanted to do that. I've always thought it would be fun to explore caves like the experts.  The other path going back was a little more difficult to traverse, alot more ducking, squatting, squeezing to get through some of the small entrances, but it was alot more fun. :)

Before we left the park, we decided to go take a look at some of the older redwoods in the park.  We saw the General Grant tree which is suppose to be the 3rd biggest in the world(?).  It was impressive to look at, as where the other redwood trees.  Just knowing that some of those trees are thousands of years old is mind blowing.  It makes you really appreciate mother nature and this planet.

So our fun filled cave adventure was topped off with dinner at a Thai restaurant that I thought had just opened up.  In fact it had been open for months now.  The food was pretty good, although I didn't think their spicy dishes where spicy enough.  It's hard to find decent asian food in a small town like this, so I'm glad we ate there.  The best part of the meal was the desserts.  The Rambutan was good, even though Janet and Sean didn't care for it.  I guess it's more of an acquired taste.  The coconut ice-cream was very delicious.  The owner said he had to have that imported, which is kinda surprising that he didn't charge more for it.  And the mango with sticky rice was not bad.  The mango was very good and surprised since I imagine it would be hard to get good mango in this area.  I will definitely have to go back and eat there again."

She had her friends from church and her family there to help her celebrate.  The food was good and the weather was nice.  As usual, all my cousins lectured me about how to live my life.  Of course they say it in such a way that it seems like it's just a conversation, but I know they are lecturing.  Just because I'm not married and don't have kids, they seem to take it upon themselves to tell me how to live.  It would be nice to not get the lecture's for once.  Oh well, that's family for you: especially asian families. hehe"

"event","I ended up getting the job at the insurance call center.  I didn't think I was going to get it, but finally got a call.  So I got hired, but as a temp for a few months.  I only have to do 2 weeks of training instead of the 7 weeks for the direct hire folks.  So mainly, I'll be answering phone calls from people asking about their benefits and eligibility status of their dental benefits.  I've heard alot of bad things about this company from alot of different people, but it doesn't seem so bad.  It's definitely going to be repetative but at least the pay is decent and the hours are good.  With the better pay, I should be able to get my own apartment again. I can't wait :)

Have been trying to work out more.  Now that I have steady work hours I'm able to go to the gym.  It's exhausting at times, but since I'm at a job sitting on my butt for 8 hours a day, it'll be real easy to gain a lot of weight.  I ran into an old childhood friend for the second time tonight.  Janette and I use to play together as children.  Our moms knew each other and we'd be over one another's house when our mom's would visit.  It must be about 20 some odd years since I last saw her and her brother.  I was shocked that she recognized me at the gym.  Well, for not seeing anyone in a long time, it's real easy to forget what they look like.  It's nice to run into old friends, and i'm hoping we'll be able to get together one of these days and catch up."

"event","It's so hot right now...it's after 11pm and it should be cool, but it's not.  This summer is gonna really suck.  I can tell already.  :(

Watched the season finale for Survivor:Fiji last night.  I was surprised that my favorite player for this season got screwed.  I was hoping that Yau-Man would have made it to the final 3, but he made a deal with another player (Dreamz), who went back on his word.  Granted, it's a game and everyone is vying for a million-dollar prize but what Dreamz did was so underhanded.  I believe he made that deal in good faith, and only changed his mind at the last minute because he wanted the money more than his integrity.  Yau-Man was the best player on the show.  He came along way for a 54 year old guy and would have probably won if he didn't get backstab.  

It looks like I probably didn't get that job at the insurance call center.  Still haven't received word from the temp agency that does the hiring.  I had call last week and the lady said ""Oh, I believe they made their selection, but I haven't gotten in touch with them yet"".  Or something along those lines.  Well, it's been over a week since the interview and no phone calls.  If I didn't get hired, I would hope at least the temp agency would tell me.  C'mon, I'm not a child, I can take the news if it's bad. :p"

"event","Crazy stuff going on at work.  The manager was recently fired.  It wasn't a big surprise, since she really wasn't doing her job.  Plus, there have been numerous complaints about her from a lot of people since she started working.  It got to the point where it seemed nothing was going to happen to her, and a couple of weeks ago she was ordered to the regional manager's office in New Mexico.  However, she blew off the appointment and it promt-ed the regional manager and one of the V.P.'s from the company to come out and pay a visit.  She was then let go that day.  

Everything changed for the better right off the bat.  But, the boss's where discovered that a lot of money was missing from the station.  It seems that the manager never made a deposit and now a lot of the cash that was taken during ticket sales has turned up missing.  They ended up calling the cops  to make a report, and I believe they are gonna press charges against the former manager.  Which is the way it should go down, because embezzelment is embezzelment.  Yet, what bugs me is that now everyone is gonna be under suspicion.  And what's to stop her from saying everyone else was stealing also?  I know that I didn't take any money, but the perception is there that...""well, maybe they did or maybe they didn't.""  It still amazes me the amount of drama coming out my small workplace.  How can 4-6 people create so much drama?? haha."

As I mentioned before, we all went to Olive Garden.  Janet, Sean, Chris, John, Adam, and Eric all joined me in what was a terific dinner.  The company is what really made it so much fun.  Although with some people it's hard to tell since they're so quiet.  I ended up paying for everyone's dinner.  I've done that in the past, and it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.  I wonder though how people perceive me for doing it though.  I feel like since I've invited them all out to celebrate with me, I want to pay.  I ate so much...lots of food, wine, and desert.  I feel like whatever I worked off in the gym I just gained it all back. haha.  I'm gonna have to work out even harder tomorrow. :p  

It seems my friend doesn't think the mark on my arm is anything but a burn mark.  It's not a burn mark, that I know for sure.  If you burn yourself, you'll know right?  Eh, maybe there is a logical explanation for this mark.  I just thought it was weird that I know someone else who had something similar.  I was told I was just branded by the aliens..haha.  Great, so that makes me like cattle. :p  Hopefully, I'll give the aliens indigestion. haha."

I'm so ready to do something different.  I did interview last week with another company, so I'm hoping that'll pan out.  Not because I really want to do this new job, but because it's a change and I really need a change for my work.

Oh, I noticed this weird mark on my forearm that appeared about a week ago.  It's looks like a scar, but I didn't do anything to damage myself.  One of my friends has a similar scar and feels that it's a mark made by an alien visitation.  Hey, it's very possible.  I believe in aliens and that people are visited by them.  I've never seen one (that I can remember, they can erase people's memories right?) though, but I can't explain the mark on my arm.  It's faded somewhat, but it's just unusual that it appeared all-of-sudden.

Well, tomorrow is my bday.  Another one comes and goes, hehe.  Probably will get some friends together for dinner.  Am planning on having the dinner at Olive Garden.  Haven't been there in a long time, and this is a good excuse as any to eat there. hehe."

"event","Man, I'm feeling weird today.  I dun know what's going on, but emotionally I just feel...out of sync.  Maybe it's cuz friends around me have been feeling down.  I always try to keep up a positive vibe and hope that'll rub off on others, but for some reason today has just been one of those days.  Maybe it's the freaky weather we've been having lately.

Yesterday, my boss got fired from her job.  It's not a surprise really, cuz stuff wasn't getting done and she was kinda abusing her position.  Lots of people have been complaining about her from the start.  It's probably for the best.  She just wasn't management material really.  It was her first management job and I don't think she ever took it seriously.  Then management told her to come to the corporate offices for a meeting and she blew them off and didn't go.  How can you blow off a meeting like that, especially being a manager?  I'm getting burnt out at the job, and have been applying at other places.  

Speaking of which, I had an interview today and I think it went well.  It's not a job that I think I'll enjoy alot but the pay is good and that'll be a blessing.  I really want to get my own place and I definitely need a new car...haha."

The new job will pay a lot more that will allow me to get my own place, a car (which I want so badly, hehe), and the means to do the things I want to do.  I'm just getting tired of the airport job.  The pay is low and the job is starting to suck alot.  I don't even want to go to work anymore.  This new job will give me a chance to do all that since it'll be a significant jump in pay.

Have been spending a lot of time hanging out with friends now.  It's fun meeting new people, especially if you click with them right off the bat.  Like I have with someone I recently met.  Sometimes I get in such a routine I forget that life is really meant to be enjoyed.  I remember going out all the time in Honolulu with my friends from school, the fencing club, and others I met there.  Just being in a social group does help relieve the boredom and dullness that like can get like.  Life is too short to just waste away at home alone.  

Next week is my birthday and am thinking of going out with friends to dinner.  I normally don't do anything for my birthday since I hate being reminded of how much older I'm getting, but I've been in such a ""going-out"" mood that I want to celebrate it this year.  Not gonna go out and get drunk or anything but it'll be nice to get out.  Hopefully, people will be free to join me. :)"

"event","Wow, can't believe how much I've been slacking on LJ.  I use to post stuff often when I first started it.  But lately I haven't really said much.  It's probably because for the past 3 to 4 months I had been working 6 day weeks, and some weeks I worked all 7 days.  I would get so exhausted that I didn't do much but some online gaming and go back to work.  It's calmed down somewhat and I'm back to a 5 day work week.  I do admit I really like the checks from all the overtime, but working all of those hours really put a lot of stress on me mentally and physically.  I think I'm at that age where I value my time off more than I do the money.  I should just switch jobs, the airline business constantly has it's ups and downs that a flight schedule is nothing more than a guideline. 

Maybe what will get me going on posting more on LJ would be to start fresh, make a new account.  Hmmm...that just might do the trick.  Will have to give it more though."

Unfortunately, I don't have any plans except work.  Not much going on, and most of my friends don't have any plans.  Sucks too that I don't get paid until tomorrow. :/

Hmm, let's update since it has been awhile since my last post.  The house is up for sale.  Time for us to move.  My mom wants to move down to Orange County, and me being poor at the moment. :( I'll have to move also since I am unable to afford a place of my own.  Housing market is slow, so not sure when the house will sell.  It's been a month and a half since it was put on the market.  

Will be getting a new job soon.  Well, not entirely new since I'll still be at the airport.  My current company Scenic Airlines is leaving town and Mesa Airlines is taking over the routes.  I got hired on with the new company *yah* but unfortunately I'll be taking a 50 cents and hour pay cut.  Doesn't sound like a lot but it matters when I'm only making $8.50/hr now.  The good thing though, Mesa is big so I can transfer to almost anywhere, and when I move I won't have to look for a new job.  

Also, would like to mention that my friend Apple's birthday was on the 28th.  Happy birthday Apple!  I forgot to mention all of the b'day's in September here, so happy late b-day's to all of my friends that had b-day's in Sept.  :)

"event","Hard to believe it's been 5 years since the World Trade Center attack.  It's definitely one of those events where you remember exactly where u were and what you were doing when it happened.  I was living in Honolulu and I slept in late that day, the night before I was up late, and before going to bed, I opened my closet and noticed a shirt in the corner all bunched up.  I remember looking at it, and thinking it looked like a skull, and thought that was weird.  What does this have to do with 9/11?  Nothing really, just something that sticks in my memory.

Then the next morning, more like late morning, I got up and was was milling about.  On the dry erase board on the fridge, my roommate had written turn on the t.v. now.  I went back to my room (without really questioning it, like I knew for some reason it was important to do it)and turned it on.  The image I saw was the tower falling down. I don't remember if it was the first or second one.  At first I didn't realize what was happening, it looked like something out of a movie.  They kept repeating it, so it didn't take long to realize it was real.  

That same day the FAA grounded all flights.  That went on for 3 days.  I tell you, I never felt more isolated in my life.  Yeah, ships where still running, but living on a island thousands of miles from the mainland (or any major land mass for that matter), flying is really the only way to go.  The ships are mainly for cargo.  Knowing you can't get off the island really hit home the feeling of isolation.  No one knew how long that no flying rule was going to last.  

I didn't get on a plane again until december of that year.  Let me say, it was a nervous feeling taking the first flight after 9/11."

Since she got married last year, I'm sure they planned something special.  Hope everything is going well with the marriage.

As for the computer.  The old one was...well, old.  Five years old that is, and in computer years, that's old. hehe.  I got me a new emachine (model T6534 for those who may want to know).  It's fast (2.2Ghz), lots of hard drive space (200GB), and a DVD burner.  Only 512mb of RAM, but I can always get more later.  It cost around $500 which isn't so bad.  It was worth it, since it's nice to have a computer that works. hehe.

Work is going ok.  Still uncertain about who the new airline is going to replace Scenic.  It'll probably be Great Lakes.  However, Mesa and Big Sky also have bids in.  Any one of them will be a much better company.  They are bigger and have more resources, and hopefully that will translate into better benefits and pay for employees.  Speaking of jobs, next week I have my medical exam in San Francisco.  I think I'll do fine.  I'm in decent shape and nothing medically wrong with me.

This heat wave over the country sucks.  It may ""cool"" down to the low 100's (F) by the end of the week.  I think it's worse living in the central valley.

Went to my appointment today to meet with the psychologist.  After taking the written psych portion 2 weeks ago, I had to meet with this doctor.  It went fast, about 20 minutes or so.  He had a few basic questions about my background, why I want to work for them, etc. etc.  Stuff I had gone over previously with the polygraph examiner and my background investigator.  I didn't mind answering those questions again, and he was really cool.  I think I did allright, not sure if it was a good thing or bad thing for the appointment to be so quick but it's done now.

This past Saturday I went up to San Francisco.  Had to take the written psychological test for the SFPD.  There were three separate tests with about 300 to 400 questions each.  It was all scan-tron: fill in the blank exams, but 4 hours worth of writing and my hand was developing cramps.  The exams weren't hard themselves, but just so tiring.  Especially since I left at 4am to get there by 8am.  The police academy is in the hills of the city (Diamond Heights).  In the morning it was foggy that I almost missed the building.  Now I have to go back next week and talk to the psychologist about my results.  Hopefully everything will go well.  It should, because I'm not crazy. :p  Then I'm off again on August 15th for the medical exam.  That should be the last hoop to jump through.  If I pass these two things then I'll get on the hiring list.  Hopefully I can get hired and attend the October academy class.  It's 7 months long and I just want to get it over with as fast as I can. :)"

As mature as he is, and being Captain of the French team, he should know better.  It's sad that this will be his legacy.  Everyone's going to remember this incident and not his career.  

Also been hitting the gym on a regular basis since last week.  I've also been watching my diet too, and it's paying off: lost 5 pounds in one week. Woohoo. :)  If I can keep this up for the next 3 weeks, I'll be happy."

Had been going to the gym on a regular basis.  Well, since the first.  But I'm keeping up with it.  I'm happy to be working out again.  I missed it a lot and hadn't worked out in years.  A big thing to keeping in shape is one's diet.  I've been really trying to watch what I eat, and we'll see how much of a difference it'll make in a month. :)

The Fourth of July went ok.  Went to watch some fireworks in town with John.  For a small town like this, it wasn't that bad.  I always liked the show Honolulu put on.  It was always over the harbour, and everyone would just go to the Aloha Tower Market Place to sit/stand and watch the show.  The only downfall was that they never changed the show.  It was the same show every year.  I think the best fireworks show I ever saw was in Roswell NM.  For a small town, they really knew how to put on a show, and it went on for a long time.  

Had gotten my mom's A/C fixed in her car.  She thought it was too much, but $261.80 isn't that much.  The part itself was $150, and it's pretty much worth it to have it since it's hell to drive around in this heat without the A/C.  Luckily, it wasn't that hot today.

Also, SFPD called and I have to go back up there on the 15th for a group psych exam.  It pretty much means that they'll be testing many people on the same day.  I was told to expect to be there for 5 to 7 hours.  Crap, that's going to be a long day.  Especially when I have to be there by 8am and I'll be leaving my house by 4am to get there in time.  But, that's what I have to do to get this job."

Everything's going up yet wages are still staying the same or getting lower.  I think I've ranted about this previously.  But it's something that I am always stressing, especially when I had to pay almost 50 bucks to fill up my moms car.  A little here and little there adds up quickly now.  It's getting to the point where I really am considering getting a part-time job just to increase my income.  Rather not, since I like having days off.

I joined a gym yesterday.  I really need to get back into shape.  I've gotten lazy over the winter and put on a few pounds. :D  In-Shape (the name of the gym) had a special going on and I only had to pay $54 to sign up.  No processing or enrollment fee, just a $10 fee for the membership card.  The only thing is that it's $44 a month and that's a bit steep.  However, it'll be money well spent.  I'd probably spend that money on junk anyways.

It's the 4th of July weekend.  No plans really, might just hang out with friends.  Well, I'm definitely going to the gym.  Got to start getting my $44 worth. :)"

If anyplace in California stays cool during the summer it's San Fransisco and the surrounding area.  So is this a product of global warming?  It's very possible.

The weekend went by pretty fast.  Had Saturday off and went to the Blues and Brews fest at the Oaks ball park.  Went to it last year and had a good time.  This year was $10 more, so the admission price was $35.  A bit steep but worth it.  They had live music and different booths from different breweries.  So you could sample any kind of alcohol from any booth.  I didn't drink much at all.  Not really much of a drinker, but my friends drank and we all had a good time.  Since there isn't much going on in this town, it was nice to go to a decent activity.

Can't believe it's almost the 4th of July.  It's on a Tuesday this year.  Hopefully, the neighbors are not going to launch any fireworks.  They tend to make a big mess in our yard and they never clean up.  I'll have to work that day, and hopefully there won't be any delays.  Seems like it's not going to stop soon.  Ever since Scenic decided to get out of the schedule service business, it's like they don't really care about keeping the schedule anymore.  I hope the new airline will be much better."

And it should've been at least 20 degrees less.  I'm sure it was just as hot here in the Central Valley.  First day of summer and man, it sure came with a bang.

Went and did my polygraph exam today.  Didn't take as long as I thought.  Had to go over questions with the examiner about my background.  Afterwards, I was strapped to a machine (the ""lie detector"").  One strap across the chest and another across my stomach.  That one to monitor my breathing.  Then two attachments on my fingers to monitor of all things, my sweat.  Or the moisture really coming out of my pores.  I guess if you aren't telling the truth you tend to sweat more.  However, it was so hot in the office,and I was wearing a suit, I was definetly sweating. hehe.

It was just like in the movies...answer yes or no.  Even though I knew I was taking this exam today, it still felt strange and weird.  I don't have anything to hide, but being hooked up to one of those machines can make anyone a bit nervous. :)  He said I did pretty good, so if I pass this portion, then just a few more things and I'll be hired on the department.  But, I hope I don't have to go up there again for at least a few weeks.  I'm tired of driving up there (only 2 weeks in a row).  And especially since it's one of my days off. :D

She's part of the first graduating class for the new high school (called El Diamante-Diamond in Spanish) in town.  Nice school, and nearby.  Too bad it wasn't around when I was going to high school.  I could have just walk to school and back.  Almost 2 weeks ago, Jane moved down to Fullerton.  She's going to attend a junior college down there.  I'm sad that she moved away, since she had been living here for 3 years.  But, it's better for her.  There's more opportunity there (in Orange County) in terms of school, jobs, and meeting people.  Visalia is just too small to offer much.  So good luck to her, and hopefully it'll be a fun adventure for her.

SFPD called me recently, and I had to travel up to the city to meet with my background investigator.  I had to fill out a bunch of paperwork and had to answer a lot of questions.  The department is going to start my background check and when everything checks out then I'll move into the next process.  This Wednesday, I have to drive to Millbrae to take a polygraph exam (or more commonly known as a lie detector).  It'll be weird really, since I've never taken one before.  In my opinion, they aren't really that reliable or accurate, but that's the norm if you want to get a job with the police department.  I'm not worried about my past, but I hope the machine doesn't get a false reading and they disqualify me for something they shouldn't.

If I get hired soon (possibility by October) I might not move out and get an apartment yet.  I was planning to move to my own apartment (a studio or 1 bedroom) this summer, but i would hate to do that and have to move again a couple of months later.  Need to get back in shape too.  I'm planning to buy a bike this week.  It'll be a bit pricey but I don't want a cheap bike from Target or some other big retail store.  I want to join a gym too, but that costs money; and it's not cheap.  Everything is so expensive now, but wages are still the same.  It sucks that people have to spend more, but aren't getting paid more to compensate.  Oh well, so is life.  If I get this job, then I'll be making decent money.  But living in San Francisco might just suck it all away. hehe."

I've started to look around for apartments.  Probably will have to move out soon when my mom sells the house in a few months.  Their expensive even for a small town like Visalia.  The real nice ones are running around $700/month.  Way too much for what I'm making.  So, I'll more than likely have to look for an apartment that's not so nice looking and in a ""seedy"" part of town.  All though, I doubt it'll ever top my experience living in Section 8 housing in Honolulu.  It was cheap! but man, a lot of the residents were scary people. 

Lots of drama at work now.  I still can't understand how an office of 4 workers can have so much drama.  But it's finally dying down.  And hopefully, I'll be getting a raise since I past my 6 month mark recently.  Yeah, I know it's a long shot.  But I'm keeping my fingers crossed. :)

Also threw my back out again.  I think it was from a lack of exercise and bad eating habits.  I'm starting to walk a lot more (especially since I don't have a car either) and not drink a lot of sodas.  It's so easy at work to snack.  But I'm trying to control my snacking habits.  I think I've dropped 5 pounds in the last two weeks.  Need to lose a lot more though. :p"

First things first, have to mention about a good friend of mine that got married recently.  I think she got married last year, but I didn't find out until early Jan.  Actually, I had the biggest crush on her back in school.  Even though things didn't work out the way I would have liked, I still want to wish her a big congrats on her marriage.

New guy at work still not catching on.   He's been there a month, and still can't use the computer to save his life.  It's like he just started.  The boss wants him to do well, so we have to push him even harder.  I think the company should cut it's losses and hire someone else who is more competent.  I like the guy, but hiring someone who has no computer experience just doesn't cut it in today's world.  He needs to go, but since he's a good friend of the boss's husband, I don't see that happening anytime soon.  

It'll be 6 months at my job on the 22nd.  Hopefully, I'll be getting a raise.  But the company doesn't have any written policy about raises and such.  Or I should say, none that are available to employees.  Will just have to wait and see."

Except this summer the temp will reach into the 100's (which it never did in Hawaii).  I hope with all of this warm weather, this won't mean a really hot summer this year.

It seemed I was passed up for promotion at work.  The supervisor position was open and I and a co-worker were in the running.  Out of the two of us, I am the most senior person there (by 3 to 4 weeks), was the only full-time employee, and I know more about the job than the other person.  However, he ended up getting the promotion over me.  The boss talked to both of us and gave me some lame excuse why I didn't get it.  I feel that favoritism came into play since the other guy was very good friends with the last supervisor.  And the boss really loved the last supervisor.  I'm sure there was some string pulling going on.  I am dissapointed somewhat, but I know this isn't my career so it isn't bothering me that much.

Still without a car.  But, I rarely go anywhere (mainly to work) so I'm not missing having a car.  In fact, it's saving me some money since I don't have to budget money for a car.  Maybe after a few months I'll feel different. :D"

"event","A little slow in getting my blog entries in since the holidays.  I wasn't that busy, but a lot has happened.

First off, my car isn't drivable anymore.  On Saturday the 1st, I was driving around in my Honda, and it just died in the middle of traffic.  Luckily, someone pulled over to help me push the car off the road.  Even though my niece Jane was with me, she's only like 110 lbs.  She did what she could but luckily another guy help me push the car out of traffic and into the nearest parking lot.  

At first I thought it might have been the battery.  I called up my friend John to take me over to Pep Boys so I could test the battery.  Found out it was a bad battery.  With new battery in hand, we went back to my car and tried it again.  Even with a jump the car still wouldn't start.  Crap, so it was more damage than I was hoping for.  Since it was the weekend, the mechanic I usually go to wasn't open.  But I towed it to his parking lot anyways, and waited till Monday to roll around.  

Later that Monday, he called and told me that the timing chain broke.  Also, 9 times out of 10 that if the timing chain breaks, then usually a valve or two is damaged.  The repairs are more than what the car is worth.  A new timing assembly is around $600. and if the valves need replacing, then it'll be another $2,000 bucks to fix that.  There's a slight chance that the valves are ok, but I don't want to spend $600 to fix the timing and find out that I have to get the valves fixed also.  Now the car just sits in my garage until I figure out what to do with it.

I'm stuck using my moms car for awhile.  I plan to get a bike soon.  Yeah, that's right, a bicycle.  I need something right now just to get around town in.  And it's really not that bad an idea, since it's a good way to get some exercise.  It's going to take me a few months to save up some money to buy a new vehicle.  

I don't want to buy a brand new car right now.  Only because I don't want to be making payments on it.  If I was making a little bit more money, It might be more feasible.  However, I have always wanted to get a motorcycle.  Maybe this is a good time to buy one.  They are cheaper than cars, use less gas, insurance is less, and easier to find parking.  :D  

But nothing isn't going to happen until I save up some money first.  Hopefully, I'll get a big refund this year. hehe."

After calculating the hours of the employees, the only way we could be over is if you factor in all the overtime.  However, that's due to plane maintenance delaying the flights.  So it's not the employees fault.  You would think the company would eat that and not ""punish"" the workers since we have no control over that.  

Well, even though I'm a full-time employee, I'm down to 31 hours a week.  This really sucks, since it's right before Christmas.  And Scenic Air raised their fare's by $10.  Maybe this is their way of making more money...raise the fare's and pay the workers less. :p  Hopefully, I'll get my hours back after the 1st."

But it sucks being home all the time and I was climbing the walls!  Then I remembered that a new airline (Scenic Airlines) was starting up in Visalia.  I thought I'd give it a shot and check their website.  Sure enough, they were hiring for a part-time position.  Weird that they didn't advertise it in the local paper.  I interviewed very fast after submitting my application and within a few days I got hired.  Never worked for an airline before but it's a customer service position so I do have experience in that.  My first day of work was yesterday and it was fun.  Only two flights a day from the airport so not much work to do.  It's really a hands-on job.

"event","Back on the 12th I had another exam with SFPD.  This time it was the physical agility test.  Basically, it's running around a small obstacle course, ducking under bars, hoping over a small fence, dragging a 140 pound dummy 25 feet.  I spent the night before in Millbrae because the hotels are too expensive in San Francisco.  Millbrae is like a 15 to 20 minute drive from the city and only cost me 90 bucks (including the tax).  I had to get a hotel room since the drive is so long and tiring. (4 hours!).  Got a decent nights sleep and luckily I didn't have to be at the police academy until noon.  I ended up getting there an hour earlier since I was afraid I wouldn't find parking.  

As I was taking the exam, I'm running like crazy around this small gym.  I'm doing pretty good in getting through all the obstacles and the last part is the dummy drag.  I grabbed it by the arm (not recommended if actually dragging a real person, hehe) and started dragging it while walking backwards.  This is probably the easiest way to do it.  I'm getting close to the finish line and I fall backwards.  I kind of yell out in shock.  I was a little dumbfounded since I didn't think that would happen.  Luckily, I had the test givers there yelling at me ""get up"", ""finish the exam"".  That snapped me right out of it and I got back up and finish  the course.  

Now, they allow you to do it in 44.4 seconds.  If you go over that, then you have to do a whole slew of other tests (sit ups, bike riding, etc) to past this portion of the test, and when I finally saw my time I couldn't believe it.  It was 44.23 seconds.  Ha!, talk about a close call.  I think if I didn't fall I probably would have had a  good time like 39 or 40 seconds.  Because I figured that I used up a good 5 seconds falling, getting that dummy off of me (it fell on my leg), getting up and finishing.

Still hard to believe how close I was.  At least I passed. :D  It just goes to show, if you get knocked down, pick yourself up and keep going.  Now, I have to go back in October for the Oral Interview.  If I pass that, then they'll start the background check.  Still a long road ahead."

Had an interview today for some data entry position.  It was with a debt collection agency and part of the job duties will be to fill in and eventually take a collector's job.  I don't want to do that type of job.  I can't imagine the stress one goes through calling up people for eight hours and try to get them to pay their bill.  It really takes a certain kind of person I think.

Next week is my Physical Agility exam for SFPD.  I've been running almost everyday to build up my endurance.  This week I'm up to a mile and 3/4.  I'm hoping to get to 2 miles by middle of the month.  The exam is mainly an endurance test, and I need to complete their course in 44.4 seconds.  It's not really hard, but it's funny to think that my future is riding on 44 seconds. :)  If longer than 44 seconds then there is a slew of other tests to take to see if one's physically fit.  It's funny to see that they want the candidates to be physically fit before they join but once they become cops it isn't emphasized as much.  Haven't you noticed how many fat cops there are out there?  More than there should be.  Well, it's a stressful job, so I'll cut them some slack. :)  I'm confident that I'll pass.

As we left the bowling alley last night, I was driving towards a police sobriety check point, and my phone started to ring.  It was in my front pocket and hard to get too.  As I was trying to get it out my car was swerving on the road.  I'm sure the cops saw me and asked me if I had anything to drink. hehe.  Of course I didn't, but knowing cops, I bet they were hoping to get a drunk driver. :)  I think I need to get some pants with a special pocket for a cell phone or maybe one with a belt clip.  hehe."

"event","Went to San Francisco yesterday.  I had my written exam for the SFPD and I think I did fairly well.  Alot of people taking the test but that's to be expected.  Maybe not as much as three years ago the last time I took it, but alot nevertheless.  Maybe over 1,000?  Since I was in the afternoon session and they already had the morning session.  

Someone from the command staff gave a little pep talk and mentioned that in the next fiscal year they will run 3 academy classes each with 40 to 50 people.  That's great, so I'll just need to get into the top 150 to  get a good chance of getting a spot.  Next step is the physical agility in August.  I think I'll much better this time around.

It's so hot now.  SF weather was very nice...only around 80 degrees.  I went to visit a friend in Fremont after my exam and the high there was 90: and they thought that was too hot!  They should live in the valley. hehehe.  I heard it got very high yesterday in the central valley, I'm not sure since I didn't get home until 10:30pm.  But I believe it, and it's going to be another scorcher today...it's been hot all morning.  I'm trying to lay off the A/C as much as possible (since I'm the only one home right now) because it just adds so much to the electric bill.  Valley weather sucks! I wish I was at the coast were it's cool.  :)"

"event","Had a decent Fourth of July Holiday.  Saw some fireworks here in town.  Wasn't the best I've seen but for a free show, one can't really complain.  It was at the stadium at my old school (Redwood) at their stadium: which has gone by so many names that I just refer to it as the Bowl or Mineral King Bowl(the name of the street that it's on).  We had some neighbors light off fireworks on the street and they made a hell-of-a mess.  Stuff was all over our driveway and yard.  I cleaned most of it up but at least later the following day they help to clean up the mess they made.

It's sad to hear about what happened in London.  I don't know anyone there but feel sad for them anyways.  Been keeping an eye on the news about the bombings there, and am glad that ""Londoners"" are able to handle this tragedy pretty well.  As I think about what happened I realize that an attack like this can happen anywhere at anytime.  There aren't enough cops/military to protect everyone all the time.  One can't be afraid to go out or live life, but just be aware and prepared.

Not much else is going on.  Have put in some applications around town but still haven't heard anything.  Summer is always a bad time to look for work.  Tuesday, I'm off to San Francisco to take the written test for the police department.  Not worried about the test, but just not looking forward to the drive.  I don't like long drives like I use to.  It's going to be 4 hours up and 4 hours back.  Also the test is going to be about 4 hours long...yuck.  

Been watching alot of movies lately...too lazy to write reviews (hehe) but do recommend Batman Begins, SW Episode 3, War of the Worlds, and just yesterday saw Fantastic 4.  Alot of decent blockbuster movies this summer.  I just wish the price didn't go up..now it's $8.50 to see a movie."

Although, I canceled all my bank cards so can't use them until the new ones come.  Hmm, better safe than sorry.  

My cousin and auntie are here for the weekend.  Why they wanted to come up to this oven for the holiday's is beyond me since it's much cooler in Orange County.  But it's good to see them again.  Might watch a movie tonight.  I've seen some interesting ones lately, and will write about them in another post.

Now I just have to be more careful with my personal belongings. If I do this again, then I should be smacked upside the head. hehe."

I did so many errands today and was just exhausted that I didn't think anything of it an hour ago.  I retraced my steps and narrowed it down to two public areas.  Went back there and no luck.  Talked to the security guard at the EDD (unemployment office) and he didn't find any.  If I did lose it there, it's GONE! hehe. I didn't have much cash in there, but it does contain my Driver's License, Social Security Card, and my bank cards.  Hopefully they won't be able to use then without my PIN.

I've never lost my wallet before.  Oh, I've misplaced it before a few times, but this is the first time I actually lost it.  And for some reason it seems to give my mom full range to point out all my faults in my life.  I think she was just looking for an excuse to go off on me.  And boy did she!  Jezz, you'd think I lost the codes the the nukes or something. *RME*

1).  Got my new DL now.  Yup, just as I thought, the photo is horrendous.  Ok, that may be a bit harsh, but it's bad.  I had no choice though since I had to renew it that day.  Oh well, what can you do.

2).  Finally got laid off at Josten's last Friday.  The season is over now.  So being out of work sucks, but I'm glad I don't have to work the graveyard shift.  You know, I don't really mind shift work, but I should of been paid much more than what I was getting.  Time to look for something else and get unemployment in the mean-time.  Hopefully, it'll be a little more than last year.

3).  Watch Star Wars Episode III.  Had to mentioned this because it was a great movie. :)  It turned out a lot better than I thought it would.  It's definitely darker and more complex than the other films.  I like stories with a little more depth and character development.  I won't go into a long review but this one is one that I would recommend.  You don't have to be a fan of Star Wars or sci-fi to enjoy it.  On an interesting footnote, when I was watching this film, this girl (who was with her bf or whatever) was sniffing and crying a bit (maybe) thoughout the movie.  I was surprised but, I have to agree, I thought it was moving too!.  hehe.  Oh, I'm not making fun of her or anything.  :)  She wasn't like a die hard fan or anything, she just probably got caught up in the whole Anakin/Padme story line.  It's really sad when you think about what happenes between them too.   Everyone loves a tragic love story right?  Same with the Anakin/Obi Wan realtionship.  Good drama, the movie is. :D  Good job George!"

I thought I would be the crowds but no such luck!  Lines had already formed up and it took me about 40 minutes to get through everything.  They ended up taking another photo of me.  My old one was from my first DL (back in High School!) and it was time to updated it.  HOWEVER, I looked like crap since I just got off the night shift, hair is a mess, had a five-o-clock shadow, and probably bags under my eyes since I was tired.  There wasn't even a mirror to look into before getting the photo snapped.  I had to use the security monitor just to get an idea of how bad I looked.  hehe.  Now, I'm not vain at all about this kind of stuff, really...but the DMV is notorious about taking bad DL photo's.  I have yet to meet anyone that actually liked their DL photo.  We shall see in a couple of weeks. :)"

"event","Been working alot these past few weeks.  I'm exhausted but it helps getting overtime.  Although, It seems I just go through the money faster.  Am going to get some cavities filled so that will take some of my paycheck.  Luckily, I got insurance from work so I'm only paying 20% of the full cost.  I would really like to get my teeth bleached but insurance doesn't cover it and it's about $500.  I wonder if it's really worth it though.  I see what they do on Extreme Makeover, and it looks really good.  So if I have some extra money, I just might do it.

My birthday came and went.  Thanks to all those who sent me cheers and greetings, and to those who didn't...eh, no big deal since it isn't a big deal to celebrate it anymore.  It's been like that for a long time now, now that I think about it.

"event","Hard to believe it's May already.  Work at Jostens is coming to a close since almost all of the yearbooks are in the final production stages.  I'm back in the warehouse working as the books are being printed, sowed, cut, etc.  It's not bad working back there.  Get to get some exercise (from all the manual labor) and it's interesting to see the process a book goes through to get made.  It's kinda cool to see how my work up in the digital side ends up actually looking.  Plus I get to work about another month, which gives me a little more time to find another job.

Speaking of jobs, there isn't much out there now.  Well, at least not in Visalia and the central valley.  I might have to go on Unemployment for a little bit until I can find some work.  I'm going to apply to <a href=""http://www.sfgov.org/site/police_index.asp"">SFPD</a> since they are hiring again.  Last time they did was back in 2002.  It'll be a chance for me to move to the bay area and work in a nice paying job.  Last time I tested with them, I didn't do so well on one section of the test since my father was sick and I had to take care of him.  Perhaps, my self-conscience didn't allow me to do so well.  If I had passed everything and got hired by the department, I would have moved away and felt guilty I wasn't their at home to help out.  This time around I think I'll do much better.

I want to get me a PS2, since they are cheap now: $149 for a new slim one.  I miss having a Playstation around.  I would really like to get one of the new PSP's...but they are just too much!  Well, at least for my budget. :)"

"event","I've been so busy lately that I've neglected my LJ too long.  I've been meaning to update, but working nights, another job, and dating someone kept me too busy.

Speaking of dating, Kristen and I are no longer seeing each other.  I'm glad actually.  It wasn't going anywhere for awhile and thought about calling it off many times.  I think I let it go on longer than it should have, because I didn't want to just quit.  I was making an effort to make it work, that way, at least I can say I did my best.  But we really didn't have much in common and it was so hard to get her to spend time with me.  I knew she was busy, same as I, but I always tried to make time for her, but she hardly made time for me.  And when she did, it seemed like she rather be at the dentist. hehe.  So after spring break, she stopped talking to me.  She stopped answering her phone, and I couldn't leave messages since she turned off her answering machine.  So, after a few calls I got the hint.  Although, I think the way to end a relationship is to tell that person it's over.  The way she did this just shows that she has no class.

Tomorrow should be my last day of work at World Market.  I've been wanting to quit for a couple of months now.  Mainly because I didn't like having two jobs.  I was never getting ahead, cash wise, and all my time was taken up.  Now they seriously cut my hours at World Market to 5 a week.  It really isn't even worth buring the gas to go work.  I figured this will be a good time as any to leave and two weeks ago I had put in my notice to quit."

"event","The balloon bouquet went over well.  She really liked them and seemed to perk up her day.  I'm glad she did, because that was the desired effect.  So it was a Friday, and that day she asked me if I could come over and help her put together her new futon bed that she bought.  I said sure, no problem.  I didn't mind helping her out.  It took about 3 hours and it turned out much better than I thought.

A couple of days later we went out to eat at Red Lobster and had a good time.  Seemed like everything was going well.  As the week went by we made plans to go to this comedy show in town for the 11th.  I told her about it a week in advance and bought the tickets this past Tuesday.  I told her about that and as Friday rolled around I couldn't get in touch with her.  I called her cell phone and left a message but she never returned my calls.  

I got a hold of her yesterday and she told me that her friend got into a car accident and she was at the hospital with her and didn't have her phone: she left it at home and the battery ran out.  She also said she didn't have change and couldn't call me.   Hmm....ok, I guess that's a pretty good excuse.  It may be true...but there's a little doubt about this story in the back of my mind.  I guess I'm always suspicious of people. hehe.  I'll give her the benefit of doubt about the friend's accident but a phone call would have been courteous.

Other news, the weather here is really strange now...it was unseasonable warm all week, with the temps in the high 70's/low 80's...now today it's somewhere in the mid-60's.  Which it's suppose to be to time of year!  I wish it would stay more consistent.  But living in this valley, that won't happen; which goes to show, this is another reminder why I need to move. :)"

"event","Do you ever get the feeling that someone you like wants to distance themselves from you and you're not sure why?  I think that's what's going on with Kristen.  We've been dating for a little over a month, and in the beginning she seemed all into me, but lately has been distancing herself and I'm not sure why.  I think partly it has to do with me, I can be somewhat selfish at times.

The other night we had made plans to go out the next day.  She told me she would call me after she got after class and we could decide what to do.  Well, she didn't call and  I didn't call her either.  I'm the kind of guy whom believes someone when they say they are going to call.  Yet, she expected me to call her anyways.  The day after that, I ran into her at work and she just went right by me.  I stopped her and asked why she didn't call.  She told me that I could've called her too.  I then said that hey, if you promise to call you should do it.  She then said that she wasn't going to argue with me and that if I wanted to hate her I can.  As if it was no big deal to her.  I thought to myself, what the hell kind of reason is that?  :)  This is just a recent example of how she's been acting towards me.

I know she has been real busy with school and work.  I've been busy too but I always try to make time to go out with her, and I had expected her to do the same.  She use to but then had change recently.  Maybe she's playing games, I don't know.  But after thinking about the situation, I realize that she's right.  She's not obligated to call me or anything.  Don't get me wrong, it would be nice if she did, but I shouldn't expect too much so soon.  In fact I shouldn't demand that she act the way I want her to, but to let her come on her own.  

When you haven't dated in awhile, you tend to get a little rusty on how things should work. :p  I guess my big thing is not to worry so much, think positive, and just enjoy what I have because life is too short to stress the little details.

I went today and bought her a balloon bouquet that's going to be delivered tomorrow to her home.  A bit much?  Eh, maybe, but I wanted to cheer her up a little since she really has been under a lot of stress these past few weeks.  And I'm sure I have added to that somewhat.  Hey, no one's perfect. :)


Sonny got hired back by HPD so he's off to Hawaii for good come May.  In a way I'm envious.  I wouldn't mind going back to live in Hawaii.  I enjoyed it a lot and had a real good experience with the place.  Although, it wouldn't be the same going back.  All the friends I made there are pretty much all gone and the few that have remain are into their own routines and probably couldn't make much time to fit me in.  Know what I mean?  So I would have to start all over again...but starting over in paradise isn't so bad. :)  So I think Sonny will be happier there than he was in Riverside.  At least he'll get his career going again."

On the weekends I've taken up Fencing and Bowling.  I'm enjoying both sports but don't get much sleep now on the weekends.  Plus going out sometimes on dates keeps me from getting sleep but am not complaining about that.  In fact I don't think we go out enough.

Our relationship is kind of weird.  Without getting too much into details right now, I feel like I'm always getting mixed signals from her.  I never get a straight answer from her and it's always hard trying to get her to go out.  Yet she always wants to talk to me almost everyday on the phone.  There's more to it than just that, but that's for another entry.

Work is getting crazy.  I think Jostens is starting to get too harsh on the folks there.  Firing people over little things when others whom mess up worse just get a slap-on-the wrist.  Yup, life may not be fair, but that doesn't mean we have to like it.

Fencing class starts up this Saturday.  I'm looking forward to it.  I got 3 people to sign up with me...one good friend and two co-workers.

It wasn't much of a vacation though since she had to have some back surgery and was laid up in bed most of the time.  They had to do something to her disk.  Not sure exactly what, she really couldn't explain it too me.  But what ever it was exactly requires her to wear a back brace for a couple of months.  Not so bad when you think about it...could have been worse.

She did bring me back some goodies.  I love mentos candy...specially their grape flavored ones.  However, you can't buy grape flavored mentos here in the USA.  Seriously, I haven't been able to find grape flavored mentos at all...where the whole package is nothing but grape flavored.  Couldn't find it Hawaii, and can't find it here in California.  I knew they sold it in Asia since a friend of mine had brought some back from Taiwan.  So I had her get me some when she was there to visit her folks.  Sometimes, it doesn't really take much to make me happy.  Everyone in my family thinks I'm weird because of this. hehehe.

"event","Here I am, on the 4th day of the new year, and I can't help but wish that 2004 never ended. It was the best and worst year of my life. My birthday is in exactly 20 days... I'm not too excited. SUre.. another reason to drink and be stupid, but it's not like I can do it with the people that I did it with last year. My best friends in the world. Allyson, Seth, Zeke, and Jennifer were all there. I miss them all so mucho! It was hard to let go, but I figure new year, new beginning. Maybe something good will come. Maybe I'll get out of this lonely, depressed state I am constantly in. My new year's resolution is to change my way of thinking. Maybe I can get ahold of my life in some way or form. I duno... New Year's is rather depressing. Another year for everything to go to hell. UGH!! I have to stop thinking this way. Well, at least I have Seth and Irvin to talk to. I miss them so much. At least they have eachother. I feel like I have no one... when I'm not at school, I'm at home thiking about how bad school is gonna suck the next day. The only thing that makes it enjoyable is my friends Charlie, Letty, Tiffany, and Kelly. Other than that... school is HELL. So tomorrow, when I got to school, I'm gona try to have a good attitiude all because it's my resolution... hope it works.

"event","Well, I must say, this has been the best Christmas ever... considering that I just barely moved here about 3 months ago. Ok, to start it all off, the same day as my last entry... Seth came over!! I knew he had something to do with it!! My parents had paid for him to fly down here for 4 days. It was sooo awesome!! I still can't believe they did that! So the first day he was here, we went to Desert Ridge and bought a few things. Then, later that night, we went to Castles n' Coasters and rode the coaster like 10 times. It was very fun! The next day, we hung out at my house and went to Mill St. in Tempe. I bought a HUGE Alice poster. It's the original drawing of her with the caterpillar. He has his hooka, and she's peaking over the edge. It's SWEET! The next day, we went to QT in the morning for Taquitos. It was fun. My mom got home from work later that night, and we went to this mexican restraunt for dinner. After that, we went to Wal*Mart and bought Alice In Wonderland (He had never seen it). We watched it, then went to bed. The next day was the last day he would be here :( We just hung out all day. When my mom got home for work, it was time for us to take him to the airport. I did my best not to cry when he left. It was sad, but I knew I would see him agian. The next day, I would leave to Cali for a week. It was fun. I got a bunch of money and like 3 presents for Christmas. My aunt gave me $50 and with that I got my nose pierced on Monday night. It was sooo scary at first! I was shaking, but that was just nerves. It didn't hurt that bad. The guy who did it was super hott! Man, he reminded me of Travis in Blink 182. His name was Matt. WOWIE! ANyways, we came home yesterday. SO that brings me to where I am right now... bored out of my mind with nothing to do except write in this journal. Oh well... I had bunches of fun, and it's kinda nice to rest.

I pressed redial on her phone, and it gave me my best friend Seth's phone number! I don't know what she was doing calling him. The other day my cousin asked me if it sucked that I was here all alone with no friends flying in and out of town. He had just told me that he knew what my present was...I DUNNO!! It's driving me insane!! AND yesterday on the phone Seth said that on Saturday, he thought it would be the craziest day ever! Now, today IS Saturday, and I've surely gone insane! I was looking through mother's glove compartment, and she caught me and got upset because she thought I knew my present! So whatever it is... something that has to do with it is in the car. She won't let me go near the car for the rest of the day! Whatever it is... It's happening today! I think Seth knows whats going on. HE HAS TO! Ugh! I better go before I go iNsAnE! Well, I already am... but you shouldn't have to whitness it.

It's so big that she wont even tell anyone else what it is! It's been driving me crazy since Wednesday night! Well, finals are this coming week. I haven't even begun to study, but that's ok cuz i'm good at craming. I've been reading the original Alice in Wonderland lately. It's far more amazing than the movie. There is a CATERPILLAR WITH SLEEVES BUT NO SHIRT!! I don't know... everytime I get into it i feel as if i've surely gone crazy. Like I'n on a weird ass trip...I'm hungry...OOH! I was watching My Coolest Years on VH1 and it was the one about hippies! Steve-O was the biggest hippie. Oh well, my life is not that interresting so therefore there is nothing else to write...

Last night, I was on the phone all night with one of my best friends. While i was on the phone, my other friend, zeke, called. I didnt get his message until this morning. I called him back, and he was telling me about how he misses me and loves me. Considering this is the first time he's called me since i moved here, i didnt want to hear it because i spent so many nights crying and wanting to kill myself just because i was so upset that he didnt care enough to call. His excuse... work. He doesnt work 24 hours a day, so i know he has at least 20 minutes he can spare. So as he was telling me about how much he still missesme and how much he wishes i was there and that he never loved anyone before me, i was telling myself not to fall into that trap again because it'll only hurt me more in the long run. So we sat there and talked for about an hour and he was getting high during this time period, but for once in my life, it didnt bother me. There's nothing i hate more then zeke getting stoned. Well, the whole point is that i am over him. It's too late for him to be saying all those things... maybe a month ago, but not now... it's just too late. Zeke, I'm over you."

Charlie isn't hanging out with us at lunch anymore, I'm starting to think its because of me. I don't know why. I think i come off sometimes as really annoying, but i just want to pretend I'm happy. Man, Things at my house havent gotten mucho better, but I'm hoping they will one day. I'm not sure if i want to finish High-School. I mean, i would love to, but as of right now i see no point in trying. I dunno. I called my friend Jenna the other day, she didnt answer wich was rather dissapointing. I'll call her sumtime this weekend. My parents STILL havent asked me what i wanted for christmas. i dont mean to sound like a horrible spoiled child, but they already asked my brother. I'm wondering if it's cuz they already got me something, or because they know what i want and i simply cant have it. I cant wait to sleep in saturday morning. it will be the best thing that ever happens in my life. haha. Yesterday was my Pal Al's B-Day. So if you read this happy b-day and i luv u and a letter shall be arriving at ur house sometime next week.

Let me see your insides
Or write me off

Give me all... whatever you want

"event","Well, the life at school gradually gets a little better each day. There's these 3 girls i hang out with. Charlie, Letty, and Tiffany. If it weren't for them i wouldn't look forward to lunchtime each day. haha they make me laugh. Well, as school continues to get better my home life just gets worse. I talked to my best friend Seth today. I miss him so so much. He's the best friend i've ever had. I love him. Anyways... i find myself wondering if it would be worth it to go back to odessa. I love the place and it's home, but im afraid it wont be for much longer. From now on i want nothing to do with zeke. he's disgusting and pathetic and i'm sick of his bullshit. I could live the rest of my life with irvin and seth. irvin said the nicest thing that anyone has ever said to me the other night. 

Irvin: ""You know the best memory i have of you was that day that me and seth came to pick you and zeke up at your house for lunch. The first thing you did was look up at me and smiled. Then you ran up to hug me.""

Me: ""Why was that so great?""

Irvin: ""Your smile. You have the greatest smile.""

Me: ""Wow, thanks.""

Irvin: ""Yeah, even when you were here i knew you deserved much better than zeke. If you find someone over there, don't settle for less than perfect. You deserve the best.""

That almost made me cry. I miss home so much. Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to forget everything? Would forgetting make it better or worse? Would you feel empty when forgotten? Or would knowing nothing be better than knowing at all?"

I'm not going to go into how it all happened and what exactly happened, but it wasn't pretty. But I am now grounded from the phone, which was my only outlet from this hell. I got the phone bill today. I've spent $86 in long distance to hOdessa. Oh well, mother wasn't mad. I was very surprised, but I supposively get my phone disconnected sometime by the end of this week. Oh well, today was an OK day. I finally straightened my hair for the first time in like a month. I have to do science and French homework before I go to bed tonight. I got lucky today and the science teacher counted me as having all my work from yesterday (Which I didn't). I'm really working on bringing my grades up. It'll be easy once I turn in all my French homework and this English project I have due on the 2nd of December. Man, it's almost 10:00 so I better get started on the homework, but before I do, I shall leave you with a song...

I figured that working on it might keep me busy for a while instead of going crazy and not knowing what to do. The link is http://whenseptemberends.bravehost.com It's ok I spose. Kinda boring right now, but I'm sure it'll get better once I put some effort into it. I talked to one of my really good friends, Irvin, last night. It was nice. I miss him a lot too. He's so funy. My cousins went partying last night. I wish I could go, but I don't know their friends that well and I'd be very uncomfortable. I have recently found out that I won't be getting to Texas until summer. That sucks because I miss Odessa so much.

Haha! My 7th grade science teacher tore her clock off the wall!! It was an inside joke between me and my best friend Allyson. Anyways, i'm supposed to be grounded right now due to a argument with mother's husband. He's a dick. I don't care (obviously). I am contemplating running away. It would have been easier to accomplish in Odessa, but since i hesitated too long that one night to call Zeke... I'm stuck here. That was my only chance to get out of there. Stupid me. Anyways... the only way out of here is if I save enough money for a one way ticket to Midland, and then after that I'd have to get someone to take me to the airport. Plus, I can't buy a ticket on my own considering I'm only 14 years of age... 15 in January. Well... I'm bored of writing now. Be back when something worth writing about happens."

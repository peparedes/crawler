how i've misunderstood this song for so long:

In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change, still you forced away into my scheme of things
You say we're growing, growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again, you're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell

Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things

Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

it's about god. obviously. i never knew what he was saying at certain crucial parts, and therefore didn't realize it was about god. i am such a moron.
because according to me lord= oh, and prayer= breath"

i am a bit disgruntled, because some people seem to have misconstrued my situation in france. I do not feel that i did anything wrong, but who knows? if people think im weak or pathetic or too hasty in coming back, they can go spend 2 weeks with the dumays and prove themselves right. 

ok, so here are the things i am looking forward to.

-seeing everyone.
-the seemingly endless list of exciting events approaching.
-school (first time in forever)
-my life.

things im not looking forward to
-explaining myself to people. three words- it was bad.
-make up work , j'ai beacoup de travaille pour rattraper, as they say in french.
-mr.toy

even though i am so thankful that i am home, i still feel awkward about the whole exchange student thing. my family and i know perfectly well that i did the right thing in returning, but i really do not want people hassling me about returning, and saying 
""you didn't give it very long"" etc. thank god i didn't give it very long.

i just want everyone to understand, and that is very unlikely."

"event","two things i have learned...
exchange programs are only for people who have very little to leave behind and miss
also, you really don't know what you've got til it's gone.

so, my classes are not sufficient to complete ""11th"" grade, and so this is a problem. also, i trust my judgement and i know that being here is not for me. i tried to be nice to everyone, work hard 5(the farm is awesome), but i know that two girls do not like me because i hang around them too much...need i say NO SHIT SHERLOCK? hello!!i do not speak perfect french nor do i have any idea what is ever going on, because they often forget to tell me.

in conclusion, i am not sorry i came here. in such a short time i learned a lifetime of things... but, it is not for me, not for someone who loves their friends so much, or more importantly, not for someone who won't allow people to comme on dit, se blesse se blesse se blesse because the person is not the me as them.

at first, i was hesitant to come back, because i thought i would feel weak, but in reality, it is a harder decision to make to come back, than it is to leave.

so, after all, france is still wonderful, but living with some people who would abandon as quickly me in montmartre as they would except a million dollar check, is not wonderful. 

apparently; the other exchange students had no friends at home to miss; quelle surprise?????

what do you guys think, if you came to france and hated life, and knew that it could only worsen, would you leave? knowing also that upon return to cali a year later your future would nearly be screwed beyond repair??(failed to tell me this...)

think whatever you want, but i am doing what i think is best for myself, my education, and my parents.

with hope,
chan the man

p.s. i dont know if i will be going to no ho, but it does not matter, as long as i am back."

i cannot describe <I>everything</i> that happened at nslc, that would take forever, but i can say that i had an excellent time. i represented cameroon in the palestine/israel security council, and my fellow cameroonians were definitely a major factor in enjoying my time there.
i am going to develop my pictures, and maybe figure out how to post them. i always have difficulty recounting trips or experiences that span more than a day or so, but here is a brief run-down of some people i met.

jason my t.a.- ass-grabber, but overall excellent man. his first impression of me was that i was ""sassy"" and needed to smile more ( sassy meaning bitchy). but then, we parted on very good terms, and i love him.
ryan- from chicago...all i can say is that he was perfect. grr.
sara- my love, haha. we spoke french all the time together, and without her i would have died. we had the best time, and i am going to miss her an unreasonable amount.
marcus- the funniest man alive ( besides frosty). he looks so goofy, and at first he acted like david updegrove, because he goes to an all boys school and does not know how to socialize with girls, but then he got used to us, and proved to not only be incredibly smart ( we had an hour long convo about donne,blake and wordsworth) but also sweet and hilarious.
wanchi- really cute, a little apprehensive when it comes to being herself, but overall a great person. she was the first person i befriended so i love her.
stefan- my republican brother from another mother. he was so awesome, what more can i say, we owned our security council.

there were many others, but those were who i was closest with, i know my account is very brief and lame, but oh well.

so many stories...so little time...


luv, chan
degs i wish you would have been there.
core- ryan is from chicago and says ""hyat"" not hot."

krav maga= pain. 200 push-ups- my specialty and yet i gave in and did womanly push-ups for the last 50- so disappointed. then, we did an exhorbitant amount of crunches and then that football drill where you run in place, drop and push-up, then we finally started doing krav, which included this painful-yet awesome- rope thing.

brighter/more superficial note= two gorgeous men joined... 17 and 16. oh wait- no chance in hell, nevermind.
anyway, i went to winnetka 30 times today for matrix tickets and almost was slaughtered in the parking lot.
what else... oh ya, hooray for core's party this week-end, i am seeing darwin prob sunday, and i have a lot of homework- hooray! this standardized testing business is wonderful, though tomorrow is the math section and guess who is going to fail the addition section? whateva. i am thirsty.

"event","succeeding a relatively eventful day, today was exceptionally mediocre without a trace of daftness to
entertain me.
kaitlin plat and i were going to go somewhere after school but she could not contact her dad in time
and therefore i was left with two options : walk to starbucks by myself and hang out there or go to my stepdad's work and be bored out of my mind, but have a computer... i chose the latter and what a mistake it has been. the only productive thing i have managed to do is dig up richard's resume from this computer. 
i have not relinquished my annoyance with mr.toy yet, though today he was much nicer...that man can suck it.
also, my french class has once again reverted to slandering me because i get better grades than they do on tests..i am sorry, what do you want me to do, progressively and purposely do worse on tests? blow me! 
a certain person was driving me crazy today because they would not cease to complain about a b, i was about to lay the smack down on him/her, but i was in a good mood.
do you know there are a lot of lj communities about murder? i was curious to see who included tvc15 on their interests list and one person had murder in their list which was bold so i clicked it and a wealth of listings appeared... future serial killers unite! anyway...
those of who you have seen vg and have suggestions about what items/accessories are appropriate for a themed party about this please give me ideas, i have drawn a blank on what i should get...
what else, what else? oh, on the topic of israel and palestine, it annoys me how people do not look at both sides when adopting an opinion about the matter, it is always so biased and that won't change but it does not nullify the obnoxiousness of it.
ok i should go before i write 10 pages, bye

my soccer team is retarded, except for lara, katherine, jaimie and a few others, they cannot follow directions, it makes me so annoyed. i play center defense and i am supposed to tell them what to do, and i literally have to wave my arms over my head and scream in their ears if i want them to even try to do something. how difficult is it to return to your positions when the other team has the ball? geez. anyway.

i should go and start some kind of homework. no quiero hacer mi tareja. richard had an argument in spanish about a blakc cat yesterday, we didn't even know what we were tlaking about but thats ok.

"event","the most pleasant dream i have had in a long while:
i was on a boat, which took me forever to get to for the sand kept melting away while the waves swallowed up my raft. finally after much difficulty reaching the ship, i and several others boarded it. it was there that we were told to be ""counselors"" to the children on the boat. with no disagreement about our new found responsibility we basically neglected the children and went to a party that was being held beneath us. and so we went, (here is where it became beautiful) a song came on which i do not remember if it was actually sw or i was dreaming another song, but the point is i went behind the dj's table and realized that chris hall was actually singing the song. so i screamed something along the lines "" omg, that is chris hall"" and then the whole floor cleared(i do not know why) and him and i started talking and it was amazing because despite it's lack of reality i actually felt like someone cared/wanted to know me. and when he had to leave we hugged for what seemed like hours and then he left. well, then i went back to my ""position"" on the boat and all of the kids that i was supposed to be watching mutinied and told the instructor. and so i was fired and literally thrown off the ship, but i never cared. 
and then i woke up...

while that dream was one of the more normal/less interesting dreams i have had it is always better to remember the good ones than dwell on the others."

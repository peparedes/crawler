It's an irrevocable fact that my life is forever changed. It's all overwhelmingly wonderful, sad, scary, and exciting at the same time. Giving birth was the most painful and difficult experience I have ever gone through, and that was only the beginning. I don't know if I could've done anything more to prepare for it and for what's in store for Frank and me as we raise Nora, but I'm just trying to take it one day at a time. 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v189/haylmerri/nora_1/100_7608.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>
I thought about writing the whole birth story down here, but it's too long to get into too deeply. It went as well as it could've gone, given that there were complications during my labor and delivery experience that made up for my fairly uncomplicated pregnancy. Nora came out strong and healthy, though, and that's all I wanted. The first few days (weeks) of post-partum were really rough for me, physically and emotionally. I've never really been sick, so having to spend a week in the hospital, at one point not even being able to get out of bed on my own, was really traumatic. I felt (still kinda feel) worn out, but it's getting better every day, despite the lack of sleep. Since Nora doesn't sleep through the night, neither do I.

Frank's been really great, though. He gets up at night and helps take care of all the stuff I can't do on my own. And it's been really good to have his Mom and my mom here to help. I've definitely got a great support system in place. Nora's baptism is Sunday, and a bunch of family are coming up to see the baby. I can't wait have everyone meet her. Plus, friends have been so sweet, sending congratulations and gifts. I feel bad that I can't get back to everyone and say thanks, but I hope they all know that I really appreciate it all. (Anyway, I'm letting Frank handle all the communications.)

She's already grown so much in the past 20 days. It feels like we've had her forever already. When I look at bigger size clothes that she's gonna wear in a couple months, it amazes me that she's only going to get bigger. All her little faces, noises, and movements are so fascinating to me. She's just trying to figure out how everything works. It's endlessly entertaining.

I'm trying not to stress too much about how I'm going to deal with going back to work. I can hardly bear to leave her upstairs while I'm downstairs at home. I'm breastfeeding, so we're trying to work out how we're going to feed her (she eats every 2 hours) when things start winding up again. And that's not even going into WHO will be around to feed and care for her when I have to go back. 6 weeks of maternity leave feels too long and too short at the same time.

I knew in my mind that things were going to change, but it didn't really hit me until I was holding this sweet little person in my arms. She has absolutely changed everything, from my perspective of the world to how I handle day-to-day activities. I'm going to miss the days of just me and Frank, which seem so easy and carefree now that I look back on them. But I wouldn't go back, now that we have Nora, who is so beautiful and blessed. I'm going to go downstairs and hold her now. I've already been away from her too long.

<img src=""http://www.cupacake.com/images/container-open-withcake.jpg"">
By Liz Seymour (c) 2006, The Washington Post
Okay, so it's not a key to peace in our time, but the very modesty of its mission has a certain charm: a way to transport individual cupcakes. The Container Store is actually selling a plastic case big enough to fit just one cupcake without smearing the frosting.
The organizational emporium jumped at the chance to sell shelter for the trendiest of baked goods - now the subject of blogs, cookbooks and even national days of honor - according to a company spokeswoman. No word yet whether anyone is buying.
The Cup-A-Cake holder is available in stores now and soon at <a href=""http://www.thecontainerstore.com"">www.thecontainerstore.com</a> in teal, pink and royal blue for $2.99 each. Also available at <a href=""http://www.cupacake.com"">www.cupacake.com</a>.

<lj-cut text=""Nesting instinct and other ramblings"">

It's so weird to look outside at 7 p.m. and still see the sun out. I feel like I have so much more time to get stuff done. It's been a good week so far, more relaxing than the past couple of weeks since work has calmed down a bit. I was training my replacement for when I go on leave. I forgot how complicated this job can be, so there were a lot of little things I had to tell her about. In addition to making sure I was covering everything, I also still had to get an issue out and also work on another project at the same time. All in all, very stressful. I'm a little worried about how she's going to be able to handle it all when I'm gone. But she's going to have to step up if she wants to get it done. In the end, the answer always is ""just figure it out on your own"" because that's what I had to do. But we'll see if she'll be able to hack it; No whining, just working. I have mixed feelings about leaving work. It will be nice to take the break, but I don't know how I'll be able to stay gone for so long without worrying about stuff. 

I've been baking a lot lately, what with the nesting instinct and all the special occasions like Frank's birthday, our wedding anniversary, etc. I've used my Betty Crocker bake and fill a few times now, and it's way fun, but sometimes I like just hammering out some cupcakes or cookies. A cake is hard to transport, and unless people come over, I have to make special efforts to make sure it gets eaten.

Other things brought on by my nesting instinct: I'm in the kitchen a lot more than I used to be, whether it's doing the dishes or cooking or checking over the food that's in the fridge and cupboards. Today I gathered up all of the baby's stuff that needs to be washed and got that all ready to go: unwrapping the stuff, turning it all inside-out, getting the hamper, buying the baby detergent. I'm always running through checklists in my mind of what we still need, where I should get it, when I would need to get it (can it wait until after the baby is born?), where I can get it the cheapest. We got the car seat/stroller/playpen last weekend, so we're pretty much all set with what we'll need right after the baby is born. It's getting really soon, and it's scary to think that it could possibly happen any day now. I'd like to be as ready as possible by May 8 -- bag packed, forms filled out, car seat set up -- just in case. 

I've been feeling so big lately. The baby moves around a lot, and I can feel the difference between her arms and legs and what's going on. I've started to take bubble baths at night to ease some of the muscle strain and swelling. It's out of desperation, because our tub here is so small. When I'm laying flat underwater, my belly sticks up like an island. It's a good place to rest my book. :)

I have to wear a puffy maternity vest underneath because I can't zip up the coat anymore.

Most of you are probably curious to see how big my belly is now. This was taken last weekend.

Note how horrible my hair looks. Seeing this picture was the last straw.

I got a haircut yesterday, and I'm very happy with it. I find it a little shorter than I usually like, but I can deal, because it will grow out nicely and at least now it's a STYLE. 
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v189/haylmerri/livejournal2/100_6179.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image hosting by Photobucket""></a>
(This is a photo I had to take for my editor's letter for work. I'm working on a car-buying guide.)
I went to this really cool salon that's just down the street from the apartment. The stylist could see all that was wrong with my hair. She even used the words ""looks kinda like a MULLET"" (gasp!) to describe it -- just as I had suspected all along, yet no one else would confirm to me. She was able to see where to fix it, and she was very patient and deliberate. And when she washed my hair, no water splashed anywhere below my neck. Plus she was really easy to talk to. 
It looked totally modern in there, a stark contrast to everything else around here. And to seal the deal, they carried Bumble and Bumble products, so they used all that stuff on me. And when I bought a little tube of grooming creme, they wrapped it up in POLKA DOTTED (eep!) tissue paper and put it in a little B/B shopping bag. As if the quality of the haircut weren't enough to guarantee my newfound allegiance to this place. 
SUCH a different experience from what I'd been putting up with before. I don't know why I hadn't gone here until now.

On Tuesday, Frank and I went to a dr's appt. and toured the maternity ward at the hospital. The appointment was good. The baby's vitals were fine and all that. When the dr was feeling my belly she could see the baby kicking back. :)

I took the gest. diabetes screening, and I had to drink this sugary drink and they drew my blood. The nurse took two tries to draw, since on the first time the vein faded and she was digging around with the needle to find it. OUCH. But all I could think was all this other pain will be relatively mild compared to what I'm facing in a couple months. The mental preparation begins now. 

It was cool to see the maternity ward. It was clean and quiet and it smelled good, which are all good signs. The staff were friendly. The rooms looked comfortable. They practice ""couplet care"" there, so a nurse is assigned to each mother/baby for the whole of their stay. The baby can stay with me in my room the whole time I'm there, as long as she's healthy. They also let dads stay in the rooms too, as long as space allows. We're allowed to use cell phones and bring in our own food during recovery. It's not like what one would expect from a regular hospital visit. I'm glad that's what I have to look forward to."

Also: If you are looking for Coldstone inspiration, look no further. I feel compelled to share my ultimate Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream recipe: cheesecake ice cream with strawberries and cookie dough (not graham cracker -- it makes it too grainy). Go try it. It is heaven. I had some last week when I was at home and I've been dreaming about it ever since.

It's been such a long week, and it's only Wednesday. I was really productive today, even though I had to get up every 30 minutes to walk around because the baby kept kicking me. Her kicks are getting stronger now, but not yet strong enough that you can feel them from outside.

We had our ultrasound yesterday. She(!) looked good: active, responsive, and all her parts seem to be in order. She weighs 1 pound and her head is 5 cm wide. She's about the size of an open hand. It was so awesome to see her moving around. We could tell that she had the hiccups. The ultrasound lady (what's their job title?) kept telling her to keep still so she could take pictures; she kept rolling away from the ultrasound wand and covering her face and between her legs with her hands. It took a some shifting and coaxing to get her in the right angle. She was just shy, is all. :)

I've researched and picked out pretty much all the essentials: car seat, stroller, playpen, bathtub, etc. -- but all the clothes I have so far are neutral. Now that we know she's a girl, I'm ready to really look at baby clothes. I can pick out dresses! ^_^"

1. It's 9 degrees outside today.
2. I found the perfect area rug from Walmart, but the Ithaca store is apparently the only one in NY state that doesn't have it in stock.
3. Frank and I went to a dealership to look at cars, but they are closed on Sundays. It doesn't seem very smart to have a business like a car dealership closed on the weekends, but whatever man.

I feel like there are a million things we need to do, but no time to do it all. This upcoming work week is going to be very busy for me, and Frank has his talk to get ready for. On top of that, we have to find time to shop for a car (not the kind of decision you can rush through). There's also the whole business of getting ready for our trip home, such as packing, laundry, and making sure everything is in order before we leave. I've been wanting to see Memoirs of a Geisha for a while now, and I'm tired of waiting for Frank to take me. I want to see it today."

"event","I know it's been a while, but a lot has happened. A brief rundown:

- Spent New Year's in Philadelphia. Ate a lot. Bought some maternity pants, which are now the only pants I like to wear. I forget what a fly is for.
- Got into a rollover accident at midnight on the way home from Pa. Frank and I are both fine. (So is the baby -- we went to the dr. first thing in the morning.) The road was snowy and we were on a downhill curve. The car flipped upside down and we had to crawl out of it.
- The car was totalled. We're shopping for a new/pre-owned one this weekend.
- I can feel ""quickening,"" i.e. the baby moving. No definitive kicking yet. 
- My too short haircut still disgusts me, although it's definitely longer (and somehow thicker) than it was a couple weeks ago. That doesn't necessarily mean it looks better.
- Aaron came to visit. He and Frank cooked, drank beer, and hung out. They also sang a lot of karaoke. Good times.
- We gave away all our living room furniture and have just a queen-size futon left. The living room is much roomier now. We're also planning a revamp of the two bedrooms to make room for baby.
- Started baby registries. Look us up on <a href=""http://www.babiesrus.com"">Babies R Us</a> and <a href=""http://store.babycenter.com/"">Baby Center Store</a>. Starting the <a href=""http://www.target.com"">Target</a> registry this weekend. Don't know the sex of the baby yet, so I'm holding off on picking out all the clothes until I know (probably in 2 weeks). It's been really fun so far.
- I'm going to Arizona next weekend! Very excited. All I want to do is eat and shop and hang out.

Pictures later, maybe."

FREMONT, Calif. (AP) - A pack of angry Chihuahuas attacked a police officer who was escorting a teenager home after a traffic stop, authorities said.
The officer suffered minor injuries, including bites to his ankle, Detective Bill Veteran said.
The five Chihuahuas escaped the 17-year-old boy's home and rushed the officer in the doorway Thursday, authorities said. The teenager had been detained after the traffic incident.
The officer was treated at a hospital and returned to work less than two hours later."

Random notes: We watched King Kong the other night. It was pretty cool, although inconsiderately long. I have my work Christmas party on Saturday. We're baking cookies on Sunday.

<u>Baby update:</u> (Part of this stuff is probably because of the baby, but it's probably also influenced by the weather, my job, and whatever else. I'll put the cool stuff in bold.) I'm still hungry all the time, but I've started to get heartburn if I eat too much or too quickly. I've been sleeping a lot more, but no matter when I go to bed, I always snap awake by 9 a.m. I can't control it. I've been reading parenting books. They say I should start sleeping on my side, to ensure good circulation to the baby. I'm working on it. <b>My sense of smell is heightened.</b> I wore perfume the other day and it was making me woozy. When I smell food, I can pick up all the subtle parts of it. I've taken to leaving the top button of my pants unbuttoned and just wearing a belt over it to cover it up. My pants fit fine everywhere but the waist, anyway. <b>I thought I felt the baby flutter this morning, but it was only for a moment.</b> The books say I will start to feel little flutterings in the coming weeks. <lj-cut text=""A picture of my belly: 15 weeks"">

//Shoring Up Croatia//
By Andrea Sachs
(c) 2005, The Washington Post
<b>Q: I'd like to travel to Croatia but heard that Dubrovnik is getting touristy. Are there other Dalmatian coast cities you'd recommend? Also, do passenger boats run between Italy and Croatia?</b>
A: As far as European vacations go, Croatia is quickly climbing the ranks. The Croatian National Tourist Office said this year 9 to 10 million people will have visited the former Yugoslavian state, more than twice as many as its population. In addition, the cruise port town of Dubrovnik is the top place to visit among travelers in Croatia. ""Ninety percent of people visiting Croatia go to Dubrovnik,"" said Nena Komarica, general manager of the tourism office's North American branch. ""It's very touristy.""
But don't be scared off. The walled city is considered the ""Pearl of the Adriatic,"" and its forts, palaces, museums and exquisite settings can all be toured by foot. In addition, the Elafiti islands are an easy hop from Dubrovnik, and crowds are rare on the three inhabited islands (bonus: no cars on Lopud).
No matter where you go along the coast, though, you'll bump into tourists, especially if you travel during high season (mid-June to August). But some cities have fewer visitors than Dubrovnik. Komarica recommends Split, Trogir and Zadar, as well as continental Croatia. The country also has more than 1,000 islands, as well as eight national parks. Kornati even mixes the two - it's a national park on an archipelago.
For a less-treaded region, travel north and inland, toward Hungary. This area, says Komarica, ""is not as widely known as the coastline."" Another option is Istria, across the sea from Venice and the largest peninsula in the Adriatic. There, you will find Pula, known for its Roman coliseum, and Rovinj, whose old stone houses are being converted into boutique hotels.
From Italy, a hydrofoil runs from Venice to Pula, Porec, Umag and Rovinj during the summer, and ferries go year-round from Bari to Dubrovnik and Ancona to Zadar and to Split. Info: Croatian National Tourist Office, 800-829-4416, http://us.croatia.hr."

<b>Make Black Friday work: Prepare, get up early, focus</b>
By ABE AAMIDOR
<i>The Indianapolis Star</i>
While you're asleep early Friday morning, perhaps dreaming about all those day-after-Thanksgiving specials you'll find later in the day, people who have worked out their Black Friday shopping plans weeks or months in advance already will be out in force.
Last year, about 130 million Americans went shopping the day after Thanksgiving. They spent an estimated $22.8 billion, about 10 percent of their entire holiday spending, according to Scott Krugman of the National Retail Federation.
For consumers, getting the best deals means having a strategy. Mapping it out takes cunning. It takes guile. It takes a valid credit card.
The game plan
- Prepare. Study newspaper ads, fliers and inserts carefully. Plan which stores you want to hit and when.
- Enlist help. Your significant other might hate to shop, but if you're really going to haul in a lot of merchandise, you'll need help carrying things.
- Gas up. Do you really want to stop for fuel while someone else snaps up the Xbox 360 you so rightfully deserve?
- Get up early, really early. In fact, it might be easier to just stay up all night. If you want to get the best deals, you should be in line no later than 4:30 a.m. No, make that 4 a.m. Uh, 3 a.m.?
- Dress in layers, wear comfortable shoes. Sure, sitting in your car in the Wal-Mart parking lot will warm you up. But will it get you that $99 digital camera? Be prepared for the cold outdoors and the overheated stores.
- Use tunnel vision. Hey, isn't that your Sunday school teacher from 1976? Keep walking. It's a race for the best items. Walk quickly and defensively. No shoving allowed.
- Snack. You'll need your energy. Keep some healthful snacks in your purse or glove compartment. Water, too.
- Be flexible. If the item you want is sold out, look for another brand. Or try another store. Don't waste time arguing with the clerk or a fellow customer.
- Negotiate. The advertised sales price might still be available hours after the early-bird special ends. Just ask.
- Keep looking.
- Friday is only the beginning of the holiday shopping season. Sales will continue for the next month. Who knows, you might find your best bargain Dec. 24."

"event","My first issue of <a href=""http://www.freebuzzonline.com"">Buzz</a> officially came out today. It printed yesterday, so I've already heard all the kudos from my co-workers. I think it turned out really good, for the most part. Except for the screwed up headline on one of the pages, I'm pretty proud of it.

<lj-cut text=""But the real news is that we're having a baby."">

Yes, you read that right. Frank and I went to see the doctor for the first time today. It went really well. Basically, I'm pretty healthy, and all signs point to the baby having a good start. The doctor was really nice. I think we picked the right practice. He did an ultrasound, and I got to see the baby -- even a little heartbeat the size of a pin-prick. Of course, there were tears. I'm really excited! The baby's due in June. According to ""the wheel,"" my due date is June 7, but the ultrasound measured it to be June 11. It would be crazy if we had the same birthday. The best birthday present ever. :)

There's so much to do! Gotta overhaul this whole apartment.

It also postulates that GWB could be responding to a note written to him. It's not like these kind of notes have never been passed before. (Mental image: Ben Franklin at the Continental Congress feeling the call of nature. tee hee.) But it's awesome that this has been documented."

"event","Despite what everyone else tells me, I still believe in the VHS tape. It may not offer all the extra features of the DVD, but that's no reason to consider then obsolete. Sometimes it's simply not necessary to pay the extra money for the DVD. Kids movies, for example. A 3-year-old is not going to care about the extra features in a Wiggles tape, or the enhanced sound quality, so why should a parent shell out the extra for the DVD when they can just get the VHS? Same goes for what I like to call ""background movies"" -- movies I like to put on while I'm doing other things, like folding clothes, doing my nails, or cleaning. They're just films that are fun to watch, e.g., Amelie, Royal Tenenbaums and Under the Tuscan Sun. So those who really know me understand my devotion to VHS and understand my weakness for the previously viewed bin at Hollywood Video. Anyway, all this came up because of this article I found on the wires while I was working tonight. <lj-cut text=""Requiem for VHS""><lj-cut>

<font size=""4"">Requiem for VHS</font>
<b>By Jen Chaney</b>
<i>Special to The Washington Post</i>

WASHINGTON - VHS - the beloved videotape format that bravely won the war against Betamax and charmed millions of Americans by allowing them to enjoy mindless Hollywood entertainment without leaving their homes - has died at the age of 29. It passed away peacefully after a long illness caused by chronic technological insignificance and a lack of director's commentary tracks.

No one knows exactly when this once-valued objet de home entertainment began its journey toward that previously-viewed-video bin in the sky. Some say it was March 1997, when the slimmer, sexier DVD was introduced to American consumers. Others pin the time of death to the week of June 15, 2003, when DVD rentals first topped those of VHS. And there are some - technophobic, time-warped souls - who argue that VHS isn't deceased at all. It's just, well, resting its eyes.

In fairness, the remains of VHS haven't been interred yet. After all, 94.7 million American households still own VCRs. And more than $3 billion was spent on video rentals and purchases in the United States last year, according to Home Media Research. But if VHS isn't quite dead, it's at least on life support, comatose, all industry signs indicating it will not be resuscitated.

Many of the major studios, including Buena Vista Home Entertainment (which issues Disney titles), Fox and Warner Bros., are phasing out VHS releases. Circuit City and Best Buy stopped selling them online earlier this year, having removed the bulky cartridges from their store shelves in 2002 and 2003, respectively. (Wal-Mart and Amazon.com, on the other hand, have not announced plans to stop carrying the tapes.)

""I would think 2006 is the last year that there are major releases on VHS, and there won't be many of those,"" confirms Bo Andersen, president of the Video Software Dealers Association, a trade group for home video retailers.

The following might be the ultimate proof of VHS's demise: When ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" comes to home video on Nov. 1, it will be available only on DVD, marking the first time an installment in the Skywalker saga is not on VHS. As Yoda himself might say, the life of VHS clearly close to ending is.

And while the prevailing attitude toward this turn of events for most might be, ""Gee, that's too bad. So, what has TiVo recorded for me tonight?,"" it's important that we pause to mourn the loss of this clunky cassette and celebrate the many good times we shared. Wait and we might get charged a late fee.

The VCR in our minds slowly rewinds to the early 1980s, when the video rental business first exploded. You may have frequented an independent rental store where the shelves were filled with movies. On one side of the store: all Beta. The other: all VHS.

To continue the ""Star Wars"" geekout: Frequenting the Beta area was a bit like going to the Dark Side. It definitely seemed wrong, but once in Vader's grip, it was difficult to escape. (""The quality is so much better,"" proponents would insist. ""I find your lack of faith disturbing."") Going VHS, on the other hand, was like joining the Rebel Alliance; all the young guns - the Han Solos, the Princess Leias - were there. When VHS eventually triumphed in the mid-'80s, it almost felt like an Ewok celebration. Except it was cooler, as no actual Ewoks were involved.

VHS captivated us because its personality contained so many facets. It was mysterious: How much tape was actually in there? What would happen if you lifted up that plastic flap across the top? If you left a VHS tape on top of the VCR, would it, as your father always insisted, get demagnetized? (You almost sacrificed the household copy of ""Sixteen Candles"" to find out, but in the end, your loyalty to Molly Ringwald won out.) VHS was instructive. It taught us how to feel the burn with Jane Fonda, dance like the zombies from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" and, later, do Tae-Bo with Billy Blanks.

VHS was maddening. No matter how many times we tried to fast-forward to a certain scene - the moment when Leonardo DiCaprio sinks underwater in ""Titanic,"" or the fava beans line in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - it never stopped exactly where we wanted. Inevitably, by the time we hit ""play,"" Leo was already dead and Anthony Hopkins was already saying a breathy ""Chianti.""

And even in this age of DVD saturation, when you imagine someone watching porn, immediately you think: VHS. And recall that black-curtained corner of the video store that was marked ""18 and Over Only,"" with its nervous-looking browsers.

Still, even with its perversions, its personality quirks, you have to feel some love for the VHS tape. Had it never been born, there might not be DVD, or TiVo, or pay-per-view or microwave popcorn. Without it, 29 years' worth of rainy weekends would have dragged on ceaselessly, movielessly.

As we prepare to bury VHS, we can take solace in the knowledge that its memory will live on. In the current clash between the developing high-definition DVD formats Blu-ray and HD-DVD, we will still hear the echoes of VHS vs. Beta. At every yard sale where a neighbor tries to sell us an aging copy of ""When Harry Met Sally"" for $1, we will still see VHS's black, plastic face. And on the streets of Manhattan, wherever bootleg videos are being illegally hawked, the wind will whisper the name: VHS, VHS.

"event","Before I start with the Things I Love and Want to Buy rambling, a note to <lj user=""hungry_driven""> and <lj user=""chibicutie"">: Make sure you pack more than just jeans for when you come here. Pack shorts/skirts and t-shirts/tanks. It's insanely humid (esp. for AZ standards) and you will melt if you wear jeans for walking around in the city. (I learned the hard way in June, and I know August will be hotter.)

Ok, on to the shop talk:

I'm totally insane for the new <a href=""http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/browse.do?nav_keyword=our_collections.american_girl.complete_collection&product_detail_keyword=ag.fragrance_splash_strawberry_cream"">Strawberries & Cream stuff</a> from Bath and Body Works. Seriously, it smells amazing, all warm and sweet and creamy. I've been constantly smelling my arms for the past 48 hours. I'm usually not so into the B&BW stuff -- I think a lot of their scents are too strong -- but this one is wonderful. Go smell it.

Also, I love the new decor stuff at Target. It's all so cute! There are these plastic plates with this starburst pattern in brown, blue, and orange. I fawned all over the display, but I knew that I couldn't bring any more plates home. Frank and I have table service for 12 and it's just the two of us. And then there are the lamps. I've been wanting a new bedside lamp, but I'm holding out for one that I really love. There are a lot of contenders at Target, but nothing that stands out from the others.

Also at Target, there's this mini-backpack that's been on my mind ever since I saw it there yesterday. I found it expensive at first ($20), but after all the thought I've put into it, $20 doesn't seem like so much. I keep imagining all the places I'll go with it. I've inherited my mom's preoccupation with collecting ""for Europe"" accessories. Undoubtedly, everything I own has been put to the ""would it be useful on a trip?"" test. Sunglasses for the streets of Paris/LA, Chacos for the Acropolis/Grand Canyon, backpack to carry my map and water bottle in Rome/New York, etc. Or for everyday use. But of course, it would only be worthy of everyday use if it passes the travel test.

My sunglasses are pretty scratched up from use and from living in my purse, which has turned into a sack of clutter lately. I'd like a new pair, and I'm going to look tomorrow. There was I pair that I liked at T.J. Maxx a couple weeks ago, so maybe there will be more. And on the thread of worn out accessories, my watch has been looking shabby lately. I was thinking my next watch could be something classic like <a href=""http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=7116&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=926&iSubCat=1019&iProductID=7116"">this</a> or <a href=""http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=8066&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=926&iSubCat=1019&iProductID=8066"">this</a>. But I also like <a href=""http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=11753&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=1020&iSubCat=1025&iProductID=11753"">this</a> leather strap one. I think these motion dial ones are cool, too: <a href=""http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=8145&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=926&iSubCat=1019&iProductID=8145"">1</a> and <a href=""http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=8168&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=1020&iSubCat=1027&iProductID=8168"">2</a>. I like <a href=""http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=8134&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=926&iSubCat=1019&iProductID=8134"">this gold one</a> to match my ring on my left hand. But I'm afraid it might look too dressy to wear all the time.

So yeah, I've been preoccupied with accessories lately. I'm not particularly interested in and clothes right now, but I've been on a lookout for a good brown polo like <a href=""http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10901&storeId=10051&parentCategoryId=12203&childCatgroupId=12249&categoryId=12249&productId=225072&colorString=Dark%20Brown&langId=-1"">this one</a> from Abercrombie. I'm all about chocolate brown lately.

That's enough of my rambling. I'm going to go finish Harry Potter 4 and go to bed. Tomorrow: Buy backpack, look for sunglasses, pack for weekend (Eagles training camp and Philly), go to work."

In my rush to get out of the house, I left my Harry Potter book, so now I have nothing to do. :( I was at a really good part in the book too...

Last night's episode of Laguna Beach felt really short. I was spoiled by the hour-long season premier. Still have a big crush on that Jason kid, even though he is clearly bad news for Jessica. I don't understand why they're even together. He really doesn't seem that into her, even though that part at the end was really sweet. Kristen is still annoying, Alex H. is still boring, all the other girls are dumb (esp. that new girl), and LC and Stephen are totally hooking up.

They were so cute and awkward on their little date. It's definitely not going to last. I wasn't really excited about this season, but now that I've seen this episode, I'm hooked again. I'm still rooting for LC and Stephen, and I'm sick of Kristen already. I'm glad they brought in new people. I find Talan really boring. Still love Lo; Morgan and Christina are still meh. They're like Kristin's friend ""Alex H."" who they haven't made part of the cast -- even though she's around all the time -- because she has no screen appeal.

p.s. Veronica Mars is being re-aired Friday nights at 8 on CBS. WATCH IT!"

I have to go to work today. I don't really feel like it, but I know that the sooner I go in, the earlier I can leave. I just don't want to be the only person there. I'm thinking I could wait until the desk people come in.

It's laundry time."

"event","Our birth date describes who we are, what we are good at and what our inborn abilities are. It also points to what we have to learn and the challenges we are facing.

To figure out your Birth Number, add all the numbers in the birth date together, like in the example, until there is only one digit. A Birth Number does not prevent you from being anything you want to be, it will just color your choice differently and give you a little insight.



Example March 20, 1950

3 + 20 + 1950 = 1973

1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20

2 + 0 = 2



Keep going until you end up with a single digit number. 2 is the Birth Number to read for the birth date in the example.

<lj-cut text=""What's your number?""><lj-cut>

.. 1 - THE ORIGINATOR

1 's are originals. Coming up with new ideas and executing them is natural. Having things their own way is another trait that gets them as being stubborn and arrogant. 1's are extremely honest and do well to learn some initiative and are often leaders or bosses, as they like to be the best. Being self-employed is definitely helpful for them. Lesson to learn Others' ideas might be just as good or better and to stay open minded

..2 - THE PEACEMAKER

2 's are the born diplomats. They are aware of others' needs and moods and often think of others before themselves. Naturally analytical and very intuitive they don't like to be alone. Friendship and companionship is very important and can lead them to be successful in life, but on the other hand they'd rather be alone than in an uncomfortable relationship. Being naturally shy they should learn to boost their self-esteem and express themselves freely and seize the moment and not put things off.

Famous 2's Bill Clinton, Madonna, Whoopee Goldberg, Thomas
Edison,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.



.. 3 - THE LIFE OF THE PARTY

3's are idealists. They are very creative, social, charming, romantic, and easygoing. They start many things, but don't always see them through. They like others to be happy and go to great lengths to achieve it. They are very popular and idealistic. They should learn to see the world from a more realistic point of view!

.. 5 - THE NONCONFORMIST

5's are the explorers. Their natural curiosity, risk taking, and enthusiasm often land them in hot water. They need diversity, and don't like to be stuck in a rut. The whole world is their school and they see a learning possibility in every situation. The questions never stop. They possibility in every situation. The
questions never stop. They are well advised to look before they take action and make sure they have all the facts before jumping to conclusions.

..7 - THE INTELLECTUAL

7's are the searchers. Always probing for hidden information, they find it difficult to accept things at face value. Emotions don't sway their decisions. Questioning everything in life, they don't like to be questioned themselves. They're never off to a fast start, and their motto is slow and steady wins the race. They come across as philosophers and being very knowledgeable, and sometimes as loners. They are technically inclined and make great researchers uncovering information. They like secrets. They live in their own world and should learn what is acceptable and what not in the world at large.

exude their decisions on their own needs rather than on what others want.

..9- THE PERFORMER

9's are natural entertainers. They are very caring and generous, giving away their last dollar to help. With their charm, they have no problem making friends and nobody is a stranger to them. They have so many different personalities that people around them have a hard time understanding them. They are like chameleons, ever changing and blending in. They have tremendous luck, but also can suffer from extremes in fortune and mood. To be successful, they need to build a loving
foundation.

Famous 9's Albert Schweitzer, Shirley MacLaine, Harrison Ford, Jimmy Carter, Elvis Presley

"event","So I should probably write something re: my birthday in NYC before I forget all about it. Here it is in one long paragraph: There were a few great parts, mostly good parts, and some really miserable parts. First of all, it was so wonderful to see everyone again. It was cool to see New York through Tuan-Anh's eyes. He was like me on my first time there, taking a million pictures. (Another great part that I noticed later: I like his camera's pictures -- I look skinny in them! I'm never throwing these jeans away.) Also, Frank, Sarah, and I went to see a musical: Altar Boyz, which was hilarious. And I caught up with some Backstreet Boys fans camping out for a CD signing at Virgin Megastore. And it's always so great to stay at my aunt's house. We got to take a dip in the pool, and she made barbecue the way I like it: shrimp and mushroom skewers. The coolest place I went on this trip: a bar in the village where Dylan Thomas died. Possibly sitting in the actual room. It was an awesome bar on top of that, cheap food and drink, A/C. It was fun walking around, but after a while we just got tired and the weather was really hot and humid. The worst parts of the trip were the weather, the Puerto Rico Day Parade (which really sucks if you don't want to be there) and not getting to do any shopping. But also, our bank account has been depleted, so it's a good thing I got paid yesterday. That's pretty much it for the highlights. I'm going to upload pictures to <a href=""http://photos.yahoo.com/haylmerri"">my Yahoo album</a> now. Check it out if you want. Look for me in my Lucky jeans.

Other things going on:
<li>My growing addiction to Blue Diamond roasted almonds.
<li>I have a bunch of new stuff I'm working on at work. Next week's going to be exciting and different, I feel.
<li>I loved the Rachel McAdams/Ryan Gosling kiss at the MTV awards. I give the rest of the show a C. Jimmy Fallon is just not funny to me.
<li>I'm jealous of everyone who's traveling this summer! My vacation wasn't long enough."

"event","So having a month off from school isn't new to me but having a month off from the first semester that i actually gave a fuck about is. I was able to read and finish a book that i wanted to read in just two days because of my appreciation for this and i am about to finish another that i started this past winter but then put down in order to pick up two other books that interested me but were also part of my sociology and art appreciation curriculum. I'm anticipating my grades that i won't find out until around tuesday and i hope the combination of two A's and two mystery grades bring my GPA up enough to where i will no longer need to have monthly meetings with the both the academic adviser and my program adviser, though i never really minded the meetings that i had with my program adviser since he actually was interested in my future. He gave me confidence out the wazoo with his encouraging words that told me that i am basically great. I might act all tough and confident, which i am on another level, but i haven't had an authority figure of no relation to me really give me props for my ability to overcome while at the same time, do so creatively, ever. So that's my personal, needful gratitude leaking out. I'm also anticipating this fall when i will actually start working with graphic design programs and also writing and photographing for the school paper. A mediocre feat i know, but a new experience all the same.

So i am learning new things alot lately. Academically, worldly, and personally. I have figured out that girls that openly say that they have a problem ""trusting other girls"" are not very trust worthy. In fact, put into some sort of retrospective light, they are the ones that will stab you in the back, metaphorically speaking ofcourse, but with an almost respectable precision. Respectable because it shows utter selfishness. And i have to say that i am somewhat relieved. I no longer have to worry about or care about anyone other than myself and those that are actually ""real."" I have somehow managed to push out every aspect of my life prior to my new outlook that could ever bring me down. Because they say you can judge a woman by the company she keeps, the last thing i want around is facades of any sort. I have always prided myself in being brutally honest and i want to remain that when the situation arises. I'd rather people just tell me if i suck to them than to have to find out in a very rude way where maturity is lacking. Pity, you would think after years of ""bonding"" it would have been a little bit more of a romantic end than crossing the line into wishes of my current profession suffering. All i have to say is God bless those that teach us how not to be."

"event","today, worst day, sorta, ever. First of all my manager tells me he's going to be out of town tomorrow, but fails to inform about today. I'm always an hour late on Fridays and Saturdays when i know, or presume, he's there. So i call him around 3:15 to give him the normal just checking in to let you know i'm not in a ditch somewhere courtesy (he tends to call and say that he was just making sure that is not where i was)and he is all like ""i'm not in town, i told you about me taking off."" For the record he mentioned nussin about today, just tomorrow, but then again i didn't ask so maybe it is my bad. So i practically hang up on him in order to rush out the door towards the theatre thankfully only five minutes away. Get to work, and the weekly closing stuff is only about 85% done so i had to rush around to the bank, which i was informed he visited only hours prior, then back to theatre to make copies of game reports that as it turned out i made the wrong copies of, then to the post office, all wondering why this girl was not there and stressing that i would have to run box as well as projection because i assumed that it would just be my luck for someone not to show on this day. I'm home now, but work was sucky with a capital suck all day. My only relief was Becky and i went to an invitation only bar opening downtown. It was an open bar for just one hour but i feel we got as much as we could in in that small amount of time. Plus i got to see my friend Darcy whom i haven't seen in a while. So yay. Now back to my regularly scheduled program of packity packing."

"event","alright, i haven't wrote in this thing for what is a while, well except for a few cryptic and day to day stuff, mostly set on private to spare all like 5 people the emotional BS that i sometimes feel. but whatever, i'm back. i need to express my feelings more, get in touch with myself, all that. so here i go again on my own, going down the only road i've ever known. like a drifter i was born to walk alone. and i've made up my mind, i ain't wastin no more time, here i go again. white snake is silly, but who's going to argue? tonight went over to Kevin's to hang out with Thunderchief while they recorded their demo. it sounds pretty good and i got to the some of the anthem yells on ""mess with the best."" I also had an idea to say ""rock and roll"" in a sultry voice at the same time Adam does and they liked that, we did it fucking multiple times because David kept forgeting that i was doing more than yelling and in the end because of whatever it didn't turn out as good as it sounded on the first take and Ben Bone proceeds to call me a retarded orphan. Funny, yes, but he was being kind of a dick to everyone at the end of the night in my opinion. He just HAD to get back to that shit hole called Gumby's. Whatever, i just hope he gets off his dick wagon before he moves into the house in a couple of months. I got enough personal feelings getting hurt unknowingly everyday to deal with my friends/roommate doing the same thing and having to keep that to myself as well. Yes i admit it, i can be sensitive, but in retrospect, i was in a fragile position at the time. So i take that back, i'm only sensitive when in that position. Sunday i shall be moving into my new spectacular house on *gasp* the east side. I can deal with that considering i will be about five minutes closer to school and the house is going to be so kick ass. House shows, a huge yard to play football and have slip and slides, a huge basement which is actually a full apartment, and there's  a little area that is going to be my ""studio."" Not really a lab since i don't think there is much ventilation in that part of the house, but more like a place to hang fabric and work on portrait projects. I'm pretty excited. My moving team is going to be manly and strong which is great because i got stuff and am going to be getting more on moving day. Another couch and chair from my aunt and i think another t.v. from moms. Team Move Sara so far: David, Bryan, Wes, Will, and Trey after 5 if needed. Good stuff. I really wish that i had offered to give David a ride to work when i dropped him off a few hours ago. He's probably walking right now with only a couple of hours of sleep holding him up. I didn't think about it and now i'm sorry for not considering him for the first time in what seems like ever, but now i feel bad. It sucks that i have to work all day at the theatre Saturday. Stupid upid work. I hope i don't miss too much of the show. I wanted to take some pictures of Community Chaos because they need new ones, microphone cables and stands are unflattering. But i'll see since i won't be able to get out there until 11 or 1130. :( I need to pack more and then go to bed. Hopefully i'll keep up with this more. This is for me so if anyone reads this, don't. It's silly. It's for me. But i can't stop you. Oh and i hope Jeff keeps me as his friend in more ways than just this. It was good to hang out with him those weeks ago. It was good to talk to someone about life. I'm never too good at analyzing myself because my views change so often, but he was the first one that i was vocal about my new outlook with and it felt good to speak my mind about life even if it was all jumbled up since it has been so long. I don't know if it's school going semi decently or me moving or what but i have a pretty positive outlook on everything as of now. I can't say that i have let go of my regrets  or past completely, but i am accepting that this is the way it is and i am slowly clawing my way out. The point is that i'm trying. The End."

But mainly so that I could go out to the pool around 10 to get some sun on my face, since I am pale and all. But NOOO, today had to be a cloudy day, the first one all week from what I can remember. But I wait around for the sun to come out since the weather report said partly cloudy. To kill time I watched Milo and Otis, read the book on serial killers Nate let me borrow, dillydallied on the computer, ate some Bagel Bites, and did other stuff, but still no sun. So I decide to say fuck it and take a bath. As soon as I got dressed and went outside to have a cigarette, low and behold, Mr. Sunshine all over the place. Typical I say.

The book that I am reading on serial murderers throughout history has gotten me looking at what most would call ""normal people,"" and wondering if they hold dark secrets in their basement. It's pretty funny sometimes. I asked one guy just for the hell of it if he had a basement. He was all like Yeah!, how'd you know? I got it set up pretty sweet, you should check it out sometime. I declined and told him that I was asking for a school project: seeing how many people had basements and how many had attics. Weird.

Electric Eel Shock is playing in Atlanta at The Earl on Monday. I am so going, but I can't find anyone to go with me, considering that everyone I asked so far is either under 21, or just plain can't. Sucky. I'll go by myself since I don't know when the next time they are going to be around here, but would much rather not if I can help it. 
Hmmm... Well, off to work.

Well, there was a part towards the end about how you never die if you carry yourself on with your children. That somehow got me thinking about how I always (well, not always) said that I feel no need to procreate, that when I am ready to have children that I will just adopt. But at the same time I couldn't help but realize that I do want to eventually see a innocent part of myself within someone else.  Does this make me part of the masses? Am I conforming to something that I swore I would never become? If I am, then I feel less pressure, that's for sure. The fact is that I never want to die."

Then you have some sort of revelation, realize certain errors of your ways, forgive those that have done you wrong (while setting them straight on the degree that their wrongs that have caused you in great pain that became malice ill-willingly directed). You see that what you believe in the most can tear you apart in the most treacherous way (making everything else that you thought was true turn against you in a form of poetic justice). What would it be like if you didn't believe in Karma? 

You didn't want to speak sometimes in fear of being viewed as a victim or sometimes stupid. But because of loss on account of those very defenses, you notice that you are neither. You're actions are what made you stupid, and your words, well, if you had spoken up then, then you would have never been victimized. And now you no longer cry for yesterday, but what has come from so many of them coming together to make today. Those that look in the rear view for too long always end up having a collision with what is ahead of them.

Now that I am done speaking third person...

I took the time to read all my entries that I have made in the past months that I have had this online journal and I see that a majority of the time I was lying to myself, and to most anyone that took the time to read it. I'm sure I have been the source of amusement to some and heartache to others if they do infact believe that emotions expressed online could actually be substantial and honest. I thought they were at one point, and at others they were just a letter left unaddressed to those they concerned. How could I take myself so seriously? So here comes the pain (the truth to whom it may concern). The ""Jew"": thank you for your concern and the way that you always wanted to save me. I know your intentions were always with my happiness in mind, but I am over you, and you are over me, and no matter if you are the man that would still kill for me, I am no longer the little girl that would die for you, and I know that you'd rather have never known me. The ""young'un"": I still believe that you are the most beautiful inside and out that I have ever known, even if you don't believe it. But it was wrong of me to ever keep a hold on you. I could relate to what you felt for me because of what I had felt at one point for the Jew and to me that was the purest most unconditional love and I didn't want to lose that. But my intentions were selfish, and perhaps I just viewed you as a possession, something that I had conquered, and I am sorry for that, and all the pain that I have caused you. You are going to make someone so happy and you deserve all the happiness that will come to you  when you are not expecting it, but I expect it in full for you. And to my ""tangerine"": forgive me for the way I acted the day before and the days before that, and the year before that. Even though you say that you had been thinking about it for whatever while you had, I know that it was that one night that was the deciding point. I'm sorry that you saw me in that state. I should have never put you in that position. But you never gave me the opportunity to say I am sorry in the way that you should have understood and and cared about. I should have probably opened up more than what I did. Now, because of you, I have been humbled, yet today, finally feel better about what you have taught me, and I am  so glad that I had the time I did with you. You have made me want to be a better person, and I thank you for that. And once again I thank you for being you, and loving me when you did.  You are going to be some thing greater than even what you are now. And you too, deserve every good thing that comes your way. But what do you care?

Now I am going to sleep, and maybe eat tomorrow."

Well I did everything that I was planning on today. Hair- short(er). Jewelry- obtained (wasn't that bad, thanks Randy). I should feel good about the newness; the change from what I was. (what was I?) His stuff is still bagged up, waiting in my car. The 5 that was a 7 became a 6, or so he said. Damn I need sleep. Figured out today every tattoo that I'm ever going to get, well, until I think of more.

I'm about to leave to get my hair chopped off. Change is good. Change is good. Change is good. Change is good. Change is good. Yeah, I'll just tell myself that. Big ups yo (what?) to Miller and Collins for making me feel better. I don't really know why I hit that guy. Oh yeah I do: he was talking shit to the guy that is doing my tattoo tomorrow, he ended up grabbing me by the throat, and I was drunk and heartbroken and wanted to make someone feel my pain somehow. 

A little more than 12 hours ago he crept his goodbyes past me with no real explanation: just cliche excuses. And I just sat there clutching a paisley pillow while wanting so bad to get on my knees and tell him that I need him, that I should have made that clear before, yet feel that there is something that I am not being told. 

I had made so many plans in my head for the future, for our future, and now there's nothing. Just his stuff bagged up, his picture taken down, and my still swollen red eyes. Blah blah blah blah....emo emo emo. Who fucking cares."

For some reason I was so jealous I could have ripped apart their faces just to tell them not to keep going on about what I had missed. They said Cedric was doing a James Brown dance and moving around more than ever witnessed by them; that's not saying much perhaps. But I have never actually seen him move in front of me at all.

Nothing too exciting; sat around for a bit, then went home. I think I want to rearrange the furniture here where I live and maybe get some new plants. It is time I just went ahead and gave up on the plants that I have now. I have failed at maintaining a healthy garden that I have moved around just too much. They almost die, then I bring them back to life over and over. Perhaps I should just let them go. I hope I can get a desk this Thursday. I'm getting sick of sitting on a blanket on the floor. My back ends up killing me after a while. Heh, I'm old. But a desk along with my car payment, as well as Lizz's bowl, and a ticket for the SOAD and Mars Volta show Friday would pretty much wipe me out. I need a raise now!

"event","Watching Star Wars for the third time tonight after hours at the theatre. Watched March of the Penguins the other day. I liked it, but got teary eyed when a ""late"" penguin died (or disappeared as Morgan Freeman put it) You see him (the penguin) stumbling through the chunky ice, alone, because he was late for the march. The temperature had already dropped a considerable amount in just a day or so, and because of this, and loss of direction, he had no hope. A few other penguins ""disappeared"" in the documentary, but that one was alone when it happened, and that made me incredibly sad.

Importing all my music from CD onto my computer has come to be a neverending redundant task. I already have 4 days of music stored but am not even a third of the way through my CDs. But I have come up with 31 genres so far. My favorites are ""art metal"", ""deathpunk"", ""skate metal"", and ""true hardcore"". 

Hung out with Jeffrey today at Beechwood while he did projection; their projectors are so much nicer than the ones we have here, and the projection booth is so much cooler. It's like a huge maze. I wanna play hide and seek there. We decided that we're going to try to fly out to Colorado to see James, hopefully in early September. Neither of us has ever been on a plane so it'll be a new experience for us both. The last time I went out to Colorado, I was 18, and I fell down a flight of stairs. I still believe that along with my two broken toes, bruised ribs, and fucking up my left side in general, I cracked my femur (is that how you spell it? The big bone in your leg). I probably should have went to the doctor. To this day I can press down on that area of my leg and it still feels bruised.

Still though, Johnny Depp is the best actor of my generation, hands down. I have never read the book, so it may very well be how the story was originally told, but Tim Burton really seems to be hung up on the father-son relationship since his father died. But a man that's as in love with Johnny Depp as I am can do no wrong. I wish that I had been on some kind of hallucinogen though. But I'll save that for The Corpse Bride."

"event","Yeah, so this point of view pisses off alot of people, but, fuck 'em... 

The other day I had a conversation that turned into a heated debate with my mother about how I have no desire what so ever to have any offspring. She said that she just couldn't understand how I didn't feel any instinct what so ever to have a child of my own. I had to explain to her that because of being a twenty-four year old woman having been raised on red meat injected with large amounts of hormones, I do, but by the year 2050 (before the end of what should be my natural life) there is going to be about 11 billion people on this planet that will no longer have the resources to sustain that amount of lives. And to make the conscious decision NOT to bring more mouths to feed into this world is a good thing considering that I myself will probably never make any sort of positive contribution into a society that I have come to hate, yet am aware that I am probably the epitome of. An American society, that for the most part, because of their christian upbringings, believes that life is a miracle (6 billion or so miracles?) as opposed to just the mixing of chemicals, the coincidental chance brought on by youth becoming sexually active and liberated by the age of 14. Parents tell their 16 year old daughters to wait for ""Mr. Right,"" but allow their 12 year old daughters to wear make-up and short shorts with words like ""juicy"" on the ass. But that's acceptable, because as long as the daughter goes to church every Sunday, and her parents are still married and are Georgia alumni, ""she's a nice girl."" Oh yeah, and has anyone noticed the 'help stop child molestation' charity boxes at random convenience stores that have the picture of the guy in court, I guess on child molestation charges, (which is very, very wrong) but next to him the picture of a little blond haired girl looking to be about the age of four with her shirt off and her hair blowing in the wind while she points at you to help stop the bad men from touching her. Maybe the bad men wouldn't want to touch her if her parents didn't allow her to be portrayed so inappropriately, almost seductive. Well anyways the debate went on for probably an hour or so about how I just could not relate to how every kind of person that I witness everyday will not pull them selves out of the must breed to live on mindset. You have the self proclaimed educated ones that actually believe that to procreate is a good idea for carrying on their ""good family names,"" their good genes, and so that their money has somewhere to go after they die. Then you have the pieces of shit that do not have the will or education to get them selves out of the rut of history repeating itself, and either have children to collect a check, or to keep a man somehow tied to them. And what if eventually they overcome their need for him? Well then, they just resent that child; so the child grows up feeling inadequate. Which could lead to the other group of people that I have witnessed: people that have enough, financially and emotionally, but desire more, and while feeling that they no longer have purpose in their lives, they determine that the only way to find it is by creating another life to make up for there short comings. But, what if they fail, and that child does not do all the great things that the parent had hoped. Then what? Just more lives to create more lives. My mom shut up then. I guess I won. My point was this: there are so many kids that need homes here in the U.S. and overseas, why can't people adopt more and breed less? How many years of evolution? But we still act like monkeys."

A tanker full of gasoline tipped over, probably because the driver decided that he could maneuver the truck in the mall only/no trucks lane (but I don't really know the details) and spilled the flammable liquid far enough that you weren't aloud anywhere near the mall. I ended up having to get onto the loop just to find that every exit was backed up with other people that had to go the same route. Long story short, I refuse to sit in traffic if I can help it and I had to put roughly 35 miles on my car while going up and down the loop and through my old stomping ground, Oconee County. 

Today we said goodbye. We'll speak again in a month. I know what's going to happen. I always knew. Note to self: obsession nor infatuation is in fact ""love"".

I had been anticipating it since I found out they had started filming last year, and I have to say that I was not disappointed what so ever. A few facts were jumbled up, but most everything seemed to match up with the documentary. Did I mention that Emile Hirsh is hot? He was shirtless and pissed off almost the entire movie, and that brought a smile to my face. 

The Jeff Glenn birthday/Community Chaos reunion show Friday was fucking awesome. I haven't had that good of a time at a show in so long. All the bands were great, everybody (and I mean everybody) came out, and I was somewhat hearing impaired for about a day and a half afterwards. Good times. I'm really glad Jeff had such a good time. His birthday last year sucked because of me. So it's only right that this year he had ten times the normal birthday fun. Hooray for karma!

I can't really say that I was as devastated as others there, but being surrounded by mourning people seems to take a toll on you. You start to think you are sad when, in actuality, you are there out of respect. Then people come up to you with there red puffy eyes, knowing that they weren't too close to the deceased, beyond casual acquaintances, and ask you how you are holding up. Then during the actual service it turns into a 'who wants to accept JC into their hearts' sermon. 
But I got to hear 'keep on loving you' by REO Speedwagon, which was kick ass in the way that it was appropriate because this lady was a fan. I have to admit that I do like that song. Also got to see some birds set free. I like the symbolism in that. 
I also started thinking today about how I would want my funeral. I hope if I am outlived by the members of my family that would put the shindig together, they don't get a preacher or a rabbi or any other kind of religious person to deliver any kind of message. I'd rather have random friends get up and talk shit about me while awesome music is playing in the background. But the bird thing is cool.

today i got up at 2 and i went shopping with my mom.  I got lots and lots of food.  I went to work and told jorge that i ate my fish he was laughing so hard! lol 
should i buy another one?  

when i got home i did nothing till 11 and then i went and ran around the block by me next to me by lisa and behind me.  In total 30 mins.  I'm doing this to get back in shape for ice hockey.  

Friday i am getting my ice skates that will be $500 plus a hockey stick about $170-$200!  Maybe cheap gloves about 150.

Right now my stomach hurts.  If i didn't shit him out It might be b/c of the fish that I ate.

Well let me tell you about that.  You know how Steve-O ate a fish and then threw him up?  Exactly what i Attempted to do.  Thats right I failed.  I barely threw up i don't know how he did it but I give him props!

I also found out that one of the reasons i haven't been able to fall asleep is b/c of the waves that are in the computer and t.v. screen.  This keeps you up and is harder to do activities and stuff like that.

have a nice day

We then went to Bed Bath Beyond and i got new sheets for my bed. and a new pillow.  I tried to switch one of those shitty pillows for one of the really expensive ones but it didn't have a price tag on it and i had to get a new one.  My Money bag is on the way.

"event","yesterday when i had to wake up at 10 am to go to work I was fine.  Ihad some cookies and a dunken dounut.  After that it was time for ice hovkey.  Finally i waited so long for it to start up again.  On the way there i had a # 6 spicy  chicken upsized (big mistake).  When we got there My coach goes I expect you to work the hardest b/c i didn't pick you for this team!  I said I was alrdy suppose to be on this team b/c all of the members of the midget minor B team are supopose to move up together!  Then, he quickly shut up and i went to in the locker room.  I had my skates sharpened and then 

we had a team meeting.  Again he sharts with this bullshit how i'm not suppose to be on the team.  He makes me sound like i suck (which i don't!)  
When we got on the ice I was rusty just like everone else.  Even worse for me b'/c of my late night and my #6.  A couple of the members on my team no that i'm not a fuck up player and say he's an idiot.  Carl is not like the coach i had last year.  Maybe if i'm lucky this guy will teach me something!  We started to skate around but i was so tired.  I'm acting as if i was jrunk out there b/c i was so tired, except it wasn't an act.  

When I left i was so tired and me and my dad talked about how rusty i was and what to do to stay in shape.  He said that i should run.  SO this morning at 3 16 i woke up and i went running for about a half an hour.  Now i am typing this and tired so i'm going to sleep.
goodnight

I usually go to sleep at 5 a.m. and wake up at 2 p.m. 

I was suppose to go to bari's but instead i went to the rec to play hockey.  WASTE OF MY TIME!  me and alex are the only ones that went.  Whenever i go nobody is down there.  Manalapan has a lot of good hockey players but most of them are all dicks.  

Right now i have 3 little fans in my room b/c i don't have a ceiling fan in this room yet.  one fan is mine the other is for the tv rfoom and the other one is for my dads office in the basement.  I'm going to keep the fans until they get me my own.  They used to turn the ac on until i told my dad that at night i put it at 65! lol

I'm waiting for ash to say shes sorry.  I really just don't get it how shes so mad at me b/c i call her and asking her to call me back.  I really don't want to loss a good friend.  well thats what we were until her camp started.

Anyway

We went to see King Aurthur! it sucked.  In the movie this girl with this bush of hair through a STARBURST AT ME!  Did i mind? NOPE!  ONly because it was red, but it it was orange idk what would happen.

At the mall we walked around a lot.  I wanted to go into the Christian Store to get a new Cross but it's no longer there. :( 

We walked and walked and WALKED! Finally I got something to eat.  As I was eating Em called her mom to pick us up and then she asked if we wanted to go out to eat.  Which really sucked! After that we walked to some other stores.  

When we got picked u we went to video home center and got butterfly effect.  We went to her house but didn't watch it but watched Freddy Vs. Jason  Every 5 secs Emily kept falling asleep.  I left at around 11.

it has just come to my attention that a couple of my fellow friends have SMOKED THE REEFER!  now it doesn't sound like a big deal but let  me just tell you the story. well call her F1 and the seconded friend F2.  Now F1 was over some1's house and was like yea i smoked pot and it was so much fun.  THAt was lyk last year.  F1 also told me that she wouldn't get addicted.  Recently F2 and a bunch of her friends smoked the reefer together.  Now  i just got off the fone with F2 and she said I'm not going to get addicted.  now isn't that wat F1 said?  And F1 has done it a lot lyk 10 times. 

Anyway,  I have moved past that b/c they are changing to rapidly.  and by the end of the summer they will all be pot heads just like every1 in Country roads and be calling me DUDE with every sentence that comes from there mouth.  Its LIKE THE FUCKING PLAGUE!

the new friendships-- Ash & Pap

I've joined up with an Adult roller hockey team called The Generals.  Yesterday I got new wheels and barings.  when I came back I was surprised to find PAP at my front door.  I invited them in and after 30 mins my mother walked in to find ash and pap on my bed.  she didn't hesitate to say GET OUTTA MY HOUSE!  so they left and went to paps psychologist.

Ash and dana visited me at work.  They went in the tent and dana got a soccer ball. 

when I got home lisa started up again.  Shes rele mad about what she did to her friends and said she was sorry.  But, u can't undo what has been done.

actaully, i was thinking about forgiving her but she butts in where she shouldn't.  and b/c of that she almost cost me and josh our best friend.  

right now i'm on the fone with dana and ash.  dana is sleeping over her house.

The mexicans that work in the store go up on the ladders and drop the boxs from 6ft in the air on purpose.  people in Odd-Job always tare the products open and for no reason and then throw it on the ground.  When it's time to clean up it takes everyone forever.  People stay 10 mins after we close, And when we tell them to leave they usually stay longer.

Well its easy money and i usually just walk around and do nothing anyway.  The thing that sucks the most is working the night shift b/c i miss out on the stuff i want to do the most.

"event","when i woke up today i called ash.  I talked to lisa and she decided that she would give me a second chance, but i'm not the one that needs a second chance b/c it was her stupidity to even bring up being friends.  As i think to myself i'm wondering if we do infact have a relationship and we would get into an argument about nothing would she break up with me?  I'm not really sure if we should go about with this anyway.  I feel that she wants more from me than what i would like to give.  WHen i told alex all of this he quickly replied with: ""So she wants you to put a quarter in for another hour.""  Again he thinks that this trial run is stupid.  

Well its 4:34 now and i just got off the phone with ash.  My mom just got a stair lift.  She has arthritis in her legs and it takes her a couple of mins to get up the stairs.  It doesn't go very fast and not very fun.  

Anyway,  I have to get ready for work now.

WTF WHY SATURDAY!?!?! i said.  she replied with , ""I LIKE TO BE SUSPENSEFULL."" who needs suspense!?!?!  Josh was lyk u might as well tell him.  I was lyk, ""i told you more important things and you can't tell me this little thing wtf?""  Then she says, ""Josh ur gay! I don't think i'm going to hang out with you josh and alex tommorrow it'll be gay!""  JOsh says YOU NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRRIOR B/C UR BEING A HYPOCRITE.  Why WON'T YOU FUCKING TELL US?!""  Lisa Replies with a stupid remark, ""B/c Then he wins.""  rele i win.  what am i winning a medel?! i hope its gold.

"event","today at lyk 12:00 in the morning i was on the fone with josh & lisa.  Lets just say it wasn't a good time and keep it at that. alex doesn't like lisa.  he thinks that this trial run is a fucking game.  Either it works or it doesn't.  There's no refunds! i don't come with a reciet!

i woke up around 11 called josh and then alex.  We went to the mall and then to joshs house.  at josh's we were attacked.  By what?  If you must know IT WAS THE CRAZY FLY.  That bitch hurts and if you ever see one you gotta scream ""AHHHHHHH! CRAZY FLY!!!""  People will know what to do.  

But, anyway after that i got home watched some bang bus.  Bang BUs is the best porn you can ever watch.  it's comedy and porn in one sitting and is about 1hr long.  

and then i made this live journal.  flipsider is footbag website.  and 833 is my member number. 

i hope you all have a good summer even though i really don't mean it.  I just needed a good ender.

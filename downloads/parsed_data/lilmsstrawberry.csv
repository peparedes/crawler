Well last Saturday I went to the Langlow's and the Trippe's lake house. It was fun! I tubed like 5 times for 2 hours each and my arms hurt so bad!! and we came back Sunday night. 

Then yesterday was the 4th! I went downtown to watch the fireworks. They were pretty boring... so then Matt, Marty, SJ, Erin, Margaret, Nick Z, Leigh Ellen, Scott, and Me walked down to Overton park and the guys shot fireworks. LE and me were like fearing for our lives we would like run in the middle of it! lol! and then Lake came but me and LE had to leave. So I went home, but it was fun anyways. 

Well comment and say something! love ya!

Wednesday night - I went to say bye to all the Young Life ppl who were going to Southwind. I was so depressed. I should have gone. :( Then me, ali, and michelle went and ate at California Pizza Kitchen. Then we stayed the night at Michelle's house.

Thursday - I woke up and went home and babysat my brothers, and at 1 I went to the SGA rep meeting. Then that night I went to the SGA cook-out at Joy Lampkin's house, and then Virginia spent the night.

Friday - We kept my brothers until 11 when we went to the mall. After that we came home, changed clothes, and then went to the pool. That night at like 6 I think, I went to babysit these 2 little girls. 

Saturday - I went to the mall with my mom to get my dad a father's day present, and after that I came home and layed out for a little while.

Sunday - And this morning I layed out, and then went to my brother's all-star game and now I'm at home.

I've known him since the day I was born, and he better come back to visit me! Well then I went to ACE, and then to church for my Choir Tour interview. Then Ginia came and picked me up and we went to the lake! Which was really fun! I got sunburned! Ouch! Then we spent like all day trying to figure out what to do last night. And nothing was working out! so we went to the mall, and then to her Grandparent's house to play golf and watch American Idol!

**Then when we were ready to leave we were like ""Let's go to Sonic and get slushies!"" and so it took like 10 extra minutes. Then when we got on the highway there was a really bad wreck that had just happened b/c the police and firemen were just getting there. But that could have been us!! I guess by me and Virginia craving a slushies our lives were saved by God. 

***Then I got a phone call from my mom saying that I needed to come home and not spend the night with Virginia b/c my grandfather was having an open heart surgery called an arterier gram and b/c of his age it's possible that he would not make it. So I came home, and I am waiting for the call to see how it went!

>>>I am God! Today I will be handling all your problems.

PLEASE remember that I do not NEED your help.

If the Devil happens to deliver a situation that you

DO NOT attempt to resolve it.

Kindly put it in the SFJTO (something for Jesus to do) box

It will be addressed in MY TIME, not yours.

Once the matter is placed in the box

DO NOT hold on to it or attempt to remove it.

Holding on, or removal, will delay the resolution of your problem.

If it is a situation that you think you are capable of handling,

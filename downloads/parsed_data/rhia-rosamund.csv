"event","I have been feeling really out of the loop recently.  Partially because when I work overnights I have next to no time at home, barely enough to sleep, shower, and grab some food.  But I think there's more to it than that.  Just a nagging feeling.  And the not-so-great thing is that I no longer care as much.  Soon I may not care at all.  It bugs me that I don't have enough time for my horse and my husband, but as for the rest, oh well.  I am content to bury myself in my work and my own solitary life.  With my new project, I feel like some sacrifices will be required, but if it means missing out on some things, oh well - it will be oh-so-worth-it in the long run.  5 years from now life will be amazing.  So for now, as long as I can hold on to enough horse time to keep my spirit nourished, and enough snuggles with J, the rest can all take care of itself.  Sigh.  I hate feeling this way, but at the same time I feel like I should stop fighting it, stop trying to make everything fit, and just surrender and go with the flow."

"event","Today I have so far managed to book a Drs appointment and a dentist appointment, and send out a bunch of resumes.  One interview so far.  Yay!  I don't want to leave North Town all together but I do feel that is is time to broaden my horizon, see what else is out there, or at least go through the process of putting together a resume/CV and sending out applications and going on interviews.  So let's see how employable I am...  I waffle back and forth between ""I am an awesome vet, I have worked 3 years in emerg so what clinic wouldn't want me?"" to ""I have been out of school for 3 years, I hate surgery and am afraid of spays, what clinic would want me?"".  It really is quite amusing.

Ok, now it is time to go organise some books.  We got 3 new bookcases last night for the office and discovered we have room for one more, so we will have a total of 8 in the office.  Yay, I am so happy.  I want my hallway and spare room and living room back!

EDIT:  Ok, I feel pretty good about myself.  I sent out 5 resumes last night and I have 2 interviews already!

EDIT #2: Ok, so now within 2 days of sending 5 resumes I have 4 interviews - and clinic #5 (the one that hasn't responded) is not hiring, I just know the Dr in charge so I sent in a resume for next time they are looking.  Whee!"

- Whisper keeps my heart and soul alive
- the gym keeps my body healthy
- snuggling my cats keeps my blood pressure down
- Jason - well, you can't live without love, can you?
- the Grove and other such things keeps me spiritually fulfilled
- North Town (my life as a vet) keeps my mind active, gives me my daily dose of puppy and kitten therapy, gives my life meaning, and is as necessary to me as breathing
- sleep!  I need lots and lots of sleep!
- healthy food, cooking, eating - these things are not optional
- my mother - a necessary annoyance, a great source of stress, but really I am glad she is here
- my house - I need to keep it clean and tidy (or at least somewhat) or else I start twitching in a most unhealthy way - I am seriously thinking of taking a week off just to clean - hey, I have the vacation pay, so why not?
- reading - escapist literature - gives my brain a break from my real life!
- CE - I need to keep learning new things, or else I will stagnate and rot

And on top of all this I now have this wonderful new and exciting project, stimulating and scary all at once, which I just cannot wait to share with everyone!  I'm hoping to be able to spill the beans in about 2 months, but until then you'll just have to put up with the occasional veiled references from me.  

In other news, so far it looks like the election is going well, we have a liberal premier and local liberal representation, which makes me very happy.  However I'm a little surprised by the MMP results."

"event","Life has just been too busy lately.  Here's the recap:

Saturday we got home really late, dropped off mom's cat at the clinic to board, and came home to collapse, exhausted from 3 days of driving.

Sunday we had Grove stuff, which was awesome.

Monday I had a meeting to go to, I helped my mom with some settling-in stuff, and I worked midnight to 8am.

Tuesday I got home in the morning and napped, then did some errands and went to see my horsie in the evening.  My mom is upset because I won't let her go out to see him without me there, but I just don't trust her with him - she will get hurt, he will get hurt, someone will get hurt, and whenever a person gets hurt around a horse, the horse gets blamed, even if the preson was blatantly at fault, so I will not have that.  My horse is awesome, but you need to know how to act around horses or else accidents will happen.

Wednesday I worked.

Today my mom's furniture was supposed to arrive.  We went to customs, no problem.  Then we arrive at the apartment building and they say that the moving truck is too big so the driver has to scramble to find a smaller truck and reload everything so we won't have her furniture until tomorrow.  So no I have a little bit of down time.

Tomorrow, saturday, and sunday, I work.

Maybe on monday we can get back to instgalling the floors in our office...

So that's my life.  My house is a mess but I don't care right now, I am going to relax if it kills me :)"

But, instead, we sat down and watched Grey's Anatomy.  We never watch TV because we don't have cable and our schedules don't allow for regular viewing, so we wait until we get it on DVD.  Hence, we have only seen season 1 so far (no spoilers, please!).  So last night, we watched the last episode in season 1 (for the 2nd time for Jason and 3rd time for me) and then, instead of getting up to paint, we proceeded straight into season 2, which we had just bought recently.  Woo hoo!  I am so excited!  I finally get to watch season 2!  It was a struggle going to bed after just one episode, I really wanted to watch all night!

And today I must drag myself to work, where we will of course be understaffed and overbooked.  Grrr.

On the happy side, my mom's movers are there right now, picking up her stuff.  And I got the keys to her apartment yesterday.  She is really moving.  Although I won't really believe it until we have driven across the border."

Unfortunately it is a bit chilly outside, and the sun keeps coming out and then hiding, but I don't think it's calling for rain at least.  Yay weddings, I am a total geek, I love them.

Tomorrow I am going to watch a clinic at my barn, I'm in no way up to riding in it since I don't like to jump and Whisper is still learning to canter (he will canter... but it's fast and uncoordinated and unpredictable - we're working on it) but I'm really looking forward to watching, learning a bit, and just getting involved in the horsey atmosphere.  I've been pretty much a recluce at the barn, but I feel like I want to get to know people a bit more and be more than just a random person who flits in and out on occasion :)  Plus, I can't think of a more fun way to spend an afternoon than watching pretty horsies.

And that's about it for me.  I have a few days off, which will be consumed with finishing the office, cleaning the house, and getting some stuff set up for my mom's new place.

Sometimes they take turns (""ok, you whack her now, and while she's still reeling I'll pop in and shake her up"") and other times they gang up on my all at once.  You know, any one of these things I could manage with reasonable calmness, but when it's everything all at once...

1) Grove issues.  Enough said.

2) My mom's move.  Stress!  I have to make a million phone calls and errands and get things set, fly to Texas, drive back with her... On my current to-do list we have: phone, internet, cell phone, cable, re-schedule elevator for move-in day, calm her million-and-one panic attacks, deal with her cat who is 16 and antisocial and in no condition to handle this move gracefully, get a triptick from CAA and plot the route for the drive, call my Dr and see if he is taking more patients since she will need a referral to a cardiologist ASAP, call my dentist and see if he is taking more patients, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something...

3) Work.  Not only is the schedule in its usual state of chaos but now, I have to unexpectedly take 3 days off at the end of the month thanks to #2 above.  Now, normally it is the Dr's responsibility to cover their shifts once the schedule is posted, fair enough, but I think this falls under the heading of ""family emergency"" or at least ""family situation"" (did I mention that my mom is in her mid 60's, in poor health, and I am her only living relative? and that she is moving from Texas?) so silly me, I assumed they would be understanding and helpful, considering how very flexible I have been in the past and the fact that I have never before had to leave unexpectedly (I've been there 3 years) and that at least they are getting advance notice on this... But no.  They are giving me grief.

Did I mention that I'm about to explode?

Ok, enough whining and feeling sorry for myself. At least I have:

1) A Grove with whom I can have issues... so many pagans are solitary and have no community at all.
2) A mom who is alive and moving closer to me so I will no longer have to put my life on hold to travel to texas several times each year.
3) A clinic where I usually love working and usually love most of the people.

And we're thinkin gof doing the next renovation project, new floors and paint for the office.

So I'm filling out the application today - keep your fingers crossed!  I'm applying for it myself because that will be simpler than getting her name on the lease, with her currently in Texas and not moving until move-in day.  So I hope it goes smoothly, but since I already have a mortgage I don't know if I'll be a pproved or not... we'll see...

In other news, I am exhausted, fighting a cold, and stressed.  Everything feels up in the air, and being the kind of person I am, I don't like chaos and uncertainty, so I normally respond by cleaning and organising anything I can get my hands on, unfortunately I don't have the energy for that, so I sit on the couch and stew over all the things I should be doing.  

Thankfully I have a great book to read - I am halfway through the final Harry Potter book - and very sad that it will soon be over!  Although I got a copy of Handmaid's Tale at last, and will soon be able to start that, hooray!"

<lj-cut text=""another sleepless ramble""> 
I worked overnight on saturday - and what a night!  Understaffed and absolutely insane.  I won't bore you with details, but it included a cut paw that needed stitches, a kitten who got stepped on, a puppy who was so hypoglycemic I'm amazed he was still alive, a gazillion walkins, and a ful hospital.  Fun fun.  And the previous 3 nights were pretty much the same.  So, needless to say, no breaks or naps for me.  So on sunday morning I come home, exhausted but way too wired to sleep.  I stay up until 10:30 am and go to bed - sleep deeply and well, and wake up at 7pm because Jason is poking me.  It's our only day off together for so so long, so we wanted to actually spend some time together.  Anyways, sunday night I go to bed at 2pm and wake up at 4:30 am, can't sleep, toss and turn, get up to read for a while, go back to bed at 9am and then sleep until 7pm again.  Last night I go to bed at 2am and again woke up at 4:30am.  The problem is, I need to actually be up during the day today!  I need to get groceries, an oil change on my car, check out apartments for my mom, go see my horse (I am about to go into a horse-deprivation-induced seizure), and maybe even go to the gym.  And, of course, I work overnights again on thursday.  What can I say, I am a mess! </lj-cut>

In other news, I bought a furminator for the cats - really awesome!  We are getting so much fur off them, I am excited.  Hopefully soon the number of hairball vomits, and the fur-bunnies hiding in the corners, will go down noticeably.

I am now done HP book 4 and have started 5.  Hoping it will be a better read this time.  And looking forward to 6 and 7!!!

Hmmm, what else...  

Not much, my life is pretty boring these days!"

My silly horse lost a shoe, so I can't ride until the farrier gets out to the barn to fix it.  So today I just brushed him and fed him carrots and took him out for grass.  Very relaxing.

I have been staying on an overnight schedule, so last night/this morning I went to bed as the sun rose, and slept until I was done sleeping - no alarm clock - it was glorious!!  Now I work again wednesday night, I hope we have a kennel staff, I am tired of being under-staffed.  2 people should not have to do the work of 3.

My mother has officially, finally, really-and-truly closed her practice.  I am so happy, this means she will finally be moving back to Canada!  Of course, all the stress of finding her a place to live will fall on me, and then I will have to go down and drive up with her most likely, and apparently her car cannot pull a small U-Haul so I don't know what we will do...  But I'm sure it will sort itself out.

Spiritually I have been in a total slump recently, no time or energy or even interest for much, but I think I may be coming out of that.  It happens periodically, so no big deal.

And I think that's all, folks!  It's 5am, so I will go eat dinner, read a book for a while, and toddle on to bed."

Last night:
- annual exam with a very cute little dog who likes to eat diapers and tampons and other such goodies
- behaviour consult with a dog with huge separation anxiety who ripped some teeth out on her crate
- 15 year old kitty with a bladder infection
- cat with trouble breathing - cool x-rays - removed 300ml of fluid from her chest - breathing much better now
- dog with anal gland issues
- dog having allergic reaction to the shampoo the groomer used after getting a REALLY BAD haircut
- puppy with kennel cough (2 month old, ball of fluff, soooooo cute!)
- ferrett with torn nail bleeding all over the place - that will teach you to try to open the pantry door!
- dog with ginormous abscess - so satisfying to pop and drain!
- dog who ripped his sutures open from a lump removal on his back - I love local anaesthesia, he was in and out and resutured in under 30 minutes
- DOA (dead on arrival) very old boxer

And that's just what came in the door, not what was already in the hopital!  Now, I want to sleep."

Today I start another stretch of overnights.  But instead of sleeping in and then relaxing until it was time to leave for work, I got to wake up early (ok, for most people 3pm is not early, but it is when you wor 8pm-8am!) to drive him to work.  Then I came home. Then I will go to work, he will drive my car home for the night, and come get me in the morning.  But, at least his car is fixable - expensive, but not exorbitant, and not a total write off.  Because I don't think we can afford a new car right now, and with my schedule, being a 1-car family just doesn't work!

I also bought the book for the book club - very excited to start that!  And I booked my emissions test, so once that is done I need to renew my license plate and then that's all done for 1 more year.  And I mailed in my house insurance.  So, productive over all."

Yesterday I got home from work in the morning and went straight to bed.  Woke up around 5 I think.  Went to the barn to visit my horse.  Came home, long phone call with my mom, ordered pizza, and watched TV and read ""Animal Speak"" until 3am.  

Today Jason's car is broken, so I had to wake up to take him to work.  Now I have a few hours of putter time, then I will go riding and pick him up on my way home.  Of course, it's Canada Day, so our street will be closed from 9 to midnight.  And what time is Jason done work?  9, of course!  Grrr.

Tomorrow I will hopefully drag myslf to the gym before ritual.  I haven't been to the gym in almost a week, which really sucks.

My latest fantasy has been about moving.  Away.  Out of Brampton.  To somewhere that the neighbours aren't crammed in like sardines, where I can't hear every workd they say and all the yelling at each other, their kids, their dog... I have come so close to yelling at them to shut up!  I want to move, I really do, but with Jason still not sure about school... and all the stress with my mom... and of course finances... I don't know if it's even worth thinking about... but there's a house about 45 minutes away that costs less than my current house, and is nicer in every way..."

Leave home at 7:30pm, lucky to be home by 9am.  Doesn't leave much time for a life.  I sometimes manage to go to the gym in the morning after an overnight, but not always/often.  And I definitely never make it to the barn on days that I work night shifts.  Just doesn't happen.  Which means I see my horsie once or twice a week, if everything else in under control.  Fortunately a very nice lady at the barn has been riding him, they seem to be connecting well, so a bit of my guilt is relieved, but still... 

Sometimes I just want to work 2 nights each week, or 3 days...  But, then I couldn't afford my horse or my house or any of those other necessities.  I love my job, but I also love my horse and my husband, going to the gym, veging and watching TV and reading...

What I really need is 30 hour days, so I can sleep 12 hours, work 12 hours, and still have 6 hours to myself.  That would work well for me!"

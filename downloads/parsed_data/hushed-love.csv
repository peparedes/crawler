by John Horvath Jr 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along the seashore at the cabin muffled waves through night
Embrace us in our sleep brief unhurried 'til the morning light
Upon these empty sheets reveals the stains of love imagined.
Morning doesn't give a damn for dreams of lovers parted.
Morning wakes and shakes fresh dew off all imaginings.
I can lie here, dream you lay beside me
Morning after morning after we have parted,
Turn to caress and taste your beauty,
Wake wet with tears from missing you, sigh
Like breezes born for nothing but an empty
Space to fill. Beside me you my emptiness must fill.

I will miss you, simple meters, reasoned rhyming,
Closure certain as the morning. Unwise, but I will
Miss you near to sunrise every morning,
At first light and in the darkness
Of my bedroom lonely; lacking kisses,
Shallow breathing become the slightest breezes
Laughing at me when I've risen, falsely risen early
Ready waiting for your eyes to open gently.
I will miss you in the morning.

Morning doesn't give a damn for dreams of lovers parted.
You think that you are going someplace certain--so untrue:
You simply return unto that place where alone you started,
Where daily daylight stains you bleach away, half-hearted
Try recapture simple dreaming. Embrace the dreaming: hold
Off certainty of someplace solid nine-to-five and evenings lonely;
Doze 'til bedclothes cover over eyes that close, then come to me.
I shall take you with me, darling, to the dreamscape where we started--
It's only morning that doesn't give a damn for dreams of lovers parted.
Our dreams are conquests over limits,
together time and space in sleep are bested.

"event","<b>Worthless</b>


i know i always hurt you,
and when you're hurt i cry.
every time i do,
there's feelings inside i hide.

i'm always thinking that i did you wrong,
and one day you'll leave me for someone better.
always wanting love and peace,
but instead i lie in bad weather.

day by day our love grows stronger,
but at times it may die.
it's all because of me,
because of all my stupid lies.

i don't know how you can trust me still,
i've broken so many promises.
always doing stupid things,
showing that i'm compromised.

this is why i always complain,
because i can't keep my mouth shut.
i'm always putting you in pain,
and wanting to kick people's butt.

i'm always doing things wrong,
thats why i shouldn't be trusted.
i'm nothing but a whiny little bitch,
i cry so much that my eyes are rusted.

i'm not exactly sure why,
but i know you disagree with everything i just said.
either you really do love me,
or you just can't get it through your head.

thinking about those times i've put you in pain,
makes me realize that i'm not worth your time.
i'm immature and i play too many games,
i'm worth nothing but a dime.

"event","The sign of the Fish rules the House of the Unconscious, which says a lot about the world that Pisceans live in. A dreamy state is very attractive to these folks, one where some delicious secrets are hidden from their lover, only to be sprung upon them at the right moment. The Fish enjoys alternating between conscious and unconscious states, the better to develop a romance in their vivid minds. When it's back to earth, Pisceans are selfless and intuitive and love to serve their lover. Showering a partner with exquisite fantasies and other sweet things becomes a blissful state for both. The emotions of the Fish run deep and can be rather erotic if their lover knows how to release them. Those born under this Water sign can flow like a river and have a sensitive and spiritual nature which can be quite alluring.

You enjoy kissing anytime and for as long as it takes to get the job done right. You don't mind displaying your affection in any location, and pride yourself in your kissing technique.

You are spicy and can be a little racy. Be careful not to forget the value of a sweet and slow kiss. Your usual hot and heavy kisses are exciting, but it's nice to have a little variety now and then. Overall you are certainly the most sexy of the kissing styles, and you definitely keep the car windows fogged. 

If your score was between 31 and 45: 
<b>You're a Krafty Kisser!</b> 

A Krafty Kisser enjoys being playful and prankish. You're the kind of person that is naturally more frisky and even a little mischievous. You like to pull and run your hands through their hair, creating that combination of pleasure mixed with a tad of pain.

You also like to keep it exhilarating by kissing in places you should not be kissing in. You can get a little freaky and funky, which makes your signature kiss very messy.

Rain O' rain in distress and pain I wait to wash my ills
I pray to God, and He agrees His mercy thus spills

Your spell grooms this earth, Nature bestows you ornaments
Love and warmth awaits you here, with only evil left to lament

You saunter in style, the melody, the rhythm, none compares to it
You wear the anklets of Nature perhaps and dance with tap to add to it

Your realm is bounteous, in every drop you encase the sun
Or close thy eyes on its encounter and glitters escape in fun

Thou mate breeze is blessed, she plays with you she runs you catch
Your scarf of grey and silver flutters this game can have no match

Fragrance envelopes the earth and sky, you meet to kiss the ground
And Bosoms wake to catch a glimpse, of love that Nature bounds

Your charm cripples my mind its flight words get lost, sentences blast
No proof of it in hymns or prose though natal love for you I brought

You go to rest in Heavens above, your comfort's mine I do not mind
But not for long I cannot live and nor the life behind

Rain O' rain far away never again stay
I love you hard we can't apart but death can pave the way

Rain O' rain!! in Nature's lap don't stay for long
I'll strive to prune this world our rendezvous should prolong

"event","<b>THE LOVE OF MONEY</b>

T.E. Cliffe Leslie




This essay was published in November, 1862, in a periodical which has ceased to exist.






The Love of Money has always been in more or less disrepute with moralists. They have almost universally assigned to it nearly the lowest place in the scale of human affections. We say of human affections, for it is one which distinguishes man from all other animals, however intelligent. `You call me dog,' said Shylock to the Christian merchant; `hath a dog money?' Phrenologists have indeed laid down that all the propensitiescombativeness, destructiveness, philoprogenitiveness, alimentiveness, love of life, &c.are `common to man with the lower animals;' but we are surprised that they have not discovered a peculiar protuberance on the outside of the human head corresponding with a peculiar propensity for money inside it. It is the more to be regretted that they have not ascertained the locality of this organ, since a claim has been set up on behalf of the lower animals to a close relationship to the human family. If a bump of philargyriveness or philonomismativeness could be shown on the human head, a conspicuous absence of this manifestation on the cranium of the former would enable us to disprove the connection, to the satisfaction at least of believers in phrenology. It would not, however, enable us, without further inquiry, to determine whether the love of money, which distinguishes us from the brutes, places us above or below them in moral character. To satisfy ourselves on this point, we must begin by inquiring what this thing `Money,' of which men, and men only, are so fond, consists of. Sir Robert reel's celebrated question' What is the meaning of that word, a round, with which we are all familiar? `was answered by himself in terms to the effect that a pound of money is a fixed quantity of gold or silver. But this answer, though highly appropriate to a discussion on the currency, is irrelevant to our present inquiry, whether money is a good or an evil; and whether the love of it is a good or a bad quality in mankind. Sir Robert reel very justly ridiculed the definition given by one writer on the currency of a pound, as `a sense of value in reference to currency as compared with commodities.' Yet in practical life this is really something like what men generally mean and want by money. They mean so much goods; so much of the commodities for sale in the market of the world. A pound to a `navvy,' for instance, is so much beer and tobacco; to his mother it is so much tea and sugar. But these two cases are sufficient to show the extreme difficulty of pronouncing any moral judgment whatever upon the love of money, considered as a general human propensity; for the love of tea and sugar is universally admitted to be in itself an innocent affection, while the love of beer and tobacco is often condemned as combining two most pernicious desires. The love of money is really only a phase for the love of a vast number of different things, which may be good, bad, or indifferent, regarded from a moral, religious, aesthetical, political, or medical point of view, but which are alike in one respectnamely, that they are all to be had for money, and are not to be had without it. As Solomon said, `A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry; but money answereth all things.' The love of money is that universal desire for wealth from which political economists have deduced a theory of commercial values, along with several important truths respecting the conditions of industrial energy and prosperity. Everybody wishes for some kind of wealth, and money is convertible into every other kind; and therefore everybody loves money for some purpose or other, from which we get the laws of competition, prices, wages, profits, and rent. Yet this general principle of pecuniary interest or love of riches by no means explains all the phenomena of the economic world. For it is, as we have said already, only a single expression for a great variety of wants, wishes, and tastes, which are not always the same from age to age, or from country to country, nor felt alike by every individual in any one age or country, and which, moreover, lead to very different consequences as regards the nature, amount, and distribution of wealth, and as regards the material as well as the moral welfare of human society. 

That disease of language which metaphysicians call the realism of the schools still infests many of the terms and phrases which philosophy must employ. A host of different things are alike in some one respect, and a common name is given to them in reference to the single quality or ciromustance which they have in common. It is simply a name for their common feature, but it puts their numerous differences out of sight and out of mind, and they come to be thought of in a lump as one sort of thing. Those moralists, accordingly, who feel themselves the better for heartily denouncing the general principle of the love of money or pursuit of wealth with which political economy sets out, confound, in their horror of a mere abstraction, the love of health, cleanliness, decency, and knowledge, with sensuality, avarice, and vanity. And perhaps political economists have not escaped a bias from their own phraseology, and are apt to imagine in their scientific discussions a much fuller explanation of the complete phenomena of wealth, and a much closer approximation to the complete philosophy of the subject, than lies within their province as commonly circumscribed by themselves at present. 

It is obvious that the love of money includes a demand for various things, the production of which variously affects both the material interests of the consumers and the quality and distribution of the revenue of the whole community. It includes a love of pictures, toys, jewellery, plate, furniture, clothing, opium, soap, bibles, brandy, and, in short, everything in the International Exhibition, and many things not exhibited there. It includes a love of eating and drinking, both in moderation and in excess; of literature and science; of architecture; of the fine arts; of indolence and ease, and of business and sport of foreign travel, and of a country house; of music; of charity, sensuality, cruelty, and power; of horses and dogs. It expresses sometimes a desire for the comforts of an old bachelor, and sometimes an inclination for matrimony; and when it takes the latter direction, it means with one young lady love in a cottage, and with another a palace without love; in one man it is fortunehunting in another, a disinterested attachment to Miss Aurora renniless. The disciples of Malthus know how to discriminate between the economic consequences of these diverse matrimonial tendencies, and the important differences of tihcir influence on the price of beef. Napoleon III. seems to behold in money the sinews of war; his friend Mr. Cobden connects it with commerce and peace. The poor man's love of money is a different feeling from the rich man's, and, accordingly, the writer of this essay never throbs with the emotions which must animate the breasts of Baron Rothschild and Lord Overstone. The American Southerner worships in the almighty dollar the giver of African slaves; the negro slave of Brazil adores it chiefly as the purchaser of liberty. The wealth which is coveted by men in the East is not that which is most prized by the men of the West. An Indian Rajah's chief wealth is a plurality of wives, personal attendants and elephants, and a load of gold trappings on both his elephant's body and his ownall which, not exclusive of the wives, would be more than an English duke or prince could bear. An old writer gives an account of a religious ceremony which he witnessed in Turkey, at which rrince Mustaphaa boy of eleven years old' was so overloaded with jewels, both himself and his horse, that one might say he carried the value of an empire about him.' That is to say, the wealth which, in the hands of English capitalists, would have made a whole territory prosperous, and been distributed in wages through many hundred families, was concentrated upon making one small Turkish child vain and uncomfortable. And the oriental lust for jewels not only has effects upon the economic condition of the world which merit the attention of the political economist, but it has also, in a great measure, sprung from the absence, for many ages, of the conditions essential to general prosperity, and. the accumulation of wealth in really useful forms. Wherever insecurity has long prevailed, a spirit of hoarding must exist, with a desire for that sort of wealth which contains much value in a durable and portable form, and which is easily hidden, easily removed, and none the worse for being buried for months or years in the ground. It is probable, therefore, that the love of gold chains and jewels for which the European Jew is remark able has a European as well as an Asiatic origin, being inherited from his persecuted, plundered, and usurious ancestors in the middle ages, who found it necessary to pack their wealth into the smallest possible compass. 

The existence of security, banks, and paper currency, have long exterminated from England that curious animal the genuine miser, with his treasure in a strong box, doing no good to anyone. Dr. Johnson, talking of misers to Boswell, said, `A man who keeps his money has, in reality, more use of it than he can have by spending it. Why, sir, Lowther, by keeping his money, had the command of the county, which his family has lost by spending it.' But an English millionaire does not keep his money to himself, as the ancient miser, whether he spends it or not. If he saves it, instead of locking it up or carrying it about on his body, he puts it in a bank, and the banker's customers make use of the wealth he does not himself consume. 

But when we say that the form of the love of money which displays itself in a love of dress, ornaments, and jewels, is almost confined to the men of Eastern countries, we must be understood as speaking of men in the narrowest sense, and as making no allusion in that comparison to the ladies of the two hemispheres. Women have everywhere their own peculiar notions of the value of money; and a world of either men alone or of women alone would contain a very different assortment of articles of wealth from that in the great mundane shop for both sexes which exists. With most species of animals, the male is more gorgeously dressed than the female; but so it seems to be with the human species generally, only in its less civilized forms. For we may perceive, with the growth of European civilization, a marked decline in the taste of men for the display of wealth on the body. A mediaeval baron was much more expensively got up than his wife or daughter. Even in the last century the toilette of a gentleman was nearly as elaborate and splendid as that of a lady. Now, a gentleman thinks he makes a smart appearance with a flower in his button-hole, at an assembly at which the ladies are blazing with diamonds. It might be an instructive inquiry how far this difference in the desire for wealth is traceable to a radical difference in the natural mental constitutions of the sexes, and how far to restraints which confine the ambition of women in general to paltry objects, leading them to waste their time in hunting husbands, while men hunt seats in parliament, and foxes. Addison remarks, in the `Spectator,' that `One may observe that women in all ages have taken more pains than men to adorn the outside of their heads.' rerhaps one reason for this is, that men have in all ages prevented them from taking so much pains to adorn the inside. While we are on the subject of dress as one of the equivalents of money, and one of the objects of its pursuit, we may make a remark upon that singular revolution of the human mind through which it has come to be thought, by all men of a certain rank, in the Western world, becoming to attire themselves every evening in black from head to foot, as if for a funeral; and by most men, of all ranks, in that civilized region, becoming to clothe themselves in the dingiest hues all day long. The male apparel which is the last product of civilization appears to display a remarkable mixture of good sense and bad taste. The mistake made by the ladies of our time seems to be that of aiming at show and accomplishing waste; while the mistake of the gentlemen is that of aiming at plainness and accomplishing gloom. 

Many other illustrations might be given of the curious turns taken by the fancy for clothing, as one of the uses of money. In the north of Ireland, for example, it is common to see a girl on the road with a smart bonnet, an extensive petticoat, and a gay parasol carried in the usual manner, but with a pair of shoes not upon her feet, but in her hands. Five-and-twenty years ago such a girl would have no more minded the effect of the sun on the skin of her face, than she now minds the effect of the earth on the skin of her foot; and five-and-twenty years hence it may be safely predicted that such a girl will not only think it advisable to wear her shoes on her feet, but will discover that they really hurt less there, when one is used to them, than the stones upon the road. At the same time, we must admit that the shoemakers of mankindand of womankind, too, we presumehave left nothing undone to perpetuate a prejudice against their own particular production, and to weaken the force of the love of money for the sake of obtaining it. There is, again, in the inventory of modern wealth, and among the civilized uses of money, another article of dress of so obvious and simple a character that many persons may naturally suppose that it descends from the most remote antiquity. Yet, some centuries ago, all the wardrobes in England did not comprise a single night-dress for lady or gentleman, king or queen. Take again, another institution of the modern dressing-roomthe bath. There is a history of civilization in the Tale of a Tub. There is a letter to the old `Spectator,' on the effects of the love of money, in which the writer says that it is to that we owe the politician, the merchant, and the lawyer; `Nay,' he adds, `I believe to that also we are indebted for our `Spectator.'' We are not prepared to explain the various motives which inspire the pens of authors. Did Shakspeare write for money? Did rope? Did Dr. Johnson? Did Lord Macaulay? Does Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton? We are concerned at present with the motives of consumers rather than producers; and one thing at least is clear, that it is highly to the credit of the former to elicit such productions from the latter, and that the love of money in the modern world is to a great extent the love of good, elevating, and instructive objectsa love which meets with its return. New desires for health, decency, knowledge, refinement, and intellectual pleasures, have, in fact, revolutionised production. The antithesis to modern wealth is not so much poverty as a different kind of wealth. The change is more remarkable in the quality than in the quantity. No inconsiderable part of human wealth, it is true, still consists of the means of unhappiness rather than of happiness, and of the gratification of vice rather than of virtue. On the whole, however, there is a transformation in the moral character of wealth, and of the desires involved in the general love of money. For the most part, instead of representing wickedness, brutal delight, and idle pomp, or conquest, tyranny, and plunder, the wealth of Europe represents peace, culture, liberty, and the comfort of the many rather than the magnificence of the few. Where man's treasure is, there his heart is also; and the treasures of modern civilization seem to us to show as remarkable an improvement in the moral as in the intellectual and physical condition of society. `Riches,' said Milton, `grow in hell;' for even in his time much of the wealth that grew on earth bore many marks of being the property of bad and unhappy beings. But we may venture now to ask those well-meaning persons who, without regard to time and place, and without discrimination between good and evil, repeat ancient warnings against the love of money and the pursuit of wealth, whether they mean to praise dirt under the name of poverty, and whether they think idleness better than industry, ignorance better than science and art, and barbarism better than civilized progress? To political economists, on the other hand, we venture to suggest the cultivation of a department of the philosophy of riches which has never been scientifically investigated. The laws which regulate the value of the supply forthcoming from producers have been almost exhaustively developed in political economy; but the deeper laws which regulate the demand of the consumers, and which give the love of money all its force and all its meaning, have never yet received the regular attention of any school of philosophers."

"event","<b>Loving Your Children

Getting the Message Across</b>


<i>""The supreme happiness in life is the conviction that we are loved."" - Victor Hugo </i>


Of course you care about your children. As do most parents, you probably make many sacrifices to feed, clothe, and educate your children. You might brag about them to anyone who will listen. Perhaps you even carry their pictures around to show off to your friends. 

Yes, with rare exceptions, all parents love their children; yet, not all children feel loved. Even when their parents love them, some children think no matter what they do, they are not wanted. Others learn their parents care about them only when they behave in certain ways. Not all children are lucky enough to know that whatever they say or do, their parents care. 

Clearly, being loved is not the same as feeling loved. It is not enough to know you love your children. You have to be sure they know it, too. You have to show them you love them just the way they are, just because they are. Loving your children, then, is largely a matter of getting the message across. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------


<b>Hidden Messages</b>

With children, it is often the little things that count the most. You may have scrimped and saved to buy a bigger and better home. But young children do not know that such acts express your love for them. Instead, simple, everyday events tell young children whether or not you value them. Your presence, a smile, a gentle touch, and a kind word spell ""I love you"" to a child. 
In the same way, day-to-day happenings can tell children they are not valued very highly. Unintentionally your words and actions can convey to children that you do not care. Think about how some of the things you say and do might look from a child's point of view: 

Do you. . .
. . .tend to feed, clothe, and bathe your baby hurriedly, never taking advantage of this time to touch, talk, and play?
. . .only show your affection for your children when they do something that pleases you? 
If you are always in a hurry, your child might be learning not that you are busy, but that he or she is not important. If you express your love only under certain conditions, your child may be learning that you love him - IF he obeys or IF he does not wet the bed or IF he does not make any mistakes. And if children receive many such messages, they might begin to think you are not glad to have them. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------


<b>Successful Signals</b>

Children who feel unloved act differently from those who feel loved. They spend lots of time trying to reassure themselves and other people of their worth. They are very cautious about trying new things, for failure hurts them deeply. 
Children who know they are loved, on the other hand, do not have to waste time proving their worth. They are not afraid to try out their wings. They know even if they fail, they can still count on your love and respect. 

Be sure your children feel secure about your love for them: 


Look at what your words and actions could be telling your children about themselves. 
Find ways to show your children that no matter what, you love them. 


This does not mean if you ever get angry or frustrated with your children, they are ruined forever. Children do not need perfect parents. Ordinary people will do. If the overall climate you create is one of love and respect, your children will learn they are valued -- 
just the way they are,
just because they are,
no ifs, ands, or buts. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------


<b>Love Letters</b>

Few things will be more important in deciding your children's futures than their senses of self-worth. How they feel about themselves will affect whom they choose as friends, how they get along with others, and how well they make use of their abilities -- in other words, all aspects of their lives. The strategies described can strengthen your children's feelings of self-worth by letting them know you love and value them. 

Pay Attention To Your Children
Take time to talk to them, listen to them, and show interest in their activities and interests. Try to find times when you are not hurried or tense and can focus just on them. 

Express Your Affections Often Through Physical Contact
With babies, this means holding and cuddling. As children get older, you can offer hugs, kisses, caresses, an arm over the shoulder, or a pat on the back. Sometimes the right words are hard to find, but a gentle hug says it all. 

Treat Your Children With the Same Respect You Show Adults
Too often parents reserve one set of manners for adults and another for children. Parents may embarrass their children by scolding or criticizing them in front of others. Or they might get so involved in a conversation they forget their presence. Children are no less sensitive than adults and deserve the same kind of respect. 

Tell Your Children They Are Appreciated
Do not wait until they get good grades. Do not limit your praises to their good looks or manners. Let them know you enjoy them and think they are great all the time. 

Respond To Your Children With Patience And Understanding
When your child spills his milk for the third time in a row or hits his sister over the head with a toy shovel, it is easy to treat him as a criminal. Try, though, to see the child as someone who needs your help in controlling his body and emotions. 

Respect Children's Feelings And Abilities
Because of their sizes, we sometimes forget that children are people, too. They have a right to privacy and to feelings of their own. Parents might have to remind themselves not to carry children when they can get there on their own or to speak for them when they can do this for themselves.

NAIROBI (AFP) - A baby hippopotamus that survived the tsunami waves on the Kenyan coast has formed a strong bond with a giant male century-old tortoise, in an animal facility in the port city of Mombassa , officials said.

The hippopotamus, nicknamed ! Owen and weighing about 300 kilograms (650 pounds), was swept down Sabaki River into the Indian Ocean , then forced back to shore when tsunami waves struck the Kenyan coast on December 26, before wildlife rangers rescued him.

""It is incredible. A-less-than-a-year-old hippo has adopted a male tortoise, about a century old, and the tortoise seems to be very happy with being a 'mother',"" ecologist Paula Kahumbu, who is in charge of Lafarge Park , told AFP.

""After it was swept and lost its mother, the hippo was traumatized. It had to look for something to be a surrogate mother. Fortunately, it landed on the tortoise and established a strong bond. They swim, eat and sleep together,"" the ecologist added.

""The hippo follows the tortoise exactly the way it follows its mother. If somebody approaches the tortoise, the hippo becomes aggressive, as if protecting its biological mother,"" Kahumbu added.

""The hippo is a young baby, he was left at a very tender! age and by nature, hippos are social animals that like to stay with t heir mothers for four years,"" he explained."

Kids, aged 5 to 10, were asked questions about what they thought of love and marriage. Here's what they said.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
Love and Marriage:

""If falling in love is anything like learning how to spell, I don't want to do it. It takes too long."" -- Glenn, age 7 

""Love is like an avalanche where you have to run for your life."" -- John, age 9 

""I think you're supposed to get shot with an arrow or something, but the rest of it isn't supposed to be so painful."" -- Manuel, age 8 

""No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to do with how you smell. That's why perfume and deodorant are so popular."" -- Mae, age 9 

""Love is the most important thing in the world, but baseball is pretty good too."" -- Greg, age 8 

""Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find me a wife."" -- Tom, age 5

"event","<i>Just something to think about


  If you found love, would you recognize it?  Would you be able to tell the difference between love and infatuation?   Between love and attraction?  Between love and sexual desire? Between love and friendship?  Between sex and intimacy?  Between a good relationship and one that is only pleasurable?  Its so easy to think about love, to talk about love, to wish for love, but it's not always easy to recognize love, even though all the signs are right in front of your eyes.  How could one be able to tell the difference, when the line that separates love and infatuation is so thin?  Is there a way to tell the difference?  Honestly, I don't think so, but in order to ever find out you have to be willing to take that chance.  Have faith that your heart will lead you in the right direction, but the thing is, fate will only get you so far.   Once you're there its up to you to make it happen.  Sometimes you just have to go with your heart and you never lose by loving but you'll always miss out if you hold back.  The essential sadness is to go through life without loving, but its equally sad to go through life with out telling the ones who mean the most to you that you care about them.  Don't let love slip away so easily, give it another chance.  Never let a broken heart take the chance for love away and never let the pain over come your need for love.  Forget about the heartbreak of the past and remember only what it has taught you.  Some people come into our lives and quickly go away and others stay awhile but they both leave footprints on our heart and either way we are never the same. The best and most beautiful things of the world cannot be seen or touched, they must be felt with the heart.  It is a wonderful feeling to be loved but there is no emotion greater than giving love.  Love has no other desire than to fulfill itself, to bring you and those who surround you happiness. 
  So now I ask myself, why does one push love away?  If love is such a great emotion and such a wonderful feeling, why do I find myself holding back?  The memories of my past have taken my faith and have shattered my dreams of giving myself completely to love.  It's the memories of a hurtful past that causes an individual to love with their mind and not their heart.  The memory of being in love, giving your all and receiving nothing more than a broken heart.  Pain that is so great and runs so deep you loose yourself in thoughts of anger.  You give up and hide your emotions in the empty space where love once was.  It hurts so bad and you say to yourself, never again, never again will I give my love, I trust no one.  Then as the days turn to weeks, the weeks into months, and the months eventually to years, the pain, still there, but not as intense.  And before you know it you meet someone. You start off as friends and then you notice that he makes you laugh and smile in a way you thought you would never be able to do again.  Eventually those friendly feelings grow into something a little more than friendly.  Your attracted to him but you keep it to yourself.  And then one day, out of nowhere, one passionate kiss.  Then you notice that the hurt and anger gets replaced with hugs and kisses.  Intense feelings running through your body and then you realize that you've let your guard down.  How can this be possible?  You think, this can't be happening to me.  I've fallen in love again.  Now you have to make a choice.  One that could change your life for the better or one that could make your situation complicated and confusing.  Do I love him for him or do I put limitations on how far this could go because of a love that was lost?  That's when you have to ask yourself ""Am I the one who has missed out?  Am I the one who gave up?"" and if you can answer truthfully with a ""No.""  Then you have lost nothing.   If you gave your love faithfully and honestly, then you have done nothing wrong.  And you have to realize that you are the better person and there is someone out there that will appreciate what you have to offer.  Someone who will do for you as you would do for them.  Just remember what comes around goes around and when it's your turn you will receive all that you deserve.  When you are in love and you end up getting hurt, it's like a cut.  It will hurt for a while and then eventually heal but there will always be a scar.  
  Life's glory is not in never falling, but getting up every time you fall.  Trust in what your heart tells you, believe in what you know inside.  Remain true to yourself and don't look back but look forward to all the endless possibilities.  Love takes time and you don't have to go looking for love, love will find you and when it does just dance like no ones watching and love like its not going to hurt.  Try not to judge someone before you get the chance to truly know that person because if you do you take away an opportunity that could fill in some of the empty spaces in your life with happiness and maybe eventually love.  Love is stream that will find it's own course.  All you have to do is follow your heart and it will lead you to your path of happiness and will give you the strength and guidance to find a true love that will stay.

by Ara John Movsesian </b>


<i>There is a light that shows me the way, 
To a secret garden, with a fragrant bouquet, 
And as I enter through its welcoming gates, 
To savor all that for me awaits - 
I can't help but wonder why the light chose me 
Why fate gave me the Garden's key. 

For whatever the reason, this much I know, 
It is a lovely place where I love to go - 
A garden full of life's delights - 
Of tenderness and wondrous nights. 

A garden in which to nourish my soul; 
A place to go to make me whole 
Where the warming light becons me ""stay;""
Where always it is Valentine's Day. 

Time has shown me this simple truth, 
That the light that shines from high above - 
That leads me to this garden each day 
Is the nurturing light of your infinite love. </i>"

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways,
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed, to lose
With my lost saints-I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!-and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.

"event","True Love is the highest object of many people's lives. It is a common theme in romantic novels and movies. True Love can be in most romantic lives, a part of a lifestyle, in their everyday lives. It is used to express passion or love between one person and another.

It is often said that to find True Love one would cross a burning desert or sail the seven seas - this is to emphasise the amount of hardship one would endure to find this higher emotional reality, aptly titled True Love. It is perhaps strange that we view the truthfulness of this love in direct conjunction with how many burning deserts it inflicts upon the lover. (The 'lover' is a term first coined in Elizabethan English and it means the person who gives love. The 'lovee' is the receiver of this love, true or otherwise.)

Not everyone agrees on the definition of True Love:

--Some people say that finding True Love is mainly a matter of finding a compatible partner. Others emphasize qualities within oneself.

--Some modern philosophers believe that True Love could actually be considered tantamount to the voice of God, and that the religious yearning could be seen in the romantic context as a metaphor for love that is true.

--Some people believe that True Love is best defined as genuine love, whether that love be manifested by sacrifice, sharing, caring, etc; the inner means that motivate those actions are rooted in complete authenticity.

--Some people believe that True Love is the complete acceptance of a person without any condition. According to this definition True Love cannot be scaled: you cannot truly love a person little or more, you can truly love or not because you cannot 'partially' completely accept a person. It has also been said that True Love is an expression and total compassion and not a power - and that therefore True Love cannot be the most powerful thing because it cannot be defined by comparison or powerfulness.

--Some people say that True Love should be called simply love. Others, however, feel that the world does not always define love as True Love, and so seek to separate the definition of True Love from other definitions of love.

--Some people consider it to mean finding satisfaction in the arms of a lover - with little or no regard for your partner's well-being or happiness. Some people believe that True Love can only be judged as true in relation to how it changes the lover. True Love has been said to destroy the person who experiences it, and introduce the idea of salvation to them.

--Some people opine that True love is probably only set apart from just ""love"" by the feeling of wanting your loved one to be truly happy, even if it means sacrificing certain personal dreams, because if you truly love someone, you would just want them to be happy.

"event","Love has several different meanings in the English language, from something that gives a little pleasure (""I loved that meal"") to something one would die for (patriotism, pairbonding). It can describe an intense feeling of affection, an emotion or an emotional state. In ordinary use, it usually refers to interpersonal love. Probably due to its emotional primacy, love is one of the most common themes in art.

Love might best be defined as acting intentionally, in sympathetic response to others (including God), to promote overall well-being. Or to put simply, love responds intentionally to promote well-being (Thomas Jay Oord).

Love is inherent in all human cultures and thus may be seen as a defining trait of humanity, that is, love is a quality that makes one human. It is precisely these cultural differences that make any universal definition of love difficult, but not impossible, to establish. See the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Expressions of love may include the love for a soul or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, etcetera. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain.

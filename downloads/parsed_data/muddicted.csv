<lj-cut text=""desc"">There is a fair, slim, fresh-faced siriyu here.

A willowy siriyu youth of sylph-like build and delicate mien, with a sweet, open face as fresh and pretty as a flower. Large and luminous eyes of a bright cornflower blue dominate his otherwise soft and fine features. Gossamer locks of fine, pale hair float like thistledown about his cheeks, having been hacked off carelessly short enough to bare the white nape of his neck. All about his unblemished countenance and slender limbs there hangs an air of exquisite and painful delicacy, as of white liles, or newly fallen snow.

Mersault has fair skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes.

Over my travels I have gathered a few rare items, and am far from a merchant
so I have decided to auction them off. This will be a silent auction all bids
must me delivered to me. In two weeks the items will be sold to the highest
bidder.
 The first two items will be as follows :

------------------------------------
Kin abroad, I come to you all once more with arms open wide. Many of our
people have gone astray, but this is a matter we can set right.

You from Bladen, the displaced. You search for a home, yet you have trouble
finding a place that will accept you.

You from Hes'Xirtl, children of despondence. You have been downtrodden,
without a meal for so long.

You from Seria, you who believes you belong to Cranezmore, it is your home
that calls to you. Gheldale is waiting for her children to return to grow
within her groves, to illuminate her as you are meant to. Elysiriyu,
hylsiriyu, gorusiriyu. It is this we call to you:

Come home.

Is your path pockmarked with ill repute? If you seek change, the Ge'siri can
offer such redemption for you. If you are only just seeking a warm bed and
company of those who share your blood, Gheldale is home.

Threyne Silenus, Gallant Tal'siri of the Ge'siri, Vanguard of Justice

Shifted servers and am now playing at Zenith, where I've started Naoe as my third baby sws. He's not as cute as the other two were but has the best luck of the lot; by this logic he may actually get to 40 after a while, since I'm not as terribly fond of him. But seriously, this is the last Elven Knight I ever make =_= (I'm mostly waiting for someone to run up and go HAHAHA LOOKING FOR KAGETORA? at him; I hope they do!).

Idaho (34, 6x server) as I last left him. I'll always love him the most, he was my first char ever and he had the sweetest little face. I just couldn't really fit in, I guess? and the last couple of weeks it felt more like Poland than Paradise.

<img src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c156/ganymar/lei/lei_nostalgia.jpg"">
Lei (28, 8x server) in his early teens I think, before he got into a clan and had a sugar daddy drop ssd and top D meatgrinders on him. He has my haircut :D only he's blonde, and well, it has a different effect on a guy. RIP Estralita; it's a shame, I really liked the few people I ran into there. Maybe the population was too small to have many idiots in, but even the random strangers I met there spoke to you as though you were actually another human being.

<img src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c156/ganymar/naoe/18_roa.jpg"">
Naoe (19, 5x server) is the most disgustingly spoiled; same sugar daddy, different server. He got to run around RoA at level 15 with full prophet and sws buffs wthhh. I regret not choosing the haircut with bangs for him too, but it would just remind me of Lei ;_; and the real Naoe N. has been traumatized enough already. Though whyyyy does all heavy armour look 100x hotter on DEMs than on LEMs. I remember drooling over Azrael in piece bone, but on Naoe it's BALLOON PANTS WHAT THE HELL.

Totally motivated to level now I've finally seen a 5x sws in action. (Okay, my actual reaction was something like AAAAAAAAAAOMFGGGGGG MY HERO.)"

Temerius says to a slim siriyu male with long, midnight-black hair in common 'Yes.'

Someone nods slightly at the others, placing his hand again, smiling down comfortly to Laux before moving towards the boat.

Silrayn WAHS.

Temerius stops using a small ring of silver engraved with vines.
Temerius stops using a whip of mystical origin.
Temerius puts a large barrel of icewine in a sturdy travellers pack.

Silrayn sniffs sadly.

A slim siriyu male with long, midnight-black hair nods slowly towards Audris.

Laux follows King Allan and stands near the entrance of the ship.

Renard grumbles faintly to himself and eyeing Temerius and Laux with an unreadable expression on his face.

King Allan stands by Laux turning to face them before bending to whisper towards Laux ear.

Laux tilts his head in question at King Allan.

Silrayn closes a large, nulliak skin backpack.

Laux nods at King Allan.

Laux leaves north.
Temerius leaves north.

You yell in common, in a level monotone, 'I curse your ship to be sunk a swimmable distance from the shore!'

You shake your head negatively at her.

From the north, Laux yells in common, distantly, 'Love you, too, Renard. DON'T BURN YOUR HAIR!'

You say in common, in a level monotone, 'What for? They can jolly well pick it up themselves when they get back.'
You grumble distractedly to yourself.

Beyond the eastern lands, a loud explosion can be heard, ringing out even towards Seria.  If one turns to the east, beyond the horizon fireflies can be seen wafting up into the sky, as if dancing towards the heavens.

(skip a bit)

As if in mourning, as the fireflies reaches the heavens, around M'dhoria the wolves begin to howl, a lamenting song as if of loss before there is silence.

"event","I had the above song (albeit remixed by m-flo) playing halfway through, and it seemed oddly appropriate. woefully I didn't log the earlier conversations Shu had with Agravis that led up to this - the first, asking Agravis where Asa was, and getting quite drunk - and the next, getting told by Agravis to stay away from Asa. 

<lj-cut text=""the best part is the gtell about Barley, though!"">

Shulei is here, thin frame trembling slightly as though in a strong wind.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Agravis...'

Asa says to you in common, nodding slightly, 'Ah.'

Shulei looks at his feet, scuffing the toe of one boot against the wooden planks.
Shulei bobs his head up and tries to beam reassuringly at Asa.

You beckon for everyone to follow.

Asa now follows you.

Thunder clashes and roars across the fields.

look
Along the Eastern Road
Here the road curves a bit, gently descends down the hillside toward a small harbor and village below.  The squaking sound of seagulls flying over the shoreline echoes through the salty, moist air.  Fields of long grass and wildflowers border the road, swaying in the light breezes that waft through. The path also leads northwards, along the edge of a cliff that rises above the coastline.  
[Exits: north east]
(Charmed) Looking ready to strike, a shadow wolf stands silently just behind its master.
A large, tundra wolf stands silently by its master awaiting its orders.
Asa, He Who Gives is here.
A flock of noisy seagulls dive overhead.

[walking to beach]

Beach
The water swells and laps over the shoreline, carrying tiny particles of sand and bits of plantlife.  The sand is fine and soft, broken down by many years of pounding surf.  Seabirds dip and soar, some almost riding the waves while looking for their next meal.  Small shore birds run along the swash zone, grabbing at small sea life with their sharp beaks.  A ship can be seen out near the horizon, probably bound for the harbor to the south.  
[Exits: west]
     A spiral of mist is floating above the sandy ocean
A shadow wolf has arrived from the west.
Asa has arrived from the west.
A tundra wolf has arrived from the west.

You beam delightedly at nothing in particular.

You are now seen as: 
Shulei is here, hugging himself, standing uncertainly as though in a strong wind.

Asa nods to you.

Shulei kicks at the edge of the foam, looking at it curling over his feet.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Nothing. Um. I met him in the square once'
You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'And he told me I wasn't going to be any good to you and I oughtn't to see you any more.'

Shulei breaks off to chew on a stray lock of hair for a while.

Towards the west the sky brightens up before you can see what seems to be a hail of fire raining down from the sky.

You blink innocently.

Shulei starts, looking inland to the west.

Asa frowns and shields his eyes as he turns towards the west.

Shulei wahs.

You say in common, blondely, '... Fireworks?'
You peer intently west.

Asa says to you in common 'Not sure.  Do you suppose it's safe here?'

Shulei shakes his head, looking back at Asa and fretting his lower lip.
Shulei laughs a little.

Seiran sends you an OOC message saying '...^^;;;'</i>

The rolls of thunder rolling across the fields fades into silence.

Asa nods.

Shulei squints a little at Asa, his hands fidgeting.

Asa says to you in common 'So what did you say back to him?'

You say to Asa in common, blondely, '... Nothing much. He didn't look like he wanted to listen.'
You sit down and rest.

Shulei sifts idly through the sand, peeking up at Asa's face quickly from time to time.

Asa wipes at his nose with his sleeve.
Asa says to you in common 'What do you think?'

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'What do you think?'
You laugh joyously.

Asa smiles faintly.

Shulei looks across the sand at Asa, sighing.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Am I any good to you?'

Asa looks away from you considering this, posture stiffening.

The fields are no longer being bathed in rainfall.

Shulei tilts his head at Asa easily, but the lines of his mouth and eyes are strained and waiting.

A shadow wolf lifts its head, watching silently.

Asa turns back to look at you and shrugs small.
Asa says to you in common 'How did we get into this in the first place?'

Shulei leans his elbows on his knees, sinking his chin to rest on his crossed forearms.
Shulei peers up at Asa.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'I guess it happens very slowly...'

The clear sky opens up over the fields.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'It's reversible, though? I think. If maybe..'

Asa tilts his head slightly to the side.
Asa says to you in common, frowning slightly, '...reversible?'

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Like before all this started.'

Shulei scratches at his ears, trying to make them stop twitching.

A faint voice can barely be heard ""Dead...dead...roll off with your head...'

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'I want it all to be like before. But things are all different. Laux and Tem are gone, and even Caliah isn't around much... and you're not around at all.'
You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'And I'm not, either. I haven't forgotten that.'

Asa raises his arm to wipe his cheek but stops and lets it hang at his side.
Asa says to you in common '...I guess anything is possible... In this world.'

You stand up.
You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Am I any good to you? Really?'
You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'I don't know if Agravis is right. But I think, whatever you think about it, I'll go with that.'

Shulei smiles at Asa.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Even if it's the same as what Agravis says.'

Asa says to you in common 'I'm not so sure right now... but you were at one point.'
Asa frowns at his words.

Shulei flinches slightly, continuing to look at Asa.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Should I ... do what he says, then?'

Shulei clasps his hands behind his back to stop them from fidgeting.

Asa gives you an embarassed smile.
Asa says to you in common 'I was always thinking that I'd always go along with what you wanted.'

Shulei smiles a little.

Asa says to you in common 'I can't tell you what to do... really.'

The fields darken as clouds roll in, obscuring the sky.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'I've always just wanted to do.. whatever you want me to do.'

Shulei scuffs his foot in the sand, looking down.

Asa laughs softly.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'In all seriousness.'

Shulei flushes, and turns his head away, looking out to sea.

Asa looks at you.
Asa says to you in common '....'
Asa says to you in common 'Are you having doubts?'

You blink innocently.
You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Doubts about what?'

Asa says to you in common 'us?'

Shulei blinks, raising his head to look at Asa.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Are you?'

Shulei drops his head almost immediately, eyes half-shut as though ready to wince.

Seiran roams out of the shadows.

Asa says to you in common 'I wouldn't say doubts.'
Asa blinks innocently.

Shulei blinks, starting violently.

Seiran leaves west.

Asa peers intently west.

Shulei turns back to look at Asa, blinking slowly.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'Then...'
You tilt your head in question at him.

Asa says to you in common 'I'm not sure what a relationship is worth.'

Shulei stares at Asa, his expression still uncomprehending.

Asa says to you in common '...you know at one point, I was wiling to give up a lot of things for you.'

From the corner of your eye, you see the movement of something, or someone, briefly moving through the shadows.

The fields darken as clouds roll in, obscuring the sky.

Asa says to you in common 'and it's not like how it used to be, but my thoughts haven't changed.'

Shulei nods faintly, numbly, and unclasps his hands to fold them across his chest, hugging himself quietly.

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'I wouldn't want you to give up anything for me.'
You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'You don't have to do anything, really...'

Shulei worries his lower lip with his teeth for a moment before opening his mouth to speak again.

A burning sensation seems to creep into your head briefly, then leaves as quickly as it came.

Asa says to you in common 'I think. some relationships take more work than others.'

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'And this one...?'

Shulei plays with the edge of his cloak, looking at the cloth hanging off his arm.

Asa says to you in common '...I don't know.'

You sigh.

Asa says to you in common 'the point is, there would be people opposed to us.  In different ways.'

You blink innocently.
You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'I don't really care about that. But Agravis is different because, well. You know.'

Asa says to you in common '...how?'

You say to Asa in common, blondely, 'I thought, maybe, you'd care about what he thinks...'

Shulei kisses Asa awkwardly on the cheek, ducking his face away in almost the next instant.
Shulei turns his face up to the sky, blinking away the rain in his eyes.

Thunder clashes and roars across the fields.

Shulei whistles to a shadow wolf, looking at Asa uncertainly.

Asa says to you in common 'yeah.'

Shulei bites his lip, fiddling with the hilt of his sword.

Therak smiles at you.

look
Inside A Rainforest
The canopy of trees and life seems to thin here, permitting a small
amount of light in through the multi-layered greenery.  The deep, putrid
mud, of the rainforest, apparently causes suction to any weight being
pressed down upon it.  The deep, heady smell of the rainforest is replaced
by the stink of swamp-gas, a methane-like rotting scent that hangs heavy in
the uncharacteristically quiet air.  A trail of moist, dark brown soil
becomes wider here, leading off to the east.  To the north and west, the
dense forest expands far beyond what can be seen normally.  

[Exits: north east south west]
A felis scout moves slightly in the shadows.
Therak, Imperturbable Hand of the Empire is here.

<i>You send an OOC message to Therak saying '...'</i>

Sveva flicks her ears slightly, edging a sideways glance at a felis scout, then moving back to look at Therak.

Sveva stretches slightly, appearing to step carelessly a little behind a felis scout.

Therak says to you in common, in a calm, quiet tone, 'No, but I do like to collect... and you as a citizen of our city would have certain special rites my other pets do not.'

Sveva leans an elbow on a felis scout's shoulder, tilting her head to look thoughtfully at Therak.

A felis scout blinks, looking up at you; then looks at Therak, and his eyes widen slightly before he glares at you.

A felis scout leaves south.

Therak says in common, in a calm, quiet tone, 'Personally I find Canidae to be more docile when it comes to taming.'

Sveva takes her elbow off a felis scout and rests a hand on her hip, eyeing Therak with a detachedly cat-like air of subtle appraisal.

Therak says to you in common, in a calm, quiet tone, 'Once fault of the felis as pets, that I have found.'

You snicker softly.

A felis scout leaves south.

You say to Therak in common, in a soft, throaty growl, 'It depends if you wish your pets to be a challenge, or not..?'

Therak communes with his Deity.
A spring of holy water flows from the ground.

Therak drinks water from a spring of holy water.
Therak utters the words, 'qcamdieha yaae'.
A Magic Mushroom suddenly appears.

Trail into the Valley
Large, fern-like weeds grow between the crumbling debris along this path.
A small tongue of rock winds down the cliff's side causing unsure footing to
the valley below.  The path itself is thin, with foot and handholds chipped
out of the rock in a crude manner.  A small amount of tree cover offers
little protection letting the wind, that rises from the ocean, free reign
along the cliffs.  To the west, a forest of tall trees creates an
umbrella-like canopy, casting a dark shadow over its underbrush.  To the
south, the Blood Cliffs loom over the ocean.  The stench of swampy muck
mingles with the scents of sea air and the fresh breeze from the valley
below.

Ren gates to Ty and brings in his windigo when he finds Ty and Zarh.. well, watching some gamekeeper dude whack the two-headed dragon. Ren gets whacked by the dragon - autoassist is ALWAYS off, so no idea how this happened - and dragon deals something like -750hp, plus poison, before he manages to flee.

the rest of this log is sort of a duel between siri fast healing and poison hp drop, as well as things you can't do when you're almost dead.

A Narrow Alley
Although well lighted, this narrow alley seems desolate and abandoned. 
The tunnel is wide enough for perhaps two groths, but it would be
uncomfortably close.  Few duergar travel through this alley, signifying that
it is doubtful there is anything of importance this way.  Up near the top of
the tunnel is a large, round mirror.  It appears to be reflecting the light
from the lantern at the end of the tunnel, lighting up the alley fairly
well.  To the east the walls turn in, leading to an attaching room.  An old
sign hangs crooked above the entrance way, with the faded letters ""Jewels""
upon it.

Agravis drinks local specialty from a Salty Sunset.

Shulei raises his glass in three directions, one of which is towards Agravis.

Agravis chuckles at your joke.

<i>* agr You've been in Haphen lately, then?</i>
You say to Agravis in common, blondely, 'You've bkeen iRn HapphReen ldatttely, thyenI?'

Agravis says to you in common, in a low, gruff tone, 'Business... I suppose. I've been learning a few curses'
Agravis nods.

You feel the light tapping of someone pressing their finger against your right shoulder.

Shulei squints at Agravis, nodding very slowly.

Agravis says to you in common, in a low, gruff tone, 'Haphen is the best place to learn curses. Which, I think, is more useful than healing spells in a war.'
Agravis leans his elbows on the bar, his gaze boring into you.

Shulei stares into his glass for a while, nodding at Agravis pleasantly, if rather mechanically.

Agravis says to you in common, in a low, gruff tone, 'What did you want to talk to me about, young one?'

Shulei blinks and raises his head to look at Agravis.

<i>* agr Um did you meet a lot of people on Haphen?</i>

You say to Agravis in common, blondely, 'Ojh...'

Agravis says to you in common, in a low, gruff tone, 'Was there anyone you wish I'd met?'
Agravis steadily looks at you.

Shulei flicks his ears faintly, looking at his hands on the bartop.

<i>* agra I haven't seen Asa in a while. I was wondering where he's gone.</i>
You say to Agravis in common, blondely, 'I haven'tt seeen AAsa innnn a whilee. I wasss wPoondereinng where he'sss gonne.'

Agravis blinks innocently.

Shulei folds his feet underneath the stool and turns his face to look out of the doorway.

Agravis looks at the glass on the countertop.
Agravis says to you in common, quietly, 'I thought he'd stayed here.'

Shulei makes a few clacking noises at the fat seagull outside the door, in a friendly if somewhat inebriated manner.
Shulei shakes his head without turning to look at Agravis.

Agravis looks out the door to the east without seeing anything.

You say in common, blondely, 'Maybe he has. I stopped asking people around here.'
You drink local specialty from a Salty Sunset.

Agravis stays your hand before he can drink any more.

In your inebriated state, you doze off.
You go to sleep at a large bar surrounded by several stools.
You feel less tired.

The Rusty Pelican
The faint scent of alcohol lingers in the musty air of this wooden building, mingled with the salt air that creeps in through the many cracks
in the walls.  All along the wooden walls of the establishment are various mounted fish, nets, and other various pieces of salvage that have come from
the nearby coastal area.  The floor of this small building are filthy, covered in sand and mud.  Patrons sit at tables and along the bar, talking
amongst themselves and laughing loudly from time to time.  
[Exits: east (down)]
     A strange, patchwork book lies here.
     A large bar surrounded by several stools dominates the dingy room.
Agravis is resting at a large bar surrounded by several stools, head in one hand, an elbow resting on the counter top, toeing the book cautiously.
(White Aura) A grungy man with bright red hair grins at his patrons.

Agravis takes the glass from your hand gently.

You give a Salty Sunset to Agravis.

You hiccup.

Agravis shakes his head.
Agravis stands up.
Agravis utters the words, 'qcamdieha gsfuio'.
A magical spring flows from the ground.

Agravis sits down at a large bar surrounded by several stools and rests.
Agravis says to you in common, in a low, gruff tone, 'Don't drink too much. You'll hurt in the morning.'

You say to Agravis in common, blondely, 'Want Assaa.'

Agravis reaches over to you and gently wipes a corner of his lips.
Agravis says to you in common, softly, 'I know.'

Shulei's head droops and he slumps forward onto the bartop again, his eyes sliding shut.

Agravis pulls back and rests his elbow on the counter top, his eyes never leaving you.
Agravis says to you in common, in a low, gruff tone, '...Why do you think he left?'

Shulei stirs a little, rolling his head to lie on one arm, blinking at Agravis hazily.

In your inebriated state, you doze off.
You go to sleep.

Shulei climbs back up on the stool.
You sit down at a large bar surrounded by several stools and rest.

Agravis nods, impressed at how quickly you was able to recover.
Agravis beckons for you to follow him.

Shulei immediately sprawls over the bar again.

Agravis smooths your hair out gently.
Agravis says to you in common, in a low, gruff tone, 'But I think you want this pain in his absence.'

Shulei looks at Agravis for a minute before he sinks his head back into his folded arms.
Agravis sits back in his chair, sighing.
Agravis shakes his head and gets a hardened look in his eyes.

Shulei's shoulders begin to tremble slightly, digging his fingers into his sleeves.

Agravis says to you in common, with unwavering gentleness, '...What happened. Why did he leave.'

Shulei peeks again at Agravis.

You say to Agravis in common, blondely, 'I didn't really want to bother you. Just to know if you've seen him.'

A Road along the Coast
This narrow road along the coastline is the main thoroughfare through this small, coastal villa.  A handful of shops and houses sit along the edge
of the roadway, which is comprised of seashells and sand, crushed and compacted over time by weather and foot traffic.  The sounds of laughing and yelling can be heard coming from a small, somewhat ramshackle building that sits just off the road to the west.  A weathered sign hangs from above the door of the building.  
[Exits: north south west]

You yell in common, blondely, 'Wait!'

At a Dead End in the Road
The road of crushed shell and rocks dead ends here.  A few wooden docks have been constructed along the waterline just to the east, and small buildings have been constructed along a narrow road which leads off to the north and south.  The air here is humid and breezy, a slight smell of salt lingering on the winds.  The shrill cries of seagulls can be heard from nearby.

Main Street
The main street of this crude fishing village contains all the shops and many of the residential buildings.  Some appear to be built into the cliff located to the west.  Others line the water, many with boats moored alongside wooden docks.  Although the town appears sleepy during the day when the fishermen are out to sea, its livens up when they arrive home with their catches.  A general store, selling all kinds of odds and ends, is located to the west.

The road continues to the north end of the tiny village.  The hillside wraps around toward the sea to the north and several ramshackle houses stagger up the slope.  The smell of fish is strong here and several small fishing boats are docked outside a weathered structure to the east.  A sign above the door indicates a fish shop, probably the freshest fish available in miles.  A sandy track leads to the west.

Town Well
A small pond is located slightly up the hillside northwest of town.  Surrounded by white stones, carefully placed by the townfolk, the artesian well provides the village with fresh water.  Small bubbles break the surface of the clear, cool pond.  A wooden cup sits nearby for thirsty visitors.

You think in siri 'Asa Asa come back soon. I'm not really all that much when you're not around. And then I forget who I am and turn into a wolf or seagull instead, and that's nice. But I'd rather be Asa's Shulei than a wolf or a seagull.'

You feel somewhat different.

Shulei clambers up and looks down the well.

Very, very slowly, you holds the doll out over the open well mouth, his hand beginning to tremble more and more noticably as he does so.

A burning sensation seems to creep into your head briefly, then leaves as quickly as it came.

You think in siri 'It was a present from Caym... maybe if I give it back to Caym... Asa will come back?'

A flock of noisy seagulls has arrived from the east.

Shulei starts at the arrival of the noisy gulls, falling backward and staring up with wide eyes.

Shulei hugs the doll to him, burying his nose in it and breathing it in. But when he raises his face the tired lidded heaviness of his eyes suggests it has failed to comfort him this time.

The Battlemaster's Plain
The rocky ground underfoot has seen a disturbing level of wear and
damage, evidenced by scorch marks, ash, and craters from extremely violent
battles.  Several beings mill about here, preparing battle.  However, the
plain is not littered with the bodies of fallen, and the host assembled here
appears to quite a vicious assemblage.  The rocks seem to look jagged in
many places, having been broken and abused while battles continue to rage
on.  Sounds of whispers can be heard in the wind, almost as if calling out
those standing to come take a challenge.  Dark clouds hang overhead,
blotting out the illumination of the sun and casting a massive shadow across
the length of this field.

look
A Money Changer's Room
A few strategically placed lanterns keep this place well-lit in the absence of any windows. The room is surprisingly well appointed with tapestries hanging on the walls.  It is rumored that the changer's guards are behind them.  The moneylender himself works from behind a large desk and is keeping a small fortune in gold and silver.  A small sign hangs from on the wall, lettered in common.

There is a slim and toned human here.

Standing here is a slim yet tall human.  The hair on this human is a glimmering yellow, apparently kept very tidy by this person.  His eyes are the color of the sky on a sunny day and they are framed by well trimmed brows, long and blond in length.  His face can be considered angular yet the soft curves give him a slightly feminine look. His nose is perfectly straight, laying in the midst of his visage while his lips are soft, the upper a little larger then the bottom.

His body is slight in form, yet extremely well toned.  He appears to keep it exceptionally fit with slight striations of muscles peeking from his clothing. His hands are slender in size with well manicured finger nails. His legs and arms are long and supple, with slight muscles bulging from them.  His torso is exceptionally well defined, with the vestigates of a slight six pack showing when his clothing stretches across his flat stomach.

You say to Christophen in common, in a level monotone, 'It would be a pleasure to make yours, if not for that unforgivable abuse of colour. Why purple? Of all the sainted colours in the world.'

Renard eyes Christophen's hand rather guardedly as one might eye a snake.

Christophen says to you in common, in a soft and cultured tones, 'Because it is the color that my beloved preffers, and I shall make sure my clothing will remind him of his love for the shade...you know..my hand does not bite..please do shake it, it is quite soft.'

Christophen sighs slightly, his other hand moving to caress his cheek before holding it out to Jared.

You say to Christophen in common, in a level monotone, 'This hand custom of yours is not familiar to me.'

Jared lays his cheek into his masters gloved hand before nodding several times, his pink tainted lips offering a small satisfied smile.

Christophen holds out his hand, turning his head away from Jared and you.
 
Renard uses this opportunity to scrutinize the back of Christophen's hat.

Jared bites his lip, looking ever so mournful as he pats the gloved hand gently.

Christophen yells in common, in a soft and cultured tones, 'Oww! Oh Gods that hurt!'

Christophen says in common, looking back to Renard, his lips still quivering in pain, 'Oh, sir Renard you are ever so kind, I can see you also feel my pain..I thank you sirrah'

Your skin feels soft again.
You feel less durable.

(the less durable bit came BANG on time, I might add.)

Christophen says to you in common, in a soft and cultured tones, 'Do support the cause, I shall go to the printers and have the parchment written post haste!  Today we begin the Age of Sebian!'

You say to Christophen in common, in a level monotone, 'You just did it again.'
You say to Christophen in common, in a level monotone, 'Fare well.'

I have a feeling lots of people, not just Valithel and Ren, want to stretch Thian's smile right off his face. 'pullcheek' should be a valid social.

"event","posted because I'm sure you could all do with a prissy siri disdainfully flipping his hair at you more often.

<lj-cut text=""renard d`urfe"">
<b>a) name</b>
Renard D'Urfe - french for fox, and Dogfoot D'Urfe is a vampire technocrat guy, shamelessly based on Vampire Hunter D, whom I liked to draw. Ren is prettier than Dogfoot, but Dogfoot was *cough* MUCH taller. Ren is kind of ... imagine chibi Vampire Hunter D.

<b>b) class</b>
enchanter, because I was determined. god forbid that I should ever be determined again >:O!

<b>c) short description</b>
a bone-white, rake-thin siriyu

<b>d) long description</b>
Pale and narrow like a greyhound, he is built like a sickly sapling, and even his skin is the unnatural colour of bleached bone. His long fox-eyes are set deep in a face like a marble mask, and seem shuttered even when wide open.

His hair is long and black, worn in a complicated knot of tucks and curls behind his head. Stray locks frame his face like tendrils of shadow, accentuating the total lack of colour in his skin. His hands are also exquisitely cared for, nails glossy and claw-long. The detail of attention to his appearance and the cunning, dark slant of his eyes suggest that if he does toil, it is mostly with his brain.

The carriage of his head is proud and high, even if light sometimes appears to fall directly through his frail flesh and skin.

<b>e) worst enemy</b>
the high priest in the Santina monastery who blinded Ren TWICE. though surprisingly Ren managed to grope his way back to the healer (grumbling all the way). I swear he knows Seria better than his hometown.

Thian's zombies keep hitting on Ren too, but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now.

<b>f) most trusted companion</b>
he likes Eisle, shares bedrolls with Val (not really by design, but hey) and I actually think he's rather fond of grumbling at Thian. he doesn't really trust anyone though. I'm quite determined to corrupt him if I don't metrosexualize him too horribly first

<b>g) Favorite piece of equipment</b>
his staves! the shiney one he and Thian had so much trouble killing the high priest for (and then he found out it was a LIGHT, and threw a tiny, furious tantrum) and the fancy one with engravings from City of The Gods, which he saved and leveled up so painstakingly for, and then the first thing he does when he gets it is to enchant it so that it becomes.. yes, one level higher. I had to stay on and level him so it wouldn't poof. *is absolutely champion at poofing things*

<b>h) most often used fatality</b>
just 'murder', though he'd love 'vaporize'. no blood on your armor that way. do you know how much dry cleaning cost in the 17th century?

<b>i) possible love interests</b>
well, there's this other enchanter he tries very hard to please.. and no, it's not Val. xD

<b>j) place most often to be found</b>
- holed up in either the Pelican or the cellar, practising spells and littering;
- whacking and banishing ogres up high on Mt Booars (and the occasional passerby);
- gating to you when you least expect (or want) him to.

<b>k) religion/god</b>
none yet, but see below.

<b>l) the title you SHOULD have</b>
Renard D'Urfe, His Prissiness The High Priest Of Fashion (Also Priest Of High Fashion) And Superior Hair Treatment.

Library
Compared to the rest of the castle, this room has been infused with a dim
interior.  This semi-darkness provided by this windowless room protects the
book from damage and other extremities.  The only light provided comes from
the soft glow of mage lights hung strategically through the room and the
small mage fire burning brightly within the marble fireplace to the east of
the room.  The large fireplace gives a gothic grandeur to the room, and
above hangs a painting that depicts the God of Knowledge.  Despite this, the
light barely seems to shroud the room with visibility, giving it a heavy
atmosphere that bears a silence and tranquility.  The walls are papered in a
deep wine color that enhances the ambiance of the room.  Lining the walls
from ceiling to floor are massive bookshelves of oak filled with books, tome
and scrolls of every shape and size covering a wide range of subjects.  The
floor has been covered with a thick and ornately designed carpet made from
soft oranges and deep reds.  Scattered throughout the room are various
stuffed chairs and couches made from a plus, red velvet.  To one side of the
room sits an oaken desk covered with various books and trinkets.  The double
doors to the west lead to The East Wing.  


[Exits: (west)]
     Oaken bookshelves line the walls from floor to ceiling.

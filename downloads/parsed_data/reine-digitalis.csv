"event","Jasmin cleaned all day yesterday. I felt bad because I wanted to help, but she wouldn't really let me, so I settled for just snagging my stuff when she wasn't looking and putting it somewhere less in-the-way. I'm annoyed about one thing, though... the last *real* cigarette I had disappeared during the cleaning process. I'm gonna order more today, and, in the three weeks until they get here, become better friends with M. Orchid&eacute;e, even though his cigarettes are practically air sticks compared to real ones. 

Heehee... I owe Petit Lapin one for the brewer thing. Jasmin wouldn't let me *touch* it, but that worked out just as well. *goes to IM whoever's on bar today*"

"event","Jasmin isn't anywhere near as annoyed about the brewer as I thought she would be... maybe if I'm lucky, she'll let me <strike>play with</strike> fix it. She's bound to be in a good mood after tonight... the trap is set, here comes the net! *giggles*

Today was a good day. M. Touga came by to pick up Jasmin for lunch (he reminds me of M. D&eacute;gaineur for some reason, only not as constantly peeved), and his sister, Mlle. Nanami, hung around the shop for a while, along with one of her friends, M. Suwabuki. They're funny... he's obviously got a huge crush on her, and I'm not sure but she *might* have one on him. Neither of them seems like the type to say anything about it, though... I may have to do a little bit of poking around about that one. I made nachos for dinner, and M. Ombre came over. He and Jasmin went to Casa Blanca for a while, checking out the competition. Heck, what competition? We're better than them and we know it *grin*.

Ack, it's getting late. Bedtime for petites digitales, at least until M. Oignon shows up again... hehhehheh."

"event","Jasmin brought something home last night, and it wasn't M. Oignon (they're still fighting)... she thinks I don't know, but I do. What, is she afraid I'll break it or something? No, because then she wouldn't leave it where Millie could get to it. Hmph. Use one portafilter as part of a bootlegged DDR pad and you're never trusted again. Speaking of M. Oignon, though... if he doesn't stop trying to get into Jasmin's room at night, he's either going to break the trellis or she's going to pay M. Poignard to do something nasty to him. Heck, *I* might pay him to soon, waking up every five minutes all night long isn't my idea of fun.

M. D&eacute;gaineur came into the shop after babysitting today... those children are going to be the death of him. I can relate, though; I had Corrinne for most of today, and she's about as weird as they are. I can't complain about her too much, though... it wasn't terribly long ago that *I* was her age.

Eep. Millie's crying. I wonder what she broke?"

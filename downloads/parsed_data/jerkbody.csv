   today we are going to go to salmon creek and go hiking and swimming and sitting and eating. it should be rockin'.
nothing really interesting is happening. i end my job on friday and get paid on the same day. then 10 days off. oh yah!
i am getting really exited about camp.
it is really weird. sometimes i think i don't have enough friends but then i realize the good friends i do have are really solid and would do anything for me. i guess that is all you can hope for when everyone love to stab each other in the back on a daily basis.
hah listen to me!
i threw a party for my little brothers 20th b-day the other day. the rents were at Live Oak so they told me to have a party...so i did. it was very successful and fun. thank to all who came and made it nice.
fuck the rest of you.

"event","it has been forever since i have been to this web site. it is really weird and it seems like i am not as excited about it anymore as i used to be when i first began this quest in PDX.
i went to the swap meet this morning and i scored a record of science fiction sound effects (for the mix-tapes), some bob dylan, some square toed boots, and a kafka book for .75 cents. i love the swap meet. it had been way to long since i have been there and oh how i missed it so.
i have been hanging out with this girl named stephanie. she is actually a girl i dated years ago and i think there is something forming again and it makes me happy but of course it makes me scared also. because behind my strong appearance lies a scared little boy who fears his own shadow. it feels good to admit that.
i am going to go to school and probably end up in the city by the end of fall semester depending on what is happening.
we have not hot water right now and  i only takes cold showers after i have been hiking and was crawling through poison oak.
we went camping in big sur for three days and it was a very successful endeavor endeed.

in about one hour i saw just about everyone i know.
it was really cool but a little much for me to handle in such a large dose.
i went to ""pint night"" at this pub called the frog and peach. you buy a glass and then beer is two dollars all night, no matter what you are drinking. it's a fucking deal.
anyway, i was wondering where lots of my friends were and i found them there. more like they found me. it feels good to be loved again.
tonight we are having a bonfire at the beach and there will booze (from the grocery store) flowing and lots of drunken swimming, for me anyway.
yesterday i jumped into the ocean and it felt great. i also watched the sun set on the ocean. something i have not sen for a while. it was beautiful to say the least.

i think we got kicked out of two bars after that, i don't usually get kicked out of places but then again it probably wasn't my fault. it never is.
i ended up in some art studio at five in the morning drinking and painting with some dudes i met at hobos. it was rad. i woke up on my friends couch at like noon and was covered in blue and black paint. it was on my face, shoes, pants...fucking everywhere. that shit don't come out either. i also had some long poem written on various places on my body. it was in silver ink. the majority of it was written on my stomach. all for the sake of art man.
today i feel like smoking a lot and packing up.
i am never going to drink again.
i miss old friends but hate reminiscing.
i want to submerge myself in the sea.

i rented it because it was recommended to me and i really enjoyed it. i was totally engrossed. the whole film was really white and shiny, and the story is really fucked up, good times for all.
 last night i went to the ""drunk Poets society"" at the Yamhill Pub. it was only my second time going to it and it will probably be my last, seeing as how i am moving away from Portland on saturday next.
Because the other night at bush gardens i finally got over my dreadful fear of karaoke i am now addicted. last night after the yamhill we went to the boiler room and sang. i sang and danced. i love the nights when you drink for free all night, simply because you have no drink in front of you. sometimes i like to do those social experiments and see how long i can party with out forking out a dime. usually it is the other way around but sometimes i have to bee nice to myself and let my friends take me out.
  for some reason i was so drunk last night that i was almost in a zen state of mind. i was just mellow and focused, or at least i felt that way, it is so weird when that happens.
 the scrabble tournament went off without a hitch. i don't think we stuck around long enough to see who actually won, but i had fun while i was there.
there are rats in pioneer square, they were scurrying around where i was waiting for the bus at the courthouse. it was kind of creepy but they are so fucking cute, them and their rabie infested fur. those fucking little bastards.

i got rejected from buying beer last night from Safeway. the lady said she could smell the drink on my breath. i had imbibed one PBR pint about half an hour earlier. so i bought some gum and walked out laughing. she made my cousin, whose transaction was already through, return the beer he bought and refunded hid money. it was a hilarious scene in Safeway. there was like ten people behind us with a lot of shit to buy. i guess it teaches me not to get friendly with the robot checkers at safeway after you have thrown a few back. from now on i will keep my mouth shut, they don't want to hear what i have to say anyway.
so in light of this event we decided to drive down the street to New Seasons and instead of purchasing a six-pack of PBR i decided to celebrate and bought myself a good six-pack.

i lied in bed for like seven hours yesterday and got a healthy fix of television and movies. i watched the Kids in the Hall ""tour of duty."" it was live on stage in Vancouver, B.C. it was Ok but it wasn't as streamline as there sketch comedy is on television. they had to pause for laughter and it took something away from there routines. oh well i got a kick out of it anyways.
i am trying to think of other things i need to do before i leave but i have not thunk any yet, so i will probably sit and read and do nothing. i know there are some people i need to see nut i have a whole solid week before my train (dad) arrives.
hope everyone is having a fun day at their works and homes.

  i went to the ""drunk poets society"" at the Yamhill last night. it was really fun even though i didn't bring anything to read so i just sat there and listened and got way too drunk, oh yah i had an apron on for some reason and wore it for the entire night. sometimes i suprise even myself. then we proceeded to Marys club and got more drunkererer and looked at naked dancing girls, always a good time. then ended up at billy rays, which was not a good idea to put it lightly. i need to not do that to myself, it is very abusive and i dont have a job so it is not smart to be galavanting all over town, wrecking my body.
so now i am in my PJs and watching some movies, i couldn't move for like three hours but now i am OK. forced myself to eat some top raman and toast and some coffee, a great combo.

i am sad because i thought the locust,DEP, and wragler brutes was tonight but i guess it is february...bummer.

i might not leave until the second week of february because my dad has some time off and wants to go skiing and pick me up to take me home. part of me doesn't really want to leave, but i need some sunshine and i really want to swim in the ocean and go surfing.

like Judy for example. she is one of the ladies that works in pricing. she i like the tribal elder of the pricing ladies and she love to bring food into and have work parties. one time she even fed me and jackee a really good salad. she had it left over from the previous night and she brought it work and fed us, it was incredible.

i went drinking with scott and brian last night, they are some friends of mine who i met at work and became friends with. they are super rad and stuff. we went to the good ole matador and i drank whiskey and shot billiards for a long time. the fucking juke box was not taking dollars and eating all my quarters, what a scam.
then we went to the verne and the jukebox worked and i played ice cube a whole bunch. after that it really doesn't matter what happened because i don't remember.

you know when you do some exercises, like push-ups or pull-ups or any other kind of variation of the ever so positive ""UP"" excercises...hold on that was run on. wait. OK here i go. say you want to do twenty-five push-ups. as you approach the end of that set you begin to hurt and feel really weak. but i found that if you tell yourself you are going to do 30 or more you trick yourself into not getting tired. of course i have not done this for a long time but i remember it from when i used to pretend i wanted to get buff for the ladies.
well my point was...as we near the end of any path in life, time seems to slow down and sometimes things just get harder to deal with. like right now i am working the last week of my current job and for some reason it has been harder this week than any week i can remember to get UP out of bed in the morning. but it is almost over so i will just trick myself and pretend i am not quitting so the next two days will go by in a snap.
oh Yah FUCK THAT PLACE!!!!!

i am eating homemade black beans and rice butrritos. they are damn fine and very flavorful. the only problem is i skimped on the tortillas last time i was in the supermarket. they are the worst tortillas i have ever had the the displeasure of using. not that they taste bad but only that they simply suck and will not stay together. so i am currently eating a plate of beans rice and cheese, with my fingers. and you know what, it tastes just as good this way.

i am sweating with anticipation for the scrabble tournament this sunday at the Matador. anyone and everyone should come out. it will be fun. i am not planning on doing very well because i will probably be drunk and cheering on my favorite team so i wont want to do any of that stupid thinking that is way overrated.

NO new the OC for three weeks. i do not know what i am going to do. probably die a horrible death and rot in my own guts.

i met Anica last night, she seems like a really nice girl. she gave me a ride to the bus mall and that was really nice.
  I got to the bus stop last night and i had like 50 minutes until the bus came so went to Yamhill Pub. i was already drunk because i had been drinking with Jackee for the last five hours. so bought a beer and about half way through it i almost passed out in it, so i got the fuck out of there and went back to the bus stop to try and fend off the maniacs that hang out near pioneer square after midnight. falling asleep in the bar should have been an omen for what was to happen next. finally the bus came and about half way home i passed out cold. i woke up up to the bus driver screaming in the intercom. ""Last Stop!!!!!!"" i guess he had yelled it like four times and i just wouldn't wake up. i was really far from my house and i had to stagger all the way home. it was good times.
despite what you may believe i had fun last night.
 This morning i made some coffee and everthing was going according to plan until i went back in there to fill my mug and realized i forgot to put the actual coffee pot in the coffee maker. so my coffe was all over the kitchen. i hate cleaning up stuff like that first thing in the morning.
i woke up thinking about crossword puzzles and scrabble. i think i was dreaming about them too. six days until the tournament at the matador. the social event of the season, don't miss it. i hope everyone is having a wonderful MLK Jr. day. especially the ones that have to work, hats off to you.

today i was sitting here and i realized i have no friends who would come over to my house to hang out with me. thats a weird thought, i always seem to be the one going out on exciting adventures, i guess i just live too far away from the few people i know in this town.
well thats depressing, lets move on.
  i rode my bike the other day for the first time in weeks and i felt like i was going to have a heart attack. i could not seem to take a full breath and my chest hurt really bad, it was kind of scary.
but after the paramedics recusitated me i went on to live in land of unicorns and candy canes and so the story goes.
 to whom it may concern: sorry i have been so weird, i think it might be stress or something, but, you know....
  one work week left and then i am free to wander to my little hearts content. probably taking the train to seattle for a couple days and then the Scrabble Tournament. that is the last thing iam waiting for to happen before the long trek home.
it sucks outside and i have a grip load of movies to watch so i think i might be staying in. but if someone tells me to do otherwise, i will. i am like a reed in the wind, twisting and turning, controlled by forces beyond my realm of thought."

The lineup for the show was, The Country Teasers, form England, The A-Frames, from seattle and The Hunches from portland. i paid for one beer at the bar and then realized that downstairs the beer was free. thus proving that if you act like you own the place you can get away with murder. actually i just pretended i was with the Hunches and got in for free and drank for free. it was pretty radical.
  The Hunches killed it last night. Hart brough a kiddy pool up on stage and hung out under for a couple of songs, then used it for a drum with his microphone under it. i bet the sound guy hates them, because they all turned up way louder than they were in sound check, it was great.
  I didn't watch the A-frames but they sounded really cool. they sang about math and logic and stuff, both good subjects.
  The Country Teasers blew me away. they are like weird indy rock with a country musc twang, hailing from all over the world but based in England. They played for a solid hour, then there was an encore which turned into basically another set. then near the end of that after all the members stopped except the singer, chris got on drums, sarah picked up a guitar, ben and hart helped chris with drums. some people from the audience got a hold of the keyboards and samplers and it was an incredible random isurgence, punk as fuck. this went on for a good half an hour and the other bands members got back on stage and kept playing. the bar finally had to shut it down because it could have gone all night. it was amazing.
   so i got home at three in the morning and woke up feeling like total shit, like a pile of it. so i called in sick, fuck it!
had some breakfast burritos and some coffee and life is good."

"event","as far as the day at work went it was shitty as usual. i got to go to all these rich peoples house and give them things that they bought that i could never afford. but thats everyday so who complaining, right?
t-minus eight working days left of it anyways. i cant wait.

considerably better when i got home.
now i am eating white rice and drinking green tea. sometimes you just have to have a simple meal to calm your nerves.
the OC is on tonight and by hell or high water iam going to watch it this week. last week i sat right here as OC was playing on everyone elses TV but mine. what a shame. tonight i will watch and i will say it is good.

i have to go to the evergreen laundromat tonight to dry my clothes becayse my dryer has been broken for over a month and we are too lazy to get a new one. evergreen used to be the place called Kinky's Cleaning Corner and i have heard nothing but horror stories about that place. when i went there, there was only one person in there. granted he was talking to himself but who doesn't from time to time.

my fucking back hurts, i need a Deep Tissue more than i have ever needed one."

"event","there is something extremely soothing about reading Rimbaud while you have an ass of a stranger in your face and the elbow of a another stranger in your side. crammed on a huge public combustion engine with nowhere to go but to another seat. it made me feel like i was on the metro in france or the subway in new york, even though i have never been to either of those places.
i feel that time wares thin for these purple mountain majesties and these amber waves of grain ( if there are any of those left that have not been tampered with so they can grow bigger than nature intended them)
as technology advances our attention spans retreat and and our ability to communicate to one another is sparse at best.
so many times i want to talk to that person on the bus, but all those times i realize that i am afraid to approach them. i know people who have the opposite problem and i understand the feeling of someone talking to you when you do not want to be spoken to.
what was my point?
i don't know.
they say time is on our side and i am beginning to believe it.
we win when we die and sometimes it is a hard fucking contest with too many winners to award any prizes.

They are conquerers of the world
Seeking their personal chemical fortune;
Sports and comforts voyage with them;
They carry the education
Of races, classes and of animals, on this  ship
Repose and dizziness
To torrential light
To terrible nights of study.

-ArthurRimbaud (Motion)

it is funny when what we are reading so much shadows what we are seeing."

"event","today i as i sat around my cold house wondering what i had done with my friends, i realized that i want to watch a movie about samurais. so i did.
the criterion collection has a trilogy simply called Samurai. they are from the 50's and are simple and beautiful. some of makes no sense but i guess that what i get for being stupid.
made some mix tapes and stayed in my PJs all day. this is my day off from work and i did nothing. it feels great to not leave the house but at the same time i think i would lose it if i did it two days in a row.
soon i might move back home. i quit my job and need some adventure. going home will not necessarily provide for me the adventure i need but it would be a change. not for sure going to move  but for sure going to take an extended leave of the Pacific North West.
i am going to visit seattle before i head south, then to San Fransisco and home. maybe even further south.
life is hard with all these decisions but i suppose it is the way it got to be."

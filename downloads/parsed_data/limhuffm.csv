"event","&nbsp;Well I tried to put pictures up, but hopefully next wednesday i will be able to since I will be in the keys. I am in San Ingacio, and I haven't had access to a computer since Corozal, I don't have too much time because I was suppose to leave about 8 minutes ago, but its always hurry up and wait. I have to get my passport renew today. 

On Sat, I had to walk three hours though ankle deep mud, and water, and cow poo. Luckly however, the lagoon is flooding, and maybe by next weekend we will be able to take a boat in and out.

I have been excavating on Allisons mound, and I have found tons of stone tools and ceramics, although Chris found human bones last week, so he is working on the burial. Its been a lot of fun, better than working in the lab.

San Ingacio is really pretty, and we stayed in an air condition cabanna (shocked) with cable, and actual beds, warm water and shower with pressure. And there is another field school that stays here all the time. We made them feel lucky for what they had since we have to stay in tents or hammocs.&nbsp; I have more pictures, but i can't post them right now. 

Well I have to go load my stuff in the back of the 15 person van that 17 have to fit in. Lots of Love!! I am having loads of fun despite all of the hardships :)"

"event","Well today is the first day that I have had internet access, and I forgot my camera. So no pictures :(

 Well I was starting to dig and it was dry until this week when the lagoon started to 
 flood, so we have been banished from camp yesterday May 31, until at least monday, if not 
 more, so we are now at the beach in Corozal. We can't dig in the rain, and since I have 
 been sick, I was a bit disappointed that&nbsp; my first day digging has been cancled, although 
 the beach is a great consolation prize!!!
 
 If it keeps raining, then we are going to dig at Croc land, becuase they want to build a 
 park there, and they found some maya stuff when they were bulding so they have to now 
 have an archeaologist come out and look at the site.
 
 I am covered in bug bites, very itchy. I am not sunburnt, but i did have the pleasure of 
 having a sunburn with bug bites, which wasn't very fun!! I have learned that if there is 
 a bug it will bite you, and i have had some intresting bug bites. I didn't bring my 
 camera with me to the internet, however i will be here until at least monday!

Lisa, I am going to try to give you a call this week to find out if you had your baby yet!!! 

I will talk to everyone later, lots of love to all!!!"

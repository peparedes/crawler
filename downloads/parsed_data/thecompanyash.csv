"event","I knew this day would come. I knew, eventually, someone would pass me some sort of virus, and here it is. I can no longer speak, my eyes are watering uncontrollably, and my head is pounding. Of course, universities are a prime breeding place for disease.

If someone would fetch me some tea, I would be <i>mighty</i> grateful.

Oh, and it seems I missed a stripping session in the halls. Lovely, just lovely.

Note to Self: never ever venture out of the dorm room without a firearm present.

It seems we are stuck together, and as much as I protest, it seems we will be seeing each other quite often. So, as a result of this, I suppose I <i>owe</i> you can apology. However, don't expect me to socialize with you."

"event","Oh, I do <b>apologize</b>. It seems that this network is full of <b>busy-bodies</b>. Oh lovely. Perhaps next time you should learn to keep yourself out of a situation that doesn't concern you.

Yes, I do believe that would be a <i>wise</i> decision on your part.

"event","I demand a private room.

This establishment does not seem to understand the severity of the situation. I require a private room to preform duties for my business back home. Thus, I cannot have some infestation hovering over me when I am trying to calculate finances and what-have-you. In conclusion, if my room is not changed in the next twenty-four hours, I will seek else where to live.

P.S: Consider any funding terminated until this is resolved."

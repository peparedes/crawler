seeing her see everything is like me seeing it all for the first time (whoa lots of seeing. who needs a thesaurus?) and i feel all in love again. in love with portland. 

i am terrified of so many going-ons in my hometown right now. pple i love are falling apart. and me. i am fine. so fine that my problem is getting bored with so much fineness. complain abt the weather, then. or work. complain that i worry abt the fineness eating me up. but back home. dear god such madness. such fucking bastards. i want call up some pple and say ""you ssssuck, mister"" and hang up. my sister was saying how the pple she was living with (long story) got all mad abt her like having her feet on the couch or giving her boyfriend their tylenol. stupid shit like that. i forgot how dumb pple are. yr
 couch is a bunch of cushions. yr possesions are THINGS. nothing really matters, so calm the fuck down and stop wasting the time you are Alive with meaninglessness.

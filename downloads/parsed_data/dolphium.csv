No light...it gets power via USB..Ive tried it on 3 different computers and no luck...ok? Well I write to support last friday night. Tuesday I get a message back...the guy says ""Are you sure you have it plugged in? Is it plugged into a USB hub..and are you sure THATS plugged in?"" Well dumbfuck, if I didnt include the fact in the first post to you saying that ive tried 3 different computers as well as a omg...fully plugged in USB hub...then WTF do you think im doing with it? ""um no sir, I tried hooking it up to the microwave!!!"" Geeze...peoople are a dumbshits with IQs of -0.9..Is that possible? ONLY IN AMERICA! Im sick and tired of going to some store like bestbuy and circuitcity only to have people that know absolutely nothing about technology asking me if I need help.

Yea, thats right. See, the problem is, I dont exactly HATE America, I hate the people in it as well as the people its run by. I think politics is crap and nothing good can come from it. So...yep! I hate it. People are always complaining about people not voting, and yet, what I learned in highschool was that people had absolutely nothing to do with it.Quite frankly, I dont give a damn. Never have, neverr will. Not like I or anyone else can make a different anyway..right? :P

Today my mate bought me a white Nintendo DS only because she bought herself one last week and loved it so much that she wanted to play with me via the wifi. My opinion, it kicks ass that Nintendo is more worried about keeping the people happy than filling their wallets with crazy shit like having to buy extra this and that just for the damn console to work. I bought Children of Mana ('v been a good fan of the Secret of Mana series ever since I met my mate. Specially cause its an old SNES game) and I got Megaman ZX, which is pretty cool. Always loved Mega Man too. Yep...and in the wee hours of the morning last night I found out that VNV Nation is coming to Atlanta April 14th. Tickets are only 18$ so im freakin out. Only problem is, ive never been to a concert..Much less anything club like :P So im kinda like..eh...but I so wanna go. Furry Weekend Atlanta is coming up soon..I wouldnt mind going..It would be my furst (hehe) furcon ever attended. So...I gotta come up with a good reason to let my grandparents let me go that weekend. Im sure it would be awesome. And 2, the ranting gryphon is suppose to be there. So its gonna be cool!! Well, im sitting here now eating my Chef Boyardee Sketti and Meatballs and bout to play some Ninety-Nine Nights on the 360, Enjoy!

Considering I dont even like Yoda..or starwars for the fact..this is just about it. Thanks goes to foxie for the quiz..its been a while since ive posted any. As boring as they seem to be..*nodnods* Yep..ive seen to be doing something productive lately.. me and my mate have been doing random requests for char drawings and stuff on www.Furaffinity.net so it seems to be doing pretty good. Since she works 8 hours 6 days a week, i manage her account and the like. Yep..Check it outsometime. Maybe we might do something for ya. Www.furaffinity.net/user/sinarissoftpaws/ Hope that works, if not, just check for my account on google and youll see a link. Yep. My xmas wasnt too bad. Could have been better if I would have gotten a call from a certain someone..but it never happened. *sighs* but you know how that goes. Sorry for no posts. I still feel like theres not many out there who seem to look upon the randomness that I post. I picked up a new keyboard the other day. Got one of those Logitech G15 Gaming Keyboards..So its pretty cool. I can type stuff all comfy and stuff and In style! *nodnods* Ill talk to you guys later.

Im gonna try my best to get into college in Jan at West Georgia Uni. Its relatively close and i can pretty much get everything there i want i suppose. So yea..besides that not much is really going on. Ive lost just about all contact with about 97% of everyone ive once talked to so ive slowly started the painful process of getting new fureinds. Which things is working out so far. But what happens happens right? But today ive realized that my mind is still like its always been. I still think of all the good times that ive had with a few special people. But whats there to do about it? i like thinking about it. One day i plan on helping, im gonna try my best to. those of you who know who you are, im gonna help, but its gonna take some time. yep....But then again the cold winter air grows ever closer, and i cant wait. Because winter rules! tired of all this damn hot weather. *nods* and im open for chatting if anyone plans on it, im thinking to try something different, maybe get off aim for a while and talked with the people on the phones but i dont knows.

Its typed out and all but i feel its too personal to just randomly post up on this hellish place for everyone to look at when they get bored. So if your intrested , just give me an IM or something. But the highlight of the whole vacation is that i have finally got around to touching a phin. She may be wild but I think that makes it even better. How many people really get to experience their first phin in the wild? Well i feel lucky anyway I put it. So yea. It seems that everytime I look around I can see just how drastic everything has changed. It seems i talk to about 4 at most people that i spoke with close to everyday. Just about everyone from IL is gone. Actually, everyone from IL is gone, i know 2 people that still manage to pop up and say hi every so often. Its odd seeing everyone go their separate ways but what can i really do about it anyway? Excuse my typing, im having to use my middle finger besides my index due to that huge band-aid.

If you were wondering just where i wondered off to, well..i wandered off to the western part of the U.S. woohoo right? i guess... It wasnt too bad, was a LONG trip with ALOT of driving. I went with my grandparents as well as my girlfriend/mate (or whatever you peoples choose, had lotsa fun none-the-less )We put 3000 miles on the rental car we got..so you have to think about that. We flew into Las Vegas, drove up to Salt Lake City, Utah..stopped by the Grand Canyon (quite cool if i must say) then continued up toward Yellowstone National Park. It itself was one of the best parts of the trip. Nothing like the smell of Sulfur and the heat of 180F degree water boiling at your feet :P  After Yellowstone, it was back to Salt Lake City, then out toward San Francisco. (which happens to be one of my fav cities). From there we started down the coast *shivers* yea...it was freezing. Atleast compared to me that is. We rode down, stayed a night in Santa Cruz, which was insanely laid back considering the massive amount of teenagers that seem to roam the streets. Ate at some fancy place, ended up eatin a whole lobster..was good! From there we travled down to Montery, CA. Also another town i like quite well. We stayed there for two days to get a look at the aquarium that they have there. So if you wish to check out some of the pics i took, lemme know, theres about 500 of em. Got some cute otters on there. Well, on the way from the aquarium we ran by Laguna Seca, (a very famous race track formally known as the Mazda Speedway). From there, we headed to...yep..Death Valley, and i must say..you think 120F doesnt seem too hot, then well...the only way to experience it is to go there yourself. I could not even comprehend just how hot that was until i was there. Id hate to know what the people must pay for the air conditioning there. Theres actually people who have houses out there in the middle of the place. After sweating enough water to fill a cooler, we arived back in Las Vegas and stayed there for 2 days, eventually going to see the Hoover Dam, which was cool, really really big..But hey, ill post more later tonight (maybe)"

But it was a state competition so i feel as if i got SOMEWHERE, but i do feel as if i could have done way better. I placed 2nd last year. So not much loss. 

Other than that..not much big news. Two weeks of school left until graduation so...not much going on...im dead tired agter today thats why im gonna slip off now.

"event","Im sure you've all felt that feeling before. That feeling of sadness you get when your talking to someone and just the way they reply to your messages that you feel like your bother the fuck out of them. Even if your trying your best to be friends with them. Well thats how im feeling right now, and its bothering me. I found a local fur a few weeks back that does an excellent job at making fursuits and the like. So im waiting in line to get me a tail. Considering walking around with a phin tail on would look plain out weird ill probably get a fox tail. My mate has a white wolf tail that looks quite nice. She wears it around the mall and such, its not bad looking at all..so im in line now for my own.

In other news, silver got back today, or yesterday, not sure but i talked to him first today after the long 6 months that hes been gone, and i must say, not much has changed with him. Which is good. other than the annoying Warcraft stuff that seems to limit my conversations with him and everyone else to a minimum. Im not so sure whats so great about the game, but not having anything other than dailup, well...im sure you understand. i know its been a while since ive posted and my false attempts to update just dont work. I guess any of you that actaully read this forsaken thing will just have to wait until im in these kinds of moods to post..right? well on other news, i racked up on a massage stash of games at a salvage place up close to where i  attend my Votech clashes.. i ended up getting:

<b>PC</b>
Swat 4 $2.99
Half-Life 2 $2.99
Nexus: The Jupter Incident $9.99 
Silent Hill 4 $9.99 
Chronicles Of Riddick $5.99

<b>Xbox</b>
Soul Caliber 2 $2.99
Toca Racedriver 2 $2.99
True Crime: Streets of LA $1.99

 and i got Mario Kart: Doubledash for like...$5.99
for gamecube..and ive got all these games pretty much brand new..so it kicks some aft..abut anyway..enough with me, im back off into the void..until..nexttime..

4 hours i got back from a birthday party a friend of mine had..was more like a gaming marathon if you ask me..i ended up staying up till around 6:30am this morning and then waking up at 10am..so im going on that sleep..i know that doesnt mean jack shit to anyone that reads this considering that immmm sure they are better and stay up till 6:31 and wake up at 7am to get only 30 minuntes of sleep! omfg way to go for the people that think they are the shit...annnd im not being mean. im just tired of this and that from people...and now onto more frustrating subjecsts, im getting myself wrapped up in my mind trying to figure out the whole fucking college school crap..everyday im constantly being pounded say that college is going to kick my ass then rape me...well...i dont even know where to fucking start the shit...i havent even taken the ACT or the SAT...i plan on it soon tho..i just wish i could get away from all the people..because they dont make me happy...*sighs* why does it have to be so complicated?...

No one ever comes to these so called ""parties"" so yet again i was left with no one coming. Though of course my mate was there..so i suppose that was as good as anyone. Atleast i have someone to spend it with right? ok..now for the actualy rant. 1. I bought a 90$ power supply for my video card that was supposed to not be getting enough power through the rails..well i went from 13A to 34A so...i was happy...UNTIL it did the same problem. So it pissed me off so much i called tech support for BFG AGAIN! After a 46 minute talk, the guy finally assumed the graphics card itself is screwed. Well.....he tells me to send the card back..so thats what im doing..its going off tomorrow to hopefully get the shit beat out of it and i can get a new one from them. (no wonder they have a lifetime warranty) ;) so...im running the 5500 again...*sighs* the wonderful 18..im actually legal to do...well..nothing! so..good luck with this..and thank you all who remembered (nobody) buuuttt the ones that atleast wished me a good one once they knew :)"

First off, i bought a radio today..well...i didnt buy it..its a radio for my truck..i couldnt think of anything i want for my birthday so..i just asked for a radio that will actually play MP3s and WMAs. Im tired of that pos stock radio. Got a Alpine, so i hope it will live up to its name. Only problem is i wont get it until my birthday rolls around...(whoo for 18ness) i guess..to think that time has flew by so fast..its pretty crazy. Things are going quite well with my mate..so..im glad for that. Ive been thinkin about silver about, wondering how things are adoing out on the boat now. Sad thing is is that he wont be back until around march of next year. Thats so long from now! maybe ill get a letter or something, i worry about him sometimes...those of you that know him know how he thinks :P *yawns* oh the joy..another day of school tomorrow...well...dont know if you can call it that..because i go for only 2 classes and then i go ""interning"" around Carroll County. Its a shame i dont get paid for the stuff because it takes money to get around! goddamn gas prices keep going up and down...but anyway..enough ranting..i just wanted to update..if anyone needs to get in touch with me..they know how..byebye!"

"event","Well..things are looking up, finally finished the GHSGT (Georgia Grad Test) which was pretty easy..im glad its over tho, the tests were killing me..but the thing is that it asked questions that were like..WTF?? Evan said it was made for retards...so...he was right...so...thats it with the test

Well..on something even better..(ok now..most people that read my LJ might try to kill me for this) but theres actually a girl in one of my classes that well..pretty much likes me...of course shes a good friend of mine, but i have a feeling that maybe i should actually try somethign with her, i know the whole relationship thing prolly wont work but hell..i got a good snuggling today for an hour and a half in class from her :P maybe things might go well...after all..shes one of those girls thats 1 in a million..otherwise i wouldnt like her...right? and its strange..i cant help but think of her..she said she was grounded so..im not really expecting a call :P she was grounded for going to a concert when asked not to..merf..dont ya just love parents? tho i am hoping i can take her out to the mall soon..a date =)   butttt...ill just have to see how things go..as i told Swifty..i cant wait until tomorrow for school to actually see her..well..im tired..so i guess ill go now.."

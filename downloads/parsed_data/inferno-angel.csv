Today *clears throat* i went to Zin's house (so close) and then we met up with elsa to go to the city (again). it was fun!!! *delusion* we took sticker fotos (again again) and we took two but one of them was with a crappy machine so it didn't look good... T.T *glares at zin and elsa* And i kinda had to pay for elsa to suck her into taking the second photo. *more glares* But then we had takoyaki and it was ok...

went to zin's house after and i kinda got high...*note: it's not MY fault >_><_<* so yeah...well that's about it really... *hopes off and steals zin's doggy* hahahahahaha!!!! *runs off*"

"event","Saturday was pretty fun...even though there was about a hour or so when i was really bored. Didn't really buy anything though and i had to be taged like an animal or a mental patient, i mean it even had a number on it!~ Took a while to find Elsa and them when i got there but it wasn't that bad. The cosplay people were kinda *coughs and trails off* and Jessica almost fell asleep on the way back until she started to listen to rock songs and talk about all these bands with Kai and her sister...

Animania was pretty fun so i think i'll probably go next year too if it's not too near the time of the school certificate...don't think i'll volunteer though

And according to everyone Mendark is gonna leave...too bad we can't laugh at the girly jeans nemore and i'm finally gonna move soon"

"event","The holidays are pretty boring most of the time but who wants to go back to skool next week?! Not me~!
neways i have nothing to do in the second week but for the first week this is what really happened:

Monday~
went out with Zin and Els to Burwood to look around. Didn't really do much, then we went back to Zin's place and our pathetic attempt at table tennis was hopeless...^_______^"" i hit the lamp 5 or 6 times...^___^""

Thursday~
went with Tomo to Kinokuniya and she bought manga and NewType. The book i wanted was out of stock 0>_<0 damn~! after we took sticker photos and the little punk tried to choke me~! =P then we went back to her place

Friday~
went to Elsa's house to try to teach her how to use photoshop but her sis was online so didn't get the chance...and it was raining cats that day -.-"" we were all wet...

Saturday~
went to Campsie with my parents and got my ears pierced again! this time just one more on the right side...hope it doesn't infect or nething...

well that's pretty much it and Animania is coming up! well guess i can't wait...
and Nina, never call me at 9 something again!"

and 1 and 2 and left and right, 1 - 2, 1 - 2, single 1 - 2, double 1 - 2 

lol...it was funny. the only bad thing was that Sop got sick...again! this must be the forth time this year at least and she went home after that. I'd be surprised if her mom doesn't get her to get a blood test. Poor thing, I almost feel sorry for her.

AND WONG'S GONE FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK!!! YAY!!! YAY!!! And thanx for changing the layout of my lj Nina for the exception of a small little glitch. *cough cough* I knew I wasn't paranoid..."

I mean it's surprising that he's actually being in university! And why did the stupid cheap ass school hire HIM neways?! He sux for god's sake and no one noes what the hell he's going on about! Let the teachers sit through his lesson and see how the hell they like it!!! I wonder if I can get him fired...it's a good idea...even Mendark is better than him and Mendark's crap (though not as much as Wong) too! >_<"

Math is one of the worst subjects eva T.T It didn't even hurt so i don't know what Sop was complaining about and just yesterday Joanna asked us how that guy worked out the circumference of the earth and sop made that sheet of paper into a paper aeroplane and wrote he found the circumference because he was smart. WTH?! well she stuck that into his container full of chalk and stuff and he actually found it and read it...lol...hilarious.

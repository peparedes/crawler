"event","i love it when you have a line from a song as your msn display name or as your myspace headline or  on your livejournal or just typed up somewhere and then months or even a year can go by and slowly your friends pick it up when they hear the song. 

heck, the song featuring that line used to be my ringtone. up until yesterday when i got my new phone. 

so, i think it's time for me to change my msn ""name"" soon. cursive and i have had a great run, it's been fun but i think it is time to move on. although i noticed the other day (speaking of cursive), that both my cursive shirts (kerryn and i are possibly the only 2 girls in sydney, and possibly australia that own more than 1 cursive shirt) have their print on the bottom half of the shirt.

i keep txting / emailing owen whenever i see gay-f-i hair. and there is a guy at work who does it. cowboy boots and black, gay-f-i hair. and i keep giggling to myself.

"event","The end of my trip...

* So after Maritime I caught a bus to DC to meet my Mum and Dad. When I got off, they greeted me and the bus driver had told them that we eloped in Vegas. 
* Thought I lost my wallet in DC. Cancelled ALL my credit cards and my bank card. 
* My cousin found it in his pocket later on.
* San Fran. Went to Union Square for some shopping. Loved the bookstore near where we were staying.
* Hired a car to drive to LA and went to see the Full House house. The door had been painted black so it is no longer red.
* Sang cat songs on the way down to LA. 
* Shopped in LA. 80% of my CD shopping was just adding to my 90s indie collection. Not my fault nothing worth buying has come out since...
* Got hit on by Elmo.
* Met so many Aussies in the hostel we were at.
* Freaked out about the toilet / shower situation in our room (lack of privacy)
* Drove back up to San Fran and did the segway tour the next day. Segways are awesome. 
* Flew home and started work the next day and am sick of is already.

Photos to come soon.
When Nick gives them to me.

"event","Owen & Appleseed were on Tuesday night and that was an awesome show. Appleseed were awesomely beautiful. Mike Kinsella was amazing. 

We hung out talking to them after the show for ages, met some guys from a band called The Panic Division who were really really nice. 

Mike / ASC ended up staying at the same motel we were at after the show but we didnt see them as we were asleep by the time we got there. We saw their van the next morning!

I got my hair done in Austin and I love it! So much that I added the hairdresser to myspace! Lame! Nick got his hair cut and ended up looking like Tom. 

Thursday I went to Coney Island and got picked up by a jetskiier. He was really nice but too old for me. He was really smooth - and some of you know that I'm a sucker for smooth (michael <3). I was walking along the boardwalk taking photos of the beautiful everything. He approached me, kicking a can (anyone who knows me, knows can-kicking is something I cannot resist!) saying ""here, I'll pass it to you, and you pass it back"" and I said ""but it's too windy"" and he said ""just pass it back to me"".

So I did, then I tried to walk away but he asked where I was from, and we started talking. He owns a jetski rental business in Coney Island. Loves surfing. Loves the beach. Would love Australia. I met a few of the locals at the pub we were standing in front of, and he invited me to have a beer with the group and watch the sun set over the water of Coney Island. I ended up refusing because it was sorta freaky and also cos I had to get back to Jenny's. 

Today was Pittsburgh and let me tell you - Pittsburgh sucks! Not as much as Dallas, because a guy at the US Airways booth at the airport gave me a teddy bear whom I've named Captain Potato. Maritime tonight were awesome. Unfortunately it was seated and I couldn't get up and dance but it was great. I took photos. I hugged Davey, I spoke to each of them and they're all eager to see Australia. ""Maybe when we go to Japan"" ""We don't have a label in Australia"" ""Our first album did shockingly in Australia""... 

Davey said ""Maybe we'll try and hit up one of our more famous friends, like Jimmy Eat World. They did that split with that Australian band..."" to which I said ""Jebediah! Yeh, the Get Up Kids supported Jebediah!"" and Davey insulted TGUK (jokingly) and I said ""You're breaking my heart, TGUK are #2 and TPR are #1 but still, you're breaking my heart...""

I bought a Maritime onesie (for future kids I may have) and Dan D was so excited that I bought it.

Anyway, enough about that, I have photos to try and upload. I bought a new camera and I love it. His name is Davey, after Davey VB because I bought it specifically for Davey. 

This may sound really weird/insensitive/stupid but I saw the scars on Davey's head and it made me love him all the more for still making music and still being the most beautiful famous person I have ever famous-person-crushed. 

Goodnight y'all. I'm going to DC tomorrow so mommy can take care of me because I'm sick. 

P.s. Davey told me that there is a possibility that TPR may do another reunion show next year. Save your pennies lads and lassies. Nothing could ever stop me from going. If I have to quit my job then I'll do it. If i have to sell my car, damnit... I will do it. If it means I cannot shop for the next 6 months, by golly I will do whatever it takes to see the promise ring. Who is with me?

i found out that my aunty passed away in hong kong. my grandfather didnt even know she was sick. he doesnt know she is gone.
i can imagine all sorts of crazy arguments my cousin is having with her father right now, why don't they tell my grandfather that his first born is dead? 

i hate dallas. i love texas but not dallas. no one sells bread in dallas. i spent 45 min roaming the streets trying to find bread. nothing. lots of bums asking for money though. i hate dallas. 

i love san antonio though, i didnt even mention that we were treated like royalty at the MCS show... the security guards yelled out to us and let us cut lines ""hey australia, over here"". twas awesome.

not much to report cept i have done a few stupid things like taken too much money out of my ATM card when i was in sydney, i exchanged it all in LA and got a cruddy exchange rate. then i decided to transfer money from ING to my westpac to pay off my credit card and realised it was linked ONLY to my st george and to swap it to westpac is a pain in the A. so dad has to pay off my credit card and lend me money. 

then there was the toilet incident where it wouldnt flush and i had eaten junk food on the plane (as they ran out of sandwiches and salads, the jerks) and so you can imagine what that's like... and the toilet here, it is shallow with loads of water and so flushing too much while trying to unclog runs the risk of overflowing and well, eventually it flushed. but i panicked like i was at the disco. 

oh, and i think i may have gotten my period today. great.

"event","<i><big>Tanuki </big>(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
Tanuki is often mistakenly translated as raccoon or badger, but is in fact a raccoon dog. Tanuki have been part of Japanese mythology since ancient times. The mythical tanuki is reputed to be mischievous and jolly, a master of disguise and shapeshifting, but somewhat gullible and absent-minded.


Folklore
The wild tanuki has unusually large testicles, a feature often comically exaggerated in artistic depictions of the creature. Tanuki may be shown with their testicles flung over their backs like a traveller's pack, or using them as drums.

A common schoolyard song in Japan (the tune of which can be heard in the arcade game Ponpoko) makes rather explicit reference to the tanuki anatomy:</i>

Tan Tan Tanuki no kintama wa 
Kaze mo nai no ni 
Bura bura bura
<i>
Roughly translated, it means <b>""Tanuki's testicles swing back and forth even when there is no wind blowing.""</b>

Tanuki are said to cheat merchants with leaves they have magically disguised as paper money. Some stories describe tanuki as using leaves as part of their own shape-shifting magic. </i>

And that is how Tom Nook got his name."

nico's was a blast. we tried to avoid being the party poopers that no one liked at the party. 
nick was pretty drunk by the time we got there (we were the first ones there) and our presents seemed to rule the table of presents.

+ more alternative photography (more table chins + constipated looks + napoleon dynamite faces + zoolander faces)
+ flocked to the calamari rings + prawn cutlets like seagulls (some guy was like ""uhh they're prawn cocktails"" but i'm sure they're cutlets because a prawn cocktail involves a cocktail glass...)
+ made flowers from the streamers for nico
+ drank champagne and orange
+ cheered on zeb as he tried to pick up the barmaid...
- nick gave me a hug when he was good and drunk and then squeezed my ass. (note to nick: it was not just a normal squeeze but a full on grope)
+ when i wasn't scared of him anymore i made him open his presents and i must say, our presents kicked the asses of all the other presents. the red ukuele (named quagmire) and season 3 of 24 made him jizz his pants literally... his friend dave spoilt the surprise when he yelled out ""its a ukuele"" because he didnt think the present would be a ukuele. luckily nick's brain didnt click.
+ i fed nico cake and cleaned him up. 
+ got myself a little drunk when the bar was declared ""an open bar""...
+ two of nick's friends made me skull my drink and so i did and felt terribly ill but gave nico a telephono hug... 
- went to the wallaby bar and then tom felt sick cos it was too hot inside. 
+ random hugs 
+ went to the lansdowne for a bit then tried to catch a taxi home
- was abused by a taxi driver (and of course i abused him back)
+  met a guy named patrick who lives in leichhardt who we taxied home with (the reason why the first taxi driver abused us)
+ came home to a zeb trying to play the bass fast asleep on tom's bed
+ carried zeb back to his room and got him ready for bed. i tried to feed him water but spilt it everywhere.

"event","i have been having wonderful dreams lately. dreams are fantastic. they're like fluffy clouds in your head that float around and you just want to catch one and hold onto it for as long as possible and never let it slip through your fingers. 

this weekend i have <b>wanted</b> to:
* fall in love
* punch things. repeatedly.
* spend money
* sleep
* exercise
* go to see sailor style + the biennale <3<3<3

this weekend i have:
* dreamt about being in love (+ i hung out with my ""future mother-in-law"" in my dream <3)
* bashed up my computer keyboard. no punching. just fist shaking. 
* spent a large amount of money

<b>friday:</b> adam + i walked (exercise!). shopped. got lost in alexandria. ate footlong subs. watched the royal tenebaums.
<b>saturday:</b> kate + i shopped. most of the day was spent driving actually. and getting lost in bondi. nick + i played california, i miss you + to be with you. we ate dinner + watched gilmore girls. (sorry nick for snapping at you during gilmore girls!) owen + i hung out and watched a walk to remember whilst eating popcorn and m+ms. i drank 4 lemon honeys @ in 2 & 1/2 hours. 

i'm also quite in need of cash. i'm in debt to daddy and i want to buy plane tickets as well. brisbane. adelaide. but somebody owes me money but has conveniently left the country after telling me that he was ""broke""... its not much money but it will get me to brissie. 

i've bought so much this weekend (which is why i am quite moneyless). 
1 x black pinstripe mini skirt
1 x black + peach ruffle-y lacey mini skirt
1 x black halter neck dress which i'm going to double up as a top
1 x faded blue jeans
1 x knitted blue + black striped jumper
1 x faster pussycat black + pink argyle cardigan
1 x french kitty bag that i have been wanting to order off the internet for ages but couldnt bring myself to paying $30US postage on...
1 x collected works of edgar allen poe from 1927

time for a lemon honey kittens. thank you for listening."

i miss that feeling. 



owen and i went to jocy's yesterday. we had terrible cocktails. went to see the glamours. walked home. watched 6 hours worth of daria in 2 days. took me 5 hours to get home from jocy's (wollongong to caringbah via bondi via bundeena to look for deer)... 


owen bought me flowers yesterday too. sweetest thing ever <3
pink roses.

that's a horrible thing to say but its times like these you realise how much your friends care... even if its hard for them to express it, they always do it in their own little way <3 

the biggest shock was when <b>duncan</b> expressed his concern about my being ""emo""... i knew in his own little way, he was saying ""there there pickle, don't be so blue... you're meant to be green"". yay for getting old and being civil. i'll drop the farmland cola around when i come home ok?

the nicest surprise was getting a package in the mail from <b>kerryn wilson</b>. that was such a lovely surprise that i cried... you miss kerrynwillwin, will be getting a hug whether you like it or not! <3

and then this morning, <b>adam</b> dropped around at 6am in the morning to give me a mixed cd he made for me for brisbane. <3 that was the prettyist present, besides the bow kerryn did but then i took it out and i got sad cos the bow was so pretty...

and then there is the tons of hours <b>owen</b> spends reading my whinging, for which i feel he is the closest one to knowing how it feels... <3 & *hug*
and <b>jo</b> for being the one who calls me constantly to check up on me, not just now, but always... for the last 6 months, she's always called to check that i'm ok, she is like my big sister <3

and <b>chris</b> for coming over and cutting my hair and dancing to dirty dancing with me (do you love me? do you love me...;) and <b>jocy</b> for calling me because i dont think we talk as often as we should. and <b>brisbane boys</b> for letting me escape into their open arms... and <b>vicci</b> for offering me to escape into her arms which would currently be occupied by adrian you stupid happy couple *shakes fist*... 

there are plenty more that i havent mentioned... the list is too long.. and i love every one of you

apologies to <b>nick</b>, i know you're there for me but i've had so many other people taking care of me that you have the day off ;) you've taken care of me for the last 4 years anyways... its time for your long service leave... <3 i'm glad i could be there for you when you needed someone to talk to though. really i am. 

ok cats, 4 hours til take off. i need to go buy last minute things.

expect plenty of hugs when i get back kids. i love you all."

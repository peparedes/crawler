"event","<p align=""justify"">Bye to LJ for good. You knew it was coming.

Everyone that's added me, please take me off. I'm cleaning out my entire friends&communities lists.

I can't stand LJ anymore. It bugs me. I thought I could come back but I guess it didnt work. I tried but its like... boring&discouraging&stuff. GJ is loads better than this piece of shit site. Sure, this is huge&the ""original"" of journal communities, but no. The people are boring. The servers are slow. It's filled with boring&annoying people. It lags. You have to get a paid account just to get good features. Free users can't do shit. The site is so limited&gross compared to GJ. Screw it.

If I ever come back to LJ, it won't be til the end of the year for 2006. There's a 30% chance that I'll come back, but I really don't want to. I HEART GJ! <3!

But if you wanna hear stuff about yourself, read on.

<b>ALiCE ( <lj user=""ayuvolution""> )</b> You were sweet&stuff. You were kinda moody but oh well. You made awesome layouts, but you just seemed a bit too mature for me. We kinda got along but I think we found each other boring&it didn't click even though I tried to make it work. Good luck with whatever you're gonna do, since you've graduated from HS&going into college&whatnot. 

<b>AMBER ( forgot your username, cherry something XD! )</b> You were a good person. We didn't click though. it was pretty awkward x_____X!!!

<b>COREJ ( <lj user=""tokyoxjapanxfan""> )</b> Still coding your layouts&stuff! yeah we get along like bread&cheese xD!

<b>DES ( <lj user=""kisumaaku""> )</b> It's good, my LJ Virgo ;D.

As for Tiffany & Moni, they've ( thankfully ) moved on to GJ ;D.

GJ is a lot better than this piece of shit. More customization, SPEED! Plus a new start, it's growing fast. It has like 1,100,000 users or something. &2000 userpics&everyone has a paid account!?! HELL YES!!!"

"event","<p align=""justify"">I'm not updating my LJ anymore. I'm still around&commenting, but you know, LJ is boring. GJ has tons more thrills. If you want my username there, comment here, but I'll screen it. Other than that, you can catch me on <b>AiM</b> if I want you added. AKA Des & Corej!

I'm still commenting on your entries, so please dont remove me. Just dont expect updates from me anymore. You can still find my updates on AiM, GJ, && Myspace.

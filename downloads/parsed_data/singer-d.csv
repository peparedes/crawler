"event","I've watched the first three episodes of <i>The Invisibles</i> and I'm afraid I've found it very disappointing so far.  It's a poorly-written hour-long sitcom about an often unpleasant and unsympathetic middle-aged thief getting back into the game (Tony), and his idiot of a partner who's mostly written as a moron who can't find his own dick with both hands and a flashlight.  Except when they need him to be more intelligent, so they write him that way when convenient.  Bad plotting, bizarre characterizations, and the show can't make up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama, and consequently succeeds at neither.  There is no conceivable reason for the two men to be friends or partners, nor is it believable that the moronic Sid could ever have been an asset in a profession that requires any intelligence.  I don't envy any of the actors in this show.  Mostly they rise above the material, but they sure don't have much to work with."

"event","So I suppose you all know that ASH is starring in a new BBC series, ""The Invisibles,"" as an out-of-retirement professional thief.  Patricia at <a href=""http://www.headsupguide.com/"">HeadsUp</a> has put the first five episodes <a href=""https://headsup.dyndns.org/"">online for download</a>.  Has anyone who's downloaded them actually been able to play one all the way through?  I had to try three players before I found one that would play anything at all.  VLC Media Player reports the files as damaged and repairs them so they play, but cuts them off before the ends of the episodes.  Anyone else tried?  Or know where else they're available, perhaps as BitTorrent files?

My brief review after seeing parts of the first two episodes: Tony is his usually excellent self, but the show is rather pedestrian so far."

<a href=""http://bellatemple.livejournal.com/74994.html"">Heartbreak and Suffering</a> by <lj user=""bellatemple"">, Xander in Africa.
<lj user=""nemo_gravis""> started or encouraged this big <a href=""http://nemo-gravis.livejournal.com/100304.html"">70 Questions</a> in-character psych profile meme way back at the end of last year, and some of the entries were really very entertaining.  My favorite was <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/a2zmom/82476.html?#cutid1"">a2zmom's Buffy</a>.

Haven't had much time for LJ or fanfic, and had something of a reaction to a fanfic author's meme that was circulating here several months ago.  I'm not a writer so I didn't pay much attention to the writer's meme posts until I noticed that one of the questions was (something like) do reviews/criticism affect your writing, and the answer on the meme I was scrolling past was ""Never.""  That caught my eye - why ask for comments if you're starting from the premise that the comments you receive will never affect your writing, unless you're only fishing for compliments?  I wondered if that was a common answer and back-tracked every ""gakked from"" author in every branch of this meme tree I could find to see how other writers had answered the question, and except for one ""Rarely,"" the answers were all ""No.""

<lj-cut text=""Read more."">I admit this has stopped me in my tracks as far as writing any comment more extensive than a one or two sentence ""I liked your story.""

I never sing with the expectation that comments about my performance or material will not affect my decisions - comments and criticism have occasionally had a great effect on some aspects of my performance.  I'm not in the audience, the closest I can get is recording a concert and listening to it later, and that's not the same as sitting in the audience ""live.""  Certainly I give more weight to comments by other musicians, but I would never say that the reaction of an audience member will not affect what I do or the way I do it, especially if they make the effort to find me after a concert and tell me what they think, and take the risk of offending me by telling me they didn't enjoy a song, or thought that my performance could be improved.

Criticizing someone is difficult and you risk offending them in the process, which is why I never bother except when I both like and respect an author, and enjoy their story.  So to read these memes from the same people who are always begging for feedback saying that comments ultimately have no effect on their writing and that they don't expect them to (nor want them to, apparently) was a great surprise.  And, I'm afraid, have left me feeling that it's a waste of time to to offer concrit.</lj-cut>

Feel free to comment - I have excised the snarky bit about how your comments will not affect me."

This long ballad is a bit of a challenge, but worth the effort.  King Willie has married a foreign woman his mother doesn't like, and his mother has enspelled his wife to remain in labor and never give birth so Willie will be forced to marry another woman, presumably one his mother approves of.  The intelligent young wife comes up with a plan to trick her mother-in-law into revealing the spell to King Willie so it can be reversed.

<b>Ghosts</b> in folk songs often appear with some purpose.  They may need to be released from an oath, in many songs a plighted troth.  Sometimes the revenant manifests to accuse someone of a crime, or attest to the innocence of the accused.  In this first ghost song the revenant appears to his true love to accuse her parents of setting in motion the events that got him killed.  The late Helen Schneyer lifts her unparalleled voice on this song from her 1974 Folk Legacy album ""<a href=""http://www.folk-legacy.com/store/scripts/prodView.asp?idProduct=91"">Ballads, Broadsides, and Hymns</a>,"" accompanied by Jay Unger on fiddle.

There are many versions of this next ballad, including one you may remember sung by Peter, Paul & Mary back in the day.  A young man out hunting kills his sweetheart when he mistakes her, wrapped in her white apron, for a swan.  Some versions end before the revenant appears to clear her true love of murder.

Not a true ghost story as the dead sister does not manifest per se.  ""The Two Sisters"" is a centuries-old ballad of two sisters competing for the same man.  The song is said to have originated in Scandinavia, here's a Swedish version by ""<a href=""http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/f/F53.HTM"">Folk och Rackare</a>"" (Folk and Rogues), from their 1976 self-titled album, now out of print.  In this well-known song, one sister murders the other out of jealousy by pushing her into a river to drown.  The body of the drowned sister washes ashore downstream (often after the body is robbed of a golden ring by a villainous miller), where it is found by a musician, usually a fiddler or a harper.  The musician dismembers the body and uses the parts to build an instrument, usually a harp or a fiddle.  The ribcage or breastbone is used for the body of the instrument, the finger bones for tuning pegs, and the dead woman's golden hair for the harp or fiddle strings.  In some versions of the song the magical instrument can only play one sad tune and the song ends with this revelation, but in more complete versions the musician is hired to play at the murderous sister's wedding to the coveted man.  There the enchanted instrument miraculously sings without human intervention and accuses the sister of murder (and the miller of robbery if that theft is part of the song), the miller is hanged and the evil sister is burned at the stake.  I don't think the miller appears in this version, but it does end with the murderer being burned at the stake.

<b>Elves and fairies</b> are popular in folk songs.  The fae folk often abduct humans, and in those songs where the mortal returns he is usually irrevocably changed.  ""True Thomas"" is the name given to the protagonist in this song about a man abducted for seven years by the Queen of Elf-land, when he returns he is unable to lie and has the gift of prophesy.  Wikipedia has a good entry on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Rhymer"">Thomas the Rhymer</a>.

Joe Hickerson, former head of the Archive of Folk Song at the Library of Congress, sings a song from which most of the supernatural elements have disappeared.  In many if not most versions of this song, the fact that the evil knight is not human is preserved only in the title, and the lyrics give no hint.  The purpose of the elf knight beyond simple murder and robbery, if there is one, is not made clear.  The parrot at the end of the song represents Lady Isabel's conscience.

<b>Magicians and were-folk</b> are two other types of supernatural people found in traditional songs.  ""The Two Magicians"" recounts a battle between two magicians, male and female.  The virginal female magician refuses the advances of the male sorcerer.  Usually there's an element of attempted rape in the ballad, as there is here.  Sometimes the male magician succeeds in either raping or seducing the female, but in this version, ""She became a corpse, a corpse all in the ground, and he became the cold clay and smothered her all around.""

"event","Cross-posted here from <lj user=""audiography"">, for you few FL folkies who enjoy the traditional music I post.  Here's an appreciation of my favorite <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=%22hammered%20dulcimer%22&btnG=Google+Search&sa=N&tab=wi"">hammered dulcimer</a> band, <a href=""http://www.oldsongs.org/billspencemusic/biography.html"">Bill Spence and Fennig's All-Star String Band</a>.

<lj-cut text=""Many traditional New England style dance medleys here"">Why are they my favorite hammered dulcimer band?  Because they're a <i>dance band</i>, they play both concerts and dances, they know how to keep the beat, and they don't play the tunes too slowly.  Bill also doesn't over-ornament, a trap many hammered dulcimer players fall into.  Ornamentation can be beautiful if tastefully employed, but if over-utilized ornamentation turns hammered dulcimer tunes into a muddy mess.  This is real New England-style contradance music, although this group of ringers is from New York State.

Bill Spence burst onto the Northeast folk scene in 1973 with Fennig's debut album ""The Hammered Dulcimer,"" a self-produced album with Bill playing a hammered dulcimer he made, on the new Front Hall Records label.  It was FHR-01.  Front Hall would go on to become a small but important indie folk label run by Bill's wife Andy, who also owned and ran one of the biggest folk music mail-order stores in the US, <a href=""http://www.andysfronthall.com/"">Andy's Front Hall</a>; and runs (or perhaps ran) the <a href=""http://www.oldsongs.org/festival/"">Old Songs Festival</a> of traditional music in upstate New York.  I believe she just retired, Andy's Front Hall seems to have been closed and the label shut down although they're still <a href=""http://www.andysfronthall.com/paypal/fennigs.html"">selling Bill's albums</a>, now on CD.

Now you might think ""burst onto the scene"" is a bit of hyperbole considering the genre, but in fact they had what might be called (pun alert) an underground smash folk hit when the medley ""Gaspe Reel/Fiddlehead Reel"" was chosen as the theme music for Public Television's popular gardening show Crockett's Victory Garden, produced by WGBH in Boston.  Hundreds of thousands of people heard the tunes, tens of thousands bought the record, and Front Hall Records was off and running.

""The Hammered Dulcimer"" was a revelation for me - I'd never heard anything like it before.  The original line-up was Bill on hammered dulcimer, Tom McCreesh on fiddle, Jon Pederson on banjo, and Joan Pelton (who would go on to found Alcazar Records) on piano.
<a href=""http://s40.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=1QGUI65HJTBLF31MS0MN192EJP"">Gaspe Reel, Fiddlehead Reel</a>
<a href=""http://s40.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=3I3L4IUD5EPP20QBMC3HWUU3LL"">Smash the Windows, Coleraine, Haste to the Wedding</a>

Fennig's second album, ""Saturday Night in the Provinces"" (1975) found the band in its second incarnation with Bill on hammered dulcimer and Tom on fiddle, but no banjo and Toby Fink (later Toby Stover) on piano.  A much more musically interesting album than their first, their music was played more forcefully and was recorded better as well.  Alas, one of my favorite medleys was left off the CD so I include it here as a bonus track ripped from my well-loved LP, the final medley of this group.

With ""The Hammered Dulcimer Strikes Again"" (1977) the band had settled on their permanent line-up: Bill and Toby on hammered duclimer and piano respectively, and George Wilson on fiddle and banjo.  I can't say I really care for George Wilson's fiddling, he's kind of sloppy compared to Tom McCreesh.
<a href=""http://s40.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=12A5LUEZ3LVP231GLHMN9TTYX6"">The Three Sea Captains, Old Man Dillon, Johnny the Blacksmith</a>

""Fennigmania"" (1981) opens with something of an improvisation on a tune by Walt Michael called ""McKim's Reel,"" which they called ""Fennigmania"" and used as their title tune.  One of the best tunes they ever recorded, George's banjo work is very tasteful.

<a href=""http://s40.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=3M475TTMQ8QF416UA1A139FX47"">The Hogmanay, Mrs. Grace Bowie</a> (percussion by George)

""The Hammered Dulcimer Returns"" (1993, recorded in '90) was their first album in a dozen years and is the last album they've recorded.  The music seems a little uninspired, the engineering quality is not up to their earlier standards, and I'm still not a fan of George Wilson's fiddling but the album is both enjoyable and danceable.  Bouchard's Reel was written by Mike Springer, St. Timothy's March by Judy Morningstar.  George's understated banjo is particularly lovely on Planxty McGuire, a harp tune written by the blind Irish harper Turlough O'Carolan (1670-1738).

How is it that almost 4 years after 9/11/01, in an area that is a known terrorist target due to its ports and petroleum refineries, we were so poorly prepared for a major disaster?  How many more lives would have been lost if this had been a terrorist attack with no advance warning?  After all, we had more than 24 hours advance notice of Katrina's approach.  What if this had been a terrorist attack on the levees?  Or on any of the industries that might have released a large toxic cloud?  Why were no provisions made for evacuation of people who were not independently mobile, and of hospitals and nursing homes?  Why is it taking so long to get law enforcement into New Orleans?  It's a well-know fact that during civil emergencies the first thing to break down is civil order, so it's critical to inject a large security force to police any area as soon as the most immediate disaster is past to prevent looting and lawlessness.  Or did we learn absolutely nothing from the immediate aftermath of the war in Iraq?  People are the same everywhere, and if they think they can get something for nothing they'll try to get it.

We all need to demand better of our elected officials.  This disaster could not have been prevented, but it certainly could and should have been mitigated by better planning, and many hundreds or thousands of lives saved.  How good is the disaster plan for <i>your</i> community?

I am thoroughly disgusted with my government, on both sides of the aisle.  They've proven that they're more interested in political posturing and pork than in the good of my country."

<lj-cut text=""Cut for spoilers"">The relationship was both believable and enjoyable to read, but some of the characterizations and a great deal of the plot were not.  Both Holmes and Watson were written as not smart enough, in my opinion.  Watson in the original stories is a man of at least ordinary intelligence, great loyalty, and no small amount of physical courage.  The Xander of the Holmesverse, as it were.  To write him as a bumbling fool does the original stories and character a disservice.  And while Mary may at times equal Holmes, to write her as surpassing him about something as obvious as the typewritten message or the fact that Watson would be in danger just didn't work for me.  Holmes is hardly entering his dotage, he's a man in his 50s.  The basic plot of Donleavy doing that much better than Holmes for so long and then conveniently succumbing to madness/distraction, and Mary being apparently the only one to take action to get the gun - I'm sorry, that was just sloppy writing, and too close to Mary-Sueing Russell.  Still a very enjoyable read, but as others have said, much more for the relationship than the plot.</lj-cut>

"event","Wow, busy summer, I haven't had much time to watch Buffy.

<lj-cut text=""What's My Line, Parts 1 & 2"">These two episodes were very uneven.

<b>Part 1</b>
The first episode is marred by an inconsistent characterization of Giles as he reverts back to his earlier clueless stammering self in a way that seems totally inappropriate after ""The Dark Age,"" too much bad-accent Drusilla, a laughable lisp from DB when he's got the fangs on, and bad-accent Kendra who also can't act (although I'd quite forgotten how beautiful she is).  To say nothing of the looks-much-too-weak-to-hold-him door when Angel's trapped.  I know they focus on the lock in the commentary but it's the flimsy door that does in the scene.  Love Giles response to Buffy when she jokes in a rather black manner about her death and Giles tells her he doesn't think it's funny.  Love the first time Oz meets Willow.  Love Buffy's ""Note to self: religion: freaky.""  

And here's Xander teasing Buffy about going for snacks!

Buffy:  Speaking of, I really have to bail, but I promise I'll be back bright and early tomorrow and ready to slay.

Giles:  This is a matter of some urgency, Buffy.

Buffy:  I realize that. Well, you have to admit, I kinda lack in the book area. I mean, you guys are the brains, I'd only be here for moral support anyway.

Xander:  That's untrue, Buffy, you totally contribute. You go for snacks!

Oh, Xander - what did they do to you after this season?!

Interesting to see Giles snap at Xander.  Again the Giles-Xander dynamic surprises me: Xander is comfortable enough with Giles to keep the bad jokes coming, take getting slapped down, and snark at Giles a short time later.

Hate the plot-hole they create of the Order coming after Buffy forever, which they then just drop.

""Don't warn the tadpoles!"" Hee!

<b>Part 2</b>
OK, what the hell is it with The Council not keeping anyone informed?  I know Joss has a reputation for hating authority but this is just too idiotic.  The Council is not an organization that's <i>supposed</i> to keep the monsters at bay and the world safe from the Apocalypse.  This is an organization that has <i>succeeded</i> in keeping the world safe for we don't know how many centuries.  To write them as this disorganized and inefficient makes no sense at all.  They got a new slayer and didn't try to find out what happened to Buffy and Giles?  They didn't even try to retrieve Giles' watcher diaries?  This is the kind of writing that drives me nuts, this and the ""they'll come after you forever"" Order of Taraka riff which they neither follow up on nor explain.

I feel like I should say something about Xander/Cordy, but in fact I have nothing to say.

Kendra's accent?  Drives. Me. Nuts!

Also, why didn't anyone show SMG the proper way to sharpen a knife.  She's never sharpened a knife in her kitchen?!  Or whittled with one?  That scene has so much visual lameness that even ""Kendra killed the bad lamp!"" can't save it!

And Buffy not going back to report to Giles is another huge plot-hole - does Kendra go back and make the report that brings in the reinforcements?  Apparently so.  I find it curious that there are so many plot-holes in this episode (and we won't talk about all of season 7) after reading this <a href=""http://www.infocusmag.com/05augustseptember/whedonuncut.htm"">long, recent interview with Joss</a> when he talks about plot holes in the movies he was called in to script-doctor.

I admit I never particularly liked these two episodes, and my opinion has been reinforced after another viewing.</lj-cut>"

She writes both silly and serious songs, I find her silly songs far more entertaining.  Here are three of them.
<i>(In this song, I attempt to take back everything I said while standing in a phone booth on the corner of 49th and 3rd.)
I didn't mean it when I said I hope the cable in the elevator snaps when you step on board,
And I was joking when I said I hope you crack your head,
And get mangled by the downstairs revolving door,
And I was kidding when I said I hope the number 103 bus
Hits and makes a pancake out of you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
Isn't it amazing what a woman in love will do?</i>

<i>I am at the opera, I don't like the opera
But he loves the opera, and I love him
I follow the libretto, I follow the conductor,
When I follow the plot my head begins to spin.
I don't understand a word, even when it's English,
Everyone around me says, ooh, this is divine!
I don't like the opera, but look I'm at the opera,

I want cold pizza for breakfast, in a pinch cold spaghetti will do,
But there's nothin' in the world that I like better than eatin' cold pizza with you.</i>

<i>Fell asleep last night with the TV on.  Oh, what a dream I had.
I dreamed I answered every single one of those late night mail order ads.
And four to six weeks later, much to my surprise,
The mailman came to my front door, and I couldn't believe my eyes
When he brought the Vegematic, and the Pocket Fisherman too,
Illuminated illustrated history of life,
And Boxcar Willie with a Ginzu knife,
A bamboo steamer, and a Garden Weasel too,
And a tie-dyed, dayglow souvenir shirt from Six Flags Over Burbank.</i>

<a href=""http://www.judysmall.net/"">Judy Small</a> writes mostly political songs, and also sings the traditional songs of her native Australia.  Here's a song both humorous and political Judy wrote after learning that a new MacDonalds opens somewhere in the world every 17 hours.

<i>In the squalor of her awful little shack she sat
With her grungy cat and her parakeet,
And with rats runnin' round the size of caribou
Playing peekaboo with her filthy feet,
Eating donuts with a spoon and drinking Ovaltine
Through a scum of green floating leisurely,
In a coffee cup of plastic from the Sally Ann
Shaking in her hand out of misery,
And it's all because she didn't eat her vegetables,
It's all because she didn't eat her vegetables,
It's all because she didn't eat her vegetables as a kid,

Could you grab the pot of water on the stove so I can stick it
In the freezer, this is so archaic don't you think?

"event","Yesterday I said I didn't know where I was heading in my ""analysis,"" if you can call it that, of ""The Dark Age.""  Today I think I need to see if I can reconcile Giles and ""Ripper,"" and distill from ""Halloween"" and ""The Dark Age"" just who Rupert Giles <i>really</i> is.

<lj-cut text=""Read more."">Like many, I find the split-personality fanfics utter rubbish.  Let's stick with canon to investigate Giles' days in London.  We have three eye-witnesses to the events, Giles, Ethan, and Eyghon (in Jenny), and all three should probably be considered unreliable narrators.

<i>Ethan:  What? No hug? Aren't you pleased to see your old mate, Rupert?

Giles:  I'm just surprised I didn't guess it was you. This Halloween stunt stinks of Ethan Rayne.

Ethan:  Yes, it does, doesn't it? Don't wish to blow my own trumpet, but it's genius. The very embodiment of 'be careful what you wish for'.

Giles:  It's sick, brutal, and it harms the innocent.

Ethan:  Oh, and we all know that you are the champion of innocents and all things pure and good, Rupert. It's quite a little act you've got going here, old man.

Giles:  It's no act. It's who I am.

Ethan:  Who you are? The Watcher, sniveling tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer and her kin? I think not. I know who you are, Rupert, and I know what you're capable of.  But they don't, do they? They have no idea where you come from.</i>

Clearly Ethan knew what Giles was rebelling against during his Ripper days, did he know at the time or find out later?  Did he find out only after Randall's death, when Giles left Ethan and returned to the Council and his destiny?  When Ethan says, ""I know what you're capable of,"" is he referring just to Eyghon or to other events from those days?  Ethan seems to believe that the ""real"" Giles is like Ethan, and his current life is an act.  Eyghon (in Jenny) appears to state the opposite.

<i>Jenny: God, you just don't change, do you?

Giles:  What?

Jenny:  It's not right, it wouldn't be proper, people might get hurt. You're like a woman, Ripper. You cry at every funeral. You never had the strength for me. You don't deserve me.  But guess what? You've got me. Under your skin.</i>

Does Eyghon know the ""real"" Giles best?  Giles presumably ""hosted"" the demon in his body/mind, after all.  Is Eyghon's assessment accurate?  And what does Giles himself say about those days?

<i>Buffy:  Talk to me! Giles, you're scaring me.

Giles:  I'm sorry.

Buffy:  Don't be sorry, be Giles. C'mon, we fight monsters. This is what we do. They show up, they scare us, I beat 'em up and they go away. This isn't any different!

Giles:  It <i>is</i> different.

Buffy:  Because you don't know how to stop it?

Giles:  Because I created it!</i>

And later:
<i>Giles:  I was twenty-one, studying history at Oxford. And, of course, the occult by night. I hated it. The tedious grind of study, the overwhelming pressure of my destiny. I dropped out, I went to London.  I fell in with the worst crowd that would have me. We practiced magicks. Small stuff for pleasure or gain. And Ethan and I discovered something... bigger.

Buffy:  Eyghon.

Giles:  Yes. One of us would go into a deep sleep, and the others would summon him. It was an extraordinary high!  God, we were fools.

Buffy:  You couldn't control it.

Giles:  One of us, Randall, he lost control. Eyghon took him whole. We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall, but it killed him. No. We killed him. We thought we were free of the demon after that. But now he's back. And one by one, he will kill us all.</i>

****************

Here's my interpretation of those three accounts, and my armchair psychoanalysis of Giles.

When Giles says ""Because I created it!"" we find out exactly who Giles is.  He's the apple that fell close to the ""responsibility and sacrifice"" tree.  He's a man who must take responsibility for <i>everything</i>.  ""I created it,"" he says.   ""I,"" not ""we,"" even though he says just moments later that both he and Ethan discovered it, and there's certainly no indication that anyone in their little group was forced into participating.  But Giles had been trained from the age of 10 to be a Watcher, to fight for the world, to be one of ""the good guys.""  Survivor's guilt is the key to understanding the adult Giles.

<i>Giles:  I was ten years old when my father told me I was destined to be a Watcher.  He was one, and his mother before him, and I was to be next.

Buffy:  Were you thrilled beyond all measure?

Giles:  No, I had very definite plans about my future. I was going to be a fighter pilot. Or possibly a grocer. My father gave me a very tiresome speech about responsibility and sacrifice.</i>

It's not unreasonable to believe that Giles was informed of his destiny at the age of 10 so he could begin his training as a Watcher at that tender age, and that to a large extent he was robbed of his childhood.  By the time of his rebellion at 21 he'd been training for more than half his life.  We don't know much about what Watcher training required beyond a grounding in scholarship, languages, research, the occult, and martial arts.  I think we can assume that Giles wasn't given a Potential, we don't know at what age such assignments were usually made, and we don't know what would have become of his life as a Watcher had he not been assigned to Buffy.

What was the ""overwhelming pressure"" of his destiny?  Was it the knowledge that he <i>would</i> be assigned a potential, that he would be forced to raise her as Kendra was raised, and that the culmination of a lifetime of training might be to lead an innocent girl to her death?  Eyghon (in Jenny) says, ""You cry at every funeral.""  Is she referring to funerals of Slayers?

I posit that whatever the Council might have known about London they never knew about Eyghon, or Randall's death, and I base this on the fact that Quentin never brought it up in any of the scenes he had with Giles.  Given the kind of dirty power politics Quentin engaged in, especially in ""Checkpoint,"" that incident would have been too useful a tool for Quentin to ignore.  There was no body to dispose of, or for the authorities to find later, because Randall probably turned into a puddle of goo.  Those involved had no reason to report his death and every reason <i>not</i> to.  Presuming they were all over the age of majority, it could have been quite some time before Randall's family realized he was missing, assuming they cared.  I'll guess further that one very good reason for the group members to flee from one another and never contact each other again was because Randall had not yet been missed, and the more distance they could put between each other, the better able they'd be to prevent his disappearance being tracked back to any of them.

So Giles was never held to account for Randall's death by any outside agency, but the obvious guilt he still feels over two decades later makes it clear that he never recovered from Randall's death, nor forgave himself his part in it.  No one else could punish him because no one knew, so he punished himself by rededicating himself to his destiny.  My best guess is that he tried to make his life as a Watcher penance for his part in the events that led to Randall's death.

In order to better understand Giles we also need to look at Ethan Rayne.  Robin Sachs does such a masterful job with the character that he succeeds in making him somewhat sympathetic against our better judgment, but looking solely at his actions I believe it's safe to say that Ethan is a charismatic sociopath of the type dangerous cults form around, and that he is a man totally without a conscience.  Maybe this was what attracted Giles to him in the first place, believing that the only way to rid himself of his destiny of ""responsibility and sacrifice"" was to shed his conscience and be like Ethan.  Giles said, ""I fell in with the worst crowd that would have me,"" which would indicate that he shopped around before settling on this group.  He wanted to leave his straight-laced past behind, and he adopted a persona that was as different as he could make it from the Watcher he'd been trained to be.  Perhaps he emulated Ethan's behavior so successfully that he convinced Ethan he was a sociopathic twin, and Ethan never accepted that Giles was anything else.  Or maybe Ethan simply enjoyed tormenting Giles by forcing him to consider the possibility that Ripper wasn't as much of an act as Giles would like, now, to believe.

Why did Ethan show up in Sunnydale?  Was it the Hellmouth?  Giles' presence there?  Both?  As I already said, while I believe there was probably a sexual component to their relationship I don't believe they were lovers in the conventional sense, or that Ethan is a rejected lover.  Ethan is a sophisticated older version of the boy who pulls wings off flies: he torments Giles for his own entertainment, because he knows how to push Giles' buttons.  He does it because he <i>can</i>.  I don't believe there's any more depth to it than that.

We see a cold and deadly rage when Giles' confronts Ethan in ""Halloween,"" and a determination to cause hurt that seems foreign to what we know of Giles up to that point.  It's not inconsistent with what we know of Ethan to assume he was relatively unaffected by Randall's death, and perhaps wanted to go on with the London group as before, probably to the horror of the other participants.  We can also assume that Giles' reaction was exactly the opposite, he was deeply affected and perhaps saw Ethan for what he really was only after Randall's death.  Perhaps he resents this characteristic of Ethan's psyche - that he <i>can</i> remain emotionally unaffected when Giles is unable to control such reactions in himself.  In any case, I can certainly see Giles wanting to cause Ethan physical pain since he knows Ethan is incapable of emotional pain, and never paid any real price for his part in Randall's death.

Giles, it seems, paid an enormous emotional price for Eyghon, and never recovered from it.  He ran from his destiny and into a life that was as far from being a Watcher as he could make it.  But when his actions contributed to the death of a (relative) innocent, perhaps even a friend, he left Ethan and that life behind.  And if Randall <i>was</i> a friend, his death may have resulted in an ""it should have been me"" response by Giles that made him careless with his own life, and perhaps gave him something of a death-wish.  I think it's safe to say that Randall's death was the worst thing that had ever happened to him pre-Sunnydale, and therefore it's not surprising that Eyghon's re-emergence completely paralyzes him.

So my conclusion is that with Giles, what we see is what we get.  He's a man who as a young adult tried to flee his destiny, an attempt that failed spectacularly.  He's a deeply emotional man who never lost his moral center no matter how hard he tried to leave it behind.  There are hidden depths, especially regarding the affection he finds it so difficult to express, but there is no hidden ""Ripper."" That was a persona he tried on briefly, to his everlasting regret, and discarded.</lj-cut>"

"event","Instead of pointing out the highlights of ""The Dark Age,"" and its many plot-holes, I think I'd like to discuss what this episode illustrates about the evolving Buffy-Giles dynamic.  Feel free to join in.

<lj-cut text=""The Dark Age"">Giles up to this point has been almost a caricature of an absent-minded professor: intelligent but largely clueless, socially inept with the only other adult in his social circle, no social contacts at all outside of the few people who are aware that Buffy is the Slayer.  In this group's hierarchy Giles has the least power.  He has no power over Buffy beyond what she allows him, as the show has amply demonstrated.  He has no power over Xander and Willow beyond what they allow as he is neither their parent nor their teacher.  Jenny, as their teacher, has much more power over the Scoobies as she shows by forcing them to attend school on a Saturday.  Willow and Xander hold more sway over Buffy than Giles does simply by virtue of being her best friends and age-mates - they're the ones who know the truth in ""Reptile Boy"" when she lies to Giles about going to the frat party, for example.  Giles has trouble carrying on a conversation with Jenny, or at least one that doesn't involve the next apocalypse, much less asking her out on a date.  She's the one who invites <i>him</i> to dinner and a football game in ""Some Assembly Required.""  And once again in this episode Jenny is the prime mover as she informs him she wants to ""stay in"" and presumably seduce him on their next date.

Giles is essentially powerless.

In the past few episodes we've seen Buffy give Giles permission to go out on dates and Buffy beating on Giles until he lets <i>her</i> go out, Buffy totally in charge of slaying, Giles asking Buffy to let him help her fight (""School Hard"") and being turned down.

The other evolving dynamic is the growing importance of their friendship, with Giles offering emotional support when Buffy needs it, although he's rather inept at this, too, in ""When She Was Bad;"" forgiving her transgressions in ""Reptile Boy;"" and accompanying her to Ford's grave in ""Lie to Me.""

When Buffy goes to Jenny for help and describes Giles' behavior as being very ""anti-Giles,"" in fact that's not the case.  Yes he is certainly having trouble maintaining the tweed-clad Brit act, but what we see here is Giles continuing down the road of powerlessness he's been on since he first met Buffy and she refused to surrender her independence.

Giles' reaction to learning of his friends' deaths and the re-emergence of Eyghon is hardly mature.  He drinks, apparently until he passes out at his desk, and avoids dealing with the problem.  We don't see him engaging in any research, indeed the books he would need are at the high school and the children use them later.  He doesn't warn Jenny or the children that he's a danger to them, as Ethan points out, until Eyghon has already become a threat.  The only time he tries to take control of the situation is when he orders Buffy to stay out of it, which would cut off his one avenue of assistance if she actually listened to him.  And when he realizes Jenny has been possessed, he falls apart completely.

Buffy, as ever, takes control of the situation.  She gets the Scoobies working to find a solution and then goes off to help Giles.  The scenes with Buffy and Giles at his  condo as she first tries to get him to ""be Giles,"" and then becomes his confessor, are amazing, and not only because they're so superbly acted.  Giles, while drinking, confesses his youthful rebellion to Buffy in a complete role-reversal of Buffy's ""I had one drink, I told one lie.""

It's unclear just what Giles' part was in killing Randall, if there was any beyond actually summoning the demon.  ""We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall, but it killed him. No. We killed him.""  It's not made explicit that they themselves somehow killed Randall, in fact it sounds like the opposite.  Also left out of Giles' account is his ""return to the fold.""  We don't know if the Council ever learned of his activities in London, and if they did what price was exacted or what rehabilitation demanded of him before he returned to the bosom of the Council.  

And we learn in the library scene that Giles' sexual history very likely included orgies in a group that was overwhelmingly male.  I read an interesting comment about this somewhere along the line, perhaps by an LJer, that Giles was comfortable with sex but uncomfortable with intimacy.  I find that a viable take on the subject as it helps explain his near-paralysis around Jenny.  I don't know that it helps explain his relationship with Ethan, or that I buy the ""spurned lover"" role often assigned to Ethan.  I do believe that sex was a component of their relationship.

All of which has provided a rich vein of speculation for fanficcers to mine.

By the time Giles has finished his confession, apparently fortified by a significant quantity of alcohol, he's too unsteady to accompany Buffy as she goes off to clean up his mess.  When he sees in some kind of vision that Ethan has tattooed Buffy, his solution to the problem is a suicide attempt.  I assume he believes this will save Jenny's life, his reasoning will be considerably less sound in ""Passion.""  And when Angel interrupts Giles' self-sacrifice, Giles once again surrenders control, this time to Willow on her unsupported demand to trust her because ""this will work.""

The transformation of Buffy into Giles is complete when she offers her emotional support after Giles' failed attempt to reconcile with Jenny, and then distracts him by dragging him off to train with her.

What does it say about Giles that he's so incapable of expressing affection, and so willing to sacrifice everything up to and including his life, as we saw once before in ""Prophesy Girl?""  What does it say about him that attempting to trade his life for Jenny's, as he earlier tried to do for Buffy, is the <i>only</i> action he takes?

I don't think I'm heading anywhere with this.  It's just that I'm constantly surprised by Giles' behavior, and by the nature of the Buffy-Giles dynamic, as I watch the early seasons again for the first time in a couple of years.</lj-cut>"

"event","""Reptile Boy,"" ""Halloween,"" ""Lie to Me,"" and ""The Dark Age"" - four episodes in a row where humans are the source of trouble.  Never noticed that before.  Something I did notice many times: SMG's stunt double looks nothing like her and is much too easily recognizable as just that - not Buffy.

Lie to Me:
In many ways just an OK episode for me.  But an OK episode of Buffy is still pretty good!  Angel and Willow in her bedroom, Willow not-lying to Buffy at school the next day, and later, ""Ours is a forbidden love.""  Hee!  Once again Buffy gives Giles permission to go out on a date.  Monster trucks!  And of course the discussion between Giles and Buffy at the end over Ford's grave.

I'm once again reminded of the LJer who commented that Joss isn't very good at creating worlds.  A show bible that outlined the importance of vampire ""families,"" and some explanation of these relationships to the audience, would have gone a long way in justifying Angel allowing Drusilla to live.  After all, the woman he once tormented is long dead and a demon inhabits her corpse.  It's not as if he can do anything for the woman he killed, but by killing the demon he could protect the residents of Sunnydale.  What more proof that she was dangerous did he need than her confrontation with the little boy at the playground?  The inability of the writers to explain these kinds of things bothered me throughout the series, especially when it was the Scoobies letting vampires like Harmony live."

"event","Here are a three for folkies and two for Buffy fans.

<lj-cut text=""Five songs under the cut."">In 1934, 34 years after the catastrophic <a href=""http://earlytexashistory.com/Pomerosa%20Press/galvlinks.html"">1900 Galveston flood</a>, John Lomax recorded a song sung by Sin-Killer Griffin and his congregation at a prison in Texas.  The song is believed to have been written by a black balladeer, possibly an eye-witness, who put it to a hymn tune.  When that field recording was released on the Library of Congress LP <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/shop/index.php?action=cCatalog.showItem&cid=13&scid=70&iid=866"">Negro Religious Songs and Services</a>, it was picked up by a number of contemporary folk musicians, including Tom Rush.

Here are two versions of the song, appropriate on this day when Dennis has made landfall on the Gulf Coast.  In case you don't know, the Galveston flood was caused by a hurricane storm surge that more or less submerged the island.  The first song is the original fragment, as it was released on that Library of Congress LP.  I assume the original recording was damaged in some way because they fade in and out of the song so we hear only the middle.  The second is a different version recorded by Joe Hickerson, former head of the Archive of Folk Song at the Library of Congress.  He didn't learn it from that LOC lp, but from a friend.  He plays guitar and sings lead, and is accompanied on guitar by Ed Trickett and Michael Cooney, and a host of people join him on the chorus.  From the album ""<a href=""http://www.folk-legacy.com/store/Scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=75"">Five Days Singing, Volume 2</a>"" on <a href=""www.folklegacy.com/"">Folk Legacy Records</a>.

In a similar vein, a Dougie MacLean song sung by the New England trio <a href=""http://www.overallmusic.com/geninfo.html"">Cindy Kallet, Ellen Epstein and Michael Cicone</a>, from their album ""<a href=""http://www.overallmusic.com/songlists/angels.html"">Angels in Daring</a>"".

And on a completely different note, from the show that introduced the concept of ""the plural of apocalypse,"" here's the cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in two songs from the musical episode ""Once More, With Feeling.""  The first is sung by Hinton Battle as the demon Sweet, the second by the Buffy cast.

"event","Halloween
This is a very uneven episode, mostly because SMG doesn't come anywhere close to pulling off a helpless southern belle act.  It's the first time we see her do a bad job as an actor.  This is also the first time I noticed just how short Armin Shimerman is - in the scene where he drafts Buffy into volunteering and they're standing together it doesn't look like there's an inch of difference between them, although looking up this trivia online I found he's 5' 6"".  The best parts: Buffy and Willow sneaking the Watcher diary out of Giles' office, Xander teaching his kids how to get more candy, Ghost!Willow startling Giles in the Library, and of course Giles' confrontation with Ethan.  The next time you watch it, listen to how effectively ASH uses his voice in the scene where they meet in Ethan's costume shop.  It's a technique he uses with some regularity - lowering the volume and often also raising the pitch of his voice during scenes of great emotional stress.

Ethan Rayne.  What a rich character, and how much fanfic has invested in him for someone who appeared so infrequently in the series.  Robin Sachs is simply marvelous in the role.  We see for the first time just how ruthless Giles can be.  While parts of this scene amount to a red herring because the audience is being set up to wonder just how bad Giles <i>really</i> was, ASH finally gets a chance to stretch his acting wings.  He has, as I don't need to tell anyone reading this, a very mobile and expressive face and we see a lot there we've never seen before.  No bumbling, stammering, clueless librarian in this scene!

It's a major gyp that we never get to see Cordelia's reaction to finding out that, yes, Angel really <i>is</i> a vampire.  And I've always wondered if Ethan's ""Be seeing you"" was a shout-out to the 1960s cult TV show ""The Prisoner."""

"event","<lj-cut text=""Two decent MOTW episodes under the cut!"">Inca Mummy Girl
Except for the teaser this was just one great scene after another.  I don't remember liking it this well before, but now that I've seen it again I just don't get the hate often directed at this episode.  The scene where Buffy beats on Giles until he lets her go to the dance is just too funny for words.  ""Oh! I know this one! Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah, blah, bity blah, I'm so stuffy, gimme a scone.""  ""It's as if you know me.""  Willow's heart being broken when she overhears Xander and Buffy talking in the library, Xander acting like a complete idiot around Ampata, the introduction of Oz, the Twinkie scene, Smart!Buffy getting praised by Giles for her research, the scene in Buffy's bedroom where the parallel between Ampata and Buffy is made explicit, Xander defending Willow against the MOTW yet again, Buffy acknowledging Xander bringing her back to life.  A very strong episode, especially considering how unpopular it seems to be.

Reptile Boy
I have always had a soft spot for this episode in spite of the ""after-school special"" message and its other obvious short-comings, including a cheesy demon and ""When you kiss me I wanna die.""  I just never got that line.  But the good parts are numerous.  The beginning of the teaser where the kids are watching the Balliwood movie and playing with Willow's hair.  Buffy pouting at Giles in the library and Giles insisting it's not getting to him.  Buffy's headdesk.  Buffy lying to Giles, and Willow covering for her during the scene with Giles in the library.  And, of course, the Willow smack-down of both Giles and Angel.  Giles' expression is marvelous!  Their assault on the frat house where we finally get to see Giles fight well, taking out a frat boy with one backhand blow.  Giles acknowledging he's been too hard on Buffy, and the casual hand under her elbow as they leave the basement.  Awwww!

**************

In addition to this review of the earlier seasons changing (correcting, really) my view of the relationship between Buffy and Giles, and Buffy's role as the captain of the ship from day one, I'm also finding I like Xander a lot more and Willow rather less this time around.  I don't <i>dislike</i> Willow, it's more that she doesn't, I don't know, get to be heroic much.  In Reptile Boy she has some of her best and most memorable scenes, taking on Giles and Angel in the library, and keeping everyone on track during the frat house fight.  But I'm more aware this time 'round of the fact that they tended to use her character almost as a prop to hang heartbreak and physical/emotional vulnerability on.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Some Assembly Required and School Hard under the cut"">Some Assembly Required:
Another episode that was much better than I'd remembered.  So many good scenes!  Giles practicing pickup lines on the chair, and the children walking in on him and teasing him about it.  Giles patting Cordelia on the shoulder and saying ""There, there"" as she prattles on about her ""pain.""  ""Love makes you do the wacky.""  Giles completely tongue-tied until Jenny turns the tables and invites herself to the game and to dinner with him.  Buffy and Giles swapping personalities as Giles tries to get out of watchering to go on his date with Jenny, and Take!Charge!Buffy gives him permission.  Willow and Xander horning in on their date - so cute!  Smart!Xander riding the gurney out of the fire when he can't untie Cordelia.  Still don't like the 241-year-old lusting after a 16-year old.  But aside from that, another standout episode in my book.

School Hard:
Stand by for some serious ranting.
I'm a musician.  One of the first things that got my attention when I stumbled on this show in reruns was the marvelous use of language.  This show appealed first to my <i>ears</i>.  It relies very heavily on well-written dialog, I guess to the point where Joss felt he had to prove, with ""Hush,"" that he could do more than just write snappy lines.  And Joss displayed no small competence as a musician/composer with the score for ""Once More, With Feeling.""  So where the fuck were his ears when he hired Juliet Landau?!  For me she's one of the worst things ever to happen to this show in the early seasons because every time she opens her mouth, she screams, ""I'm an actor playing a role!""  Every time she says ""Spoik"" in that phony Cockney accent I want to hurl something at the screen.  Or just hurl.  And I don't think she's much of an actor, either.  And if any of you ever find yourselves in the position of casting director, here's a hint: it is much less distracting for an actor to have the <i>wrong</i> accent than it is for him/her to have a <i>bad</i> accent, and also much less damaging to your final product.

Spike's entrance is a classic, although his accent takes a while to settle down and he definitely has trouble talking around his fangs.  Also classic: ""Slayer!""  ""Slayee!""  And, of course, ""You get the hell away from my daughter!""  This episode doesn't hit its stride until we get to Parent-Teacher Night and the pace picks up considerably.  The scene with Giles asking Buffy, ""Let me help you,"" and Buffy asking him instead to make sure her mother gets out safely, again defines their relationship as nothing close to equal.  This is the first episode that was worse than I remembered, probably because I actually <i>watched</i> the Spike and Drusilla scenes instead of fast-forwarding through them.  A mistake I won't make again.  Not a favorite episode.</lj-cut>"

"event","For those of you who do not follow Auburn Football, this week was their homecoming game. My best friend and I got some great tickets for the game and spent saturday and sunday up there celebrating it with our auburn friends. It was great. Just last year we used to complain that Auburn was bad luck and that we never wanted to go hang in Auburn again. We had some bad times (hitting a deer, the person we went to see left town knowing we were 5 mins away, two tickets (speeding and the other for crossing the yellow line for 5 secs)) but this time was good. I think the change in the main group of people we hangout with in auburn helped a lot. But i do feel bad about one thing. I unleased the plague ontomy male friends. This girl I use to like is moving from one of my friends to the next and then the next. It's really screwed up. But it also makes me wonder, whats the deal with me sometimes. I asked a friend to name some of my bad attributes, she could only think of three really, two of them I knew (always late, bad procrasinater) but the third one i think is way off. She says i'm cynical, as bad as my friends jason and brittany. I was surprised. But then i realized why she said it. I am honest to people and tell them whats the big picture as i see it. The girl i asked had a male friend who was basically a sex buddy. She says they were boyfriend/girlfriend. Question if you are having sex with a person for 5 months, and you have gone on 1 date at the end of the 5 months, are you an item with the person. I told her that it was not as  she saw it and so i guess that could be cynical. I see it as speaking the truth but whatever. Plus she thinks she's always right and I will tell you when you're wrong.  Anyway I'm still wondering about some of my real bad habits. I threw out the cynical one unless someone else says it again (so far no one else thinks i'm cynical) 
Back to auburn. The game was good, the party afterwards was good. FYI being the designated driver is alright but having to deal with your friend who just learned about alchol is not. My few beers did not lower the annoyance of some of my drunk friends, but he got better as the party went along. Also drunk people and fireworks do not mix. Remeber this if you take only one thing away from this post."

"event","Well, Today we had a store meeting at 9:00. I was informed i could miss it due to having a class, but I said I could miss my class and attend the meeting. Dumb move. The meeting was fucked up from the start when the district manager says I wish we could have meet on better terms. He fired the whole store. After all the shit and company policy we had to deal with. The fact that we could only work one staff person at a time in a mall where shop lifting happens every second, no not every minute but every freaking second. He says it wasn't for our bad inventory which ironially the stuff ended up missing right after he decided to move our manager, not seeing our manager had anything to do with it but he left the store with an assitant manager and 2 sales associates throughout most of the month of october and september. He claims our peformance was bad, but our perfomance is based of off the poor inventory, the shrinkage is the missing itmes as a percent of sales from that store so if the shrinkage is high, guess what our peformance will seem low. And it wasn't like we were missing a lot of stuff, just someone somehow grabbed 10 game boy sps which equates to a thousand and some dollars missing. So basically I am no longer working for the store even though the managers thought I was a great worker. I was the only person in the store to sell a freaking n-gage, I had one of the highest percentile on the esa conversions. I deserved to keep my job. They shoulda put us on probation or warning or something. Geeze. I'm sorry, if you can't tell the only time i fail something is when  i'm being extremely lazy and getting fired is like failing. This is a first for me. Heck even when i go after a girl, usally I don't really try which cause me to lose an oppurunity but this job, I worked hard for. I spent 5 years applying, I came in and worked extra hours, helped with manager duties, Sacrificed going to tuscolossa for football games. I am a BIG UA fan, this was a major sacrifice. For what, a sorry but company policy says i gotta so good bye. Anyway I''m through ranting. 

Hope yalls day is better than mine. On the good news, before i learned i will not be having a job by the end of this day, I won some auburn homecoming tickets off of ebay for 30 dollars and paid for them. So I get to see my first auburn game. Hopefully it will be a good one even though auburn should easily win. Let me know if there's anything going on in auburn afterwards."

"event","Well, I've finally returned from Hampton University's homecoming this past weekend. It was great. I love coming back to campus and hanging with my old friends and finding out what trouble i can get into. The pirates destroyed south carolina state. I have never seen Hampton play as well as they did during that game. I think they can win the MEAC this year, but time will only tell. They were playing at home with all of the alumni back cheering them on. So the homefield advantage coulda played a major role.

The trouble was too easy to find. The first night I got there I had my ex fix me some food. It was great. I forget what it was but I ate most of it, then i started wrestling with her, thank god her other ex came over before things got too far. Sometimes it's hard to stop when u don't want to do something. Anyway I took that opportunity to disappear and go off to hang with my peoples.  The next night i met this girl that ranks a 9 on the 10 pt scale. She was from the islands and attended one of the colleges up in northern Va. She was friends with my old roommate and came down with two of her friends. We were hitting it off pretty good,heck when the party moved to my hotel room, she was the one who volunteered the idea of staying over with me. Problem was that her ride was my old roommates brother who wasn't as lucky that night, so he told her she had to leave cause she had no ride. I woulda given her one in the morning but i thought i was leaving on an airplane the next day.  So that went my second night.   
I guess i should be counting my lucky stars cause these past couple weekends i've been asked to stay over by a couple cute girls and i've had something or someone stop it for happening. Just so yall know, I'm trying towait till i get married, playing around and doing everything but i'm cool with, but so far i've not had sex. On these past occasions i've weakened a lot more on my resolve then I used to. I've barley escaped so many times but the next day I resolve to keep holding out. I've been through too many flings and stuff to cave in now. But who knows, When  i left high school a lot of my friends were virgins, now i'm the only one left almost. Don't ask me why just am, so who knows if I can last any longer. I wager I can do it. I might be a freak as somepeople put it, but I'm also very stubborn. :) 

Also I'm having a hard time dealing with my grandfather and his stroke. One of the main reasons i went up to hampton was to bring my grandfather down to live with my family. Once I arrived in Virginia i realized how bad the stroke really was. IT's hard to look at a man who taught you how to fish, how to throw a pot (make a pot from clay for those who don't know what that means), who taught me about guns and hunting, and informed me of the history of the hampton roads area and see a man that has to be retaught his basic motor skills. I can see it in his eyes, he still has that fountain of knowledge it seems, but now he can't communicate and relies on my mother and my family to help him. Hopefully his reabillitation will not last a long time, if anyone has any idea how long it usally takes to relearn speach and other basic functions please let me know. It's just hard to watch. I want to be there for him, but I cant. I don't want to dodge him but sometimes i really want to. It might be the fact I've never seen anyone in my family injured this badly. When my grandmothers and aunt were sick I didn't see them really, I didn't even see them get burried.  I saw the grave after they were burried and covered up. The elders I helped in the retirement homes and hospitals I used to work with were strangers who i were getting to know, they were not as close as my grandfather is to me. This is a process that will take time for me to get used to. It's kinda odd, here I am in my 20's starting to really enjoy live and here he is starting to end his. I hope it won't be for another 20 years or so, but the decline is starting. I'm always on the go, he's now restricted to a wheel chair at the moment. We are on two extreme opposite ends of the same pole. I hope i can deal with the situation beter."

"event","It's funny sometimes how you say you are going to do something and just keep putting it off and off and off, then the next thing you know it's been almost a month since you said you were going to do it. Well I've decided to stop procrastinating (i stink at spelling) and decided to just go on and do it. 

Okay Basically I have a sports rant and then a rant about whats going on with me and just ideas and things to toss out,

Well I'm sick of school, I like work though. I'm working three jobs at the moment but thats cool. One is a research job where my school has not gotten any of the chemicals we need in yet. The other has been a child hood dream, working for EB games. And the third is working for my father during cpu repair and monthly database scans. They are pretty good jobs. I don't know if this can happen or not, but i think i've become even lazier when it comes to school. I have less then 40 credits left, two semesters and i can't go and do the work. Whats the deal. I have a feeling thats going to be my slogan for today, whats the deal. Anyway I drove to school and found out dream land is coming to montgomery, yea. I can finally say i'm over the girl i liked all suummer. well most of the summer. I'm cool with still being friends, just wish i had a little more but now I'm over it. If yall got any advice on not  going straight to friend mode with people let me know. Heh actually this was my fault for waiting to decide how i feel about her or maybe it wasn't. Dontcha just love questioning your self. Besides that my life's been pretty good. Actually went to some clubs in my hometown. Just to make sure yall understand, when I left for college, I partied and went clubbing up there. I've been to a couple of clubs in Auburn, but the clubs at home never seem to be worth my effort. I finnaly cave in the last couple nights and hit some of them. They were fun and the beer was nice since they just passed the law allowing draft beer, but it wasn't like those Va beach clubs or the DC clubs. Makes me miss my home by the sea. But the weekend of UA's Homecoming had to be one of the best parties i've been to in awhile. It lasted all night, I drove up after work so i missed the game but going up for that one night was worth it still. Even though i had only two hours of sleep because i had to drive back and work the next/same day it was still worth it. My boss even got to beat me in football that sunday night because i hadn't eaten really and he had more sleep after the party then I did (  he feel sleep before me, and left way after me) But here me Thomas, next football game You're mine. I don't have much to say bout whats been going on in my world. Just figured i'd put something up. From here on out I hope to be doing more thoughts of the moment and just bouncing things off of people. Time for sports

Man My world in sports is falling apart. My teams keep slipping up. I give the falcons some credit for their poor start without Vick, but this is a team that should still win a couple games with a regular quaterback. Dan Reeves is not that bad a coach and the defense was killer last year. Why does it look like the whole NFL is trying to get their licks in while Vick is out.  Don't get me started on the Braves. The team with one of the best records of the season and they get beat by pirates in a cubs uniform. It's getting to be a tradition, cheer for the Braves during the season, but when post season starts, turn to football. 
In college football, I don't know what to say. I wanna Scream ROLL FREAKING TIDE,  heck i will scream ROLL FREAKING TIDE. Problem is the tide aint rolling as we speak. The tide is too beat up at the moment and things i thought I wouldn't see are happening. Blame it on whatever; coaches, lack of scholarships, lack of talent, bad luck, whatever, the tide just isn't the same one as last years. It makes me wonder how much the name that will not be spoken meant to last years season. But the good thing is Shaud is the man. He has my respect and admiration for all the things he's gone through during his football career and he still consdiered a very dangerous back in the SEC. Some say even more so then Cadillac and Arkansa's Cobb. I will also like to take this moment to state three things about SEC football. Billy, I must say, after such a poor start the Rebels have earned a little respect from me. A light bulb went off in Mississippi and I guess they decided to try having a running game to help ol Eli. But on that note I must say you beat a Florida team that no one knows what to think about. We never know which one is gonna play that week or which coach will controll things. Yall also beat an injured and bleading Tide team. The test is gonna be arkansa this weekend and the rest of the west. Second thing, The SEC is the best confrence from top to bottom. How many games have gone into overtime or been won/lose on last minute plays. Ever weekend is a great weekend to watch the SEC. Third, Jason this is to agree with what we said in the beginning of the year, or atleast part of it we agreed. Auburn will win once they develop and offensive line. Campbell is not the worse qb in the ncaa. He is still wet behind the ears and gets scared. When the line was not blocking for the runnigbacks, the pass defense was even worse. Know look at the team and you wonder what happened to the line. Did the farm boys in auburn develop a new type of gatorade that turns an awful line to one of the best in the country (as they are playing now, but counting the whole season they are way off) Did tuberville get scared for his life, Alabama at the time was winning, auburn was not. Tubberville has been there for the whole preseason and before. The tide dragged a guy in because of his daddy's name and the loyalty he brings with him (I'm not dishing shula, I do think Crooms was a better choice  by numbers and for the legacy of Bama Football but thats water under the bridge. I support my team and their coach. Just wish he will solve this motivation problem he seems to have before games, the tide has got to be the worse team in the whole league when you look at the first quater only.) He was the one to do great things while bama was suppose to be a speed bump in the confrence race. Who knows what happened but auburn has an o-line and with that the weapons can now be released. If cadillac survives the season and keeps improving, he should beat those qbs and wrs up for the heisman. He does it mostly on his own, the others are like a tag team. The skill of both the qb and the wr are used to make those great plays. Look at texas for example. Roy williams makes all of the texas qbs look good. 
Now the question is whats happening in the NHL, My ducks after such a great season last year have barley scored. The thrashers are doing pretty good job for them, but the sad loss of one of their own hurts.

"event","Hey, I've been thinking a lot for some reason recently, but before i start thinking just gonna talk bout whats been going on recently. Just came back from 6 flags over georgia. It was pretty good except for maybe 1 hour. It seemed like the rides were a lot faster since the last time i've been.
I think this six flags trip is what boosted my usual pensive mood, to a mood of ponderment I have concluded that life is only about adreneline. The whole point of our lifes is to push the excitment level and our limits till we reach this period of pure escatsy from the excitement. A rush of feelings and energy  builds and builds, then is released leaving an empty feeling around afterwards. When you fall in love, same thing. You get the adreneline up while you're with the significant other, then when they leave, the energy leaves with ya. Life is nothing but an addicition to adreneline. 
On a whole nother topic. Have you ever meet a girl thatcha tried to date. But everytime somethings about to happen, something else happens to  make the relationship harder to keep. Well there's a friend of mine that I've been kinda starting a relationship on and off for four years, every summer almost. There was and is something between us but know after all these summers, she is no longer single. This is  not a  big problem cause i've date other people too during the school year and stuff, and I understand that I should not think about starting a relationship with her, but that doesn't mean I can't. A lot of times since I met this angel, her name has flown in and out of my head at the  oddest times. Even know her name still keeps popping up, but the thing that annoys me is that it pops up when I'm thinking bout the word love, or relationships. This pisses me off. There's only been one person in my life that I would tie any of those words too, and she is not that person. But it's the fact that I'm still stuck on her thats frustrating me. I admit when I like someone I keep a torch burning for them for a long time, but that doesn't mean i still think about them, and this girl makes me think about her. If yall got any advice let me know. I think i need an exorcisim to get rid of my inner demons or something. 
Anyway Those are the thoughts flying though my head. Sorry if they don't make sense, I rarely do. Till next time i decide to stop and type, Later"

After a couple years of reading peoples live journal info, I've decided to try this out for my self. Don't have much to say at first. Still trying to get use to being at Auburn university. It's a good school, but I'm so far into my major, the teachers stop teaching with real numbers and practical situations. It's now all theory and open ended problems. It's okay though. I like thinking abstract, just don't like thinking abstract too much. 


I'm missing not having a sporting event to follow. Baseball happens so often, the idea of following a team is extremely hard. Plus i never have time to watch the Braves (my team.) By the way congrads braves on winning yesterday, haven't had time to check for today. I guess for my first time, This will have to do. I swear my journal will improve as time progresses."

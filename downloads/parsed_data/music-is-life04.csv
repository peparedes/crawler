"event","So after the party madness at Jackie's house - which was awesome by the way... I decided that I will have to make sure I pack the cards on top of my suitcase for college - bc after the first day of everyone's small talk we'll have moved on to wanting to DO something - and what better what to get to know people then after a great game of spoons -- or death spoons -- nothing like bonding over trying to kill each other over spoons. 

Well - the Gonzaga dinner was last night. It started off to be the awkward stare at each other and then ur food night but it ended up well - and my mom and i were the last to leave after all our random questions. But a friend from Brophy that was on Mayor's Youth Committee with me was there and it was awesome. I was soooo happy cause now i'll have 3 friends up there - he's even staying in the same dorm :) 
The dinner gave me this wave of excitement that makes me honestly jump every time i think about leaving...

hows everyone doin?"

"event","I have my ROOMMATE!!! She called today :)
Her name is Allyson - we talked for an hour and a half... 
my mom talked to her first cause i wasn't home and my mom said that she's from Yaccamuck WA - and she lives on a farm that grows grapes and Apples... so i figured GREAT I'll be living with ""Little House on the Prarie"" for a year...

THANKFULLY I was wrong. She's very cool and it looks like it'll work out nicely. We share a lot of common interests and it looks like i even have a buddy to go to church with. Even tho she's from WA she doesnt' know a lot of people that are going to Gonzaga. (her parents met there - as well as her brother and his wife...cute huh?) so that means that i won't have a flake roommate who leaves me alone the day after move in day :) 
I just hope that she's as solid as she sounds cause i would hate to get there and be disapointed

Anywaz - 3 weeks until i leave. 

I tried to send out a mass e-mailing but so many got returned - i have my school e-mail and mailing address if anyone is interested! (Us far away college students need some lovin too you know ;) )
Britney is leaving tomorrow at 8 AM - scary huh? She's the first to go - and it wasn't nearly as hard as I thought. Granted I'll miss her a lot and miss hanging out with her but it was comforting to know that I could say goodbye for once without crying...perhaps I'll be able to get on with this moving experience after all...

It's because my family likes to get up exceedingly early in the morning...and of course if they are up then they believe everyone else should be up too. Forget the fact that i worked until 10:30 last night and didn't get to sleep until about 1....that doesn't matter-if the family is up then Ann has to be up too - i mean WHO DOESN'T VACUUM AT 8 AM? 

For the record: Im not bitter

So today is a beautiful day -- well besides the war on the homefront -- it's wonderful... 
A) today is my last open swim day of the SEASON - whoohoo for pools closing on Aug 1
B) I get to see my friends today :) Oh and play games all night - horray for friends who don't mind being dorks for a night :)

Im happy that today was the last day of the pool being open 1-7 next week is the last week *only open 1-5 with means no more drained grumpy Ann :)
The major down to this is that my paycheck will be severely LESS... Oh well there is more to life then money.

"event","Ok - so here's Ann's life in a nutshell...

Wake up at 8:30 
Go to work at one pool
Drive to another pool
Come home at about 9:30ish
Go to sleep
Wake up at 8:30
Go to work.....etc.

Altho I do have tonight off (b/c I'm already going over hours for the week :))
SO I BELIEVE WE'RE PARTYING.... which consists of probably going to dinner and then to bed ;) 

Ny ways... Tiffany Trask is in town - I didn't know she was coming but apparently neither did she so it's all good. It's good to catch up with her again... those of you who know her should know that she 'ships out' on Feb.8 yes, I said SHIPS OUT as in SHE'S IN THE MILITARY *navy to be specific* Scary huh? 
I'm getting quite 'burnt out' at the pool...litterally burnt out. My skin has turned into a crazy dark NASTY color ... so gross...i tried to scrape it off today... (inside joke...)

well - I want to hang out with yall before i go. Apparently there is a surprise party being planned for me
*(Dialog: 
Chance: ""so we should have a party for ya before you go out of town and leave us for college""
Ann: ""ya - you should plan one it'd be awesome""
Chance: "" well, just let me know when!""
Ann: "" can you make it a surprise party? cause i've always wanted ot have a surprise party...""
Chance: "" um, ok?"")))*
See? So you all should come it's goin to be awesome ;)

It's sad when I rely on the littlest things to keep me going... like the kid at the pool whose mom told me that the first thing she said when they stepped off the plane after vacation was, "" i wanna go to the pool and see Ann"" *tear*

well I'll catch up with you kids later..."

After 2 weeks of traveling/living out of a suitcase...eating food that was slightly less then up to general standards of all things considered ediable...debating every 2 seconds about national/international policies (considering the possible impeachment of Bush - trading sanctions with countries in the UN - whether or not i actually agree with the UN or our policies on hunting whales in relation to aboriginie tribes)sleeping a little less then 5 hours a night ----- All i want to do is go back. 

I had the time of my life...all summed up into 10 amazing days. 
I got to speak my mind publicly about many issues that having been plaguing the minds of American lately - to an audience that apparently respected what I had to say. Having a forum such as the one that was presented to us at the conference was one that i wish everyone had the chance to experience. 
To my friends that I love so dearly : I miss you all already. those of you who i have had the honest privilege of calling you my friend before this conference I can't put into words how wonderful it was to be able to see you again. And this isn't going to be like high school where you say keep in touch in everyone's yearbook knowing that only 2% will.

I was thinking a lot on the bus down the mountain... and i started realizing what i was feeling. 
If any of you have ever fallin in love... and known what it was like to have to leave that person... take that feeling and multiply it by 30. I feel like I fell in love many times over...everyday and now my heart is left with a combined feeling of empty and broken and partially fully. When I was on the bus I felt like all I wanted was another hug from someone who I could honestly say respected me for who I am not WHAT I am. Sometimes it's the memories that keep people alive and thats what seems to be tearing me apart right now. I loved the time spent on the mountian..and it's unfortunately our last all together. I love and miss you all dearly.

So I guess you can chalk me up for being just another person who's heart has been taken this summer..."

The down side is that afterwards I'll have to say goodbye and I don't know when I'll see them ever again. I know that where there is a will there is a way but seriously people's lives get so busy i don't like not knowing when I'll see someone again.. :(
But enough negative - in 4 days i'll be surrounded in people that I absolutely LOVE and care the world for.

I was at my cousins wedding last weekend. FUN stuff. (kinda)
One of the highlights was definately geting this guys phone number ... FROM HIS MOTHER!!! 
Ok so maybe that wasn't as adventurous as it sounds. I actually knew this guy 2 years ago and i ran into his mom who was working at the resort we were staying at and she said that ever since his surgery he's moved closer to home so she gave me his new number and said he'd be happy to hear from me. 
I did catch the bouquet at my cousins wedding tho... 
(and i got to dance with the HOTTEST grooms'men ;) )
Dancing at the wedding was awesome and i got to see my neice - too bad my sister is a B***H

Yes - the inevitable has reached us...GRADUATION... hats off to us. We survived the public school system, not only that but the MESA public school system.

I've been thinking a lot about leaving - and leaving HS is going to be sad but not as sad as thinking about me leaving for college...bc then i'll really be leaving all my friends that are truly my friends, not just the crazy kids that talk to you once a week - your down to earth FRIENDS. 
Yes - the internet will be a lifeline for me and the phone will be well in use, however, talking someone in person just can't be compromised. 
Yes, i fully realize how lucky I am, and I am very much am looking forward to going, however, it's just that right now im walking through a door... and im pausing with my feet still forward to turn and glance over my shoulder... I've also come to realize that sometimes, it's ok to be sad for a while. As the cheerleader that I always try to be to other people this whole graduating thing really puts it into prospective. I almost need to be sad for a while about this so that I can (as Usher puts so well) ""let it burn"".
thank you to all who have been so wonderful to me these years - this is only the begining... please don't loose touch with me... (I'm goin to need some lovin while I'm in WA - as kathryn, kara, carly (and SARAH*(my lil canadian) can agree with me on))

PAYCHECKS COME OUT ON THURS!!! (although I won't see the money anyway ~ it's all going to the deposits for college lately)

Well - computer shopping has been a hassle - ok well - I guess I can't really say that because I haven't been the one really shopping...i've been the one smiling and nodding once in a while while MATT finds me a computer. SHEESH 2 hours and 2 computer stores later (we break for PANDA EXPRESS) then it's to my house.......when he decides to get on my computer to shop comps even more! HA - it's hilarious cause he was talkin all that 'tech talk' assuming I had a clue what he was saying - so he got my dad and they talked for a while. --- This is awesome though - having two people WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKIN ABOUT - find me a quality computer for college at a low price. I am SO appreciative! - I know i'd end up with a HUGE laptop which had more then i wanted on it and pay way too much - so MAJOR props to MATT :)

"event","Wow. I am pretty shaken up right now. 

I just found out that my friend was diagnosed with cancer. There is a large mass in the left pectoral muscle and is going in for surgery in about a month. (This person hasn't really told anyone - so I'd like to keep this anonymous. I don't think any of you would know him anyways (doesn't go to RM, MV, or Brophy))
I called him a moment ago and he's just shaken up. I don't have many details - b/c like I said it's still a major shock to him - and I just wanted to let him know that prayers are coming in.
*sigh*
He's SUCH a good person too - Always giving up time to help out others and just make peoples lives around him better any way he could. 
PLEASE PRAY!!!"

5 weeks of high school left. Which is a hellova long time.

4 months until college - which would be going by faster if I eff*in knew where i was going.

and only about 10 or so days until return to the pool for another fun filled summer...

eh - im sooo full - all i've done is eat for the past week. I think I might be a 'binge' eater.

Last night was 'entertaining' to say the least... I'll just sum it up with one quote:
Sara O: Am I walking on my pants? 

Relay for Life was kinda cool yesterday. It's awesome to see that many people give up a weekend in April to walk for cancer research. the only **and HUGE** downfall were the rediculous JR. High kids - seriously they should be ban from attending this event. ** ok enough of my bitter rant**

I was supposed to go out tonight to take my sister to dinner but now shes going out with friends and I'm getting yelled at for it... um....ya let me know where that makes sense.

I really don't like spending all day traveling - which is what I did from 7 AM to 9 PM on Thurs. and for the other half of today. EISH 
Upside: met a really nice family on the plane...we discussed Amish ppl - hella cool

But there is SERIOUSLY NOTHING IN MICHIGAN. I didn't see more the 30 ppl together at one time. I really was not impressed. There are only 1,100 kids at the school ( RMhigh School is 2,000) I honestly couldn't figure out what ppl did there for fun -until i realized that you just study all the time. And granted you'd be AT COLLEGE for the EDUCATION - i can't study ALL day.

Keep this in mind.... 8 and a half weeks..... that's it only 9 more Mondays... that's manageable. (Unless you have Mr. H)

Saturday night was fun - despite the fact that I went to a dinner in Scottsdale where I knew NO ONE else that was going...And my parents didn't even attend with me :( BUT
despite minor setbacks - I met some girls from Xavier that were very nice. Which makes me more excited bout college. It turned out to be a very lovely evening with GREAT food (which yall know how happy that makes me)

and despite sick old men is Lori's neighborhood, today was relaxing :)
Reading at the 10 mass - Iowa Cafe - Kohl's (and now I own a pink shirt....whoa did you feel that? the earth just stopped) - then to Lori's to run and 'chill' (or as others see it - procrastination from anything worth while)

I have decided that all the people I have loved the most ~ I have had to say goodbye to...or will soon be saying goodbye to. and yet I am still meeting people and getting to know them/knowing I will have to leave. I've asked myself if it is worth it...and every time I come up with the same answer - HELL YA!
Nothing reminds me more about CONA (other than James Taylor) is the Ataries:

Here in this diary,
I write you visions of my summer.
It was the best I ever had.
There were choruses and sing-alongs,
and not a spoken feeling.
I'm knowing that right now is all that matters.
All the nights we stayed up talking
and listening to 80's songs;
quoting lines from all those movies that we love.
It still brings a smile to my face.
 It is SO true...I LOVE YOU GUYS :)"

"event","I am so excited. I love finding good things at cheap prices ( ok so  i know that sounds a little to much like a commercial for K-Mart) Anywaz 
Im goin to Kohl's in a minute... I have to get some slippers :) and I have $10 anything in the store so i might as well use IT. Thanks Sara for a fun time on Friday night. Shopping is usually depressing but that was definitely far from it. I really think you should wear the bright pink and black socks, along with your Kermit watch to prom - it DEFINiTELY works ;) 

I really don't have anyother exciting news.. Except that i got to run this morning - ONE HOUR :) go me :)
~*~
I need to find a way to make $500....... Any suggestions? I think I am going to have another Garage Sale - so if you have ANYTHING to donate you just let me know ASAP ok? 

Oh and this lady at church -darling thing- is giving me a 19"" TV out of the kindness of her heart. Woohooooo I think im goin to take it to college................

cheers!"

"event","I decided to be like all the other livejournal geeks in AZ and say that - oh hey ~ it be RAINING up in here! 
Ya - rain is a sure shock to our system esp. when it hangs out for so long. But more then just the overall shock of the temp being below 80 for so long - I love the rain. It's so lovely. Im sure if I lived in Seattle it would be different but just looking out my window right now there are clouds darker then the circles under my eyes... and thats DARK. 
Today was overall nice - i actually stayed in school for a full day and even hung out for a while at lunch * haven't done that in a while 

I have a web cam starring at me right now... I got it for free and it's not connected b/c frankly don't know what I would do with it - I could meet hot guys on the internet but last time he was a Senior in COLLEGE at Michigan State (quite disappointing). But once I get my own computer and am in college then i will def hook it up and demand that you all get one so that i can see you to. So this is going to be my first of incessant demands... GET A WEB CAM DAMN IT. 

:)
as my friend ( sarah ) that lives in Canada always says
*pixie dust and sprinkles with all my love,

"event","I've talked to an old friend again today. Actually we didn't lose touch - we just don't get around to e-mailing as much. And I don't get around to being in Cali enough as I would like to be (or she doesn't wind up in AZ) ANYWAZ - we were talking about whats going on in our lives and I realized how lucky I am. I have the greatest friends  anyone could ever ask for. And no matter what crap is going on - I can get through anything with you guys. ((*Even in my dream ya'll are amazing ;) <- for those of you who didn't hear - ur probably better for it)) 
I realize that I might be different then other ppl but you respect me for that, and because of that I respect you even more. I love it when im talking about *someone* to someone else and that reminds me of all the reasons I am smiling right now.
I had a dream last night... It was really long (just ask the ppl I made listen to it)and basically - I got dumped for another girl because I wasn't good enough...and then I ended up at Paul's house sleeping on his couch - and we went running in teh morning..ok that sounds really horrid...and I think I need intensive therapy.  WOW - that's depressing - thank GOD it was a DREAM :)
Ok enough of my rambling.
 I am getting better!! I hopefully will have my strength regained soon (Since I still haven't regained it from well..u know..)

I just think of being able to run - now to those of you who promised to run with me when I got better....you better be ready - cause IM COMING OVER ( and i might wear ur clothes ;)

 SMILE - I am :)"

"event","Just noticed that 
 Good news and bad news always seems to be attached to eachother. 

I have to agree with SARA- there are more movies out there that deserve credit than The Lord of the Rings... ok so i didn't see it but i honestly think that Johnny Depp should have gotten his award... he's what made that movie was it was. Many props to him. 

Im so very tired (even tho I had a 4 hour nap :))

Oh - I discovered something about my parents today. 
So I walked into 3rd hour and I asked the teacher what we were doing (MR. H) and I was like - I feel like hell - Im going home - have a good day, walked out --- got into my car and came home.. and my mom said nothing about me walking in the house at 10:30. She's like - Hi Ann how are you doing. 
Then later on I asked her to call in and excuse me cause I ditched and she stared at me in shock - called in - and hasn't said anything since.... thinkin i have to try this again soon :)

I actually get to see Gilmore Girls this week *very exciting - haven't seen it since Dec. 
I am soooo screwed over on math right now - I really don't like RM's math teachers...
AND IM STILL HELLA SICK - but no slowing down for ANN *guess who is now in charge of KIDS GAMES for the neighborhood block party? anyone anyone - oh wait thats ME (*sighs*)

Ok - back to MATH STUDYING"

"event","I don't know how I have been getting so sick lately. 
I stayed home from school b/c i couldn't imagine going to school anyother day in pain. I don't learn anything anyways when im sick at school. 
THIS TIME - we believe that it was strep throat. I've  been sick since Thurs. night. I didn't go to the doctor b/c my parents don't have any insurance for me. (Except car cause that's required)so what do i need to pay $150 for someone to tell me that Im sick? 

Holy shoot - don't take swallowing for granted. Or walking for that matter. I've been having quite a time with both of those tasks. 

All I've been listening to over and over is Howie Day. I absolutely LOVE that music. Many props to Howie...
So i guess I'll go back to bed. I'm almost done with ""Angela's Ashes"" and I'll move on to ""The Joy Luck Club"".

Peace and God Bless

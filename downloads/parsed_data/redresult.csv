And then you open the door to the other room, and immediately get punched in the face.  You then quickly close the door, and sit for another hour.  You're always going to get punched in the face no matter what.  Every hour on the hour.  It's not the circumstances that change, really, it's how you change to them.  Everyone is going to have trials.  Everyone is going to have ups and downs.  One cannot rid themselves of difficulties.  They can only rise above them.  Now I'm not really suffering any great trials at the moment.  But the small ones that I encounter make me realize that the big ones are just more drawn out, or only bigger because I tell myself they are.

All of the verses that I was reading seemed to have particular importance and meaning, the scriptures were seemingly brimming with genius.

Now all I've to do is graduate, and wait.
And then there is the little decision of where to go to school.
My declared major is computer science.  I don't know anything about computers.  I chose Computer Science, not because I'm looking forward to trying implant JAVA in my brain, but because I didn't know  what else to do.  I could've picked english.  But then I wouldn't know what to do with an english degree.  I'm minoring in English instead.

now you may ask yourself.  Doesn't Dave already have a DS?  The answer is, of course, Yes.  I have three games I rarely play for it.  So why would I want this?  I couldn't possibly describe any good reason to spend another 150 on something I already have.  I probably won't buy it, because I don't buy anything, and I want to go to college.  But that won't stop me from drooling.


Oh, and get Guitar Hero.  Everyone buy Guitar Hero.  If you don't have a playstation 2, buy one, then get Guitar Hero.  I don't care who you are.  Buy it.  It's the new way to play games, not lost in a sea of complication and depth of detail and character development, but for the fun and draw of playing.  Not since the glory days of the Super Nintendo have I been drawn to a game so compulsively.  It's where games originated, not from a new world to create yourself in, but to play.  To enjoy a game.  Not to work to level up.  That's a new concept huh."

Nine days and counting until the release of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for the Xbox 360 and the PC.  The game comes out 5 days before my Rough Draft for the English Paper on the symbolic nature of the various humanoid characters from the christianity-influenced Chronicles of Narnia. 

English, save Junior year, has consistently been my favorite subject.  Right now we're reading a little-known piece that perhaps you've heard of...........Catcher in the Rye. The main character, Holden Caulfield is quite the potty-mouth if I must say so myself. Upon reading the novel (book, I don't know if its a novel) the author quickly mentions a certain practice as unholy, as ""whoring"" even.  I am referring to the shameless practice of selling out the themes, characters and story of a great novel and letting it be transformed, downsized, reduced(dare I say) to a made for tv(quality) movie for the purpose of financial empowerment.  The Lord of the Rings series of movies are an obvious exception, seeing as how Mr. Jackson knew an army of raging sword-and-shield fantasy fanatics would storm his homestead and rapidly proceed to burn and pillage his livelihood as well as his loved ones if the movie(s) were not several times more glorious than previously thought possible (which of course they were).  

I recently attended Priest/Laurel conference under the belief that doing so would bring me ever closer to a high-paying (minimum wage) job.  I was enthralled by the experience.  I re-acquainted myself with Mr. Jon Ward.  How quickly had I forgotten how hilariously awesome the young man is in so many ways.  I visited his freshly created website...www.storminmormon.net and found myself thoroughly amused.

It seems to me that the mistakes I make are small in variety, and great in number.  I simply forget too quickly, such as man so often does.  So please, if you find me stumbling about without direction, please do as my parents have done and remind me where to go."

PINK!!!

I ordered Fable, Final Fantasy X, and Wave Race: Blue Storm.  All used.  For a total of $51 (With one-day shipping).  

This is a really good song.  go to Audioslave.com if you want to listen to it.

I want to work at Ign.  Too bad my gpa sucks, and, I can't write to a general public.  

If I get really, really skinny, my legs, which are used to me being plump, will be able to carry me alot farther alot faster.  Operation: losealotofweight. 

I have trouble pushing myself.  Thus, I really surprise people when I do so.   


Xbox 2 is coming this winter.  THIS WINTER!!!

Hot diggity damn!

This winter:

I'll be a senior

The family will reconvene for a short time.

Gamecube, Xbox, and PS2 will face drastic price drops, and become old, as the Xbox 360 will take the place of the PS2 as the new, cool video-game console to have.  

The Game Boy Evolution will either come out, or not come out.  

The new Zelda will be here, and Nintendo fans will be blessed for their faithfulness.

I'll have to apply to colleges. 

Potts will still be playing World of Warcraft.

I'll have been to EFY for the last time.

I will still not know where to go after High School.  I won't know where to go to college.  I wont know what to major in.  

I will still distrust and fear authority figures.  I won't change, merely my surroundings will. 

I'll still stay up late making HUGE livejournal entries.  

I'll never change, only become more of who I am.  

I'll still spend way more time thinking about things in general than the rest of the planet.

You only get one life, make sure it's not spent with closed eyes."

"event","I would've written something sad here, but, those aren't fun to read.  I learned something.  Life is pain.  But not in the way I thought it was. Life is pain in that when you feel alot of pain, you are living, with morelifeness than, no pain.  Of course, that means nothing to anyone, but me.  Pain has left the badness building.  I'll stop trying to make sense, because I'm not good at that anyway. 


Not that everyone is sitting in their room caring about this for hours on end, but, I joined the Track team.  

It sucks.

I'm like a not-so-hairy sloth.  Except I digest faster.  And not as easy going*.  It's really, really, really, really, really hard.  My legs and my back and my shoulders and my back and my chest hurt. (and my back).  

*I'm not as easy-going as the sloth."

"event","The following is a direct question Dave Delong......or anyone else who knows alot about Apple's machines:

I am interested in purchasing a laptop to take to college/play Starcraft/Warcraft III/Warhammer 40k:Dawn of War with friends on.  The iBook looks fancy.  Unfortunately the ibook has a processor speed of a whopping 1.2 ghz, and a bus speed of 133mhz.  Apple uses fancy ""G4"" technology so, I'm hoping that means that it runs faster than your traditional 1.2 ghz, 133 mhz toaster.  The machine I tote currently is an HP 2 ghz, 400 mhz dinosaur.  Old and crappy.  Crappilicious.  Is the iBook faster than 2.0 ghz?  Should I invest in a more advanced model?  A Powerbook? A 1.8 G5 processor moves faster than HP's 3.4 pentium 4, but, G4 has punier leg muscles, so it might not be that great, for what I want to do.  Also, Switchfoot is cool.

"event","...because of the reasons you already know.

Stuff happened.  Somebody said something.  People did things.  There was much thinking involved.  


I've been reading Grapes of Wrath.  And it's good.  The first good book we've read in English.  

Steinbeck is actually intelligent.  He's not a foolish, depressive, writer, writing only to write.  He writes with direction, intent.  And then there's the tie between ""The ghost of old Tom Joad"" by Rage, and the book.  And it's good. good book.  


Madden NFL 2005 is incredibly awesome.  It has actually taught me a lesson about endurance.  If you keep trying, you'll do it.  At times it can even seem that progress is reversing, but, keep doing it, and you'll win through, eventually.

If you're going to fail, you may as well NOT fail.  I mean, really. Screw going out with a bang, go...in.

"event","I am sad.  My friends all went to go see Constantine.  We were playing Halo at my house, but everyone wanted to go do something.  I opted to stay.  Friends and religion ought not conflict.  I thought I knew the right thing to do.  But now I see I have maken a mistake, tracing back to that mistake is the difficult part.  Now all of my friends think that the LDS church randifies people.  The term randifies is kind of an inside term.  

     I wonder that I should've gone.



                                       Wake me up when september ends.

I can't wait for football season."

You are great at finding patterns and relationships between things.
Always curious about how things work, you love to set up experiments.
You need for the world to make sense - and are good at making sense of it.
You have a head for numbers and math ... and you can solve almost any logic puzzle.

You would make a great scientist, engineer, computer programmer, researcher, accountant, or mathematician.

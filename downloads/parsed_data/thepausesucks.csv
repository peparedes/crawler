"event","Well it's new years day, and i'm in calgary.

whatever.

I wish girls liked me more, my life is pretty hard because not enough girls like me as much as i feel they should. 
I think it's about time to make some new years resolutions:
-Be more likable for girls
-Find more obscure/pretentious bands to post about (or invent some)
-have more girls like me
-write wordy free-verse poetry


I was listening to some death cab for cutie and postal service the other day and one of their lyrics really spoke to me. off of the album plans the line that goes ""at night, the sun in the trees..."" The inherent contradiction of commenting on the sun at night time reminds me that i'm lonely and unloved. 

you guys rock, thanks for being the only people in the world who understand my pain. 

peace, love, whatever.

"event","so i've been pretty frickin busy lately. last thursday my buddy Galen called me up and was like ""want a job working construction?"" and i was like ""you know it"" and the rest is history. those of you who know me, and know me well, know that this vocation is kind of ridiculous for me. but i was actually super stoked on the idea. it's been really fun. working with my friend galen, along with a bunch of the manliest men and women you'll ever meet. haha it's been rad.

i saw kevin smith on sunday he was hilarious. good times were shared with old friends.

our fuckin album hasn't been mixed yet. you know that angry face that you can make on msn? that's my face right now.

i'm seeing annie on the 23rd. if we can get the time zones figured out. haha

"event","i love christmas. while my family has some pretty F-ed up dynamics it's still pretty rad to just sit back and spend time with them. me and melissa are no more. i think it was pretty obvious to both of us that neither of us are quite ready for a relationship. I've been working the shift at work that goes from 9 at night to 5:30 in the morning. which has really fucked my body up like crazy. evidence of this is the fact that i'm updating my livejournal at 3:45 on a school night. yup. i definitely have to be up in 3 hours. 
ah well. 

i love going through old pictures. it's one of my favourite things to do. it just makes me all warm and happy inside. especially camp pictures. i need to start taking better care of myself. no more of this midnight shift business. more hanging out with friends, more walks through confederation park alone with my discman, more writing music, more photography. less junk food, more exercise, less computer and tv, more walks with my dog, more time on my own, more time with others, more reading, less work, more school work though. 

annie, i'm getting really excited about the prospects of playing at your school. let me know any details when you get them. i'll try my darndest to make it. i think it would be so crazy fun.

"event","so i saw nine inch nails last night. it was honestly the best show i've ever seen in my entire life. i screamed the lyrics to all of his songs. Hurt was one of the most beautiful things i've seen ever. the visuals were amazing, featuring a 15 minute video they made comparing the natural world to the physical world, highlighting consumerism and the iraq war. he played all of my favourite songs, (except star fuckers) and only played like 5 from his new album. in a 2 hour set, that's not bad. 

they fuckin destroyed the stage too, which kicked ass. death from above started the night off by tossing the throne into the drum kit, ruining it. and the night progressed from there, ending with Trent taking out a light display with his mic stand. 

man, that was awesome.

"event","well shit, it certainly has been awhile. i figure i'll update this thing pretty sparatically, whenever i have a free moment, but seriously, this has been my first free moment in like... several weeks. 

soooo let's recap:

-i've had a couple shifts now at Hmv, and it's frickin awesome. the people i'm working with are wicked and i'm surrounded by music
-my band has been practising twice a week in preparation for our new album that was supposed to be recorded last week but our recording guy had to babysit his kids. which is a pretty good excuse i guess. i'm doing some prerecording tonight though so if you folks want a piece of that i'd be happy to send over some of my new songs.
-a couple of weeks ago i met a girl at the metric show, we've gone out a couple times and it's going pretty well but i'm not too into having a relationship right now, i think i need to fix myself before i can burden someone else with it you know? i've got a lot of shit to work through, and i don't think it'd fair to her if she had to put up with it. here's her website though: www.purevolume.com/nickymarkin she's a musician too which is pretty rad
-caitlin moved to ottawa last week, and i haven't gone out with friends since. i miss her like crazy. she might be the catalyst for a possible trip to ontario in the not-to distant future, in which i would hope to see you guys, if you're not too busy
-Glennis is coming to visit me after christmas... that's right. i'm fuckin awesome. 
-i've been volunteering at a junior high working with their special needs class and it's been like the most awesome experience ever. it really makes me realize that teaching is totally the job for me. 
-oh yeah... and i don't have diabetes."

"event","so my doctor thinks i might have diabetes and told me to get some blood tests done but she assured me that ""it's probably just stress"" and that i've ""got nothing to worry about"". so i took my time getting the blood work done because, quite frankly, i'm not a big fan of needles sucking out my life juices. anyways, so today i'm sitting in bio and we're watching a video on diabetes. and they're going on and on about it and i was noticing that all of the symptoms they were talking about I seem to have been displaying. dramatic weightloss, increase in urination frequency, fatigue, nausea... etc. so i'm getting pretty worked up while watching this video and when it finishes i start to pack up my stuff but, to my surprise, my eyes have stopped working correctly and there's a shortage of blood sugar to my brain and I start to pass out. before i do though my teacher gets me to lay down and put my feet up (which works amazingly well by the way, within seconds I was feeling better). 

so tomorrow i'm going in to get the tests done. hurray!

something i should probably note also is that yesterday i didn't eat anything all day, but went out with my friends and got drunk at a pub. I have a sweet story about that too, but i'll save it for later. so anyways that might have something to do with it also... i miss you guys. much love."

"event","so we're all back from camp now. i miss you guys already. i'm sure you all saw me crying like a dork in the parking lot... actually, in hindsight, that was pretty embarassing. I'll have to learn to hide my face in the future. anyways, I'm finally starting to adjust to calgary again. it's crazy how many friends i seem to have forgotten. I feel so popular, just the other day I was just walking down kensington and i had to stop like 12 times to talk to people I knew. my friends have kept me too busy to do much of anything else really, but i've got a lot to do... I've gotta get all my school shit organized, I've got to find a job (I'm thinking day care centre) and I've decided to start getting certified. This is my list so far of quals to get by next year: NLS, Climbing wall, and remote responder (firstaid). I've come to be at peace with not being on RT next year, what i came to realize nearing the end of the summer was that as long as I'm at camp, I don't really give a shit what my job is. I also realized how much I love being an RCL. i don't know if i would enjoy not working with kids. i see now that it became like an ego thing, wanting RT so badly. like i needed it to reassure myself of my leadership skills. whatever, too much writing. 

basically:
-i miss you guys
-post-camp depression is slowly wearing off
-i'm very busy and important"

"event","I'm now settled into my new house so let's recap on the last little bit of my life. I'll try not to sound too negative if i can. 

-because my dad left and has a new place now we couldn't afford to keep the house so we had to sell it and move into my grandparents' basement. this is not Ideal as I am the only one without a room and am forced to live in a corner of my grandpa's study which he always seems to have a need for. 

-My dad has a new girlfriend who he's been seeing for... quite some time apparently.

- I got an email last night from Guelph saying I didn't get in due to inadequate marks for my program. 

- I've learned a lot about relationships this year and I've had to come to the realization that mine and Renee's is not a very healthy one and given my current situation I can't really handle it... which is incredibly hard to deal with given mine and Renee's history and the feelings we both have for eachother. 

-on a positive note; my band won our battle of the bands competition, but was not able to make it to city-wide because our bassist had to play the lilac festival. it's cool though, we all went down to watch his band play instead and it was rad. good times were shared.

- another positive note: my grad ceremony was last week and me and all my buds went camping for the weekend after. it was exactly what i needed. the aftergrad and the camping trip were both amazing. trust me, there will be stories o' plenty when I get to camp. 

so that's the summary, there's kind of been a lot going on lately so it's hard to recap but I think that gives you all a brief overview. remember Rob's information hotline is always available at 403 612 0870.

was that dangerous to put my number on the internet?"

"event","as suzie so eloquently put, jetsgo screwed her and amanda out of their tickets. which sucks a lot of ass, i was really looking forward to next week. i was really bummed about it on friday night so Renee took it upon herself to cheer me up. so she planned this whole suprise thing for last night. all i knew was that i was to meet her at 4:30 at sunnyside train station. when i met her she took me to Oolong tea house where she bought me tea and we (once again) ran into Ted and Amy. after that, she took me on the train to an undisclosed location which i later discovered was the calgary tower! i'd never been to the calgary tower, it was amazing, she even timed it perfectly (and intentionally) so that we were up there while the sun was setting. after a couple of hours up there we went for pizza then was part 3.

to explain part 3 you first need some background. about a year ago i was trying to cheer Renee up so i took her to kensington and we bought a 6-pack of doughnuts and some juice, which we consumed in Riley park. so part 3 was to go to safeway where we bought a 6-pack of doughnuts and some juice. then we went to Riley park where she revealed the contents of her backpack, she spread out a blanket for us to sit on, and her discman and speakers from which she played some guster and a distillers hoodie for me to wear cause she knew i wouldn't have dressed properly for the cold. then we ate doughnuts and looked at the stars for awhile. it was really awesome. noone ever does that kind of stuff for me, and it's amazing to know that i'm important enough for someone to think to plan all that for me. Renee is amazing, despite everything we've been through lately i'm still sooo glad to have her as a best friend.

Aside:
Suzie, i gave you a call yesterday but you had already left for guelph. I'm glad your and amanda's weeks won't be totally ruined, i also heard that she's going to the dominican republic which is like 1000x better than calgary. i'm sure you two will have a killer spring break. 

i miss you both intensly, have a sweet spring break!!"

(sorry about that by the way I was still a tad drunk) then today me and my dad went out to buddha's veggie resaurant then he helped me buy a guitar :). theeeen i came home opened more presents and had dinner. it was sweet!  

that's all, i'm glad you had a good trip suzie! i'm excited to hear all about it."

"event","man, i guess i was a little naive about everything. or too optimistic. On sunday Renee came over and told me her decision, it was negatory. we talked for a long time about it and i'm bummed but at least we're still friends and that does account for something. after all I've been through with this, after all you've had to read about, it's finally over and i guess for that we can all be thankful.

I still like Renee, i think a part of me always will (as cheezy as that sounds) and the memory of her deep green-brown eyes will live forever in the lyrics of many songs.

my final thoughts on the matter: 

Renee is one of my best friends and probably always will be. being in this emotional proximity made me much more vulnerable to being hurt by her, and i was... several times. throughout everything, though, i still love her (as a friend) and despite all the pain i endured, i think if given the chance to do it all over again, i would. 

some superficial gains:my package came from guster yesterday containing: 
1 guster hoodie, 
1 guster t-shirt, 
1 guster road journal,
1 Guster sticker.

also today i bought 'of malice and a magnum heart' by misery signals on Vinyl."

"event","First order of business. after reading youze guys's journals, i got an overwhelming feeling. well, two feelings. i got really sad cause i miss you so so freaking much. but i also felt sooo excited for the summer. like, you have no idea. the interview, the package from Jay (i'm emailing you about that right now BTW) and Annie's awesome emo post. I'm gonna tell you guys about my day(s) now.


 okay, so thursday was my Socials Final Exam like, the second part. anyways, it was really easy and i feel good aboot it. after the test me, Renee, cait, Helen, Ted, Morgan, natasha, kevin... well yeah, ""the gang"" went to Market Mall we were there for 5 hours. no joke. soemtimes having so many girls as friedns has it's drawbacks. and they never want to go into EB games. 

anyways, after that me Cait and Ren went back to Cait's to start Our Matt & Trey movie-thon. it was awesome, we kicked it off with Orgazmo and Baseketball, me Und Renee shared a blanket and we cuddled (i like her). then she went home and me and cait stayed up chattin til like 5. waking up at 2:30 we booked it over to my place to make it home by 4:00 for my camp interview. which went well. it made me miss Jay a lot though. kay then me and cait stayed up til 6:00 am watching southpark and southpark related stuff and having deep convos. that seems to be our thing. I love caitlin. She puts up with all my low self esteem shit and is just overall the greatest friend anyone could ask for (except you guys of course). after sleeping for a couple hours we had to get up so i could go to work. yeah, apparently i still work at the Bay. I'll tell you the full story sometime. I love my work, me and Callie quoted sweet movies for 3 hours cause noone was shopping today. 

wow, this entry sucked. i was trying to write a lot while not taking up too much of your time and finishing before SNL. speaking of which, talk to you guys later. I fucking love you guys."

Haning out with Ted is weird now. i mean, i love the guy, but girls are always all over him and it makes me kind of feel bad about myself. cause i'm always completely ignored. i just wish i could be an attractive guy that girls find attractive. i also wish i had self esteem, that'd be awesome

so my mom was supposed to drive me home from the show after her party thing, but then she called and told me to walk 10 blocks to the apartment in the -35 degree weather, and when i got their she was blind drunk. so i had to sit at this incredibly boring party waiting for my mom to sober up for several hours. she never did but finally she convinced me to let her drive... i was so terrified the whole way home. fuck, i wish she wouldn't drink. cause then she accused me of being ""judgmental"" because i didn't want her to kill us both in a car accident... man, i can't wait to see you guys. i'm not in a good place right now."

oh yeah, if you guys want to talk with me it'll probably have to be through email now cause my msn is fucked most permanently. or gimme a call. i miss you all quite a lot."

She's a really exceptional girl and i'm soooo glad i met her. despite everything we went through during the summer, all that off and on and hurting eachother stuff, she is still a ray of sunshine in my life. 

then school happened today, it was sort of a shitty day but on last period spare i realized how much i am attracted to anna. she's a really amazing girl, and really really cute. then it hit me how sexually frustrated i am. like, it kinda pisses me off. i'm in grade 12 and i've never even had a real steady girlfriend. i guess it's a mix between being sexually frustrated and just overall lonely. i went on a date with anna awhile ago and it didn't go well, but now that i look back, i was in a shitty state of mind seeing as my parents had gotten split up the day before. maybe i'll give it another try. alright you're all sick of my bantering by now. so i'm done."

last night was my friend Ted's first show with his band ""the atheist hostage and the futuristic lamp"" it was in okotoks, the dirtiest town in all the land. it was really fun. me, cait, renee, helen and galen all danced all the way through their set. unfortunately they're an ""acquired"" taste so the okotoks kids couldn't appreciate their genius. after their set we all went out for dinner at the town restaurant, then toured around their 4 or 5 roads in the freezing cold. i got a little bummed out cause renee kept talking about some dude she thought was attractive. when i say 'kept talking' i don't mean she mentioned him every once and awhile, no no, she went into great detail about every aspect of his apparently perfect body, face and hair. i finally cheered up when her hotty's band played and they turned out to be a terrible hxc band. i think there's a part of me that will always like renee. i guess all i can do is try to get over it and get on with my love life."

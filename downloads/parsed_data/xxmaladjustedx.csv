"event","take it back you know you hate me
my life has much meaning
as a bag filled with dog shit
i'm gonna try to live even if it kills me
and its gonna take me a lifetime
to fucking feel it
and is it even worth it?
do you do you love me?
i fucking asked a question
stop trying to change the subject with your ""yes""
save it for the gun
and don't forget to say please

don't fuck around in here
this is not your house
it's the house of god
and his rule owns you
and it binds me to the fucking ground

and what the fuck is this?
we're all perfect again
i fucking love it
and now i feel like shit again
but i got you
and now we're all perfect again
fucking love to feel this way
god let it stay
i swear i'll be a good boy
just don't let it leave
and if it does
we will be mortal enemies
and you children will bear your sin
they'll wear it on their chest
and we'll all know
i'm the real fucking god here

so don't fuck around
you don't make the rules
he does until he fucks my trust
and its all a chain reaction
so don't act so fucking tight around here
don't walk in here
we fucking float
don't take me the wrong way
i fucking love you
but living is just too much to handle
do you think you could make me stay?"

"event","if it's an ending you want
then take it from me
because i cannot see
what is so intersting
all these things have been around my mind
since the day i hit nine

clouded figures entered the room at night
took my ideas from me
made a self improved version of me
it lives an amazing life
gather around and love what i am not

don't judge me by my words
i'm only a human
nothing i write means shit unless i wrote it quick
this took forever and that's not too long
don't take shit so seriously
we'll all end up dead if we live life correctly.
pray to your god that you live
and fuck me if i don't like your style
i'll be dead in a while.

[note]
(if you didn't know this took a century to write
transcribed again and again
ah fuck it no one wants to read my shit
and who gives a fuck if i don't like you and your fucked up life
am i still writing?
oh oh.
whoops.)
[/note]

a little bit more
and i'll be in god's great hands
six feet under
take my belongings
and don't mourn me
four hundred and fifty
and that's not shifting."

"event","take me to the battle's ground
shape me into what you have found
knock me out, i am done
because i mean nothing to anyone

my friend said he had something to say
told me to stay
i said i know i know
but what could i do?
with these thoughts cutting deep in me
i can't handle these stress wounds
they're taking me apart
and you don't care

because to you and everyone else i'm just a penny
(kill the trust)
i am hardly even considered the least bit important
(fuck the rest)
i am not worth being talked about
no one cares what happens to me
and i don't think i need it anymore

last conversations are so fun
telling people how much i hate everyone
this is such a fucked society
why i stay is a mystery
yeah even to me
and i don't think i should
but i wont die even if i could
it would prove them victorious over me
i can't let that happen

there's nothing here, no sound
i took away the simple
i replaced everything with awkwardness
if we can't get through this
why make it easy for everyone else?

lies
they are forever
and love
is here only when it is permitted
so take my life
i give you the copyrights
just don't let me burn out
with you helping me
maybe i'll give it my all
and take the rest down
fuck the rest
fuck the rest
fuck the best
yeah fuck the rest

because to you and everyone else i'm just a penny
(kill the trust)
i am hardly even considered the least bit important
(fuck the rest)
i am not worth being talked about
no one cares what happens to me

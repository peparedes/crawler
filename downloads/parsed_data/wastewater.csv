"event","I may not have told many people.  But I took sabbatical from LJ during the summer.  I didn't read others, (mostly), and I didn't make any posts except a couple privates.  I did this partially because I am writing an exchange journal with my partner emily, and partly because I get fed up with LJ.  c'est la vie.<br /><br />i've just moved into a new apartment in northampton.  it is beautiful - large, good view, lush douglas fir floors, nice kitchen (dishwasher + disposal) and a new roomate that I am already friends with.  I have never lived with a friend before (in all of my 4 previous apartments) and already I like it.  It is a little incestuous, but of the culturally accepted sort.  <br /><br />i stole a book from the canton public library.  wait, actually i took it and eventually paid the fine for a lost book.  i may have done this intentionally.  it may be out of print, i'm not sure.  mind breaths by allen ginsburg.  it is probably my favorite work of poetry.  i loaned it to a friend.  we actually traded (she gave me howl and other works).  i never got it back.  this was some 7 years ago perhaps.  now, i live with her, and she has it!  <br /><br />

"event","i'm home from scotland (and the rest of that island), unfortunately.  not that there isn't any good to being home.  plenty of friends, too many really.  sunshine, amherst, familiarity, yoga, drucqs in people.
speaking of these last two.  on yoga.  i decided to do bikram yoga for awhile to get in shape sort of before i went back to doing kung fu.  there's a sweet intro deal at bikram yoga amherst, which is actually in sunderland.  the first day of my intro i noticed a strong scent of fresh linens.  pleasant, thought i, innocently, before my mind wandered down the path to more empirical thoughts.  smell of fresh linen always reminds me of cunt.  in a good way of course.  something about fresh clean pussy and fresh clean underwear? or all laundry.  so there's a lot of clean laundry at yoga i think, after all, this smell is intense.  second day of yoga, after witnessing a close up view of the late middle aged woman in front of me's crotch in her bikini shorts then noticing the smell again.  well, i put one and one together and realized that there's a good chance what i was smelling wasn't clean laundry, considering everyone in the room is dripping sweat like a condenser.
my voyeurism reached a new level.  i followed the mechanical animal into another room to watch him kiss an angel.  shoot some blow.  not v. disturbing really.  warnings about blood because of built of scar tissue and dull needles.  barely saw the lighter and the spoon.  water mixed with powder, etc.  yawn.

seeing emily was great.  scotland was so-so.  when i describe it people i feel like i'm not living up to their expectations.  no wild stories.  the beautiful scenery is dull in haze, stone, bare mountains, and sheep.  the culture is where our own derives from largely.  hanging out with em was great though.  we didn't get v. stressed with each other.  there was one time in glasgow that we got upset over reading a map, but it lasted all of five minutes and we were both in terrible moods for other reasons too.  sorry about that day em.  there really were a few bumps on our traveling around, mostly sicknesses of varied sorts.  we were v. lucky to have free accommodations except for two nights during The Haggis Tour of the Isle of Skye and the Highlands.  We stayed in a B&B for those nights, and it was really nice.  Cute bed, our own bathroom to shower together in, breakfast to order in the morning.  mmm.  my friend of a friend andy was extremely hospitable to let us stay in his bed for 4 nights and then hook us up with a friend in glasgow who even had a spare bedroom.  what luck!  i felt really connected to emily.  especially as the trip drew to a close, the sense of urgency to feel each other's presence was overwhelming and i can't say i'm glad to have left.  all in all it was really cool to go to other counties(did i mention england and wales and driving on the left?) than my own and to share it with someone i love.  i have so much to do now that i'm back.  study for gre's, research grad schools, and figure out what i'm doing after august.  if i'm getting a new job or not.  i don't want to make less money, but i also want to be doing something where i'm getting positive professional experience.

"event","I would ""love"" to hear some thoughts on these



""Most people who fall in love have masturbated for a considerable time, and are accustomed to quick, reflex satisfaction whenever they want it.""

""We do not fall in love until we suspect we are ready to leave our parents, and unless we are capable of making a new, dependent attachment.""

""In the ideal progression, if marriage results, any threat to the union will deepend it....seperation aniety....apartness....difficulties with children will only create a firmer bonding.""

""Perhaps the greatest intimacy of an ideal marriage is to turn to sex in death and loss and grief.  To go to a funeral is to have sex afterward, if you can.""

going on to say

""Sex in marriage is the darkest and the best, a celebration of life's most capricious glory and its most permanent sorrow, when one faces seperation from existence itself."

but on the flip side...

maybe if i go to bed when i get home from (insert scheduled activity here) i could wake up and enjoy the wee hours (12-5) which is my favorite time of day.  at least to be alone.

"event","the myth:
8 (or so) things to do after work today

the reality:
dinner, followed by irrating to meanable stomach ache.

what i've eaten in the last 24 hours(or so) (and why they might be hurting my stomach):

reese's peanut butter cups - 4 last night (not likely a source of any long term illness, could contribute to indigestion)

sushi - dynamite roll (coincidental name...), half salmon roll, half yellow tail roll (food poisoning, harmful to lethal bacteria, tapeworm, and all that soy sauce and wasabi certainly help the case for indegestion)

ice cream - large,half cookie dough/peanut butter swirl and half cake batter fudge swirl (food poisoning and bacteria if gone bad,or if bad ingredients used in making, again indigestion makes a case here)

half a bagel - lots of butter (probably safe, but i've eaten like half a stick of butter on bagels this week)

that was all last night
today i had

breakfast - a bagel and an apple  (not too much to worry about here, same with the butter)

lunch - my homemade soup (very suspect, tons of butter, also chicken which was once frozen and curry)
        coffee/chai combo (really strong case for indigestion, but ulcers come to mind as well)
        orange (acid?)
        turkey cookie (actually called clamshell cookie.  shellfish poisoning?jk, no fish involved. just frosting.)

        another four reese's cups before dinner

dinner - heres the kicker.  onions, oil, hot sauce, barbecue sauce old brocolli (we're talkin limp) and chicken that was frozen for a month, and then in the fridge for 5 days, then cooked (indigestion, salmonella, other bacteria, whatever you can get from bad veggies)

and technically, 3 doses of the pink stuff.  and the other half of that bagel, but all after i started being sick.

oh, and stress?  i don't know if i have stress.  what does it feel like?  is it sort of like your wanting to bash your head against your desk, or is it more of a geyser building in your gut and creaking out through your eyes?

so.  i doubt the ice cream or sushi did it.  unless emily feels sick.  i hope it wasn't the chicken cause then i might be in deep shit with chicken bacteria.  i hope its not an ulcer (because sometimes my stomach feels...weird) and i hope it's not indigestion cause i hate the idea of not having a stomach of steel.  actually, i hope i have the stomach flue and have to stay in the bathroom for the next week, cause at least then i'll get some reading done."

leather elbows 
on a tweed coat

is that the best you can do?

yes, i am blind.

------------
add up to?
hmm... 
i'll be glad to take a stab at it, but it might save trouble if you can tell me.  sorry if i sound tense, see below.


second (segundo) - has anyone been watching the new boondocks show?  i think its pretty good, probably better than the strip, and probably won't last because it looks like its trying to be funny, but it isn't.

third - people and me and their compaints about me and my understanding of said compaints about me.
so i argue with everything everyone says.  is it really my fault that some people can't understand that i don't take things seriously enough to argue with them out of spite or malice?  if i question something you say, don't assume its a personal attack.  i don't need a reason to question, its my natural state.  so sue me (at least for using this cliche line).  also connected to the constant inflammation of egos around me (due to their owners being defensive in the face of my well intentioned prodding) is something of people never getting when i'm being sarcastic.  at least lately they don't get it.  can't you understand that i probably didn't mean it if i say something that sounds nasty? no? well okay, then that's probably my fault.  i've hated on peeps before for having faulty communication of their sarcasm.  it sucks, i shouldn't let it happen.

"event","there's an interesting thought that has entered my mind recently.  it came as a result of a conversation i was having about being a whole person.  i was just trying to make a point and i said that we might have all these 'strings' attached to us that are supposed to be attached to certain things.  and it stands to reason that since we can't even see these 'strings', then maybe there are ones that go to things that we have no idea about.  and maybe we have loose 'strings' - ones that are supposed to go somewhere, but don't.  the places that they are supposed to go could be completely and totally foreign, unimaginable, and incomprehensible to us.  another friend was trying to point out something about balance and he ended up giving me a really good example of how this could be.  he said that you can't see dark if you don't have light - you wouldn't recognize it for dark without something to compare it too.   one sort of these strings could be to things that we don't understand because there is no opposite, nothing else that relates to them.    i can't give too definitive an example of what i mean, because it seems that there should be unknowable things that exist."

Okay, so I didn't watch movies for the four years after i graduated high school.  i'm not saying i never did, but not very often.  also, i didn't watch movies that much in high school either.  but there are still a lot of movies that might wanted to be on here that weren't.
jurassic park?
lost in translation?
alladin?

Toy Story?

"event","i think that bill murray's face in the last scene of broken flowers was one of the most empathetic moments i've shared with a character, despite not being a don juan or likely ever having an unknown child."

"event","I think they went kite flying this morning.  I hope it works out.  She said they made an awkward pair.  He seems optimistic.
Broken Flowers was....interesting.  Mostly I didn't get what made him a Don Juan, except that he went through a year period in which he did it with 5 girls.  I can't decide what the title means.  Obviously this Don wants a little more out of life, so maybe he's broken.  The fact that the flowers work make them broken (not that they work that much).  at the end of the movie he's standing there (no flowers to be seen) and he's just made a fool of himself, and is going through all these thoughts about who his son is, who he would be.  That sort of moment is like practically a cliche of my life.  All bound up.





On nights like this
when the world's a bit amiss
and the lights go down
across the trailer park
I get down
I feel had
I feel on the verge of going mad
and then it's time to punch the clock

I put on some make-up
and turn up the tape deck
and pull the wig down on my head
suddenly I'm Miss Midwest
Midnight Checkout Queen
until I head home
and put myself to bed

I look back on where I'm from
look at the woman I've become
and the strangest things
seem suddenly routine
I look up from my Vermouth on the rocks
a gift-wrapped wig still in the box
of towering velveteen.

I put on some make-up
and some LaVern Baker
and pull the wig down from the shelf
Suddenly I'm Miss Beehive 1963
Until I wake up
And turn back to myself

Some girls they have natural ease
they wear it any way they please
with their French flip curls
and perfumed magazines
Wear it up
Let it down
This is the best way that I've found
to be the best you've ever seen

I put on some make-up
and turn up the eight-track
I'm pulling the wig down from the shelf
Suddenly I'm Miss Farrah Fawcett
from TV
until I wake up
and turn back to myself

Shag, bi-level, bob
Dorothy Hammil do,
Sausage curls, chicken wings
It's all because of you
With your blow dried, feather back,
Toni home wave, too
flip, fro, frizz, flop,
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you

I put on some make-up
turn up the eight-track
I'm pulling the wig down from the shelf
Suddenly I'm this punk rock star
of stage and screen
and I ain't never
I'm never turning back"

Near


You are reaching your goals
But I'm still trapped inside of mine
Before the break of day
You will be gone and far away

In solitude
With no place to run or hide
I hear my own mind cry
And I fall just to see you rise

And I will go down on my knees
And pray the best that I can
I want you to be near...
And I will go down on my kness
And try to make you understand
My deepest fear

With pain in my heart
I will travel on my own
To that place inside
Where I can be alone

In solitude
With no place to run or hide
Again I hear this voice cry out
And I fall just to see you rise

And I will go down on my knees
And pray the best that I can
I want you to be near...
And I will go down on my kness
And try to make you understand
My deepest fear

In solitude
With no place to run or hide
I hear my own mind cry
And I fall just to see you rise

And I will go down on my knees
And pray the best that I can
I want you to be near...
And I will go down on my kness
And try to make you understand
My deepest fear"

"event","I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case time and again
I thought about it

You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

You are the bearer of unconditional things
You held your breath and the door for me
Thanks for your patience

You're the best listener that I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long

I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now
I am aware now

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

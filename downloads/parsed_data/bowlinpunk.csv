"event","I moved up a whole four spots from yesterday.  I was in 33rd and now I'm in 29th.  Monday was supposed to be a harder shot, but that's where I do better by playing a completely different line than everyone else.  Yesterday I had to share a little, which pushed the oil to places that made the ball hold in random parts of the backend.  I still managed to move up a few spots, so I was happy.  After bowling yesterday we went to Six Flags over texas!!!  It was a lot of fun, but don't tell mara cause she'll be jealous.  We went on the most amazing roller coaster ever!  It was called Mr. Freeze (after the batman villain played by Arnold Schwartzenegger).  You start off at the end of a tunnel, and the ride has reverse magnets that shoot you out at a starting speed of sixty mph.  You then go in a huge ass loop that's almost straight up, come back down, go on another one, then go straight up a few hundred feet and fall back down backwards and go all the way back through backwards.  It was great.  I'm just trying to find ways to pass the time until I get back home to my amazing, wonderful, beautiful, sexy, cute, fantastic, lovely girlfriend.  I miss her so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to cuddle with her.....

Wish me luck as I prepare for my final day of qualifying and try to give myself enough cushion to have a chance at top 16."

"event","It's about 10:15 central mountain whatever time over here, which means I start the tournament in three hours.  I'm ready.  But I'm even more ready to go back home and hold my mara.  I'm never letting her go, either.  Maybe so she can go to school and stuff, but that's it.  I already feel so bad about leaving her for a week.  I have to make it up to her.  She is the single most amazing person I've ever had the joy of coming in contact with over the course of my life and I hope she knows that.  

Yesterday was a rather boring day, because I practiced over at forum bowl, where Brett was getting pissed at me because I kept striking and calling the shot easy.  I was getting pissed at him, however, because he has Brooke here and he was being a jerk to her and making her upset.  If only he knew how it feels not to have your girlfriend with you right now.....

Anyways, we had a nice family BBQ at my aunt's house where I just hung out with my cousin Lacey.  She's pretty cool and we just made fun of our family the whole time.  She's going to go to some college outside Arlington I've never heard of and live with her sister.  Sounds fun.  I had Jesse, Keith, Steven, and Joey Betts call me last night while I was SLEEPING and ask me to come over to their hotels.  I need rest before the tournament, damnit.  I slept fifteen hours and I'm well rested now.  They're gonna be dead the first day, just held up by adrenaline (which will only last the first two games).  

My amazing girlfriend sent me a text message which has me quite intrigued.  She said she knows where she wants me to propose to her and where she wants to get married.  i read it this morning and I can't ask her yet because she's still probably asleep, but I'm really curious now.  I love her so much and I feel so happy being with her, and I feel like I never have to worry about relationship troubles again.  I trust her nearly completely now.  i haven't thought about her cheating on me this whole trip, because I know she won't.  That's out of the question for me too (except maybe hugging the pillow and wishing it was her).  I'm gonna have some breakfast and get ready for the first day of competition."

"event","The drive up here was sooooo long.  I tried to sleep every minute I wasn't driving.  Driving was the worst part, because it was so incredibly boring.  When we got into Louisiana, we were getting a little tired.  Brett couldn't make it, so we stopped at a little motel in Ruston called the Lincoln Motel...

2:00 A.M, saturday morning
The lobby of the Lincoln Motel was like something out of a 1960's twilight zone episode.  From the chairs to the old ashtrays.  From outside you could see windows on the second floor above the lobby that were pitch black and extremely freaky.  You could almost see someone staring back at you if you looked hard enough.  We were surprised when our room only cost 28 dollars, but we soon found out why.  A short drive past an old playground with a rusted slide and unmoving swings brought us to our room.  At first glance it seemed ok, but under closer inspection it really wasn't.  There was a door connected to the next room that had been nailed shut and then the dresser was pushed up next to it.  Inside the dresser were what appeared to be bits of popcorn chicken.  There was a closet door with a little square of plywood nailed over a large hole, which led to god knows what. The bathroom was great.  The soapdish was gone.  The bathtub was stained and there were curly pubic hairs in the washcloths.  We decided it would be best not to stay.  We ended up sleeping for three hours at a rest stop 30 miles away.

8:00 A.M., saturday morning
We finally made it outside of Dallas and decided to stop for breakfast.  Cracker Barrel never tasted better.

10:00 A.M., saturday morning
We got to my aunt's house where I crashed for four hours, then took a much needed shower and shaved to get ready for check in and practice.

4:00 P.M, saturday afternoon
Ball check in and registration.  I finally met up with all my friends.  Steven was there, Joey and Justin Betts, Keith and Stefanie Nation, Austin Otocki, Jimmy Harris, Matt Tuckfield, Mara's ex....I mean, Zack Rogers, Kevin Hulse, Andrew Koff and a few other random florida people.  I checked in and then Steven and I went over to Don Carter's to practice our first official practice of 2004.

5:30 P.M., saturday afternoon
Steven and I bowled next to each other and he did awesome!  His first game was 107.  I won't tell what I shot, because it was practice.  I did have 6 in a row on the right lane though.  It was fairly easy and I should average 195 or better.  After bowling we went to an authentic texas steakhouse. The steak was amazing....

8:00 P.M. saturday afternoon
Steven and I drove over to Keith's hotel, where we hung out by the pool and played a little poker.  I got to meet a lot of nice people.  I played poker with guys from Seattle, Vancouver, Denver, New York and it was pretty cool.  I won the little tourney, needless to say, and make an easy 20 bucks.  Steven and I drove back here to my aunt's house to sleep, but I had to write to my Mara.  I miss her so much.  I'm beginning to think I should have just stayed at home so I could be with her... today is our nine months and I won't even be able to see her.  I'm really sad about that.  I really love her to death.  She's such an amazing girl to be around.  She always makes me happy.  I'm going to sleep now, so I can dream of her..."

"event","My last day in Miami for ten days.  I don't want to go.  This sucks.  My girlfriend is mean. She wants me to leave, I'm sure.  Now she can have lots of fun while i'm gone.  She won't even be able to read my entries over the next week and a half, so this should be interesting.  She knows what to do if she wants to read them."

"event","Well, this is my first journal entry under this name, and I would like to start out with a shout out to my love, marianne.  She is the most amazing influence in my life right now, and she is the whole reason i am writing this entry in the first place.  I hate to leave her and go to nationals, but my country is calling me.  I have to travel out to Dallas in order to make the cut for nationals.  I'll admit, it's not as amazing as spending my time with her, but i might as well go, since my mom took off work already.I haven't left yet, but i miss her already.  Hopefully she'll put me as a friend on her journal list, so she can read my entries and i can read hers.  I love her so much and i'll keep you,as well as her posted on my trip towards the junior olympic national team.  I love you marianne, and I can't wait until I get back, so i can be with you indefinitely."

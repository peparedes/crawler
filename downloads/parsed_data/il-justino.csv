"event","Today i made my 2nd start of the season and earned my 2nd Win of the season.  I pitched 5 innings, gave up two runs, only one earned run, and two strikeouts.  I was a little wild today with 3 walks in 5 innings, but i hung in there to get the 7-2 win.  I'm now 2-0 with one save, and an ERA around 2.0.  Not too bad!"

"event","Hi journal, I'm taking a break from my Anthropolgy reading because I heard the most appaling comments from a 4'9'' 11 year old girl.  She was trying on sunglass at the Blue Eye and right before she leaves she says to her friend, ""I have to work on my six-pack abs tonight because my Mom INSISTS that I have them to lose my fat.""  I think that is very twisted that her Mom demands her to work out, when she is only 11 years old, just so she can get a head start marketing a predetermined image of herself.  Behavior like this reinforces the notion that you have to live up to somebody elses standards and not your own.  How is it possible for these kids to create their own goals and aspirations when they have predetermined ones imprinted into their behavior?  Everyday I come to work at the mall I see the powerful control advertising has over everybody. Tonight was evidence that the advertising monster even has the power to steal childhoods."

"event","I'm at work right now and really pissed off.  Some punk kid came in earlier today and jacked a pair of sunglasses.  That's crap, and really sketchy.  I'm also really bored and I kinda feel responsible for the stolen glasses(although there was nothing I could do)  I can't wait to get off tonight because I'm so boring and sick of sitting here.  Anyway, once I get home i should start packing up my shit to move into my new apartment, but I'll probably just play video games instead.  I know, i'm a bum, but hey i earned it!  Oh yeah, and you know what pisses me off more than stupid kids stealing sunglasses?  You guessed it: THE YANKEES FUCKING LOST ANOTHER GAME TODAY!!!! ARRRRRGHHH  It's tough when you have emotional mood swings based solely on the outcome of a baseball game, but that's why they say baseball is life.  Talk to you later LJ and Peace!"

"event","It's been a while since I last updated so here's what's happened since then.  I got a job finally!  I finally badgered the people at Eye Gallery to give me a job.  I feel like i don't do anything at this job though and I don't really know anything about selling eye glasses.  It's not bad for now, hopefully kemper can hook me up with hardcore construction for big time cash flizzow.  Anyways, everything in my life is going about average, well except my relationship with Susie.  That is going super super above average! In fact, I'm not sure if there are words to describe how well she makes me feel.  I still haven't figurered out what I want to do as far as a career after college.  However, the prospect of sports managment sounds very thrilling and worthwhile.  But, I can't really be sure at this point in my life.  One thing I'm sure of is that I will make the best situation I can with what I'm given.  Well, that's all I have to say for now.  Goodnight and peace and love to all who read this."

"event","I'm back in Albuquerque for a few days.  It's nice being here for a while, and I'm glad i'm only here for a few days too.  Tonight my Grandma is sleeping in my bed and I have sleep on the couch, bummer!  Anyway, I went out to eat with my mom and grandma tonight, participated in a ""robe ceremony"" for Brandon's graduation, and had one of the toughest workouts I've ever done.  I'm following this baseball workout book that will help me become a better player.  I have long way to go though!  Anyway, I miss Susie, and her phone isn't working!  I'll just have to see her at Dos Hermanos tomorrow.  Finally, the Yankees won today!  This makes 9 in a row and also puts them over .500!   WOW!  I'm so happy about that.  That's just, well it's just great."

"event","AHem!  I have finally caved into creating a live journal!!  Yes my wonderful girlfriend Susie has influenced me into creating a livejournal of my own.  I love reading her journal so much I figured it would be just as fun for her to read my inner thoughts.  Well, here they are...I'm drunk tonight, and really bored too.  Susie is staying the night at her very own apartment and I can't be with her because Natalie is taking my place.  Oh well, Susie is being a good person in letting Natlie stay with her and I admire that.  My hands are getting tired from typing so much, i don't know how susie does her entries.  Goodnight!"

"event","Whoa, I feel like I'm coming back from the ashes. Except, you know, I didn't actually die. After the holidays and being completely buried in my own little world, I've decided to give you mundane people the grace of my presence. Only, not really, I don't really have anything interesting/funny/worth-telling to share.

January has gone by like it was never there, I can't believe we're already 1/12th of the year in and I still don't know what to do with my life. The current research project I'm in was due to end this February, but we got an extension, so the final report won't be handed in until March. Which is both good and bad. And, boring, because no one knows what I'm on about. The point is, I have another month to work on this, before I'm <s>finally</s> free. And, then, I don't know what I'll do. 

I have signed up for like eight classes this semester <i>and</i> I need to find an internship to keep me busy + above bills and all that. Sometimes I really wish I were just... Paris Hilton. Or, had her money, same thing. And, brain - how happy must a person that stupid be? Loads, I tell you. 

Either way, I'm looking at diminished time at the internet, what with having to write my end-of-course dissertation, plus the experimental project we get to do for our last year. I can't believe I'm nearly graduating, I feel like I just started there. Oh well, life gets ahead of me.

I told you there was no point to this. Just... letting people know I'm alive. Sort of.

P.S: I hate Amber for getting me hooked on Heroes. Forever."

The clothes dryer just broke. Which would not be a big deal if I hadn't already spent almost 500 bucks fixing the fridge <i>one week ago</i> and if my monitor hadn't <i>blown up</i> and wasn't currently getting fixed by I don't know how <i>much</i>! Whatever, it's not like I can live without either a monitor or a dryer. So, I'll go on and spend my <i>life savings</i> (haha, yeah, you know... I'm totally financially independent or something) to fix these things.

My father just told me to blame it on my siblings and on the president, because I'll feel better. You know... that sort of works! Except now I feel crummy again, because I was reminded of rent. As in, I have to renew our contract and I forgot to call them this week. Which was stupid of me. I <i>did</i> try it once, though. But, then I completely forgot, because my mind's been elsewhere this week. 

Alright, I'll call them on Monday. And the dryer guy. And I'm making my brother house-sit to wait for the guy this time. Why do I have to be the only one to have to skip appointments to fix these things. Fuck him. Argh. Am I PMSing <i>again</i>? Honestly, sometimes I wish I were a guy. Seriously.

P.S.: I'm just whinging. It's not really <i>that</i> bad.

<lj-cut text=""because i care for your friend's list"">So, it's been awhile again. Nothing much to say, actually. Am delightfully on hols until Sunday, which is making me mildly depressed. You know, two weeks off after a stressful semester at Uni isn't nearly enough. Not to mention that the research project I've been working on for the last 15 months is boring the death out of me, mainly because the stupid Professor who was supposed to be giving us orientation just uses us as her personal secretaries - send e-mail, build web sites, write letters, do personal stuff that has <i>nothing</i> to do with the research - the usual!

So there, instead of working 20 hours a week, I'm working thirty, including Saturdays and events that have nothing to do with us. Of course, I'm still not getting paid, yay! We get financial aid of a minimum wage, but it is <i>so</i> frustrating to be so bloody undervalued like that. My brain can actually go beyond answering the phone and e-mails! I shouldn't even be <i>doing</i> that! Not that I'd mind, if I were <i>being paid</i>. I'm a capitalist pig, damn it!

So, yes... this is the battle of an undergrad. On the one hand, I feel that I am much more qualified than I'm taken for; on the other, people are willing (and oh, are they willing) to exploit your work for a ridiculously small amount of money. So, what choice <i>do</i> you have? You can't just say 'no, I'm not going to work', because when you graduate you won't find anywhere that won't require previous experience. But, since you don't have a diploma, you can never find good internships that are willing to <i>teach</i> and not just exploit.

What do I do, then? Because despite all the anger and disappointment and frustration I go through daily, this woman <i>is</i> an exponent in Brazilian Public Relations and it would be <i>really</i> foolish of me to throw a tantrum and refuse the opportunities I'm getting. I think the only really frustrating bit is that I feel someone trapped - and by myself, mind. Because... I don't know. I <i>know</i> I am more qualified than I am given credit for and I <i>know</i> that this woman knows this, too. And, because I know she knows, it only makes me more frustrated that she is so consciously exploiting me and just... grr. 

You know what's worse? Not knowing what will come. Because I could easily handle all of this if I knew the results would be certain and worth it-- but as it is, I might as well be enduring this to end up unemployed in the near future. <i>Nothing</i> is for sure and it drives me crazy. Not knowing if there's a <i>point</i> to submitting myself like this. And, considering the fact that I <i>will</i> have to make enough to pay for rent in the next two years... I'm mildly concerned!

Not everything is bad, though. Just... anxious here. Hopefully I'll manage to graduate next year, with everyone else. Need to work some credit issues with my uni, but whatever. It's not the end of the world. Why do I stress over this stuff so much? It's so silly.

On a side note, I think I bore people I play with. Seriously... there's no other explanation. It's been a bitter experience and the double-standards irritate me. I need to take a stand. I'll do it... eventually.</lj-cut>

"event","<div align=justify>Hellooooo! I am happy! For once, har har. Well, good news or bad news first?

Bad news is that my usage of car might be limited in the next three days. Good news is that I am now an official driver! We have a temporary permission for the first year of our driving license and mine is up! Of course, I should have seen to it last week, but now I don't have to worry about getting traffic tickets! (Not that I intend on getting any, but you know...). I'm supposed to get it on Thursday, so right now I'm not supposed to be driving. Considering skipping tomorrow, since I already have Wednesday free, anyway.

Other than that, my University is yet again going on strike. I swear, it's like an annual ritual. No one else believes in these strikes as a solution to anything - and, honestly, they always decide for the strikes right before holidays and important events. This time, they decided to start it on this Thursday, one day before the World Cup. I mean... come ooooon, who are you kidding? It's one month to the end of the semester here and they want to screw us over - I agree that the wage they get is a joke, but strikes have proven over and over to not work! These 'political leaders' need some PR classes, is what! Honestly, PR could save the world, didn't you know?

Moving onto brighter territory, THE SOCCER WORLD CUP BEGINS ON FRIDAY!!!!

And, I really don't know how you people aren't excited about it. Here in Brazil, oh my God, the World Cup is like <i>the</i> biggest event of the year. It very nearly beats the sales for Christmas and that is saying a LOT. People paint the streets, decorate houses, stores-- everything! Everything is green and yellow this month and BRAZIL WILL WIN THE HEXACHAMPIONSHIP!

YES! Cheer for us, hoorah!

"event","<div align=justify>Well, well, if it isn't that girl Anna writing again. Or, for the first time. Whichever.

<lj-cut text=""and, because I ramble...""><blockquote>I find myself in a... horrible mood! And, yes, I know that isn't interesting to read, but I said I'd write in this one, so I will. I had class this afternoon, which means I had to get up earlier than I usually do on Saturdays <i>and</i> I think I might be coming down with something. I took some meds, so I feel slightly better.

I've been having trouble sleeping. It's quite annoying, really. I wake up in the middle of the night with body aches and then when I go back to sleep, I get nightmares. You know those nightmares about ghosts and spirits? I've been having them a lot lately. It's quite odd and slightly frightening. Not so much as it used to be when I was a child, but they're coming back full force this month. I don't know why. I might just need to lose some weight.

There's something familiar about these dreams, which is what annoys me, really. Because, there's a set of spirits, usually a couple of girls and sometimes a little boy. The other night I dreamt this man was shooting everyone on this store I was in, but that was just because of what happened here three weeks ago. I guess it takes some time to elaborate. War is never as ordinary as we are led to believe these days. 

But, that's not the point. I remember when I was a little girl I used to have these dreams and, for some reason, I was <i>sure</i> the room I slept in with my twin brother had ghosts. I still am - after I moved to another room with my sister, I have refused to even go in there. Now,  I can go in there, because it's the computer room at my parents' house, but I still don't like it. And I refuse to sleep in it - yes, it's also the guest room, so to say.

This is funny, isn't it? Someone like me saying she believes in ghosts. I guess it must be, but... see, it's not <i>ghosts</i> or spirits exactly. Just... energy. Some of us are more sensitive than others, right? Bad energy gets to me. It gets me down like you wouldn't believe it. It's alright once you learn to handle it, but it's difficult. Most times, you won't realise what's got you in such a horrible mood or such a depressed state until after the fact. When you think back and rationalise on things.

Oh look, I'm way off topic. I guess this is why I don't write in personal journals - I tend to ramble about things of no pertinence or interest. Anyway, all this was to say that I don't feel all too well. My recently acquired insomnia has been driving me insane and I <i>know</i> there's a cause for it and I've thought of possible causes, but... well, I'm a master at denial. I know what's bothering me and I know I have to fix it or else I'll lose sleep. It's happened before. I just... don't have the guts to face it now.

In another dream analogy, it's sort of that one I sometimes have... about a monster or a witch... and a house... scary, somber... and I'm looking for something... terrified, completely terrified. But, I'm looking - maybe it's a way out of the house, you never know. But, these things bothering me now and making me lose my sleep, are the same thing which the unconscious part of my mind won't let me see. This is why every time I reach that one door, the one I know something so frightening is locked in... I wake up. And, the dream is over and I'm sweating and reaching for the lights. I'll admit it, I'm afraid of the dark.

I hate waking up at night with these feelings. I don't know what's wrong with my life - I can pinpoint maybe one or two things that have been worrying me, but they never made lose sleep before. What is happening? The few hours I am able to sleep, it seems like I'm awake. And, in the morning, my entire body is in pain. I think I need to exercise. No, I know so... maybe, I'll start running. With my body tired, it's possible my mind will give up on staying awake.

Well, that's enough of me whigning.</blockquote></lj-cut>
